<p>This campaign will raise money to pay for a new heater and a winter's worth of heating oil for 91-year-old flatfoot dancing legend Robert Dotson. The remaining funds will go into the <b>Robert Dotson Scholarship Foundation (RDSF), </b>started by the Green Grass Cloggers to honor Robert. This scholarship is to be awarded yearly to an aspiring percussive dancer to attend dance workshops at the Swannanoa Gathering Old-Time Week. <br/></p>
<p>This ""Fun"" Raiser kicks off with a dance celebrating Robert and his <i><b>Walking Step</b></i>. The dance will be held Sunday, October 12, from 2-5pm at the Old Cove Creek School Gym in Sugar Grove, NC. It features 3 great old-time bands - Laurel Creek, The Cork Lickers and the New Southern Ramblers. The Green Grass Cloggers will also be dancing. Please join us in the beautiful mountains near Boone, NC, during the height of the fall foliage colors, for an afternoon of flatfooting and square dancing. The celebration is FREE, but donations for this campaign will be accepted. Please note - NO TAPS on the gym floor!<br/></p>
<p>Robert Dotson is the source of the <i><b>Walking Step</b></i>, a flatfoot step that the <i>Green Grass Cloggers</i> deciphered from his dancing in 1978. This Appalachian percussive flatfoot step changed the way the Green Grass Cloggers improvised in their freestyle step-dancing.  Since that time, <i><b>Dotson's Walking Step</b></i>  has been shared by the <i>Green Grass Cloggers </i>and the <i>Fiddle Puppet Dancers </i>(now <i>Footworks</i>) in performances and workshops throughout the US and overseas and has continued to influenced legions of percussive dancers throughout the world.  <br/></p>
<p>My name is Rodney Sutton, and I was there in 1978 in Sugar Grove, North Carolina, in Robert's dance shack with the Green Grass Cloggers and the Cork Lickers. Robert and his wife Myrtle (both recipients of the 1994 NC Heritage Award) were holding one of their regular potluck, old-time music dance parties, and the little dance house with no interior walls was hanging precariously onto the hillside where Robert had built it. Since that raucous night of music making and all-night dancing, Robert's ""Walking Step"" has opened up the  joy of flatfoot dancing to thousands of folks, and his step is considered a ""must know"" if you want to be a good flatfooter. It is my, and many other folks', belief that Robert's ""Walking Step"" has had a comparable influence on contemporary percussive dance that parallels Earl Scruggs' 3-finger picking on the banjo and Doc Watson's flatpicking on the guitar.  <br/></p>
<p>If by chance you are one of these many dancers, or maybe one of the hundreds of musicians who have played those old-time dance tunes for us to shake-a-leg to -- or maybe you are one of the many admirers of this old-time scene -- well, now here's your chance to chip in to help Robert out. <br/></p>
<p>Robert has slowed down a lot this past year. He continues to be the eternal optimist and says he going to ""beat this"" and get back to how he was a few years ago. But the reality is his many near-death experiences on his farm over the years have taken their toll: he was nearly killed 10 years ago when a loaded gravel dump truck hit him on his tractor -- he was told his dancing days were over and that he might never walk again -- then 5 months later he was back flatfooting on stage at Merlefest. Robert also has emphysema and COPD, diabetes and AFib -- but his heart is strong, and his spirit is even stronger! He is still in good physical shape for ""the shape he is in."" </p>
<p> I have had the pleasure of staying overnight with Robert at his house while I have been working part-time in Boone this past year. Robert is a great storyteller, and he keeps me cracked up with his old mountain sayings and his great sense of humor. He really does live his life following the golden rule -- treating folks like he wants to be treated.</p>
<p>For 22 years, Robert led the dances over at Slagle's Pasture Dance Hall in Elizabethton, Tenn. At that dance and countless other ones throughout the High Country around Boone, Lenoir, and Blowing Rock, North Carolina, Robert has spent the past 70-some years encouraging folks sitting down or standing around watching to come out on the dance floor and flatfoot with him. Now is the time to let him know how much we all appreciate his love and enthusiasm for sharing dancing! With the funds raised here <b></b>you have the chance to help make sure Robert's legacy lives on. Any amount over the $3000 goal to pay for his new heater and fuel for the winter will go into the <b>Robert Dotson Scholarship Foundation.</b><br/></p>
<p>I am handling the funds for this campaign. Robert and I have opened a ""special"" stand-alone checking account so that he can receive donations directly from PayPal through this IndieGoGo campaign. It appears the bank set it up so it looks like it is my account, but that is only because Robert can't see good enough to sign his name - please trust me - all funds raised will go to Robert. His family and neighbors who have helped him over the years are also getting older, and Robert is healthier and sharper mentally than many of them. There are many local agencies and programs that would help Robert (like Meals on Wheels), but he does not qualify because he refuses to give up his truck, and though he hardly ever drives anywhere anymore, he tells the social workers who come out to ""evaluate"" him, ""I can drive any damn where I want to go."" That automatically knocks him out of any assistance programs.<br/></p>
<p>Any donation large or small will be appreciated.<br/></p>
<p>You will see that you can pay online with PayPal or credit card, or you can send a check. If you prefer to write checks, make them payable to Robert Dotson, and mail them to me: Rodney Sutton, P.O. Box 789, Marshall, NC 28753. This way, I can be sure they get deposited into his fundraising account.  In ""For"" or ""Memo"" at the bottom of your checks, please put ""4Robert.""</p>

<h4><b>The story so far...</b></h4>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Everyone knows
that Ireland is the best little country to give birth in…or is it?</span></p>
<p><i>Daughters of the Revolution</i> is a satirical, musical, and irreverent play,
examining exactly what women have to go through to get from pregnancy to birth.
</p>
<p>And once you
go down the rabbit-hole of the maternity services…who knows what could happen.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We just had a very successful sold-out run at the Harbour Playhouse with an excellent reception to the performance and art installation. The post-show discussions with professionals from the maternity services in conversation with the audience was also very successful.</p>
<p>Participants included Prof Chris Fitzpatrick, former master of the Coombe hospital, Marie O'Connor from Survivors of Symphysiotomy, and Philomena Canning midwife and co-founder of Midwives4Choice.</p>
<p>We also had a nice write-up in the Irish Times:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/health-family/down-the-rabbit-hole-of-maternity-who-knows-what-can-happen-1.2557059"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/health-family/down-the-rabbit-hole-of-maternity-who-knows-what-can-happen-1.2557059</a><br/><br/>We now have video footage, photos, and audio recordings of the post-show discussions that will be made publicly available through podcasts on <a href=""http://www.4elements.ie"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.4elements.ie</a></p>
<b>The next step is to take Daughters of the Revolution on tour...</b>
<p>Join our heroine Evelyn Murphy on
her epic journey through maternity, as she bravely contends with consultants, her
mother, her partner, and the attentions of well-meaning friends.</p>
<p>Evelyn’s story
creates a picture of contemporary Ireland in a time of rising birth-rates,
uncertain economic prospects, and a health service in crisis.  In a year of celebrating uprisings, and
renewed debate around the treatment of women in the Irish Constitution, <i>Daughters of the Revolution </i>asks: how
free are women in Ireland when it comes to maternity? </p>
<p><i>Daughters of the Revolution</i> takes a sardonic look at how women have
to perform to meet the complex demands of society.</p>
<h4>
<b>A word from Kate Harris, writer and director of <i>Daughters of the Revolution</i></b> </h4>
<div>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Hi there! Thank you for checking out our campaign. Here is a little background on how we got here.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">The idea for </span><i style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Daughters
of the Revolution</i><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> started a few years ago with the birth of my
own daughter.  My experience of the Irish
maternity services was bewildering and often inexplicably infuriating, so being a theatre
maker I responded by making theatre. </span><br/></p>
<p>In 2013 CREATE awarded me a grant to
research women’s experience of maternity in Ireland.  I ran workshops with women, talked to researchers,
academics, medical practitioners, and student-midwives.  The result is a satirical and largely irreverent look at pregnancy, birth, and the HSE. </p>
<p>At the heart of this play is the question of power, and when
we’re talking about women’s bodies especially in Ireland, it is all about who has
the power.  </p>
<p>It is an intensely exciting time to be a woman
making theatre in Ireland. </p>
<p>Join the revolution, with your help we can bring women's voices and experience centre-stage.</p>
</div>
<h4>
</h4>
<h4>But wait...there is more</h4>
<p>We are going
take you on a massive journey of sight, sound, and dialogue through the maternity
experience. The play, <i>Daughters of the

<h4>The impact:</h4>
<p><i>Daughters of the Revolution</i> is an experiment in using art and
performance to shape a public response to the crisis in the Irish maternity
services. We are women exploring the underlying conflict between women’s bodily
autonomy and the law, with humour and our unique insight on the experience of
maternity in Ireland.  </p>
<p>This
response is both timely and necessary. Since the death of Savita Halappanavar
in University Hospital Galway in October 2012, the maternity services in Ireland have been
in a state of continued crisis. The 8th amendment of the Irish constitution has
also come under renewed scrutiny in the aftermath of Savita’s death, and the
Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act, especially in light of the ‘Y’ case, has done nothing to halt public disquiet in that area.</p>
<p>In the
contested narrative of maternity in Ireland, it is time for women to have their

</div></div>","The story so far...
Everyone knows
that Ireland is the best little country to give birth in…or is it?
Daughters of the Revolution is a satirical, musical, and irreverent play,
examining exactly what women have to go through to get from pregnancy to birth.

And once you
go down the rabbit-hole of the maternity services…who knows what could happen.

We just had a very successful sold-out run at the Harbour Playhouse with an excellent reception to the performance and art installation. The post-show discussions with professionals from the maternity services in conversation with the audience was also very successful.
Participants included Prof Chris Fitzpatrick, former master of the Coombe hospital, Marie O'Connor from Survivors of Symphysiotomy, and Philomena Canning midwife and co-founder of Midwives4Choice.
We also had a nice write-up in the Irish Times:
http://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/health-family/down-the-rabbit-hole-of-maternity-who-knows-what-can-happen-1.2557059We now have video footage, photos, and audio recordings of the post-show discussions that will be made publicly available through podcasts on www.4elements.ie
The next step is to take Daughters of the Revolution on tour...
Join our heroine Evelyn Murphy on
her epic journey through maternity, as she bravely contends with consultants, her
mother, her partner, and the attentions of well-meaning friends.
Evelyn’s story
creates a picture of contemporary Ireland in a time of rising birth-rates,
uncertain economic prospects, and a health service in crisis.  In a year of celebrating uprisings, and
renewed debate around the treatment of women in the Irish Constitution, Daughters of the Revolution asks: how
free are women in Ireland when it comes to maternity? 
Daughters of the Revolution takes a sardonic look at how women have
to perform to meet the complex demands of society.

A word from Kate Harris, writer and director of Daughters of the Revolution 

Hi there! Thank you for checking out our campaign. Here is a little background on how we got here.
The idea for Daughters
of the Revolution started a few years ago with the birth of my
own daughter.  My experience of the Irish
maternity services was bewildering and often inexplicably infuriating, so being a theatre
maker I responded by making theatre. 
In 2013 CREATE awarded me a grant to
research women’s experience of maternity in Ireland.  I ran workshops with women, talked to researchers,
academics, medical practitioners, and student-midwives.  The result is a satirical and largely irreverent look at pregnancy, birth, and the HSE. 
At the heart of this play is the question of power, and when
we’re talking about women’s bodies especially in Ireland, it is all about who has
the power.  
It is an intensely exciting time to be a woman
making theatre in Ireland. 
Join the revolution, with your help we can bring women's voices and experience centre-stage.



But wait...there is more
We are going
take you on a massive journey of sight, sound, and dialogue through the maternity
experience. The play, Daughters of the
Revolution, will be framed by an art installation before the show and an
expert panel discussion each night following the performance.
4elements’ Artist in Residence Coral Mallow
will transform the entrance to the theatre space into an interactive art installation.  Centred on issues of agency and body autonomy as experienced by
women in the Irish maternity services, the exhibition will investigate the
social perceptions around maternity.
The exhibition
will also include contributions
from the artist Anne Marie Kilshaw-Visual Arts Director of the Complex, Paul Timon from the Dublin
Camera Club, and Martina Hynan with excerpts from her 'Keeping Mum' project with the Claire Birth Project. 
Having started
a conversation through art and performance, we will extend the
conversation through a series of chaired post-show discussions.
The panel
will bring together experts in the field of maternity and social policy to
engage in open and honest dialogue with the audience in a safe, creative space.
The conversations will be recorded and edited to be uploaded as podcasts to a
dedicated SoundCloud account under the title Daughters of Revolution.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My fellow classmates and I are soon to be seniors at Millikin University. And we are looking to do something huge! We plan to direct our own production of the tribal rock musical HAIR on Millikin University's campus. This will be a good culmination of our theatre education while at school and an impactful way to start off our senior year. By casting the show this spring and rehearsing over the summer, we hope to produce HAIR on September 15th on our own school quad.  We need your help!  Shows are not cheap to produce.  But we think this one's message is worth it.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>HAIR is not only a musical, but a movement. In the 60's it addressed issues in America involving, race, drugs, free love, war, peace, and what it really means to be an American. It is clearly evident that the problems we faced in the 60's are the same problems we face today. People are just as divided about the War on Terror as they where with the Vietnam War. The right for the freedom to marry draws parallels to the civil rights struggle we as a nation faced in the 1960's. The economic and political climate in this nation is bubbling. Time Magazine named their Person of the Year for 2011 'The Protestor' and, with the upcoming Presidential election, the youth are showing their direct power in influencing the politics of this nation, making this the perfect time to produce HAIR. </p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>$200 – refundable safety deposit for rights and material</p>
<p>$95 – recorded orchestrations for rehearsals</p>
<p>$25 – campus event security</p>
<p>$25 – refundable prop deposit</p>
<p>$100 – costume rental deposit, costume cleaning</p>
<p>$100- lights rental</p>
<p>$100- miscellaneous production costs</p>
<p>$645 - total</p>

What you may<em> not know</em> is that we've had a <strong>10 year dream of doing this wonderful comedic play where we are cast as hilarious BFF's together. </strong>We first did a scene from this play in college and that sealed our friendship onstage and off. We took it to competition. We're ready to take it to the world.</p>
<p>We're the right age to make these characters really come alive, and the play is hilarious and smart. We have excellent talent attached in the form of a <em>fabulous</em> Director and other highly experienced professional theater folk who are ready to dive head first into this project and make it happen. This is not our first time at the rodeo, we know what it takes to produce a quality theatre production in NYC and we know how to save money doing it while still creating an unforgettable experience for the audience and everyone involved. We have the passion, the time and the drive. We have the talent, the creativity and the plan. What we don't have is...<em><strong>the money.</strong></em></p>
<h3>IF YOU HAVE EVER WANTED TO MAKE SOMEONE'S DREAM COME TRUE, THIS IS YOUR CHANCE. </h3>
<div>
<h3>If you've never helped produce a play before, a lot goes into it!</h3>
<p><strong>We need to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Rent a wonderful space that you'll be comfortable coming to</li>
<li>Purchase materials for the set, props, &amp; costume pieces</li>
<li>Pay for rehearsal space</li>
<li>Pay for the rights</li>
</ul>
<p>...and MUCH more including marketing and promotions so people actually come enjoy it. We don't even plan to pay ourselves. This is a labor of LOVE.</p>
<h3>If we don't make our goal here, we're taking whatever we get and applying it to the list above and will continue to work our butts off making this dream happen. We're not quitters. Let's do this.</h3>

<p><strong>I am Menelik Shabazz, award-winning filmmaker, known as one of the pioneers of black British cinema. I recently produced the acclaimed <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiJof_zx2Uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">THE STORY OF LOVERS ROCK</a> documentary. Now I am on a new adventure a musical theatre play THE AWAKEN ONE. </strong></p>
<p>THE AWAKEN ONE is a story of JASON a young man who enters the spirit world of his ancestors who tells him stories that lead to his transformation and mission to become an guide/angel to help mankind. The story is told against the backdrop of young black men in London and the USA who are killing themselves brutally. The play presents this theme in an original way by taking us into the twilight world of the African Ancestors where the past, present and future meet. There, Jason encounters Malcolm X, Dr Martin Luther King, Marcus Garvey and the Pharaohs of ancient Egypt Akhenaton and Tutankhamen. These encounters make him reflect on his life and journey in both worlds.</p>
<p>I decided to venture into theatre because it is a more direct way of dealing with this project, which I am bursting at the seams to get out.</p>
<p>This project has me feeling so passionate because I want to make a difference to the narrow world that many young blackmen and women are living in and create and create a cross generational story. I want to open up new landscape of ideas and different storytelling through theatre, song, dance, spoken word and multi-media. At the heart I want to tell a universal story that everyone can relate to.</p>
<p>Those of you that know my work will know that I produce work of high standard and work that has a vision and longevity.  I have surrounded myself with a strong cast of actors who have all worked in film, TV and theatre. Including <strong>Angela Wynter </strong>(EastEnders), <strong>Victor Romero Evans </strong>( Burning An Illusion/Mark For Death), Lovers Rock singer <strong>Janet Kay</strong> (Silly Games).</p>
<p>I have already have bookings in theatres in London, and Midlands/ UK and there is a strong interest in the USA and Caribbean.</p>
<p>I am here on Indiegogo to build a community of support for this project because this way allows me to be free to express my vision. It also fits within my vision to involve a community of likeminded people in my work. My film THE STORY OF LOVERS ROCK was previous example of this and I want to translate this experience into this project to keep this concept going.</p>
<p>I am asking for your support to raise $50,000 in order to be able to perform this play and meet the performance dates in October/November.</p>
<p>There are several levels of affordable donations:</p>
<ol>
<li>

<li>
<strong>$150.00</strong> you will receive <strong>a signed certificate from me</strong> and <strong>inclusion in a commemorative booklet.</strong>

</h3>NGD Clothing presents: Battle Grounds.  A dance event that is going to promote urban culture in head to head tournament style battles. Our company NGD Clothing is a street and urban clothing line that specializes in design and print and we aim to design clothing that can be worn by people of all ages, shapes, colors and sizes. NGD Clothing is a company that thrives and receives great inspiration from hiphop culture.  To us at NGD Clothing hiphop is more than just music, it's a lifestyle. Hiphop is a way of life ,a culture. It's a tool that can be used as an outlet that youth and young adults can use in a positive manner to help release and get there voice out there to be heard and seen. Whether it's via fashion, dance, music or any other artistic form. So we at NGD Clothing want to create this event as an opportunity for those who have a passion for dance to showcase there talent and show people what they can do and what they are capable of. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1320220/files/20150323202432-10562951_528964407237793_612724709610562675_n.jpg?1427167472"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

</div> <div> <h3>Event Details:</h3>This event will be held at a local spot in Tempe, Az. However in order to create the best environment possible we will need some assistance from the people to help get the necessary tools and to promote and spread the word in every way we can. Some things needed for the event will be a DJ, Sounds equipment, lighting equipment, staff to help run the event, booths for vendors and other local business owners to showcase they're works, host of the event, judges and other miscellaneous details. Also we need to promote the event to help get publicity so theses dancers and performers can show the whole city what they can do. <br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Event Impact:<br/>
</h3>Any and all contributions will be greatly appreciated. This event is not even about our clothing line or what we do as a company, its about giving those an opportunity to show who they are. There is so much unseen and untapped potential that no one ever sees or has heard of. So many talented people have fallen in between the cracks just because they were never given the opportunity to display themselves. And keeping that in mind we at NGD Clothing have created this event to help bring public those who want to be seen and give an opportunity to be showcased. <br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Event Challenges:</h3>The challenge of the event is simple. Making it a successful event. Without the proper funding there is no way we can put on a successful event that is going to be properly done, property promoted and properly sustained. So if our funding goal is not meant then that means it will be very difficult a good show. We want to make sure this event is going to be the best it possibly can, so a fair opportunity is offered to those who want to be apart of it. Without help then there is a possibility the event will fail and we wont be able to go through with the project at all.<br/><br/><p> </p>
<h3>Event Contributions:</h3>
<p>$1.00 - Thank you! every dollar will be a great contribution towards our goal and will be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>$5.00 - Post Card - You will receive a NGD Clothing post card sent out to you to show how greatly appreciative we are for your contribution. </p>

However in order to create the best environment possible we will need some assistance from the people to help get the necessary tools and to promote and spread the word in every way we can. Some things needed for the event will be a DJ, Sounds equipment, lighting equipment, staff to help run the event, booths for vendors and other local business owners to showcase they're works, host of the event, judges and other miscellaneous details. Also we need to promote the event to help get publicity so theses dancers and performers can show the whole city what they can do. 
  Event Impact:
Any and all contributions will be greatly appreciated. This event is not even about our clothing line or what we do as a company, its about giving those an opportunity to show who they are. There is so much unseen and untapped potential that no one ever sees or has heard of. So many talented people have fallen in between the cracks just because they were never given the opportunity to display themselves. And keeping that in mind we at NGD Clothing have created this event to help bring public those who want to be seen and give an opportunity to be showcased. 
  Event Challenges:The challenge of the event is simple. Making it a successful event. Without the proper funding there is no way we can put on a successful event that is going to be properly done, property promoted and properly sustained. So if our funding goal is not meant then that means it will be very difficult a good show. We want to make sure this event is going to be the best it possibly can, so a fair opportunity is offered to those who want to be apart of it. Without help then there is a possibility the event will fail and we wont be able to go through with the project at all.

<p>Musical of the Year is the story of a composer’s 60-year attempt to write the ultimate award-winning musical. A lovingly irreverent, tongue-in-cheek tribute to the musicals we have known and loved for generations.</p>
<p>In 1958 and college sweethearts Rudy Brown and Lizzy Conlon embark on writing the ultimate award-winning musical.

<h3><strong>Who We Are:</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Mildred’s Umbrella </strong>is a non-profit theater company based in Houston, Texas focused on producing plays by women, increasing gender parity in the performing arts, and promoting unique stories and viewpoints.</p>
<h3>What's going on:</h3>
<p><strong>An anonymous donor has challenged us to raise $5,000 in two weeks. If we meet this challenge the donor will MATCH it! C'mon y'all, who doesn't like a challenge? Read more about why Mildred's Umbrella is important below. </strong></p>
<h3><strong>What We Believe:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Everyone deserves access to great, thought-provoking art, so we keep our prices low and offer free tickets to low-income students.</li>
<li>Artists should be paid for their work. You wouldn’t work for free, so why should they? We pay everyone on our creative teams.</li>
<li>Art should ask questions, help us see things differently and make sense of the world around us. We will not compromise this value just for a show that sells.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>What this means:</strong></h3>
<p>Because we are dedicated to bringing you work you have never seen, plays that offer a different perspective, art that helps you find meaning…sometimes we don’t quite fit in. You know how that is. We make weird art that makes people think and is sometimes hard to explain. Sometimes that’s not super popular like the 7000<sup>th</sup> performance of <i>A Christmas Carol. </i>Sometimes (most times) it is. Because we are ALWAYS working but not always making bank, we absolutely rely on funding from government agencies, foundations, businesses, and individual donors to make all this possible. <strong>TL;DR: Without community support, Mildred’s Umbrella, the only women-focused theatre in Houston, would close. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Don't believe us? <a href=""https://www.houstoniamag.com/articles/2017/8/16/4th-wall-theatre-company-to-close-its-doors-following-abbreviated-season"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Our space-mates just announced they're closing shop due to funding shortfalls.</a> It happens. </strong>Funding from government sources is on the decline. Foundations and businesses are still unsteady following the recession and not willing to take a risk on risky, groundbreaking theatre. People are a little scared at the state of the world and afraid to spend on art instead of a bunker. We understand.</p>
<p>We won’t fault your very realistic and rational fear of the future, but we are here to help you through it. That’s what art does. It makes the fear go away. It brings an ounce of sense (or nonsense) to the world. It’s what we do. It gets us by, gets us to dinner, gets us through, gets us better and more. And it’s why you should help us.</p>
<p><strong>Please donate to Mildred’s Umbrella today. We have a phenomenal season planned and we don’t want to cut a thing. You need art. And right, now, art needs you.  </strong></p>

<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">Directed by Jacey Little</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">Home-sweet-home turns into a haunted house for thirteen-year-old Chris when Carol—her father’s new fiancée—moves in. Struggling with the recent death of her mother, Chris is convinced Carol is evil, but she just can’t persuade Dad. When a mysterious, potentially dangerous but kind of cute creature is found in the family’s backyard, Chris assumes it’s a sign from above to eliminate Carol once and for all. This imaginative, bone-chilling, and wildly funny play brings the notion of dysfunctional family drama to sensationally scary heights.<br/> </p>

Lisa, the onstage playwright, attempts a memory play about her force-of-nature mother, Ann, who though constantly ill manages to heal a community. Besides Lisa and her mom, the show presents doctors and fellow patients at the hospital to which Lisa goes when she finds herself beset by the same sort of disabling allergies as her mother. We are also introduced to residents of the Lansing area, which Ann Kron organized to become a community.</p>

But what's it about?<br/><br/>Romance! Adventure! Murder! Aristocrat Eddie Spangler and valet Jeffrey must learn the meaning of these words and more in this new knockabout Edwardian comedy. Delight in their capers, mix-ups, and the dead bodies left in their wake. <br/><br/>Join Eddie Spangler, an incompetent but optimistic Englishman and his loyal valet, Jeffrey, on a simple matchmaking quest that quickly deteriorates into a race against time when the Machiavellian forces of the aristocracy move to wreak their vengeance. Lord Wiggins is set to inherit Rhodesia upon his marriage to Emily Rhodes, but their romance is faltering. It is up to Eddie and Jeffrey to sort Wiggins out as quickly and violently as possible. Meanwhile – the evil Lord Biggins lurks in the shadows, waiting to execute dark schemes of his own…<br/><br/><a href=""http://www.thehopetheatre.com/productions/cream-tea-incest/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.thehopetheatre.com/productions/cream...</a><br/><br/>From a sell-out run at the 2017 Edinburgh Festival Fringe comes the world’s first 2.5 dimensional show set in a world where every prop and set piece is made out of cardboard.<br/><br/>★★★★ Broadway Baby                      <strong>""Highly Recommended Show""</strong> FringeReview</p><p> </p><h3>Our Story</h3><p>A four hander, written and performed by Benjamin Alborough with Eoin McAndrew, Edward Spence and Aidan Cheng, <i>Cream Tea and Incest </i>has been in development and preview since September 2016 with a rotating cast and creative team. This has done wonders for the show and we're very grateful that so many people have lent their time and talents to it.<br/><br/>We've had the great fortune of performing the play before; for two nights at the 2017 Leicester Comedy Festival, three nights at The Bread &amp; Roses Theatre in April 2017 and a week-long run at Surgeon's Hall at the 2018 Edinburgh Fringe. Our show sold out its run at Edinburgh but we ended up just barely covering our costs. We've already put quite a bit of our own money into the show but we've now reached a stage where we can no longer afford to do this. <br/><br/>All shows that play at The Hope Theatre have to pay their actors a legal wage. This is great and we love Equity's work but we need your help to make it happen! <br/><br/>The show went down well at Edinburgh and we're planning to ramp it up even further as we move to an Off West End theatre. We've increased the size of our team and have a new director and designer.  We're going to transform the inside of The Hope Theatre into a cardboard fortress.</p><p> </p><h3>Why we're doing it</h3><p>The comedy theatre scene is great but it's almost all devised. We wanted to do something completely different; take traditional light comedy inspired by music hall and English farce and modernise it beyond all recognition. <i>Cream Tea and </i><i>Incest</i> is more Road Runner than Oscar Wilde. The characters are psychotic imbeciles, incompetent and recklessly violent; bounding through the plot with little regard for anything other than their own greed and ambition. We wanted the show to be slickly executed and as dense with gags as possible. No set changes, no blackouts, no unnecessary pauses.  The show is very silly and it is very fun.</p><h3>The Hope Theatre</h3><p>From the 10th of April to the 28th of April we have 15 performances at The Hope Theatre in Islington. The Hope is a lovely place to be, to work and to see shows and we're very happy that they were keen to collaborate with us.<br/><br/>Although The Hope Theatre receives no public subsidy, it was the first Off West End venue to open with a house agreement with Equity, the UK’s largest performers union, to ensure a legal wage for all actors, stage managers and box office staff working at the theatre.<br/><br/>Rehearsal fees, performance fees and holiday pay have to be paid weekly in arrears to all the performers in the show and so we can't simply pay from a box office split.

But what's it about?Romance! Adventure! Murder! Aristocrat Eddie Spangler and valet Jeffrey must learn the meaning of these words and more in this new knockabout Edwardian comedy. Delight in their capers, mix-ups, and the dead bodies left in their wake. Join Eddie Spangler, an incompetent but optimistic Englishman and his loyal valet, Jeffrey, on a simple matchmaking quest that quickly deteriorates into a race against time when the Machiavellian forces of the aristocracy move to wreak their vengeance. Lord Wiggins is set to inherit Rhodesia upon his marriage to Emily Rhodes, but their romance is faltering. It is up to Eddie and Jeffrey to sort Wiggins out as quickly and violently as possible. Meanwhile – the evil Lord Biggins lurks in the shadows, waiting to execute dark schemes of his own…http://www.thehopetheatre.com/productions/cream...From a sell-out run at the 2017 Edinburgh Festival Fringe comes the world’s first 2.5 dimensional show set in a world where every prop and set piece is made out of cardboard.★★★★ Broadway Baby                      ""Highly Recommended Show"" FringeReview Our StoryA four hander, written and performed by Benjamin Alborough with Eoin McAndrew, Edward Spence and Aidan Cheng, Cream Tea and Incest has been in development and preview since September 2016 with a rotating cast and creative team. This has done wonders for the show and we're very grateful that so many people have lent their time and talents to it.We've had the great fortune of performing the play before; for two nights at the 2017 Leicester Comedy Festival, three nights at The Bread & Roses Theatre in April 2017 and a week-long run at Surgeon's Hall at the 2018 Edinburgh Fringe. Our show sold out its run at Edinburgh but we ended up just barely covering our costs. We've already put quite a bit of our own money into the show but we've now reached a stage where we can no longer afford to do this. All shows that play at The Hope Theatre have to pay their actors a legal wage. This is great and we love Equity's work but we need your help to make it happen! The show went down well at Edinburgh and we're planning to ramp it up even further as we move to an Off West End theatre. We've increased the size of our team and have a new director and designer.  We're going to transform the inside of The Hope Theatre into a cardboard fortress. Why we're doing itThe comedy theatre scene is great but it's almost all devised. We wanted to do something completely different; take traditional light comedy inspired by music hall and English farce and modernise it beyond all recognition. Cream Tea and Incest is more Road Runner than Oscar Wilde. The characters are psychotic imbeciles, incompetent and recklessly violent; bounding through the plot with little regard for anything other than their own greed and ambition. We wanted the show to be slickly executed and as dense with gags as possible. No set changes, no blackouts, no unnecessary pauses.  The show is very silly and it is very fun.The Hope TheatreFrom the 10th of April to the 28th of April we have 15 performances at The Hope Theatre in Islington. The Hope is a lovely place to be, to work and to see shows and we're very happy that they were keen to collaborate with us.Although The Hope Theatre receives no public subsidy, it was the first Off West End venue to open with a house agreement with Equity, the UK’s largest performers union, to ensure a legal wage for all actors, stage managers and box office staff working at the theatre.Rehearsal fees, performance fees and holiday pay have to be paid weekly in arrears to all the performers in the show and so we can't simply pay from a box office split. This is great for the actors, it means that they don't have to rely exclusively on the marketing team for them to be able to get paid for doing their job. Benjamin Alborough, who also wrote it, will be waiving his fee to help guarantee the wages of the other actors.

<p>So! Five years later, Marie-Pier came to me and was like ""Yo girl! Let's apply for this grant, we will commission Dan Wildand be super awesome and pick up where we left off with our duet and make it new and more mature and cool and we will be epic!"" and I was like ""Right on!""</p>
<p>So we applied for our Ontario Arts Council grant to commission Dan Wild to make this new and more mature and epic and extra cool piece for us. And when we were putting the grant together we were thinking ""They're going to appreciate it so much more if we say we're gunna do some fundraising!"" (It's true, likelihood of receiving a grant is 28.736% higher if you say you will fundraise part of the money.... Umm, kidding, but kind of not.)</p>

<h2><strong>DanceAction at FIDCDMX</strong></h2>
<p>Welcome to <a href=""http://www.carmencaceres.com/#!about/c1se"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Dance</strong>Action</a>. We are a contemporary dance group directed by choreographer Carmen Caceres. We combine the talent of several collaborators in dance, music, drama, and visual arts. All these artists come from diverse backgrounds and have their individual artistic aesthetic, but work together as a team in this creative platform to produce performance art works. Through an interdisciplinary approach that includes dance, music, drama, and visual images, we like to develop works that reflect social issues, people, and relationships.</p>
<p>We were invited to present our most recent work, <strong><i>Game Night</i></strong>, at the First International Contemporary Dance Festival of Mexico City (Primer Festival Internacional de Danza Contemporánea de la Ciudad de México – <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/FIDCDMX"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>FIDCDMX</strong></a>). The Festival takes place from July 29 to August 14, 2016 in Mexico City. Over the course of two weeks, the <strong>FIDCDMX</strong> will showcase over 30 dance companies from all over the world, to present their art to the vibrant community of Mexico City. </p>
<p>We are an emerging dance group with a great desire to continue growing and expanding, making work, sharing it, and inspiring others through the process. This is a unique opportunity for us, and with your help we can make it happen!</p>
<p>The Festival will generously provide meals and accommodation in Mexico City for the six members of our company. With your support we will be able to cover the airfare expenses to travel to Mexico from New York City and present our piece for two consecutive nights at <a href=""http://unteatro.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Un Teatro</a> in Mexico City.</p>
<h3><strong>What is the FIDCDMX?</strong></h3>
<p>The First International Contemporary Dance Festival of Mexico City FIDCDMX emerges as a project that seeks to frame national and international contemporary dance, aiming to promote international collaboration with a variety of remarkable dance proposals. There is no festival of this kind in Mexico City that, not only provides a forum to national companies, but also invites works of other countries and contexts to coexist.</p>
<p>The festival aims to make a program introducing choreographers and companies with innovative artistic projects, of solid contents, and committed to the rigorous work of the body. It also seeks to include young artists and experienced artists, as well as companies of small and large scale, being a priority for their selection, the strength of the works regardless of the trajectory of the creators.</p>
<p><strong><i>Game Night</i></strong><i> is an interactive dance performance that explores people’s behavior in relation to the elements of chance and choice, and how these elements shape human relationships. Two people meet and connect; the crossing of their individual needs determines what kind of relationship they will cultivate. Chance is responsible for putting pieces together, creating a unique configuration of love (or non-love) for each relationship. Watch Game Night’s teaser <a href=""https://vimeo.com/148664429"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here!</a></i></p>
<h3><strong>How Can You Help Us?</strong></h3>
<p>Your contributions will help us raise $3,000 to cover the airfare expenses to travel from New York City to Mexico City in August this year. We are a group of 4 dancers and 2 singers participating in this great production of Game Night. Each one of the flights costs $500. Your generous support will take us to Mexico to share our work with the international dance scene.</p>
<p>Even the smallest contribution is incredibly valuable for us, and we would like to thank you for any donation you can possibly make to DanceAction. Helping us will bring you a lot of joy in many different ways, check out these amazing PERKS:</p>
<p>For any contribution of $10 or more we will be sending you a personal thank you note to your home address.</p>
<p>With a donation of $50 or more you will receive our warm thank you note and a letter size professional picture of DanceAction dedicated to you!</p>
<p>Donating $75 to $150 you will receive one of our merchandise items (tote bag or t-shirt) and a personal invitation to attend one of our private rehearsals.</p>
<p>With a contribution from $151 to $300 we will offer you all the perks above, and invite you and 3 friends of yours to a private composition class in New York where we will lead you through our creative process.</p>
<p>With your donation of $300 or more you will become a long-time friend of DanceAction, with free tickets to all our upcoming shows in New York City, guest access to our private rehearsals giving you the opportunity to witness our creative process, a DVD copy of DanceAction’s latest work Game Night, a DanceAction Photo Book, and 1 merchandise items (tote bag or T-shirt).</p>
<p>Every single contribution is important for us and it will help us to get closer to our goal of traveling to Mexico City for this great opportunity.</p>
<h3><strong>What are our risks?</strong></h3>
<p>We are a very small company and unfortunately at the moment we do not receive any funding or grants to financially cover the costs of our productions, neither to afford a project of this scale. However, we dream big and we work hard to find our ways to overcome the challenges allowing us to create art and present it. Our ultimate goal is to convey a message through our work that will generate social awareness and hopefully will create changes. Led by the urgency of our purpose we decided to take the risk and move forward with this project, even knowing that we will be traveling to a foreign land! We believe that it is crucial to spread our message, inviting audiences from all over the world to have a unique experience witnessing our work. Perhaps our words will resonate somewhere else and make a difference.</p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>As we mentioned, your support is very important for us and we truly appreciate any form of help. Spreading the word about this campaign will be a huge help for us. We strongly believe that if all of us contribute even with one single grain of sand to a project, it will make it possible.</p>
<p>Thank you so much!</p>

Every play travels a unique course, beginning from the idea at its source. The River Prize provides the resources and openness to see where that course will take us.",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p><b><u>The Residency:<br/></u></b></p>
<p>Hello
and welcome to our very first crowdfunder! For those who don’t know us so well,
we are Gavin Robertson and Nicholas Collett and we've been making and touring devised theatre both in the UK and internationally for over twenty years.</p>
<p>We are about to embark on a very exciting and specific Research and Development period.</p>
<p>Through performing each of our shows in Kansas City we were very fortunate to have been invited to apply for a creative residency in Seaside, Florida, USA, by an organisation called 'Escape 2 Create'. Having applied we've been accepted, which is a privilege in itself, and therefore in January 2016 we'll be there developing each of our new solo shows. Those that are familiar with us and/or our work know that since 2012  we've created four solo shows (two each) and collaborated on all of them together. This has given us a distinct style of work and we're now looking at working on the two new solo productions.<br/></p>
<p>We'll be in Seaside for four weeks. We are being provided with accommodation. As part of the scheme we also have a <i>contribution</i>  towards travel. However, we do still need your help! We need two international return flights, plus two internal return flights inside the USA, and even the transfer costs to/from the airport comes to a total of  $200.</p>
<p>So, our research tells us that we need a total - for travel ONLY - of £2000.</p>
<p>So once we're there- what then? Well, alongside developing TWO shows we are, as part of this opportunity, conducting workshops and delivering a performance to local schools.<br/></p>
<p> As part of the style of the work, there is always movement (usually to musical underscore) in place of text. We would like to record this in order to complete the shows on our return to the UK. We don't expect to necessarily return with two fully-fledged productions BUT- BOTH productions will need a promotional trailer in order to help secure bookings. We would like to also ask you therefore for a further £1000 which will enable us to physically shoot this material and edit the results into professional reels in a professional studio. In fact, that amount won't cover the full costs, but it will significantly help! We expect to spend a good portion of our time, in Florida, using the camera (both stills and video) to capture developing work in progress.</p>
<p>We hope you can help us get to our target, especially including the last part. Getting there is only a beginning!<br/></p>
<p>Every penny is
appreciated - so whatever you can spare, even if it is just the time to share
the link, we will be genuinely grateful.  <br/></p>
<p>The SHOWS:</p>
<p><b>""Your Bard"" - Nicholas Collett</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>William Shakespeare  - the greatest playwright the world has ever seen? Or just a front man? A player – or a poet? </p>
<p>Now’s
 your chance to meet Will in person. In the pub. An informal audience 
with the man himself. Nicholas Collett takes the lid off a legend in 
your local – Will’s childhood, adventures at the Globe and what’s it 
like on tour. And whether he wrote all those plays…</p>
<p>He might play a few of the greatest hits, teach you to dance the Volta, or write a sonnet.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, raise your glasses – </p>Your Bard!<br/>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>""An Iron Bar Is Mostly Empty Space"" - Gavin Robertson</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In its way this is a natural follow-up to the first solo show, ‘Crusoe’, as it
looks at the way in which Humans need and want to connect – increasingly so in
a world where virtual living is popular and possible and real interaction reduced. It also
looks at patterns in nature and draws a link between the two seemingly
unconnected subjects.</p>
<p>
</p>

Hello
and welcome to our very first crowdfunder! For those who don’t know us so well,
we are Gavin Robertson and Nicholas Collett and we've been making and touring devised theatre both in the UK and internationally for over twenty years.
We are about to embark on a very exciting and specific Research and Development period.
Through performing each of our shows in Kansas City we were very fortunate to have been invited to apply for a creative residency in Seaside, Florida, USA, by an organisation called 'Escape 2 Create'. Having applied we've been accepted, which is a privilege in itself, and therefore in January 2016 we'll be there developing each of our new solo shows. Those that are familiar with us and/or our work know that since 2012  we've created four solo shows (two each) and collaborated on all of them together. This has given us a distinct style of work and we're now looking at working on the two new solo productions.
We'll be in Seaside for four weeks. We are being provided with accommodation. As part of the scheme we also have a contribution  towards travel. However, we do still need your help! We need two international return flights, plus two internal return flights inside the USA, and even the transfer costs to/from the airport comes to a total of  $200.
So, our research tells us that we need a total - for travel ONLY - of £2000.
So once we're there- what then? Well, alongside developing TWO shows we are, as part of this opportunity, conducting workshops and delivering a performance to local schools.
 As part of the style of the work, there is always movement (usually to musical underscore) in place of text. We would like to record this in order to complete the shows on our return to the UK. We don't expect to necessarily return with two fully-fledged productions BUT- BOTH productions will need a promotional trailer in order to help secure bookings. We would like to also ask you therefore for a further £1000 which will enable us to physically shoot this material and edit the results into professional reels in a professional studio. In fact, that amount won't cover the full costs, but it will significantly help! We expect to spend a good portion of our time, in Florida, using the camera (both stills and video) to capture developing work in progress.
We hope you can help us get to our target, especially including the last part. Getting there is only a beginning!
Every penny is
appreciated - so whatever you can spare, even if it is just the time to share
the link, we will be genuinely grateful.  
The SHOWS:
""Your Bard"" - Nicholas Collett

William Shakespeare  - the greatest playwright the world has ever seen? Or just a front man? A player – or a poet? 
Now’s
 your chance to meet Will in person. In the pub. An informal audience 
with the man himself. Nicholas Collett takes the lid off a legend in 
your local – Will’s childhood, adventures at the Globe and what’s it 
like on tour. And whether he wrote all those plays…
He might play a few of the greatest hits, teach you to dance the Volta, or write a sonnet.
Ladies and gentlemen, raise your glasses – Your Bard!

""An Iron Bar Is Mostly Empty Space"" - Gavin Robertson


In its way this is a natural follow-up to the first solo show, ‘Crusoe’, as it
looks at the way in which Humans need and want to connect – increasingly so in
a world where virtual living is popular and possible and real interaction reduced. It also
looks at patterns in nature and draws a link between the two seemingly
unconnected subjects.


""AN IRON BAR IS
MOSTLY EMPTY SPACE"" is actually a quote
from David P. Barash a Professor of Psychology at the University
of Washington, USA, and in essence refers to the human condition which is ever-changing.
He goes on - ""Even inanimate objects that appear solid and persistent are
revealed by modern physics to be in a constant state of flux"".
Gavin is already doing lots of reading of some quite technical books, as well as watching documentaries and jotting down random quotes and ideas...

We really do hope you feel you can contribute. Obviously our first aim is actually being able to get there so any funding will be prioritised towards the travel costs. This is a unique opportunity for us to spend a month as artists away from the usual pressures of daily life in the UK.

<p><strong>A Letter From the Playwright  </strong></p>
<p>Dear Donors,</p>
<p>I am a Brooklyn based interdisciplinary theatre maker, teaching artist and the daughter of an American Foreign Service officer. I grew up internationally, moving every three years, always observing the United States from the outside looking in. My curiosity as an artist lies in a desire to better understand people and places that confound me—especially those of the country I represent. My one-woman show, <i>Shenandoah</i>, is the embodiment of this desire.</p>
<p>Shenandoah is a young woman trapped by circumstance in the infinite planes of Middle America. Though she dreams of the wider world, comfort and complacency keep her homebound. That is, until the death of her father sets her free. Will she muster up the courage to leave?</p>
<p>My company, Grasshopper Chorus, and I have been invited to bring <i>Shenandoah</i> to this year’s Prague Fringe Festival; the largest English-language theatre festival in continental Europe.</p>
<p>With your support, we hope to seize this opportunity to engage an international audience in our examination of Middle American identity. <i>Shenandoah </i>is a story of mourning and isolation, of delight and self-liberation. It’ll make you laugh and make you cringe, and make you wonder what it means to be American.</p>
<p>Thank you kindly,</p>
<p>Nancy Monahan</p>

<h3>Purchase Tickets</h3>
<p>We are so grateful to the 114 people who backed our Indiegogo fundraiser! <strong>If you're looking to buy tickets for the show, you can <a href=""https://baggageclaim.brownpapertickets.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">do so here</a>.</strong></p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550073273/ltvt7kh2rzcplizaonza.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<h3>Hello! We're Unfiction Works.</h3>
<p>We're an artistic collective that produces narrative-driven circus. We are passionate about telling the stories we often keep hidden. Our first full-length show, Baggage Claim, has been in development since May 2018. We're so excited to share it with you, and we're launching this campaign to sell tickets and raise funds!</p>
</div><div>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550073137/u5bkv4m0zatigwh7cq49.jpg"" src="""" style=""float:right;margin-left:20px;""/><h3>Where will the money go?</h3>
<p>Circus is not cheap! Our overall budget for the show is $9,000, and our goal is to raise at least $5,000 of that through this campaign. Your support will help us pay for the theater rental (payment is due two weeks before opening night!), insurance, circus equipment, props and set design, and stipends for the performers, director, stage manager, choreographer, and lighting and sound tech. We are passionate about paying all of the artists and production staff involved in the show. It's almost impossible to make a living as a performing artist and we are aiming, in our own small way, to help change that.</p>
<h3>Perks!</h3>
<p>If your favorite part of a plane flight is the swag (looking at you, Biscoff cookies and weird earbuds), then you've come to the right place. In addition to general admission and VIP tickets, we're also offering some pretty cool perks for backers of our campaign:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you're not local to Seattle, grab the <strong>Friends from Afar</strong> perk to see an exclusive recording of the whole show</li>
<li>Take an <strong>aerial private lesson </strong>with fabulous coaches Sandy or Danya</li>
<li>Let Andrew help you <strong>assess online dating matches </strong>or <strong>give your profile a makeover</strong>--trust us, he's a professional</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, bring a Tinder date to the show and you'll get <i>a free drink </i>at intermission.</p>
<h3>Pay-what-you-can</h3>
<p>It's important to us that circus is accessible. A portion of tickets for each show will be pay-what-you-can. <a href=""mailto:alicia@unfictionworks.com?subject=Pay-what-you-can"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Email us</a> to get on the list to reserve those!</p>
<h3>Other ways to support us</h3>

<li>Share this Indiegogo campaign with your family and friends!</li>

<h3>The Company</h3>
<p><strong>ALICIA RADFORD</strong> - <i><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Producer, artist</span></i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550034615/rblwvf7hcryigdhjyosi.jpg"" src="""" style=""float:left;margin-right:20px;""/>Alicia Radford is a jill-of-all-trades who has spent the last decade developing a diverse skill set: she is a graphic designer, accountant, seamstress, nonprofit operations professional, and performer. She discovered circus arts in 2014 and immediately fell in love, training at Versatile Arts and then in Portland as part of The Circus Project’s 2017-2018 training and performance company. Her first love is rope, but her current obsession is handbalancing. Alicia is passionate about using circus to tell stories, and creating full-length performance opportunities for artists.</p>
<p><strong>ANDREW FLEWELLING</strong> - <i><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Artist</span></i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550034677/abwbaoxjn8sau3e0fkqr.jpg"" src="""" style=""float:left;margin-right:20px;""/>Andrew, a bartender turned circus performer, has been training in various circus arts for about four years. He has dabbled in many proficiencies from aerial (refining skills mostly on aerial fabric), to partner acrobatics, to hand balancing – he’ll even attempt to juggle, but let’s just say that’s a work in progress. Andrew is fascinated by both the fitness and performance aspects of circus. Andrew’s current focus is integrating partner acrobatics into dynamic storylines. Outside of circus, Andrew is working on nursing school applications with the hope of becoming a nurse practitioner. When he’s not training, he’s either out at the dog park with his boxer, Athena, searching for new books, working on mixed media art projects, or baking things that are part of no one’s diet.</p>
<p><strong>DANYA VOLKOV</strong> - <i><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Artist</span></i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550034833/zdovllpbbsffx9ef0cru.jpg"" src="""" style=""float:left;margin-right:20px;""/>Danya discovered a love for movement arts after watching the 1995 PBS recording of Riverdance, to be quite specific. Since then, she has enjoyed dabbling in various forms of dance, movement, and more recently circus arts. Inspired by the combination of athleticism, grace, and seeming magic of aerial arts, she studies at Versatile Arts, with a favoritism toward tissu. Danya's current interests in the air include translating dynamic rope movements to fabric, hanging from one elbow, and spinning like mad! During the day she is absorbed in developing reusable products and sustainable materials. When not busily tying herself in knots, you may find her curled up with her cat listening to audiobooks, getting lost in the great outdoors, or attending metal shows.</p>
<p><strong>JORGE GARZA</strong> - <i><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Artist</span></i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550035151/evzi2sirad1fblmswpvm.jpg"" src="""" style=""float:left;margin-right:20px;""/>Originally from Mexico, Jorge immigrated to the United States in the summer of 2000, where he pursued a Bachelor's degree in Fine Arts and Media Arts. He discovered the circus world as a hobby in 2008 and fell in love with it. For several years, he tried different circus apparatus such as silks, lyra, Cyr wheel and rope. Rope being his favorite apparatus, he has been training on it for the last five years and finds the simplicity and complexity of the rope its two most attractive qualities. Professionally, Jorge spends a lot of his time working as a 3D designer at a local Industrial Design firm, where he is able to combine his design and creative skills with his passion for aviation. Aside from circus arts, Jorge has a passion for nature, animal conservation, traveling, learning other cultures, languages and ways of life around the world.</p>
<p><strong>KIRSTIE ARNBERG</strong> - <i><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Co-Producer, artist</span></i></p>

She is a social worker by day and an aerialist at night, striving for vulnerability and connection in both work and play. Kirstie fell in love with aerial arts several years ago after years of gymnastics and rock climbing and now has a soft spot for the lyra. Kirstie enjoys integrating her contemplative, yet cheery personality into her aerial art. When she’s not spinning and flipping around, she can be found reading poetry, vintage shopping or having heart to hearts with her loved ones.</p>
<p><strong>SANDRA KOPRIVA</strong> - <i><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Artist</span></i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550035339/bnryar5tg30d9i2z9zbe.jpg"" src="""" style=""float:left;margin-right:20px;""/>Sandra is a former motorcycle mechanic turned circus artist and instructor. Her first experience trying circus aerials was with Beverly Sobelman of Versatile Arts, 12 years ago. She has been learning (and working and learning more), teaching, and performing ever since. She most enjoys working on rope, but thinks she’s done her best work on fabric. She has mainly performed rope, fabric, and doubles trapeze. She works to be strong and emotionally fearless in all parts of her life. When not training, Sandra enjoys studying languages and riding her bicycle.</p>

She took up dance again at the end of grad school and has been high kicking ever since.

</div></div>","Purchase Tickets
We are so grateful to the 114 people who backed our Indiegogo fundraiser! If you're looking to buy tickets for the show, you can do so here.

Hello! We're Unfiction Works.
We're an artistic collective that produces narrative-driven circus. We are passionate about telling the stories we often keep hidden. Our first full-length show, Baggage Claim, has been in development since May 2018. We're so excited to share it with you, and we're launching this campaign to sell tickets and raise funds!

Where will the money go?
Circus is not cheap! Our overall budget for the show is $9,000, and our goal is to raise at least $5,000 of that through this campaign. Your support will help us pay for the theater rental (payment is due two weeks before opening night!), insurance, circus equipment, props and set design, and stipends for the performers, director, stage manager, choreographer, and lighting and sound tech. We are passionate about paying all of the artists and production staff involved in the show. It's almost impossible to make a living as a performing artist and we are aiming, in our own small way, to help change that.
Perks!
If your favorite part of a plane flight is the swag (looking at you, Biscoff cookies and weird earbuds), then you've come to the right place. In addition to general admission and VIP tickets, we're also offering some pretty cool perks for backers of our campaign:

If you're not local to Seattle, grab the Friends from Afar perk to see an exclusive recording of the whole show
Take an aerial private lesson with fabulous coaches Sandy or Danya
Let Andrew help you assess online dating matches or give your profile a makeover--trust us, he's a professional

In fact, bring a Tinder date to the show and you'll get a free drink at intermission.
Pay-what-you-can
It's important to us that circus is accessible. A portion of tickets for each show will be pay-what-you-can. Email us to get on the list to reserve those!

The Company
ALICIA RADFORD - Producer, artist
Alicia Radford is a jill-of-all-trades who has spent the last decade developing a diverse skill set: she is a graphic designer, accountant, seamstress, nonprofit operations professional, and performer. She discovered circus arts in 2014 and immediately fell in love, training at Versatile Arts and then in Portland as part of The Circus Project’s 2017-2018 training and performance company. Her first love is rope, but her current obsession is handbalancing. Alicia is passionate about using circus to tell stories, and creating full-length performance opportunities for artists.
ANDREW FLEWELLING - Artist
Andrew, a bartender turned circus performer, has been training in various circus arts for about four years. He has dabbled in many proficiencies from aerial (refining skills mostly on aerial fabric), to partner acrobatics, to hand balancing – he’ll even attempt to juggle, but let’s just say that’s a work in progress. Andrew is fascinated by both the fitness and performance aspects of circus. Andrew’s current focus is integrating partner acrobatics into dynamic storylines. Outside of circus, Andrew is working on nursing school applications with the hope of becoming a nurse practitioner. When he’s not training, he’s either out at the dog park with his boxer, Athena, searching for new books, working on mixed media art projects, or baking things that are part of no one’s diet.
DANYA VOLKOV - Artist
Danya discovered a love for movement arts after watching the 1995 PBS recording of Riverdance, to be quite specific. Since then, she has enjoyed dabbling in various forms of dance, movement, and more recently circus arts. Inspired by the combination of athleticism, grace, and seeming magic of aerial arts, she studies at Versatile Arts, with a favoritism toward tissu. Danya's current interests in the air include translating dynamic rope movements to fabric, hanging from one elbow, and spinning like mad! During the day she is absorbed in developing reusable products and sustainable materials. When not busily tying herself in knots, you may find her curled up with her cat listening to audiobooks, getting lost in the great outdoors, or attending metal shows.
JORGE GARZA - Artist
Originally from Mexico, Jorge immigrated to the United States in the summer of 2000, where he pursued a Bachelor's degree in Fine Arts and Media Arts. He discovered the circus world as a hobby in 2008 and fell in love with it. For several years, he tried different circus apparatus such as silks, lyra, Cyr wheel and rope. Rope being his favorite apparatus, he has been training on it for the last five years and finds the simplicity and complexity of the rope its two most attractive qualities. Professionally, Jorge spends a lot of his time working as a 3D designer at a local Industrial Design firm, where he is able to combine his design and creative skills with his passion for aviation. Aside from circus arts, Jorge has a passion for nature, animal conservation, traveling, learning other cultures, languages and ways of life around the world.
KIRSTIE ARNBERG - Co-Producer, artist
Kirstie is a queer, Filipina-American woman from southeastern Washington who is enthusiastic about feelings, flowers and flying through the air. She is a social worker by day and an aerialist at night, striving for vulnerability and connection in both work and play. Kirstie fell in love with aerial arts several years ago after years of gymnastics and rock climbing and now has a soft spot for the lyra. Kirstie enjoys integrating her contemplative, yet cheery personality into her aerial art. When she’s not spinning and flipping around, she can be found reading poetry, vintage shopping or having heart to hearts with her loved ones.
SANDRA KOPRIVA - Artist
Sandra is a former motorcycle mechanic turned circus artist and instructor. Her first experience trying circus aerials was with Beverly Sobelman of Versatile Arts, 12 years ago. She has been learning (and working and learning more), teaching, and performing ever since. She most enjoys working on rope, but thinks she’s done her best work on fabric. She has mainly performed rope, fabric, and doubles trapeze. She works to be strong and emotionally fearless in all parts of her life. When not training, Sandra enjoys studying languages and riding her bicycle.
ALEX GOLDSTEIN - Director
Alex Goldstein started dancing as a young child, but stopped to pursue sports and academics. She took up dance again at the end of grad school and has been high kicking ever since. Alex’s undergraduate and graduate degrees are in chemistry, and she worked in software development for 20 years before leaving that world behind to focus on movement. She has danced professionally for a number of Seattle-area companies, and currently dances with the take3 dance project. Alex trains in ballet, performs modern, but finds the most joy in jazz. She discovered circus arts nine years ago. Her favorite apparatus is the one she is not actively hanging onto, but she specializes in rope and single point trapeze. Alex is also a Soma practitioner with her own practice, Enso Bodywork. She has thoroughly enjoyed spending time at the airport with this wonderful cast.

</div></div>","What is ""The Choking Game""?




90 minutes.  Real time.

The Choking Game tells the story of Natalie and Matt, a high school couple from suburban Long Island who use their live amateur internet pornography show, www.thechokinggame.net, as a battleground in their crippling emotional and physical war against one another.  It's Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf? for the YouTube generation.  (Or, more appropriately, 50 Shades of Grey by way of the Disney Channel.)Originally workshopped as part of IRT's 3B Residency in NYC in 2013, The Choking Game brings the voyeurism of our modern technical world into the sweaty intimacy of theater.  ""Watching people watch this show is a fascinating experience"", says playwright-director Kaitlin Colombo. ""We've had full-grown adult men walk out of the theater shaking and sobbing.  At it's core, it's a good old fashion monster movie  - but instead of a ghost or a demon, you just have two angry and terrified teenagers.""Making it's debut as part of their inaugural ""F*ckFest"" (""a sex-tival, if you will""), The Brick provides the perfect space to tell this devastating and visceral story.  ""The entire show will take place in the audience's lap,"" says Colombo.  ""There will be no opportunity to look away or even take a breath as the play flies along at a break-neck speed towards it's devastating and shocking conclusion.""When/Where is The Choking Game?

Where Your Money Goes


We're doing this fast and dirty - it's going to be a minimalistic production so the focus goes completely on the story and the characters.  No bells and whistles - just a boy, a girl, a bed and a laptop.
We've been very lucky so far... People are excited about this show and are being incredibly generous, stepping up to offer us some free rehearsal space, casting services, donations of props/costumes, etc.  AND, as we have the honor of being part of F*ckFest, we don't have to pay to perform in the venue (which, depending on the venue, can typically be upwards of $10,000 per week!).  

It's all coming together - but we still need help as we're missing some vital components.  What components are those?  Here - have a handy diagram...



And that's where you come in!
Every dollar you donate will help us bring this show to life.  And, as The Colombo Company is fiscally sponsored by Fractured Atlas, much of what you donate is fully tax-deductible! 
(And everyone knows - the horror you feel leaving the theater after The Choking Game pales in comparison to the horror of a tax audit!)

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong><u>HERstory Counts presents: SILENCED</u></strong></p>
<p>7 diverse female identified womyn will take the Red Sandcastle stage by storm this December 8<sup>th</sup>-11<sup>th</sup>, 2016. Each womyn will be performing a 10 minute monologue, all auto-biographical in nature, about a true story and experience. Come and see the strength, compassion and love these womyn display on stage as they are telling their true and authentic story about a time in their life where they have been silenced, or have been impacted by another person’s silence.</p>
<p>*This Campaign has been created to help raise funds for performance venue costs, rehearsal costs, production costs, as well as to pay for all the creators and production team for their work. This campaign was also created to spread awareness of what REAL diversity looks like on stage. To see our words into action, support us by donating to this campaign and/or coming to see our show!</p>

<p><strong><u>From our Founder: </u></strong>“HERstory Counts is a project I created in April after over a decade of complaining -which, strangely, got me nowhere. I was complaining about the lack of diversity in our Toronto theatre houses. So many of the womyn in my life felt the same way. There are so many of us -so many talented womyn in this city, in this country, in this world. Where are OUR voices? This was my response to no longer accepting ‘We’re going to be casting diversely’. It’s not just about putting a colour or a race or a size on top of a role, it is about diversity of perspective. That’s what HERstory Counts is: many diverse perspectives. Each of these monologues are autobiographical in nature, and based on a certain theme, which is risky. We know that. I once heard: life is inherently risky. There is only one big risk you should avoid at all costs, and that’s the risk of doing nothing. So, YOU, showing up and coming to our shows, supporting and donating to our company, as well as our projects and bearing witness to this movement is you doing something.""</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hi. My name is Elise Robinson, and I'm a PhD candidate in Theatre and Performance Studies at the University of Georgia. This fall, I'm directing a production of Alice Birch's fantastic feminist play, <i><a href=""https://www.ugatheatre.com/revolt"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Revolt. She said. Revolt again</a>.</i> for UGA's 2018-2019 season. As a director with over two decades of experience, I have long been committed to making my productions accessible to the widest possible audience. Though UGA does not typically offer ASL (American Sign Language) interpreted performances, it is important to me to have at least one ASL-interpreted show during my run. Sadly, my extremely small budget does not stretch to paying for sign-language interpreters, so I am hoping to raise funds so that we can offer this important service to our deaf and hard-of-hearing audience members.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am looking to raise $500 for this campaign. That money will pay for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two ASL interpreters for a single performance (two interpreters is standard for theatrical performances so that dialogues and group conversations can be more clearly interpreted)</li>
<li>The interpreters' preparation time with the script</li>
<li>The interpreters' attendance at rehearsals to familiarize themselves with the production</li>
</ul>
<p>What you get: the satisfaction of making the world a better, more accessible place!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I strongly believe that theatre is an important cultural experience that should be open and available to everyone. Additionally, ASL interpretation is its own art form that can only enhance a theatrical performance for everyone present. In a world that is all too often built along ableist lines, ASL-interpreted performances make theatre more equitable and showcase the expressive art form of sign language.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Can't donate right now? No problem! Help me out by sharing this campaign on all your social media pages! And come see my show!</p>

Who We Are

Founded in August of
2015, PDX Contemporary Ballet is a registered 501(c)(3) and recently announced
their very first full performance season, Prologue
to a Memoir.
For more information
about our first season, click the link belowhttp://www.pdxcb.com/20162017-season/For more information
about the company and its vision, go tohttp://www.pdxcb.com/#our-story

The Rehearsal Space
PDX Contemporary
Ballet has been fortunate enough to rent out a local dance studio for
rehearsals. This large facility has a brand new sprung floor and marley. These
sprung floors are essential to ensure the safety of the dancers by providing a
cushioning effect.This cushioning effect
takes the added impact of shock out of the dancers’ joints and greatly reduces
injury, especially when the dancers jump. Marley, a thin vinyl layer placed on
top of the floor, helps prevent the dancers from slipping while wearing pointe
shoes.Having this dance
space not only protects the dancers but also allows PDX Contemporary Ballet to
expand their repertoire. For the first time this year, PDX Contemporary Ballet
will have the ability to create a full performance season and perform works on
pointe.The Need
For dance companies,
bodies create art. We need to ensure that all of our dancers are dancing in the
best and safest environment possible. Thankfully we have found just the place.
However, it does come with a price.
$6,351
is what we need to
make our studio rental fee for the entire season.
Every little bit helps!
-$13 pays for one hour of rehearsal time
-$44 pays for one day of rehearsal
-$176 pays for one week of rehearsal
-$706 pays for one month of rehearsal
-$2,117 pays for three months of rehearsal

I have been accepted to the international workshop by world famous Attis Theater Company. This means so much to me.

My great interest towards biodynamical acting lays upon its immense capacitiy to create an energy zone through the phsycality of body. Throughout my one month in Athens, what I experience will be my reunion with my own body in order to unleash and release the source of energy in my body and express it on stage. The other thing about biodynamic acting that fascinates me is its strong connection with memory of the body. I believe biodynamic acting can be an evidence of an obscured cultural and artistic universe of which body has never forgotten. Mind may forget but body always remembers.

It is near impossible to find theather funding in Turkey. Unfortunately, attempts to get a scholarhip most often remain unresponded.

Also it is extremely hard to sustain a living Turkey as performer and one has to work in different jobs. Although I have been working for months in different jobs such as tour guiding or babysitting, I could not yet managed to collect enough money for the workshop expenses.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Gravity Arts is a production company founded by Hunter MacNair.   Our goal is to create a network of artists who are glued together by intrinsic curiosity, a knack for the unconventional, and a desire to give.  We are producing our first production, an ambitious adaptation by Hunter MacNair of William Shakespeare's poetic history play ""Richard II"" at the Access Theater opening October 13th.</p>
<p>Hunter MacNair is an actor who has been in New York City for 5 years.  In that time he has worked with and learned from hundreds of fellow actors, directors, musicians, painters, sculptors, filmmakers, etc.  New York is teeming with inspiration and originality and Gravity is how he wants to tie his experiences together.  Gravity is not a theatre troupe.  It is not a record label.  It is a community of artists who are taking the expected and stripping it of all preconceived notions, leaving a canvas reserved for simplicity in storytelling. </p>
<p>With your donation, you will be planting the seeds of what will some day grow into a large tree with branches that extend all directions.  This is a company that will have something for everyone and by contributing, you are giving chances to artists not only now with this production, but down the road after we have made our statement with our very first show.  Your generosity is what will make this thing happen.  </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>After months of planning and design, we have discovered our budget is a necessary $5,000.  We simply do not want to sacrifice the quality of what we make.  This figure will go entirely to the show and will be spent on (but not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>Theater rental (Access Theater Gallery Space)</li>
<li>Rehearsal Space</li>
<li>Props and wardrobe</li>
<li>Set</li>
<li>Paying artists</li>
<li>Marketing</li>
<li>Stage manager</li>
</ul>
<p>We need to make sure all outside artists are compensated for their help.  Gravity will not be taking any of these funds for itself.  It all goes to the show.  </p>
<p>You can see our perks listed on the right side of the screen.  No donation is too small and comes with our deepest gratitude.  With your investment, you can someday say, ""I was a part of the beginning.""  You'll thank yourself later.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, Gravity Arts is not a theatre company.  Plays are familiar ground with who we are right now and this particular production is designed to encompass what we are all about: brevity, originality, and transcendence.  Down the road Gravity will share the talents of many other artists whose talents lie in different mediums.  By supporting our premier venture, you are investing in the quality of how we introduce ourselves to the world.  From there we grow. </p>
<p>Gravity is the phenomenon that has shaped the Universe.   Things with energy, such as stars, are attracted to each other, thus creating galaxies, solar systems, life.  It is not a force.  In the absolute broadest of terms, it is the result of space and time coexisting.  It gives and takes, leaving us with a sense of balance.  Gravity Arts wants to emulate that balance.  How do we do this?  By getting behind ventures that meld the past with the future, the compassionate with the merciless, the dark with the light.  On top of that, we are here to give a platform to artists in all different mediums.  Gravity Arts wants to spread the love, but to do that we ask for yours first. </p>
<p>By supporting Richard II you are helping this immediate production.  But it goes deeper than that.  With the success of this show, we will be able to continue our tireless work on other projects in the future.  Our Richard II is an innovative, fast-moving, colorful piece of poetry delivered by an extraordinarily small cast of 3.  We are ready to share with the people and would be honored to have your involvement, no matter how big or small.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Share us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and everything else with your friends and family!  Especially that rich, eccentric uncle of yours.  Every dollar is helpful and goes toward the show.  We are also going to need physical hands their at the space, so if you want to contribute your time as an usher or helping us get the space together pre-performance, we could use it.  Even get a seat to the show out of it.  So again, please share us with everyone and we hope to see you this October at Richard II.</p>

<h3>The Project  </h3>
<p>In the Bay Area there is a wonderfully diverse and vibrant contemporary dance community. However, a gap exists in the understanding of highly influential historical dance forms on the dance and music we enjoy today. We strive to make historical dance relevant for modern audiences, enticing our contemporaries to take a new look at the past.</p>
<p>Through performances of ""The Dancing Master"" we hope to revive an appreciation of baroque dance and its influence on music through time by offering two fun and fully-costumed one-hour performances of baroque dances as they influenced the music of J. S. Bach.</p>
<p>True reconstructions of 18th century dances are rarely seen in the Bay Area.  Connections will be sought between specific Bach compositions and 18th century dances. By performing them together we hope to transport audiences to a time when this collaboration between music and dance flourished.</p>
<p>Performances will be held in San Francisco and Berkeley, California in March of 2019</p>
<p><strong>Before each performance, a 30-minute pre-concert talk will include an invitation for the audience to learn a simple Baroque social dance with us.</strong></p>
<h3>Dates and Venues</h3>
<p><strong>Saturday, March 2, 2019: St. Mark's Lutheran Church, San Francisco: 7:30p.m.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sunday, March 3, 2019: St. Clement's Episcopal Church, Berkeley: 2:00p.m.</strong></p>

<h3>The Producers</h3>
<p><strong>Jennifer Meller</strong> formed <strong>San Francisco Renaissance Dancers (SFRD)</strong> in 2012 after she joined well-established early music choir San Francisco Renaissance Voices (SFRV) as a dancer in 2011. She was promoted to the role of Dance Director in 2012 and formed the SFRD company to specialize in recreations of early operas from Medieval, Renaissance, and Baroque eras. Since then, Jen has been choreographing, performing, and making costumes for productions with local early music ensembles including “The Play of Daniel”, ""Ordo Virtutum"", “Venus and Adonis”, and  “Dido and Aeneas”.</p>
<p><strong>Vicki Melin </strong>(traverso) and Katherine Heater (harpsichord) formed <strong>Nash Baroque </strong>in 2013 and presents concerts for festivals and chamber series as well as benefits to fund children’s music education. Members of the group are professional musicians who have advanced performance degrees from the Royal Conservatory in The Hague, and the Sweelinck Conservatory of Amsterdam. Nash Baroque Ensemble draws on a number of talented musicians, recognized nationally as specialists in music of the Baroque, to create the best ensemble for the chosen repertoire.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542844900/mqgzeqea869xkngrryak.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; Where it goes</h3>
<p>The musicians and dancers are booked, the venue contracts signed, and rehearsals already underway for ""The Dancing Master"" shows. Your contribution will help us to pay the 11 artists fairly for their hard work in making this show a reality. </p>
<p>We are excited about this project, and hope we can inspire you to get excited too! We believe that experiencing baroque music and dance together greatly enriches the experience of both disciplines, and has a lasting effect on the audience and the artists alike.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>San Francisco Renaissance Dancers welcomes dancers of all sizes, colors, abilities, backgrounds and genders. Our dancers meet regularly to practice early dance technique and study the extant manuals published by dancing masters from the 15th through 18th centuries. Dancers also learn the art of deciphering the notations in these manuals and experience the exciting process of bringing an ancient dance to life. </p>
<p>Costumed performance with live musicians is a necessary part of fully understanding baroque dance. The baroque movement vocabulary is more deeply understood once the heavy and restrictive clothing is donned. And when the musicians start to play, improvising and reacting with and around the accents of the dance, a dancer can feel lifted and light, despite the costume.</p>
<p>Musicians are often surprised to learn that the baroque dance style is more lively than they would have thought. For baroque musicians to see the movements associated with a music form helps them to understand the way the music would have been played at the time. This leads to a performance of whimsical interplay between musician and dancer that would have been natural during the 18th century. </p>
<p>We hope that our striving for a deeper performance practice will enable audiences to feel transported to another time with us. We also hope that our work will inspire interest in early dance and that by inviting the audience to dance with us, they will understand that they are part of the early dance and music community, and not just observers.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542842723/onhspxrh1rfih3d5cahs.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is an ambitious project with a shoestring budget. We make our own costumes and borrow what we don’t have, and the artists are volunteering much of their time because they believe in what we’re doing. We seek volunteer ushers and ticket-takers, make our own programs and do our own administration. Countless hours are spent researching and reconstructing the dances, as well as finding appropriate music and creating the parts for the musicians. It is truly a labor of love.</p>
<p>We have experience producing concerts, so we know what’s involved. We have a detailed budget and know where every penny is going. We are aware it’s hard work but it’s also very fulfilling work. We are hoping concerts like this will help us in our mission to grow the baroque dance community in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>
<p>We have received a small Musical Grant from Intermusic SF for this project. We are so happy to have the support of the music community in what we are doing. But this only covers about 30% of the costs. Your donations here will help us pay our artists fairly, and may even help with the venue costs and our costume-making, too.</p>

</div></div>","The Project  
In the Bay Area there is a wonderfully diverse and vibrant contemporary dance community. However, a gap exists in the understanding of highly influential historical dance forms on the dance and music we enjoy today. We strive to make historical dance relevant for modern audiences, enticing our contemporaries to take a new look at the past.
Through performances of ""The Dancing Master"" we hope to revive an appreciation of baroque dance and its influence on music through time by offering two fun and fully-costumed one-hour performances of baroque dances as they influenced the music of J. S. Bach.
True reconstructions of 18th century dances are rarely seen in the Bay Area.  Connections will be sought between specific Bach compositions and 18th century dances. By performing them together we hope to transport audiences to a time when this collaboration between music and dance flourished.
Performances will be held in San Francisco and Berkeley, California in March of 2019
Before each performance, a 30-minute pre-concert talk will include an invitation for the audience to learn a simple Baroque social dance with us.
Dates and Venues
Saturday, March 2, 2019: St. Mark's Lutheran Church, San Francisco: 7:30p.m.
Sunday, March 3, 2019: St. Clement's Episcopal Church, Berkeley: 2:00p.m.

The Producers
Jennifer Meller formed San Francisco Renaissance Dancers (SFRD) in 2012 after she joined well-established early music choir San Francisco Renaissance Voices (SFRV) as a dancer in 2011. She was promoted to the role of Dance Director in 2012 and formed the SFRD company to specialize in recreations of early operas from Medieval, Renaissance, and Baroque eras. Since then, Jen has been choreographing, performing, and making costumes for productions with local early music ensembles including “The Play of Daniel”, ""Ordo Virtutum"", “Venus and Adonis”, and  “Dido and Aeneas”.
Vicki Melin (traverso) and Katherine Heater (harpsichord) formed Nash Baroque in 2013 and presents concerts for festivals and chamber series as well as benefits to fund children’s music education. Members of the group are professional musicians who have advanced performance degrees from the Royal Conservatory in The Hague, and the Sweelinck Conservatory of Amsterdam. Nash Baroque Ensemble draws on a number of talented musicians, recognized nationally as specialists in music of the Baroque, to create the best ensemble for the chosen repertoire.


What We Need & Where it goes
The musicians and dancers are booked, the venue contracts signed, and rehearsals already underway for ""The Dancing Master"" shows. Your contribution will help us to pay the 11 artists fairly for their hard work in making this show a reality. 
We are excited about this project, and hope we can inspire you to get excited too! We believe that experiencing baroque music and dance together greatly enriches the experience of both disciplines, and has a lasting effect on the audience and the artists alike.
 

The Impact
San Francisco Renaissance Dancers welcomes dancers of all sizes, colors, abilities, backgrounds and genders. Our dancers meet regularly to practice early dance technique and study the extant manuals published by dancing masters from the 15th through 18th centuries. Dancers also learn the art of deciphering the notations in these manuals and experience the exciting process of bringing an ancient dance to life. 
Costumed performance with live musicians is a necessary part of fully understanding baroque dance. The baroque movement vocabulary is more deeply understood once the heavy and restrictive clothing is donned. And when the musicians start to play, improvising and reacting with and around the accents of the dance, a dancer can feel lifted and light, despite the costume.
Musicians are often surprised to learn that the baroque dance style is more lively than they would have thought. For baroque musicians to see the movements associated with a music form helps them to understand the way the music would have been played at the time. This leads to a performance of whimsical interplay between musician and dancer that would have been natural during the 18th century. 
We hope that our striving for a deeper performance practice will enable audiences to feel transported to another time with us. We also hope that our work will inspire interest in early dance and that by inviting the audience to dance with us, they will understand that they are part of the early dance and music community, and not just observers.


Risks & Challenges
This is an ambitious project with a shoestring budget. We make our own costumes and borrow what we don’t have, and the artists are volunteering much of their time because they believe in what we’re doing. We seek volunteer ushers and ticket-takers, make our own programs and do our own administration. Countless hours are spent researching and reconstructing the dances, as well as finding appropriate music and creating the parts for the musicians. It is truly a labor of love.
We have experience producing concerts, so we know what’s involved. We have a detailed budget and know where every penny is going. We are aware it’s hard work but it’s also very fulfilling work. We are hoping concerts like this will help us in our mission to grow the baroque dance community in the San Francisco Bay Area.
We have received a small Musical Grant from Intermusic SF for this project. We are so happy to have the support of the music community in what we are doing. But this only covers about 30% of the costs. Your donations here will help us pay our artists fairly, and may even help with the venue costs and our costume-making, too.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Andrew Cannata, Matt Connely, and myself, Joey Banks, decided to start Haymaker Players here in Austin in order to provide strong, original, and personal content to a theatre community we grew up in. Our goal for the company is simple: we will never pay a dollar to license a production. This means that when you sit down to see one of our shows you will be seeing world premiere productions of brand new plays, musicals, and stories about our communities. We will present unique adaptations of public domain work (Shakespeare, Ibsen, etc) and create pieces that tell the histories of our neighborhoods. On top of all that, our goal will always be to hire locally and give opportunity to those in Austin looking to make a living as a working artist. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>It's pretty simple! It costs money to put up high-quality productions and it really matters for our first few shows as we seek to create a dedicated audience base. We have already reserved the theatre space for August, but we are looking for an additional $2,000 to pay designers/actors, offset production costs (costumes, set, rentals) and to pay for basic marketing pieces (posters, ads, etc). </p>
<p>We ask that you join us on this ride from the get go. If you are seeing this Indiegogo request, it's likely that you know one of us. Perhaps we've done a show together in the past or perhaps you've seen a show of ours. This is a chance to join with us in creating a new community in the Austin theatre scene and build something lasting. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand if you aren't at a place to contribute, but there are other ways to get involved! Come out and audition, do new play workshops, help build set, usher and work front of house, perhaps you have other connections that could assist us!</p>
<p>Simply email us: info@haymayplay.com</p>
<p>We can't wait to hear from you!</p>

What We Need & What You Get
The minimum funding we are asking for is $1,400. Here’s how we’re going to use it:
-This funding will allow us to compensate our composer and musicians for their work.
-Dynamic and professional images allow us to better market the production and our company as a whole. 
-Printing costs add up quickly. We would love to be able to print a program to showcase artists, thank supporters, and give context to the production. Programs are a valuable resource for students and audience members.
Perks include original poems, inclusion in our program, signed posters, performance shout-outs, rap-o-grams, dinner with the cast, and a guest-starring role in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” and others.

If we don’t reach our entire goal, we will focus on paying our musicians and composer with what funds we do receive. We will not hire a production photographer if we don’t have funds to pay them. We don’t ask anyone to work for free.  However, we believe that our productions costs are modest and achievable.

Bare Portland is Emboldened by the idea that stories can be told anywhere, we bring performances outside of the traditional theater walls and into notable spaces of Portland. Committed to accessibility, all performances are free or pay-what-you-can. Consistent support from the community and a track record of successful projects make us better able to expand our reach. Often, we are reaching audience members who have never seen live theater.

<h3>The Victory Theatre Center</h3>
<p>40 years ago, The Victory Theatre Center was founded and built by its Artistic Directors, Tom Ormeny and Maria Gobetti, and a group of dedicated theatre artists and student volunteers. In 1997, with the help of its board of directors, 21 years ago the property was purchased. The Victory’s history attests to its commitment to the education of new talent and the development of new work. Since 1980, the Victory Theatre has presented over 100 productions and about 100 dramaturgical workshops. Over 80% of these productions and workshops were of previously unproduced new plays. Many moved on to much larger venues. </p>
<p>The Victory Center Theatre is a small theatre, but what’s experienced here is large. Small space cultivates closeness; shared experience creates connection and community.

<p>    Η Ομάδα7 είναι η μόνη επιλεγμένη ελληνική συμμετοχή  στο Διεθνές Φεστιβάλ Θεάτρου της Στοκχόλμης για το 2019, με την παράσταση «Αντιγόνη, μια Ύβρις». Μια multimedia performance βασισμένη στην ομώνυμη τραγωδία του Σοφοκλή, σε νέα μετάφραση &amp; διασκευή. Ο πρώτος κύκλος  παραστάσεων πραγματοποιήθηκε στο Booze Cooperativa τον Νοέμβριο και Δεκέμβριο του 2018.  Δυστυχώς η σύμβαση με το Stockholm Fringe Festival δεν καλύπτει τα έξοδα μετάβασης και διαμονής στην Στοκχόλμη, των οποίων το ύψος δυσκολεύει ακόμη περισσότερο την αυτόνομη ύπαρξη της Ομάδας7, καθώς το σύνολο της παραγωγής καλύπτεται ήδη με δυσκολία από προσωπικούς πόρους.</p>
<p><strong>Omada7</strong> is the only selected Greek participation in the International Theater Festival in Stockholm in 2019, with the performance ""Antigone, a hubris"". A multimedia performance based on the  Sophocles' tragedy, in a new translation &amp; adaptation. The first round of performances took place at the Booze Cooperativa Athens, in November and December 2018. Unfortunately, the Stockholm Fringe Festival contract does not cover Stockholm's travel and accommodation costs, which make it even more difficult for Group 7 to stand alone as the whole production is already covered with difficulty from personal resources.</p>
<p><strong>Ο στόχος μας είναι 2600 ευρώ τα οποία θα καλύψουν:</strong></p>
<p>1. τα οδοιπορικά των μελών της Ομάδας7 (3 ηθοποιοί και 3 τεχνικοί, σύνολο 6 άτομα).</p>

<p><strong>Our goal is € 2600 to cover:</strong></p>

<p>2. the cost of our stay there.</p>

<p><strong>​Λίγα λόγια για την παράσταση «Αντιγόνη, μια Ύβρις»</strong></p>
<p><i>«…η Αντιγόνη του Σοφοκλή είναι μια κορυφή της δημοκρατικής πολιτικής σκέψης και στάσης, που αποκλείει και καταδικάζει το <strong>μόνος φρονείν</strong>, το οποίο αναγνωρίζει την έμφυτη ύβρη των ανθρώπων, και απαντά σε τούτη με τη φρόνηση»</i> <strong>Κορνήλιος Καστοριάδης</strong></p>
<p>Στο  κέντρο μίας σκηνικής εγκατάστασης με έντονη την παρουσία οπτικοακουστικών μέσων, τρεις γυναίκες ερμηνεύτριες μοιράζονται όλους τους ρόλους, παρεμβάλουν τις προσωπικές τους απόψεις και εμπειρίες και επεμβαίνουν στη σκηνική δράση. Σ’ αυτόν τον κλειστό κύκλο ενός σάπιου οικονομικού κέντρου εξουσίας τα δεκαπέντε πρόσωπα του Χορού μπορούν να φτάσουν μόνο διαμεσολαβημένα, μέσα από μια οθόνη, για να διαπραγματευτούν, να διεκδικήσουν ή να αρνηθούν τη δική τους ατομική ευθύνη.</p>
<p>Με όχημα τη σοφόκλεια τραγωδία, τις σκέψεις του Κορνήλιου Καστοριάδη και υλικά του θεάτρου της επινόησης, η <i>Ομάδα</i>7 ξαναδιαβάζει ένα κλασσικό έργο. Συνδιαλέγεται με την διαχρονική τραγικότητα αυτού του «δεινότερου» απ’ όλα τα πλάσματα, του Ανθρώπου και  θέτει ερωτήματα: είναι ηθικό χρέος του ανθρώπου να αντιστέκεται στην Ύβρη της  εξουσίας; Η αντίσταση μπορεί να γίνει ύβρις;  Είμαστε σε θέση να ακούσουμε πραγματικά την διαφορετική γνώμη, τον διαφορετικό άνθρωπο; Τι υπάρχει πριν τις αμετάκλητες αποφάσεις; Έχουμε δίκιο μόνο εμείς;</p>

<h3><strong>About the project</strong></h3>
<p><font><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">A couple of years ago I was given a birthday gift in a form of a Theatrical Clown class.  I was intrigued.  This class took me on an incredible journey into the world of </span>ridiculousness<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">,  pleasure, wonder, and vulnerability.  I ended up in Paris studying with the incredible Philippe Gaulier, where the idea for this project was born.  </span></font></p>
<p><font><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Throughout our lives we all go through various journeys and transformations, literal and figurative.  Each of these present various obstacles, challenges, rewards and more journeys.  </span></font>Clowns are simpletons, naive childlike versions of ourselves. They don't speak, don't know much, though sometimes think they do.  They're always faced with a dilemma but never phased by one. An immigrant is someone armed only with hope, someone who's ripped out of their life and stuck in a new country, city, culture, and in the process unwillingly becomes a clown.  We suspect everyone ends up in that situation at some point as we're all a bit of immigrants and clowns.  Hence we believe clowning is the perfect vehicle to tell this story. When it became unbearable to sit still on the idea, I invited fellow actors and clowns to celebrate, investigate and experiment together. </p>
<p>We have an amazing team headed by Aelita West who's no stranger to clowning, and has been performing in the acclaimed Slava's Snowshow for the last 18 years, and has also worked as an actor in Young Spectator's Theater in Moscow.  </p>
<p>We are now in the midst of the creation of the production which is set to premiere in February 2020 in New York!!!</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Putting up a full theater production is kind of a big endeavor, and we need all the help we could get.  You can play an instrumental part in making this a truly professional production.  Theater, costumes, stage design &amp; set, light and all that is theater magic entails a lot of effort and resources.  You can hop along on this ride with us by helping sponsor this project!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our goal is to create a dialogue, an encounter with our audience no matter where they stand in their journey, and explore together. Explore the relationship between the past and the present, explore the relationship of them back then and now. And the language we propose is - clowning.  Because what is a better way to answer some key identity exploratory questions? We emphasize the strength and importance of identity exploration and ""knowing your story"" in our work.  We hope that the mutual experience of the journey will resonate with the diverse NYC community and we invite you to become part of it. </p>

About the project
A couple of years ago I was given a birthday gift in a form of a Theatrical Clown class.  I was intrigued.  This class took me on an incredible journey into the world of ridiculousness,  pleasure, wonder, and vulnerability.  I ended up in Paris studying with the incredible Philippe Gaulier, where the idea for this project was born.

They don't speak, don't know much, though sometimes think they do.  They're always faced with a dilemma but never phased by one. An immigrant is someone armed only with hope, someone who's ripped out of their life and stuck in a new country, city, culture, and in the process unwillingly becomes a clown.  We suspect everyone ends up in that situation at some point as we're all a bit of immigrants and clowns.  Hence we believe clowning is the perfect vehicle to tell this story. When it became unbearable to sit still on the idea, I invited fellow actors and clowns to celebrate, investigate and experiment together. 
We have an amazing team headed by Aelita West who's no stranger to clowning, and has been performing in the acclaimed Slava's Snowshow for the last 18 years, and has also worked as an actor in Young Spectator's Theater in Moscow.  
We are now in the midst of the creation of the production which is set to premiere in February 2020 in New York!!!

 
What We Need 
Putting up a full theater production is kind of a big endeavor, and we need all the help we could get.  You can play an instrumental part in making this a truly professional production.  Theater, costumes, stage design & set, light and all that is theater magic entails a lot of effort and resources.  You can hop along on this ride with us by helping sponsor this project!
 

The Impact
Our goal is to create a dialogue, an encounter with our audience no matter where they stand in their journey, and explore together. Explore the relationship between the past and the present, explore the relationship of them back then and now. And the language we propose is - clowning.  Because what is a better way to answer some key identity exploratory questions? We emphasize the strength and importance of identity exploration and ""knowing your story"" in our work.  We hope that the mutual experience of the journey will resonate with the diverse NYC community and we invite you to become part of it.

<h2>HEATWAVE</h2>
<p>It’s August and the city is gripped by an unrelenting heatwave. Danny and Mia, an average lesbian couple think they know everything about each other. However, when Mia finds a prescription for testosterone in Danny’s jeans, it comes as a big surprise. How could she not have known Danny wants to transition? Or... did she? With the arrival of Danny’s disapproving mother and an unexpected visit from a straight co-worker, things quickly reach a boiling point. Fishbowl Theatre Collective is proud to present <i>HEATWAVE<i>,</i> </i>playing at Theatre Aquarius Studio as part of the 2018 Hamilton Fringe Festival from July 19 -29.</p>
</div><div>
<p>We are excited to bring Mia and Danny to the stage at Hamilton Fringe, but we need your help. Fringe Festivals work on profit sharing, which means all box office return is split among team members. But just to get the show to you, we have to cover the Fringe entry fee ($675), the cost of rehearsal space ($350), print and promotional materials ($275) and transportation for our actors ($200). We know times are tough and giving isn't easy, especially with so many other worthy projects asking for your attention. We want to offer you something to acknowledge our gratitude for your support.  When you donate to this campaign, we will send you collage art created by Erika Reesor, playwright and director of<i> HEATWAVE</i>. We have bookmarks and greeting cards, gift tags for Christmas presents (hey, we know how quickly it sneaks up on us), and larger pieces of art.</p>
<p>We believe that knowing people's stories, their challenges and triumphs will lead to a better understanding; more compassion for each other. We hope that audiences, both straight and queer, will leave more curious than they were before seeing the show. Good theatre doesn't give us ready-made solutions, but provides the jumping off point for more questions. Excerpts of<i> </i><i>HEATWAVE</i> were performed at <i>HamilTen Festival </i>and at Hamilton's first <i>Pride Theatre Showcase</i> this year. There, they were well-received by audiences and resulted in compelling discussions. We hope to carry on those conversations with folks after the show and at the Fringe Club. Theatre doesn't end when the curtain comes down, it lives in our hearts, souls and the conversations we have about it.</p>
<p>We hope you are able to help, but we know not everyone can. Even if you can't donate, please consider helping us by spreading the word about our show. Talk to your friends and co-workers about it, tell them why you believe this is a project worth supporting. Sharing our campaign and updates about the show helps tremendously and we appreciate all of your support!</p>

<p>I have recently been accepted to the 15th Annual Dance Under The Stars Choreography Festival in Palm Desert, California. I competed against over 100 applicants for a spot at the festival, and am now in the running to win the grand prize for my work, ""To Venture from the Norm."" I am competing in the Division II category with two members of Milwaukee Ballet's Studio Company, and, while I am extremely excited to expand my choreographic career, my dancers and I need money to get there.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My dancers and I need three round-trip tickets to Palm Desert, as well as money for three days worth of lodging and food while we are there. The grand total is around $1000. </p>

</div></div>","The Project
This December, Kucheza Ngoma Dance Company will be collaborating with award-winning playwright, Thomas Melonçon, to produce “Our Feet Can Tell a Story As We Celebrate The Legacy”. Combining a range of dance styles from traditional West African dance to Hip Hop, this show chronicles the saga of African-American history. Kucheza Ngoma was personally selected by Mr. Melonçon to produce this show. We are honored that our dance company has such an amazing opportunity to tell this story because producing “Our Feet Can Tell a Story…” is in line with Kucheza Ngoma’s mission to reach the youth of our community through dance.

Formally established in 2008, Kucheza Ngoma Dance Company has been dedicated to helping at-risk youth deal with issues of health and self-esteem by offering free dance classes as well as health seminars. Our wholistic approach deals with developing the minds and bodies of young people. We’ve had a tremendous impact on the young people that we’ve worked with. Producing this show will add another dimension to our work in the community.

We have a large fundraising goal for producing “Our Feet Can Tell a Story…”. The expected total cost is $7,600. I would greatly appreciate your help in reaching this target. Your gift of sponsorship is tax-deductable through our fiscal sponsor Fractured Atlas and will help cover the cost of costumes, theater rental, and marketing, among other things.
Thomas MelonçonThomas Melonçon has served as an Adjunct Professor in the Department of Communications, and recently taught in the Fine Arts Department of Texas Southern University. He also served as Resident Playwright at the High School for the Performing and Visual Arts from 1989 through 2002. He is the playwright of the award winning play, Diary of Black Men which is the longest running touring play in the history of black theatre. Eventhough this production was clearly set apart in terms of substance from other ""urban"" plays, it clearly is the pioneer of what is now called Urban Theater, setting the stage for the likes of Shelly Garrett, David E. Talbert and even Tyler Perry.Listen to an interview with Mr. Melonçon: http://www.blogtalkradio.com/letsbefrank/2009/08/04/lets-be-frank-interview-with-playwright-thomas-meloncon

About KNDC
KNDC has been established since 2008, a vital asset to the Houston community as a gateway for young girls and boys to express their creativity through a variety of dance styles: hip-hop, tap, modern, West Indian (Caribbean) folk dance, and traditional West Afrakan dance. Since obesity is a growing problem in Houston and many places in America, we also encourage our students to maintain healthy diets and to choose fruits and vegetables and drinking plenty of water. Since children learn by example our instructors are all vegan.


Artistic Directors


Zinnijah
Guadalupe is Kucheza Ngoma’s 26 years young artistic director.  She began dancing when she was 3 years old
and she learned by attending dance classes and rehearsals with her mother Ruth.  At a young age, she knew she wanted to have
her own dance company and help people explore the world through dance.


Leora Guadalupe is Kucheza Ngoma’s 22 years young assistant artistic director who has been
dancing since she was 3.  She loves to
perform modern and West African dance. 
Leora dances because it makes her feel free.  Leora would like to use her dance knowledge
to teach others and spread dance around the world.


Hannjah Guadalupe is 21 years young and is Kucheza Ngoma’s assistant artistic director. She has
been dancing since she was 3. She enjoys dancing hip-hop most of all because it
makes her feel free. She looks up to her older sister Zinnijah as her
inspiration and plans to contribute to the expansion of the dance company. She
also likes to play sports and is an animal whisperer.




We seek to preserve our Afrakan culture through dance.

<h3>THE GOAL</h3>
<p>We're raising completion funds for ETERNIDAY, a world premiere dance/theater piece by WR and Chuck Mee. We’re not starting from scratch – we’ve been working hard to earn the money to pay for this show. Teaching workshops in Australia, Norway, and Colorado, performing at NYC Summer Stage, and Dan choreographs shows outside the company (including Stravinsky’s Rite of Spring for the Philadelphia Orchestra with Ridge Theater). Through all of these gigs, money is put aside for future projects. As always happens, the future becomes the present, and that is now, and we’re asking for your help with the final stretch. We're $5000 short of our total budget.<br/> <br/>Sets, costumes, and lights all cost money, and, of utmost importance, performers and designers need to get paid a decent wage for their hard work! Love and devotion don’t cover the rent when you’re in rehearsal, or painting a wall, or editing a video, or building a sound cue, or devising a dance.<br/> <br/>We have performed our work in venues ranging from the Théâtre National de Chaillot in Paris, to the National Opera House in Cluj, Romania, to New York City Summer Stage, to the Bushwick Starr, deep in the heart of Brooklyn. The venues have ranged from very grand halls with marble staircases to raw spaces lovingly held together by duct tape. No matter where, no matter what, we give everything we have to make amazing work that will thrill you.<br/> <br/>Anything you can give (really, we mean it, ANYTHING) will help bring this exciting new show to life. If you have been inspired, delighted, provoked, confounded, or moved by a Witness Relocation production, we are asking you to donate at this time. If you would like to be inspired, delighted, provoked, confounded or moved by ETERNIDAY in April at La Mama, we are asking you to donate at this time. We try to make truly incredible shows, and we’re asking for your help.</p>
<h3>WHO WE ARE</h3>
<p>Witness Relocation formed in 2000 and is led by director/choreographer Dan Safer. The company is ensemble based and makes shows ranging from fully scripted plays to original, devised dance/theater pieces to many things in between.</p>
<p>Based in New York City, we have been recognized as one of the “ensembles who now lead the city’s progressive theater scene” (Village Voice), and are the recipients of three New York Innovative Theater Awards.</p>
<p>We perform frequently in dance and theater venues in the US and internationally. In NYC and across the US, these include La MaMa, Dance New Amsterdam, The Ontological, NYC Summer Stage, Dixon Place, CATCH!, CSV, The Ohio Theater, Dancespace Project, Solar One, American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, MA, Fuse Box in Austin, TX, Bumbershoot in Seattle, WA, Revolutions in Albequerque, NM, Fury Factory in San Francisco, CA, and Out of Hand in Atlanta, GA.</p>
<p>Internationally, we've done our shows in France at Theatre de Chaillot, Paris, Les Subsistances, Lyon, and Le Quartz, Brest; in Poland at the Manggha Museum, Krakow and the Silesian Dance Theater Festival, Bytom; in Russia at the Open Look Festival, St. Petersburg; in Romania at Man.in.Fest, Cluj-Napoca; in Canada at the Dancing On The Edge Festival in Vancouver, BC; and in Thailand at Patravadi Theater, Bangkok.</p>
<h3>WHAT WE'RE RAISING MONEY FOR</h3>
<p>“Eterniday”, a new evening-length dance and theater piece, is the second show in our ongoing collaboration with award winning writer Chuck Mee, premiering in April at the legendary La MaMa Theater in NYC, where Witness Relocation is proud to be a resident company. “Eterniday” is about all of human history happening in a 24 hour period, the random nature of life, and how amazing it is to fall in love. Our incredible company members – Nikki Calonge, Sean Donovan, Mike Mikos, Wil Petre  – will be joined by Kate Lee (all the way from Australia!), Javier Perez, Vanessa Koppel, and the inimitable Saori Tsukada, as well as acclaimed actor/director/writer Carey Harrison on film. We also have amazing designers on board – sets &amp; lights by Jay Ryan, original songs by Dave Malloy, projections by Kaz Phillips-Safer, sound design by Michael De Angelis, costumes &amp; props by Deb O, co-choreography by Sam Pinkleton, dramaturgy by David McGee, assistant direction by Ben Gullard, and direction and choreography by Dan Safer. We’re going all out on this one – caveman costumes, original films, intimate duets and huge dance numbers, and a beautiful, funny, epic, poetic script by Chuck.</p>

<p>Setting forth the strategic of my own campaign in Indiegogo, basic questions must be answered:</p>
<h3><strong><br/></strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Who I am - What I want - What my goal is </strong></h3>
<p>Eventually, I think that is not easy at all to answer in such questions!<br/>But let’s start from the beginning, or almost from the beginning!</p>
<h3><strong><br/></strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Who I am <br/></strong></h3>
<p>My name is Stella Serefoglou and I live in Athens for the last 15 years. <strong> </strong>Since<strong> </strong>2001 when I started my studies in directing, I work hard trying to improve my abilities in the field.</p>
<p>Producers’ assistant, second assistant director, continuity girl, first assistant director and, for the last 15 months, director. </p>
<p>When my second child was born in 2008, my life changed course. I started writing children stories and theatrical plays. I attended seminars and courses on drama in education and started teaching theatre games to preschool kids.</p>
<p>My play <strong>""My mum's great hug""</strong> is an attempt to answer on questions regarding the power of love, acceptance and unconditional support.</p>
<p><strong>This is parents' primary objective for me: holding their children into their lap, giving them all their love in order to make them strong and ready to face the world.</strong></p>
<p><strong>My mum's great hug"" is a story about a young mother and her 2 years old child being attached to her lap. Actually, it's a story about the power of the lap.</strong></p>
<h3><strong><br/></strong></h3>
<h3><strong>How it all started</strong></h3>
<div>
<strong></strong>As I’ve already told you, I’m a mother of two and an artist. My life changed when in our neighborhood moved in Daphne, a young and talented actress. She is a mother as well, so we had a lot in common! Almost immediately, I spoke to her about the show I had in mind.</div>
<p>After I talked to her about the style and the techniques I was planning to use, I found the rest of the collaborators –a whole different chapter I will unfold some other time- and we started rehearsals.</p>
<p>In this phase we are right now, we are rehearsing –in the studio or at our places, sometimes with our children! As I already told you…we won’t back down! </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Style, technique, impact</h3>
<p>Our play is inspired by the era of the silent movies and the films of Marx Brothers, Jerry Lewis and Jacques Tati. The action is mute and mimetic. Sound is produced by the actors' body movements, tap dancing and scat singing. Movement and flow is based on precision and rhythm.</p>
<p>The show is targeted to audiences of all ages. It's a theatrical play that parents and kids will definetely love! It's full of tenderness, humor, love.</p>
<p><strong>It's something that goes straight to the heart and soul!</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Our campaign's scope<br/></strong></h3>
<p>We expect to collect enough money to fulfill the production's basic requirements. The truth is, funding of art projects in Greece has always fallen short of generous and daring initiative. Current events in our country’s economy make things even harder for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>It's virtually impossible for young, creative artists to find enough resources to reach their goals. And yes, we believe that it is very important, even more so in our times, to be able to ensure support for artistic expression of any kind.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<h3>When will it go up?</h3>
<div>The show is scheduled to go up in October 2012 at the Michalis Kakoyannis Foundation in Athens.</div>
</div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>How you can help</h3>
<div>
<p>In this point, the easy part ends and the hard part begins…It’s called reality!</p>
<p>As you might know, in Greece it has always been difficult to ensure financing to make a short film or a full length movie, even to stage a performance.</p>
<p>So, we need some money in order to materialize our beautiful idea. We really need 15.000 dollars to cover the needs of our play, in order to pay every professional involved in the  project. </p>
<p>Deducting the money I would need in order to pay all my collaborators (actors, assistant director, lighter, art director, producer, teacher for the puppet) -who for the time being are helping me gratuitously-, deducting costs for transfers, cell phones and studio rental,  I set my campaigns’ goal to 5000 dollars.</p>
<p>In detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>$1000 for making the puppet</li>
<li>$2000 for props and costume</li>
<li>$1000 for the choreographer</li>
<li>$1000 for the musicians</li>
</ul>
<p>What do you think? Are you going to help so “My Mum’s Great Hug” becomes reality?</p>
<p><strong>I’ve put my heart and soul in this project, and the same goes for my collaborators who work for me with high spirits and devotion. <br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>I thank you so much for your time and attention. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Please share with others!</strong></p>

<p>In the last 10 years <strong>Contacting the World</strong> has <strong>enriched the lives of more than 1000 young people</strong> from<strong> 57 youth theatre companies</strong> in <strong>30 different countries</strong>.</p>
<p>Over eight months, young people from countries across the world collaborate online, learning and sharing with each other to create new shows which are then performed during the festival week. The festival provides an international platform and profile for theatre made by young people around the world.</p>
<p><strong>The impact this festival has on its participants is huge</strong>.  For some, it's the first time they've ever left their country, so Manchester is their first experience of the rest of the world.  I<strong>t helps young people build confidence; learn new skills, grow as artists and understand what it means to be a global citizen.</strong> It <strong>creates lifelong friendships and professional relationships</strong>; and <strong>promotes mutual understanding and respect</strong> between young people from different backgrounds, helping them to have a broader view of the world and how they can make a difference within it.</p>

A Message From Contact Young Actors Company

We’re Contact Young Actors Company (CYAC) from Manchester, UK.
This summer we’re hosting a brilliant international festival called Contacting The World that brings together young people from around the world for an amazing week of exchange and performance. 
Taking place from 9 - 15 July, the festival will be held here, in Manchester, with companies from Thailand, Nigeria, Trinidad and Tobago and the UK. We want to put on a fantastic festival to welcome them. To do that we need your help.
This is the first time that we've been involved in Contacting The World. We've heard loads of stories from young people who've taken part before about how much they learnt, the people they met and how it really changed their lives. Have a watch of our video to see what people who've been involved with the festival before have to say about it.
This will be a once in a life-time experience for us. Please help us share it with as many people as possible and put on a festival that Manchester can be proud of!
We are not only raising money for our show but to make sure we can give our guests from around the world all the support they need to stage their shows and have a great experience in Manchester. We are working hard with Contact to make this possible!
Sara and Steve (who you see in the video) are great examples of how this festival lives on. They are previous participants of CTW who are now supporting us as project managers and the creative team.
In return for your donation you can have us come and perform a show in your back garden if you like! Or just simply get your name and photo on our website. Check out our range of perks on the right...
We really appreciate all your help.
Thank you!
CYAC

The Impact

In the last 10 years Contacting the World has enriched the lives of more than 1000 young people from 57 youth theatre companies in 30 different countries.
Over eight months, young people from countries across the world collaborate online, learning and sharing with each other to create new shows which are then performed during the festival week. The festival provides an international platform and profile for theatre made by young people around the world.
The impact this festival has on its participants is huge.  For some, it's the first time they've ever left their country, so Manchester is their first experience of the rest of the world.  It helps young people build confidence; learn new skills, grow as artists and understand what it means to be a global citizen. It creates lifelong friendships and professional relationships; and promotes mutual understanding and respect between young people from different backgrounds, helping them to have a broader view of the world and how they can make a difference within it.


What We Need & What You Get

By donating to Contacting the World you will help cover the costs of accomodation, travel and food for the 100 performers, contribute to the production costs of the festival and pay for the development of CYAC's show including the creation of sets and costumes.
You can donate as little as $10 (That’s only about £6.29!) to become an Accomplice and see your name on our website, or as much as $1750 to become a Director and receive a bespoke workshop experience from our  Artistic Director, Baba Israel…

<p><br/>Hi. My name is Kaeley. The reason I am starting this campaign is because I am trying to raise money to help send my sister to a Zumba convention this year. She has been through so much this past year, yet never lost her faith in God and never stopped being the amazing woman she is. I will share with you a little about her and also what the Zumba convention is, in case you don't know.</p>
<p><br/><strong>About My Sister:</strong> <br/>Hope is originally from our hometown, Lafayette, Louisiana. In high school, she got saved and gave her life to Christ. She attended a Bible college called Master's Commission at our church. Shortly after that she moved to Houston to continue to serve God and follow Him where ever He led her. She was living her life for Him daily but knew she was made for more. She raised money and went on a mission trip to Waco, Texas where she lived with the homeless for a weekend. She immediately fell in love with the people and the place. She returned back to Houston and told God if He wants her to move to Waco then that's what will be. Well, just that thing happened. God called her to Waco, and not only did she fall in love with the city but she also met the love of her life, (now her husband) there! They both were so passionate about Christ and helping the less fortunate they immediately fell in love. Not long after, they got married only to find out their world was about to DRAMATICALLY change. They got approved to finance a home of their own in a part of town that is predominately poor and needs a lot of help.They were living out their dreams. Unfortunately, just a few months after ICE agents came knocking at their door taking away her precious husband, with no explanation. Her husband is a native of Singapore. He has been in America since childhood but as a young boy trying to fit in got into trouble. Well,  to explain it more shortly, when he did get into trouble it revoked his green card but no one told him. He went to rehab, willingly gave his life to Christ and became a completely different man. Five years later after his life was totally changed, they decided that it had fell through the cracks and now he needed to be deported. 11 long excruciating months for my sister, who was at Baylor University for Social Work and only doing Zumba classes for income, was now alone, with a note on a brand new home and her best friend and soul mate gone, but yet she never ever gave up on God, her husband, or the people in her community. She made t-shirts, bracelets, went to every court hearing, traveled hours every weekend just to see him through a glass, had rallies, spoke to every DA and lawyer, the list is endless. By God's grace, he was released and everything was dropped because lack of evidence. During that whole year, she never had time for herself but never once complained about it. She now is part of the DREAM ACT alliance and is using all of the information she received while Naz was detained to try to help others facing the same situations. You can actually read the whole story at <a href=""http://www.freenaz.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.freenaz.com</a> Her passion is children and every helpless person in this world. Pretty much God and all of His people and His world. She gives so freely of herself without ever expecting anything in return. She allowed myself and my son to come live with her and her husband after him just getting released just a few months before. She inspired me and reminded me of God's love and grace and completely helped me restore my life. I cant even begin to explain what an loving, caring, passionate and just beautiful woman she is, inside and out. I know one thing for sure, God looks upon her with delight!</p>
<p><br/><strong>In Conclusion:</strong><br/>If you took the time to read all of this. THANK YOU. If not, to get right to the point. My campaign is to try and help send my sister Hope to Zumba convention. Convention is a place where thousands of Zumba instructors come together and have tons of classes and so much informational material and also the creator of Zumba is present! It is  quite pricey and of course she doesn't have the funds for it. I just really think someone who gives so much of herself deserves one weekend doing something she loves. She is a Zumba instructor and does about 4 classes a day. She has helped so many women feel better about themselves and truly loves her job. I would be so thankful if you could please help me give her this gift that she would appreciate so much.</p>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>WHAT WE NEED:</strong></div>
<div>So: Im trying to raise atleast $2,000. The convention itself is $500.00. Then theres flight costs, food, and hotel and fees for the site. If we dont raise our entire goal atleast it is that much closer to helping her out. I plan to do carwashes and whatever else it takes. :)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I just feel that God has called me to help give her a gift that she so much deserves. She never spends money on herself but often does on helping others. Charities etc. Not to mention the living costs of myself and my son living in her home.</div>
<p><strong> Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Any amount helps, and we would appreciate it so much. If you cant contribute can you please atleast help get the word out for us? We dont have much time. She wasnt going to say anything about convention because she never thought she would be able to go. When I saw her watching the video and tears coming to her eyes i knew i needed to help.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I myself am a single mother so although we dont have any perks or anything to offer in return, I can say that your gift will be TRULY appreciated and God will bless it in many ways. Thank you so much for your time and consideration.</p></div>","Please Help Send My Sister To Convention!

<strong><strong><span>SUMMARY</span><br/></strong></strong>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Tapology, Inc. is a family based non-profit organization founded by Alfred Bruce Bradley in Flint, Michigan, as a way to inspire, educate, and provide opportunity for his students to learn and be trained by some the world's finest musicians, dancers, and historians. In 2001 the Tapology Tap Festival for Youth consisted of workshops for dance students and visiting schools, a luncheon, competition, and a concert performance featuring Savion Glover, Jimmy Slyde and Dianne Walker. The festival became an annual event featuring stage performers encompassing an age span of 90 years.  Performers included Arthur Duncan, Mable Lee, Jenni LeGon, Derick Grant, Jason Samuels, Dormeshia Sumbry Edwards, Nelida Tirado, Cartier Williams, Acia Gray, Germaine Ingram, Harold Cromer, Johnny O'Neil, Orrin Evans, Nick Rolfe, Mama Sol, and the late bassist Don Mayberry.  </strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>      We aim to serve youth who lack resources to pay for programs that will nurture their ability to dance while promoting excellence. We believe through education and exposure, tap dancing can help youth focus, work cooperatively with others, increase a healthy lifestyle, build self esteem, cultural pride and provide opportunity for economic growth. With the help of  incredible volunteers, board members, and amazing guest artist who share their knowledge and skills with the youth and community at large, we have served over 24,000.

<p>We are Off the Fence Theatre Company (OtF), a producing and touring theatre company based in Leicester. Formed in June 2011 we produced our first performance in December 2011 and, by July 2013 our seventeenth. At OtF we focus on new writing for stage and site specific pieces and have performed in an NCP car park, Leicester Castle, a coffee shop -  sometimes even theatres!</p>
<p>In March and April 2013 we turned an under-utilised room over The Western in Western Road into Leicester’s first pub theatre.  We built a stage, installed lights and a sound system, hired folding seats and created Upstairs at the Western, enabling 21 performers and 700 people to visit us. </p>
<p>With your help we now wish to turn the room into a permanent theatre space and improve facilities to an acceptable standard for both performers and audience. </p>

We are Off the Fence Theatre Company (OtF), a producing and touring theatre company based in Leicester. Formed in June 2011 we produced our first performance in December 2011 and, by July 2013 our seventeenth. At OtF we focus on new writing for stage and site specific pieces and have performed in an NCP car park, Leicester Castle, a coffee shop -  sometimes even theatres!
In March and April 2013 we turned an under-utilised room over The Western in Western Road into Leicester’s first pub theatre.  We built a stage, installed lights and a sound system, hired folding seats and created Upstairs at the Western, enabling 21 performers and 700 people to visit us. 
With your help we now wish to turn the room into a permanent theatre space and improve facilities to an acceptable standard for both performers and audience.

<p>We strongly believe that community cultural development is an important
aspect of developing humanistic approaches to community building, as well as
empowering and honouring the creativity of individuals at all levels.  We also believe that Community Theatre should
be given as much respect and effort as performances in the theatre. </p>
<p>After
more than a decade of engaging the community in exploring social issues through timely
and intimate works, <b><a href=""http://www.dramabox.org/eng/about_db.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Drama Box</a></b><i> </i>is ready to bring our works in the community to
the next level. </p>
<p><b>We are set
to build the 1<sup>st</sup> inflatable pop-up theatre “GoLi – The Moving
Theatre” </b><b>in Singapore! </b></p>
<p><b>It has
always been our dream to be able to reach out to more people with our work, and
elevate its artistic and aesthetical qualities so as to better engage with the
community.  “GoLi”, an iconic structure,
that not only complements our work but provides us with foundation to build our
works upon, does just that.  Our dream is
almost within reach.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>As with
all our work in the community, this dream can only be complete with you.  </b></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><b><br/></b></h3>
<h3><b>The beginning </b></h3>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/176788/files/20131105040213-px-haveyoueaten.jpg?1383652933"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em;""/><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>In 2001, we did our first performance <a href=""http://www.dramabox.org/eng/productions-liancancook.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">“Lian Can Cook”</a> at Toa Payoh housing estate. The play looks at the protagonist’s
relationship with her husband, son and her work place. It was a funny yet
poignant take on domestic violence and oppression through the style of street
theatre.  </p>
<p>Since then, community theatre has become an
important part of our programming. To date, we have produced more than 16 original
productions, mostly using the form of <i>Forum
Theatre</i>, reaching out to more than 55,000 people.  We have also worked with many organisations including:
Migrant Workers, Selarang Drug Rehabilitation Centre, <a href=""http://www.aware.org.sg/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">AWARE</a> Singapore, etc and explored many issues including AIDS, out-of-school
youths, ageing, racial tension and terrorism concerns, problem gambling, etc.</p>
<p>In 2010, our Associate Artistic Director, Koh Hui
Ling shared with her childhood friend Ting-Ting Zhang (Architect, Atelier Watt)
the kind of works Drama Box does in the community. They then talked about the
possibility of building a mobile structure that can  travel to different parts of Singapore, transforming
community spaces into vibrant places for arts and culture. Thus was “GoLi” conceived.
</p>
<p><i>[Forum Theatre </i><i>originated from <a href=""http://www.theatreoftheoppressed.org/en/index.php?nodeID=3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">“Theatre of the Oppressed” </a></i><i>established by Brazilian theatre master Augusto Boal. The
most distinct feature of Forum Theatre is that it turns passive spectators to
become proactive “spect-actors”, by allowing them onstage to replace actors and
change the outcome of a play. ]</i></p>
<p><i><br/></i></p>
<h3><b>Our Campaign</b></h3>
<blockquote>“It takes a place
to build a community and a community to build a place”</blockquote>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>*GoLi – The Moving Theatre </b>is a travelling theatre that’s going to be touring
Singapore. She will be a spectacle wherever she goes, activating the space she
inhabits, transforming it into an iconic and vibrant place for arts and
culture.  The basketball court in a
neighbourhood will become a drama theatre, the park will become an arts
carnival.  She will draw in crowds from
all over Singapore, the region and the world to participate in cultural
activities that not only entertain, but also engage and stimulate audiences
creatively, and provide a platform for dialogues over issues and for different
voices to be heard.  </p>
<p><i>[*Goli is also the name
of a traditional game popular in Singapore, a shared activity and memory of
many Singaporeans. With simple props – a set of goli (marbles) and a shallow
hole in the ground, a game starts.  A
game is spontaneous, right in front of homes, with neighbours and friends.]</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>However, to build
“Goli”, we need to raise S$400,000 by the end of 2014 and
we hope to raise at least US$50,000 from the online committee.  </b></p>
<p>It
is not the amount but the support that counts. Having the collective power of
the community, corporations and the government coming together to make this
dream come true is an integral part of this project.  This dream belongs to all of us.</p>
<p>Any amount of donation, no matter how big or small means a lot.<br/>Together we can build something special.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<h3><b>The Structure</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/176761/files/20131105033237-Copy_of_Aerial_01_FINAL2_warmer.jpg?1383651157"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><i>GoLi</i> will be
a set of four inflatable structures of varying sizes.  They will be cross-ventilated, light and easy
to set up.  Flexibility is factored into
the design where different combinations of the set can be assembled, allowing
the structures to appear independently, in groups of two, three or four.  This provides for multiple possibilities in
how they can be used to cater to the needs of the programmes.  They can be easily transported and stored so
that it is convenient to use on tours.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The mobility and adaptability of the
structures activates the different public spaces.  Outdoor spaces in the heartlands will be
transformed into a place for arts and culture, creating diversity in the town
and city centres.  The interesting
architecture design will also encourage and nurture community interest in
design, architecture and performance arts.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Performance Arts by tradition are held in static venues and are not
deemed part of the “everyday”, whereas street performances held in marquees and
tentages lack the aura and sense of place that theatre buildings provide.
Through <i>GoLi</i>, we seek to bridge the
gap between <i>mobility</i> &amp; <i>place</i>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><i>GoLi</i> is
projected to have a life-span of about 8 to 10 years, exciting and inspiring
Singapore for the next decade.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>The GoLi experience</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">With 13 years of experience in bringing theatre to the community in the
heartlands, <b></b><a href=""http://www.dramabox.org/eng/about_db.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Drama Box </a>forges forward with our mission to bring to the
people theatre that is fun and entertaining, aesthetically exciting, sincere
and intimate, while engaging and provoking the audiences to dialogue, respond,
reflect and participate.  We will
continue to bring to the people theatrical experiences that mirror our social
fabric.  We will also engage our
audiences with theatre that blurs the boundaries between the audience and
performers, as well as enable them to develop an appreciation of theatre as an
effective and affective language of engagement.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><i>GoLi</i> will
make its tour to the community every July from 2014, featuring programmes that
include theatre performances, installations, exhibitions, carnivals and
festivals. These will be co-created by artists as well as neighbours, for
everyone in the community to enjoy.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In July 2014, <i>GoLi</i> will be
making her first sneak appearance at <i>*Bukit
Ho Swee Housing Estate</i>, sharing stories of its residents and giving the
audiences a taste of life in this little neighbourhood.  Beginning in July 2015, <i>GoLi</i> will host a biennial Community Theatre Festival, the first in
Singapore, showcasing works from both local and overseas community theatre
practices, in the spirit of deep engagement and inter-connectedness.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><i>*Bukit Ho
Swee is a small housing estate in Singapore. In 1961, a major fire broke out in
Bukit Ho Swee and the recently constituted Housing and Development Board of
Singapore moved in quickly to construct low-cost public housing to house the residents,
and as a result, successfully curb the secret society activities in the area.</i></p>

<p></p><p>William &amp; Ting-Ting were lead designers at Zaha Hadid Architects, a
Pritzker prize winning design firm and have managed design teams in various
high-profile international projects. </p>
<p>They are experienced in performance venue design and creation of public
architecture and the public realm, having worked on numerous performance
venues. Projects include: Grand Theatres in Morocco (Rabat and Casablanca), National
Performance Arts Centre in Kaoshiung Taiwan (competition, 2nd prize), People’s
Conference Palace in Tripoli, Libya and opera houses in Middle East.</p>
<p>They are highly conversant and interested in advanced fabrication
techniques vis-à-vis digital design platforms and how these can be creatively
applied in the manufacturing process of conventional, everyday projects. </p>
<p>William and Ting-Ting were educated at Cornell University in
Architecture, modern political theory, film and philosophy. They also read
business at University of Oxford. Under the tutelage of Neil Leach and Chris
Perry’s Responsive Systems Group (RSG) their thesis project “Terminal Life”, an
omni-channel user-responsive airport system was first presented at the 2006
American Institute of Architects Dean's Roundtable exhibition and later at the
Beijing Architecture Biennale. </p>
<p>Both of them have an academic interest in political science, cultural
theories and semiotics, specifically how urbanism shapes the way society
behaves. Subsequently, they have published essays and lectured on urban and
socio-political issues at the Venice Biennale and universities such as ETH
(Zurich) and The Bauhaus. </p>
<p><b>Who are Watt </b></p>
<p>Atelier Watt is the think-tank of William and Ting-Ting. Borne out of
their passion for objects of crafts and luxury, Atelier Watt’s work traverses
design and art, referencing the beauteous past, mirroring the present and projecting
the hereafter. </p>
<p>Focusing on products, design-art, interiors and installations, they see
Atelier Watt as the main vassal for their design and artistic projects that are
not bounded by typologies, conventions nor trends - beyond the confinements of
‘form and function’. They wish to blend their ideas with traditional crafts and
cutting-edge technique, creating objects that appeal both to the intellect and
the emotion. </p>
<p>They envision The Goli Project as a blend of theatre
making and architecture- bringing to the public a creative use of social spaces
that provokes the imagination and participation of its inhabitants.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div>","""GoLi - The Moving Theatre""

that not only complements our work but provides us with foundation to build our
works upon, does just that.  Our dream is
almost within reach.

As with
all our work in the community, this dream can only be complete with you.  
 

The beginning 



In 2001, we did our first performance “Lian Can Cook” at Toa Payoh housing estate. The play looks at the protagonist’s
relationship with her husband, son and her work place. It was a funny yet
poignant take on domestic violence and oppression through the style of street
theatre.  
Since then, community theatre has become an
important part of our programming. To date, we have produced more than 16 original
productions, mostly using the form of Forum
Theatre, reaching out to more than 55,000 people.  We have also worked with many organisations including:
Migrant Workers, Selarang Drug Rehabilitation Centre, AWARE Singapore, etc and explored many issues including AIDS, out-of-school
youths, ageing, racial tension and terrorism concerns, problem gambling, etc.
In 2010, our Associate Artistic Director, Koh Hui
Ling shared with her childhood friend Ting-Ting Zhang (Architect, Atelier Watt)
the kind of works Drama Box does in the community. They then talked about the
possibility of building a mobile structure that can  travel to different parts of Singapore, transforming
community spaces into vibrant places for arts and culture. Thus was “GoLi” conceived.

[Forum Theatre originated from “Theatre of the Oppressed” established by Brazilian theatre master Augusto Boal. The
most distinct feature of Forum Theatre is that it turns passive spectators to
become proactive “spect-actors”, by allowing them onstage to replace actors and
change the outcome of a play. ]

Our Campaign
“It takes a place
to build a community and a community to build a place”
*GoLi – The Moving Theatre is a travelling theatre that’s going to be touring
Singapore. She will be a spectacle wherever she goes, activating the space she
inhabits, transforming it into an iconic and vibrant place for arts and
culture.  The basketball court in a
neighbourhood will become a drama theatre, the park will become an arts
carnival.  She will draw in crowds from
all over Singapore, the region and the world to participate in cultural
activities that not only entertain, but also engage and stimulate audiences
creatively, and provide a platform for dialogues over issues and for different
voices to be heard.  
[*Goli is also the name
of a traditional game popular in Singapore, a shared activity and memory of
many Singaporeans. With simple props – a set of goli (marbles) and a shallow
hole in the ground, a game starts.  A
game is spontaneous, right in front of homes, with neighbours and friends.]

However, to build
“Goli”, we need to raise S$400,000 by the end of 2014 and
we hope to raise at least US$50,000 from the online committee.  
It
is not the amount but the support that counts. Having the collective power of
the community, corporations and the government coming together to make this
dream come true is an integral part of this project.  This dream belongs to all of us.
Any amount of donation, no matter how big or small means a lot.Together we can build something special.


The Structure




GoLi will be
a set of four inflatable structures of varying sizes.  They will be cross-ventilated, light and easy
to set up.  Flexibility is factored into
the design where different combinations of the set can be assembled, allowing
the structures to appear independently, in groups of two, three or four.  This provides for multiple possibilities in
how they can be used to cater to the needs of the programmes.  They can be easily transported and stored so
that it is convenient to use on tours.
The mobility and adaptability of the
structures activates the different public spaces.  Outdoor spaces in the heartlands will be
transformed into a place for arts and culture, creating diversity in the town
and city centres.  The interesting
architecture design will also encourage and nurture community interest in
design, architecture and performance arts.
Performance Arts by tradition are held in static venues and are not
deemed part of the “everyday”, whereas street performances held in marquees and
tentages lack the aura and sense of place that theatre buildings provide.
Through GoLi, we seek to bridge the
gap between mobility & place.
GoLi is
projected to have a life-span of about 8 to 10 years, exciting and inspiring
Singapore for the next decade.


The GoLi experience

With 13 years of experience in bringing theatre to the community in the
heartlands, Drama Box forges forward with our mission to bring to the
people theatre that is fun and entertaining, aesthetically exciting, sincere
and intimate, while engaging and provoking the audiences to dialogue, respond,
reflect and participate.  We will
continue to bring to the people theatrical experiences that mirror our social
fabric.  We will also engage our
audiences with theatre that blurs the boundaries between the audience and
performers, as well as enable them to develop an appreciation of theatre as an
effective and affective language of engagement.
GoLi will
make its tour to the community every July from 2014, featuring programmes that
include theatre performances, installations, exhibitions, carnivals and
festivals. These will be co-created by artists as well as neighbours, for
everyone in the community to enjoy.  
In July 2014, GoLi will be
making her first sneak appearance at *Bukit
Ho Swee Housing Estate, sharing stories of its residents and giving the
audiences a taste of life in this little neighbourhood.  Beginning in July 2015, GoLi will host a biennial Community Theatre Festival, the first in
Singapore, showcasing works from both local and overseas community theatre
practices, in the spirit of deep engagement and inter-connectedness.
*Bukit Ho
Swee is a small housing estate in Singapore. In 1961, a major fire broke out in
Bukit Ho Swee and the recently constituted Housing and Development Board of
Singapore moved in quickly to construct low-cost public housing to house the residents,
and as a result, successfully curb the secret society activities in the area.

Koh Hui LingKok Heng Leun The Designers
William Tan &
Ting-Ting Zhang (Atelier Watt) 
William & Ting-Ting were lead designers at Zaha Hadid Architects, a
Pritzker prize winning design firm and have managed design teams in various
high-profile international projects. 
They are experienced in performance venue design and creation of public
architecture and the public realm, having worked on numerous performance
venues. Projects include: Grand Theatres in Morocco (Rabat and Casablanca), National
Performance Arts Centre in Kaoshiung Taiwan (competition, 2nd prize), People’s
Conference Palace in Tripoli, Libya and opera houses in Middle East.
They are highly conversant and interested in advanced fabrication
techniques vis-à-vis digital design platforms and how these can be creatively
applied in the manufacturing process of conventional, everyday projects. 
William and Ting-Ting were educated at Cornell University in
Architecture, modern political theory, film and philosophy. They also read
business at University of Oxford. Under the tutelage of Neil Leach and Chris
Perry’s Responsive Systems Group (RSG) their thesis project “Terminal Life”, an
omni-channel user-responsive airport system was first presented at the 2006
American Institute of Architects Dean's Roundtable exhibition and later at the
Beijing Architecture Biennale. 
Both of them have an academic interest in political science, cultural
theories and semiotics, specifically how urbanism shapes the way society
behaves. Subsequently, they have published essays and lectured on urban and
socio-political issues at the Venice Biennale and universities such as ETH
(Zurich) and The Bauhaus. 
Who are Watt 
Atelier Watt is the think-tank of William and Ting-Ting. Borne out of
their passion for objects of crafts and luxury, Atelier Watt’s work traverses
design and art, referencing the beauteous past, mirroring the present and projecting
the hereafter. 
Focusing on products, design-art, interiors and installations, they see
Atelier Watt as the main vassal for their design and artistic projects that are
not bounded by typologies, conventions nor trends - beyond the confinements of
‘form and function’. They wish to blend their ideas with traditional crafts and
cutting-edge technique, creating objects that appeal both to the intellect and
the emotion. 
They envision The Goli Project as a blend of theatre
making and architecture- bringing to the public a creative use of social spaces
that provokes the imagination and participation of its inhabitants.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div> <p><br/></p></div>","Hello, My name is Mary and I run Bellingham Dance Company Youth Competition Club.  This is a club for kids ages 12-19 yrs old and open to all levels of dancers.  These kids train in Swing, Latin and Ballroom dancing three times a week.  For some of them, this is the first introduction to dance they have ever had.  

I have been teaching for 19 years.  Teaching teens to social dance is one of the most rewarding things I do with my time.  The confidence I see blossom in these kids is tremendous.  Kids learn social skills, confidence, and partnership working as a team.  When kids set a goal and then are able to reach that goal, their joy and sense of accomplishment is infectious.
Many of these kids over the years and in this class are on scholarship (funded in house by us) and we are happy to continue this.  However, for this particular competition the funds are more than we can personally cover.   What We Need Seattle Star Ball (and other competitions) have fees for the competition to help them fund what they are offering :)  We have 9 kids from our classes heading to competition.  Your contribution will help cover this for the kids.  We will be paying their -
Competition fees per dance - $295 
Entry fees (and chaperon entry fees) - $1045
Hotel Costs - 600
Travel fee (auto fuel for our volunteer chaperons :) - $100
Total Costs = $2040.00
*So far we have raised $950 through our endeavors at the studio.  Each kid is expected to contribute something for the competition.
So we need to raise $1000.00 more  ** I know it says $1200 I just updated this section, and cannot change the amount we wish to raise via indiegogo :)  Thanks All

</p><h2>Cohesion
is about Baltimore's Artists</h2>
<p>Cohesion Theatre Company is currently Brad Norris and Alicia Stanley, along
with anyone who will come make collaborative work with them.  Brad is an
actor, director, lighting designer and professional theatre nerd who has been
working in the non-profit arts world in Chicago and Baltimore for over 15 years. 
Alicia is a graduate of St. John's College in Annapolis who has acted,
directed, and obsessively read her way into being a Shakespearean
fanatic.  Together they were the Directorial team behind the critically
acclaimed adaptation of Christopher Marlowe's <i>Edward II</i> at Spotlighter's
Theatre in the Spring of 2014.  Now they are using their powers for good.</p>
<p>Cohesion Theatre Company was born out of a desire to foster connections
amongst the theatrical and artistic community of Baltimore. We believe
passionately that when artists combine their talents and energies across
disciplines and despite competitive tendencies, what is created becomes greater
than the sum of its parts, and what would be a success for one becomes a
triumph for all.</p>
<p>We are currently putting together a three-show inaugural season in
Baltimore, Maryland that will include two Baltimore Premiere Productions.
 We are collaborating with established local theaters and artists to house
our productions for extended runs in the Fall, Spring, and Summer.</p>
<p>As Cohesion grows, we hope to partner with other grassroots theatre
companies in the Baltimore area to create new and interesting works of art. These
collaborations are central to our mission statement, and we hope they will help
foster the sense of community in the Baltimore theatre scene.</p>
<h2>We
want you to join us in our mission, and at our Launch Party!</h2>
<p>We will be announcing our three show season at our <b>Inaugural Season
Launch Party on Friday, September 26, 2014 - 8pm to Midnight at Gallery 788 in
Hampden - 3602 Hickory Avenue, Baltimore 21211.  </b></p>
<p>Tickets for the party are $20 each and will include food, drinks, raffle
prizes, and live music performances from <i>The Black &amp; White Milk Bar</i>,
featuring Dyana Neal, Jim Knost, Beth Weber, and Christine Thomas-O'Mealy, as
well as dancing with DJ Aurturo Ozaeta.</p>
<p>Tickets for our party are available online through this IndieGoGo Campaign!</p>
<h2>What
We Need &amp; What You Get.</h2>
<p>You can see the benefits related to each donation level on the right side of
the screen, but right now let's talk about what the community gets when you
give.</p>
<p><b>Your ticket purchase and donation mean that each of the artists involved
in Cohesion Theatre Company's Inaugural Season gets paid for their work.</b></p>
<p>Let's say that again.  This company is going to pay its actors,
designers, directors, stagehands, playwrights, stage managers, assistants, run
crew, graphic artists, and anyone else who does work with or for us.  We
believe strongly that art has value, and that the value of artists’ work should
be recognized.  We also believe that being fiscally responsible with the
art you make means that you can make more art in the future.  <b>These
ideas can work together.</b></p>
<p><b>Your donation to Cohesion Theatre Company will go into the pockets of local
Baltimore Artists so that they can live, work, and create in and for this city.</b></p>
<p>Here's how it works.  Cohesion is planning three shows this
season.  We'll start small by paying people stipends that are on par with
other local theatre companies who pay their artists.  That means that this
is the budget for our artist pay this year:</p>
<ul>
<li>30 Actors @ $200 each</li>
<li>3 Directors @ $400 each</li>
<li>3 Assistant Directors @ $200
     each</li>
<li>3 Stage Managers @ $500 each</li>
<li>3 Assistant Stage Managers @ $200 each</li>
<li>3 Lighting Designers @ $300
     each</li>
<li>3 Costume Designers @ $300
     each </li>
<li>2 Sound Designers @ $300 each</li>
<li>1 Puppetry Designer @ $300
     each</li>
<li>3 Set Designers @ $300 each</li>
<li>3 Prop Designers @ $300 each</li>
<li>6 Run Crew/Technicians @ $200
     each</li>
</ul><p>That comes out to $15,600 in artist pay, just for our three productions.</p>
<p><b><i>What happens if you don't raise all this money through this
campaign? </i> </b></p>
<p>We will rely more heavily on ticket sales from our three shows and grant and
sponsorship opportunities to find this money over the course of the
season.  We may need to cut production budgets in other areas.  We will not reduce the amount paid out to our
artists.</p>
<p><b><i>What happens if you raise tons more money than you need to meet this
goal?</i></b></p>
<p>We will put some of the excess towards our artist pay for our second season,
and the rest will go toward increasing the stipends for all our artists across
the board.</p>
<h3>A
Rising Tide Lifts All Boats</h3>
<p>As Baltimore artists, we work day jobs, we work night jobs, we work retail,
and restaurant, and minimum wage gigs all in support of what we really love to
do: Create.  Now sometimes that's for nothing, and sometimes it costs us,
and sometimes it costs us dearly.  We pay in time lost, we pay in gas
cost, we pay in nights spent up late learning lines when we need to
sleep.  That is worth something, and should be treated as such.  We
hope that through our connections and our collaborations we will be able be
able to offer that value to all theatre artists in Baltimore.  We hope to
work with other companies to find ways to partner with them and raise their
ability to support their artists more fully.  To create a vibrant and
supportive artistic theatre community in Baltimore that is about more than just
applause for its actors, directors, designers and technicians.</p>
<p>This is where we start that mission.  Will you join us?</p>

THE PROJECT</b><br/></p>
<p>This exciting new music
theatre piece explores the building of two bridges: the Roeblings’ bridge,
begun in 1869 and completed in 1883, and the poetic bridge of Hart Crane,
inspired, of course, by the former. 
Inspired by theatrical
greats including Bertolt Brecht and Robert Wilson, the piece is structured as a
collage, with short, French scenes leading up to bigger,  ironic song moments as Hart’s poem and
Emily’s bridge are built.  Musically,
the piece draws on both the jazz-infused ‘20s and the genteel Victorian
1880s.  The sound of the Chorus –
the Voice of the Bridge – runs the gamut from Vaudeville to contemporary
minimalism.</p>
<p>Matt Marks is a composer,
musician and performer based in Nottingham, England, who has worked with theatres
and theatre companies in the UK, USA, Australia, China and Europe, and is currently
associate artist with <b><i>Maison Foo</i></b> Theatre Company.   Liv Cummins is a lyricist/bookwriter
best known for the oft-produced <b><i>Vanishing Point</i></b>, recently translated
into Spanish and performed in Madrid, Spain.  Together,
they began their adventure fifteen years ago at NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts
Graduate Musical Theater Program.  <b><i>The Bridge </i></b>has had several developmental
readings and workshop productions, most recently at Russell Sage College for
Women in Troy, NY.  This workshop is the New York City premiere of the piece – in the shadow
of the Brooklyn Bridge.</p>
<p>In partnership with Brooklyn Historical Society, we
will present a workshop of <b><i>The Bridge</i></b> from October 15–October
17, 2014. We will be working with 10 principal actors and a 16-member chorus in
and around the beautiful BHS building at 128 Pierrepont Street.  This Indiegogo campaign supports our
goal to illuminate in this piece the relationship between art, infrastructure,
and history, showing how the examination of these elements together can lead to
exponential cultural understanding—as we showcase the work with an eye toward a
full production in celebration of the 50<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of the NYC
Landmarks Law in 2015.</p><p><b>CREATIVE TEAM</b></p><p><b></b></p><div>

<p>When walking
across the bridge, Matt and I were intrigued by the plaque on the Brooklyn
tower, which starts out: “Dedicated to the memory of Emily Warren Roebling…”  It goes on to name the other two
Roeblings – her father-in-law, John, mastermind of the project, and her husband
(John’s son), Washington – but it lists Emily’s name first.  Who was she, and how was a woman in
charge of engineering the Brooklyn Bridge in the very Victorian 1870s?</p>
<p>We
were further intrigued when our research kept pointing us to Hart Crane, ‘20s
poet, whose epic poem, “The Bridge,” was the accomplishment of his life.  Both Emily and Hart achieved the
greatest possible creative act – a literal bridge, and a figurative one – in
the same spot in Brooklyn, fifty years apart.  </p>
<p>In
one way, this is their story.  In another, of course, it is the story of all of us: we
belong to the Brooklyn Bridge, and it to us.  It connects us to people and places, to the past and the
future, to ourselves.  This is the story
we are telling.</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FIP1-YQEvwp8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DIP1-YQEvwp8&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FIP1-YQEvwp8%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>

<p><i>The Bridge</i> tells an important New York and,
especially, Brooklyn story: one of real people, immigrants – the workers, whose
blood, sweat, and sometimes lives were offered to lift those great, Gothic towers.  This is their story as much as Emily’s,
as much as Hart’s – and they must be acknowledged.  This piece shines a light on their work and their struggle,
delving down into the depths of the underground chambers, becoming ill with
‘Caisson Disease’ – known today as ‘the bends’ – as decompression forced many
to become bedridden for long stretches, including Washington Roebling himself
(Emily’s husband).  Many sustained
serious injury and paralysis.  Many
died from this frightening, then-unknown disease.  All suffered, yet continued digging out the caissons,
getting the work done.</p>
<p><b>Celebrating 50 Years of the New York City Landmarks
Preservation Law</b></p>
<p>We are partnering with the NYC Landmarks 50, an alliance of over two
hundred organizations and landmarks across the city engaging and informing the
public about the passage of the Landmarks Preservation Law on April 19, 1965.  From now through 2015, myriad cultural
and arts events engage the public about this important law and the need to
protect and preserve landmarks.</p>
<p>As the Brooklyn Bridge may be the greatest landmark in all of New
York (we’re not biased or anything!), our piece plays a key role in these
celebrations.  Specifically, this
Indiegogo campaign supports a workshop of <i>The
Bridge</i>, the first step in our goal to illuminate the relationship between
art, infrastructure, and history, showing how the examination of these elements
together can lead to exponential cultural understanding.</p>
<p>We plan to launch a full-scale production in late 2015 in
celebration of the 50<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of the NYC Landmarks Law.  Surrounding this production, we
envision immersive events throughout the city, involving thousands of citizens
and performers, engaging the public in an awareness and appreciation of the
Landmark Law, in general, and the Brooklyn Bridge, in particular.</p>
<p>With your help, we can launch this work which celebrates New York City’s past and present,
inspiring us to create the great, unimagined art and architecture which will
shape the future.</p><p><b></b></p>
<p><b>How can The Bridge make a difference, to you, to the world?</b></p>
<p><i>The Bridge</i> is a story of the workers who built it
under terrifying, unsafe conditions.</p>
<p><i>The Bridge</i> challenges contemporary ideas of gender
politics and female role models, and examines the role of an outsider
struggling to change the world while finding acceptance within it.  Questions emerge about art versus science,
beauty versus function, and the ways in which past, present, and future are
linked by bridges – both real and metaphorical. </p>
<p>But finally, <i>The Bridge</i> is
OUR story.  Yours and mine.  Because this great landmark – perhaps
New York’s greatest – belongs to all of us.  John Roebling’s inclusion in his architectural plans of a
pedestrian walkway allows us all – one hundred and thirty-one years later! – to
freely encounter it, touch it, be a part of it, whenever we wish. Through it,
we are connected to people and places, to the past and the future, to
ourselves.  </p>

It is a night of crowd merging with movie, where the fourth wall of the screen is broken, and the audience is connected by the rambunctious, gender-crossing joy and shock of a movie that is as much a film as it is an experience. The show will feature local performers dancing, acting, and singing along with the film, for an all immersive adventure.
Although largely ignored upon release, it soon gained notoriety as a midnight movie when audiences began participating with the film at the Waverly Theater in New York City in 1976. Audience members returned to the cinemas frequently and talked back to the screen and began dressing as the characters, spawning similar performance groups across the United States. Today, the film has a large international cult following and is one of the most well-known and financially successful midnight movies of all time.In this M.E.S.H.y embrace of the dirty cult classic, performers will add an edu-taining layer of integrated discussions about accountability, consent, sexuality, slut-shaming, and safer spaces!  This is the first screening of Rocky Horror with active participation in Portland since The Movies closed.  As Rocky Horror is still in limited release (nearly four decades after its premiere), we need to pay for rights to the film and for permissions.  We've got to raise $500 to make this happen, so we are in need of the community's support!You are encouraged, as audience members, to dress up, sing along, and shout call lines during the film.  Prop bags (including noisemakers, hats, squirt guns, etc) will be for sale at the event.Friday January 9th! Two screenings, complete with a shadow cast performance, at 8:00pm and 11:00pm. $10 advance, $12 at the door. Go to https://onelongfellowsquare.com/ to reserve your spot!

<h3></h3>
<p>Hello! </p>
<p>My name is Kat Marie Yoas. I’m a queer writer, performer, comedic healer, storyteller, candle maker, magic creator — a general working class sweetheart! </p>
<p>I have been writing (not so) quietly for ten years and creating sold out one woman shows for the last three years. I have made work locally and toured my work throughout the country and other countries with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister_Spit"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sister Spit</a> and with my own damn self! My performance and writing is audacious, bold, feminist and rooted in shame eradication. </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I have written a new one woman show that has been selected as part of the 2015 <a href=""http://qcc2.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">National Queer Arts Festival</a>! It is called A LESBIAN’S GUIDE TO SELF CARE.  (Sample video </span><a href=""https://youtu.be/wM2jGorNROM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"" target=""_blank"">here</a><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">!!!) It will be presented at </span><a href=""www.counterpulse.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"" target=""_blank"">CounterPULSE</a><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">June 5th</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">, 6th and 7th. I am beyond thrilled at the chance to perform at such a wonderful venue during such a great, historic festival.  Furthermore, I will finally be able to set the costs of my tickets, which are sliding scale and also no one turned away for lack of funds!  I welcome all my brothers and sisters &lt;3</span></p>
<p>A LESBIAN’S GUIDE TO SELF CARE is a comedic, astrologically drunken hero-journey.

</div><div><h3><br/></h3></div></div>","Hello! 
My name is Kat Marie Yoas. I’m a queer writer, performer, comedic healer, storyteller, candle maker, magic creator — a general working class sweetheart! 
I have been writing (not so) quietly for ten years and creating sold out one woman shows for the last three years. I have made work locally and toured my work throughout the country and other countries with Sister Spit and with my own damn self! My performance and writing is audacious, bold, feminist and rooted in shame eradication. 
I have written a new one woman show that has been selected as part of the 2015 National Queer Arts Festival! It is called A LESBIAN’S GUIDE TO SELF CARE.  (Sample video here!!!) It will be presented at CounterPULSE June 5th, 6th and 7th. I am beyond thrilled at the chance to perform at such a wonderful venue during such a great, historic festival.  Furthermore, I will finally be able to set the costs of my tickets, which are sliding scale and also no one turned away for lack of funds!  I welcome all my brothers and sisters <3

This is the first time in 10 years that PRIVATE LIVES will be produced in the

designers and other creative talents to help bring Cowardâ€™s clever comedy from
the page to the stage.<br/><br/><em><strong>Thatâ€™s where you come in...</strong> <br/></em>

Your generous contribution will go directly towards the production costs,
including: theatre rental, royalties, director, set design, light design, sound

advertising. <br/><br/>
We have set a goal of $10,000 for this campaign, but even that does not cover
all of the expenses weâ€™ll incur by opening day. Ticket sales will help
contribute to our bottom line once the play opens, but like most live theater
productions, theyâ€™ll only cover about 50 percent of our total cost. <br/><br/>

over.â€ â€œAll but continuous laughter.â€<br/><br/>
Those are just a few of the accolades heaped upon the original 1930 production
of PRIVATE LIVES, which follows the saga of perpetually dueling lovers Amanda
and Elyot, two divorcees who unwittingly book adjoining rooms while
honeymooning with their new spouses. They soon realize the folly of their new
marriages and impulsively flee together to Paris, only to be caught days later by their
jilted spouses. <br/><br/>
This stylish, savvy and still-timely comedy is loaded with pointed barbs about
modern romance that anyone can relate to. <br/><br/>
Written in 1930, the original 
production of Private Lives starred NoÃ«l Coward, Gertrude Lawrence, Adrianne
Allen and Laurence Olivier. The play has been revived many times on Broadway
(including a memorable 1983 production that starred Elizabeth Taylor and
Richard Burton), and has been produced in theaters throughout the world. <br/><br/>

<h3>My name is Fee King.  I'm the writer, producer and performer of:  ""Momma Was a Bad Mutha...Shut yo Mouth"". </h3>
<p> ""Honey..you haven't lived enough to write a 1-woman show"". So, I wrote MY 1-woman show</p>
<strong>Momma Was a BAD Mutha</strong>... <strong>Shut Yo Mouth</strong>is not only full of laughs, reminiscing and trash talking, but it sends a powerful message of hope filled with life lessons and coping skills for  young people in under privileged and disadvantaged communities.
<p>It's Real! Raw! It's True!  This is the story of young girl's untimely coming of age amidst her mother's weekend house parties.  The most happening house on the block.</p>
<h2><strong>Imagine:</strong></h2>
<p>.  Being pregnant at the age of 12</p>
<p>.  Being molested by your mother's boyfriend at the age of 12</p>
<p>.  Having an abortion at the age of 12</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If sharing my story...my TRUTH, can help another child from being a VICTIM of his/her circumstances or situation...then I must share this story.</p>
<p>Because of this show, the following happened in my life:</p>
<p>.  I healed  past traumas </p>
<p>.  I mended the tumultous relationship I had with my mother before she passed of cancer</p>
<p>.  I forgave the men who hurt, misrepresented themselves and violated me</p>
<p>.  I learned to <strong>forgive</strong> myself, l<strong>ove</strong> myself and others </p>
<p>.  I stopped living my life as a VICTIM</p>
<p>This show is in honor of my mother's life and death.  This show is the vehicle that I believe, with my Whole HEART, can help prevent &amp; bring awarness to:</p>
<p>.  Teen pregnancy epedemic</p>
<p>.  alarming high school drop out rates</p>
<p>.  dependents of alcoholism and drug addiction</p>
<p>.  Young girls and women chosing lifestyles based on what happened to them, early in life; as opposed to who they really are</p>
<p>.  plight of women trying to find their voice</p>
<p>*I want people to get mad and then move into action and do something ..get involved when  they hear about a young boy or girl who's been molested, sexually assaulted, raped and victimized*</p>
<p>I'm in ACTION; however, it takes a Village to raise a child.</p>

</div></div>","My name is Fee King.  I'm the writer, producer and performer of:  ""Momma Was a Bad Mutha...Shut yo Mouth"". 
 ""Honey..you haven't lived enough to write a 1-woman show"". So, I wrote MY 1-woman show
Momma Was a BAD Mutha... Shut Yo Mouthis not only full of laughs, reminiscing and trash talking, but it sends a powerful message of hope filled with life lessons and coping skills for  young people in under privileged and disadvantaged communities.
It's Real! Raw! It's True!  This is the story of young girl's untimely coming of age amidst her mother's weekend house parties.  The most happening house on the block.
Imagine:
.  Being pregnant at the age of 12
.  Being molested by your mother's boyfriend at the age of 12
.  Having an abortion at the age of 12
 
If sharing my story...my TRUTH, can help another child from being a VICTIM of his/her circumstances or situation...then I must share this story.
Because of this show, the following happened in my life:
.  I healed  past traumas 
.  I mended the tumultous relationship I had with my mother before she passed of cancer
.  I forgave the men who hurt, misrepresented themselves and violated me
.  I learned to forgive myself, love myself and others 
.  I stopped living my life as a VICTIM
This show is in honor of my mother's life and death.  This show is the vehicle that I believe, with my Whole HEART, can help prevent & bring awarness to:
.  Teen pregnancy epedemic
.  alarming high school drop out rates
.  dependents of alcoholism and drug addiction
.  Young girls and women chosing lifestyles based on what happened to them, early in life; as opposed to who they really are
.  plight of women trying to find their voice
*I want people to get mad and then move into action and do something ..get involved when  they hear about a young boy or girl who's been molested, sexually assaulted, raped and victimized*
I'm in ACTION; however, it takes a Village to raise a child.
 


What We Need & What You Get
We need a minimum of $9,600.00 for:

<p>Here at Broadway Wishes: NYC, we <strong><em>love</em></strong> theater. <strong><em>Love</em></strong> it. But we also love <strong><em>giving back</em></strong>. We combined our passions and designed a group that celebrates the art of giving.  </p>
<p class=""alignJustify"">Broadway Wishes was founded in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania by cancer survivor Lauren Buben. Diagnosed with Leukemia at the age of three, Lauren decided she needed to give back to her childhood community, the Make-A-Wish Foundation®. Together with forty of her friends, Lauren raised over $10,000 to fund six year-old Hannah’s wish to be in the ensemble of Broadway’s revival production of <span class=""italic"">Annie</span>. With the funds raised, Lauren and her team were even able to help a second child.</p>
<p><span class=""font_7"">Inspired by Lauren and our experience with her in Philadelphia, we were intrigued by the opportunities New York City had to offer Broadway Wishes. Founding a New York City chapter at New York University became the next step. </span></p>

a society.""       -  Rawan - Http://macaulay.cuny.edu  
""Is that it influences the way we think and feel
about our own lives and encourages us to take a hard look at ourselves, our
values, and our behavior.""    - Howard Shalwitz 
THERESA REBECK
Theresa is among a handful of modern day contemporary
playwrights cut in the same mold as many of the greats from the past like,
Tennessee Williams, Pinter, Strindburg, Arthur Miller, Sam Shepard, Eugene O'neill...
What
sets these writers apart is that they go beyond simply entertaining us. 
Their works examine the most pressing societal issues of the times in the hopes of inspiring a better tomorrow.  
SUNDAY
ON THE ROCKS is
important, challenging, relatable, and at the same time hilarious and
entertaining.
What We Need & What
You Get
This
is an easy one. We need money to build our sets, to pay the royalties for great plays like this one, for costumes, lights,
set pieces, props, and of course rent and utilities to keep our theatre sparkling for our loyal audience.
We strive to provide a memorable human experience for our
loyal audience.
THE COMPANY'S COMMITMENT

Dramatic live
theatre is a dying art form in LA and it is extremely important to our theatre company
members. If we can touch even one person with our work we feel as though we've
made a difference.
Over the course of eight years we feel as
though the stories we've told not only entertained our audiences but also left
them considering the most important social issues of our times.

The building is bigger than even we can take advantage of, but we’re going to take audiences through some unique, behind-the-scenes areas in this massive facility.</p>
<p>We’re pulling out all the stops for <strong>MANNA-HATA</strong>, but now we need that thing that always dogs us: more money.</p>
<p>To truly fill the massive post office space, we need to raise another $3,000 for the larger-than-usual artistic and technical team, and to cover the unique production materials and items that are needed for such a large venue: lighting for 3 floors, costumes for 20 actors playing over 100 characters, security guards for the historic space, even cleaning supplies for rooms that haven’t been occupied in years! And it’s coming up soon – June 7-23, 2013 – so we need your help NOW!</p>
<p>Another thing that is special about this project is that the post office is about to become a train station, the Daniel Patrick Moynihan Station. It’s going to take a few years, but this could be the last chance people have to see inside what was once the country’s largest postal facility.</p>

<p><em>Hatched</em> is loosely based on my personal experience as an egg donor in 2004. It was written and inspired by personal interviews with egg donors, donor children and recipient couples. </p>
<p>The purpose of this work is to give voice to an alternative sector of the growing sub-society of the infertility trade.

Egg donors are expected to be the silent partners in this medical industry. <em>Hatched</em> strives to give them a voice.</p>
<p align=""center""><strong>Alongside this theatrical creation, we are working to create a Toronto based donor support group and network.</strong></p>
<p><em>Hatched</em> was read at an informal partnership with George Brown College in 2010. Excerpts from the piece were also heard at Theatre Passe Muraille’s Buzz Festival. A second reading of the play and workshop occurred in April of 2012, which was extremely instrumental in finalizing the present draft of the script. The play has also been reviewed and edited by respected members of the arts community. </p>
<p>The playwright, Claire Burns, is a Toronto based actor and playwright. Her first play, <em>True North</em>, was short listed for Nightwood’s <em>Write from the Hip</em>.

<h3>Cause It's My Birthday</h3>
<p>My name is Dev Dugal.  Every year for my bday I fundraise for a social cause. This year, I'm raising money for a fabulous organization called Manav Sadhna based in India at the Gandhi Ashram.  This campaign serves as a kick starter for the 2012 North America Ekatva Tour.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>EKATVA</b></p>
<p>The <i>journey</i> of 16 children, </p>
<p>from the slums of Ahmedabad to the spirit of Oneness. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>And a <i>dance-drama show</i> that will touch the world.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact simply put is in the spirit of Oneness.  The tour occurred only once, 10 years ago.  It was quite an experience with individuals pushing in as we reached capacity to see/feel/hear and be ONE with the amazing children.<br/><br/></p>
<p>The tour is not cheap and the funds I'm raising will go towards securing a venue in Los Angeles for the 2012 show.  I'm also a part of the North America team to organize the multiple city tour.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need about $5,000 to secure a theater for the performance.  The money raised in this campaign will go to Manav Sadhna to use for the Los Angeles EKATVA show.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We are scoping out corporate sponsors to also MATCH the amount raised so if your company matches, please let us know ASAP.  Any amount doubled is extremely helpful.</p>

OR, IN OTHER WORDS:
 
Inspired by the bygone variety shows of
television’s Golden Age, Whiteman’s (pronounced
“Wit-Mans” and “it’s for everybody!”) is an honest homage to a forgotten era
while remaining a dark and sincere commentary on the roots of North American
comedy.
 
The Whiteman’s Whiskey Comedy Revue is at once an imaginative
musical revue, sketch comedy and absurdist drama that comes equipped with one
of Montreal’s finest jazz ensembles, the Buck Wheaton Trio.

can be a filthy, beautiful, ugly, wonderful, sickening thing and as irrational
and painful as it may sometimes be there are those who still find themselves

<p><b>Mingled Yarn</b> proudly presents the first ever UK revival of two studies of loneliness from the writer
of <b>The Killing of Sister George</b>.
</p>
<p><i>“Please don't die,” she kept repeating. I remember thinking: “How funny, whoever wants to die?”
</i></p>
<p>A bedridden blind man summons an ex-soldier to his apartment to spy on a woman from his past in
the flat opposite. In a Bayswater bedsit, a young woman examines her old diaries in an attempt to
make sense of a history of regret and mistakes.
</p>
<p><i>Let the pages remain clean and blank and unsullied. Only on the very last shall I write an
appropriate epitaph.
</i></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">From 29th September until 17th October, Mingled Yarn transforms The Hope Theatre into two
intimate bedchambers as they stage two haunting psychological studies of loneliness, <b>The Window</b>
and <b>Blank Pages</b>. From writer <b>Frank Marcus</b> whose plays were noted for their strong parts for
female actors, these productions will be directed by his granddaughter, <b>Rafaella Marcus</b>.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>Frank Marcus </b>was born in Breslau, Germany in 1928, and emigrated to England in 1939. He wrote more than 20 plays including <em>Notes On A Love Affair, Studies Of The Nude, The Formation Dancers </em>and his best-known work <em>The Killing of Sister George</em>. He won the Variety Award, the Evening Standard Award and Plays and Players Award for <em>The Killing of Sister George</em>, and critics lavished praise on it. As performed by Beryl Reid and Eileen Atkins, the play ran on Broadway for a total of 205 performances in 1966. It was later made into a Robert Aldrich film that starred Beryl Reid and Susannah York. As well as his own plays Frank made several translations and adaptations from his native German, including <em>La Ronde</em>, with his wife Jacqueline. He was theatre critic of the Sunday Telegraph for 10 years from 1968, and contributed regularly to magazines in Britain and America. He died in London in 1996.<br/></span></p>
<p><i>“Playwrights of Marcus's disposition and truthful quality cannot be had for love or money”
</i></p>
<p><b>The Independent
</b></p>
<p><i>“Enchanting: short, tart, and accomplished”</i> </p>
<p><b>The Spectator on The Window</b></p>

<p><b><br/></b></p>
<h3>The Company</h3>
<p>Mingled Yarn aims to
continue the tradition in which drama began by taking old stories and repurposing them for our
times. In exploring the oldest and most fundamental stories and plays, we have produced
renovations and re-imaginings of classical texts, new plays devised from old tales, and adaptations
of myths and books. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Artistic Director <b>Rafaella Marcus </b>trained in Theatre Directing at Birkbeck and is Associate Director of Prowl Theatre. She has directed at the St James, the Arcola, and the Oxford Playhouse, as well as spending a year as Resident Assistant Director at the Sheffield Crucible and assisting in the West End. Directing credits include <em>Sexual Perversity in Chicago</em> (Camden Fringe); <em>Ad Liberation</em> (St James Theatre Studio); Restoration (Arcola);<em> Harry The King</em> (Edinburgh Fringe); <em>Sonya and Andre</em>, a new piece devised from Chekhov (Sheffield Theatres); <em>The Two Gentlemen of Verona</em> (Brockley Jack Studio Theatre);<em> Laughing Boy</em> (Oxford House Chapel); <em>The Little Prince</em> (Oxford/Edinburgh Fringe/Arcola tour); <em>The Odyssey</em> (Oxford Playhouse). Assistant Director credits include <em>Romeo &amp; Juliet</em>; <em>The Window in the Willows</em> (both Chester Performs); <em>Boeing Boeing</em>; <em>Afterplay</em>;<em> Love Your Soldiers</em>;<em> The Winter’s Tale</em> (all Sheffield Theatres);<em> The Killing of Sister George</em> (West End).</p>
<p>Praise for previous work:
</p>
<p><i>“Outstanding ... storytelling at its best” </i></p>
<p><b>FringeReview on <i>Harry the King
</i></b></p>
<p><i>“Terrific...real atmosphere”</i></p>
<p><b>A Younger Theatre on <i>Laughing Boy </i></b></p>
<p><span><b><br/></b></span></p>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need...</h3> <p>In order to make the shows happen at the highest possible quality, we need to raise around £3000. Your money will be spent on:</p> <ul>
<li>Paying people! Mingled Yarn believes that artists should be paid for their work and has an ongoing commitment to budgeting fees before any other cost. In addition, The Hope Theatre has an in-house agreement with Equity that states that all actors and stage managers must be paid an agreed amount for the hours they put in. We are very pleased and proud to be able to uphold this commitment.</li>
<li>Design! We have a fantastic and talented design team with credits at the Royal Court, Sadler's Wells, Sherman Cymru, the Gate, Southwark Playhouse, and the National Youth Theatre among others. We have a very exciting design for the shows and need to be able to execute it well.</li>
<li>Marketing! As well as posters and flyers, we will be seeking to advertise the show online, both through banner advertisements and email blasts to mailing lists from whatsonstage etc. These methods have been proven to provide a bump in ticket sales but are very costly - we want to reach as many people as possible and get the word out.</li>
<li>Space! London is an expensive place to hire rehearsal rooms for a small company and we need to find enough to rehearse two plays over the course of a month.</li>
</ul>
<div><br/></div>
<div><h3>... &amp; What You Get</h3></div>
<div>We want you to view donating to us as an investment in the future of a group of talented individual artists and a great company. We recognise that any amount you give is extremely generous so we're offering a range of rewards and perks (on the right) but are open to suggestions as well! If you think we can offer you a service in return - advertising your business in our programme, one to one coaching on public speaking with our director or actors, sharing our skills, or even making you a lovely dinner - get in touch and let's have a conversation.</div>
<div>Even if we don't make it to our goal of £3000, all contributions will make a big difference to us. Your money will go directly into carpeting the theatre, providing the designer with enough pencils, or even ensuring that there's milk for the tea.</div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The theatre we want to make is honest, thrilling, accessible, inventive, and unites the best of the stories we already know with those yet to be told. At The Hope, we can offer you an intimate experience rediscovering the work of an important 20th century playwright for £14. That's already £226 less than tickets for <i>Elf the Musical</i>.</p>
<p>We're also so excited to be bringing Frank Marcus' work to the Hope for the first time, and reintroducing his exciting and varied work to a modern audience. We hope that this is the beginning of a rediscovery of Frank's beautiful writing.  </p>
<p>Our last project, <b>Harry the King</b>, couldn't have happened without crowdfunding, and led directly into the creation of this one through the people we met and relationships we formed while doing it. By contributing, you are helping us to make something great, both now and in the years to come.</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are producing two relatively unknown plays that we believe are as resonant and moving now as they were when first written, and we hope the audience loves them as much as we do. However, it means we have to work extra hard to sell them and convince audiences to take a gamble, which we will be doing through radio, web features, and social media.</p>
<p></p>Theatre is an expensive business and unexpected costs have a nasty tendency of cropping up. Although we as a team have a good track record of keeping costs low and finding innovative solutions, your support will help us to tackle those speed bumps head on. </div><div><br/></div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you're not able to contribute, you can still help!

Mingled Yarn proudly presents the first ever UK revival of two studies of loneliness from the writer
of The Killing of Sister George.

“Please don't die,” she kept repeating. I remember thinking: “How funny, whoever wants to die?”

A bedridden blind man summons an ex-soldier to his apartment to spy on a woman from his past in
the flat opposite. In a Bayswater bedsit, a young woman examines her old diaries in an attempt to
make sense of a history of regret and mistakes.

Let the pages remain clean and blank and unsullied. Only on the very last shall I write an
appropriate epitaph.

From 29th September until 17th October, Mingled Yarn transforms The Hope Theatre into two
intimate bedchambers as they stage two haunting psychological studies of loneliness, The Window
and Blank Pages. From writer Frank Marcus whose plays were noted for their strong parts for
female actors, these productions will be directed by his granddaughter, Rafaella Marcus.
Frank Marcus was born in Breslau, Germany in 1928, and emigrated to England in 1939. He wrote more than 20 plays including Notes On A Love Affair, Studies Of The Nude, The Formation Dancers and his best-known work The Killing of Sister George. He won the Variety Award, the Evening Standard Award and Plays and Players Award for The Killing of Sister George, and critics lavished praise on it. As performed by Beryl Reid and Eileen Atkins, the play ran on Broadway for a total of 205 performances in 1966. It was later made into a Robert Aldrich film that starred Beryl Reid and Susannah York. As well as his own plays Frank made several translations and adaptations from his native German, including La Ronde, with his wife Jacqueline. He was theatre critic of the Sunday Telegraph for 10 years from 1968, and contributed regularly to magazines in Britain and America. He died in London in 1996.
“Playwrights of Marcus's disposition and truthful quality cannot be had for love or money”

The Independent

“Enchanting: short, tart, and accomplished” 
The Spectator on The Window



The Company
Mingled Yarn aims to
continue the tradition in which drama began by taking old stories and repurposing them for our
times. In exploring the oldest and most fundamental stories and plays, we have produced
renovations and re-imaginings of classical texts, new plays devised from old tales, and adaptations
of myths and books. 

Artistic Director Rafaella Marcus trained in Theatre Directing at Birkbeck and is Associate Director of Prowl Theatre. She has directed at the St James, the Arcola, and the Oxford Playhouse, as well as spending a year as Resident Assistant Director at the Sheffield Crucible and assisting in the West End. Directing credits include Sexual Perversity in Chicago (Camden Fringe); Ad Liberation (St James Theatre Studio); Restoration (Arcola); Harry The King (Edinburgh Fringe); Sonya and Andre, a new piece devised from Chekhov (Sheffield Theatres); The Two Gentlemen of Verona (Brockley Jack Studio Theatre); Laughing Boy (Oxford House Chapel); The Little Prince (Oxford/Edinburgh Fringe/Arcola tour); The Odyssey (Oxford Playhouse). Assistant Director credits include Romeo & Juliet; The Window in the Willows (both Chester Performs); Boeing Boeing; Afterplay; Love Your Soldiers; The Winter’s Tale (all Sheffield Theatres); The Killing of Sister George (West End).
Praise for previous work:

“Outstanding ... storytelling at its best” 
FringeReview on Harry the King

“Terrific...real atmosphere”
A Younger Theatre on Laughing Boy 



   What We Need... In order to make the shows happen at the highest possible quality, we need to raise around £3000. Your money will be spent on: 
Paying people! Mingled Yarn believes that artists should be paid for their work and has an ongoing commitment to budgeting fees before any other cost. In addition, The Hope Theatre has an in-house agreement with Equity that states that all actors and stage managers must be paid an agreed amount for the hours they put in. We are very pleased and proud to be able to uphold this commitment.
Design! We have a fantastic and talented design team with credits at the Royal Court, Sadler's Wells, Sherman Cymru, the Gate, Southwark Playhouse, and the National Youth Theatre among others. We have a very exciting design for the shows and need to be able to execute it well.
Marketing! As well as posters and flyers, we will be seeking to advertise the show online, both through banner advertisements and email blasts to mailing lists from whatsonstage etc. These methods have been proven to provide a bump in ticket sales but are very costly - we want to reach as many people as possible and get the word out.
Space! London is an expensive place to hire rehearsal rooms for a small company and we need to find enough to rehearse two plays over the course of a month.


... & What You Get
We want you to view donating to us as an investment in the future of a group of talented individual artists and a great company. We recognise that any amount you give is extremely generous so we're offering a range of rewards and perks (on the right) but are open to suggestions as well! If you think we can offer you a service in return - advertising your business in our programme, one to one coaching on public speaking with our director or actors, sharing our skills, or even making you a lovely dinner - get in touch and let's have a conversation.
Even if we don't make it to our goal of £3000, all contributions will make a big difference to us. Your money will go directly into carpeting the theatre, providing the designer with enough pencils, or even ensuring that there's milk for the tea.
   The Impact The theatre we want to make is honest, thrilling, accessible, inventive, and unites the best of the stories we already know with those yet to be told. At The Hope, we can offer you an intimate experience rediscovering the work of an important 20th century playwright for £14. That's already £226 less than tickets for Elf the Musical.
We're also so excited to be bringing Frank Marcus' work to the Hope for the first time, and reintroducing his exciting and varied work to a modern audience. We hope that this is the beginning of a rediscovery of Frank's beautiful writing.  
Our last project, Harry the King, couldn't have happened without crowdfunding, and led directly into the creation of this one through the people we met and relationships we formed while doing it. By contributing, you are helping us to make something great, both now and in the years to come.
   Risks & Challenges
We are producing two relatively unknown plays that we believe are as resonant and moving now as they were when first written, and we hope the audience loves them as much as we do. However, it means we have to work extra hard to sell them and convince audiences to take a gamble, which we will be doing through radio, web features, and social media.
Theatre is an expensive business and unexpected costs have a nasty tendency of cropping up. Although we as a team have a good track record of keeping costs low and finding innovative solutions, your support will help us to tackle those speed bumps head on.   Other Ways You Can Help
If you're not able to contribute, you can still help! Get out there on Twitter with the hashtag #MarcusPlays and Facebook and make some noise about the crowdfunding campaign and the shows - and come and see them yourself. As theatre-makers, the most valuable thing we can ask for is that you come and see our work, enjoy it, and help us get better at what we do. 
   And that's about it. Many, many thanks from Mingled Yarn, and we wish you all the best.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Wild Women Theatre is an emerging theatre company comprised of some of the founding members of the performance ensemble The Saartjie Project which had its final production in 2012. This July we are coming back to the Capital Fringe Festival with our production, <em><strong>Four Women,</strong></em> directed by our own Farah Lawal.</p>
<p>There is no monolithic experience of black womanhood. Wild Women Theatre realizes that there are too few tales of black womanhood told by black women themselves. We are bombarded with images about our worth from the larger society, but rarely do we get to examine and display how we feel in our own bodies, words and voices. <strong><em>Four Women</em></strong><em> </em>is a performance for women (and men) that works to address that disparity through the lens of Nina Simone's song, ""Four Women.""</p>
<p>Though this work is a labor of love, we need your assistance to bring this production to its true stage capability. We believe in honoring the work of fellow artists and this fundraiser will assist with the paying of stipends to the various technical professionals who will work with us while also covering various production costs.</p>
<p>We are asking for $3,000 to cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>stage manager</li>
<li>lighting designer</li>
<li>light board operator</li>
<li>sound board operator</li>
<li>promotional material design and printing</li>
<li>photographer</li>
<li>videographer</li>
</ul><p>We are each deeply and personally committed to this work and are also contributing what we are able to individually. Now we are turning to you, our community of artists, creative architects, scholars, activists, and people who love black women (that should encompass just about everyone of y’all right?) to assist us.  We have some thank you gifts listed on the side to show our appreciation of your support.</p>
<p>No amount is too great or too small, but we are asking for donations to start at $5.</p>
<p>If you are not able to support us financially at this time, please help us spread the word and consider coming to one of our performances in July!</p>
