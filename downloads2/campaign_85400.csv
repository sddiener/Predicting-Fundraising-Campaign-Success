<p>Hello ladies, gentlefolk, music lovers &amp; chiptunerds across the world. My name is Richard 'Jay' Lewis, founder of the passionate chiptune music blog, <a href=""http://www.chipbitsid.blogspot.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">‘Chip! Bit! Sid!’</a></p><p></p><p>Before I start mouthing off about the project let me give you some context about Chip Bit Sid.</p><h3>The History</h3>
<p>
</p><p>I started Chip Bit Sid back in April 2015, a couple months after leaving Futurecop’s record label, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/wearethefuturex/?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">We Are The Future!</a> Whilst running the label, I found myself listening to chiptune music, often playing the likes of <a href=""https://protodome.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">‘PROTODOME’</a>,<a href=""https://sabrepulse.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">'Sabrepulse' </a>&amp;<a href=""https://soundcloud.com/anamanaguchi"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">‘Anamanaguchi’</a>. Through that time chiptune quickly became my number 1 music genre. However as I started to listen more frequently, I found that the community had very limited promotion, with many fantastic songs often going unheard. From realising this, I wanted to give the genre a push &amp; further help the community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So after getting myself organised, I set up Chip! Bit! Sid! and started off reviewing chiptune music every week. From there the blog began to grow and only got bigger when I joined GameFace.</p><div><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i0.wp.com/chiptuneswin.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/chipbitsid-e1449863297639.png?"" src="""" style=""""/></div><h3>The Birthday</h3>
<p>
</p><p>2015 has been amazing for not just the blog, but chiptune in general with artists everywhere releasing epic material, and even getting on Forbes! So obviously I wanted to aim on making 2016 even better!</p>
<p>Recently it occurred to me that Chip Bit Sid’s 1st birthday was coming up and after realising it, I had an idea: to set up a kickass chiptune night!</p><h3>The Event</h3><div>The event will be held on April 23rd (Saturday) at the <a href=""http://kingsarmssalford.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kings Arms, Salford</a> from 6pm-11pm.

<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>My name is Sergio Barer. I am a composer that started as a concert pianist but drifted toward composition in the 90s. A notable landmark for me was the release of a CD with my 2 piano concertos recorded in Europe in 2014. (You can see more details at <a href=""http://www.sergiobarer.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.sergiobarer.net</a>) In 2013 I met Terry and Theresa Danne and I started to work with the San Fernando Valley Master Chorale (<a href=""http://www.sfvmc.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.sfvmc.org</a>) in the creation of ""Moses, an Oratorio"".  Terry retired in 2015 but the SFVMC continued to work with me on this project and now we are less than 2 months away from the premiere.</p>
<p>My late mentor, Mario Feninger, told me a couple of years ago that all that has come before in my musical career was really leading to this project. And I think he was right. This project takes my musical talent and hard-won knowledge and channels it toward something bigger than myself, the story of the prophet that gave us the Torah and set the basis for Judaism and eventually for Christianity.  </p>
<p>Keeping my Judaism alive has always been important to me, and I think this work will have a role in keeping alive the Judaism of others, but while working with the SFVMC, I realized that the details of the Old Testament are not as well known to many Christians as they are to Jews and so this work helps inform them about their history and background. Let me give you an example. When Moses is at Mount Sinai, God reveals to him his 13 attributes. Jewish people repeat these attributes every Yom Kippur, but I haven't found many Christians that know them. And it is the same God we worship. So I think this is an important cultural work. It also aims to put you in Moses' shoes and to make you feel the story through its music, keeping it alive inside of you.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>The premiere will cost a minimum of $25,000. This includes 3,000 for soloists and choral preparation (does not include paying every choral singer or its conductor, which will only happen if we go beyond  this amount) $3,500 for the expenses incurred by Wilshire Blvd. Temple, $12,000 for the 23 instrumentalists in the San Fernando Valley Master Chorale Orchestra, which includes  three rehearsals, $1,000 for a piano rental,  $2,500 for fundraising expenses, $1,000 for programs and props, $2,000 for publicity.</li>
<li>There are additional expenses like the writing of the orchestral parts and future expenses of the choir which must be covered, like the rehearsal pianist fee, the rehearsal space, future publicity and future concerts. The campaign aims to raise $20,000. Ticket sales should cover the rest and put the San Fernando Valley Master Chorale with its new artistic director, Charlie Kim, on the road to serving the community with other interesting projects like this one.</li>
<li>What you can get, besides tickets for the event, is a signed copy of the program,   to be in a reception with the artists before the performance and some will get a pocket copy of the score and  priority seating for the premiere.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>

</div></div>","Intro
My name is Sergio Barer. I am a composer that started as a concert pianist but drifted toward composition in the 90s. A notable landmark for me was the release of a CD with my 2 piano concertos recorded in Europe in 2014. (You can see more details at www.sergiobarer.net) In 2013 I met Terry and Theresa Danne and I started to work with the San Fernando Valley Master Chorale (www.sfvmc.org) in the creation of ""Moses, an Oratorio"".  Terry retired in 2015 but the SFVMC continued to work with me on this project and now we are less than 2 months away from the premiere.
My late mentor, Mario Feninger, told me a couple of years ago that all that has come before in my musical career was really leading to this project. And I think he was right. This project takes my musical talent and hard-won knowledge and channels it toward something bigger than myself, the story of the prophet that gave us the Torah and set the basis for Judaism and eventually for Christianity.  
Keeping my Judaism alive has always been important to me, and I think this work will have a role in keeping alive the Judaism of others, but while working with the SFVMC, I realized that the details of the Old Testament are not as well known to many Christians as they are to Jews and so this work helps inform them about their history and background. Let me give you an example. When Moses is at Mount Sinai, God reveals to him his 13 attributes. Jewish people repeat these attributes every Yom Kippur, but I haven't found many Christians that know them. And it is the same God we worship. So I think this is an important cultural work. It also aims to put you in Moses' shoes and to make you feel the story through its music, keeping it alive inside of you.
 

What We Need & What You Get

The premiere will cost a minimum of $25,000. This includes 3,000 for soloists and choral preparation (does not include paying every choral singer or its conductor, which will only happen if we go beyond  this amount) $3,500 for the expenses incurred by Wilshire Blvd. Temple, $12,000 for the 23 instrumentalists in the San Fernando Valley Master Chorale Orchestra, which includes  three rehearsals, $1,000 for a piano rental,  $2,500 for fundraising expenses, $1,000 for programs and props, $2,000 for publicity.
There are additional expenses like the writing of the orchestral parts and future expenses of the choir which must be covered, like the rehearsal pianist fee, the rehearsal space, future publicity and future concerts. The campaign aims to raise $20,000. Ticket sales should cover the rest and put the San Fernando Valley Master Chorale with its new artistic director, Charlie Kim, on the road to serving the community with other interesting projects like this one.
What you can get, besides tickets for the event, is a signed copy of the program,   to be in a reception with the artists before the performance and some will get a pocket copy of the score and  priority seating for the premiere.


The Impact
The potential impact of the work is large because it can be a tool for the Jewish Community to keep its history, its traditions and its faith alive while it can bring, in the broader community, when performed in different venues, a greater understanding of the Jewish people and  of Christianty's Old Testament. The emphasis of this work in life affirming values will serve well anybody watching it and will be a positive influence in our culture.
 

Risks and Challenges
The challenge we face with this production is that it is written in a classical music idiom and there might be some difficulty in filling the hall because some people are not familiar with this type of work.   That's why we are asking some people to give more than others. There is also the factor that in order to give access to the premiere to as many people as possible in Los Angeles  we have  kept ticket prices low. $18 a ticket is barely more than what it takes to go to a movie these days, but it will not cover all expenses,

<h2><strong>The Palmdale High School Chamber Singers</strong></h2>
<p>   For the past 17 years, under the direction of Mr. Mike McCullough, the Palmdale High School Chamber Singers have earned a reputation for excellence throughout the state, the nation and even internationally. This year the Chamber Singers have earned the right to compete in the <strong>International Eisteddfod in Llangollen, Wales</strong> in July 2012.  This invitation comes to the group after their 3<sup>rd</sup> place finish in the same competition in the summer of 2004, their Gold Cup ranking in the Verona International Choral Competition in April 2006, as well as their 2<sup>nd</sup> Place finish in the Choir of the World Championship in 2008.</p>
<p>  The opportunity to compete and share music in the home of choral music is beyond description. As the 2012 PHS Chamber Singers, we are incredibly honored to be invited to the 2012 International Eisteddfod! Knowing that we will have the opportunity to be among some of the greatest choral groups of the world and having a chance to share and celebrate music with others is an excitement we cannot contain! This trip is not only our opportunity to travel beyond the Antelope Valley towards a world of new foods, languages, and cultures but also our chance to represent our own nation, the United States of America, and our community as we compete on an international scale. We are scheduled to perform not only in the Eisteddfod, but also in Holy Trinity, which is Shakespeare’s church in Stratford Upon Avon, and in the 1,000 year old Chester Cathedral.</p>
<p>   Just as we prepare musically everyday, we have also been preparing finically for our trip. In order to take on this journey each student must raise <strong>$3,000</strong> towards travel, room and board and competition fees. With 28 students, this means we are set on raising <strong>$84,000</strong>! Together, we have raised a significant amount of money towards this goal by performing paid gigs, organizing on campus fundraisers, writing sponsorship letters to local businesses, and even taking on part-time jobs. <strong>But we still need YOUR help!</strong></p>
<p>  Now, if the world operated on heart, soul and enthusiasm alone, we would be set, cups running over, with funds to spare! But, of course, getting to Wales and participating in this competition will take some monetary support from you: Our friends, families, community and sponsors. And here is how you can help:</p>
<h3><strong>Every Dollar Counts!</strong></h3>
<p>   Even if you can only spare a dollar, your sponsorship will be going towards making our dreams a reality! By donating to our campaign you are not only helping us get to Europe, but also earing some pretty cool SWAG for yourselves. Sponsors will be receiving gifts from us including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personalized thank you notes for the one and only 2012 PHS Chamber Singers! </li>
<li>A group photo of the Chamber Singers, perfect for spicing up any living room wall!</li>
<li>A CD full of our music for your listening pleasure!</li>
<li>A postcard sent from Europe so you can keep up with our crazy adventures!</li>
<li>A photo album so you can remember all of the magical moments we have on this trip! (It will be like you were there with us!)</li>
<li>A DVD of our performance in Wales, so you can cheer us on from your very own living room (the one with our group photo in it, of course.)</li>
<li>A FREE PEFROMACE by the internationally known PHS CHMABER SINGERS</li>
</ul>
<p>Honestly, we wish we could get half of these things! :)</p>
<h3><strong>Become a Supporter of the Arts</strong></h3>
<p>  As you may know, the demographic make up of our student population all but eliminates the possibility of the majority of the chamber singer’s families to be able to provide the necessary funding required to experience such an incredible life-changing experience such as this. Even with our work so far we could still use your sponsorship to make this trip possible for all 28 of us. This is a trip we want to make together, as a family. We are not only representing Palmdale High School and our community, but our country as well. </p>
<p>  As a sponsor of the PHS Chamber Singers you are not only helping us as a group but also as individuals; students who love music, yearn to share it with the world and hope to grow in our art. </p>
<h3><strong>Beyond the $$$</strong></h3>
<p>  Even if you are unable to support our campaign finically you can also become a sponsor by spreading the word. Your support, love and encouragement is one of the greatest gifts we can ask for! </p>

<div>
<h3><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Who We Are</span></h3>
<p>Hi there! We are Sharon Knight and Winter, nationally touring musicians in the Mythic-Celtic vein. We've been full-time musicians for about 6 years now, performing  as a duet or trio under the name Sharon Knight or Sharon Knight Trio, and are also the founding members of 6-piece rock band Pandemonaeon. We strive to bring community together here in the Bay Area by creating events that celebrate music, dance, the arts, myth, and imaginative costumery. If you are not yet familiar with us and you'd like to check out our music, you can do so at <a href=""http://www.sharonknight.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.sharonknight.net</a> and <a href=""http://www.pandemonaeon.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.pandemonaeon.net</a>. </p>
<h3><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>What We Are Doing</strong></span></h3>
<p>We are thrilled to have been invited to perform at the New Orleans Witch's Ball on October 27th. New Orleans is a fantastic music town, and one that we'd like to get known in. So of course we said yes. We've set up a few more shows while we're in town, and are planning to tour our way across the country. </p>
<p>The catch is - we don't yet have a following in the South. </p>
<p>So we've decided to document our travels and see if we can generate some tour support by creating our own ""Hunger Games"" style reality show of life on the road.</p>
<em><strong>We are going to make it as fun and engaging as we possibly can!</strong></em>
<p>We will post daily reports on <a href=""http://www.sharonknight.net/blog/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">our blog</a>, with video updates 2-3 times a week. In these videos and blog reports, we will endeavor to share the challenges, joys, and magic of life as a touring musician. We chose Hunger Games as our theme, somewhat tongue-in-cheek, because it seemed fitting. 14 hour drives, gas station food, leaky air mattresses - trying to stay alive as an independent musician really does feel like an epic battle at times! Might as well have fun with it!</p>
<p>As in the Hunger Games story, you can support our tour in the form of sponsorships, thus giving us an edge in the game. We intend for this to be a playful fun time for us all, as well as a way to keep us touring. And since the fundraiser will be going on while we are on tour, there is no concern that the project won't happen - it already is happening! </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Why We Need Your Help</span></h3>
<p><span>In better times, we have floated our outreach to new areas with credit cards, and have always been able to pay them off pretty quickly. However, our summer 2012 tour, while successful in terms of reaching new folks and playing some prestigious festivals, didn’t meet our financial expectations. So we are looking to new business models that will allow us to continue creating and performing our music.  And we need your help to make it happen.</span></p>
<p><span>Here’s a quick behind-the-scenes look at the budget for our upcoming month-long tour:</span></p>
<span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>EXPENSES:</strong></span>
</div>
<div><span><strong> </strong></span></div>
<div>
<span><strong><br/></strong></span><strong>GAS   $1200</strong><strong>   </strong> My, has this cost gone up since we started touring! We'll be logging about 6300 miles round trip this time out. Our little Yaris gets about 38 miles to the gallon. But still.</div>
<div>
<p><span><strong>FOOD $1800</strong></span><span><strong>   </strong>$60 per day for 30 days, to cover both of us. We try to be frugal, but we don’t do fast food.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>HOTELS - $</strong></span><span><strong>600</strong>  6 nights at $100 each. The rest of our lodging is either covered by the venue, provided by friends, or secured for free via <a href=""http://www.couchsurfing.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><strong>www.couchsurfing.org</strong></span></a>.  (Which is awesome, if you like to travel you really need to check it out). </span></p>
<p><span><strong>THE UNEXPECTED - $500 </strong></span><span>It happens. You get a flat. You need to change your oil. You need to pay ridiculous tolls, like on the Ohio turnpike. We find it wise just to have an emergency fund.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>CAMPAIGN-RELATED EXPENSES - $</strong></span><span><strong>750</strong> Indiegogo fees, shipping the posters, internet access, etc.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>EQUIPMENT - $500  </strong></span><span>We got ourselves a little GoPRo Hero to film our adventures on the road, which will not only serve us for this campaign but for filming future performances and creating music videos. We also have other equipment expenses, like power cables, batteries, etc.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>MUSICIAN SALARIES - $2500  </strong></span><span>This is what Winter and I pay ourselves for this work for the month. We use this money to do crazy stuff like pay our rent at home and cover our general living expenses.</span></p>

<h3><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong><em>So what if we come in over $4000?</em></strong></span></h3>
<p>$4000 keeps us in the black as we fulfill the year's final obligations. Anything beyond $4000 will go into a much needed equipment upgrade. New amps made in this century. A printer that prints. That sort of thing. Beyond that? My goodness - we could even pay to have some guest artists on our next recording! </p>

Kolorful is hard at work preparing his songs to be ready for a smooth &amp; faster studio experience but also doesn't want to rush the project.  (2) Perks!!!  We are going be ordering all the T-shirts/Crewnecks/Posters etc. just for our indiegogo supporters!  Any funds raised after studio time will go towards the costs of clothing perks &amp; the physical copies of the album. (3). Digital distribution &amp; promotion. We expect ideally studio time including mixing/mastering + cost of all the perks to bring us right around the $4,000 mark. If any month above &amp; beyond that is raised we will still be using it towards digital distribution costs &amp; promotions such as hip hop blog ad's, press releases, magazine, or if achievable radio. All of these things would help Kolorful spread his music to as  many people as possible for his message to be heard! #TEAMKOLOR! </div>

<p><b>Perk Prizes: </b>Album artwork will be released soon! Updates will be coming throughout the journey  of ""Sterling"" from ideas to release.  Audio samples, vlogs, &amp; more will be updated here as the album process is ongoing and finished.</p>

</div></div>","Kolorful's Story. & what is ""Sterling"" all about?
Sterling ""Kolorful"" Kalosky has only been creating music for a couple years now but throughout his entire process has kept confident in achieving his goals. Kolorful ""feels like hip hop is losing it's ""Kolor"" or art""  & is taking it upon himself to return those elements to the artform. He has done various projects under the sparkhop imprint in the last two years as well performed across various venues in the Detroit metropolitan area. With his newest project ""Sterling"" he attempts to bring fans closer to who he really is so that they may understand just who he is. A more personal but deep reaching album that may have a darker tone than his previous fun filled records. Kolorful has previously recorded the large majority of his music in home studio setups & wants to bring his music to next level sonically with a studio recording, mixing, & mastering process alongside his perfected raps. 




Kolorful has kept himself busy from a Sparkfest '11 performance last year in Pontiac, MI to opening for DEF JAM artist WAX, multiple local shows, & co-starring in the youtube sensation ""Songs In Real Life"" series by Steve Kardynal Kolorful has been on his grind attempting to bring his message & music to as many fans as possible. With indiegogo he hopes he can truly reach the next level & continue his mission to bring quality music to the fans well involving them as much as possible! 

""Sterling"" will be released shortly after the campaign has ended & an exact release date will be released before the campaign ends. 
Updates along the journey via vlogs, blogs, indiegogo updates, twitter, etc. will be popping up constantly along the way!
IMPACT?
""Sterling"" is an album that well it touches on a deeper more personal tone is oriented to be full of hope as well. Kolorful hopes to impact the listener to enjoy the music & inspires them to do bigger & better things in their life.  Kolorful looks to spread a message to ignore the hate & keep doing what you believe in.
It will directly impact Koloful who will get to fulfill a dream of being able to bring his fans an album of the highest possible quality well impacting those same fans by truly putting all he has into creating & developing it.All contributors will be impacted by getting to interact & help out & receive something for the greatly appreciated help.
What We Need & What You Get.
All monies received from campaign will go towards funding the various costs associated with recording & promoting the album ""Sterling"". Those cost include (1) Studio Time - This is the most expensive cost coming in at around $50 an hour. Kolorful is hard at work preparing his songs to be ready for a smooth & faster studio experience but also doesn't want to rush the project.  (2) Perks!!!  We are going be ordering all the T-shirts/Crewnecks/Posters etc. just for our indiegogo supporters!  Any funds raised after studio time will go towards the costs of clothing perks & the physical copies of the album.

Don't let 
their tattoos, piercings, and skinny jeans fool you. These 5 young guys 
have the cutting edge to where country music is headed. The band was 
formed in November of 2012. Leaving Austin consists of members: Austin 
Machado on lead vocals, Davis Forney on guitar and harmonies, Michael 
Stevens on bass, Terry Ashford on Lead Guitar and Keys, and Ryan Chin on 
drums. Born and raised in the central valley of California, growing up 
on country, pop, and rock n' roll, they decided it was time to get back 
to their roots and sing country their way, ""Cali Style"". </p>

	Living in the small towns of the Central Valley, everyone just seems
 to know everyone. Michael, Terry, and Davis grew up playing music at 
church together in Visalia, CA. One night Davis went to a local venue to
 watch one of his friends' band. When he walked in the room to check out
 the opening band, he heard Austin sing for the first time. Austin was then introduced to 
Davis that night through mutual friends and they hit it off immediately.
 They started writing music and became best friends within days. As they
 pursued music, Davis brought Michael and Terry onboard. As they played 
local shows, the guys heard Ryan's flawless drumming in their friends' 
pop punk band. It was a no-brainer to call him about their new endeavor in pop country. They all decided to get together for a practice session 
and it was immediately apparent that when Ryan started playing along 
with them, this was the dream team. 
<br/><br/>	In their first year, Leaving Austin has had the privilege of 
sharing the stage with some amazing musicians such as Joe Nichols, Randy
 Houser, Chris Cagle, James Otto, Parmalee, Love and Theft, Kelleigh Bannen and also doing pre-parties 
for Florida Georgia Line, Carrie Underwood, Hunter Hayes, Kenny Chesney,
 Eli Young Band, Kasey Musgraves, Jason Aldean, Jake Owen, Thomas Rhett,
 and George Strait, to name a few.  After being an emerging artist at 
Nashville's CMA festival in the summer of 2013 and being a part of 3 
weeks of the television series America's Got Talent season 8, the guys 
have hit the ground running.

With the help and generosity of KISS Country radio station, their 
community, family, friends, local bars, venues, and their quickly rising
 fan base, Leaving Austin is headed towards success and nothing is going
 to slow them down. Check out Leaving Austin on Facebook!<br/></div>","We are a Pop/Country band from California.

</div></div>","The musical ensemble, Advent Now!, has been assembled this fall 2014 to serve the Church and spread the gospel by performing Christmas music and sing-a-long Christmas carols in Japanese from December 9-24, 2014. The ensemble, a select group from the Lee University's School of Music, consists of a vocal sextet, two violinists, a clarinetist, a saxophonist, a cellist, a pianist, a bassist, and a percussionist. Although many Japanese seem to be fascinated with the trappings of Christmas (Santa, carols, Christmas trees, and so on), less than one percent of Japanese call themselves Christians. Through music, testimonies, and a spoken message, the group will present the good news of Jesus’ birth in Japan this December.

Goal: Raise $2,600 to cover trip expenses by Dec. 1

Pay for my entire expenses      $2,600

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Home Body is on the cusp of releasing our second full length album, <i>Spiritus</i>, and plan to embark on a national tour in support of the album. We're seeking the support of our fans to help kick start this new chapter! </p>
<p>Ruminating on darkness, the light, and all the tiny intangible shifts that add up to transformation and change, <i>Spiritus</i> is our most personal and expansive album yet. Three years in the making and totally self-produced, <i>Spiritus</i> captures the energy of our live performances paired with the emotional depth of our 13 year relationship. In the wake of so many cultural, social, environmental and political shifts over the past three years, as well as personal encounters with death, heartache, and magic, we used the recording process to really focus and channel our energy, tangles and all. Through slowing down the recording process we were able to dig deeper than ever before, questioning our assumptions and following our curiosity and delight as far as possible. In that creative spaciousness we've crafted eight dynamic songs lush with character and detail, displaying moments of ecstatic high energy melting into soft expansion, coaxed along by ghostly textured synths, momentum mounting, spirit settling. </p>
<p>We recorded a bulk of the instruments and backing vocals at home in our 'sparkle room', and worked with a handful of wonderful engineers on tracking lead vocals, mixing, and mastering - James Zaner (Sound Shuttle Studio), Justin Pizzoferrato (Sonelab), Andrew Oedel (Ghost Hit Recoding), and Sarah Register. We're so dang proud of how it turned out! We're honored to be working with two labels - Peace+Rhythm and Feeding Tube Records - to make <i>Spiritus</i> available on vinyl record, CD, cassette, and digitally. It will be available everywhere April 26, 2019. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise $8,000. These funds will greatly help sustain and amplify our creative efforts through offsetting production and publicity costs, as well as helping with equipment repair and upgrades before we embark on a rigorous tour in support of the album's release. Though this album's expenses actually exceed $8,000, we hope to supplement it's cost with income from our performances, album pre-sales, and funds from our part-time jobs. </p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">$5,000 (tracking, mixing, and mastering costs)</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">$3,000 (hiring a publicist to maximize press, digital traction, and exposure)</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">$1,500 (equipment repair and upgrading our cables, flight cases, stands, and lighting)</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">$1,000+ (miscellaneous, ie. music videos, new merchandise, in-ear monitors, AAA membership, performance organization and subscription service fees, stage outfits, rent while we're on tour, etc)</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">$400 (indie go go's cut is 5% of whatever we raise)</li>
</ul>
<p>After careful consideration of all our financial options (ie. loan from bank, credit card, taking on more shifts at our day jobs), we decided to go with a model of fundraising that was most in line with our vision of success. This fan-to-band model of direct social capital isn't just a way for us to buy new supplies, but it can also be an opportunity to deepen our connections with those around us and continue the energetic cycle of exchange. Mutually beneficial, this capital campaign is a way to get more from Home Body, sooner, and more meaningfully. We feel extremely privileged to be artists, and we take our craft seriously.  We truly believe in the power of our music, and in the face of so many shitty things happening in the world, we feel even more compelled to give this next chapter of Home Body all we've got! </p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, it'll affect the scope &amp; scale of Spiritus' release - we may not be able to tour as widely, <i>Spiritus</i> might not reach as many ears, and we'll be in a more vulnerable financial position. We're extremely grateful for any contributions we receive, however, and recognize that not everyone who supports us has money to spare! We love you anyway! </p>
<p>We have many unique perks to offer to contributors, both physical (like advance copies of the new album, signed posters, postcard packs, art prints, and new merchandise) and experiential options (like customized phone greetings, personal performances, guest list privileges, mail from the road, or an afternoon of treasure hunting &amp; thrifting with Haley!). </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Over the past 8 years, we have performed close to 400 shows across North America, and have released our debut full length <i>In Real Life</i> (Feeding Tube Records, 2013), a 7"" called <i>Traps</i> (Tiny Radars, 2013), an EP <i>Guts</i> (self release, 2014), and an improvisational art project called <i>FORMS</i> (digital self release, 2018). We've also scored fashion shows and dance performances, made music for film &amp; commercial, and have led performance workshops for youth and differently-abled adults. In addition to writing and performing all our own material, we also handle all our own booking, graphic design, merchandising, and even control our own light show. Dedicated to our vision and employing a strong work ethic, we are grateful for the opportunities and lessons Home Body has manifested so far. We feel extremely optimistic about our next chapter, emboldened by the support of our vast network of friends, family, and fans. </p>
<p>In many ways, ""making it"" in the music industry feels like a myth, because we are constantly making ""It!"" We both live and breathe Home Body. We love creating music together and don't expect to stop, ever. Already feeling successful and satiated by this project and the opportunities and connections we've made through it, we are excited by the mystery of what could come next. We're humbled and grateful for the support of our fans over the past eight years and feel honored and privileged to do what we do. </p>
<p>Now more than ever, we believe in the power of music to bring people together. We've witnessed first hand how playfulness and presence can foster empathy, animate intuition, offer possibility, and spark transformation. In response to this quickly changing and often harsh world we share, we offer <i>Spiritus</i> as an auditory balm.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and attention and would be honored for your support in this next chapter with <i>Spiritus</i>! </p>

<h3>About the ""Where We Find Ourselves"" Virtual Choir</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Hello! I’m composer Michael Bussewitz-Quarm. I write choral music that engages singers and audiences with the leading social issues of our time. I’d love for you to join me in a virtual choir for my latest piece, Where We Find Ourselves.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1599340477/kateqtjjln3a5nsgbill.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Where We Find Ourselves is inspired by an exhibit and book of the same name, which feature the portraits of Hugh Mangum, a photographer who lived in Durham, North Carolina during the Jim Crow era. He is unique in that he photographed people of diverse racial and economic backgrounds and was incredibly sensitive to the details in the portraits: the clothing, hair, expression, and physicality he captured truly represent humanity’s richness. It is significant that his work reflects racial diversity during a time of violent segregation. As Margaret Sartor, on of the curators and authors of the book, Where We Find Ourselves, observes, his portraits “indicate that an unbiased and open-door policy existed in his studio.”</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1599340513/hvj1wmyvrqkxs8w6nw4p.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>These portraits are from a set of glass plate negatives that were found years after Mangum’s death in a family barn. Over time, these negatives were damaged and so the photographs developed signs of wear and some distortions—all of which add to the richness of experiencing them as we consider the passage of time and the gaps between what we think we know about a person based on their appearance and who they truly are.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1599340366/dm3otgpg3pah9ofl4ozu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>This project begins this fall with a series of video “journeys” that explore the themes in the portraits, the history of this era, and the music and lyrics as they are being written. These journeys will be hosted by me, lyricist Chantal Sellers, photographers, curators, and authors of the book Where We Find Ourselves, Margaret Sartor and Alex Harris, as well as Dr. Sherry Boyd, Humanities Coordinator for Dallas College, and Tina Sayers, Executive Director of Maple Seed Creative Consulting.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1599340552/fugg5mxwrzfupd0vcczn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>All virtual choir members will be invited to join a private Facebook group hosted by me so that you can meet one another, share your thoughts and observations, and build community with your fellow singers. In this way, we begin our artistic journey with introspection and discussion, to deepen our understanding and open our minds and hearts to the topics we will be singing about.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1599340400/bxoox0gt4bgv60ikj9ka.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Where We Find Ourselves will be 20-22 minutes long, in five movements, for SATB choir.  The work will be of medium difficulty, with original lyrics written by Chantal Sellers. The music will be released in January, 2021, along with rehearsal tracks for you to use to practice and record your part. I will host recorded virtual “rehearsals” with each section to share my vision for phrasing, shaping, and overall musical ideas. These rehearsals will be recorded for those who will be preparing their part on their own. </p>
<p>In addition, you may join at the Premium Virtual Choir Member level and receive a one-on-one musical coaching with me. The final video will be edited together in the spring of 2021 and delivered to you and shared online so that the message can spread and grow!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The message of these photographs, that we must look and listen deeper to one another, and that while much time has passed, our country still has so much work to do to overcome racism, is timely and urgent. As we look around at our country and our world, it is easy to get overwhelmed by the many challenges we see. It’s important to know that we can make a difference by educating ourselves and using our talents to inform and inspire others.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In addition, many of us who have found a home in choral music are missing our usual outlet for singing during the pandemic. Our weekly rehearsal routine has been disrupted to keep our communities safe. But we still need community, we still need purpose and a way to channel our artistic talents for our own happiness and to serve others. This project will have an immense impact on our lives and on the world as we come together in the journeys this fall and in song in the spring.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I truly believe we can change the world through the power of music. Choral music is the perfect medium to raise awareness, engage ourselves and our community in dialogue, inspire compassion, and incite meaningful change. I hope you will open your hearts and raise your voice with me to create this new piece of music.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I am committed to writing this piece, hosting the video journeys, and creating the virtual choir video. I am an experienced composer and conductor with an extensive background in writing music, running rehearsals, and bringing a performance project to fruition. </p>
<p>One of the great things about a virtual choir is that it can work with a large, medium, or small group of singers. Because everyone will have access to the rehearsal tracks, I expect a high quality performance no matter the number of singers. I would love to have a large four-part chorus for this project, but the piece will work beautifully with a smaller ensemble if necessary. </p>
<p>If my financial goal is not reached, all commitments listed in the “perks” will be honored, the video journeys will go live, and the virtual choir video will still be created. In this way, I and my business are absorbing the risk of this project. There is no risk to donors. </p>

<p>Johnny Cash built a cabin in Hendersonville, TN in 1978. It was then, as it is now, a place to find solace and make music. The Cash Cabin Studio hosts an astounding history. Not only did Johnny and June Carter Cash record most all of their later music here, but many other talented musicians and famous entertainers have made music within the cabin. It is a dream come true to humbly join the ranks of my heroes who have recorded between these legendary walls.</p>
<p>To have John Jackson (The Jayhawks, Ray Davies) producing this collection of songs is beyond exciting for me. He is an invaluable piece of this puzzle, and I can’t wait to work with him in the studio. I’m also thrilled to have Chuck Turner (Johnny Cash, Loretta Lynn, Alison Krauss) engineering the album.</p>

<p>With over 150 dates on the calendar, 2018 started with the Cayamo cruise where Caleb played alongside John Prine, Buddy Miller, Jim Lauderdale, Brandi Carlile, Margo Price and many more. Since then, Caleb has toured relentlessly, sharing the stage with John Paul White, Lera Lynn, Ray Wylie Hubbard, Elizabeth Cook, Drivin’ N Cryin’, Aaron Lee Tasjan, Paul Thorn, ShinyRibs, JD McPherson, and The War &amp; Treaty. He was asked to play at Willie Nelson's ranch for Luck Reunion where he swapped songs in the round with Courtney Marie Andrews and Kevn Kinney. After Wildwood Revival, and headlining his six-week full band US tour this summer, he showcased to a packed house at AmericanaFest in Nashville, and played NPR’s World Cafe Live. He's starting 2019 supporting Corb Lund, then headed overseas for his UK Tour, including his official showcase at AmericanaFest UK in January, followed by a month long Scandinavian tour.</p>

Not only did Johnny and June Carter Cash record most all of their later music here, but many other talented musicians and famous entertainers have made music within the cabin. It is a dream come true to humbly join the ranks of my heroes who have recorded between these legendary walls.
To have John Jackson (The Jayhawks, Ray Davies) producing this collection of songs is beyond exciting for me. He is an invaluable piece of this puzzle, and I can’t wait to work with him in the studio. I’m also thrilled to have Chuck Turner (Johnny Cash, Loretta Lynn, Alison Krauss) engineering the album.

Voyagers of a new musical frontier, the Astronauts galvanise old-school RnB with slick new age funk. Formed in June 2016, the band is a quintet of like-minded musicians brought together by the love of all things funky and soulful. Within the next year, the boys released their debut single “Get Close” along with its accompanying music video.
Following their success, the Astronauts continue to shake up the music scene. Having opened for Tim De Cotta’s “Warrior” album launch in 2017, the band has and is slated to play at various noteworthy local festivals. To date, the band has shared the stage with notable artists such as Charlie Lim, Disco Hue and Stopgap. The Astronauts were also in the 2017 edition of the Noise Music Mentorship Program under the tutelage of Kevin Foo- a veteran of the local scene who has managed artists such as Linying, The Steve McQueens and Charlie Lim.
The Astronauts recently released their debut EP entitled 'ONE'. The second single off their EP, “Kryptonite”, peaked at #4 on Spotify Singapore’s Viral 50 list and is available on all major music streaming platforms.

<h2><strong>My Story</strong></h2>
<p>Becoming a grandparent last year, brought me full circle as a musician. Evaluating my life through that lens, helped me recognize that while I’m aging, my greatest creative accomplishments were yet unrealized. As a 40-something guitarist/songwriter, I have a myriad of experiences that have inspired me.</p>
<p>I have had the privilege of interacting with people from all walks of life. Their stories have inspired me to share in song about some of their struggles. This is where the concept behind the album Color Wheel developed. We are a collection of people uniquely shaped by personal tragedy and triumph. Representative by different colors across the spectrum of life. </p>
<p>This album represents my first large scale solo recording effort. In today’s new music business, independent artists have the opportunity to partner with their fans, family and friends to release their creative works on CD and vinyl. That is what this campaign is all about.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>I am seeking at least 200 people to partner with me at one of the four levels. Relentless pecking on a calculator, has determined that 200 people participating will satisfy all minimum quantities required by the merchandise vendors.</p>
<p>Some of the standout product offerings of this campaign are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Limited run t-shirts</li>
<li>Downloadable hi-res WAV files</li>
<li>Digipak CDs</li>
<li>Limited Edition Vinyl<ul>
<li>We are talking a very special 180 gram (audiophile grade)</li>
<li>Multicolored vinyl (each one is unique)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When they are gone, they are gone!</strong></p>
<p>To make the above merchandise a reality, I need to raise at least $6,000. In the sad event we cannot make that minimum goal a reality, we may have to eliminate the vinyl as an offering (Having gotten back into vinyl myself, I am hopeful we can avoid this scenario)</p>
<p>Your purchase makes a bold statement! IT SAYS that a small group partnering together can make dreams become a reality! IT SAYS independent creatives like myself can monetize their passions, regardless of age, race, etc. And most of all, it says grandparents can still ROCK!</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>One of the biggest challenges a musician faces is whether people will accept or even like their music. I suffer from it as well. Even though I have shared my music to a small group of friends during the album recording process with favorable feedback, I am still kept awake at night by the fear that this campaign will fall fall on its face and that people will suffer from involuntary vomiting when there hear the music. Unfortunately at the end of the day, sales, streams, and likes still are metrics a musician uses to gauge their success.</p>
<p>My hope is that your involvement in this project becomes the beginning of a beautiful friendship. With that said, feel free to share this campaign with your rock music loving friends.</p>

The whole time I was secretly writing songs. Private medicine to keep Self alive. Singing back to writers like Ani Difranco and Dar Williams.</p>
<p>The songs: One hundred of them. NObody heard them, at all, ever. Then I shared with friends who made me promise to get on stages, that week. I hit WCS competitions, won 12 times in a row, got rushed to L.A., scored a dance-remix-of-my-songs  type of situation, scored a likely tv placement, intense professional management, encouragement to write a ""little dumber"" and look ""a little younger."" Higher heels, bigger hair. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Then I lost myself. </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">I started trying to write what the industry monster told me I should.</span></p>
<ul> </ul> <p>I love 99% of monsters. The industry monster: Sucks. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Artists get screwed. But more critically, art itself gets lost. Songs saved my life at one point. So it with gravity that I say we need artistic control to stay in the artist's hands - because we NEED art.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">In July, Dar told me, ""The relationship between fan and artist is still pure. Find your fans directly."" Dar also cried two times when I played my songs for her (what?!?!). She said, ""Kress songs make the ordinary sacred"" and told me I was born to do this. </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">She is my absolute writing hero, so there is no greater external validation I can wait for.</span></p>
<p>When you pre-buy this next album, or please make a bigger contribution, you are DIRECTLY keeping me from seeking a record deal (a.k.a. losing creative control). And like heroes I admire like Ani and Macklemore, the songs go right from my mouth and my red guitar, right to you.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>THIS Album is different</h3>Alanis Morisette told me in a dream to take only the very best, mega-fan favorites from my 2015 pre-release ""demo"" album (""Difficult Life"", ""Joy"", ""Jesus Was a Lonely Girl"") and produce them BETTER. Add cello, add pauses, take our time, get professional production. Get the songs PERFECT (perfectly raw and emotional). And closer to the live Kress experience which everyone has been asking me how the heck I'll do.</div><div>
<br/><p>Then, Alanis said, take my 12 brand-new songs, the best songs I feel I've ever written (ala ""Little Bitty Mystic"") and make Kress' own ""Jagged Little Pill"" type of artistic statement. That's what I<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">'m asking you to pre-buy and in doing so, fund the making of now.</span></p>
<p>Alanis' ""Jagged Little Pill"" is ALL hits. Every song is a zinger. </p>
<p>She said in the dream, ""Do what I did. Release a crafted power album. On this album, only put the songs that are absolutely solid. And give them the production treatment they deserve.""</p>
<p>My tender hope, if any of these songs ever make you cry (like they do me), then this album will be ALL and only those. Every. Single. Track. Only the very best 15 songs of the 100 I've written. </p>
<p>These are songs you've been asking me for, they're ALL going to be on here. </p>
<p>Including the illustrious crowd-pleaser ""Bad Song"" (that song that sucks at being a song) and even the risky risky ""Ex"" (my ex is my ex for a reason). </p>
<p>And this time - I won't knock it out in one week like 2015's demo. With producer extraordinaire Margrit Eichler, we've got percussion in the works, violins, cello, beats, Regina Spektor-type and Tori Amos-type production inspiration. Quirk with the pauses, strings and space, and poetry you've come to expect from a Kress song.</p>
<p>This will be a first album I can be very very proud of. </p>
<p>Take time and NAIL it.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <ul> <li>It will take $8,000 to record it, get the badass cellist to riff on it, etc. and get it mastered so it sounds like a creamy cream-thing. I am paying $4,000 of my money I will work my butt off to earn and my super dream is that you will help with the other $4,000 by just...buying the album NOW.</li> <li>You get: Duh, Kress' ""Jaggged Little Pill"" album, to be titled...ALL HITS! Digital AND CD formats available with the fancy lyrics book so you can sing and cry along...because y'all know how I feel about words</li> <li>MORE perks you can buy! You tell me which song you want and I'll sing it in raw form and email it to you, with a custom greeting and thank you, just for you, in a casual honest spontaneous way, delivered right to your inbox. AND/OR Get a copy of the lovely demo I made in 2015! AND/OR Get me to come deliver songs to your face, live. I'll drive to you and bring folding chairs and give you a house concert. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">I'm very honored that the last concert I did someone said, ""Someone told me about the emotional/healing 'Kress Zone' they get in when hearing you live, and it is real! There's nothing like experiencing Kress songs live."" </span>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>I cannot with words tell you what this means.</p>

</div></div>","Keep Kress Independent I was a work addict for 13 years, like any good American. I was obsessed with my business. The whole time I was secretly writing songs. Private medicine to keep Self alive. Singing back to writers like Ani Difranco and Dar Williams.
The songs: One hundred of them. NObody heard them, at all, ever. Then I shared with friends who made me promise to get on stages, that week. I hit WCS competitions, won 12 times in a row, got rushed to L.A., scored a dance-remix-of-my-songs  type of situation, scored a likely tv placement, intense professional management, encouragement to write a ""little dumber"" and look ""a little younger."" Higher heels, bigger hair. Then I lost myself. I started trying to write what the industry monster told me I should.
  I love 99% of monsters. The industry monster: Sucks. Artists get screwed. But more critically, art itself gets lost. Songs saved my life at one point. So it with gravity that I say we need artistic control to stay in the artist's hands - because we NEED art.
In July, Dar told me, ""The relationship between fan and artist is still pure. Find your fans directly."" Dar also cried two times when I played my songs for her (what?!?!). She said, ""Kress songs make the ordinary sacred"" and told me I was born to do this. She is my absolute writing hero, so there is no greater external validation I can wait for.
When you pre-buy this next album, or please make a bigger contribution, you are DIRECTLY keeping me from seeking a record deal (a.k.a. losing creative control). And like heroes I admire like Ani and Macklemore, the songs go right from my mouth and my red guitar, right to you.

THIS Album is differentAlanis Morisette told me in a dream to take only the very best, mega-fan favorites from my 2015 pre-release ""demo"" album (""Difficult Life"", ""Joy"", ""Jesus Was a Lonely Girl"") and produce them BETTER. Add cello, add pauses, take our time, get professional production. Get the songs PERFECT (perfectly raw and emotional). And closer to the live Kress experience which everyone has been asking me how the heck I'll do.
Then, Alanis said, take my 12 brand-new songs, the best songs I feel I've ever written (ala ""Little Bitty Mystic"") and make Kress' own ""Jagged Little Pill"" type of artistic statement. That's what I'm asking you to pre-buy and in doing so, fund the making of now.
Alanis' ""Jagged Little Pill"" is ALL hits. Every song is a zinger. 
She said in the dream, ""Do what I did. Release a crafted power album. On this album, only put the songs that are absolutely solid. And give them the production treatment they deserve.""
My tender hope, if any of these songs ever make you cry (like they do me), then this album will be ALL and only those. Every. Single. Track. Only the very best 15 songs of the 100 I've written. 
These are songs you've been asking me for, they're ALL going to be on here. 
Including the illustrious crowd-pleaser ""Bad Song"" (that song that sucks at being a song) and even the risky risky ""Ex"" (my ex is my ex for a reason). 
And this time - I won't knock it out in one week like 2015's demo. With producer extraordinaire Margrit Eichler, we've got percussion in the works, violins, cello, beats, Regina Spektor-type and Tori Amos-type production inspiration. Quirk with the pauses, strings and space, and poetry you've come to expect from a Kress song.
This will be a first album I can be very very proud of. 
Take time and NAIL it.   What We Need & What You Get  It will take $8,000 to record it, get the badass cellist to riff on it, etc. and get it mastered so it sounds like a creamy cream-thing. I am paying $4,000 of my money I will work my butt off to earn and my super dream is that you will help with the other $4,000 by just...buying the album NOW. You get: Duh, Kress' ""Jaggged Little Pill"" album, to be titled...ALL HITS! Digital AND CD formats available with the fancy lyrics book so you can sing and cry along...because y'all know how I feel about words MORE perks you can buy! You tell me which song you want and I'll sing it in raw form and email it to you, with a custom greeting and thank you, just for you, in a casual honest spontaneous way, delivered right to your inbox. AND/OR Get a copy of the lovely demo I made in 2015! AND/OR Get me to come deliver songs to your face, live. I'll drive to you and bring folding chairs and give you a house concert. I'm very honored that the last concert I did someone said, ""Someone told me about the emotional/healing 'Kress Zone' they get in when hearing you live, and it is real! There's nothing like experiencing Kress songs live."" 
    The Impact I cannot with words tell you what this means.
How long I sat on songs alone. 
How hard I tumbled in my own personal hells. 
How I am aghast with gratitude that I've arrived to this amount of serenity and how I want to reach out with these words to anyone else having terror or joy.
What it means to share them and communicate with you.

support and come closer to artistic practices. </p>
<p>Every installation will be concretized thanks to partners, already engaged,
with local actors (foundations, associations, etc…). Their support will allow the
proposition of 2 concerts, from the 5 considered, in the unprivileged

</span><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span><h4><br/></h4>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">
<p>Colombia, a magical
landscape of « Macondian » stories of the Nobel prize winning author Gabriel García
Márquez, is naturally rich in exceptional diversity and is a fresh economic hope of
Latin America, but it is also a country that suffered 50 years of armed conflict and confronts the highest inequality index of its region today. For
the young generations, the lack of access to education and culture rests among
the most important factors of social difference.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b><br/></b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>A Devoted Committee</b></p>
<p>The members of EUPHONIA gathered together with the conviction that art is capable of embracing a creative message, being socially constructive and a legitimate change agent.</p>
<p>The association, that functions thanks to donations and volunteering, was created in France in 2014 after the initiative of Diego Franco, a Colombian pianist who has lived in Paris for  6 years, and is constituted by active French and Colombian young professionals, specialized in diverse areas.</p>
<br/><p><b>Our Mission</b></p>
<p>Through the transmission of
the musical practice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Encourage children, teenagers
     and the most vulnerable people to become conscious of their own importance
     and to seek the development of their own potential, despite their difficult
     life context.</li>
<li>Inform and increase general
     public awareness, as well as that of the actors -public and private-involved,
     towards cultural and social problems, trying to motivate them to take
     action.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Our Vision</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Perform and support artistic
     projects with social interest in order to open to their own populations
     enriching cultural experiences.</li>
<li>In a post-conflict context,
     weave the links between populations divided from political tensions, social
     inequalities or their specific condition (peasants, indigenous, urbans,
     expatriated…), through a neutral and noble theme, common to all – the
     musical practice.</li>
<li>Put in place a team, a network
     and a set of analysis and experiences in order to be able to propose
     pertinent solutions and to influence the decision making of official
     actors and particulars concerned with the issues hence studied.</li>
</ul>
<p>Though we focus on the Colombian case, EUPHONIA
aspires to develop a message with universal value.</p>

<p>La Colombie, paysage magique des histoires
« macondiennes » du Prix Nobel Gabriel García Márquez, nature à la
biodiversité exceptionnelle et nouvel espoir économique d’Amérique Latine, est
aussi un pays ayant souffert de plus de 50 ans de conflit armé, qui connait
aujourd’hui l’indice d’inégalité le plus élevé de sa région. Pour les nouvelles générations, le manque d’accès à l’éducation et à la culture
reste parmi les facteurs de différenciation sociale les plus déterminants. <br/></p>

<p>Los conciertos propondrán piezas del repertorio colombiano y
universal que tal vez muchos escucharán por primera vez. Los niños que quizá en
toda su vida no han tenido la oportunidad de ver un piano de cola, tendrán la
ocasión de escucharlo, de tocarlo y de descubrir su mecanismo. El conjunto de
la propuesta está dirigida a ofrecer una experiencia que invite al público a acercarse

<p>Cada
uno de los conciertos se realizará gracias a alianzas ya establecidas con
actores culturales locales (fundaciones y asociaciones). Su acompañamiento

<p>Colombia necesita propuestas que dinamicen sus ciudades, iniciativas que promuevan la apropiación del patrimonio artístico y del espacio público como un derecho y una efectiva herramienta de construcción de equidad.</p>
<p>La Unidad Móvil de Conciertos puede ser una manera de “llegar” a los barrios y pueblos marginales, invitándolos a redescubrir y a imaginar de otro modo los espacios públicos de su localidad.

<p>El<i> PianoMóvil </i>no es un medio de entretenimiento o de producción de sonidos: es un ministerio artístico y social que entiende la música como “el arte de entregar sonidos con generosidad”; la música como una invitación afectuosa a la excelencia.</p>

VERSION EN FRANCAIS >>> 



What's the PianoMóvil?


A pianist and a grand piano on a customized truck that transforms into a  concert stage for free concerts around Colombia.
PianoMóvil presents,
teaches, learns, transmits and highlights issues it has at heart.
In order to appreciate the value of this project, the sociopolitical
context of Colombia should be taken into account, as this country recovers from a
long armed conflict.
PianoMóvil creates links between people including those from different social classes.
It aspires to sow grains of peace and encourage the recognition of human life value in the spirit and in heart of the youngest.


A crowdfunding to finance the first steps of the PianoMóvil - Goal 2016



Before any major adventure, a first experience is needed. For that, after
several concerts in Paris to present the project, we will take an additional
step and perform a series of 5 free open air concerts in Bogotá and its surroundings.
This first experience will constitute the encounter of a French-Colombian
project, developed in France, with the Colombian soil and its inhabitants. This
experience should validate the potential and viability of a bigger National
Tour in 2017, and will be at the same time a previously unseen event in Colombia.

THE PILOT EXPERIENCE - AUGUST
2016


The Colombian Team of PianoMóvil has selected 5 pertinent places in
Bogotá and its surroundings.




We will install, on an open air stage, a grand piano with sound and
lighting system, for a concert followed or preceded by activities around the
subject of piano and music.
The concert will perform pieces of a colombian and universal repertory, most
of them will surely be heard for the first time by the public.
Children, who have probably never seen a grand piano before in their
lifetime, will have the opportunity to listen, play and discover its
mechanism.
The whole project aims to offer an experience that invites the public to
support and come closer to artistic practices. 
Every installation will be concretized thanks to partners, already engaged,
with local actors (foundations, associations, etc…). Their support will allow the
proposition of 2 concerts, from the 5 considered, in the unprivileged
neighborhoods.
Another concert will be proposed in one of the main business centers in Bogotá:
a direct invitation to the Colombian society to reinforce their support and
interest for artistic initiatives.

BUDGET AND FINANCING


We dream of a collective project, independent, loyal to its values and its
engagement to the people. It is for this reason that we wish that its
financing be mixed, that it will integrate both the small and big
contributions, coming from public or private sources, local and international.
We invite all those who believe in art’s capacity to transform society, to
join this adventure and make PianoMóvil a project of their own. We work
with all our efforts to offer a project that is transparent, federative,
serious and considerate of every detail. The association EUPHONIA's purpose is to translate the resources of our beneficiaries into pertinent and
significant actions for Colombia.




WHY AND FOR WHOM A PIANOMOVIL?



Colombia, a magical
landscape of « Macondian » stories of the Nobel prize winning author Gabriel García
Márquez, is naturally rich in exceptional diversity and is a fresh economic hope of
Latin America, but it is also a country that suffered 50 years of armed conflict and confronts the highest inequality index of its region today. For
the young generations, the lack of access to education and culture rests among
the most important factors of social difference.

A Devoted Committee
The members of EUPHONIA gathered together with the conviction that art is capable of embracing a creative message, being socially constructive and a legitimate change agent.
The association, that functions thanks to donations and volunteering, was created in France in 2014 after the initiative of Diego Franco, a Colombian pianist who has lived in Paris for  6 years, and is constituted by active French and Colombian young professionals, specialized in diverse areas.
Our Mission
Through the transmission of
the musical practice:

Encourage children, teenagers
     and the most vulnerable people to become conscious of their own importance
     and to seek the development of their own potential, despite their difficult
     life context.
Inform and increase general
     public awareness, as well as that of the actors -public and private-involved,
     towards cultural and social problems, trying to motivate them to take
     action.


Our Vision

Perform and support artistic
     projects with social interest in order to open to their own populations
     enriching cultural experiences.
In a post-conflict context,
     weave the links between populations divided from political tensions, social
     inequalities or their specific condition (peasants, indigenous, urbans,
     expatriated…), through a neutral and noble theme, common to all – the
     musical practice.
Put in place a team, a network
     and a set of analysis and experiences in order to be able to propose
     pertinent solutions and to influence the decision making of official
     actors and particulars concerned with the issues hence studied.

Though we focus on the Colombian case, EUPHONIA
aspires to develop a message with universal value.

WHAT WOULD BE THE BIG TOUR
OF PIANOMÓVIL ?


PianoMóvil’s real tour is an ambitious
project. It includes a grand piano, and above all a customized bus that
transforms itself in a real stage. It has a sound and audio system for the
realization of a documentary.
Such a mobile unit will have
the capacity to perform annual tours. Real trips for territorial exploration,
moving encounters, the discovery of local music and musicians and dialogues
between different traditions … 2.547 kilometers of music !

Qu'est-ce que le PianoMóvil ? 

Un pianiste et son piano embarqués sur un camion, pour des concerts itinérants à travers la Colombie.
Le PianoMóvil présente, enseigne, apprend, transmet, met en évidence des problématiques qui lui sont chères. 
Pour apprécier la valeur de sa démarche, il faut tenir compte du contexte sociopolitique de la Colombie, qui se remet doucement d'un long conflit armé. 
Le PianoMóvil crée des liens entre populations et classes sociales différentes. Il sème des graines de paix et encourage la valorisation de la vie humaine dans l'esprit et dans le cœur des plus jeunes.


Un crowdfunding pour financer les premiers pas du PianoMóvil - Objectif 2016

Avant toute aventure d'envergure, il faut une première expérience. C'est pourquoi, après plusieurs concerts à Paris pour présenter le projet, nous faisons un pas de plus et proposons une série de 5 concerts gratuits en plein air à Bogotá et sa périphérie. 
Cette première expérience constituera la rencontre d'un projet franco-colombien, développé en France, avec le sol colombien et ses habitants. Elle devra valider le potentiel et la viabilité d’une grande Tournée Nationale
en 2017 tout en constituant un événement inédit en Colombie.


L’EXPÉRIENCE PILOTE - AOÛT 2016

L'équipe colombienne du PianoMóvil a sélectionné 5 lieux pertinents à Bogotá et ses environs.




 Nous y installerons, sur une estrade en plein air, un grand piano à queue sonorisé et éclairé, pour un concert suivi ou précédé d'activités autour du piano et de la musique.
Le concert proposera des morceaux du répertoire colombien et universel, que la plupart entendra
pour la première fois.Les enfants, qui n’ont probablement
jamais vu un piano à queue de leur vie, auront l’occasion de l’écouter, d'en jouer, de découvrir
son mécanisme. L'ensemble du dispositif  vise à offrir une expérience qui invite le public à soutenir et à se rapprocher des pratiques artistiques. 
Chaque installation sera concrétisée grâce à des partenariats, d'ores et déjà engagés, avec des acteurs locaux (fondations, associations,..). Leur accompagnement
nous permettra de proposer notamment 2 concerts sur les 5, dans des quartiers très défavorisés. Un
autre concert sera proposé dans l’un des centres d’affaires de Bogotá, telle une invitation faite à
la société colombienne de renforcer son soutien et son intérêt pour les initiatives
artistiques. 


LE BUDGET ET SON FINANCEMENT

Nous rêvons d'un projet collectif,
indépendant, fidèle à ses valeurs et à son engagement envers les gens. C’est
pourquoi nous souhaitons que sont financement soit mixte, qu'il intègre les petites comme les grandes contributions, qu'il soit d'origine publique et privée, locale et internationale. 
Nous invitons tous ceux qui croient en la capacité de l’art à transformer la société, à rejoindre cette aventure et à faire
sien le PianoMóvil. Nous travaillons de toutes nos forces pour proposer un projet
fédérateur, transparent, sérieux, pensé dans tous ses détails. L'association Euphonia a pour
but de traduire les ressources de nos bienfaiteurs en actions pertinentes et
significatives pour la Colombie. 





POURQUOI ET POUR QUI UN PIANOMÓVIL ?

La Colombie, paysage magique des histoires
« macondiennes » du Prix Nobel Gabriel García Márquez, nature à la
biodiversité exceptionnelle et nouvel espoir économique d’Amérique Latine, est
aussi un pays ayant souffert de plus de 50 ans de conflit armé, qui connait
aujourd’hui l’indice d’inégalité le plus élevé de sa région. Pour les nouvelles générations, le manque d’accès à l’éducation et à la culture
reste parmi les facteurs de différenciation sociale les plus déterminants. 


Un collectif engagé 
Les membres d’EUPHONIA sont réunis par la conviction de la capacité de l’art à porter un message créatif, transformateur et socialement constructif. 
L’association qui fonctionne grâce aux donations et au bénévolat, a été créée en France en 2014 à l’initiative de Diego Franco, pianiste colombien vivant à Paris depuis 6 ans, et se compose de jeunes actifs français et colombiens issus de domaines divers.

Notre
Mission
A travers la
transmission de la pratique musicale :


Encourager
les enfants, les adolescents et les personnes les plus vulnérables à prendre
conscience de leur propre importance et à s’efforcer de développer leur
potentiel malgré un contexte de vie difficile.

Informer
et sensibiliser le grand public, ainsi que les acteurs publics et privés
concernés, à des problématiques culturelles et sociales en les incitant à
entreprendre des actions.

Notre Vision

Proposer et soutenir
     des projets artistiques à vocation sociale afin d’offrir à ces mêmes populations des expériences enrichissantes sur le
     plan culturel.
Dans un
     contexte de post-conflit, tisser des liens entre les populations séparées
     par les tensions politiques, par les inégalités sociales ou par leur
     condition (paysans, indigènes, citadins, expatriés…) grâce à une
     thématique neutre, noble et commune à tous – la pratique musicale.
Mettre
     en place une équipe, un réseau et un ensemble d’analyses et d’expériences
     afin de pouvoir proposer des solutions pertinentes et d’influencer la
     prise de décisions des acteurs officiels et particuliers concernés par les
     problématiques ainsi étudiées.


Même si nous nous focalisons sur le cas particulier de la Colombie,  EUPHONIA aspire à développer un message à valeur
universelle.


EN QUOI CONSISTE LA GRANDE TOURNÉE DU PIANOMÓVIL ? - Objectif 2017

La vraie tournée PianoMóvil est
un projet ambitieux. Il comprend un beau piano à queue, et surtout un camion
customisé qui se transforme en une véritable scène. Il est doté d’un équipement audio et vidéo
pour la réalisation d’un documentaire. 
Une telle unité mobile autonome aurait la capacité de proposer des tournées
annuelles. De véritables voyages d’exploration du territoire, des rencontres
touchantes, la découverte de musiques et de musiciens locaux, de dialogues
entre traditions différentes… 2.547 kilomètres de musique !

¿QUÉ ES EL PIANOMÓVIL?

Un pianista y un piano que viajan en un camión para realizar conciertos itinerantes a través del territorio colombiano. 
El PianoMóvil presenta, enseña, aprende, transmite y visibiliza algunas problemáticas con las que se identifica. 
Para apreciar el valor del proyecto PianoMóvil hay que tener en cuenta el contexto sociopolítico en Colombia. 
El PianoMóvil crea vínculos entre poblaciones y clases sociales diferentes. Aspira a sembrar granos de paz y de apreciación del valor de la vida humana en el pensamiento y en el corazón de los más jóvenes. 






COLECTA DE FONDOS - Objetivo 2016

Los primeros pasos del PianoMóvil. 

Antes
de toda gran aventura es necesaria una primera experiencia. Es por esto que,
luego de haber realizado varios conciertos en París para presentar el proyecto, queremos dar un
paso más: una serie de 5 conciertos gratuitos y al aire libre en
Bogotá y su periferia. 
Esta primera experiencia será el encuentro de un proyecto franco-colombiano, concebido en Francia, con el territorio colombiano y
sus habitantes. Nuestra prueba piloto será un evento inédito en Colombia, y demostrará la viabilidad y el potencial del proyecto para una gran gira nacional en 2017. 

  EXPERIENCIA PILOTO- agosto 2016  5 conciertos en Bogotá.

El equipo del PianoMóvil seleccionó 5 lugares estratégicos en Bogotá y sus alrededores.



Allí instalaremos sobre una tarima al aire libre un
gran piano de cola con sonido e iluminación, para hacer un concierto acompañado
por actividades y talleres relacionados con el piano y la música.
Los conciertos propondrán piezas del repertorio colombiano y
universal que tal vez muchos escucharán por primera vez. Los niños que quizá en
toda su vida no han tenido la oportunidad de ver un piano de cola, tendrán la
ocasión de escucharlo, de tocarlo y de descubrir su mecanismo. El conjunto de
la propuesta está dirigida a ofrecer una experiencia que invite al público a acercarse
y a apoyar las prácticas artísticas.
Cada
uno de los conciertos se realizará gracias a alianzas ya establecidas con
actores culturales locales (fundaciones y asociaciones). Su acompañamiento
nos permitirá especialmente proponer dos de nuestros cinco conciertos en
barrios de estratos uno y dos. 
Otro concierto será realizado en uno de los
centros de negocios de Bogotá: esta será una invitación hecha a la sociedad
colombiana para renovar su apoyo y su interés por las iniciativas artísticas.



FINANCIAMIENTO Y PRESUPUESTO


Soñamos un proyecto colectivo, independiente, fiel a sus propios valores y a su compromiso con las personas. Es por esto que deseamos que su financiamiento sea mixto, que integre los pequeños y los grandes contribuyentes, que tenga un origen público y privado, local e internacional.
Invitamos a todos los que crean en la capacidad del arte para transformar la sociedad a unirse a esta aventura y a apropiarse del PianoMóvil. Todos nuestros esfuerzos buscan proponer un proyecto incluyente, transparente, y serio; cuyos gastos se detallan a continuación. El colectivo EUPHONIA tiene como objetivo traducir los recursos de nuestros donantes en acciones pertinentes y significativas para Colombia.




¿POR QUÉ Y PARA QUIÉN UN PIANOMÓVIL?





Colombia necesita propuestas que dinamicen sus ciudades, iniciativas que promuevan la apropiación del patrimonio artístico y del espacio público como un derecho y una efectiva herramienta de construcción de equidad.
La Unidad Móvil de Conciertos puede ser una manera de “llegar” a los barrios y pueblos marginales, invitándolos a redescubrir y a imaginar de otro modo los espacios públicos de su localidad. También puede ser un modo de crear escenarios de encuentro entre personas con intereses, actividades y niveles de ingresos distintos, propiciando la convivencia y el deseo de compartir.
El PianoMóvil no es un medio de entretenimiento o de producción de sonidos: es un ministerio artístico y social que entiende la música como “el arte de entregar sonidos con generosidad”; la música como una invitación afectuosa a la excelencia.



Un colectivo comprometido
Los miembros de EUPHONIA se reúnen por la convicción de que el arte tiene la capacidad de transmitir un mensaje creativo, transformador y socialmente constructivo.
La asociación, que funciona gracias a donaciones y voluntarios, fue creada en 2014 por iniciativa de Diego Franco, pianista colombiano residente en Francia desde hace 6 años, y se compone de jóvenes parisinos y colombianos con profesiones diversas. 

Nuestra misión
A través la divulgación de la práctica musical:


Inspirar a los niños, a los jóvenes y a los más vulnerables a ser conscientes de su propia importancia y a esforzarse por desarrollar su potencial a pesar de un contexto adverso.

Informar y sensibilizar al público general y a los actores privados y públicos pertinentes acerca de problemáticas culturales y sociales, incitándolos a embarcarse en la búsqueda de soluciones.



Visión


Proponer y respaldar proyectos artísticos con vocación social para ofrecer a niños, jóvenes y poblaciones aisladas, experiencias enriquecedoras en el plano cultural.

En un contexto de conflicto, tejer vínculos entre poblaciones alejadas por su ideología, por su situación socioeconómica o por su condición (campesinos, indígenas, citadinos…) gracias a una temática neutra, noble y común a todos: la práctica musical.

Consolidar un equipo, una red y un conjunto de análisis y de experiencias con el fin de proponer soluciones pertinentes y de influenciar la toma de decisiones por parte de actores oficiales y particulares.


Al focalizarse en el caso particular de Colombia, EUPHONIA aspira a desarrollar un mensaje de valor universal.

¿EN QUÉ CONSISTE LA GIRA DEL PIANOMÓVIL ? - objetivo 2017

La gira del PianoMóvil es un proyecto ambicioso, consiste

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Dear friends &amp; supporters,<br/><br/>I have created this campaign to help fund the creation of my new album, <i><strong>Solar</strong></i>. Following on from my previous album, ‘Find Your Love’ released in 2017, <i><strong>Solar</strong></i> is a development of this intimate but epic sound. This is achieved by combining a small orchestral string section with expressionistic electric guitar, as well as drums and percussion.<br/><br/>The money from this campaign will be used to pay for the recording of the string sections. This is split into two sessions; one session of fourteen players (eight violins, three violas, three cellos) and another session with a string quartet (two violins, a viola and a cello). The money will go towards paying for studio time, a recording engineer, and to pay the players themselves. The players who I intend to work with on this album are world class, each bringing their immense expertise and experience to help me create the inspirational sounds on <i><strong>Solar</strong></i>.<br/><br/>Working with a classical string sections is a very important part of my compositional style. I have been composing with strings, guitars and percussion for almost twenty years. I find the sound to be dramatic, cinematic and emotive, as well as being sincere and serious. As a guitar player I have a natural affinity to stringed instruments. They provide a sound which is evocative of space and time, giving my compositions scope and latitude, but never losing sight of the human scale.<br/><br/><i><strong>Solar</strong></i>, like my previous albums which feature a string section and my distinctive guitar sound, will slowly unfold with sweeping, uplifting melodies and textures. I am very happy to be working on it, and I am looking forward to sharing it with you all.<br/><br/>The album will be released in the first half of 2020, with a launch concert in Melbourne to follow.<br/><br/><strong>Rewards for supporters include:</strong><br/><br/>Every donation will receive a download of a high quality digital audio file of 'Solar', the title track.<br/><br/>Every donation over $35 will receive a high quality digital audio file of the completed album.<br/><br/>Every donation over $55 will receive a limited edition signed cd plus a high quality digital audio file of the completed album. <br/><br/>All contributions, big or small, are very much appreciated.

<p>Hi, I'm Nathaniel Earl -- composer, writer, producer, and performer living in Austin, TX. I write music for film and video games, I've been involved in a few bands here in Austin as well -- <strong>Manican Dream</strong>, <strong>The Minutes and the Miles</strong>, and <strong>The Storms</strong>.</p>
<p>I've been compiling music for a solo release for a few years, and I'm really excited to share with you the debut release from this catalogue. <strong>""Imaginary Rabbit"" </strong>is a 2 song EP created specifically for a 7 inch vinyl release.</p>
<p>I asked <strong>Jeff Bye</strong> to help produce this record. The production on this album is something I can't even begin to describe. It's chaos, it's serenity....intimate and vibrant. It sounds as if the music has given birth a billion musical microbes that move in unison and harmony. Take a listen to side B of the EP, ""Bulletproof"".</p>

We will have a lush lighting design filling the space, as well as a powerful sound system. There will be ample adult beverages (all included in the price of admission).

<p>HI EVERYONE!</p>
<p>We are the <strong>KAIA string quartet</strong>, a Chicago based ensemble committed to promoting the music of <strong>Latin-America</strong>. We have been together since 2010 and we are really excited about continuing our growth by bringing to light music from Latino composers that the world would <strong>love</strong> to hear! </p>
<p>This campaign is to raise funds to produce a <strong>video</strong> and the last stages of an audio recording titled <strong><i>Sureño</i></strong>. The album will contain Astor <strong>Piazzolla</strong>’s <i>4 Estaciones Porteñas,</i> arranged by Gerardo Moreira, and a beautiful and not so known work by José  <strong>Bragato</strong>, <i>Tres piezas para cuarteto de cuerdas basadas en ritmos de tango</i>. This music portrays <strong>Buenos Aires</strong> from all its angles, from two musicians that definitely made an impact in the musical life of Argentina and South America. <strong>SERIOUSLY GOOD</strong> :-) </p>
<p>You might ask yourself: <strong>why this recording?</strong> There is a beautiful connection between these composers.

We had to learn sooooooooooo many things on the go and quite honestly, confront multiple <strong>obstacles</strong> that made things harder.

</div></div>","HI EVERYONE!
We are the KAIA string quartet, a Chicago based ensemble committed to promoting the music of Latin-America. We have been together since 2010 and we are really excited about continuing our growth by bringing to light music from Latino composers that the world would love to hear! 
This campaign is to raise funds to produce a video and the last stages of an audio recording titled Sureño. The album will contain Astor Piazzolla’s 4 Estaciones Porteñas, arranged by Gerardo Moreira, and a beautiful and not so known work by José  Bragato, Tres piezas para cuarteto de cuerdas basadas en ritmos de tango. This music portrays Buenos Aires from all its angles, from two musicians that definitely made an impact in the musical life of Argentina and South America. SERIOUSLY GOOD :-) 
You might ask yourself: why this recording? There is a beautiful connection between these composers. Plus, these pieces and arrangements have not been professionally recorded yet, and we want KAIA to be the first.  The Piazzolla seasons are well known but these arrangements were especially made for us and they have been a big staple of our quartet in concerts.

<h3>Making a new EP and starting a company in Medellín... </h3>
<p>My name is Rob LaFond I am a musician, photographer and entrepreneur. I am working on my 3rd EP of a trilogy series I started in Los Angeles in 2014 with ""When We Fly."" I released the 2nd EP ""High and Low"" last year with the single ""She's Dangerous."" The 3rd EP will complete the sentence ""When we fly and low..."" and finish this series. I would like to record this one hear in Colombia. </p>
<p>After some soul searching and discovery I left my home of 11 years in Los Angeles and went for a trip to South America. It led me to the city of eternal spring, Medellín. Here I have made lots of friends and business contacts. I have been continuing my music career and have done lots interesting collaborations. Recently I started my own business called LaFond Medellin. It is centered around a logo that I created with the city name and has been growing steadily. My clothing and apparel is available in 5 locations and we just opened our central location inside my friends super cool coffee shop, Café Revolución 2 located in the beautiful neighborhood of Laureles. </p>
<p>This 3rd edition of my music series is sure to be special and I'm exited to share my experience and story with you all once more in the form of music. These are mostly songs I wrote in Los Angeles and I would like to record them with some of my friends here in Colombia with some possible LA collaborations. These will be mostly acoustic songs with some layered drums and bass that we will do in the studio. It's really important for me to finish this series and share these songs with you as I love to stay creative and express myself through  music, but I don't see myself as a musician alone. I am a creative and I use many different means to express myself. The other ways I do that are through photography, and design with my company LaFond Medellin which I will tell you about next.</p>
<p>So yes it's official I opened a company in Medellín and I have a visa to work here for 3 years. I started a clothing and apparel brand that's centered around one main Medellin design right now that is getting popular around the city and I would like to expand that to new designs and do work based on photography as well. Right now our main item is t-shirts and tank tops, but I am branching out to other merchandise too. We have coffee mugs and I just made the first prototype for an umbrella. I would like to expand to posters, prints, notebooks, scarfs, and magnets. The money you help me raise for this campaign will help me do that. I would also like to build an online store and start shipping internationally. The other goal that I have this year is to get the equipment I need to take the production in house and start printing our own shirts and products. Right now we are working with a manufacturer. I would like for people to be able to come into the store and have me take a photograph or create and graphic and print it for them right there. </p>

<p>If I go over my goal, which I would like to do. I will use it to purchase that equipment and I would also like to record a live blues album with video (production is not that expensive here:). If you would like to see that happen please keep giving to the campaign. I have the studio, musicians, and songs ready to go. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528137205/dzmqmsuixiy7cm3pqrnc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Right now I am really happy to be in such a great place with my business and to get to work with so many great people in such a great location, but I would also like to keep taking it to the next level. You can help me do that. There are a lot of people outside of Medellín who are interested in these products and this will be the first step in reaching that audience. </p>

<p>If you donate to this campaign it will help me a great deal in reaching these goals. Taking this creative path, moving to a foreign country and starting my own business is definitely one of the most challenging things I've ever done, but it has been the most rewarding. To see people wearing the clothes around town, enjoying the designs, taking photos, and representing this great city here and beyond is a joy. Help me keep this project going. </p>
<p>Thank you so much for being a part of this,</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I set my goal low so it would be reachable at $2,500, but I would really like to reach $3,500-4k. My goal is to record my next EP and finish the series, but I have even more creative ideas so I don't want it to be limited to that. If I go beyond my goal I will record a live blues album with videos that you will be able to watch of each of the songs. I have special plans for that and beyond that I would start purchasing the equipment that I need to start printing the t-shirts in house which is what I would really like to do. I would like for people to be able to come into the shop and have me take a photo and put it on shirt for them right there or make custom one-off Medellín shirts. </p>
<p>What you will get is cool well designed t-shirts and products made directly in Medellín, Colombia. I will be able to expand online and start printing postcards, prints, custom shirts, the awesome styles I already have and to do the new merchandise like umbrellas, mugs, and notebooks.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It means so much to have my community support me. You will make it possible for my business to grow and you will inspire me and help get involved with new ideas. Medellín is great city and I would love to see you all supporting it and representing it in a positive way. There is a lot of beautiful people and culture and I want you to see and be a part of it. If you support me I promise to deliver and make you proud with my best work. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I've taken a lot of risks and challenges starting my own business in a foreign country. I was afraid that it wouldn't work and that people wound't be interested, but I see people coming in and buying the merchandise and t-shirts then taking photos of how much they love it, it inspires me. You inspire me. Also, there is the fear I could fail and that you guys won't support me and you'll think I'm stupid, but I would like to prove that negative voice in my head wrong and help see this vision though. Why? Because it's awesome and we should all work on things we are truly passionate about. </p>

</p><p></p><p>Hello Family, Friends and Music Lovers!</p>
<p>Helen here from the “Looping Glass”
Team.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for taking the time
to visit the Indiegogo page for “Lost in the Looping Glass” hits the
road!  Read on for more information about the show, the exciting new tour
and how you can be a part of the Looping Glass journey…</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>What is “Lost in the Looping Glass”?</b></p>
<p>“Lost in the Looping Glass” is an
original show for violin and live electronic looping. Moving from one loop
pedal to the next and back again I create, explore and fall head first into a
multitude of musical worlds.  All of a sudden, the violin becomes so much
more than it first appears; a storm at sea, a walk through the forest, the far
reaches of the audiences’ imaginations!</p><p></p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F4m4PMyAjjMw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D4m4PMyAjjMw&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F4m4PMyAjjMw%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p></p><p>Premiering at Melbourne Fringe
Festival 2015 to fantastic reviews, “Lost in the Looping Glass” is heading on
tour to share its loopy love with the music enthusiasts of Western Australia
and New Zealand.  And we want YOU to be involved! </p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Why a crowdfunding campaign?</b></p>
<p>We are really excited to announce
that early in 2016 “Lost in the Looping Glass” will feature at <a href=""http://www.fringeworld.com.au/program/event/ebdf54f9-a073-426b-862a-36b57746ef43/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">FRINGE WORLD Festival</a> in Perth and

is complete, the venues are booked, there’s no turning back now!  </p>
<p>The show had a fantastic premiere
season at the 2015 Melbourne Fringe Festival to great reviews.  But what
was more important to us was the response from the audience.  People
really connected to the show and the music gave them the opportunity to leave
the real world at the door and get lost in their own worlds for a while. This
response was all we needed to make the decision to take the show on tour to

<p><u>Helen Bower: Producer/Performer</u></p>
<p>I’m a violinist from the UK, currently living and
working in Melbourne, Australia.  I started creating and presenting

<p>Since moving to Australia I have focused on

“Lost in the Looping Glass” is the result of a fantastic collaboration with
Melbourne composer Charles MacInnes and a development of the successful 2015
show “Through the Looping Glass” which features new compositions from
Australian and UK composers.</p>
<p><u>Charles MacInnes: Producer/Sound Design</u></p>
<p>Melbourne based composer Charles MacInnes combines
musical techniques and sounds that bridge the orchestral to the electronic, the
scripted to the spontaneous. He has composed music for Melbourne Chamber Choir,
Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, violinist Sarah Curro, pianist Michael Kieran
Harvey, Australian Brass Quintet, Syzygy Ensemble and Plexus Collective as well
as working as a sound designer for animators, short film makers and
installation artists. His particular interest in looping is to find imaginative
ways of combining layers and multiple parts—how can this give us something in a
performance that would otherwise not be possible? </p>
<p>Myself and Charles began collaborating when he
wrote the beautiful ‘Wall Fragments’ for “Through the Looping Glass” and it has
been a lot of fun developing “Lost in the Looping Glass” together over the last

<p><u>Gina Somfleth: Sound engineer/Video editor</u></p>
<p>The ever cheerful Gina has been on board right from
the start, as sound engineer for both “Looping Glass” shows.  She has also
recorded the shows and edited all the footage into the promo videos, sound
bites and this campaign video!  We absolutely love having her in the Looping Glass family and I can't thank her enough for all her talent and support!</p>
<p><u>Jen Pomphrey: Graphic Design</u></p>
<p>Also hailing from the UK is graphic designer
Jen.  She is responsible for almost all of the wonderful artwork for both

Helen here from the “Looping Glass”
Team.
Thank you so much for taking the time
to visit the Indiegogo page for “Lost in the Looping Glass” hits the
road!  Read on for more information about the show, the exciting new tour
and how you can be a part of the Looping Glass journey…
What is “Lost in the Looping Glass”?
“Lost in the Looping Glass” is an
original show for violin and live electronic looping. Moving from one loop
pedal to the next and back again I create, explore and fall head first into a
multitude of musical worlds.  All of a sudden, the violin becomes so much
more than it first appears; a storm at sea, a walk through the forest, the far
reaches of the audiences’ imaginations!
Premiering at Melbourne Fringe
Festival 2015 to fantastic reviews, “Lost in the Looping Glass” is heading on
tour to share its loopy love with the music enthusiasts of Western Australia
and New Zealand.  And we want YOU to be involved! 
Why a crowdfunding campaign?
We are really excited to announce
that early in 2016 “Lost in the Looping Glass” will feature at FRINGE WORLD Festival in Perth and
the NZ Fringe Festival in Wellington.  Registration
is complete, the venues are booked, there’s no turning back now!  
The show had a fantastic premiere
season at the 2015 Melbourne Fringe Festival to great reviews.  But what
was more important to us was the response from the audience.  People
really connected to the show and the music gave them the opportunity to leave
the real world at the door and get lost in their own worlds for a while. This
response was all we needed to make the decision to take the show on tour to
share it with many more people.
This campaign is here to help get me
to the festivals and then to make sure we get the word out to as many people as
possible to fill those venues.  Your contributions will particularly make all the difference to our marketing capabilities, which is so important when
touring a show.  When you are performing in places where your networks are
smaller, every dollar can make a difference to reaching your audience and
letting them know about the show.
So have a look at the perks on the
right hand side of the page, to see how you can help this show take the next
step in its journey and to support live, independent and original music thrive.
What
will your donations go towards?Touring a show has many costs – travel,
accommodation, venue hire, technician fees, insurance and licences, marketing;
the list goes on! 
Funds from this campaign will cover my flights to
Perth and New Zealand, a roof over my head whilst I’m there and go towards the marketing
for each festival.  We’ve
already got everything else covered with the profits from Melbourne Fringe
Festival (hooray!)What do you get?
We’ve put together a great bunch of perks and rewards for you
to choose from and there’s something for every budget.  We wanted to make
sure all the perks were personal and so each one will be written, packaged
and sent direct from us, to you.  
From a heartfelt Thank You email, to a series of
“on tour” postcards (a nice surprise in the post is always a win isn’t it?!) or
even a violin and loop piece written especially for you, we hope you will find
something you like.
And we know that not everyone can contribute –

<p>We had a blast writing together, but when we performed the song live, it was the crowd’s reaction that gave us the momentum to pursue it further.

<h3>Our Bus, Our Home &amp; Our Life</h3>
<p>Hi!  We're St. Cinder, a band of vagabond musicians who have been lucky enough to make our way from the street corner to the stage to the studio and now are hoping to embark on our first fully booked tour through the Southwest.</p>
<p>Now after a national road trip following our first studio album, sharing our music from Seattle to Tuscon to New Orleans to Portland, Maine and back again, the cornerstone of our livelih&amp;ood--our bus Betsy--is on her way to bus heaven.  That's why we need your help!</p>
<h2>Here's the Breakdown</h2>
</div><div>
<p>Well, we're broke down. And broke.  Luckily for us some of us are mechanically minded enough to have kept us rolling by the skin of our hats, but it seems those days are over.  With only a few weeks before our first planned show in Flagstaff (on Dec. 3rd!) we have to buy a bus, register and insure it, do a little skeleton carpentry to keep dogs and banjos and sleeping bags from sliding around, make the 24 hour drive, and drink enough coffee to actually play our Show!</p>
<p>Plan B is to take Betsy on her final stretch of road, and hope she breaks down for good right next to a bus we can afford.</p>
<p>Either way it's gonna be a bumpy road, but with your help we can keep our band off the side of the Road!</p>
<p>Now, what's in it for you?  As hobos, we don't have all too much to offer other than our music, but we have plenty of that!  To boost our campaign we'll be recording a new live album on the 19th at La Baggett, including brand new originals never-before-heard by the world wide web, as well as a healthy dose of our classic renditions of traditional roots tunes, never before released!</p>
<p>Also rewards include our first studio album, Vagabond Dreams, in an actual CD sleeve with its sweet new artwork by Yamana Soto--quite a step up from the lunch bag if you bought our album on the street!</p>
<p>On top of all that we have ransacked our bus and thrown in a couple goodies for the lucky few.  But who knows what other surprises are on the horizon!</p>
<ul><li>Our goal is us aiming low. We could use a lot more than $5,450.00,  but we can also probably work with less. A well-running bus could easily cost that much, not to mention registration, insurance, potential break downs, and the eternal gas bill.  However, we're good at making do.  Can of beans, junk bus, same thing to us.  That said, after all these years on the road, we're crossing our fingers on this one.</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact (Boom!)</h3>
<p>Listen, we're all homeless.  With a bus, we are, in our eyes, non-quite-homeless.  With just our wits and our music we've gone all the way around the country and brought the soul food of sound to thousands of smiling faces.  With a little boost, we plan to up our capabilities to reach a larger audience, and make our full time career more sustainable with our growing demand.</p>
<p>What Could Possibly Go Wrong?</p>
</div><div>
<p>Everyone knows the risks involved in buying a used vehicle.  And with lives on a shoestring, nothing is guaranteed.  However, you have our assurance that our one and all are dedicated to making this dream a reality.  A bus is far more than a vehicle to us.  It' a (literal) step up from our feet on the highway.  We couldn't think of a better (or another, really) way to spend this money in a million years or a million miles.</p>
<p>If we don't raise enough to get a new vehicle by the end of our 15 day campaign, we are going to gamble on taking Betsy out on the road and hoping through a continued campaign to find a new bus while on tour.</p>

 McGregor and Murray began collaborating in 2009, and quickly realized 
that the music of Bach was a common passion. Bach's flute sonatas are 
some of the most beautiful, complex and rewarding music in the flute's 
repertoire. This CD will be the first of two discs of the complete flute
 sonatas, focusing on the sonatas for flute and obligato keyboard: A 
major, b minor, E-flat major and g minor.<br/></p>
<p>Money raised will pay for the recording technician, 
producer fees and editing. Anything raised above and beyond our $3000 goal 
will go towards the pressing of 1000 digipak CDs. Please support us!</p>

SOUND INSTALLATION


-raw essentials-
I am a drummer, music producer, and student at Emerson College.
As a student in the BFA Program, I am in charge of an independent project. 
My pursuit is about the sound of drums in a variety of spaces,
with the goal of capturing their sounds and 
the acoustic reactions to where they’re placed.
I began this project to create a sample pack of my recorded drums,
but I collected much unpredicted footage along the way.
Acquiring this extra material has involved analog manipulation of previously recorded sounds, 
and raw recordings of whatever is percussive or rhythmic. 

So far, I have done fifteen official recording sessions in Boston, Philadelphia, and some locations in between.
There are pictures posted in the gallery of a few of the spaces and scenarios. For many of the sessions I was lucky enough to have hard-working sound engineers to work with.  Others I did alone.
The resulting sound library from these recordings is entitled 
raw essentials.
I have been creating beats with the raw essentials since I started the recordings using Reaper and ProTools as my digital audio workstations.
Like the great producers that I look up to, I am always searching for the perfect sample - the loop, the foundation of the beat, listened to repeatedly, endlessly. Producers like J. Dilla, Showbiz, and Kutmasta Kurt are my inspirations, as well as electronic music such as Venetian Snares and Telefon Tel Aviv, and drummers like Terry Bozzio, Zach Hill, Steve Reid, Max Roach, and Brian Chippendale.
-PERCUSSIONVIRONMENTS-
- a sound installation which represents the music made from the raw essentials recordings.
- an homage to the hip-hop producer and their mission to find the perfect sample,
and create their own style simultaneously.
- a beat tape mixed for four speakers, played from a cassette
The person who experiences Percussionvironments will be placed in an situation where the inherent action is listening. 
Speakers projecting the music will be enclosed by the drums that were played to acquire the sounds, so that the listener experiences what I have with the drums in a way that is only possible if entered.  
The beats will be interrupted by recorded footage of live drum kit playing presented with processing by way of re-amplification through guitar amplifiers and pedals. 
My goal is to color the beat tape as a whole with the cohesive palette of sounds I’ve recorded so that it is a unique sonic experience any way it is played back. 
When the tape stops, it must be rewound by the participating listener.
The Impact
WHAT IS THE NEW STANDARD IN HIP-HOP PRODUCTION?

This is my view of a new standard for producers. The goal is to sample only what I’ve documented in order to interpret and share where I’ve traveled with my drums. This is not only an embrace, but an exploration of a standard I set for myself and others. 

It’s about renewing, revising, and modernizing musical traditions.
The recorded sounds themselves are studies on aural architecture. They let the listener sense the spatial attributes of wherever it is placed by way of spatiality, which is the experience of space by way of listening  (see further).
The music will be mixed to show the magnitude of the sounds that were created within the spaces I chose.
In that sense, the installation will show listeners how drums (and cymbals, and many objects) react to an acoustic arena. I want the audience to consider what it might be like if they were in these spaces and the room had a sonic reaction to their own voice.
How would that make them feel? What kind of voice can we get from ourselves when we purposely travel with our own voice in mind? Where do we hear the best voice we have? 
What is our voice saying, and how are we hearing it?

<p>I love instrumental music, avant-garde and free jazz.

<p>I love experimenting and free thinking. That’s why I couldn’t keep up with college and schools. I practice differently. I express myself and let the sounds and music lead me.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Manifested is something that has always been a central part of the three of our lives.  We all grew up together and played with each other and so many of our good friends every chance we had.  We played music during school, we played after school, we played at every party, coffee shop and gazebo within a 20 mile radius. Music has continued to be the most central aspect of our lives even as the venues became more legitimate. We went our separate ways and pursued music across the country in Vermont, Colorado, Massachusetts and California respectively.  When our paths realigned we had all become seasoned musicians. We gained an objective outlook on the challenges and heartbreak that can be a part of being in a band.  We learned how to operate both professionally and with artistic integrity. </p>
<p>This campaign is going to allow us to take the material we have been developing over the last two years and document it with the help of the wonderful ""Viking Sound"" recording team in the beautiful Pocono Mountains of Eastern PA.  Not only will we be able to have an album to share, to sell and to present the best face of the band, but we will get a new line of merch to support our time on the road.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>Wondering where exactly the funds are going? Here is the break down: We need $1200 in order to get the new album tracked ($600), mixed ($400) and mastered ($200). That is a SUPER good deal that we only got as a result of some friends/fans like yourselves giving us a huge break and returning some favors.  We will also be able to get a merch display case ($300), a new line of t-shirts ($500), a new line of pins ($300), our first line of hats ($400) and fund the physical production of the album ($300).</p>
<p>Every contribution comes with an advanced digital copy of the new album. You will have the opportunity to get the last of our old merch before it is gone forever, get first dibs on the new merch, get a signed album, choose songs for us to play at live shows, get an executive producer credit in the new album's liner notes, request a song for us to cover and even have the band play a show at your house or wash your car!  </p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal then all of your contributions will be returned.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The three of us have put a tremendous amount of time and energy into Manifested and are in the fortunate position to put in even more.  This campaign is about allowing us to record and support this new material. Your investment in this band is going to get the album made and also get a new line of merch that will bring us funding for years to come.  The momentum we have built brought us to some of the best festivals and venues on the east coast.  This plan will allow us to increase our time and effort to the point that it needs to be in order to take this project to the next level.  We will be able to play more shows in more markets and foster the growth that we all want to see!  We would be happy to play music in any capacity, but want to see how far we can take Manifested while we have the chance.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Playing in a band is something that brings a lot of joy to us, but it also comes with a lot of sacrifices.  The hours we have put in personally and together over the years are countless. We find ourselves with a set of skills that are truly unique.  Sharing them is what justifies it.   Playing music will always be a part of our lives, but we know the doors that are open for us now, are not going to be open forever.  To pass through them we need to do it together.  This funding will allow us to get the momentum we need to carry the project into the future and make bigger and more lasting strides. We truly appreciate playing music for you  and we hope that you can give us the opportunity to take Manifested to the next level.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute to this monetarily we understand.  There is still so much you can do to help us out!  Sharing this with you friends and family via email, Facebook or in person not only helps us reach our goal of raising $3000 but also includes those wonderful people in the communal experience we are all crafting together. That is Manifested.</p>

Playing in a band is something that brings a lot of joy to us, but it also comes with a lot of sacrifices.  The hours we have put in personally and together over the years are countless. We find ourselves with a set of skills that are truly unique.  Sharing them is what justifies it.   Playing music will always be a part of our lives, but we know the doors that are open for us now, are not going to be open forever.  To pass through them we need to do it together.  This funding will allow us to get the momentum we need to carry the project into the future and make bigger and more lasting strides. We truly appreciate playing music for you  and we hope that you can give us the opportunity to take Manifested to the next level.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't contribute to this monetarily we understand.  There is still so much you can do to help us out!  Sharing this with you friends and family via email, Facebook or in person not only helps us reach our goal of raising $3000 but also includes those wonderful people in the communal experience we are all crafting together. That is Manifested.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Joren de Bruin, though I often go by my artist name Tensei. I am an independent composer/producer and am probably best known for my work on the soundtrack for the webcomic Homestuck. I've written music in a wide variety of styles and genres and many of my tracks have received high praise from fans of the comic.</p>
<p>Back in 2011, I released an album called Strife, which to this day remains one of the most ""recommended listens"" of the entire Homestuck discography. Strife was an album that combined a foundation of hard rock/heavy metal with eclectic influences from videogames and anime soundtracks, all based around the common theme of 'battle music'. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478383399/hmlaklq153wweananonp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I've had many fans request some kind of follow-up to Strife, but was never able to get something off the ground due to the significant investment required in terms of both money and time. With crowdfunding I'll be able to dedicate most my time to making a great album, and bring it to a higher level of quality than would otherwise be possible.</p>
<p>By backing this project you express your support and desire to see the continued release of more music in the style of the first Strife album. Your support also opens up possibilities such as releases on physical media and high quality album art.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>The main limiting factor in creating Strife 2 has always been opportunity cost: an album of this scope requires multiple months of work and only makes money over a longer term after its release. By turning to crowdfunding, this investment is essentially front-loaded, which means that I can put all my time in creating the album instead of having to worry about making money to support myself.</p>
<p>Another part of it is musical equipment. My bass guitar and wah pedal need to be sent in for repairs, some of my samples need to be upgraded and new strings for my guitars are pretty much a constant expenditure. The money from this campaign will be used to upgrade and maintain my musical equipment, as well as pay collaborators/guest spots, which ensures that the quality of the album releases will be as good as it can be.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What You Get + Stretch Goals</h3>
<p><strong>Music</strong></p>
<p>Obviously! The Strife 2 album itself will have at least 12 tracks, making it twice as long as its predecessor. Perks for supporters also include other songs I've made previously. </p>
<p>The following preview video should provide a decent impression of the kinds of songs you can expect on the album. Note that all of these are works in progress and are therefore subject to changes in the final release.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pg5-LJLTiZg?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>

<div class=""""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y0fwjEr0GW0?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
</div>
<p>In addition to Strife 2, I have 2 more albums planned, details for which are listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Commissions</strong></p>
<p>To coincide with this campaign, will be offering a limited amount of special commissions at a significantly lower rate than usual, with a variety of options and pricing ranges available. More details on commissions are listed below.</p>
<p><strong>$5750 - Track Art</strong></p>
<p>With enough support I can afford to pay a professional artist to create track art and logo's for the album and give it a much higher level of polish and character. Marimo, the artist I have in mind is someone I've worked with multiple times in the past and whom I trust to deliver great quality. An example of her track art is shown below:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478268738/grq0u7habqeop1rra1y6.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>$6500 - The Noir Album</strong></p>
<p>A few months ago I posted a playful little jazzy tune called ""Long Night Ahead"", inspired by film noir, 90s point and click adventure games, and a certain other webcomic. The reception was amazingly positive, so the idea of turning it into an album was a tempting one. The Noir Album is still very much in its conceptual phase, but I am positive that I can turn it into something great. I'll be aiming for a similar scope as the Strife 2 album (12+ songs) but in a very different style, an example of which can be found in the music preview video.</p>
<p>If this stretch goal is reached, I am looking at the 12th of June, 2017 as a potential release date. </p>
<p><strong>8000$ - Physical Release - CD</strong></p>
<p>Even though physical media is on its way out, it's still nice to have something you can hold on to, right? Printed track art &amp; commentary booklet included. On reaching this stretch goal, any backers on a perk tier that includes the Digital release of Strife 2 can upgrade to a physical CD version (with shipping costs).</p>
<p><strong>14000$ - Heir of Grief Ultimate - Rework</strong></p>
<p>Heir of Grief stands out as arguably my most popular song on the Homestuck soundtrack, though I never was entirely satisfied with it, which makes a potential rework of it a tantalizing but ambitious goal. On reaching this stretch goal, I will be able to rent studio time and contract session musicians to deliver a fully live version of Heir of Grief that will blow every other Homestuck song I've ever made away.</p>
<p>The initial funding goal is my estimate of the required amount of money to be able to deliver Strife 2 by the date of March 14th, 2017, as well as the Commission compilation album (date of release depends on the number of commissions). If the funding does not meet the initial goal, both albums will be delayed as I will have to split my time working on the album with other projects. The amount of time by which the albums will be delayed depends on how much the funding falls short of the initial goal.</p>
<p><strong>16500$ - Physical Release - Vinyl</strong></p>
<p>Vinyl has kind of been in vogue again recently, right? Vinyl production costs are fairly high, and will require a separate remaster, which is why this is quite a pricey stretch goal. Both Strife 2 and the Noir Album will have a vinyl release if this goal is reached and will be available as a free upgrade for all $45 and up perks (but with associated shipping costs). </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Provided the funding is there, I foresee no risks that are likely to threaten the release of the albums, barring something happening to me personally. From experience, I am quite meticulous in keeping multiple backups of my projects nowadays, so even a simultaneous double hard drive failure shouldn't threaten the eventual release of the albums (though it might delay it).</p>
<p>Equipment failure is always a possibility as well, but the funding from this campaign should give me enough of a financial buffer to account for eventualities such as these.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Spread the word! Even if you can't afford to contribute, I know that a lot of people in the Homestuck fandom enjoy the music I've made, but might not necessarily connect it to my name. They might be eager to hear more and contribute to this campaign, so even getting the news out there helps.</p>
<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p><i><strong>Q: Is this an official Homestuck album?</strong></i></p>
<p><strong>A: No. What Pumpkin is not involved in the production of any part of this album.</strong></p>
<p><i><strong>Q: What about the Noir album, that name is kind of similar to...</strong></i></p>
<p><strong>A: It's based on Film Noir, a genre of movies from the 1930s-50s known for its hardboiled detectives and private eyes that get caught up in all manner of seedy shenanigans at the behest of some distressed broad. That's the kind of vibe you should expect from the album.</strong></p>
<p><i><strong>Q: You teased a potential 16/2/2017 release date to make it exactly 6 years since </strong><strong>the original release, what happened to that?</strong></i></p>
<p><b>A: It's more important to me that the album is good than to release it on an anniversary, and it's still quite possible that the album will be done by February the 16th. The 14/3/2017 release date is there to set an upper limit: the album will very definitely be released by then at the latest, but possibly earlier.</b></p>
<p><i><strong>Q: How are the prices for the commissions determined?</strong></i></p>
<p><strong>A: I usually do commissions in bulk/under contract for commercial projects (such as an entire soundtrack), which typically involves getting paid per minute of music delivered, as well as a percentage of sales (royalties). Commissions from the perks of this campaign are royalty-free and priced more attractively than my typical contract work, due to their limited nature. Additionally, you get all the albums and previous tier perk rewards as well.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Commission Terms and Details</h3>
<p><strong>Tier 1: Mini-Commissions, Non-Exclusive.</strong></p>
<p>In addition to Strife 2, I'll be creating a free compilation album made up out of backer commissions. I will take 1 day (24 hours) to work on each of these mini-commissions, with no specific limits placed on the number of instrument tracks, the genre or the duration of the track. As a backer on this tier, I will follow your request and make the track fit your specifications as closely as possible<strong>*</strong>. Additionally, I might live stream some of the creation process and, if desired, can provide a MIDI, an .flp file, or render it as separate mixer tracks for remixing/learning purposes. Commissions on this tier can incorporate motifs from existing songs or even be outright remixes, high quality rips or mash-ups. You are freely able to use these tracks in any non-commercial project.</p>
<p>Highbloods of the High Seas is an example of a track I've made in one day, and therefore gives a decent impression of the length and quality you can expect from a mini-commission.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/xdsecZAhMX8?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>*</strong><i>Within reason. There will be no revisions after a song is finished (i.e. the 24 hours are up). Although I will do my absolute best to produce something that fits the specifications, more outrageous or ambitious requests are more likely to go unfulfilled. Just use common sense when coming up with a request.</i>
</div>
<div> </div>
<p><strong>Tier 2: Mini-Commissions, Exclusively Licensed.</strong></p>
<p>Commissions on this tier follow the same specifications as Tier 1 (A song created in 24 hours), but will not be released on the compilation album (unless you so desire) and are instead exclusively for your own use (including commercial) without the need for royalty fees.</p>
<p><strong>Tier 3: Full Commission</strong></p>
<p>Unlike lower tiers, commissions from this tier aren't limited by what I can accomplish within 24 hours. This allows for a much greater level of polish and song complexity, though I am limiting myself to a maximum length of 2:30 per song. This is effectively the same kind of work I'd do under contract for soundtrack work, and that's the level of quality you can expect. These songs can also be used in your own commercial projects, with no royalty payments required!</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT: </strong>If you intend to use a track from Tier 2 or 3 in a commercial capacity (i.e. in a game that you intend to sell), <i>you take full responsibility for any copyright issues that might arise from requests to reuse/remix existing songs<i>. </i></i>That is to say, if you ask me to remix a Final Fantasy track, I can not be held accountable if you use this song in a game that you're selling and you get sued by Square-Enix. Generally, it is advisable to only request remixes of songs that you have legal ownership of, or are licensed to use.</p>

The money from this campaign will be used to upgrade and maintain my musical equipment, as well as pay collaborators/guest spots, which ensures that the quality of the album releases will be as good as it can be.
 
What You Get + Stretch Goals
Music
Obviously! The Strife 2 album itself will have at least 12 tracks, making it twice as long as its predecessor. Perks for supporters also include other songs I've made previously. 
The following preview video should provide a decent impression of the kinds of songs you can expect on the album. Note that all of these are works in progress and are therefore subject to changes in the final release.



 

In addition to Strife 2, I have 2 more albums planned, details for which are listed below.
Commissions
To coincide with this campaign, will be offering a limited amount of special commissions at a significantly lower rate than usual, with a variety of options and pricing ranges available. More details on commissions are listed below.
$5750 - Track Art
With enough support I can afford to pay a professional artist to create track art and logo's for the album and give it a much higher level of polish and character. Marimo, the artist I have in mind is someone I've worked with multiple times in the past and whom I trust to deliver great quality. An example of her track art is shown below:

$6500 - The Noir Album
A few months ago I posted a playful little jazzy tune called ""Long Night Ahead"", inspired by film noir, 90s point and click adventure games, and a certain other webcomic. The reception was amazingly positive, so the idea of turning it into an album was a tempting one. The Noir Album is still very much in its conceptual phase, but I am positive that I can turn it into something great. I'll be aiming for a similar scope as the Strife 2 album (12+ songs) but in a very different style, an example of which can be found in the music preview video.
If this stretch goal is reached, I am looking at the 12th of June, 2017 as a potential release date. 
8000$ - Physical Release - CD
Even though physical media is on its way out, it's still nice to have something you can hold on to, right? Printed track art & commentary booklet included. On reaching this stretch goal, any backers on a perk tier that includes the Digital release of Strife 2 can upgrade to a physical CD version (with shipping costs).
14000$ - Heir of Grief Ultimate - Rework
Heir of Grief stands out as arguably my most popular song on the Homestuck soundtrack, though I never was entirely satisfied with it, which makes a potential rework of it a tantalizing but ambitious goal. On reaching this stretch goal, I will be able to rent studio time and contract session musicians to deliver a fully live version of Heir of Grief that will blow every other Homestuck song I've ever made away.
The initial funding goal is my estimate of the required amount of money to be able to deliver Strife 2 by the date of March 14th, 2017, as well as the Commission compilation album (date of release depends on the number of commissions). If the funding does not meet the initial goal, both albums will be delayed as I will have to split my time working on the album with other projects. The amount of time by which the albums will be delayed depends on how much the funding falls short of the initial goal.
16500$ - Physical Release - Vinyl
Vinyl has kind of been in vogue again recently, right? Vinyl production costs are fairly high, and will require a separate remaster, which is why this is quite a pricey stretch goal. Both Strife 2 and the Noir Album will have a vinyl release if this goal is reached and will be available as a free upgrade for all $45 and up perks (but with associated shipping costs). 
 

Risks & Challenges
Provided the funding is there, I foresee no risks that are likely to threaten the release of the albums, barring something happening to me personally. From experience, I am quite meticulous in keeping multiple backups of my projects nowadays, so even a simultaneous double hard drive failure shouldn't threaten the eventual release of the albums (though it might delay it).
Equipment failure is always a possibility as well, but the funding from this campaign should give me enough of a financial buffer to account for eventualities such as these.
 

Other Ways You Can Help
Spread the word! Even if you can't afford to contribute, I know that a lot of people in the Homestuck fandom enjoy the music I've made, but might not necessarily connect it to my name. They might be eager to hear more and contribute to this campaign, so even getting the news out there helps.
FAQ
Q: Is this an official Homestuck album?
A: No. What Pumpkin is not involved in the production of any part of this album.
Q: What about the Noir album, that name is kind of similar to...
A: It's based on Film Noir, a genre of movies from the 1930s-50s known for its hardboiled detectives and private eyes that get caught up in all manner of seedy shenanigans at the behest of some distressed broad. That's the kind of vibe you should expect from the album.
Q: You teased a potential 16/2/2017 release date to make it exactly 6 years since the original release, what happened to that?
A: It's more important to me that the album is good than to release it on an anniversary, and it's still quite possible that the album will be done by February the 16th. The 14/3/2017 release date is there to set an upper limit: the album will very definitely be released by then at the latest, but possibly earlier.
Q: How are the prices for the commissions determined?
A: I usually do commissions in bulk/under contract for commercial projects (such as an entire soundtrack), which typically involves getting paid per minute of music delivered, as well as a percentage of sales (royalties). Commissions from the perks of this campaign are royalty-free and priced more attractively than my typical contract work, due to their limited nature. Additionally, you get all the albums and previous tier perk rewards as well.
 
 
Commission Terms and Details
Tier 1: Mini-Commissions, Non-Exclusive.
In addition to Strife 2, I'll be creating a free compilation album made up out of backer commissions. I will take 1 day (24 hours) to work on each of these mini-commissions, with no specific limits placed on the number of instrument tracks, the genre or the duration of the track. As a backer on this tier, I will follow your request and make the track fit your specifications as closely as possible*. Additionally, I might live stream some of the creation process and, if desired, can provide a MIDI, an .flp file, or render it as separate mixer tracks for remixing/learning purposes. Commissions on this tier can incorporate motifs from existing songs or even be outright remixes, high quality rips or mash-ups. You are freely able to use these tracks in any non-commercial project.
Highbloods of the High Seas is an example of a track I've made in one day, and therefore gives a decent impression of the length and quality you can expect from a mini-commission.

 

*Within reason. There will be no revisions after a song is finished (i.e. the 24 hours are up). Although I will do my absolute best to produce something that fits the specifications, more outrageous or ambitious requests are more likely to go unfulfilled. Just use common sense when coming up with a request.

 
Tier 2: Mini-Commissions, Exclusively Licensed.
Commissions on this tier follow the same specifications as Tier 1 (A song created in 24 hours), but will not be released on the compilation album (unless you so desire) and are instead exclusively for your own use (including commercial) without the need for royalty fees.
Tier 3: Full Commission
Unlike lower tiers, commissions from this tier aren't limited by what I can accomplish within 24 hours. This allows for a much greater level of polish and song complexity, though I am limiting myself to a maximum length of 2:30 per song. This is effectively the same kind of work I'd do under contract for soundtrack work, and that's the level of quality you can expect. These songs can also be used in your own commercial projects, with no royalty payments required!
IMPORTANT: If you intend to use a track from Tier 2 or 3 in a commercial capacity (i.e. in a game that you intend to sell), you take full responsibility for any copyright issues that might arise from requests to reuse/remix existing songs. That is to say, if you ask me to remix a Final Fantasy track, I can not be held accountable if you use this song in a game that you're selling and you get sued by Square-Enix. Generally, it is advisable to only request remixes of songs that you have legal ownership of, or are licensed to use.

</div><div>Negura Bunget has always been a live band. In our 20 years history we played more than 1000 gigs, with more than 500 performed over the last years. Most of our tours are self produced and self financed. That means we pretty much do all the work ourselves. We don't have a booking agent or manager, we do all the work ourselves. While this approach gives of a lot of freedom to do things the way we see them fit, it also comes with some limitations.
<p>We have no problem driving thousand of miles by van, sleeping in motels and eating whatever we can find. We enjoy getting to new places and meeting new people.</p>
<p>Still, we are a underground band from Romania and there is just so much we can do on our own. But we are up to the challenge. We already have a European tour setup for Autumn 2016 and a North American on for spring 2017. With a bit of help our plan is to extend the tour in Australia, New Zealand, India, China and Japan. If things go well, maybe even more countries.</p>
<p>We have the connections to make this possible, we just need to face some high upfront costs (flights, visas, rentals, insurances), most of which we'll never recuperate.<br/><br/></p>

We're applying for 9000 $ for this project. Those money will help us cover things such as visas, flight costs, van rentals and hotel bookings. 
When supporting Negura Bunget, you can get your hands on some very unique items. Rare items from our private collections, signed products, special items for this campaign, interaction with the band  and many other interesting perks. 
The more funds we manage to raise, the more options we have with the tour planning. We'd love to extend it as much as possible and include some more countries in the area (like Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, South Korea...).Challanges
Negura Bunget has always been a live band. In our 20 years history we played more than 1000 gigs, with more than 500 performed over the last years. Most of our tours are self produced and self financed. That means we pretty much do all the work ourselves. We don't have a booking agent or manager, we do all the work ourselves. While this approach gives of a lot of freedom to do things the way we see them fit, it also comes with some limitations.
We have no problem driving thousand of miles by van, sleeping in motels and eating whatever we can find. We enjoy getting to new places and meeting new people.
Still, we are a underground band from Romania and there is just so much we can do on our own. But we are up to the challenge. We already have a European tour setup for Autumn 2016 and a North American on for spring 2017. With a bit of help our plan is to extend the tour in Australia, New Zealand, India, China and Japan. If things go well, maybe even more countries.
We have the connections to make this possible, we just need to face some high upfront costs (flights, visas, rentals, insurances), most of which we'll never recuperate.

Negura Bunget ZI albumZI (in English ""say"" or ""day"" is the second part of the Transilvanian Trilogy, the most complex musical and visual project we've ever been working on as a band.The album explores the human components, the traditions and
practices, the connection with the nature, the way this relation shaped the
spiritual horizon of the local inhabitants. The second stage of the trilogy is
symbolized through WORD.Negura Bunget ZI Anniversary World Tour

<p>Well...yes! International travel can be financially challenging for anyone, but for musicians, the added expense of transporting our instruments takes matters from ""challenging"" to ""really complicated"" rather quickly! Large instruments such as Adaiha's viol and my cello (better known as ""Gracie"") require a seat on an airplane, necessitating the purchase of a second, full-price fare in addition to our individual tickets. Needless to say, things can get expensive quickly---and that without even factoring-in other essentials such as meals and lodging!</p>
<p>To that end, we are asking for your help in raising $5,000 to help offset our travel expenses. Your contribution will help pay for plane tickets for both performers and their instruments---and keep us happily fed and housed while we are on the road!</p>
<p>As a gesture of our gratitude for your donation, we are offering an assortment of perks ranging all the way from a handwritten postcard from Finland to the opportunity to have us record a special bonus track inspired by our BRQ Vantaa Festival program just for you. Also available is the opportunity to get your hands on one of the first copies of my upcoming debut album---<i>Entrez le Diable!</i>---which features several of the works we will be performing in Finland. For those of you who cannot join us in Vantaa, it's the next best thing to being in the audience!</p>

Dear Romanians and supporters of Romanian culture!
Under the umbrella and with the support of the Romanian-American Society of Washington State, our own community organization, I am thrilled to announce the Benaroya Hall Chamber Concert in Romanian Character that will take place on September 12th, 2015 at 7:30 PM. I  will be joined by distinguished Seattle Symphony's Principal Second violinist, Elisa Barston and Seattle Opera's own soloist soprano, Marcy Stonikas who is also a soloist with the Folksoper in Vienna. 


If you love Romanian music and culture this concert is for you! Our concert is titled 'in Romanian Character' for a reason: we are bringing to you a musical program that transforms the musical soul of Romanians, our folk music, into classical masterworks. You will recognize Romanian dances and songs whose rhythms, fire or lyricism you will enjoy.



Elisa, Marcy and I are confident that you will appreciate the exquisitely elegant environment at Benaroya Hall, fantastic acoustics, pleasant seats, the whole experience of a September night that aims to make Romanian culture well known in Seattle and bring all of us closer together.



Our goal is to raise $6500 which will cover the artists fees, hall rental+ insurance+ ushers, piano tuning and the in-hall video recording. We hope you will enjoy the multitude of rewards that come with each donation level!


All of us at the Romanian-American Society of Washington State would like to send you our HUGE gratitude. We'd like to applaud you, the supporters, sponsors and founders of this first big scale Romanian concert at Benaroya Hall!


We'd like to ask you to please SHARE this kickstarter campaign with all your friends and relatives so we can reach as many Romanians and Romanian culture friends as possible.



Thank you for your generosity and I can't wait to see you at the concert!

THAILAND!</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>The Short Story</strong></p>
<p>As Boston-based Irish music duo <a href=""http://www.mattandshannonheaton.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Matt &amp; Shannon Heaton</a>, we perform updated and traditional music around the globe. We’ve got four duo CDs to date.</p>
<p>We’re raising money to help record our fifth duo album, “Tell You in Earnest” and then to do our first CD Release concert for the album in... Suphanburi, Thailand.</p>
<p><strong>Wait… What? Thailand?</strong></p>
<p>Before we spent our  time traveling to Ireland to play tunes and songs, there was Suphanburi, the Thai village where Shannon spent her first year in college. She was taken in by the Thai music crowd there and learned of the power of being part of a community dedicated to a tradition much bigger and older than any one person. (She also learned to speak Thai fluently. Go ahead: ask her to say something in Thai!)</p>
<p>In February we will bring things full circle round and launch our newest CD in Suphanburi: we’ll play a free concert for our generous community, since that's the Thai way. And to help other kids who are finding their voice through traditional music, we'll send 10% of funds raised to the Thai music and dance program at Bangkok’s <a href=""http://www.mercycentre.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mercy Centre</a>, a home for some of the poorest kids in Thailand.</p>
<p>With your help, we'll take our music back to where Shannon first got the trad music bug. (This time around, we’ll have plenty of mosquito repellent…).</p>
<p><strong>What we need</strong></p>
<p>We’re raising money to defray travel costs. If we reach that goal, we'll up our target amount to cover CD production/manufacture. 10% of the money we raise will go to the Mercy Centre.</p>
<p><strong>What we’re offering</strong></p>
<p>In exchange for your support to unite trad musicians and music lovers across the globe, we also have <strong>imaginative, exotic, exclusive gifts of gratitude</strong>, including:</p>
<p>MUSIC: CDs, exclusive collections, songbooks, lessons, compositions</p>
<p>KID STUFF: coloring posters, songbooks, CDs, toys from Thailand</p>
<p>EXOTIC THAI TREATS: secret family recipes, Shannon's ""Guide to Ordering in Thai Restaurants,"" Thai textiles, postcards from the Kingdom, field trip to a Thai restaurant with Shannon</p>
<p><strong>More on the new CD:</strong><strong><br/><br/></strong>This Fall, we will record our fifth duo CD, “Tell You in Earnest.” We are calling this a collection of ""Dialog Ballads."" Basically, each song isa 2-character short play, and the action is driven along by conversation. Some of these conversations are juicy, some are heartbreaking, some are just weird.<br/></p>
<p>When the album comes out in February, we will perform a free CD Release show in Suphanburi for Shannon's beloved mentors and our dear friends. We will talk about the stories in the songs and compare them to favorite Thai stories, demonstrating universal song themes, celebrating cultural differences. Matt will play beautifully and say hello and thank you. Shannon will do the rest of the talking in Thai.</p>
<p><strong>Why we are asking for money:</strong></p>
<p>The tour in Thailand and making the album are considerable expenses; and the special concert in Suphanburi will be a free concert for the community there. Therefore the album and travel costs will not be covered by this gig, or the other gigs we have lined up in Thailand.</p>
<p>So, we need help with recording and travel costs. And while we’re at it, we’ll send 10% of the money to the kids at Bangkok's <a href=""http://www.mercycentre.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mercy Centre</a>. They’ve got a growing Thai traditional music and dance program that Irish music’s own Mick Moloney has helped to build. We believe in the transcendent power of traditional music to unite and empower participants of all levels and ages. And it will be our honor and privilege to offer financial support to the Mercy Centre.</p>
<p>A side benefit of asking for money is that we get to share our story and our process with you. It takes a village… in this case, several! We hope you will be excited to invest in this album—and the CD launch in Suphanburi. With your support, we will build a bridge between three distinct traditional music communities: America, Ireland, and Thailand.</p>
<p>Traditional music really is an international language. This is community-based music, and we are grateful to have the support of such beautiful, diverse communities. Thank you for your support.</p>
<p><strong>Money will help... so will spreading the word!</strong><strong><br/><br/></strong>If this is a lean time for you, we are grateful for any word-of-mouth support! PLEASE SHARE THIS WITH YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY. Spread the word about Matt &amp; Shannon Heaton and our fabulous funding campaign, which will also help the kids at The Mercy Centre!<br/></p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","SEND OUR IRISH TRAD MUSIC forged in America BACK to...

Highly committed to creating a spectacle, this 20-piece big band plays contemporary music by some of the UK’s finest young composers and improvisers including Laura Jurd, Elliot Galvin, Alex Roth and Simon Marsh amongst others. With a passion for new music this hard hitting, cross-genre ensemble is reminiscent of the eighties powerhouse ‘Loose Tubes’, whilst developing a truly unique, ever-evolving identity of its own.</p>

</h3><p>Hi!  I am a 17-year old Christian singer/songwriter from a small town in Wyoming.  I have sung, danced and acted my whole life, but in 2012, I released my first album of original music and have been traveling as a ""musicianary"" ever since.  I have had some incredible experiences as I have traveled, and God has blessed me with an awesome family support system and new artist and music industry friends who have encouraged me in my dreams...to continue writing, singing and traveling to share the songs He has placed on my heart and to bring them to a city near YOU!<br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>A New Album In The Works: <br/>
</h3><p>The experiences that I have singing and being in ministry over the last 4 years have really helped me to figure out who I am, what my ""style"" is musically and the things about which I am passionate and want to write.   My new songs are a good representation of this, and we decided it was about time to put these onto a new album.  Some of the 11 songs on this album were written about friend or family situations...like one is a song that I wrote to sing at a friend's wedding.  Another song is one I wrote when good friends of ours on the mission field tragically lost a family member.  Some are songs I have written when I was struggling in relationships, or just down right struggling about life in general.  Some songs are simply worshiping my Lord, and I hope they ALL bring Him glory and honor.  He is the reason that I sing!  Everything in my life - love, sorrow, trials, joy, celebrations - everything is an opportunity to worship Him through my music.  That's just the way He wired me, and I hope I use it to bring Him joy and enjoyment to all of YOU. <br/></p><p>Through the blessing of technology, we have been able to stay here in Wyoming while we record in Nashville - how cool is THAT?  Financially,
we have gotten my album to the point of having almost all of the songs started
in the studio with various producers, engineers and session players.  I am privileged to work with some of the most amazing people in Nashville:  Eric Copeland, Producer and President of Creative Soul Records; Producer/Engineer Steve Dady of Sunset Blvd Studios has done all my tracking sessions, and Jonathan Crone - Musician/Producer/Engineer - is putting his touch on many of them and more to come.  Session musicians include the greats in Nashville such as guitarist Dave Cleveland, drummer Steve Brewster, bassists Gary Lunn and Danny O'Lannerty, pianist Blair Masters...I am beyond in awe of their talents and cannot WAIT to officially meet them! <br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>How YOU Can Help Me:<br/>
</h3>I am putting my fundraiser limit at $10,000, and praying for God to bless this project with even more as He sees fit and if it be in His will, in Jesus' Name.  Here is the breakdown of what I actually need financially to continue, to go out to Nashville in July to record my vocals, and to hopefully get this album out by the fall when I will start to travel even more to share my music:<br/><br/>-Production expenses: approximately $8,900 <br/>-Photos/Design for album: $1,650 <br/>-Hair &amp; Makeup for album photo session: $250<br/>-CD Duplication, 1,000 CDs, 6-panel: $1,500<br/>-Travel expenses to Nashville and back: approximately $700<br/><br/>BUT it's not just about the money!  I really need your prayer support and your encouragement, so besides donating, please join my team by:<br/><br/>-FOLLOWING ME on Facebook, Instagram &amp; Twitter<br/>-Praying for WISDOM and DIRECTION as we complete this project, for SAFETY in our travels and for GUIDANCE in our bookings, and for ME as I write new songs, that I would listen to the words HE speaks to me<br/>-CONTACTING ME at my booking tab on my website if you have an event or venue where I can come help you in ministry<br/>-SPREADING THE WORD about this project<br/><br/>Places you can connect with me on social media so that you can share this project:<br/><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/skylarkaylyn"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.facebook.com/skylarkaylyn</a><br/><a href=""http://www.skylarkaylyn.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.skylarkaylyn.com</a><br/><a href=""http://www.twitter.com/SkylarKaylyn"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.twitter.com/SkylarKaylyn</a><br/><a href=""http://www.instagram.com/skylarkmuzic"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.instagram.com/skylarkmuzic</a><br/><br/><b></b><h3>What You Get In Return:</h3>My eternal gratitude, for one thing!  But also, here are just a few of the special things I'd like to give you once our project is funded and completed.  <br/><br/><b><i>My new poster:</i></b><br/><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/613058/files/20140529163418-Poster.JPG?1401406458"" src="""" style=""width: 394.529px;

<p>As writers, musicians and artists, we put our blood, sweat and tears into our work. Yet we often give away the result just to get credit. We post our artwork on blogs, upload our music to online communities and give away our poems to nonpaying publications. We also perform or display our work at public events with no financial gain.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the economic strain drives many talented people away from creative work—especially in places like our rural community. Here, creativity is not only undervalued, it is discouraged. Self-expression has been reduced to brand names and sports logos. Our grandparents’ farm land is now a fast-food haven. In many ways, we are homogenized America, with our minimum-wage jobs and chain stores offering the same made-in-China landfill fodder. Our value is not in what we ourselves produce or create, but in what we buy—and how much. We are no longer citizens, but consumers.</p>
<h3><strong>Our Mission</strong></h3>
<p>We are working to fight the forces of creative oppression in our community. That’s why we started the Homegrown Art, Music &amp; Spoken Word Show, an open-mic and arts exhibition series held bimonthly in Bullitt County, Kentucky. Our mission is to nurture local writers, musicians and fine artists by providing a platform to showcase their talents. And we accomplished part of that mission May 17 at our pilot show at Cedar Grove Coffee House.</p>
<p>If you were among the folks who packed the coffee shop that evening, then you witnessed something special—a magical blend of both budding poets and musicians, as well as more accomplished artists and artisans. We had a terrific time, and the energy we created lifted our spirits and our hopes to transform the culture of our community. We believe that art should not be free! Artists and artisans should be rewarded for their efforts and fostered to their full potential.</p>
<h3><strong>Make a Difference</strong></h3>
<p>We believe we can overcome creative oppression by rewarding the efforts of local artists and artisans and fostering them to their full potential. Funding for this campaign will go toward:</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We started this band less than a year ago with the hope of creating something great enough to share. After teaming up with some amazing people, we've finally gotten the chance to do that; and here we are. </p>
<p>This Indiegogo is the last vital piece to our dream. With help from people as passionate about this as we are, we can put the finishing touches on what we've been working so hard on and share it with the masses. Having put everything we own (or owned) on the line for this, we're now reaching out for that last bit of help to make things happen.</p>
<p>With your contribution, no matter how big or small; we'll be able to finalize this full length record that we've put our entire lives into. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Making an amazing sounding record is both time consuming and exponentially more expensive than you'd think. To put things into perspective, here's what it costs:</p>
<p>Recording &amp; Production - $9,000</p>
<p>Mastering - $1500</p>
<p>CD Replication - $2000</p>
<p>Merchandise - $2000</p>
<p>So, clearly this is a lot more than we're asking for from you guys. We've saved money from our jobs, selling personal items, and living off of bulk ramen noodles just to make this work. The last $5000 will cover our finishing fees and the first run of merch that we can send out to our fans!</p>
<p>If you choose to back us, your donation will score you something awesome.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>For us, this is the biggest milestone in our lives. We've been striving to make great music; and now that we have, we just need that last little push to help share it with everyone. With your donations, you'll help make the dreams of four extremely motivated people come to fruition - and we won't let you down. </p>
<p>We've been lucky enough to have some of the greatest people we know involved in this project. Starting with pre-production by Cody Payne (The Dangerous Summer/Hopeless Records), and now producer Paul Leavitt (All Time Low/Senses Fail/etc.), we've got the expertise and experience to fine tune everything we've already done ourselves. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't afford to contribute, you can still help! As a new band, exposure is really the first battle towards getting out there. If you can tell a few friends and they tell a few friends, we'll have that many more people aware of what we're doing. </p>
<p>If you're into social media, share our Facebook/Instagram/Twitter pages to people that might like us. Any and all help is greatly appreciated!</p></span></span></span></span></div>","Short Summary

<p><b>That was Piano! Push Play!, a music outreach project, with one mission, to give everyone more access to this beautiful instrument.  We want it to be easier for everyone to play, listen and enjoy the piano. We believe performing for others in a casual setting is a key community practice for any musician. Through this project we saw the piano bringing together people from all walks of life, sparking conversations and communion amongst strangers, fostering those that aim to make a life in music and helping to bring a bit of joy, magic and MUSIC to everyone's day. </b></p>
<p><b> Throughout this summer we had 5 pianos outside on the streets of Portland, free for the public to play.  And PLAY! they did. There was barely ever a period of more than 5 minutes when one of our pianos wasn't being played. </b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/116887/files/20131006172905-531821_930655542091_1616239702_n.jpg?1381105745"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Now that the rainy season is upon us we want to find permanant homes for these 5 pianos. We want to donate to places in this city that will serve children, at risk-youth and spaces where the entire community can have year-round access to a piano to play, practice or write music on and share their music with others. Places like King School in N Portland, New Avenues for Youth and ADX, a community space and workshop. </b></p>
<p><b>To accomplish this goal and bring this project full circle</b><i><b> your help! </b></i></p>
<p><b>We need to raise the funds to re-tune, service and move these pianos so that we can donate them to a permanent home. We also want to provide each new location with their first follow-up tuning and maintenance. </b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/116888/files/20131006172948-1146457_930659678801_182727549_n.jpg?1381105788"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Throughout this summer we organized lots of free concerts where young, locally-based pianists performed for the pubic in these exciting outdoor spaces. We discovered so many talented and emerging pianists and composers that live in this city and wish it was easier to play for people and with other musicians and singers.  </b><b>W</b><b>e want to create more access to this instrument for everyone so players can share their gift with the community and inspire others to get involved in music. </b></p>
<p><b>As a big part of our reward system we want to tap into all this local talent of incredible pianists and produce an album of their favorite piano pieces; from jazz to classical to original compositions. For many this will be their first opportunity to be professionally recorded and they couldn't be more excited!  We will produce a beautifully hand illustrated booklet with our physical C.D. profiling each pianist, why they picked each piece, their connection with the music/piano and an experience they had through this project. </b></p>

If you want to see more amazing photos from this summer or read some of the lovely stories and comments we received please visit our Facebook....Indiegogo receives so much support from word of mouth so please share our story with others or submit your own. 
Facebook



That was Piano! Push Play!, a music outreach project, with one mission, to give everyone more access to this beautiful instrument.  We want it to be easier for everyone to play, listen and enjoy the piano. We believe performing for others in a casual setting is a key community practice for any musician. Through this project we saw the piano bringing together people from all walks of life, sparking conversations and communion amongst strangers, fostering those that aim to make a life in music and helping to bring a bit of joy, magic and MUSIC to everyone's day. 
 Throughout this summer we had 5 pianos outside on the streets of Portland, free for the public to play.  And PLAY! they did. There was barely ever a period of more than 5 minutes when one of our pianos wasn't being played. 



Now that the rainy season is upon us we want to find permanant homes for these 5 pianos. We want to donate to places in this city that will serve children, at risk-youth and spaces where the entire community can have year-round access to a piano to play, practice or write music on and share their music with others. Places like King School in N Portland, New Avenues for Youth and ADX, a community space and workshop. 
To accomplish this goal and bring this project full circle your help! 
We need to raise the funds to re-tune, service and move these pianos so that we can donate them to a permanent home. We also want to provide each new location with their first follow-up tuning and maintenance. 



Throughout this summer we organized lots of free concerts where young, locally-based pianists performed for the pubic in these exciting outdoor spaces. We discovered so many talented and emerging pianists and composers that live in this city and wish it was easier to play for people and with other musicians and singers.  We want to create more access to this instrument for everyone so players can share their gift with the community and inspire others to get involved in music. 
As a big part of our reward system we want to tap into all this local talent of incredible pianists and produce an album of their favorite piano pieces; from jazz to classical to original compositions. For many this will be their first opportunity to be professionally recorded and they couldn't be more excited!  We will produce a beautifully hand illustrated booklet with our physical C.D. profiling each pianist, why they picked each piece, their connection with the music/piano and an experience they had through this project. 



 smaller donations are super important and cover a whole host of things.

I really can't say THANK YOU!!! enough to everyone who helped this project be such a success this summer. From piano movers, to piano players, to total strangers who gave me such generous hugs and played their hearts out.  Let's complete the circle and give all these pianos another generation of use, LOVE, and beautiful music making. MUSIC FOR EVERYBODY. 

Risks and challenges
Recording and producing records can be a long process with unforeseen delays. I will do my absolute darnedest to get our C.D and other rewards to you by this Christmas.....they are the perfect gift for that musician in your life after all!
There are risks and challenges in any big undertaking but I couldn't have had better sponsors and support than the following organizations

<p>Hello! My name is Matthew Linaman and I am a cellist. I recently graduated from the San Francisco Conservatory of Music and I am committed to bridging diversity and connecting humanity through inspired learning and music making. </p>
<p>As I am on the rise on my international career, I am in need
of a more dynamic instrument. I need a cello that has an endless palate of
sounds and colors to connect with a global population with endless diversity. I
was not expecting to have found “the one” so soon out of school, but after
playing on this cello for just a few days, I discovered it has the unique power to
connect to anybody, and to move every body out of their seats and into
inspiration. </p>
<p>I love this cello. It not only inspires me to practice, it inspires me to play better! It forces me to stretch everyday to it's great potential- to bring my best self to practice and performing, and to bring the best music I can to audiences. This cello will give me a competitive edge in competitions, auditions and will take me throughout my entire career .</p>
<p>I am doing everything in my power to fund this cello. I am only three months out of school and I have
a full concert schedule in the fall and many appearances in the spring
including being the Featured Soloist with the Oakland East Bay Symphony and an
international tour with my string quartet, the CelloStreet Quartet. I teach a
vibrant studio of students and I coach at several local schools. I get inspired
when I can help others be inspired. That is why I love performing and teaching.
I want to see inspired faces and shining eyes after my recitals and after my
lessons. And it may not be because of how beautifully I did or didn’t play, it
is because we realize the power of music- it allows us to transcend our
differences and unite into an inspired collective where amazing things can
happen. </p>
<p>So you must be wondering- what is this cello?! So I will
tell you! This cello comes from a family of 19<sup>th</sup> Century French
luthiers named the Chanot Family. It has superb craftsmanship and it in
exquisite condition. However it is missing the maker’s label, a crucial part in
the determination of the price. After having played 20 different cellos to
confirm that the Chanot cello is the one, and after multiple professional
feedback,  it is clear that the Chanot is
a rare gem, that with a label, could go for 2-3 times as much. The lack of the
label does not affect the sound of course and it does not effect the power it
has to move people. </p>
<p>I am using this indiegogo campaign as a platform to fund
this cello. I am maintaining my private studio, coaching at local schools, and
booking more and more concerts. The world needs to hear this cello. </p>
<p>If you can’t contribute, please send this message to your
friends, classmates, co-workers and relatives. Even if they can’t contribute,  by getting my message out you are helping my
mission of making more classical music global. </p>
<p>I have set this campaign up so that I will receive all funds
donated- and they will go straight to funding the cello. If there are
additional funds, I will take a poll and decide to donate a portion to charity
or local music school program. </p>

<h3 class=""western""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica,serif;"">Music? For Development? Why?</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: Helvetica,serif;"">All over the world there are communities with great ideas about ways to improve their quality of life, but many of them face financial barriers to putting these ideas into action. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Helvetica,serif;"">These vibrant communities often perform amazing, unique music as part of everyday life.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Helvetica,serif;"">Community Voice International is a nonprofit startup that sees music as a local resource which can be transformed into an asset to fund local development. By recording local music, selling the recordings online, and returning the proceeds back to the community of origin, we seek to generate seed funding to catalyze local development efforts. Because the cost of living is lower in our partner communities, a recording doesn't have to sell a million copies to make a difference—in fact, some projects can be funded by less than 100 downloads.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Helvetica,serif;"">I'm David Bleckley, the founder of Community Voice International. I served in the Peace Corps in a small village in Senegal, West Africa. During my service, I took great joy in the music that permeated every facet of daily life, but I was also troubled by how difficult it was for the community to save up even $250 to fund projects that would dramatically improve community members' quality of life. Over the past several years, I developed the idea to transform local music into funds for local development efforts—an idea that became Community Voice International.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Helvetica,serif;"">Over the past year, a small group of us created Community Voice and have been piloting this idea with Joshua, a Peace Corps Volunteer in Senegal. We have recorded music in two communities and will be releasing those recordings soon. Throughout the process we have identified ways to make the project better. Now, the time has come to scale up our project and expand our scope.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Helvetica,serif;""><em>Music for Development</em></span><span style=""font-family: Helvetica,serif;""> is phase two of our pilot project. In April 2013, I will travel to Senegal to record music in at least seven more partner communities (we may be able to record several more, depending on funding and partnership interest). The project will be a collaboration with Joshua and other Peace Corps Volunteers as well as staff and volunteers from Tostan, a fantastic organization which trains and mobilizes communities to identify and plan local development efforts. These collaborators help Community Voice create relationships with communities which have plans for community development projects, barriers to complete these efforts, and an interest in working with Community Voice to transform local music into a development funding source. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Helvetica,serif;"">Your support for this campaign will allow Community Voice International to become a reality and more importantly, will create a new stream of income to fund local development in our partner communities. </span></p>

Bonus music from Adam Klein: From now until the end of the campaign for any new contribution of $100 or more, singer/songwriter, Returned Peace Corps Volunteer, and Community Voice Board Member Adam Klein is offering up two of his most recently relased CDs:

Malian music album Dugu Wolo, recorded in Bamako, Mali and featuring traditional West African instrumentation by some of Mali's master musicians

The new Americana/folk album Sky Blue DeVille

Adam is offering these in addition to the other incentives you will also receive at this level. Thank you for your generosity, Adam!
The Impact
The main goal of this project will be recording music from partner communities to sell online in order to fund local development work. Stay tuned for updates to find out the communities in which we'll be working and what projects they have planned. 
Beyond realizing the mission of transforming music into funds for development, this campaign will also support Community Voice's work, allowing us to:


Streamline our recording process;


Experiment with different kinds of equipment to determine what works the best in the field;


And most importantly, to talk with members of our partner communities to find out how our work can better facilitate their development efforts.

Community Voice is pushing forward as an organization, trying to become more sustainable and effective at what we do. Your support will help us to prove that the concept of recording local music to fund local development really works. That proof of concept will allow us to help thousands of people in the years to come.

Some of the old songs can be checked from the video medley on this page.<br/>We'll hit the studio in May and release for the album is planned for late summer or early autumn.<br/>We have released two demo CD's so far. A Familiar Room was released in 2011 and Apparition of Ending was released in 2012. Prints weren't that big, only 100 to 150 each. <br/>Promoting everything by ourselves is tough work. Now we have support from Inverse Records, but we still need support for funding the studio, promotion and releasing the album. That's really important for us.With this support we'll have the opportunity to release this record as planned and in return everyone gets an album full of great metal of death.</p>

EPHEBIA FESTIVAL 2013: WE NEED YOU!
Ephebia Festival, the musical event which, from 15 years, brings the best of the italian and international emergent music to the center of Terni, for everyone and absolutely free.
 
Ephebia Association is made entirely of volunteers and it has always put in the first place our city, Terni, and its musicians, making everyone of them play during the Festival's days, whose stage has seen bands like Afterhours, Porcupine Tree, Linea 77, The Ark, LNRipley, Zen Circus, Bud Spencer Blues Explosion, Il Teatro Degli Orrori and many others.
However, volunteers can't do much without some financial aid from the government or from our fans, and for this reason now we need you.
We don't ask for much, just what we need to sustain some expenses and maybe to have that little bonus which will allow us to book that artist whom you like so much. Obviously, though, it wouldn't be in our spirit to ask for something without giving something else in return!  For this reason, depending on how much you'll want to donate, you'll have a gift, something as a token of our gratitude towards you, because if we're doing Ephebia 2013 and it'll be sensational...it will be also because of you!
 
WHAT WE NEED, WHAT WE CAN GIVE YOU
 
We at Ephebia have always organized the festival with government funds. In the last years, however, the recent financial cuts to culture led to great cuts to the funds for our event. For this reason your help is now essential for our festival. 1500 € will allow us to create a memorable festival, in the beautiful location of Anfiteatro Fausto in Terni.
What we can give in exchange, apart from our biggest efforts to organize the best festival possible, are small prizes which mean a lot to us: gadgets, pins, memorabilia from past editions, t-shirts.
The perks list will be updated frequently every time the bands will give their willingness to share with us some of their merchandise...or, who knows, maybe also some of their time!
 
THE IMPACT
The past edition saw thousands of people filling the Anfiteatro to its limits. People who, together with the bands and us, created the magical atmosphere which has characterized our Festival in 15 years. This year your help is going to make the difference. Don't let all this get lost (Like tears in the rain) because of some harsh austerity policies.

<h3>HELLO!</h3>
<p>My name is <strong>Meia</strong>, and I have been writing songs, playing guitar and singing for about 15 years now- but... I've never recorded a CD. I would like to have recorded at least ONE CD in my lifetime. I put a piece of my soul in each song I write. People tell me I am incredibly talented, and that it's a shame I have no CD's to sell or leave as my legacy. So I am running this campaign to remedy that situation.</p>
<p><strong>Why a campaign?</strong></p>
<p>Because performing music is what I do for a living. If you are not a musician, you may not realize, it doesn't pay much... and merchandise are expensive investments. I DO have bills to pay, which take priority and that is why I need to raise funds online. Also, I don't have the skill or equipment to do the home studio thing, and the quality of my recordings matter to me, as my fans will be paying for this product.</p>
<p>My website is <a href=""http://www.rebelwithasixstring.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.rebelwithasixstring.com</a></p>
<p>I do all my accounting, booking, taxes, instrument maintenance...etc. I basically run my own business. I'm not trying to be rich or famous, I just want to continue to do what I love and not have to ""live to work"" at a dead end meaningless job I hate. </p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What I Need </span></strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>I need about $1,000 to get started, but my kickstarter failed at 650, so I'm shooting for 700 this time, and if I make more that's fantastic!! If not, I will have a good startup amount. I have a studio in mind, and this gentleman is from England... he has a private analog studio just outside of town, the gas to get there and back is going to be expensive, and I need to pay him for his time of course. I also have a friend willing to help produce and provide live recordings for a very small flat fee!</p>
<p>I also need to pay for original artwork/photography for the CD, printing &amp; duplication of the CD's, and packaging as well. I really want this to look professional, like something you would purchase at the store. I also want to make .mp3 files available for purchase, and the licensing for that will require some filing fees as well as attorney consultation fees.</p>
<p>If there is enough left over, I would like to purchase stickers! I already bought buttons with the help of some generous cash donations!</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>A little bit of everything! Depending on your donation, I will give you a sticker (or one of each if I do multiples) as well as one of each button I currently have printed, a CD* and any other merchandise that happen to come into my hands through this funding or donation. *<em>required donation of $10 for a free CD</em></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If every fan on my <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/meiamusic"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Meia Music"">Facebook</a> page were to donate about $10 to my campaign- I would have my goal and then some!!! So every donation counts- every dollar counts. If you love local music, and think that the music industry is in desprate need of revival and needs more originality in the songs available- you've come to the right place!</p>

<p class=""Default"">Extra Mild Sauce is an organization of visionaries who create quality music events nationwide.  Their collective professional experience spans over 15 years in music, film and event planning.  Since 2009, they have been committed to bringing community and families together through their free event SOULNIC. This year the producers are celebrating their 4<sup>th</sup> Annual SOULNIC on Saturday, June 29, from 9am to 10pm in Griffith Park at the Crystal Springs picnic area.   Events have been established in cities like <strong>Chicago </strong>(Chosen Few), <strong>New York </strong>(Soul Summit) and <strong>Atlanta </strong>(House in the Park). This year SOULNIC returns to <strong>Los Angeles</strong> on Saturday, June 29th, in the Crystal Springs area of the park.</p>
<p>Community participation in Los Angeles has grown from its first event in 2010 with over 300 friends and family to over 2,000 people in 2012.  SOULNIC is a free, fun filled day at the park, for families, in an environment that promotes love, peace, unity and community.  “I love being able to bring my mom, my aunties, kids to an event for us to be together for an entire day,” said one of the many families that attended the day’s festivities.</p>
<p class=""Default"">Proceeds from this year’s event from sponsorships and donations will benefit two non-profit organizations:<strong> On a Mission, </strong>a non-profit helping youth become responsible and productive citizens while acquiring important life skills needed to become successful adults. Their programs are designed to encourage kids to become active members in their communities for positive results.</p>
<p class=""Default"">The second group is called <strong>A Place Called Home</strong>, a non-profit youth center in South Central Los Angeles founded in 1993 providing educational programs, counseling, mentoring, music, dance, art classes, and fitness opportunities that encourage and empower youth to take ownership of the quality and direction of their lives.</p>

Even all of THUG's shirts are hand screen-printed by my dad and I! It really doesn't get any more DIY than this. Although it's nice to be able to take pride in everything that's made by your own hands and hard work, it's much better to see an amazing finished project in front of you all because of your dedicated fans.

I write, record, and produce the music myself as well as promote and play shows by myself. The past album's CD's were all printed and burned in my bedroom. Even all of THUG's shirts are hand screen-printed by my dad and I! It really doesn't get any more DIY than this. Although it's nice to be able to take pride in everything that's made by your own hands and hard work, it's much better to see an amazing finished project in front of you all because of your dedicated fans. With your help, I can get sleek new CD's and new merch professionally manufactured. So in the end, not only will THUG become a more competent looking project, but you'll care because you'll be wearing higher quality clothing and will have helped someone achieve their dream.Other Ways You Can HelpHelp by telling everyone you know and putting this page up all over your facebook, twitter, tumblr, and any other social networking website!

<i>My name is Wendy Darling</i><br/>
</h3>I have worked in the business of music and dance since I was 3. At the age of 14 I met my first Love and late husband David Carron. He played at Woodstock on the Free stage, made an album on Columbia Records and wrote a top 40 hit song for Alice Cooper. He and my father built the stage on the shore of the lake for as a platform. Music and Mermaids began to bubble up in 1967 and music became a wonderful part of our life. I have been promoting concert events in the summer since that time. Music, food, family fun, kids of all ages and magical unions are made. Last year was a rough year for many and although we have created these events without charge, it has become increasingly more difficult to do so. We are asking for assistance to continue to gather and connect. Some of the music we have promoted has helped bands further their musical careers and meet other musicians, creating an opportunity to make more amazing music. It has been a very important venue to many. With your kindness and generosity we hope to continue for years to come. <br/><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><b>$5.~$10.~$20.~$30.~$40.</b> any size donation is humbly accepted with deep gratitude. <br/>There are perks for some contributions of $50. or more.
