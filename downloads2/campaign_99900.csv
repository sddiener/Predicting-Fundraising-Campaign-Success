<p>Gareth came from England to Salta on his back-packing travels around the world, met a local girl, Irma, fell in love and they married and settled down. Gareth, who spoke very little Spanish was immersed into family life in Salta and began to get a command of the language. He started a small travel agency and was making progress when disaster struck. His brother David who had come to visit Gareth &amp; Irma in Salta for the arrival of their first child, was killed in a paragliding incident.</p>
<p>There were two outcomes of this family tragedy that have impacted on why we are asking for your support at this time.</p>

<p> The Fundación David Mather has been running for eight years, with the support of our partner Foundation in the UK, The David Mather Foundation. It has supported over sixty, academically bright, young people from highly disadvantaged backgrounds to be the first in their families to attend Higher and Further Education programmes.</p>
<p>Many of these young people, having gained their qualifications, are now experiencing great difficulty in finding appropriate, professional employment. They do not have the networks to help them to get started on the professional ladder. Our intention, in our new company, is to make a successful business that can also offer them employment opportunities. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501011720/u4lqbkkdpzg8juihvrhc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>The Company</strong></p>
<p>We are a family company with Gareth as the CEO and major driving force. We offer private tours specialising in Salta and the North West of Argentina but can also organise ‘Highlights of South America’, such as Rio, Machu Picchu and Iguacu Falls.</p>
<p><strong>Please visit our website <a href=""http://www.fivesensestraveller.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.fivesensestraveller.com</a> and our pages on Facebook and Instagram and our YouTube channel – 'Five Senses Travel Company'</strong></p>
<p><strong>Photographic &amp; Sound Equipment;</strong></p>
<p>You will see from our video that we have had to beg &amp; borrow equipment and the quality is, therefore, not too good. We apologise for the sound quality in particular. Imports are discouraged and heavily taxed and so it is not possible to find many of the types of equipment found in Europe or the US and the cost of even the most basic equipment is high.</p>
<p>With the importance of Social Media to all businesses we know that we need first-class equipment and well trained staff to ensure our promotional materials are up to scratch.</p>
<p><strong>Our People</strong></p>
<p>Argentina is suffering from inflation at 27% and poor employment opportunities. Wages are very low, particularly here in the North West and we believe, as a company, we can help local people break out of these challenging circumstances .</p>
<p>We want to offer four local people internships through the Fundacion to enable them to volunteer in the company, for six months at a time, in part-time roles, to be involved in sales and marketing of the company.</p>
<p>We would normally pay people through commission on sales, but as a new business we are building our customer base and whilst things have started quite well, we are having to plough any profits back into the business.  This means we cannot pay any salaries or retainers, YET.</p>
<p><strong>We hope to be able to take these first people on full-time after six months when we are more established, so need your help in the meantime.</strong></p>
<p>If this is successful we would then offer three more young people a six-month, paid internship to help them gain real work-experience and to add to their CV.</p>
<p>Our first three people from the Fundación are;</p>

<p>Our first local employee for future full-time employment is <strong>Luciana Carrizo</strong>, official Tourist Company Link – a must-have employee to sign off on tours etc directed by the local Authority but unpaid. She is very positive about the future of the company and wants to be part of its development.</p>
<p><strong>Our Campaign</strong></p>
<p>We came to the suggested salaries below through discussion with the young people concerned.</p>
<p>Our target is <strong>US$ 10,000</strong> to be used as follows;</p>
<p>1.       To pay three part-time internships for six months</p>
<p>4000 pesos (240 US$) each person per month = 72,000 pesos (4235 US$).</p>
<p>2.       To pay our tourism official, Luciana for six months</p>
<p>8000 pesos (500 US$) per month = 4800 pesos (2800 US$).</p>
<p>3.       To purchase decent camera equipment to enable the company and the new employees to promote our company with quality images and videos = 2000 US$</p>
<p>4.       To facilitate some media &amp; digital marketing = 500 US$</p>
<p>5.       To pay council and employment taxes and administrative charges for four employees for six months = 465 US$</p>
<p><strong>Total = 10,000 US$</strong></p>
<p>We will keep all supporters informed of the progress of the company and our new employees.</p>
<p><i><strong>We really need new friends to support us.</strong></i></p>
<p>The UK David Mather Foundation closed in December 2016 as family and friends had been supporting us for eight years and as most of our young people had gained their qualifications, we felt it was unfair to ask them to continue. The Fundacion David Mather in Salta, with Gareth as its President, continues in its attempts to support our young people getting into employment.</p>
<p>We, therefore, want to do our campaign<i> without asking family and friends in the UK who have supported our Foundation to support us again.</i></p>
<p>We are hoping that we can persuade new friends to help us raise our target.</p>

</div></div>","Our Story

Gareth came from England to Salta on his back-packing travels around the world, met a local girl, Irma, fell in love and they married and settled down. Gareth, who spoke very little Spanish was immersed into family life in Salta and began to get a command of the language. He started a small travel agency and was making progress when disaster struck. His brother David who had come to visit Gareth & Irma in Salta for the arrival of their first child, was killed in a paragliding incident.
There were two outcomes of this family tragedy that have impacted on why we are asking for your support at this time.
Firstly Gareth’s initial travel company closed as the whole family came to terms with what had happened and secondly it was decided to start a Fundación in David’s name.

 The Fundación David Mather has been running for eight years, with the support of our partner Foundation in the UK, The David Mather Foundation. It has supported over sixty, academically bright, young people from highly disadvantaged backgrounds to be the first in their families to attend Higher and Further Education programmes.
Many of these young people, having gained their qualifications, are now experiencing great difficulty in finding appropriate, professional employment. They do not have the networks to help them to get started on the professional ladder. Our intention, in our new company, is to make a successful business that can also offer them employment opportunities. 

The Company
We are a family company with Gareth as the CEO and major driving force. We offer private tours specialising in Salta and the North West of Argentina but can also organise ‘Highlights of South America’, such as Rio, Machu Picchu and Iguacu Falls.
Please visit our website www.fivesensestraveller.com and our pages on Facebook and Instagram and our YouTube channel – 'Five Senses Travel Company'
Photographic & Sound Equipment;
You will see from our video that we have had to beg & borrow equipment and the quality is, therefore, not too good. We apologise for the sound quality in particular. Imports are discouraged and heavily taxed and so it is not possible to find many of the types of equipment found in Europe or the US and the cost of even the most basic equipment is high.
With the importance of Social Media to all businesses we know that we need first-class equipment and well trained staff to ensure our promotional materials are up to scratch.
Our People
Argentina is suffering from inflation at 27% and poor employment opportunities. Wages are very low, particularly here in the North West and we believe, as a company, we can help local people break out of these challenging circumstances .
We want to offer four local people internships through the Fundacion to enable them to volunteer in the company, for six months at a time, in part-time roles, to be involved in sales and marketing of the company.
We would normally pay people through commission on sales, but as a new business we are building our customer base and whilst things have started quite well, we are having to plough any profits back into the business.  This means we cannot pay any salaries or retainers, YET.
We hope to be able to take these first people on full-time after six months when we are more established, so need your help in the meantime.
If this is successful we would then offer three more young people a six-month, paid internship to help them gain real work-experience and to add to their CV.
Our first three people from the Fundación are;

Rocio Saica – 23 years old, Fundación Student in her final year of a Business Studies Degree at our local university UNSA. She also has good English skills, partly through lessons at the Fundación and partly self-taught. She wants to work in tourism. 

Fernando Guedilla - 23 years old, Fundación student – completed his degree in Human Resources and having been unable to find work is now studying Health & Safety to enhance his chances. He is interested in all aspects of tourism

Ana Choque – 23 years old and in her final year of an Education degree. She needs to gain experience in a working environment before she can apply to work in Universities.

Our first local employee for future full-time employment is Luciana Carrizo, official Tourist Company Link – a must-have employee to sign off on tours etc directed by the local Authority but unpaid. She is very positive about the future of the company and wants to be part of its development.
Our Campaign
We came to the suggested salaries below through discussion with the young people concerned.
Our target is US$ 10,000 to be used as follows;
1.       To pay three part-time internships for six months
4000 pesos (240 US$) each person per month = 72,000 pesos (4235 US$).
2.       To pay our tourism official, Luciana for six months
8000 pesos (500 US$) per month = 4800 pesos (2800 US$).
3.       To purchase decent camera equipment to enable the company and the new employees to promote our company with quality images and videos = 2000 US$
4.       To facilitate some media & digital marketing = 500 US$
5.       To pay council and employment taxes and administrative charges for four employees for six months = 465 US$
Total = 10,000 US$
We will keep all supporters informed of the progress of the company and our new employees.
We really need new friends to support us.
The UK David Mather Foundation closed in December 2016 as family and friends had been supporting us for eight years and as most of our young people had gained their qualifications, we felt it was unfair to ask them to continue. The Fundacion David Mather in Salta, with Gareth as its President, continues in its attempts to support our young people getting into employment.
We, therefore, want to do our campaign without asking family and friends in the UK who have supported our Foundation to support us again.
We are hoping that we can persuade new friends to help us raise our target.
Our previously detailed website http://dmf.tenemportal.com/ is now being altered to become a small number of memorial pages and will summarise the work we have been doing and give future updates on students’ progress.
At www.fivesensestraveller.com you will be able to see our set tours and bespoke options. Please read our blog and learn more about living and travelling in Arentina.
Please also follow us on Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and LinkedIn and please share our sites with your social network friends– we want to thank you for your support and stay friends.
We would appreciate receiving your views and comments on our campaign and website.
Please e-mail;    iancraigmather@gmail.com
Finally, we hope you feel we are a company worth supporting and we hope to see you, with your voucher, here in Salta, soon.
Best wishes

<p>Firstly I'd like to say, please don't be put off by the fundraising target.</p>

<p>There's a lot of competition to even win a place on the starting grid, so we've done well to get this far. We'd like some funds to make sure we really do make it to the start (if not the finish) line.</p>
<p>Soapbox racing is fuelled by gravity (no engines involved) and relies on daring, creativity and silliness, so it would mean a huge amount to the team if you felt able to contribute a small amount.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need </h3> <ul> <li>Costumes - performance is vital, and we've got our eyes on some pretty spiffing items on ebay that will really add to the impression our team makes on the day</li>

Why AXS Map matters
See what the problem is
Watch the mapping begin
It has been a long road since Jason first came up with the idea for AXS Map back in 2008, but with your help, he can now get AXS Map out there, helping make a positive change in the lives of people with mobility impairments.
If you are unable to make a donation at this time, you can still help by registering on www.axsmap.com, and populating the database when we launch.

I currently sell my portraits and since visiting Paris Foto last year, I made the decision that my next big project would be to make a book. </p><p>A couple of weeks ago I made a very last minute decision to travel from Australia to France. The short version of the story is that I received an email on a Friday saying that I had won a First, Second and Third Prize in a Parisian Photographic Competition. I was invited to attend the exhibition opening which would be in Paris and then to travel to Arles for the best Photography Festival in France where more of the work would be shown. So that Monday I made the decision to leave for France, alone. My ticket was booked only a few hours before my departure and I left with $2 in my bank account. I had to borrow money so that my bank account wasn't empty when I arrived in France - otherwise I may not even get into the country! (I have since been payed!!)</p><p>Being at the Arles photography festival has been an amazing experience. I have met some amazing industry people and have been given some amazing opportunities - including the offer of a projection of my works. Discussions with the people that I have met and just being here has cemented in my mind the fact that I want to make a book. </p><p>I want to share the amazing places that I have seen, introduce the beautiful people I have met and share the funny stories that I have encountered along the way. The book would be a combination of photographs and words. Portraits of people, photographs of the stunning scenery and a description of each photograph included in the book. </p><p>Now that I am here, I want to continue to travel for as long as I can so that I can keep adding to the book. I hope that this will be the first of many travel journals. I hope that it will make a beautiful coffee table book and be a different take on travel books. </p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>Any funding will be incredibly helpful in making this dream happen. Already being in Europe, I feel its better to stay for as long as I can and continue to add to my body of work, so that, in the end I can put together a fantastic presentation. </p><p>Currently I am staying in budget accommodation and have been making salads and eating fruit. I don't want to waste money on eating out! I will continue to do this for the rest of the trip. I have also been lucky in that I have had offers from friends, new and old for free accommodation which is great. It means I can stay a little longer and will have some local knowledge! </p><p>My plan is to head from Arles to Spain, Spain to Morocco, Morocco back through France, France to Italy, Italy to Belgium, Belgium to Germany. Maybe not in that order but those are the places that I would like to go. </p><p>When I first began taking photos, my intention was to take photos that could be used to help people. Whether this be through sharing a story or raising awareness of a particular issue. This would also be a goal of creating this book. I will seek out minorities that need help exposing an issue, get to know locals in smaller communities and help them in any way I can. </p><p>Funding will be used to help with travel costs and the costs involved in putting my book together and getting it out there. I will be putting the book together with or without the help of funding so any funds raised will be going towards this cause, nothing will be wasted. Contributors perks will include photographic prints and copies of the book. </p><p>Back in Australia, I own a fine art Photographic Printer and would use this to print the images myself, thus ensuring they are of the best possible quality. All photographs would be printed on Archival Photographic Cotton, ensuring the colours are most vibrant and the prints most impressive. The book will be a collection of A4 prints that can be framed and hung on the wall if this is your intention.</p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>Your contribution will make it a whole lot easier and quicker for the project to come together. The project is something I intend to carry out with funding or without but any contributions will help immensely. </p><p><b>My Track Record</b></p><p>I am currently represented by and Art Gallery in Brighton Australia for the sale of my portraits.

I think that being in a place long enough that people start to become familiar with you also helps. On the plus side, this is the way I like to travel. I am not that interested in running around like a crazy person trying to see all the monuments and famous places in one day. In fact, I'm not even all that interested in that side of things.

</blockquote><p></p><h2>1)	Why do I need an everyday survival kit?</h2><p>Statistically, by the time this IndieGoGo campaign concludes:</p><ul><li>The president will have declared 4 natural disasters via FEMA</li></ul><ul><li>The US Coast guard will assist nearly 6000 people during 3100+ search and rescue operations, saving the lives of 497 people. Sadly, 71 people won’t survive. </li></ul><ul><li>2.5 Million Americans will travel internationally for a typical stay of 2+ weeks</li></ul><ul><li>The average American will spend nearly 24 hours driving in their car</li></ul><p><b>Bottom line:</b> Emergencies, disasters and potential survival situations are a part of our everyday lives and we need powerful everyday survival gear to effectively combat them. Ranging from inconvenient and minor to life threatening and severe, these emergencies will strike without warning or prejudice toward lifestyle, income, age, race, or gender. Murphy (from Murphy’s Law), is ruthless: he will strike us at the absolutely worst moment when we are unequipped, unprepared, and vulnerable. Don’t let him catch you offguard, keep a survival kit with you at all times.</p><h3>     Who is GyverGear for?</h3><ul><li>“Preppers”, Travellers, Do-It-Yourselfers, Military, Law Enforcement, Public Service Personnel, Pilots and Flight Attendants, Hikers, Campers, Boaters, Hunters, Parents…really anyone</li></ul><h3>     Who is GyverGear not for?</h3><ul><li>Anyone who likes being caught unprepared or thinks they are immune from everyday emergencies or disasters</li></ul><h2>2) GyverGear Story</h2><p>Even from day one of BUD/s (Navy SEAL Training program) the SEAL obsession with preparation and resourcefulness was pounded into our psyches. <b>“Never be caught unprepared, have backups to everything, and learn to use what’s available in new and clever ways”</b>. It’s our standard procedure to have an emergency kit within arms reach at all times. Usually, we carry it in a durable bottle that can fit nearly anywhere: a backpack pouch, a cargo pocket, or even a belt loop. When I came back from my most recent combat deployment I realized that my family and friends wouldn’t have this incredible “tool” at their fingertips during a crisis.

“Prepare for the unknown by studying how others in the past have coped with the unforeseeable and the unpredictable” – General George S. Patton
1)	Why do I need an everyday survival kit?Statistically, by the time this IndieGoGo campaign concludes:The president will have declared 4 natural disasters via FEMAThe US Coast guard will assist nearly 6000 people during 3100+ search and rescue operations, saving the lives of 497 people. Sadly, 71 people won’t survive. 2.5 Million Americans will travel internationally for a typical stay of 2+ weeksThe average American will spend nearly 24 hours driving in their carBottom line: Emergencies, disasters and potential survival situations are a part of our everyday lives and we need powerful everyday survival gear to effectively combat them. Ranging from inconvenient and minor to life threatening and severe, these emergencies will strike without warning or prejudice toward lifestyle, income, age, race, or gender. Murphy (from Murphy’s Law), is ruthless: he will strike us at the absolutely worst moment when we are unequipped, unprepared, and vulnerable. Don’t let him catch you offguard, keep a survival kit with you at all times.     Who is GyverGear for?“Preppers”, Travellers, Do-It-Yourselfers, Military, Law Enforcement, Public Service Personnel, Pilots and Flight Attendants, Hikers, Campers, Boaters, Hunters, Parents…really anyone     Who is GyverGear not for?Anyone who likes being caught unprepared or thinks they are immune from everyday emergencies or disasters2) GyverGear StoryEven from day one of BUD/s (Navy SEAL Training program) the SEAL obsession with preparation and resourcefulness was pounded into our psyches. “Never be caught unprepared, have backups to everything, and learn to use what’s available in new and clever ways”. It’s our standard procedure to have an emergency kit within arms reach at all times. Usually, we carry it in a durable bottle that can fit nearly anywhere: a backpack pouch, a cargo pocket, or even a belt loop. When I came back from my most recent combat deployment I realized that my family and friends wouldn’t have this incredible “tool” at their fingertips during a crisis. So, I went out to buy it for them, only to discover that it doesn’t exist. The only options were uselessly cheap, inadequate or completely out of touch with realistic survival situations. It was from this void that GyverGear was born with a mission: to create the ultimate everyday survival kits - small enough to carry, yet powerful enough to count.Every survival kit, commercial or homemade, is built upon three pillars1)	Affordability2)	Size to usefulness ratio3)	Durability and qualityUntil now, it has been virtually impossible to find a comprehensive survival kit prioritizing all three of these pillars.

<p><b>The Work Commute: </b>An issue for many coffee lovers, the morning or evening commute can often mean spending several pounds on mediocre coffee on the high street or even on the train. As a Make &amp; Take device, you can make your perfect brew at home knowing that it will remain warm until you get to work. The Oomph also fits perfectly in most car cup holders. </p>
<p><b>In The Office:</b> The Oomph will give you ultimate bragging rights on who has the best gadget along with the best coffee in the office. No longer will instant coffee or the percolator haunt your daily working. Plus because you can drink from the device or decant into cup, you could even consider share your coffee with colleagues... </p>
<p><b>Camping and Hiking:</b> When we are out in the wilderness we are all guilty of missing great coffee. As a self contained unit you can really make your perfect brew when out and about. As long as you’ve got hot water fresh from your camping stove and coffee, you will be the envy of the camp site (or the top of the mountain) with your delicious cup of coffee. </p>
<p><b>At Home:</b> Of course, The Oomph isn’t just about Better Coffee on the Go, it’s about having an amazing cup of coffee everywhere – this includes at home. The sleek and stylish design and range of colours mean that The Oomph will fit well into any kitchen or home office.</p>

It uses your movement to stir – ensuring for a great cup of coffee from the first to the last sip.        
     
 
 


 1. Add coffee. The Oomph has an internal marker indicating the perfect amount of coffee to use. We found the perfect amount to be between 25 and 28 grams of coffee. We have tested with all kinds of grinds (eg; espresso, cafetiere and omni) - and they all produce a wonderfully smooth cup of coffee!

2. Add hot water. Simply fill the Oomph with hot water and wait for a few seconds. A fill line indicates how much water to use. If you'd like a smaller or stronger coffee simply use less water.
 

3. Add pressure. Pressing down the outer shell of the Oomph forces pressurized water through the ground coffee; the perfectly brewed coffee then travels up the exterior walls and back into the internal chamber, resulting in an incredibly smooth and rich coffee. (This process also stirs the coffee)


Once brewed you can pour the coffee into a cup or grab your bag and keys and take The Oomph right out the door with you!

The Oomph is way more than just a just a fancy Cafetiere and (unlike a french press) pressure brews the coffee - resulting in a deliciously smooth and rich coffee. We have performed numerous tests against several coffee devices with the Oomph coming out on top. See below where we've pitched the Oomph against the French Press.

For this amount of delicious coffee we suggest between 25g and 28g of freshly ground coffee. The Oomph has been designed with an internal line so you don’t need a measuring spoon or scale.

</div></div>","People love summer but nobody likes to get overheated. When the sun becomes too much to handle, it would be perfect to have a personal air conditioner. But typical air conditioners are too heavy and cumbersome to take on the go. 

 
That’s why we created Coolingstyle, a compact and portable, go-anywhere, multifunctional air conditioner with 3 cooling effects and other useful functions.

 
For those who want to escape from the heat wave and stay cool, Coolingstyle is a must-have gadget.
 

 

Coolingstyle works perfectly both outdoors and indoors. It is a super portable device for you to stay cool during any outdoor activities such as camping, on the beach, in the backyard or for use in the home/office to have perfect cooling anytime.

<h3>Hi everyone.</h3>
<p>I am 17 years old.   Those of you who know me well can attest to the fact that I live to ride my bike down steep hills very fast.   I have been shredding mountains on 2 wheels for my whole life.  I've been passionate about the sport since I was very young.  I hadn't ever intended on riding competitively, but after achieving very strong race results on the BC Cup circut in 2011 and 2012 (without previous coaching or training), my fire was lit. Nelson and the West Kootenay region is sheltered from the mountain bike racing scene,  so my strong race results really made me stand out amongst the provincial race community.  </p>
<p>Due to these strong results, and my commitment to working hard,  I have been chose for a very prestigious spot on the PerformX Junior Development Team. This is an enormous opportunity for a young rider, and it will open  many doors for my future in racing. With the proffesional coaching, training and sponsors that come with this team I will be racing on the Canadian National Circut and with a lot of hard work and good results I will be fed into the Professional World Cup Downhill Circut. This is a dream for me personally, but it's also an opportunity to represent the West Kootenay and my province.  I'm working hard to fund raise, and my folks are helping me out.  With your help though, I can make this dream come true.   </p>
In total, my season will cost about $8000.  I'll face expenses for training, travel, and race fees.   I'm working part-time while finishing grade 12 so everything I earn is going towards my riding.  I'm also being sponsored by Kootenay Mountain Sports in Kaslo, Nelson &amp; District Credit Union, NRG Enterprises, The Nelson Lions CLub and the Nelson Cycling Club. Through Indie Gogo I'm hoping to raise $3000 of the $8000 I need.  
<p>Please consider making a donation to help me cover my riding expenses.  Every little bit will be very helpful.  If you can't make a financial donation, then please help spread the word about my campaign either through your personal connections or on Facebook. There may be others out there who would be keen to support a kid like me.   </p>

<h3>Chasing the Lights</h3>
<p>This project will chase the Northern Lights thru Alaska over the Winter of 2012-2013. I am fortunate to have an employer that allows me to work a 7 day on and 7 day off work schedule. My plan is to spend 8 weeks (every other week) over a period of four months traveling in Alaska from Anchorage to Deadhorse, Fairbanks, Tok, Valdez, and other remote and senic areas to capture the Aurora Borealis pheonomenon while documenting Alaska's natural beauty.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Currently I have funded and purchased the required photographic gear. I invested in a Nikon D800 36 megapixel camera to update the D300 I have used in the past, to capture in greater detail. I have invested in Nikon lenses and other equipment required.</p>
<p>The costs of pursuing this project includes gasoline to travel an estimated 8200 miles during the course of this project. The costs for fuel are approximated at $1,700.00.</p>
<p>Shelter and food during the 8 weeks are etimated at approximately $8400.00. Otherwise the plan is to sleep in my SUV in a sleeping bag rated for -40. Temperatures will range from +20 to -60 during this project. </p>
<p>Total expenses and project costs are estimated to be $10,250. I have sent the minimum goal at $1,000, but am hoping to fully fund the project. Any funds above the goal amont will be spent on additional equipment.</p>
<p>Alaska is a place of enchanting beauty, and I am greatful to be able to continue photographing and sharing in it's beauty.</p>

<h3>WHO: BadgeofShame</h3>
<p>Hi. I make the web series <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEEC5C055DCC425BE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Joe Goes"">“Joe Goes,” </a>which features visits to cities, countries, conventions, and random crazy events.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, we’ve done a lot of episodes at conventions. But the most popular videos have been visits to other countries, like England, The Netherlands and Japan.</p>
<p>And by far, the most requested episodes are “Joe Goes To FINLAND” and Joe Goes To SWEDEN.” I’ve always wanted to go there, meet the community of BadgeofShame fans, and ask them what is wrong with them. This is the campaign to help get the trip funded, so we can finally make these episodes happen.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>WHAT: Joe Goes To FINLAND &amp; Joe Goes To SWEDEN</h3>
<p>I want to make two episodes: “Joe Goes To FINLAND” and “Joe Goes To SWEDEN.” In which I interview people, stare at the camera awkwardly, and go ice swimming, because apparently they consider that ""fun."" (Jesus.)</p>
<p>Each episode will at least three parts, with each part 5-7 minutes long. (It could be more parts. Depends on how much we shoot.)</p>
<p>And the money is going toward the essentials:</p>
<p>- 6 plane flights: LA to Stockholm, Stockholm to Helsinki, and Helsinki to LA...for two people. (Me and my shooter.) (This alone costs $3400.)</p>
<p>- 8 nights in hotels...for two people. So we have three full days of shooting in each city and a half-day to check in. (This alone costs $1000)</p>
<p>- food, shooter's fee &amp; transportation per day (cabs, buses, trains, etc.)</p>
<p>It's not going to gold chains, chimpanzees, jetskis, prostitutes, and season 6 of The Golden Girls on Blu-Ray. And if there is extra money, that means we will spend more days in each country! (Yes, we might take the ferry from Stockholm to Helsinki instead of a plane flight.)</p>
<p>The videos will be shot like the first “Joe Goes” international videos, in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TBeC59WVgA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Joe Goes To LONDON"">London</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNdSmn33SYk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Joe Goes To AMSTERDAM"">Amsterdam</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6apCbUnSZ0o"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Joe Goes To IRELAND"">Dublin</a> &amp; <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GU2jwn1A2Zw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Joe Goes To SCOTLAND"">Glasgow</a>. (They will not be as comprehensive as the “Joe Goes To JAPAN” videos. Those were planned and produced by an ad agency and their client. I'm all alone, guys! I don't have a team.)</p>
<p>For more information, check out <strong><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSclwhZON0Q"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""UPDATE #1"">UPDATE #1.</a> </strong>And <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzfsMcryKlI"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>UPDATE #2.</strong></a></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>WHERE: Finland &amp; Sweden</h3>
<p><img alt=""Finland Sweden Badge of Shame"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://media.tumblr.com/18379f529a012c380f0ac5e26a6340f2/tumblr_inline_mgnpycJRuV1qbasto.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The plan is to spend 3 1/2 days in Stockholm and 3 1/2 days in Helsinki.</p>
<p>If the funds go well over <strong>$7,500*</strong>, we will consider expanding the trip.<br/><br/>For example, we could go to Rovaniemi to check out Santa Claus Village, or we could go to <span>Jukkasjärvi to stay in the Ice Hotel, if it's still open</span>. The <strong>PEOPLE WHO DONATE</strong> will get a vote on where we go, which wiill be done via email. </p>
<p>Please note that we can't go everywhere. I know a lot of you want us to come to your town, and sleep in your bed, and leave a terrible mess in your toilet. But covering two countries is daunting. Also, making YouTube videos is not my job! I work writing jobs to pay the bills, and I don’t feel comfortable being away for too long. </p>
<p>*I know in the video I said $7,000. But it turns out there will be $500 in Indiegogo / PayPal fees. So now it is $7,500.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>WHEN: <s>APRIL /</s> MAY</h3>
<p>I’d like to shoot the videos in April. Unless the weather is shitty. Is the weather going to be shitty? If the weather is shitty, then May.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> We will shoot the videos in late May at earliest...so we have the best weather. Meaning you can look forward to their release in June. We'll keep you updated.</p>
<h3>WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU?</h3>
<p>You get episodes of “Joe Goes” in Finland and Sweden! Without you guys, these episodes would not happen. I can no longer afford to pay for trips outside of LA on my own. My YouTube channel is not popular / profitable enough.</p>
<p>But there are some extra incentives:</p>
<p>Everyone who donates <strong>$1</strong> or more gets put on a secret email list. That means if we do a meet-up in Finland and Sweden, we will let you know where and when.</p>
<p>There are also little, terrible prizes for donations of <strong>$10, $25, $50, $75, $100, $200, $500 &amp; $1,000</strong>, which you can see on the toolbar to the right.</p>
<p>UPDATE: All perks include all previous perks. For example, for $25, you also get the $10 and $1 prizes...etc.</p>

<h3>WHY:</h3>
<p>So you can stop posting “Go to Finland!” and “Go To Sweden!” in the goddamn comments to every video!</p>
<p>Instead, you can post “Go to Stöðvarfjörður”</p>

And by far, the most requested episodes are “Joe Goes To FINLAND” and Joe Goes To SWEDEN.” I’ve always wanted to go there, meet the community of BadgeofShame fans, and ask them what is wrong with them. This is the campaign to help get the trip funded, so we can finally make these episodes happen.


WHAT: Joe Goes To FINLAND & Joe Goes To SWEDEN
I want to make two episodes: “Joe Goes To FINLAND” and “Joe Goes To SWEDEN.” In which I interview people, stare at the camera awkwardly, and go ice swimming, because apparently they consider that ""fun."" (Jesus.)
Each episode will at least three parts, with each part 5-7 minutes long. (It could be more parts. Depends on how much we shoot.)
And the money is going toward the essentials:
- 6 plane flights: LA to Stockholm, Stockholm to Helsinki, and Helsinki to LA...for two people. (Me and my shooter.) (This alone costs $3400.)
- 8 nights in hotels...for two people. So we have three full days of shooting in each city and a half-day to check in. (This alone costs $1000)
- food, shooter's fee & transportation per day (cabs, buses, trains, etc.)
It's not going to gold chains, chimpanzees, jetskis, prostitutes, and season 6 of The Golden Girls on Blu-Ray. And if there is extra money, that means we will spend more days in each country! (Yes, we might take the ferry from Stockholm to Helsinki instead of a plane flight.)
The videos will be shot like the first “Joe Goes” international videos, in London, Amsterdam, Dublin & Glasgow. (They will not be as comprehensive as the “Joe Goes To JAPAN” videos. Those were planned and produced by an ad agency and their client. I'm all alone, guys! I don't have a team.)
For more information, check out UPDATE #1. And UPDATE #2.


WHERE: Finland & Sweden

The plan is to spend 3 1/2 days in Stockholm and 3 1/2 days in Helsinki.
If the funds go well over $7,500*, we will consider expanding the trip.For example, we could go to Rovaniemi to check out Santa Claus Village, or we could go to Jukkasjärvi to stay in the Ice Hotel, if it's still open. The PEOPLE WHO DONATE will get a vote on where we go, which wiill be done via email. 
Please note that we can't go everywhere. I know a lot of you want us to come to your town, and sleep in your bed, and leave a terrible mess in your toilet. But covering two countries is daunting. Also, making YouTube videos is not my job! I work writing jobs to pay the bills, and I don’t feel comfortable being away for too long. 
*I know in the video I said $7,000. But it turns out there will be $500 in Indiegogo / PayPal fees. So now it is $7,500.


WHEN: APRIL / MAY
I’d like to shoot the videos in April. Unless the weather is shitty. Is the weather going to be shitty? If the weather is shitty, then May.
UPDATE: We will shoot the videos in late May at earliest...so we have the best weather. Meaning you can look forward to their release in June. We'll keep you updated.
WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU?
You get episodes of “Joe Goes” in Finland and Sweden! Without you guys, these episodes would not happen. I can no longer afford to pay for trips outside of LA on my own. My YouTube channel is not popular / profitable enough.
But there are some extra incentives:
Everyone who donates $1 or more gets put on a secret email list. That means if we do a meet-up in Finland and Sweden, we will let you know where and when.
There are also little, terrible prizes for donations of $10, $25, $50, $75, $100, $200, $500 & $1,000, which you can see on the toolbar to the right.
UPDATE: All perks include all previous perks. For example, for $25, you also get the $10 and $1 prizes...etc.

WHY:
So you can stop posting “Go to Finland!” and “Go To Sweden!” in the goddamn comments to every video!
Instead, you can post “Go to Stöðvarfjörður”",2.0,0,"3 Campaigns

One that was anti-theft, waterproof, and had pockets that actually made sense. When we wouldn’t find it, we made one. Since 2016, we’ve been shipping these bags out, and are so happy to create more designs and expand our line in hopes that any woman who loves our values will be able to find a bag that suits their lifestyle and tastes.</p><p>It all started on Carmen's honeymoon amid the lush open rice paddies in the town of Ubud in Bali, Indonesia. She was caught in a sudden rainstorm and her generic anti-theft crossbody  became thoroughly soaked in the rain. Everything, including her rupiahs, passport, and phone, were dripping wet or non-functional.<br/><br/>Karin also traveled with the same crossbodies on study abroad trips to France. While she remained safe as her classmates were being pick-pocketed left and right, her bag started falling apart at the seams. We were tired of the unfashionable and cheaply made anti-theft crossbodies out there.</p><p><strong>Why crowdfunding with Indiegogo?</strong></p><p>We launched our crossbody bags with Indiegogo last year to raise the capital needed to fund the initial order of bags. It can cost a lot to order all the materials and produce the bags, and there’s a minimum number of bags we need to order at once - so that can be a pretty big price tag for our young company. It's literally just the two of us, so it’s pretty amazing to use crowdfunding to connect personally with an awesome community and people like you who can help support us and spread the word! We’re in it for the long run, so your feedback as early supporter matter to us so much. We hope you’ll join us in this journey. We need you to make this happen!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511295472/u52bhnugnoaqqyf7odta.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>Q: Do you ship internationally?</strong></p><p>A: Yes! We ship to anywhere in the world. Shipping is free for U.S., and discounted for international orders. Please be aware of the specific import taxes and tariffs of the country you live in.</p><p><strong>Q: When will I receive the bag I purchased?</strong></p><p>A: We will fulfill the bags in March 2018. Barring any issues with production and shipping. </p><p><strong>Q: Why is fulfillment so far away? Can I get them sooner?</strong></p><p>Because this is a crowdfunded project, you cannot receive the bags earlier - they aren’t made yet! If you’ve never crowdfunded a project, don’t worry. Here’s how it works:</p><p>When you back a project it raises the amount funded for that specific campaign. Once the campaign reaches it’s goal, it is successful! You’re guaranteed to get the product. Some projects will cancel if the goal isn’t met and they will not charge you. We are not one of them and will definitely fulfill your orders.</p><p>From there, the funds raised can increase with more contributions and break “reach goals”. This will unlock perks that were previously unavailable. For example, our $20,000 reach goal is adding another color option. It’s basically a reward for raising more money than needed for our minimum needs, allowing us to have more monetary flexibility. If there’s a stretch goal you want, be sure to share our campaign with friends and family to help us reach that goal!</p><p>Each campaign has a number of days that they are running. We are running for 25 days. Once those 25 days are over, the campaign ends (Dec 22). We send you an email with a survey where you can tell us what color you would like your bags in. </p><p>This is when we start producing the products with the funds raised through the campaign. Once they are made and in our possession, we will ship them out! Our perk fulfillment will be in March 2018.

Our bags provide both practicality and good looks without compromise.We’ve already made crossbodies that we funded on Indiegogo last year. We’ve shipped them out to customers who carry them around the world everyday and LOVE their bags. We’re so excited to expand our line and present the Marina Convertible Wallet, Midi Surie Satchel, and Grande Surie Satchel, We’ve designed these bags with the feedback of you guys - our customers! With surveys, emails, phone calls and chats with people who use our bags everyday, we wanted to know what we what more we could bring to the table. The result: meticulously designed styles with features that take care of everything!Dimensions of Marina: 8 x 4.5 x 1.5 inMidi 11 x 7 x6 in (widest at base) Grande 13.5 x 8.5 x 7 in (widest at base) From the airplane, to the office, to the gym, to a night out on the town, Arden Cove bags keep your belongings secure no matter where you find yourself or what you put it through.That means you can travel confidently, knowing that our bags keep theft at bay and your belongings dry in the rain.Last year, we released our original Anti-theft Waterproof Crossbodies. It was a big success. We hit our goal in just 6 days, and ended up shipping our bags out to over 20 different countries! Women around the world told us how much they loved their Arden Cove bags. What our customers are saying about our original bags""I have never been so happy with a ""travel"" cross body bag. Most travel bags are functional and carry all that you need. However, they are not ""stylish"" nor are they something that you would want to carry on a nice dinner out while traveling. The Arden Cove bag(s) defy the typical travel bag mold and give you a bag you can use during the day AND at night. Talk about cutting down on what you need to pack!"" - Amy""I love all the safety features and I was so excited to find a safe travel bag that didn't look touristy! The bag looks exactly like the pictures, but I was pleasantly surprised that it was a bit bigger than I thought, It fits a small camera, phone, 600ml water bottle in the main compartment with plenty of room to spare. I'm actually going to use it as my carry on because it fits everything!""- Hannah ""I found the Arden Cove site online after being disappointed with the travel safe bags I could buy locally. (They did the job but were not stylish-even for an older traveller like me!) I am really happy with the quality of the bag...The full-size bag is perfect to hold my iPhone, iPad, sunglasses and even a small water bottle -as well as makeup tissues etc that always inhabit my bag. I can't wait to use my bag while traveling through Europe later in the year. I think I will have to buy a bag for each of my daughters who also plan to travel OS in the near future. So cute!""- Bernardine""I like all of the pocket and slot options, but I also like that the interior of the bag doesn't feel micro-managed. There's plenty of open space for me to figure out my own organization strategy.""- Kat""Every detail was thought out, from the matching inconspicuous zipper closures to the beautiful lavender color interior and interior French seam detailing. Also, like a luxury boutique the fabric samples of the bags color were included. Brilliant! The outer fabric quality is excellent, not flimsy and I like the bags structure and its substantial feel. I am very happy with the lobster claw clasp security feature, it is easy to use and it blends in so well with the gold chain detail that you cannot even tell if it is locked. The bag has a very minimalist look to it and I like that very much.""- RochelleArden Cove was founded by two sisters in San Francisco, who were searching for the perfect travel bag. One that was anti-theft, waterproof, and had pockets that actually made sense. When we wouldn’t find it, we made one. Since 2016, we’ve been shipping these bags out, and are so happy to create more designs and expand our line in hopes that any woman who loves our values will be able to find a bag that suits their lifestyle and tastes.It all started on Carmen's honeymoon amid the lush open rice paddies in the town of Ubud in Bali, Indonesia. She was caught in a sudden rainstorm and her generic anti-theft crossbody  became thoroughly soaked in the rain. Everything, including her rupiahs, passport, and phone, were dripping wet or non-functional.Karin also traveled with the same crossbodies on study abroad trips to France. While she remained safe as her classmates were being pick-pocketed left and right, her bag started falling apart at the seams. We were tired of the unfashionable and cheaply made anti-theft crossbodies out there.Why crowdfunding with Indiegogo?We launched our crossbody bags with Indiegogo last year to raise the capital needed to fund the initial order of bags. It can cost a lot to order all the materials and produce the bags, and there’s a minimum number of bags we need to order at once - so that can be a pretty big price tag for our young company. It's literally just the two of us, so it’s pretty amazing to use crowdfunding to connect personally with an awesome community and people like you who can help support us and spread the word! We’re in it for the long run, so your feedback as early supporter matter to us so much. We hope you’ll join us in this journey. We need you to make this happen!Q: Do you ship internationally?A: Yes! We ship to anywhere in the world. Shipping is free for U.S., and discounted for international orders. Please be aware of the specific import taxes and tariffs of the country you live in.Q: When will I receive the bag I purchased?A: We will fulfill the bags in March 2018. Barring any issues with production and shipping. Q: Why is fulfillment so far away? Can I get them sooner?Because this is a crowdfunded project, you cannot receive the bags earlier - they aren’t made yet! If you’ve never crowdfunded a project, don’t worry. Here’s how it works:When you back a project it raises the amount funded for that specific campaign. Once the campaign reaches it’s goal, it is successful! You’re guaranteed to get the product. Some projects will cancel if the goal isn’t met and they will not charge you. We are not one of them and will definitely fulfill your orders.From there, the funds raised can increase with more contributions and break “reach goals”. This will unlock perks that were previously unavailable. For example, our $20,000 reach goal is adding another color option. It’s basically a reward for raising more money than needed for our minimum needs, allowing us to have more monetary flexibility. If there’s a stretch goal you want, be sure to share our campaign with friends and family to help us reach that goal!Each campaign has a number of days that they are running. We are running for 25 days. Once those 25 days are over, the campaign ends (Dec 22). We send you an email with a survey where you can tell us what color you would like your bags in. This is when we start producing the products with the funds raised through the campaign. Once they are made and in our possession, we will ship them out! Our perk fulfillment will be in March 2018. You will receive an email with a tracking code and we will post updates on Indiegogo so you can know when to expect a package at your door.",31.0,0,"4 Campaigns

The Aquajet Dive H2 features revolutionary wings modeled after the wings found on the most hydrodynamic planes to allow the Aquajet Dive H2 to fly through the water with ease.We also developed a smart internal motor to drive the Aquajet Dive H2 with variable speeds and advanced safety controls.All of these unique features were developed by an experienced team with precision and careful attention to detail to ensure that the Aquajet Dive H2 provides not only a fun diving experience, but is incredibly safe for everyone with a minimal learning curve.       Exhibitions & Awards      The King of The SpeedThe Aquajet Dive H2 's smart motor has three variable speeds for users to control via the right wing with the top speed maxing out at 9km/h (5.6 mph). With high speed, you can freely enjoy flying on the surface and at depth.   Explore The ImpossibilityThe Aquajet Dive H2 's components are all waterproof. Science has shown that the vast majority of marine species live at depths less than 60 feet (18 m). The Aquajet Dive H2 is excellent for free diving applications with a measured depth of 18 meters. Explore the magical world underneath the surface with greater flexibility and a higher range of travel.   Surf Freely Like A DolphinThe Aquajet Dive H2 's motor is more powerful than any other underwater scooter, making it strong enough to carry four people at once.  The motor is powerful enough to ride along the ocean (something other DPV’s can’t do).  Free Diving With More PossibilitiesAquajet Dive H2 is a new agile way to explore the underwater world for beginners and advanced divers alike with easy controls and high-performance features. Aircraft-style wings give the Aquajet Dive H2 a sleek appearance while reducing water resistance to fly through currents and waves. Fly Beyond LimitsThe world’s first underwater scooter with wings.  Human and machine are in perfect balance with the wing design. The Aquajet Dive H2 ’s wings were based on the wings on the most powerful planes in the world for a streamlined diving experience with reduced resistance and minimal fatigue for divers.To offset the torque generated from the rotation of the motor and propeller, the tail’s bottom grille board features an arch shape design which provides maximum horizontal stability and a smooth control experience for the diver.   An Underwater Scooter for EveryoneNot a professional diver? Not a problem. You can easily learn to use the Aquajet Dive H2 in 10 minutes. The wings make controlling the Aquajet Dive H2 effortless and users can control the ride via the two magnetic buttons on either wing. Simply slip your arms through the straps, grab a hold of the wings, outstretch your arms and power on the device.  The left-hand powers the device, the right-hand controls the speed. Once you have control of the speed, subtle tilts of the wings are all that's necessary to adjust the direction of the Aquajet Dive H2. Tilt the device downwards to enter diving mode and point it up to jet to the surface. Designed to mimic the dynamic control of the wings on an airplane, the Aquajet Dive H2's wings give you precise control over the vehicle as you quickly glide through the water. All of the motor controls are installed in the wings with straps to lock the riders in, so you will never lose track of the Aquajet Dive H2 or stray from your chosen path. Five Safety ProtectionsWe always put your safety first. The Intelligent-controlled motor provides five safety protections. With an alarm light, it will keep you informed of any system alerts including low battery or motor problems.  Use It as A Rescue ToolThe Aquajet Dive H2 has been used to rescue someone in conjunction with a stranded victim. It is a perfect tool for rescue. By trained rescuers,  Aquajet Dive H2 can be used in a professional capacity. What's MoreThe Aquajet Dive H2 features many built-in safety and comfort features to make the dive seamless and enjoyable for all swimmers, regardless of skill level. These extra safety precautions protect not only the diver, but also the Aquajet Dive H2 ’s essential components to provide a safe, reliable and enjoyable diving experience.    Extra-long Battery LifeAquajet Dive H2 delivers with extra-long battery life. The built-in battery has a long charge life of over 100 minutes between charges allowing for more underwater and ocean surfing fun without the need to find a power source.   GoPro Mount CompatibleAquajet Dive H2 allows you to capture various angles above and under the ocean. With Aquajet Dive H2 's GoPro mount, you can not only film the marine life underwater, but also capture your surfing experience and your fun time with friends when kayaking.  Extremely QuietSince the propeller is directly driven by the H2 motor, it avoids gear noise. Aquajet Dive H2 is powerful with low noise, providing a peaceful and serene underwater experience that doesn’t disrupt any surrounding ocean life. Bring the AquaJet on your next adventure anywhere with the carry-on bag for easy transport.We include all the tools you need to make some minor adjustments, such as Allen wrenches, chargers and extra seal rings, and we even added a better dive experience with a weight and swim cap to adjust the buoyancy so that you walk under the surface.Include: Aquajet Dive H2 ×(1) Portable Bag×(1) Inflator Pump×(1) Battery×(1) Charger×(1) Extra Sealing Ring×(2) Allen Wrench×(1) Swimming Cap×(1) Clump Weight×(1)  Made with highly durable materials, Aquajet Dive H2 can be dropped, thrown into the water and more without having to worry about impacting its performance. No matter the difference in temperature from 5 to 60°C (41-140°F), corrosive offshore environment, or long-term sunlight, Aquajet Dive H2 will always be kept in perfect condition.Long maintenance periods of 12 months , so you can keep the diving fun going!  Maximum Speed: Up to 3.6 km/h over water; Up to 9 km/h under waterThree Speed Levels: 4 km/h; 6km/h; 9 km/hMaximum Thrust: 18kg, 40lbs   Battery: 400Wh, 15Ah lithium batteryOperating Time: 50-100 minMaximum Test Depth: 20mSafe Diving Depth For Beginner: 5mStandard Charging: Approx 4-5 hoursQuick Charging: Approx 2-3 hoursMaximum Power: 800WVoltage: DC 23-29.4VCruising Range: 6kmSize: 106*68*29cm, 42*27*11 inchWeight (Battery included): 14kgGross Weight (Package And Accessories Included): 20kgInput: 100V-240V AC   We did a lot of research on 20 underwater propellers and found out that the products which are under $1,000 are not suitable for recreational use in the ocean. The products that are over $1,000 are designed for professionals, which are too difficult for normal users. So, we designed H2, the only affordable, easy-to-operate, safe and powerful sea scooter for your recreational use. Most importantly, flying in the ocean is incredibly irresistible.   The wing design provides an easy experience The biggest challenge faced by flat wings is the fact that they are affected by water pressure.

The Impact
With the book and the photo exhibition I want to show how much the microcredit helps people to change their lives and the importance of empowering women.


How I'll use your money

Mainly the money I need is to buy flight tickets to Nicaragua (1500/2000$), cover the expenses there like a bed where to sleep, food, transportation, ... (I think that will be the cheapest part of the project), create and print the book (maybe with Blurb or maybe with other self publisher), print the photos for the exhibition and cover the exhibition's cost (place, invitations, vernissage, ...).

If I don't reach the amount I'll go there anyway using my savings, but I'll need to find some other sponsors (and isn't so easy...) to print the book and organizing the exhibition.
If fortunately I reach (or even exceed) the goal and I still have money after covering all costs, I'll use this amount for similar project (maybe in other Latin America's countries) and/or to show the exhibition somewhere else (maybe in Nicaragua too).

<h3><strong>Ever wish you had a guardian (dating) angel?  </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Sort of like a mini wing-woman sitting on your shoulder - whispering words of encouragement in your ear when you're out there navigating the dating scene?  </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Gently nudging you to make the approach when that hot woman walks by?  You know, that hot woman that literally paralyzes you out of a potential connection?</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Well, wish no longer.</strong></h3>
<p><strong>_</strong></p>
<h2><strong>WHAT IN THE WORLD IS <strong><em><strong><strong><em><strong><em><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/662771/pictures/original/20130215063122-wlcrop_PARLEZ_TM.jpg?1360938682"" src="""" style=""""/></em></strong></em></strong></strong></em></strong>?<br/></strong></h2>
<p>The PARLEZ<span>™</span> mobile app is an innovative approach to helping lesbian, bisexual, and bi-curious women make new connections. This app uses geo-location data from Facebook, Twitter, and Foursquare and pings you when other users are near.  PARLEZ<span>™</span> then gives you tips on how to make a proper approach, suggestions on different ways to approach, and rewards you for getting out there!</p>
<p>It’s modern technology meets old-school face-to-face encounters. In a nutshell, PARLEZ<span>™</span> provides a cool alternative to making new friends – and potentially – new romantic connections.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>WHAT'S THE STORY?</strong></h2>
<p>If you’re like most people, the idea of approaching a woman that caught your eye makes you incredibly uncomfortable. That’s exactly why we’re looking to create PARLEZ<span>™</span>.</p>
<p>PARLEZ<span>™</span> will help to address the following problems:</p>
<p>• Approach anxiety is very, very real.  This isn't just a man's problem.  Women have a hard time approaching other women too!</p>
<p>• We don’t always know when a woman is into women. This can be very, very tricky.</p>
<p>• The world is so caught up in modern technology that we’re losing touch with the value in personal interactions.</p>
<p>• The dating scene can be a bit …boring these days.  We're ready to shake things up.</p>
<p> </p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/324/587/8c65444812ff2dce1fe67505a0ec4db6_large.jpg?1357241192"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<div class=""template asset""> </div>
<h2><strong>WHY SHOULD I EVEN CARE ABOUT THIS APP?</strong></h2>
<p>Because you're on the Internet right now instead of being out there; socializing with new women. :) </p>
<p>Not reason enough? Well, here are a few more… </p>
<p>• You can make new friends – and if you’re brazen – a romantic connection or two. </p>
<p>• You’ll get tips on how to make the proper approach. We won't tell you <strong>exactly </strong>what to say, but we'll help you get your foot in the door.  We just want to increase your chances of success here. </p>
<p>• Discover opportunities to meet other women via fun events in your city. </p>
<p>• Stay easily connected with the new people you meet. </p>
<p>• Our ""PARLEZ<span>™</span> Club"" will give you access to awesome perks at our events.  Sort of like our own little VIP Club.  Nice, right?</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>BUT WHY DO I NEED <strong><em><strong><strong><em><strong><em><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/662771/pictures/original/20130215063122-wlcrop_PARLEZ_TM.jpg?1360938682"" src="""" style=""""/></em></strong></em></strong></strong></em></strong><strong> </strong>FOR THAT?</strong></h2>
<p>The purpose of the app is to encourage more frequent interactions with the women in our community, in more cities, and around the world. So far, we’ve been doing a lot to connect the women in our community, but to date, these efforts have been limited to New York City. We see PARLEZ<span>™</span> as an opportunity to scale our efforts and bring more women together – everywhere. </p>
<p>The app is meant to make the process of meeting new women really easy. We think this will give women more of what they want, as well as introduce the concept to a much wider audience. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>BUT THERE ARE ALREADY PLENTY OF WOMEN AROUND!</strong></h2>
<p>The reality is – there is currently no centralized place to meet new women and get tips on the process at the same time.  There are plenty of women around, but are you <strong>really</strong> interacting with them?</p>
<p> </p>

<h2><strong>WILL YOU GIVE US COOL GIFTS FOR SUPPORTING?</strong></h2>
<p>We hope you will want to contribute because you like the concept and are as excited about the possibilities as we are. Our mobile app will allow for more woman-to-woman connections to be made in more cities, while creating more opportunities for awesome events to take place. We want to use as much of our fundraising money as possible to move towards that goal. </p>
<p>But of course, as a token of gratitude for your support, we've created some fun gifts. They're not much, but it's our way of saying ""Thanks"" while using as much of your contribution as possible to accomplish the goals we've outlined.</p>

Gently nudging you to make the approach when that hot woman walks by?  You know, that hot woman that literally paralyzes you out of a potential connection?
Well, wish no longer.
_
WHAT IN THE WORLD IS ?
The PARLEZ™ mobile app is an innovative approach to helping lesbian, bisexual, and bi-curious women make new connections. This app uses geo-location data from Facebook, Twitter, and Foursquare and pings you when other users are near.  PARLEZ™ then gives you tips on how to make a proper approach, suggestions on different ways to approach, and rewards you for getting out there!
It’s modern technology meets old-school face-to-face encounters. In a nutshell, PARLEZ™ provides a cool alternative to making new friends – and potentially – new romantic connections.
 
WHAT'S THE STORY?
If you’re like most people, the idea of approaching a woman that caught your eye makes you incredibly uncomfortable. That’s exactly why we’re looking to create PARLEZ™.
PARLEZ™ will help to address the following problems:
• Approach anxiety is very, very real.  This isn't just a man's problem.  Women have a hard time approaching other women too!
• We don’t always know when a woman is into women. This can be very, very tricky.
• The world is so caught up in modern technology that we’re losing touch with the value in personal interactions.
• The dating scene can be a bit …boring these days.  We're ready to shake things up.
 

 
WHY SHOULD I EVEN CARE ABOUT THIS APP?
Because you're on the Internet right now instead of being out there; socializing with new women. :) 
Not reason enough? Well, here are a few more… 
• You can make new friends – and if you’re brazen – a romantic connection or two. 
• You’ll get tips on how to make the proper approach. We won't tell you exactly what to say, but we'll help you get your foot in the door.  We just want to increase your chances of success here. 
• Discover opportunities to meet other women via fun events in your city. 
• Stay easily connected with the new people you meet. 
• Our ""PARLEZ™ Club"" will give you access to awesome perks at our events.  Sort of like our own little VIP Club.  Nice, right?
 
BUT WHY DO I NEED  FOR THAT?
The purpose of the app is to encourage more frequent interactions with the women in our community, in more cities, and around the world. So far, we’ve been doing a lot to connect the women in our community, but to date, these efforts have been limited to New York City. We see PARLEZ™ as an opportunity to scale our efforts and bring more women together – everywhere. 
The app is meant to make the process of meeting new women really easy. We think this will give women more of what they want, as well as introduce the concept to a much wider audience. 
 
BUT THERE ARE ALREADY PLENTY OF WOMEN AROUND!
The reality is – there is currently no centralized place to meet new women and get tips on the process at the same time.  There are plenty of women around, but are you really interacting with them?
 

 
WILL YOU GIVE US COOL GIFTS FOR SUPPORTING?
We hope you will want to contribute because you like the concept and are as excited about the possibilities as we are. Our mobile app will allow for more woman-to-woman connections to be made in more cities, while creating more opportunities for awesome events to take place. We want to use as much of our fundraising money as possible to move towards that goal. 
But of course, as a token of gratitude for your support, we've created some fun gifts. They're not much, but it's our way of saying ""Thanks"" while using as much of your contribution as possible to accomplish the goals we've outlined.
 
     
    Note Pads                              Bic Pens
 
 
                          
    Stickers                                            Gum Packs 
 
 
        

 
    T-Shirts  
 
 
 
                  

 
   iPhone Cases             Limited Prints                       
 
 

JOIN THE  REVOLUTION!
Everyone involved in creating this app is a true advocate for the lesbian, bisexual, and bi-curious community.  We just want all of you out there to get as excited as we are about this!
As we grow, we really need the support of folks like you who see the potential in this concept and who would like to see PARLEZ™ expand to women all around the world.
 



PRIVACY - YES, THIS IS IMPORTANT TO US

The safety of our users is our priority. We're aware of the potential risks associated with developing an app such as this one, but we will do everything possible to make sure that PARLEZ™ creates not only a fun experience for all – but a safe and private one as well.

In an industry defined by the same old zipper and flap luggage, Trunkster's sexy silhouette, impeccable construction, and intelligent features define a new standard for the discerning traveler, bidding farewell to the brittle zippers, cumbersome flaps, flimsy handles, and unreliable wheels we've been forced to accept as the norm. Rugged yet refined, Trunkster’s singular design is the ultimate blend of form and function. Rather than just adding smart features to existing luggage, we aspired to introduce a game-changing design with our evolutionary sliding door. The last major update to the core design of luggage was wheels. And while many cool new features have been introduced since then, most have failed to improve the actual experience of using luggage. As avid travelers, we realized there's a fine line between useful features and superfluous gimmicks. For example, we realized most travelers never use the laptop compartment on carry-ons, opting instead to use a backpack or handbag. With that in mind, every inch of Trunkster has been thoughtfully considered to bring you a well-crafted suitcase that prioritizes utility and versatility in a minimalist style. Above all, Trunkster was designed for true wanderlusters seeking the most streamlined travel experience.

*To order multiple Trunksters, simply multiply the price (including shipping) at the respective reward level.

If you need more power, simply upgrade with any USB compatible power bank (carry-on only).

Where the money goes
 
All design and graphic work for this horsemanship app will be done by the Grey Horse. The money raised will all go to the development costs of this app. A lot of custom work will be involved. 
 
The more money we can raise, the more lessons we can include in the app. Indiegogo also takes some fees to host this project: 7% of funds raised cover the standard indiegogo.com costs. “When your campaign raises money, IndieGoGo charges a 4% fee on the money you raise. If you don't reach your goal, the fee is 9% on the money you raise. Third party payment processors charge an additional fee of about 3%.”
 
 
 
 
 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Big concept horsemanship principals
 
 
Here are the 'big concept' horsemanship lessons we want to create. The more funds we raise, the more exercises we can include in this app. 
 
Soft feel:Picking up a soft feel using the reins as cues, is the beginning of collection. A soft feel has to go from your hands to the horse’s mouth, through the horse’s body, and to his feet. A soft feel is when the horse isn’t pushing on you through the reins, and you’re not pushing on your horse with the rein either. It feels like you are both concentrating very hard on each other mentally. You will feel a lightness and softness in your hands and throughout the horse’s body. Being able to ask your horse for a soft feel will make a huge difference in the quality of ALL of your ridden work.
 
Footfall: As riders we need to know the footfall of all gaits in order to ride with knowledge and influence the horse’s movement efficiently.
 
Getting in time with your horse’s feet: When you ask your horse to turn or yield, without being aware of what his four feet are doing at that time, feels to the horse like you are purposely trying to trip him up. This app will teach you how to influence each leg – at the most appropriate and favourable time, in walk, trot and canter. Combined with soft feel, being able to truly ride in time with your horse’s feet takes riding up to much higher levels of performance. 
 
Achieving a balanced horse at halt: At the halt, the horse should be 50% forwards and 50% backwards. He should be equally prepared to move in any direct you ask him. At halt, some horses can lean on their forequarters and feel like they want to go forwards, more than any other direction. They are not in balance. This exercise teaches you how to address this and rebalance your horse so he is more prepared for any move you ask – not just forwards.
 
Using a change of balance at halt to prepare to move one foot laterally: To ask a horse to move his leg sideways, you must prepare by redistributing your weight on his back to allow him to do this easily. If a lot of your weight is actually going down to the foot you want to move, it makes it much more different for your horse to lift that foot. This exercise teaches you where to position your body in the saddle to allow each specified foot to move freely when asked.
 
Ask your horse to concentrate physically and mentally on your work together:To work well together, the horse and the rider must be constantly listening to each other. This exercise will teach you how to recognise when you horse looses focus on you, and how to get their attention back again in an efficient and simple way. 
 
Teaching personal space: It is very important that you teach your horse to respect your personal space. So he should not push into you, walk over you, or stand on top of you. This exercises gives you the tools to recognise when you are being pushed on, and how to improve the situation. 
 
Backup with soft feel: A horse should backup with softness and lightness, in a two beat gait.This exercise will teach you the steps to achieve this. 
 
Always do less: This is one of the biggest concepts in horsemanship and is the key to continuously make daily improvements in your riding. This exercise demonstrates the principal in practical terms. 
 
Feeling for and of the horse: When you use the reins, you should slowly pick up any slack, rather then surprise your horse by pulling on a slack rein suddenly and bumping on his mouth. Picking up the slack in the rein slowly give your horse time to be ready for a change and keeps him feeling relaxed.

<p></p>
<p><b>What is the meaning of your tagline: Life Energy Future?</b></p>
<p>Our actual tagline is based on three powerful concepts: Life. Energy. Future.</p>
<p>They are our fundamental pillars upon which we intend to build our company value proposition.</p>
<p>“Life” is related to Water, since water is the source of life for every living being.</p>
<p>“Energy” is a synonym of Electricity, certainly the modern way for empowering people.</p>
<p>“Future” refers to Connectivity, as a means of education, social evolution, future well being. In the XXIst century, the internet is everywhere and there is no future for disconnected communities.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Why are you combining water treatment, solar energy and Wifi all in the same device?</b></p>
<p>We could not design a modern solution and not think about integrating these three elements altogether. The beauty is that these services can be generated by exclusively harvesting solar energy. We provide clean water by leveraging the thermal effect of the solar irradiation. Through photovoltaic technology we generate electricity. With electricity we can power internal telecommunications devices (for satellite or 4G connection). </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Watly provides multiple services because each one is the consequence of the other. Watly is a multi-utility solar HUB and does not compete neither with water filtration systems or off-grid electricity generators. We are not simply building a product but a technological paradigm. Watly is something entirely new never seen before. And if this is not enough, wait to see how in the next future, Watly will also integrate many other amazing features.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p>
<p><b>How many people will you deliver water to?</b></p>
<p>One standard unit of Watly can deliver water to communities of up to 3000 people. It can purify up to 5000L of clean water in an average sunny day. Watly is scalable and can also be replicated, and so can the number of people that can benefit from it.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>How will you control Water supply for everyone in an equal way?</b></p>
<p>We are developing W-Tank, a 5L plastic water tank for personal usage. We will deliver one to each individual. Watly automatically refills this tanks when inserted in the machine by it’s owner, we can track the usage through its internal RFID chip.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>How many people will you deliver electricity to and how?</b></p>
<p>In theory one standard unit of Watly could recharge as many as 20000 smart-phones a day or about 5000 W-lights. Practically, we will serve hundreds of people each day for being able to be energy independent for 5-7 days.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>How are people going to know how to use this machine?</b></p>
<p>We count with the help of NGO’s and field partners to instruct communities about how Watly works. Anyways, we are designing simple visual instructions and sound effects that will guide people through the daily use of Watly, it interacts with people through different interfaces and multi-utilities workstations..  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>How will you assure security and theft?</b></p>
<p>Watly is pre-built in a factory, it is extremely difficult to disassemble any piece. Our designers have avoided using visible screws to prevent temptation and create beautiful lines.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>How are you going to transport this machine to hard to reach villages?</b></p>
<p>Watly is made of pre-built macro components. A complete and fully operational unit of Watly equipped with 3000 water tanks and 1000 battery power LED lights can be delivered to any location of the world by deploying five 40” high cube containers, each transportable by standard trucks. All Watly’s macro-components fit together automatically, only between four to eight days are needed from receiving the components to having the machine fully operational.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Have you proven your technology?</b></p>
<p>Our first prototype has been tested since July 2013, providing consistent data regarding reliability, efficiency and efficacy of the system. Our second prototype has been tested since March 2014, showing high levels of performance and no signs of mechanical failures or breakdowns. One prototype has been tested in Ghana. The outcomes were hugely successful. Several rounds inlet and outlet water analysis have conducted by accredited laboratories. Watly has successfully passed Philips Innovation Risk Assessment. Watly’s team is collaborating with TuV Rheinland to apply for a quality certification by TUV. Watly Factory is ISO 9001 and 14001 Certified.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Is your technology patented?</b></p>
<p>Indeed we have already obtained two major patents. Moreover Watly R&amp;D department is applying for a patent relative to graphene based technologies as well as patent application relative to a vapor compression distillation unit with unprecedented level of efficiency and reliability.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>For how many years will Watly be fully functional?</b></p>
<p>Watly's operational lifespan is of +10 years, even in the harshest environmental working conditions.</p>
<p>Watly’s lifespan can be extended beyond this limit with a complete check-up and a thorough maintenance intervention (+15-20 years).</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>How will you take care of the maintenance?</b></p>
<p>Anyone with basic technical knowledge and minimum skills can manage Watly. It has been designed to be fully autonomous and to require a minimum level of ordinary maintenance. In any case, should some intervention be needed, end users are always provided with a detailed but intuitive and friendly maintenance manual. Watly has local partners in each country to perform those technical interventions that do require specific training in possible failures, breakdowns, and extraordinary maintenance might be needed. By doing so, Watly also creates jobs locally.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>How “green” is Watly?</b></p>
<p>During its 15 years of service, one Watly can reduce as much as 2000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions (CO2), which is equivalent to 5000 barrels of oil. Watly also aims to reduce as much as possible the carbon footprint “during” the production phase of its devices. Watly is applying for life cycle inventory and impact assessment and plans to recycle up to 88.9% of its components.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>How does the wastewater treatment process take place exactly, and how does it compare to existing technologies?</b></p>
<p>Watly’s purification process works exclusively on solar energy and is based on the physical principle of vapor compression distillation. It is by far the most effective and powerful method of water purification and desalination available. The quality of the water purified by Watly, is outstanding, absolutely pure, low mineralized and with a perfect pH balance (6.8 - 7.2). Watly efficiently desalinates ocean water, eliminates all pathogens and microorganisms from previously polluted water, including: viruses, bacteria, parasites, fungi or cysts. It removes inorganic compounds as well as poisons: arsenic, benzene, heavy metals (such as lead), chlorine, chloramines, and radionuclides. It does not need membranes or filter substitutions. It even purifies radioactive water.</p>
<p>Watly in terms of efficacy, outperforms reverse osmosis, nano-filtration or ultraviolet purification methods. Existing technologies are pure water filtering machines rather than technological HUBs such as Watly. They require periodical maintenance and technical skills from the user point of view due to the use of filters and membranes. In addition, while studying the competition we have often found critical mechanical issues on both the thermal/electrical side. These systems are meant to fail, in harsh environments such as African or Indian landscapes.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Watly does not use Reverse Osmosis, right?</b></p>
<p>No, it does not and for good cause.</p>
<p>Comparing to reverse osmosis (the method used almost by default):</p>
<p> •  Watly does not use filters or membranes (which eliminates the need of substitution and risk of fouling and/or breakdowns).</p>
<p> •  Watly does not needs chemicals such as membrane cleaners, scale inhibitors, antiscalants, corrosion inhibitors, biocides, disinfectants, de-chlorinators and flocculants.</p>
<p> •  Watly does not waste water or reject untreated water back into the environment. (Watly efficacy is &gt; 99.5%; versus standard methods which are = 30-70%)</p>
<p> •  Watly does not have a defined limit of water contamination capability processing (provided that we are talking about liquid substances, not mud or solid waste only)</p>
<p> •  Watly does not destabilize the molecular structure of water; it simply reformats it to its natural pure energetic status.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Does Watly deliver distilled water?</b></p>
<p>No, it does not. Distilled water is only obtained during one of the intermediate phases of the purification process. Once water is purified, Watly re-mineralizes it and brings it back to ideal levels of pH.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Can you tell us with more detail about the purification method used?</b></p>

<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Why don’t you commercialise Watly 2.0?</b></p>
<p>Many months ago, we were following a different market approach. The idea was to build portable units, ideal for families and small communities. We have not completely abandoned the idea but for the moment, we have steered away from it and opted for building an “infrastructural solution” that can provide services to big communities and big villages.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>What's the market reception so far?</b></p>
<p>During the last months we have been gaining greater and greater momentum. There is a huge interest from potential customers around the world, ranging from the public sector, schools, hospitals, big corporations and NGOs. We have been in contact with some African governments that are budgeting large investments for solving their water and electricity issues. These countries are seriously considering renewable energy as key solutions. We have also been contacted by Indian representatives. The Middle-East will also be an extremely interesting market for us, especially Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar. Surprisingly we have even been contacted by people from California and Australia where water is becoming more and more of a problem. We are also in the radar of big corporations since they understand Watly as a mean of extending their portfolio of services.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Are you a for profit company?</b></p>
<p>We are a for “ethical” profit company. We do business accordingly to profound ethical values. It is quite clear that we are addressing ones of the greatest challenges of humanity but also ones of the biggest business opportunities of XXIst century. There is a huge market for those entrepreneurs and investors willing to make a step forward.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>What's your business model?</b></p>
<p>We sell our hardware to the public sector, schools, hospitals as well as big corporations and NGOs (BtoB, BtoG). We can also keep the ownership of the hardware and operate as a service provider. These services are delivered to final users and paid-as-they-go formula (BtoC).</p>

It has a tail that acts as an anchor. You lift your head, you drop the anchor on your back and as you sit back and relax, your own body keeps head and neck in place.)<br/></p><h2>Why did we start this project? </h2><p>We are a father &amp; son team and air travel is a common part of our lives. A lack of quality sleep during our trips was a reoccurring problem. Our goal was to create a product that allowed us to comfortably sleep while sitting on an airplane seat for extended periods of time. <br/><br/>Like most travelers, we used U-Shaped neck pillows and were mostly disappointed by their inability to provide adequate head and neck support. Frustration always ensued when they fell short. The need for a solution led to regular in-flight experimentation with multiple neck pillows, polyester airline blankets and every pillow we could get our hands on but nothing worked like we had hoped. <br/><br/>We found ourselves sitting at the bar one night swapping travel horror stories. We always enjoyed tackling problems associated with home projects, so this was quite enjoyable and oddly normal for us. We found some commonality among our stories and it always lead back to our inability to sleep while traveling on airplanes. The beers kept flowing and so did our creative juices and by the end of the night we had scribbled drawings down on a coaster and we believed that we had the beginnings of a solution. I guess you could call it a beer-piphany. <br/><br/>Over the following weeks, we experimented with duck tape mock ups and fabric scraps. It became a hobby and a great project to casually tackle together. We had fun tinkering and exploring everything from chin supports to literally strapping our heads to the headrest. Every little test served a purpose and some even proved comical. Within time and over 25 prototypes later, a useful and practical solution was born.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/880413/files/20140924174714-Product_Pics_side_by_side.jpg?1411606034"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/880415/files/20140924174745-Early_sketches.jpg?1411606065"" src="""" style=""""/></p>(Early Sketch)<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/880417/files/20140924174844-Sketch.jpg?1411606124"" src="""" style=""""/></p>(This was quick sketch for our video.

<h2>What is the purpose of this product?</h2>
<p>The SeatSnoozer prevents head bobbing from taking place, while trying to sleep in a seated position. It also provides adjustable, vertical and lateral head and neck support. This makes the SeatSnoozer ideal for sleeping during prolonged air travel. <br/><br/>Throughout the design process, we focused on: minimizing weight (3.4 oz), comfort, keeping it highly packable, functional and ready for use right out of your bag with no inflating or complicated setup. In the end it became different from standard travel pillows, in every way. <br/><br/>The SeatSnoozer looks unique and it is! Let’s face it; U-Shaped neck pillows didn’t look too normal when they first hit the market. Simply put, SeatSnoozer addresses the question of how to sleep on planes.</p>
<h2>What is it and how does it work?</h2>
<p>While it took quite a bit of work to identify proper angles and functionality, the finished product is actually quite simple. </p>
<p>The benefit is that it keeps your head and neck in place. It has a tail that acts as an anchor. You lift your head, you drop the anchor on your back and as you sit back and relax, your own body keeps head and neck in place.The ""anchor"" system makes it infinitely adjustable. After you fit it the first time, you can leave it setup for future use.</p>
<p>If that sounds confusing, I recommend watching our video above which demonstrates this more effectively than I explain via text :) </p>
<p>Making the SeatSnoozer this simple took a lot of work and our design proved patentable. It was a bonding experience that churned out a really useful solution. We were quite proud and happy we created a product that allowed us to comfortably sleep while sitting upright on planes.</p>
<h2>So, where are we at?  </h2>
<p>As part of the project, we developed over 25 prototypes, applied stringent functionality tests and design variations. We applied experience gathered with our SeatSnoozer V1 product, which was produced as a short run beta product and proof of concept. We attended the Boston Globe Travel show and received a lot of great input. The feedback gathered from frequent travelers helped us to steer our current design and functionality into the right direction. We have lined up our US-based manufacturer and have identified readily available materials for manufacture. All we need is successful funding from our Indiegogo campaign to help put this plan into action.  </p>

</div></div>","(The SeatSnoozer helps keep your head and neck in place when trying to sleep in a seated position. It has a tail that acts as an anchor. You lift your head, you drop the anchor on your back and as you sit back and relax, your own body keeps head and neck in place.)Why did we start this project? We are a father & son team and air travel is a common part of our lives. A lack of quality sleep during our trips was a reoccurring problem. Our goal was to create a product that allowed us to comfortably sleep while sitting on an airplane seat for extended periods of time. Like most travelers, we used U-Shaped neck pillows and were mostly disappointed by their inability to provide adequate head and neck support. Frustration always ensued when they fell short. The need for a solution led to regular in-flight experimentation with multiple neck pillows, polyester airline blankets and every pillow we could get our hands on but nothing worked like we had hoped. We found ourselves sitting at the bar one night swapping travel horror stories. We always enjoyed tackling problems associated with home projects, so this was quite enjoyable and oddly normal for us. We found some commonality among our stories and it always lead back to our inability to sleep while traveling on airplanes. The beers kept flowing and so did our creative juices and by the end of the night we had scribbled drawings down on a coaster and we believed that we had the beginnings of a solution. I guess you could call it a beer-piphany. Over the following weeks, we experimented with duck tape mock ups and fabric scraps. It became a hobby and a great project to casually tackle together. We had fun tinkering and exploring everything from chin supports to literally strapping our heads to the headrest. Every little test served a purpose and some even proved comical. Within time and over 25 prototypes later, a useful and practical solution was born.(Early Sketch)(This was quick sketch for our video. It shows all the components including how the neck pillow attaches.)

(Adjustable neck pillow is adjustable up/down and attaches via velcro. The neck pillow really makes this comfortable. It's like lumbar support for your neck.)
(Hear no evil with extra large ear cutouts to accommodate headphones of all sizes. This feature was a result of user feedback.)

(This shot demonstrates use with large headphones. Headphones not included :)

(Hard to tell with this picture but there's soft fleece material on the inside and an easy to clean material on the outside. We had to have this custom laminated to make it comfortable, durable and breathable.)

(Weighs in at just 3.4 ounces and you can squeeze it into your smallest carry-on. We wanted to make it light and compact and we achieved both.)

(Because a lot of the magic happens behind the back, it's difficult to see how it works in one shot. We used this foam head to demonstrate. Everything sits flat and in the right place when in actual use.)More product pics...
(Clean picture with the neck pillow off and on the side. It velcros to the unit once in use. You only have to set it up once and then it's good to go for all future use.)

<p>Hi! My name is Renzo. I'm a freelance designer from Argentina, and a <strong>mountain enthusiast </strong>who dreamt my entire life of <strong>working and making a living in the woods</strong>. But when we grow, we have to choose one path, and at that time, I chose arts.<br/>In 2013, a serious injury left me out of work but gave me the space to rethink my life. Although art is a huge part of who I am,<strong> forestry is my true path</strong>. So I took advantage of that crucial moment and I left to follow a big dream – <strong>to visit the mountains up in the legendary north</strong>; land of bears, wolves and many of Jack London's stories - Canada!<br/>I did not have enough money to fly, but with a resilient and traveling spirit, <strong>I hit the road</strong>. And after 3 years, 14 countries and endless stories, my thumb, my laptop and I arrived to <a href=""https://www.google.com.mx/maps/dir//Eagle+Plains,+YT,+Canada/@36.2205346,-136.7229016,3z/data=!4m16!1m7!3m6!1s0x51409875c7cf8831:0xabcf7fdeaf6fb802!2sEagle+Plains,+YT,+Canada!3b1!8m2!3d66.371078!4d-136.720468!4m7!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x51409875c7cf8831:0xabcf7fdeaf6fb802!2m2!1d-136.720468!2d66.371078?hl=en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Yukon</a>, Canada.<br/>Canada was all I had dreamed of and more. There I found the forests and courses with which I could start <strong>pursuing my dream of a Forestry career</strong>: I am going to attend forestry programs in British Columbia and become proficient in the field.

<li>
<strong>My Working Visa was approved!!!</strong> <br/><strike><strong><u>Rejection </u></strong><strong><u>on</u></strong><strong><u> my visa</u>:</strong> a <strong>very slim chance </strong>of  being the outcome.

</div></div>","Hi! My name is Renzo. I'm a freelance designer from Argentina, and a mountain enthusiast who dreamt my entire life of working and making a living in the woods. But when we grow, we have to choose one path, and at that time, I chose arts.In 2013, a serious injury left me out of work but gave me the space to rethink my life. Although art is a huge part of who I am, forestry is my true path. So I took advantage of that crucial moment and I left to follow a big dream – to visit the mountains up in the legendary north; land of bears, wolves and many of Jack London's stories - Canada!I did not have enough money to fly, but with a resilient and traveling spirit, I hit the road. And after 3 years, 14 countries and endless stories, my thumb, my laptop and I arrived to Yukon, Canada.Canada was all I had dreamed of and more. There I found the forests and courses with which I could start pursuing my dream of a Forestry career: I am going to attend forestry programs in British Columbia and become proficient in the field. That is why this is not a traveling project. The Visa I applied to has a high price, and I have raised a lot of money myself but need help with the remaining funds.Thank you for considering your support. Please give me a small chance and keep reading a bit more. It's worth it... believe me!!
 

Did you know that Argentina has never been included in a Working Holiday in Canada?!? Yet somehow, the sponsor in charge has recently been given a few spaces annually for Argentinians, without a formal agreement between governments. 
 

This project, doesn't finance the travel at all; is purely to fund the remaining part (44%) of the Program, because I'm already spending every penny on many requirements like the Inscription, flight tickets, Visa fees, certificates, translations, medical Insurance for 1 year, etc (Detailed breakdown list of costs further down).

 
This is the chance to amend my path by following my heart. One of the courses for which I'm getting scholarships is the ""Forestry Field Skills Program (FoFS)"" near Fort St. Johns, British Columbia.

 

Such training, will be priceless field knowledge to continue with a Forestry degree when I go back to Argentina. Eventually this will lead to a solid background to contribute to the sustainability and conservation of all forests, especially the famous Patagonian.
 
Not everyone feels the need of a drastic change in their lives. You feel fear, but also a fervent desire to succeed, to bet, to risk it all to follow your heart. Because you know what will make you happy. And where there's a will, there's a way. And surely, a lot of people willing to support us through that change...  


On the left, the things that with a lot of effort I've been paying (and will keep on paying)... I'm a determined and creative guy, using every skill in my power in order to keep raising money: from freelance graphic design, children’s book drawings, painting surfboards and murals, selling t-shirts with my artwork, pointillism portraits... But I am still pretty far away from gathering all the money I need. That's why I am asking for the help from the community to reach my goal.
 


Your contribution is priceless. And in exchange, I offer you perks with value, with work, to show you my appreciation for your support:

If none of them satisfies you, come to my shop on TeeSpring (or in Facebook) Maybe you find something of your like. I'll keep creating and uploading new ones!
 

If you can't afford a contribution, you can still help by spreading the word! Maybe in your circle of friends and relatives, there's somebody that can contribute!
 

I only have 2 risks... But small and worth taking:


Not reaching my goal: I'd have to find other way to earn the money because what I've paid so far is nonrefundable... But still, with a decent percentage I would be closer to my goal.

Every country I have visited, I've never exceeded a visa nor had any border rejection; I have all the required documents and proof of payment; I have strong links to my country; and, the company through which I'm applying has zero record of rejection in the past. Still, if it happens it wouldn't be the end.

Mi Visa fue aprobada!!!Rechazo del visado: la chance es muy pequeña. En cada país visitado, nunca he excedido mi visa ni fui rechazado; tengo todos los documentos y pruebas de pago solicitadas; tengo fuertes lazos con mi país; y la compañía a con la cual aplico tiene cero rechazos en todo su historial.Aún si sucediera, no sería el fin. Honraría mis recompensas y aplicaría nuevamente el año entrante luego de reparadas las causas que llevaran a tal resultado.",36.0,0,"1 Campaign

With airlines now charging for carry-on, check your bag and rest easy with E-CASE!  Featured on:
""E-CASE has security well and truly covered."" – Hey Gents        Never worry about overweight baggage fees again. E-CASE includes an innovative scale built into the wheels. No need to lift the bag. Just open the app, check your bag's weight in pounds or kilograms, and go! Did someone mistake your luggage for theirs? Or perhaps a thief ran off with it. Not to worry! E-CASE will send you an alert when it has strayed outside the range of your Bluetooth signal. Then use the real-time GPS signal to track down.E-CASE also has an automatic re-lock feature that can be used for security checkpoints. Leave your E-CASE temporarily unlocked. When the latches are opened and re-inserted, your E-CASE will automatically re-lock. You can also set it to auto-lock after a certain amount of time. SMART LUGGAGE JUST GOT SMARTERTough, durable, and surprisingly lightweight, E-CASE is the ONLY check-in bag with real-time GPS tracking and a built-in scale.E-CASE was globally patented in 2012 for its innovation in GPS and digital scale technology (Patent #US2015/0160069A1). It's taken many years to finalize product development and manufacturing. But now it's ready!Almost all other smart luggage on the market is carry-on, but lets get real. If you stow your bag in the overhead bin, chances are you probably won’t lose it. E-CASE takes smart luggage from a novelty to a necessity by offering two larger check-in sizes, as well as a carry-on case.All E-CASE's feature the same high-quality GPS, scale, and locking technology. BUILT BY A WORLD-CLASS TEAME-CASE is a USA company with a global team from Japan, Australia and Hong Kong. Lawrence, the CEO and co-founder, has over 20 years experience manufacturing and shipping luggage for these top brands and many more:The electronic engineering team joined E-CASE from three of the world's leading mobile technology companies: E-CASE was designed in Japan by the talented industrial designer, Sonoda Hiroshi. Most of the smart luggage on the market today use a separate tracking device – a cell tower based positioning method. This means positioning occurs once, when the luggage arrives at the airport. You can tell your bag has landed at a specific airport, but if it gets sent to the wrong carousel, you’re out of luck. HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED...What would it feel like to know exactly where your luggage is BEFORE you even get off the plane? E-CASE is the only smart luggage that uses a unique combination of real GPS, GSM, WiFi, and Bluetooth signals, allowing you to... WHY REAL GPS MATTERSWith the exception of Bluesmart (which only offers a carry-on) all other smart luggage uses GSM-GPRS. In order to comply with airline regulations, the GSM signal is disabled before takeoff and resumed after landing to get a one-time location update.But, what happens WITHOUT real GPS...

If the baggage did not get onto a plane? The ""resume on landing"" feature does not trigger and the baggage disappears forever with the tracker.

If the bag is lost at the destination airport? The one-time positioning update only tells the user that the baggage arrived at the airport, but no further information is available as to the exact location.
That means if you cannot find your baggage on the carousel where it should be, then it disappears again and you're helpless even though you know the baggage arrived at the airport... somewhere. E-CASE USES REAL GPSE-CASE is the only smart check-in luggage that offers real-time mapping with pinpoint accuracy both indoors and outside. Follow the movement of your luggage similar to following a breadcrumb trail. Whether on the road or in the air, you’ll be able to track the movements of your E-CASE in real time. The location is constantly monitored via the GPS module. The tracking data is sent to the E-CASE app via global GSM signal when not in flight, making it fully compliant with airline regulations.With E-CASE, you know exactly where your luggage is within the airport or anywhere on the planet. Just tell airline staff where to find it.... like a boss!We've got you covered. E-CASE is TSA compliant and compatible with airline regulations around the world.But you don't need to take our word for it...If airport security or the airlines confiscate or disable your E-CASE, we'll repair or replace your bag at no charge. E-CASE uses cutting edge algorithms to make your user experience as effortless as possible. It will automatically adjust positioning frequency to conserve battery. A light and vibration sensor lets the bag know when it is in the air, suspending the GSM signal automatically to comply with airline rules. This means that your E-CASE switches to sleep mode while in-flight to conserve power and awakens automatically when you need it.  Every element of E-CASE has been designed to be fully compliant with the TSA and regulatory organizations worldwide. Whether you’re checking in your E-CASE or taking it through security, you won’t have any problems. We have tested E-CASE at check in and security on both local and international flights. TSA standard locks have a major security issue, as anyone can download plans for a 3D printed master key from the internet. The E-CASE lock is the most secure on the market, and can be opened in three ways; via the mobile app, with your fingerprint, or from anywhere in the world via SMS. It will alert you if anyone attempts to tamper with it. The E-CASE carry-on model has the largest (12,000mAh) power-bank of any smart luggage on the market. Brilliantly designed to be removable, eliminating possible issues with airline restrictions and offering the added convenience of charging your devices in your seat while your bag is in the overhead bin.Keep your devices charged and ready to go.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>For 13 years we have perfected our unique Prague ghost tours, and have expanded our services to offer historical walks and accommodation in Prague city centre. We’re one of the highest-rated walking tours in Prague on TripAdvisor.</p>
<p>However, the current situation with coronavirus has put an end to tourism in the space of a day. The borders are closed, travel is prohibited, so we have been forced to close the entire company. Our professional, passionate tour guides and the other employees are forced to stay home, and we are extremely concerned for the future of the company.</p>
<p>The Czech government has no relief plan in place for small businesses, and we still have to pay our rent, utility bills, bills for pre-arranged services and, most importantly, we want to continue to pay our staff’s wages, now that they find themselves suddenly out of work.</p>
<p>We are asking for help to make sure our tours do not simply disappear forever. Any donations will go towards running costs of the company, and above all, towards staff wages.</p>
<p>We cannot survive without your help.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our target is 20,000 Euros. This amount will cover employees' wages as a priority and then the survival costs of the business and necessary expenses. We fully intend to re-open the establishment as soon as the travel ban is lifted.</p>
<p>The situation has slowly been improving so you can start planning your future holidays. We have prepared perks in the form of vouchers for the accommodation in the city center 5 min. away from the Old Town Square in the 14th century UNESCO building.

<p>Vouchers will be valid until December 2021. </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div>
<p>The impact of the coronavirus pandemic on tourism has been catastrophic. With travel restrictions preventing foreign visitors from coming to the Czech Republic and self-isolation rules keeping locals at home, our trade has ground to a halt. Moreover, many of our partners in the industry are also suffering, which has a knock-on effect to our business.</p>
<p>We are doing our utmost to keep the company running throughout this unprecedented situation, and can only hope that at the end of this pandemic, we will have a chance to take a breath and get as close to normal as possible. But we know it will not be easy.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our plan is to reopen as soon as possible once restrictions are lifted, but we recognize that this will not be an easy task. Even when the borders re-open, we understand that visitors will be cautious about traveling, so it may take some time for visitor numbers to recover and reach the level we saw prior to the Covid-19 outbreak.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that everyone needs help right now, but if you choose to support us, you will be helping not just our company but tourism in general. We want to be able to offer these services to visitors in the future. We want to welcome people back to Prague as soon as it is safe to do so.

Between the compact size of a pocket flashlight and the power of a search and rescue one. Between an easy-to-wear headlamp and a tactical far distance one. Between the battery capacity of a hiking lantern and the functionality of bike lights. Tronex is a combo of everything we need. Its light embraces the widest area possible. Nevertheless, it leaves your hands free. It can produce phenomenal 4500 lumens in the turbo mode or work up to 24 hours with lower power consumption. Tronex will charge your smartphone on a picnic or will light up your way while cycling or skateboarding.     We took an elegant design and combined it with aircraft-grade matte aluminum that is perfect for everyday use. The minimalistic design and streamlined shape of the flashlight make it functional and easy to carry.  The cosmic shape of Tronex can compete only with its cosmic power. An astounding 4900 lumens produced in turbo mode make it one of the top search and rescue flashlights of today. Tronex offers a wide spectrum of possibilities. You can utilize its power by either focusing its light in a narrow beam or lessening the focus of its lens to achieve maximum coverage. In the first case, you will get a long distance beam, in the second one – a wide angle of the lighted area. Each lens is adjusted individually so you can match the light to your needs.     You can turn on two lenses at the same time as well as utilize each of them individually. In case you use only one lens, the flashlight run time doubles. Apart from the focusing lens, Tronex features several modes of work:   We would like to mention the LED energy saving mode, too. We take special pride in it. This mode involves special LED circles. They are rather simplistic but at the same time, owing to a wide diode area, they produce high light density. As a result, you get soft unfocused light.   What is the main thing about a flashlight that leaves your hands free? Its reliable fixation!  Tronex has a polymeric belt capable of dealing with rupture load up to 200 kg. The belt retracts automatically to the flashlight body and hides under a soft fabric pad.  Because of the retractable mechanism, there is no need to adjust the belt, and the flashlight will always require minimum space among your belongings. The flashlight is fixed by means of a reliable and sturdy fastex clasp.         When needed, Tronex can serve as a power bank as it is equipped with a USB port. Its total battery capacity of 13.600 mAh is enough to charge multiple smartphones, a laptop, or even a drone.  Tronex has elegant, flexible, but sturdy cables with powerful lenses and a reliable waterproof body. High functionality and unsurpassed style are its main characteristics. This is the business card of the Tronex flashlight.  The battery is developed especially for high-performance devices. It is safe and ecological. It is perfect for gadgets with high energy consumption.    We are not empty-handed. We have an idea and a working prototype. It is our desire to help everyone who failed to find a comfortable and multifunctional flashlight to enjoy the reliability and style of Tronex. Support the project now – and enjoy all the Tronex advantages together with us!        Tronex has modern electronic features and patented technology for its self-retracting belts. The flashlight includes a mechanism to protect the optical components from overheating and to tackle issues with battery over-drain or overcharging. There is also a driver to stabilize brightness and keep it at a constant level.     Modern devices should always meet the demands of the third millennium.

My wife and kids had all gone back to the room for the day, and I decided to stay out on the beach and do some snorkeling. Before heading out into the water, I put my phone, earbuds, and cash in my shoe, which I covered with a towel and left on a beach chair. I swam out about 100 yards, and when I looked back to shore, I saw an individual shuffling through my stuff on the beach, and then walk away with something in his hand. I yelled to him, and swam back to shore as fast as I could, but by the time I got there, both he and my stuff were gone. This was a real downer for the vacation, and I decided that I needed a solution to prevent something like this from ever happening again. </p><p>That night I got on my laptop (because that’s what I do on vacation), and I began my search for a solution to the problem. To me, the problem was more complex than just a way to prevent my personal items from being stolen when I was at the beach. I had a whole list of requirements for this product I was seeking. First and foremost, I wanted a way to carry my personal items that would enable me to securely fasten them to a stationary object so they couldn’t be tampered with or stolen. In my mind, this would require a locking mechanism that couldn’t be broken, cut, or torn, and the container itself also needed to be made of something that was resistant to cutting or tearing. I basically wanted a product that would be impenetrable to thieves of all kinds, including protecting my credit cards and passports that contained RFID chips from unauthorized scanning (digital pickpocketing). Conversely, I wanted something stylish, attractive, and functional — something that would seamlessly fit into my everyday life, that I would enjoy using and be proud to be seen using. More and more, this was sounding to me like some kind of a bag. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1548736987/wsyev36pd9q6b46cdhtn.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>That’s what I needed — an everyday “go to” bag that would meet all my technical requirements, and still be soft, foldable/packable, comfortable, highly functional, attractive and fashionable, and durable. That shouldn’t be hard to find, I thought. Well, it was. In fact there was no product on the market that was even remotely close to what I was looking for. After exhausting my search, I began the process of creating the bag I was seeking. It took hundreds of hours of research, and countless prototypes and failed attempts. In the end, we created a product that blew people’s minds. </p><p>We launched our first product on Kickstarter in 2016, and we became, at that time, the highest grossing backpack ever in the history of Kickstarter, and we still are the highest grossing Kickstarter campaign ever in the State of Ohio.

This provides us the foresight and insight to be able to identify and minimize the most likely risks and challenges before they occur. We never let these out of our sight. All businesses face risks and challenges, and any business owner who believes they do not, is simply fooling his or her self, or is too naïve to recognize them. Risks must be actively managed, and ""hope"" is not a risk management technique. In order to better manage our risks and challenges, we approach them in 7 broad categories.</p><p>• Internal <br/>• Product <br/>• Supply Chain <br/>• Marketplace <br/>• Litigation <br/>• Force Majeure <br/>• Unforeseen</p><p>Internal: Internal risk refers to our ability to perform our work and deliver on our promises. These typically refer to labor issues, skill-set shortages, lack of capabilities, and management problems. We are a small company and we’re all owners. We have deep hands-on business management and operations experience, and a large rolodex of industry contacts. LOCTOTE is our dream, and we are 100% committed to making it a success. We maintain a very supportive and collaborative culture, and there is no amount of coffee we won’t consume and hours we won’t work in order to deliver on our commitments to our Backers. That said, we already have the products for this campaign in our warehouse, so our internal risk here is near zero.</p><p>Product: Product Risk refers to the risk of the end product not living up to expectations. This could be with regards to quality, performance, or any other product attributes represented to potential customers and Backers. We have minimized this risk by ensuring that we have real working versions of our products to wear-test before sharing them with the Indiegogo Community. We're not a new company, and this isn't our first rodeo. In addition, our ongoing continuous-improvement process ensures that every bit of feedback we get, both positive and negative, gets reviewed, discussed, and appropriately incorporated into our products. We will redesign parts, throw away materials and product, and remake products as many times as is necessary in order to ensure that the products our customers and Backers receive are great.</p><p>Supply Chain: Supply chain risk refers to not being able to source the raw materials and labor necessary to produce products. Supply chain risk is real for every company that produces something. We address this risk in several ways. First, we source as much as we can from small privately-owned businesses. These are small companies run by real people with whom we have developed close personal relationships. These aren’t the kinds of businesses that just lock their doors, shutter their windows, and disappear overnight. In addition, we are continuously talking to new suppliers to make sure we are getting the best value, and that we have alternatives in case one of our existing suppliers fails to deliver. Finally, we intentionally design our products using very simple components. To the extent possible, our raw materials are standard industrial materials capable of being spec’d out and sourced from numerous suppliers. To even further minimize this risk to our Indiegogo Backers, we have invested our own money and taken on personal debt to manufacture these bags and get them to our warehouse in Ohio. This ensures you that if you back our campaign, you WILL get your product in a timely fashion. We believe in our product and are all-in. We know you will love it too. </p><p>Marketplace: It’s possible that nobody will like our products. Frequently, great products are created to solve problems that nobody really cares about. We’ve also seen products that don’t solve the real problems they were created to solve. Our products are born out of real need, and they work. They make lives better, and do it in a better way than anything else available. We do everything within our control to produce the absolute best highest-quality products we can – from design and prototyping, through real-life testing, to production. We skimp on nothing. We believe that we have done everything we can to give you the kind of products you will value, use regularly, and be proud to own. </p><p>Litigation: This is the nightmare and back-of-the-mind fear of every business owner. Litigation can come from anywhere, and it can be crippling to a business both financially and in terms of time and resource demands. We have done everything we can to minimize this. We have a patent filed on our design. We have researched existing patents extensively to make sure that we’re not infringing on someone else’s work. We have permission from Henkel Corporation (the large multi-national corporation that owns the LOCTITE brand) to use the LOCTOTE name. We have trademarks filed, domain names purchased, trade names filed, and exclusive license agreements signed. We pay our bills, pay our taxes, don’t make claims and promises we cannot keep, eat our vegetables, and are kind to children and small animals. We have done everything ethical and prudent to ensure that the litigation boogeyman stays away from us.</p><p>Force Majeure: Force Majeure is a legal term that refers to extraordinary events or circumstances beyond our control such as a war, strike, riot, crime, terrorism, or acts of God (e.g. hurricane, flooding, earthquake, volcanic eruption, etc.). We believe that we have done all that we can to minimize this risk. We live and operate in Columbus, Ohio. Not being near a coastline or a major city, we are unlikely to be a major target in war or terrorism. Our weather is not extreme, and we have little to no seismic or volcanic activity. Crime is low and political and social unrest is minimal here. It’s actually quite boring. In the extremely unlikely occurrence of a Force Majeure event, we promise that we, or our surviving loved ones, will refund 100% of our Backers’ money if they cannot deliver on our commitments.</p><p>Unforeseen: Unforeseen risks and challenges are, by definition, infinite. In business, as in life, stuff happens and you need to be prepared to deal with it. When I first talked about unforeseen risks and challenges during our first crowdfunding campaign, I thought to myself, what could happen? We have anticipated and planned for everything. Three months later I was diagnosed with cancer. Okay, didn't see that one coming. I got through it, and we delivered on our promises. Not that getting cancer was a good thing, but having to face the real possibility of my early demise certainly helped me to recalibrate my life priorities. That said, we have, and will continue to, work through any and all challenges that come our way in order to uphold our commitments to ourselves and our Backers.</p></div>","The LOCTOTE Cinch Pack seemed like an obvious name to us for a backpack that is literally a “cinch” to use, and is used by ""cinching"" it. The Cinch Pack by the LOCTOTE INDUSTRIAL BAG CO. is a tough, practical, daily carry backpack, that's built with the worry-free security features you come to expect from LOCTOTE. It was designed to accommodate the lifestyles of people who travel in high-crime environments, or anybody on the go who has important or valuable things with them (like passports, electronics, wallets, keys, etc.), but does not want to be constantly worrying about, clutching or staring at them, and does not want to look like they are carrying a secure anti-theft bag. This is the bag that everybody, at some point in their life, wishes they had. Elegant in its simplicity and unapologetic in its brutal effectiveness. Sometimes you just need a safe place to put your personal items and valuables while you focus on something else. Like a trusted friend, you’ll want to take the Cinch Pack everywhere you go. It's lightweight, comfortable to carry, durable, hand-washable, UV resistant, latex and gluten free, low-calorie, low-carb, gender neutral, environmentally friendly, and politically correct (apologies vegans -- there is leather). Whether you’re dressed for the office, the gym, the beach, or a night out — LOCTOTE™ bags are a soft reliable friend that will protect your stuff from thieves, and you from bland accessories.1) Cinch the backpack shut by pulling on the straps2) Take the lock (or the carabiner clip) off the O-ring and wrap the strap around any fixed object 3) Go about your business & do what you have to do without worrying about your stuff getting stolen .   



The patent-pending UHMWPE (Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene) locking strap enables you to lock your bag shut, and to a fixed object. It's reinforced and grommeted with stainless steel, and assembled with solid brass components and hand-set rivets, making it really difficult to cut, break or tear without extreme force or heavy tools. At one end is a heavy-duty solid brass lock for high security, and at the other end is a solid brass carabiner clip for quick fastening.

Crafted from a woven layer of ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) and other state-of-the-art fibers, this makes our lockable bag truly secure.What does Level 4 Cut Protection Mean?Cut level 4 is a designation given to products that achieve a certain level of cut resistance on a standardized test. Level 4 textiles are recommended for use in industry for protecting against High Cut Hazards such as sheet metal, glass handling, anytime sharp knives are used, and anytime there is a risk of human or animal bites. Does this mean 100% Cut-Proof?Nothing is cut-proof. With the right tool, you can cut through anything. We didn’t perform a miracle, we just created a really high cut-level woven fabric, and then created a really well-thought-out bag completely surrounded with it (even under the cotton canvas) that would require a lot of time or effort to get into. In most cases, thieves will just move on. Our bags will keep your stuff safe, except under the most hostile circumstances.Our 1.25"" wide UHMWPE locking straps reinforced with a steel-reinforced inner core doubles as the backpack straps, making the backpack impossible to slash & grab yet still surprisingly comfortable.

The LOCTOTE Cinch Pack includes a large water-resistant fleece-lined internal pocket that is also lined with a tested RFID blocking material to shield credit cards & passports from electronic pick-pocketing.Rain, spills, splashes, puddles, high-tide, and general carelessness are the enemy of your small electronic devices and leather goods. Each LOCTOTE® bag is treated with an industrial water and stain repellant coating, and comes equipped with YKK Aquaguard zippers to keep your stuff as dry as possible.Cheap hardware, cheap leather, or ""pleather"" will ultimately look ugly and fail. We use stainless steel and brass exclusively for its strength, quality, and ability to keep looking good for years to come. We hand select all of our leather for its quality, feel, and thickness. Every detail has been thought through. We use heavy gauge UHMWPE thread (stronger than Kevlar) for its strength and cut resistance. Then we bind all of the seams internally using UHMWPE binding tape in order to make them stab-proof. Nobody else does these things. It's expensive and time consuming, and many people just don't care. We do, and we're not going to sell a product until we believe that it's the best it can be.

 

We owe all of our success to our loyal crowdfunding community and we will forever be grateful to you. You've got first dibs to get the LOCTOTE Cinch Pack at a really discounted price - and the first units to ever ship. First time backing on Indiegogo?

It is without difficulty, you must dismount your current license plate, insert the MotoChat turntable underneath, drill in the same places and reassemble all together with the rivets we provide you or your current system. A professional can do this in less than 5 minutesCan I choose the display mode? You have the ability to choose the fixed or dropdown mode for your written message. You can adjust the display and playback speed and you can adjust the intensity of the brightness. You will find all our help on the user manual.OF COURSE YOU 'LL HAVE MORE QUESTIONS BUT WE'LL BE THERE TO ANSWER YOU   Le systeme CARCHAT ne possède pas l'allumage au freinage , ni l'alerte de Warning comme le MOTOCHAT , il possède un système de fixation pour la plage arrière , le reste est similaire Et la compatibilité avec mon Smartphone ? MotoChat est compatible avec la plupart des systèmes d'exploitation O.S. IOS et ANDROIDEt avec un Intercom ? MotoChat ne crée pas de conflit avec les interphones car il utilise sa propre fréquence.Et avec un Intercom en appel? En cas d'appel ou de conversation sur un Intercom, vous pouvez désactiver Motochat à partir d'une simple commande vocale ""Stop"".MotoChat est-il étanche , résistant aux chocs, aux vibrations? Nous avons fait beaucoup de tests sur route, en toutes saisons, dans les chemins , les sessions de Karsher et nous n'avons constaté aucune défaillance .Quelle est la visibilité de MotoChat et jusqu'à quelle vitesse? Nous avons testé en plein soleil et à des vitesses supérieures aux vitesses légales et MotoChat reste visible jusqu'à au moins 19 mètres.Jusqu'à quelle vitesse le microphone est-il actif? Le microphone et la reconnaissance vocale fonctionnent sans soucis à des vitesses légales , bien au-delà mais après nous vous conseillons de fermer votre visière et bien articuler.L'application de localisation nécessite t'elle un abonnement ? Non , Motochat fonctionne avec une carte Sim de n'importe quel opérateur en Edge , GPRSComment se charge le MotoChat et en combien de temps? Le temps de charge varie en fonction de l'utilisation que vous en faites pendant votre voyage mais nos tests nous ont permis d'utiliser jusqu'à 7h30 en utilisation intensive. Pour charger, il suffit d'ouvrir la platine de fixation , de retirer le module MotoChat et de le brancher sur le secteur ou sur un PC, le temps de charge est généralement inférieur à une heure .Puis-je fixer la plaque de support MotoChat moi-même sur ma moto ? Pour la fixation de votre platine il faut 5 minutes. C'est facile, vous devez démonter votre plaque d'immatriculation actuelle, insérer la platine MotoChat en dessous, percer dans les mêmes endroits et ré-assembler tout ensemble avec les rivets que nous vous fournissons ou votre système actuel. Un professionnel peut le faire en moins de 5 minutes.Puis je chosir le mode d'affichage ? Vous avez la capacité de choisir le mode fixe ou déroulant pour votre message écrit . Vous pouvez régler la vitesse d'affichage et de déroulement et vous pouvez régler l'intensité de la luminosité .

On campus I'm involved with a few organizations one of them being the Alternative Break Program through the Holden Center. Last year I went on a trip to San Diego, California where we worked with local organizations on issues involving immigration in an effort to make immigration safer and our communities stronger. We worked with groups like Water Stations, Border Angels, that seek to help migrants survive crossing the borderlands into a potentially deathly situation. </p><p>This year I am one of three leaders taking a group of 16 students to Los Angeles, California where we will work on issues surrounding urban poverty from a food justice standpoint. I got inspired to create this trip through the Ted Talk Ron Finley gave last year on his organization LA Green Grounds and the concept of guerrilla gardening. We will be working with local organizations to examine the issue of how food can affect urban poverty and how lack of access to healthy foods crosses racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic boundaries. The goal of this trip is to deepen our understanding of how lack of access to healthy foods impacts entire communities and has an effect on crime rates, economic status, and obesity rates. We will be working in LA for three days with Los Angeles Green Grounds and Homeboy Industries. Then we will travel up to Oakland and spend the last two days working with People's Grocery and Jessica Wilson's My Kitchen Dietician. We will get to experience food justice from several different standpoints in several different communities and through this build a comprehensive view of what communities our institutions in the United States have effected. </p><p>Alternative Breaks is an organization that gives students the opportunity to complete real, hands on service that effects marginalized communities as an alternative to spending their break elsewhere. It is essentially student run with help from our Alternative Break director and our Educational Partner. </p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need </h3><p>The cost for one student to participate in the program is $500. I have enough money to make the trip on my own but many of my participants are worried about finances. I want to be able to give a scholarship to the student in most need. The biggest barrier to these trips is the cost. We have the students that want to go but we don't necessarily have the money. 100% of the money would go directly to the students who are in the most financial hardship with the trip. None of the money will go to my expenses on the trip because I am fortunate enough not to need the money.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>As will all service work the impact is like the butterfly effect, one small initial difference can make a huge effect. While we will only be spending one week on this service trip, the self knowledge and personal growth we will have will be, for lack of a better term, life-changing. Service-learning work in this way is about building bridges between communities, gaining real experience and knowledge on a social issue that is effecting the daily lives of our citizens, and learning about our own power and privilege, or lack thereof, in our own lives. The work we will be doing in California will be transplanted back into our own communities as we start to see a paradigm shift in the equability of access to nutritional foods in lower income and marginalized communities. By donating, you will be directly helping both the lives of community members living in LA and Oakland who have been effected by food deserts, as well as, helping a college student get to participate in this experience.  </p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">Ways You Can Help</span></p><p>Please donate!!

<h3>Meet STAKI</h3>
<p>STAKI Controls are a new generation of compact-size skis providing performance enhancement and safety. The special stabilising tail with metal edges ensure that the skis will not slip, unlike with standard skis. It slows down and returns the skier back to a stable position. The skis’ geometric structure combined with a patented innovative tail gives you the ability to maintain a balanced position and prevents you from flinging back while skiing on an uneven surface. With this feature, the skis are suitable for both beginners and experienced skiers who enjoy leaving the groomed slopes behind in favour of off-piste, backcountry skiing. STAKIs come with adjustable binding, which is incredibly comfortable compared to common binding used on any other type of skis, including snowblades.</p>

<p> </p></div>","The Toughest Race on Earth - The Story is an exciting project for the fans and followers of this race world wide.
We are raising funds for the coverage of this race and acquiring footage and photographs for a full documentary film and coffee table art book, which will be funded separately.
We will bring more immediacy and high quality video features, interviews and daily uploads of images to the  social media sites of the organization.
Our images and media show the race in all its glory, the beautiful relationship between man and dog, the sheer toughness of this unforgiving climate, the emotions felt by mushers, handlers, followers and the dogs too...
Most importantly, we tell the stories from along the trail, not just take pictures...We will bring the stories in the race to life.
The best of the images will be selected and published in the 100 + page coffee table souvenir book.
The funds we raise will cover the expedition expenses and the team's ability to travel the trail, upload and produce for you.
This project has no financial affiliation with the Yukon Quest, and no money raised here will go to the organization.
Below are some of our images from 2012.

<p>WAYB is a new company founded by the makers of the world’s best outdoor gear and the former CEO of Patagonia. Our team is full of parents who loved to travel before we had kids, but now that we have wee ones… we still love to travel! Travel is just part of who we are and we aren’t going to park it at home just because we have junior humans.</p>
<p>What we don’t love is schlepping bulky, heavy gear. And we really hate having to choose between lugging a giant car seat or skipping it. That’s why we made Pico™ (patent pending) , a travel car seat that’s light and compact.</p>

<h3>What makes Pico way better</h3>
<p>You know what airplanes and space shuttles are made of? Aluminum! Aluminum is ultralight while still being incredibly strong. And it’s the secret to Pico. Instead of a bulky, plastic shell, our Pico travel car seat has an aerospace-grade aluminum frame and a breathable, technical mesh so it’s easy to carry, use, and clean.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1539094851/ltrtu3qzrrzhioeutsmm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The foams in other car seats can be full of toxins, so we made the Pico with energy-absorbing 6000 and 7000-series aluminum, a comfortable mesh fabric, and minimal foam or plastic. Pico meets and exceeds the same U.S. car and plane safety regulations as those big, heavy car seats. It's not just lightweight, we also look at every material and process to make a product that's way better for people and the planet.</p>

<p>In early 2018, our team spent a weekend in Ojai, deciding what kind of company we were going to be. We knew that by aiming to make products with non-toxic, eco-friendly materials, we'd be looking at higher costs. The team had to consider if we would sell two tiers of products: one made the typical way, at a lower price point, and a more expensive version, made healthier and more sustainable. We knew the competition did this, charging more for the version that's not full of toxins or trash. And we knew we could probably sell more products that way. But that's not the kind of mission we wanted to be on. We held hands* and decided that every product carrying the WAYB name would be the best version - the one we'd want for our own kids.</p>

responsibility and is provided by a positive attitude towards the handling and 
responsible use of firearms and archery equipment, as well as environment safety.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>AFFORDABLE:</b> We are going to be providing a public service not only by 
providing a safe place to shoot, but also by providing an alternative 
to “farm shooting”. To allow maximum use, barriers to participation must be 
lowered. Keeping the shooting experience affordable will increase use and enable 
all social levels.<br/><br/></span></li>
<li>
<b>FUN:</b> The experience of recreational shooting is fun. Barriers to allowing 
the members to enjoy the shooting range and to have a memorable experience will 
be eliminated.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>FAMILY-ORIENTED:</b> Programs, products and services will be designed to offer 
family experiences. <br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>WORLD CLASS: </b> World Class implies “top of the line, top drawer, first rate, 
none better.” We will meet and exceed the industry “five star” standards whenever possible.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>RECREATIONAL SHOOTING FACILITY: </b> Our line of business is shooting recreation, 
training, education, and programs to support the shooting sports. We will focus 
on being the best (safe, affordable, fun, family oriented, public, world class) 
shooting facility.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>FAMILY OUTING FACILITY: </b>To more fully utilize the space available, family 
oriented services such as sand volleyball, hiking trails,horse shoes and fishing will be 
available. Classes will be taught in Outdoor Photography, Portrait Photography, 
Painting, Sketching and more. A catalog of available courses will be

<h2><strong>Motivation</strong></h2>
<p><br/>There are several things that are motivating me to pursue this 
project. These are my love of the sport of target shooting and my love for the 
community where my wife, our children and I have chosen to make our home.</p>
<p>In the 12 years that we have lived in Norfolk Nebraska, I have located a 
few places that are legal to shoot, but I don’t consider them safe. I have 
located a place that is legal and safe but is a long drive (and expensive).</p>
<p>I also want to see this project succeed to be an asset to the 
community. I want this to be a destination facility - a place where the family can get in the car and spend the day enjoying nature. <b><i>This 
is eco-tourism at it's  finest.</i></b></p>
<p>This facility will be large enough to host national level 
competitions, each of which will bring lodging, food and gas purchases and 
traffic to downtown.</p>
<p>I will be offering free use of the facility to local law enforcement officers for practice and qualification, and will be inviting them to do community outreach programs at the facility.</p>
<p>I will be seeking out those who are Active Duty or Retired from the Armed Forces to serve as paid instructors.  I will also be hosting events to honor those who have served, or are serving.</p>
<p>I will be in touch with area shelters that serve those with disabilities.  I will be inviting them for picnics and if their level allows, will put them to work.</p>
<p>I will be in touch with agencies and facilities that serve the aged, and they will be invited to picnics and maybe art classes on the property.</p>
<p>Residents of the Rescue Mission will be invited to the facility for a day out in the sunshine. </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary In days gone by, a shooting range was a hillside and a picnic table.  I want to change that.  The Range,LLC. is going to be a range and outdoor recreation center like no other.  

The mission of The Range is to be a safe, affordable, fun, family-oriented, 
world-class, recreational shooting and family outing 
facility.



SAFE: Safety is our number one management priority. Safety is everyone’s 
responsibility and is provided by a positive attitude towards the handling and 
responsible use of firearms and archery equipment, as well as environment safety.

AFFORDABLE: We are going to be providing a public service not only by 
providing a safe place to shoot, but also by providing an alternative 
to “farm shooting”. To allow maximum use, barriers to participation must be 
lowered. Keeping the shooting experience affordable will increase use and enable 
all social levels.

FUN: The experience of recreational shooting is fun. Barriers to allowing 
the members to enjoy the shooting range and to have a memorable experience will 
be eliminated.


FAMILY-ORIENTED: Programs, products and services will be designed to offer 
family experiences. 


WORLD CLASS:  World Class implies “top of the line, top drawer, first rate, 
none better.” We will meet and exceed the industry “five star” standards whenever possible.


RECREATIONAL SHOOTING FACILITY:  Our line of business is shooting recreation, 
training, education, and programs to support the shooting sports. We will focus 
on being the best (safe, affordable, fun, family oriented, public, world class) 
shooting facility.


FAMILY OUTING FACILITY: To more fully utilize the space available, family 
oriented services such as sand volleyball, hiking trails,horse shoes and fishing will be 
available. Classes will be taught in Outdoor Photography, Portrait Photography, 
Painting, Sketching and more. A catalog of available courses will be 
published.



Motivation
There are several things that are motivating me to pursue this 
project. These are my love of the sport of target shooting and my love for the 
community where my wife, our children and I have chosen to make our home.
In the 12 years that we have lived in Norfolk Nebraska, I have located a 
few places that are legal to shoot, but I don’t consider them safe. I have 
located a place that is legal and safe but is a long drive (and expensive).
I also want to see this project succeed to be an asset to the 
community. I want this to be a destination facility - a place where the family can get in the car and spend the day enjoying nature. This 
is eco-tourism at it's  finest.
This facility will be large enough to host national level 
competitions, each of which will bring lodging, food and gas purchases and 
traffic to downtown.
I will be offering free use of the facility to local law enforcement officers for practice and qualification, and will be inviting them to do community outreach programs at the facility.
I will be seeking out those who are Active Duty or Retired from the Armed Forces to serve as paid instructors.  I will also be hosting events to honor those who have served, or are serving.
I will be in touch with area shelters that serve those with disabilities.  I will be inviting them for picnics and if their level allows, will put them to work.
I will be in touch with agencies and facilities that serve the aged, and they will be invited to picnics and maybe art classes on the property.
Residents of the Rescue Mission will be invited to the facility for a day out in the sunshine. 
 

  What We Need & What You Get I am seeking $200,000 from this campaign.  These funds will be used for:



Down payment on property (I am searching for 300-500 acres)


Payment of loan payments until the facility opens


Purchase of 100 concrete shooting benches


Purchase of a used payloader and fuel


Purchase of materials to build pavilions 


Purchase of equipment for Trap and Skeet


Insurance


and other start-up costs.




  The Impact
This facility will provide a safe facility for both target shooting and taking classes.  In addition, we (you and I) will be hiring Veterans whenever possible.  

The facility will be drawing people to the community, resulting in income for area stores, restaurants, gas stations and lodging.  

But more than that, we will be providing a safe place where the entire family can go for a day of recreation in the sun and fresh air.  

Law enforcement and game wardens will be able to get to know the public.

The elderly and those with disabilities will be able to get out and enjoy the beauty of natural Nebraska.


  Risks & Challenges I identified property for this facility, spent 56 weeks negotiating, completed the Business Plan, Marketing Plan, Environmental Plan and plans for each planned activities (sand volleyball, horseshoe pits, concerts, etc.)  After 56 weeks, the deal fell through... The land would have been VERY low cost, and I would not have needed this help.

These life changing solar lights are new to the market and have the power to transform lives with the click of a switch.Recent developments in solar technology have resulted in sleek, compact, portable solar lights. Lights that are affordable. Lights that give up to five hours of bright light per evening. Lights that cost only a few dollars yet last for years. Lights that save money, protect the environment and reduce indoor air pollution.  
                    
They are at the cutting edge of technology. They don't just allow children to study at night, or families to feel safe after dark: the very latest solar technology charges mobile phones. They narrow the channels of communication between communities - catalysing business and entrepreneurs in the process. 
They allow rural Africans to enter the 21st century. No longer reliant on kerosene and no longer having to walk 6 hours to charge a phone. They provide opportunity. They provide choice. They provide a platform for people to lift themselves out of poverty. To develop. To prosper. 
Help us share this technology  


           We need you. We need you to help us get these lights in to rural Africa. Every single donation counts. Every single donation will share one of these life-changing lights with a family this harvest time. You will help improve safety. You will help provide a better education. You will help prevent serious burns and accidents. You will help provide a brighter future.  And in return? You will get your name on our Lighting up Africa Wall. So everyone can see you helped create a sustainable energy legacy in Africa. You will get one of these sleek, sexy lights for yourself. To take camping, to save on electricity, to occupy your pet cat.          You may think your contribution is just a mere drop in the ocean when it comes to lighting a whole continent. But what is an ocean if not a collection of millions of little drops? Get involved. Create a brighter future Almost a million people live in the Rift Valley, Kenya - but with no electricity to light their homes, 70% are simply left in the dark. That's more than the population of Boston. We’ll be using your valuable contribution to send our teams into the Rift Valley to distribute an amazing 6000 solar lights. Timing
is everything. 
It's vital to get these life-changing, money-saving, high-performing solar lights to this farming region at the most crucial

and save hundreds of precious dollars in the years ahead.Better still, as a charity, we re-invest all income from light sales back into our work. So we match every $ you give with a $ from sales, doubling your donation. So that's double the reason to get donating ... right now!A small ask with a BIG impact With an average family size of five, distributing 6000 solar lights will bring the gift of clean light to around 30,000 people in Kenya's Rift Valley. Families will be better able to endure the dry season and children will able to study safely on long dark nights. That's not all. You’ll also be contributing to something much, much bigger. 
You'll be helping SolarAid build a sustainable solar market that will
change the lives of hundreds of millions of people living without energy -
creating jobs, providing a springboard for other forms of technology and giving Africa's next generation a brighter future. By helping to get these solar lights into rural Kenya in time
for harvest you will be joining a movement that is set to change the fortunes
of an entire continent. Eradicating the kerosene lamp from Africa 
Believe it or not, in Africa today, 600 million people live without access to
electricity. 600 million people! When the sun goes down in early evening most have no choice but to use expensive, noxious kerosene to light
their homes. 
In Kenya kerosene eats up to as much as 30% of a family’s
income - starving them of life’s essentials such as food, schooling and
medicine. Many families can’t even afford kerosene for children to study at night. If
they can, the children huddle around a dull, dangerous flame – eyes
streaming, chest scratching, inhaling fumes equivalent to smoking 40 cigarettes
a day. 
We’ve made it our goal to eradicate the kerosene lamp from
Africa by 2020. But instead of giving out aid, we sell solar lights. Because as well as retaining peoples' dignity, SolarAid wants to build a sustainable market for solar lights. With your help, thousands of families in the Rift Valley will have a chance to invest in a solar light for the first time ever - giving themselves a chance of a brighter future. You'll be helping leave an energy legacy that will transform rural Africa for years to come and banish the deadly kerosene lamp forever. 
Clean, safe solar lights - technology at its best
The modern solar lights we sell are rugged, tough and made for the rigours of rural Africa. They cost as little as $10 and last up to five years. That's around 3% of the cost of kerosene over the same period. A family investing in their own solar light can enjoy a plentiful supply of good quality, clean light – safe for children to study. And with no kerosene to buy they free up valuable income for food, education and life's other essentials. As The Economist stated: “Which plastic gadget, fitting neatly in one hand, can most quickly improve the lives of the world’s poorest people?... the solar-powered lamp.”Once a family has their first own light, everything changes. However, getting lights into remote African villages with few shops and poor transport links - the places they are needed most - is difficult and expensive. With no UPS or mail service, no Internet, newspapers or billboards, SolarAid has had to find creative ways of getting lights into communities. But we can’t do it without you.... 








Be part of a movement...transform a continent 

How did the mobile phone get in to the pockets of 644
million Africans – including some of the very poorest? Not because they were
given away but because the mobile companies created a market by building demand. 
Everyone wanted to own
a phone as soon as they saw it would revolutionise their lives. As demand grew, entrepreneurs set-up shops,
distribution evolved - and soon mobile phones were bigger than Coca-Cola. 
SolarAid is doing the same with the solar light. Our teams travel deep into rural areas to demonstrate solar lights to groups of teachers. Soon, the message trickles down to even the smallest village and once people see the massive difference solar lamps can make, they save up to buy them.
But because we're a charity, we need your help. To help us pay for the transport, the training, the offices, the people, the phones, the stock ... everything that goes in to building a sustainable market that will literally transform millions of lives. 









A simple idea can change the world 
Our novel approach is making a BIG impact and has turned the heads of industry specialists with awards from Google, Ashden and The Guardian UK. 

In fact, we have already sold and distributed over 600,000 solar
lights in remote regions of Africa – lighting the way to a brighter future for
more than 3 million people. But that is just the beginning. We need more help. 
You too can be a part of this amazing movement. Every donation you give will go towards building a sustainable future for millions of Africans – not just those in the Rift Valley but right across the continent.  

Even if you can't donate now, you can still add your passion to this amazing mission. Share this message of hope with your friends, colleagues and family by clicking the buttons below. It's as easy as flicking on a light switch! Which is just what you'll be helping millions of families in rural Africa do - switch on to fantastic safe solar, and say goodbye to kerosene forever.

I wanted a slider to film panning shots with different models of smartphones.  
I didn't want to discard it if I would change for a new model and I also wanted to film with my DSLR camera, SONY NEX-5.

<h2>We want to help you get outside</h2>
<p>Climbing is a risky sport, especially if you don't feel safe or welcomed where you go.<br/>Unreliable data, information gate-keeping, climbing jargon, violent language, harassment, discriminatory behavior— these are all too common experiences people have dealt with in our current landscape of online guidebooks.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Re-imagining climbing culture</h3>
<p>We believe it's possible to change the community culture through intentional online experiences. Whether you're a new climber feeling anxious about your first outdoor route or a seasoned adventurer needing accurate and reliable information fast, we want to build a guidebook app that liberates information and invests in our community rather than marginalizes it. </p>
<p><br/>This is our effort in evolving climbing culture.</p>

<h2>How we can make an impact</h2>
<h3>We’re creating an alternative climbing guide</h3>
<p>We are overdue for a climbing guidebook app that, at its core, prioritizes the safety of its community members. Safety looks like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being able to self-serve accurate information as a new climber with limited access to mentors on how to get started, where to go, and how to get there.</li>
<li>Access to trail accessibility data as an adaptive climber.</li>
<li>Knowing how to navigate private property and ways to be respectful to the land and the locals there.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>If you’re looking for a climbing guide with this kind of information, this is for you.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What we’re fundraising for</h3>
<p>The purpose of this fundraiser is to pay our team members an ethical rate for the research phase as we create an official proprietary design document for a different/new climbing guidebook app.</p>
<p><br/>We can't pursue a fully built out app without this first stepping stone. This document will contain our statement of intent, design prototypes, a prioritized feature list, estimated level of effort, and budget. When we are ready and backed to implement, we’ll hit the ground running with this as our guide. We'll keep the community updated through the Discovery phase on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>Any additional funds that come out of this fundraiser will go into paying for our online collaboration tool <a href=""http://miro.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Miro</a>, which has a $44.66/month fee, along with a savings that will go towards our implementation phase.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Free labor is not our norm</h3>
<p>Too often companies expect free labor when it comes to pushing Inclusion and Diversity work into their brand. But the product is also the process. Sustainable and ethical practices will be at the heart of this project, and a large part of that is justly paying people for their labor.</p>
<p><br/>Your funds will support this community norm and set the standard of what can be accomplished when folx are ethically compensated. Below are the team's hourly rates based on industry recommendations (before cost-of-living adjustments):</p>
<ul>
<li>Collaborative Research Coordinator, $50/hr</li>
<li>Product Manager, $50/hr</li>
<li>Designer, $45/hr</li>
<li>Branding, $45/hr</li>
<li>UX, $45/hr</li>
<li>Content Strategist, $45/hr</li>
<li>Frontend Developer, $55/hr</li>
<li>Backend Developer, $55/hr</li>
<li>Legal, $50/hr</li>
<li>Community Stakeholder, $45/hr</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>We will not offer equity at any stage of this project in exchange for funding. We believe an app like this should be by the community and for the community, from discovery to implementation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Here is a breakdown of our budget:</strong></p>
<p><img alt=""Donut chart showing breakdown of $6,000 budget into 7 categories. The first and largest is Leadership team with 33.5%. The second largest is UX, Design, Branding, and Content strategy with 33.1%. Frontend and Backend development consumes 11.5% of the budget. Legal and stakeholder budget is 7.5% of the total.

</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This funding will be used for our research phase and to create a proprietary design document exclusively. </p>
<p>We will need separate and larger funding to build out the app. There is the potential risk that we will be fully funded for this research phase, create the app design, but not receive enough funding to actually build out the app in the next phase. </p>
<p>However, funding this initial research phase will be the foundation to building a better, more sustainable climbing guidebook app.</p> <h2>This is just one part of the puzzle</h2>
<p>Addressing oppressive route names and monitoring online forums is one small part of the picture. Our mission is to re-imagine a more inclusive climbing community and experience, starting from the language we use when we describe and share what we're climbing.</p>
<p>We are 11 climbers, developers, designers, and community organizers from all around the United States who have expertise in universal design, web accessibility, and elevating marginalized folx in the outdoor space. We are passionate and hungry for change. But we need your help to get started.</p>

</h3><p>Releasing traditional ratchets can be a real knuckle busting experience that showcases your capacity as a finger contortionist - or lack thereof.  Especially in cold weather, when you have to take off your gloves to slip what have apparently become very fat fingers into the tiny underbelly of a ratchet smaller than the palm of your hand. Once you are in that awkward space, you have only the wiggle in the tips of your fingers to tug on a metal clip that seems to be bound up - yet again.

</h2><h2> </h2><h2>What We Need: The ""Crowdlaunch""</h2><p> </p><h3>Maintaining Momentum</h3><p><strong>We've come a long way, yet we still have a long way to go.</strong></p><p>Our goals with this IndieGoGo campaign are threefold:</p><ul>
<li>We need to develop a commercially viable product program</li>
<li>We need to gain your insights and feedback</li>
<li>We need you to pre-order your Magnet Strap today to help fund our first factory production run and retail launch</li>
</ul><h3> </h3><h3>Commercially Viable Product Program</h3><p>Take a look around and you’ll see dozens of cargo securing solutions on the market today. Endless variations can be made with minor changes to hooks, straps, or ratchets in different colors, materials, lengths, widths, etc. If we pursued every iteration that struck our fancy, we’d have an impossible number of SKUs that would bog down our production startup.</p><p>We also understand retail merchants are biased against adding a single product from a brand-new vendor to their permanent in-store selection. Instead of taking on a small mountain of paperwork, they’ll offer one-off promotional opportunities, or stick us in a regional test where we are required to significantly outperform multinational incumbents – just to get an <i>invitation</i> to compete for shelf space.</p><p>To avoid the fate of flash-in-the-pan products that were good for a quick buck, we need to be ready for fickle retailers that don’t have our best interests in mind. We can’t go into production with just the 1” S-Hook style strap and ask them to give it a shot. Instead, we need to bring them a comprehensive, commercially viable product program that appeals to key constituents across multiple demographics.</p><p>Most importantly, we need to give our early retailers a choice beyond yes or no. We need to show them a range of retail-ready solutions for them to consider, giving them some control over how they will compete in the open market.</p><p><strong>The initial Magnet Strap Family of Products (Prototypes Shown)</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1569894280/a9bfvhjmrp6ot6bmy8ce.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>Your Insights &amp; Feedback</h3><p>We have a pretty cool idea, but we are NOT all knowing. PLEASE engage with us here, on social media, or send us an email at <a href=""mailto:contact@TheMagnetStrap.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">contact@theMagnetStrap.com</a> to let us know what you think. What are we doing wrong? What are we doing right? What haven't we considered? Which feature do you love the most?</p><p>There are a number of ways to secure funding for a startup business like ours. But, we're a small team and we know that nothing will help guide us better than an actively engaged group of potential end users. If adjustments are needed, now is the time to make them, because we want you to be thrilled to buy a pack when you see them in stores.</p><p>While we hope you'll support this campaign by purchasing your favorite perk listed to the right, we also hope you'll follow us, tag us, and share our story with your friends. The more people hear about us, the more feedback we'll get before we're officially in the market.</p><h3> </h3><h3>Funding</h3><p>Trust is earned over time. Unfortunately, we don't have that luxury in our relationship with you. It is important to remember that we're not asking for long term investments in our success. We're simply asking you to believe we're up to the task of picking out a capable manufacturer, finding a reliable production facility and placing an order with both. We've already proven the design with incredibly durable working prototypes and we are confident in this product's potential commercial success. All combined, our team has well over 40 years of experience in bringing hundreds of products from concept to retail markets around the world.</p><p>With the proceeds of this campaign, we will be funding these key objectives:</p><ul>
<li>Product Testing &amp; Design</li>
<li>Packaging Development &amp; Sampling</li>
<li>Production Startup</li>
<li>Transit &amp; Distribution Expense</li>
<li>Inventory for Retail Samples/Testing and eCommerce Sales</li>

</h3><p>I’m just a regular guy who has grown weary with everyday frustrations and a lack of what I see as easy solutions that will make life <s>easier</s>… <i>better</i>. Just because we've always done it this way, doesn't mean there isn't a better way to get it done.</p><p>I feel like I have a million ideas in my head that would surely make my life an easier place to be, so I decided to get started on the Magnet Strap in my ""spare"" time and established Dank Art Enterprises. With the help and support of my amazing wife, my wonderful children, and some great friends, I'm thrilled to be making one of my ideas come to life!</p><p>It will be a dream come true when I can go into a store where most of us currently get our ratchet straps without a second thought and see the Magnet Strap alongside the products produced by industry giants. <i>We all deserve a choice between the ho hum and something better</i>. </p><h3> </h3><h3>Our Mission</h3><p><strong>Our promise to you is simple: We will always strive to Build Better Gear.</strong> Our team's goal is to create excellence in innovation for safer, smarter, better and easier-to-use tools.

<li>Just last month, we were awarded a grant by Sandia National Laboratories, which is a HUGE win for us. To make sure our design is impeccable and that everything is being manufactured to perfection, we were facing a lot of resources being devoted to testing facilities.</li>
<li>We’re told this sort of work is right up their alley and that we have a home state advantage. With scientists assigned to a project they are experienced with and are also likely to consider us as a pet project they're rooting for, we're sure to develop an impossibly robust and well-thought-out ratchet strap.</li>

<li>6 years and a couple months ago, Ed Adkins and Keith Fyhr started right here on IndieGoGo to launch Ed’s invention – the Centipede Sawhorse. Exactly 2 years later, their innovation was launched at thousands of stores nationwide, including at big box behemoths Home Depot and Lowes. Their product can now be found at around 5,000 locations in at least 24 countries across the globe.</li>
<li>As a fellow resident of Truth or Consequences in New Mexico, I’ve had the privilege of meeting Ed, and he loves the Magnet Strap. He’s bought in at a hands-on level and has been lending the full weight of his design and sourcing expertise.</li>
<li>Ed introduced me to Keith, who has also fallen in love with the concept. His product management skills and experience in all things digital are a huge weight off my shoulders.</li>
</ul><h3> </h3><h3>Ready or Not, Here we Come!</h3><p>I've been engineering and re-engineering this concept for 5 years now. In it for the long haul, I am thrilled to see things really coming together - and picking up steam! With a small team in place dedicated to helping me build momentum, the inevitability of our launch has become palpable.

</div></div>","Follow our progress at:TheMagnetStrap.com The Magnet Strap Where Have We Been All Your Life?Introducing the world's first ratchet strap tie-down with a patented magnetic hook and proprietary quick release ratchet for fast loading and easy unloading. 
Single-handedly secure cargo and equipment for transport with a hook that stays exactly where you put it while you go around the load to operate the ratchet.
A quick tug on the Quick Release Ratchet with Easy Pull Lanyard™ releases the tension upon arrival without busting your knuckles.
No matter what you're hauling, experience Loading Joy with the Magnet Strap. The Ratchet Strap DanceWe’ve all experienced the unique frustration of being invited to this dance before:Hook goes on, now throw strap over. Hook falls off; let's start over.Hook goes on, head 'round the trailer, grab thrown end, oops - hook's a bailer.Swing back 'round and put hook on. Hook falls off; feeling conned.Swing back 'round, to start the ratchet, only to learn, the hook didn't catch it.Around your partner, do-si-do; around your partner, here we go.No one knows when this waltz will end. All I know is: I need a friend! A Better Way: The Magnet Strap It's All In The Hook
We think Morpheus said it best: “What you know you can't explain, but you feel it. You've felt it your entire life, that there's something wrong with the world. You don't know what it is, but it's there, like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad.”What if I told you there is a better way? Seems like such an obvious solution, I wonder why we didn’t collectively think of it sooner: A magnetic hook! *smacks forehead*Imagine a world where a ratchet strap’s hook stays EXACTLY where you put it when you toss the strap over AND it is still there when you get to the other side! Feed it through the ratchet and start tightening - IT’S STILL THERE! What a world we could be living in! A Better Ratchet
Releasing traditional ratchets can be a real knuckle busting experience that showcases your capacity as a finger contortionist - or lack thereof.  Especially in cold weather, when you have to take off your gloves to slip what have apparently become very fat fingers into the tiny underbelly of a ratchet smaller than the palm of your hand. Once you are in that awkward space, you have only the wiggle in the tips of your fingers to tug on a metal clip that seems to be bound up - yet again. What are we, elves with slender fingers and legendary dexterity?!?The proprietary Quick Release Ratchet with Easy Pull Lanyard™ on the Magnet Strap makes it a breeze to release the ratchet with just 1 or 2 fingers. Simply hold down the top button and pull on the Lanyard - you don't even have to open the ratchet - and it will provide even tension across the brake to ensure it will not bind. Get a Grip on Non-Ferrous
We’re also going to have a stainless steel O-ring installed on every Magnet Strap to facilitate a good grip on non-ferrous trucks and trailers. A quick loop around an edge, put the hook through the ring, and you’ll hear that satiating SNAP as the hook grabs on to the ring. It will be held in place while you start tightening the ratchet, at which point the O-Ring settles in the crook of the hook to avoid uneven pressure on the magnet.A handy feature, the steel O-ring gives the Magnet Strap unparalleled versatility:
Use the O-Ring for elegant bundling of loose but long cargo, such as lumber and pipes, in a way that won't budge an inch until released.
Use the O-Rings on multiple Magnet Straps to create a telescoping cargo net of ANY size!
Securely load odds and ends with the confidence of geometry.

 What We Need: The ""Crowdlaunch"" Maintaining MomentumWe've come a long way, yet we still have a long way to go.Our goals with this IndieGoGo campaign are threefold:
We need to develop a commercially viable product program
We need to gain your insights and feedback
We need you to pre-order your Magnet Strap today to help fund our first factory production run and retail launch
 Commercially Viable Product ProgramTake a look around and you’ll see dozens of cargo securing solutions on the market today. Endless variations can be made with minor changes to hooks, straps, or ratchets in different colors, materials, lengths, widths, etc. If we pursued every iteration that struck our fancy, we’d have an impossible number of SKUs that would bog down our production startup.We also understand retail merchants are biased against adding a single product from a brand-new vendor to their permanent in-store selection. Instead of taking on a small mountain of paperwork, they’ll offer one-off promotional opportunities, or stick us in a regional test where we are required to significantly outperform multinational incumbents – just to get an invitation to compete for shelf space.To avoid the fate of flash-in-the-pan products that were good for a quick buck, we need to be ready for fickle retailers that don’t have our best interests in mind. We can’t go into production with just the 1” S-Hook style strap and ask them to give it a shot. Instead, we need to bring them a comprehensive, commercially viable product program that appeals to key constituents across multiple demographics.Most importantly, we need to give our early retailers a choice beyond yes or no. We need to show them a range of retail-ready solutions for them to consider, giving them some control over how they will compete in the open market.The initial Magnet Strap Family of Products (Prototypes Shown)  Your Insights & FeedbackWe have a pretty cool idea, but we are NOT all knowing. PLEASE engage with us here, on social media, or send us an email at contact@theMagnetStrap.com to let us know what you think. What are we doing wrong? What are we doing right? What haven't we considered? Which feature do you love the most?There are a number of ways to secure funding for a startup business like ours. But, we're a small team and we know that nothing will help guide us better than an actively engaged group of potential end users. If adjustments are needed, now is the time to make them, because we want you to be thrilled to buy a pack when you see them in stores.While we hope you'll support this campaign by purchasing your favorite perk listed to the right, we also hope you'll follow us, tag us, and share our story with your friends. The more people hear about us, the more feedback we'll get before we're officially in the market. FundingTrust is earned over time. Unfortunately, we don't have that luxury in our relationship with you. It is important to remember that we're not asking for long term investments in our success. We're simply asking you to believe we're up to the task of picking out a capable manufacturer, finding a reliable production facility and placing an order with both. We've already proven the design with incredibly durable working prototypes and we are confident in this product's potential commercial success. All combined, our team has well over 40 years of experience in bringing hundreds of products from concept to retail markets around the world.With the proceeds of this campaign, we will be funding these key objectives:
Product Testing & Design
Packaging Development & Sampling
Production Startup
Transit & Distribution Expense
Inventory for Retail Samples/Testing and eCommerce Sales
  Who We Are: Dank Art Enterprises 
This is Me, Ron Dankert
I’m just a regular guy who has grown weary with everyday frustrations and a lack of what I see as easy solutions that will make life easier… better. Just because we've always done it this way, doesn't mean there isn't a better way to get it done.I feel like I have a million ideas in my head that would surely make my life an easier place to be, so I decided to get started on the Magnet Strap in my ""spare"" time and established Dank Art Enterprises. With the help and support of my amazing wife, my wonderful children, and some great friends, I'm thrilled to be making one of my ideas come to life!It will be a dream come true when I can go into a store where most of us currently get our ratchet straps without a second thought and see the Magnet Strap alongside the products produced by industry giants. We all deserve a choice between the ho hum and something better.  Our MissionOur promise to you is simple: We will always strive to Build Better Gear. Our team's goal is to create excellence in innovation for safer, smarter, better and easier-to-use tools. We take pride in our products and we want to provide you with the best tools to accomplish the task at hand. In Our CornerSandia National Laboratories
Just last month, we were awarded a grant by Sandia National Laboratories, which is a HUGE win for us. To make sure our design is impeccable and that everything is being manufactured to perfection, we were facing a lot of resources being devoted to testing facilities.
We’re told this sort of work is right up their alley and that we have a home state advantage. With scientists assigned to a project they are experienced with and are also likely to consider us as a pet project they're rooting for, we're sure to develop an impossibly robust and well-thought-out ratchet strap.
Patent ProtectionThat’s right. We’re the only ones doing this.Simple Concept Utilizing Existing TechnologiesWe didn’t invent hooks, straps, ratchets, or magnets. Each of these components are being manufactured the world over and in some cases for hundreds of years. This isn’t a complex project fraught with potential technical difficulties.The Centipede Guys
6 years and a couple months ago, Ed Adkins and Keith Fyhr started right here on IndieGoGo to launch Ed’s invention – the Centipede Sawhorse. Exactly 2 years later, their innovation was launched at thousands of stores nationwide, including at big box behemoths Home Depot and Lowes. Their product can now be found at around 5,000 locations in at least 24 countries across the globe.
As a fellow resident of Truth or Consequences in New Mexico, I’ve had the privilege of meeting Ed, and he loves the Magnet Strap. He’s bought in at a hands-on level and has been lending the full weight of his design and sourcing expertise.
Ed introduced me to Keith, who has also fallen in love with the concept. His product management skills and experience in all things digital are a huge weight off my shoulders.
 Ready or Not, Here we Come!I've been engineering and re-engineering this concept for 5 years now. In it for the long haul, I am thrilled to see things really coming together - and picking up steam! With a small team in place dedicated to helping me build momentum, the inevitability of our launch has become palpable. You will be seeing the Magnet Strap in stores. The only question is, will you be a part of what made that possible? Please. Lend a Hand.
Pre-order your Magnet Straps today by selecting a perk to the right. Even if think you're good on straps for now, we all know one can never really have enough, and who doesn't love giving gifts?

<p><strong>FAQs</strong></p>
<p><strong>Water resistance</strong>: what does it mean? We design our bags so that you can be caught out in the rain and not worry about your laptop inside. However, if it's a monsoon, you will want to seek cover for many reasons, including avoiding rain not getting in through your zippers.</p>
<p><strong>Laptop size</strong>: Daypack has been designed to fit laptops up to a 15"" size. A lot of us use 15"" Macbook Pros and we are very happy with it. Also some people on our team use 13"" Macbook Airs and are also happy with the size. Daniel the Intern uses a Lenovo Yoga something or other and that's great too - if you're into having a touchscreen on your laptop that is. The maximum area of the laptop 15 Inches high, 10 inches wide. (38cm X 25cm)</p>
<p><strong>Where is the material collected from</strong>: The first batch will be collected within 5kms of the coastlines of the Maldives, and the second batch will be collected from the Philippines. Your bag will come with information about where the plastic came from that made your bag.</p>
<p><strong>What does the material feel like?</strong> It's surprisingly soft to the touch, yet durable.</p>
<p><strong>How much stuff can I fit in it? </strong>It's a similar size to many everyday backpacks: a laptop, a textbook or two, a sweater, powerbank, some cables, and a charger for your laptop will fit no problem. Then there's space on the side for your water bottle on one side, and umbrella on the other.</p>
<p><strong>What is Kickstarter? </strong>Kickstarter is not a store. Kickstarter is a way to fund projects with big goals. We are funding this through Kickstarter because we believe there is a huge community around the world that wants to see the oceans healthier. The way it works is this: if you are interested in the campaign, you mark down your pledge today, along with your credit card. You are not charged today. Your credit card is only charged if the campaign is successful, at which point you will be charged by Kickstarter on November 29th.</p>
<p><strong>How do I know I will receive my product?</strong> This is our 4th Kickstarter campaign, and reputation is very important to us. We have thousands of backers from all over the world that have believed in us, and we have delivered the products to them. In some instances, goods can't be shipped to certain countries, at which point we will refund any amount paid by you. We're so dedicated to our backers, that last year, our founder Adrian wore leopard print pants every day to prove to our backers that he was doing everything he could to get products to everyone, and he wore them until all bags were received! It took 9 months for all the final bags to be shipped - and he held to his word!</p>

Daniel the Intern uses a Lenovo Yoga something or other and that's great too - if you're into having a touchscreen on your laptop that is. The maximum area of the laptop 15 Inches high, 10 inches wide. (38cm X 25cm)
Where is the material collected from: The first batch will be collected within 5kms of the coastlines of the Maldives, and the second batch will be collected from the Philippines. Your bag will come with information about where the plastic came from that made your bag.
What does the material feel like? It's surprisingly soft to the touch, yet durable.
How much stuff can I fit in it? It's a similar size to many everyday backpacks: a laptop, a textbook or two, a sweater, powerbank, some cables, and a charger for your laptop will fit no problem. Then there's space on the side for your water bottle on one side, and umbrella on the other.
What is Kickstarter? Kickstarter is not a store. Kickstarter is a way to fund projects with big goals. We are funding this through Kickstarter because we believe there is a huge community around the world that wants to see the oceans healthier. The way it works is this: if you are interested in the campaign, you mark down your pledge today, along with your credit card. You are not charged today. Your credit card is only charged if the campaign is successful, at which point you will be charged by Kickstarter on November 29th.
How do I know I will receive my product? This is our 4th Kickstarter campaign, and reputation is very important to us. We have thousands of backers from all over the world that have believed in us, and we have delivered the products to them. In some instances, goods can't be shipped to certain countries, at which point we will refund any amount paid by you. We're so dedicated to our backers, that last year, our founder Adrian wore leopard print pants every day to prove to our backers that he was doing everything he could to get products to everyone, and he wore them until all bags were received! It took 9 months for all the final bags to be shipped - and he held to his word!

Shipment Information:
Once the campaign has ended, you will be emailed a survey to select your color of choice along with the options to include any add ons. We plan on getting you your rewards by the end of May 2019. Shipping is included for the U.S. and Canada. Hong Kong and Singapore have reduced shipping rates due to our popularity in HK + SG. All duties for shipments to the U.S. are covered by us. Some countries may face additional local duties by the customs agent in that country - this will not be covered and may come at an additional cost to you.

<p>The PRAETOR POCKETBLADE is the result of combining the<strong> adaptability and convenience</strong> of a utility blade with the <strong>rugged durability and strength </strong>of a fixed blade knife.  The blade housing is precision milled from a solid block of carbon fiber composite giving the Praetor unparalleled strength and lightness for the most demanding and precise daily tasks.  Light as a feather and strong as titanium, we designed the Praetor to strike a perfect balance between ergonomics, durability and strength.  </p>

<h3><strong style=""background-color: transparent;"">A Rugged &amp; Dependable Fixed Blade</strong></h3>
<p style=""background-color: transparent;"">The Praetor is compact and powerful cutting tool, designed with aggressive ergonomics around the ubiquitous utility blade for precision cutting and hard use.  The vast majority of blade holders are made from cheap, low quality, mass produced plastics and aluminum, loosely securing the blade itself which leads to unsafe slippage and rattling.  </p>
<p><strong>In contrast, the Praetor design tightly compresses the blade into a solid carbon fiber frame, locking it into place.  No more cheap rattling.  </strong></p>
<p style=""background-color: transparent;"">We designed the Praetor to be the highest quality, most advanced utility knife on the market  using the most premium composite materials in the world.  </p>

<p> </p>
<h3 style=""background-color: transparent;"">How Does it Work?</h3>
<p style=""background-color: transparent;"">The Praetor magnetically locks itself into place without the need to fumble with any latches, straps, buttons or slides.  The fixed blade...evolved for the 21st century.  </p>

<h3 style=""background-color: transparent;"">A Unique Magnetic Mechanism</h3>
<p><strong>Simply twist to disengage magnetic lock</strong></p>
<p>Countersunk high-grade neodymium magnets embedded in the composite frame ensure the knife cannot slip out by accident.</p>
<p><strong style=""background-color: transparent;"">Automatically re-engages lock if knife is not removed</strong></p>
<p>With no moving parts and the use of magnets the Praetor sheath system is able to strike a perfect balance between ease-of-access and robust security.</p>
<p style=""background-color: transparent;""><strong>Free your pockets</strong></p>
<p style=""background-color: transparent;"">The sheath design provides the flexibility to clip securely to either your inner belt for ultimate security or to the inside of a pocket, whichever is preferred.</p>

<p><strong>Replaceable blades</strong></p>
<p style=""background-color: transparent;"">Being able to quickly swap blades is an indispensable feature of every utility knife.  No more time consuming and delicate sharpening operations on dull, thick blades or worrying about chipping a full-sized knife in practical daily use.  The Praetor Pocketblade can rip and tear into any material in any condition, swap a blade and keep on going.  </p>
<p><strong>Solid all-weather composite construction</strong></p>
<p style=""background-color: transparent;"">The Praetor and its sheath system are engineered from high performance composites like carbon fiber which has an unmatched strength-to-weight ratio making it the perfect material for a hand-held cutting tool.  Composites will never degrade from rust or oxidation so it can handle any outdoor environment with ease. </p>

</div></div>","The PRAETOR POCKETBLADE is the result of combining the adaptability and convenience of a utility blade with the rugged durability and strength of a fixed blade knife.  The blade housing is precision milled from a solid block of carbon fiber composite giving the Praetor unparalleled strength and lightness for the most demanding and precise daily tasks.  Light as a feather and strong as titanium, we designed the Praetor to strike a perfect balance between ergonomics, durability and strength.

A Rugged & Dependable Fixed Blade
The Praetor is compact and powerful cutting tool, designed with aggressive ergonomics around the ubiquitous utility blade for precision cutting and hard use.  The vast majority of blade holders are made from cheap, low quality, mass produced plastics and aluminum, loosely securing the blade itself which leads to unsafe slippage and rattling.  
In contrast, the Praetor design tightly compresses the blade into a solid carbon fiber frame, locking it into place.  No more cheap rattling.  
We designed the Praetor to be the highest quality, most advanced utility knife on the market  using the most premium composite materials in the world.  
 

 
How Does it Work?
The Praetor magnetically locks itself into place without the need to fumble with any latches, straps, buttons or slides.  The fixed blade...evolved for the 21st century.  



 
A Unique Magnetic Mechanism
Simply twist to disengage magnetic lock
Countersunk high-grade neodymium magnets embedded in the composite frame ensure the knife cannot slip out by accident.
Automatically re-engages lock if knife is not removed
With no moving parts and the use of magnets the Praetor sheath system is able to strike a perfect balance between ease-of-access and robust security.
Free your pockets
The sheath design provides the flexibility to clip securely to either your inner belt for ultimate security or to the inside of a pocket, whichever is preferred.








Carbon Fiber Suspension Clip
Bonus with Tier II & III Reward Levels
Prevent your keys and EDC from bunching uncomfortably at the bottom of your pocket. 
A suspension clip is a a low-profile and lightweight way to carry your basic daily gear.  Being made from carbon fiber, these clips are the absolute lightest and strongest clips you'll find anywhere.
The inspiration for these clips came during the manufacturing process of the Praetor blade frames.  We realized we could be more efficient with material by milling these carbon fiber clips in the excess material along side the blade frames.






CHOOSE from SIX Tier III Knife Color Styles

Carbon Fiber
""Venom"" Green
""Ronin"" Orange
Olive Drab
Matte Black
Coyote Brown

 
Horizontal Carry Kit Included
The Praetor magnetic sheath system is designed to be highly customizable and able to be tailored to individual carry style preferences.  We've developed a horizontal carry attachment kit which enables you to stow your Praetor within the width of your belt (up to 1.5"") as an alternative to the default IWB (inside-waistband) carry style.  The kit will include adjustment spacers so you can easily tailor your Praetor sheath to the thickness of your belt.
 


 

 

Replaceable blades
Being able to quickly swap blades is an indispensable feature of every utility knife.  No more time consuming and delicate sharpening operations on dull, thick blades or worrying about chipping a full-sized knife in practical daily use.  The Praetor Pocketblade can rip and tear into any material in any condition, swap a blade and keep on going.  
Solid all-weather composite construction
The Praetor and its sheath system are engineered from high performance composites like carbon fiber which has an unmatched strength-to-weight ratio making it the perfect material for a hand-held cutting tool.  Composites will never degrade from rust or oxidation so it can handle any outdoor environment with ease. 

Type: Fixed Blade
Blade Length: ≈2.5"" inches 
Blade Thickness: .024 inches (0.61 mm)
Blade Type(s):   Custom laser etched STANLEY® FATMAX® Carbide 11-800, FATMAX® 11-700 and Heavy Duty 1992® 11-921 blades, (generic blades will have varying degrees of blade fit)
Total Length: 5.0 inches (127 mm)
Frame Material: Carbon Fiber and G10 composite
Hardware: Black Oxide 18-8 Stainless Steel 
Weight: ≈1.2 oz (33 g)





 
A Cutting Tool for the Everyday
The Praetor is a working knife, designed to be at home in a workshop, in your daily carry or just in a box on your fridge for those household projects.



 
Designed For Use With Workgloves 
The large finger hole integrated into the handle makes operation of the Praetor a breeze in winter or other adverse environments where manual dexterity becomes an issue, or if your day to day work requires the use of heavy gloves.





Manufactured by the designers. Zero outsourcing. 100% control of our design. Production ready at launch.  
These are the standards all of our previous campaigns have held to and the Praetor is no exception.  I'm a maker at heart and this translates into practical and innovative designs that follow a clean and efficient manufacturing process.  I believe that manufacturability is a core design pillar of any product, no matter how small, and this translates into precise, stable production.
Our machine shop specializes in carbon fiber milling so we are fully equipped with the best tooling and processes for the job after multiple successful campaigns.

 
Production Ready
The Praetor Pocketblade has been fully funded through our recently successful kickstarter campaign and we want to bring the design to the indiegogo community.  We've produced many batches of early production units throughout our Kickstarter campaign and production is continuing in earnest.
Indiegogo backers will have their Praetor's shipped immediately after our previous campaigns units are produced.  Our current shipping timeline is an estimate based on previous production runs and we will work as hard as we can to ship earlier if possible.

<h3>UPDATE #2:</h3>
<p>Still on target to ship on 12/17.  They came out great, by the way.</p>
<h3>POST CAMPAIGN UPDATE:</h3>
<p>Wow!  This campaign really exceeded my expectations--thanks to EVERYONE who supported this project in any way. I am very grateful.<br/>As of 12/12/12, the blue pieces have been received and are at the engraver.  The reds go there tomorrow morning and the gun-metal in the afternoon.  I will spend the weekend working on magnets and putting together orders.  On Monday I will ship the US orders via 2-day Priority Mail. If you are in Colorado, you should be receiving your perks on Tuesday.  INTERNATIONAL will take 1-3 weeks (unless you have made prior arrangements to receive your order sooner.)<br/>Please check out the GrOpener page on Facebook and Twitter for regular updates.<br/>Thanks again!</p>
<h3>SHIPPING</h3>
<p>US Domestic Shipping is included. </p>
<p>International Shipping is included IF you don't need it by the Holidays.  1-3 weeks from the ship date to the delivery date through your national postal service.</p>
<h3>All You Need is a Firm Grip</h3>
<p>This device does not require a lot of strength, but a firm grip is necessary.  It is not a helpful tool for grandma's arthritis or for a kindergartner.  Think a firm, but not crushing, handshake.</p>
<h3>How The GrOpener Happened</h3>
<p>The idea for this project was born in Ghana where I was teaching art with the Peace Corps.  Every bar had these cool, hand-made openers consisting of a piece of wood with a couple of screws stuck in it.  The screws hooked under the cap and the cap was pried off as you press down on the wood...it was brilliant!  Over time, I thought about different configurations on this principle.  One handed is a natural way to configure an opener that is pressed down towards the bottle.  I developed it until the form and balance worked with the motion of the hand.</p>
<p>I am an editorial photographer with a background in the visual arts.  I have applied my art discipline to product design before. In 2007 I designed and launched another product, the Zoot Snoot. This is a device made from neoprene that has been popular in a niche dealing with flash photography (it is available at adorama.com, lightwaredirect.com, and zootsnoot.com).</p>
<p>I live where I grew up in Denver, Colorado with Jenn and our son Gerik--who generously offered his art as a backdrop in the photo and video.</p>
<h3>The Goal &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>I have already paid for the tooling and the first 200 linear feet of extrusion.  Where I need your help is in covering the cost of cutting and finishing the GrOpeners.  If I don't reach my goal of $4000, I will use what I raise to cut and finish what I can of the extrusions, so I can fulfill the orders that are made.</p>
<p>Contribute now, using the buttons to the right and I will send you the perks of your contribution level. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why is the GrOpener Important?</h3>
<p>It is unique that this tool uses motion and force from the act of grabbing the bottle to achieve the additional result of removing the cap.  But, it is special in that it has been designed in a way that accommodates amputees, stroke victims and others who may only have full use of one hand.</p>

But, more importantly, backpacks are bulky when compared to sling bags.  (3) Sling bags are lightweight and convenient, but most are too small to carry large-size electronics such laptops, tablets, and forget about camera or gaming gear.(4) It’s 2018!

During a trip to France, we found ourselves in need of a bag that would accommodate our frequent travels and on-the-go lifestyles. However, to our surprise, we could not find anything that was both functional at organizing our packed items and stylish enough to use in professional settings. We heard many similar stories from friends and travelers who lead fast paced, dynamic lives, with varied needs and on-the go demands. They needed a solution that would not slow them down anymore, nor simply keep up with it, but would proactively make things easier. So, upon returning home, we vowed to invent such a bag. </p><p>We founded Torba with one simple mission: to blend “out of the box” design with a relentless attention to detail, in order to craft functional, easy to use products that get frequent travelers and urban commuters excited about each upcoming trip. </p><p>With many iterations, prototypes, and hard work EZ_Duffle was born! Keeping ease of use and superior organization as the top design priority, EZ_Duffle is Torba’s first product - the one bag to organize it all.</p><div data-id=""16744721""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""Stencils, materials, grades, colours, putting it all together and visiting factories to select the BEST suppliers."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1498596237/r93e5hqfic231pn08m17.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><figcaption>Stencils, materials, grades, colours, putting it all together and visiting factories to select the BEST suppliers.</figcaption></figure></div><p> </p><div data-id=""16758233""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1498596238/wmdemuixn5i2qnatcf65.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></figure></div><div>

Full visibility and access to grab your laptop, clothes, and anything else. Quick-flap gives you instant access to the main compartment and the Spill-free toiletry pocket.  Smart pocket gives you instant access and houses the cord to charge your phone on the go. Magnetized side flaps provide grab-n-go access to EZ_Duffle's side modules and can be secured shut with the zipper closing.Large side hatches on either rear side of the bag can be opened fully to store and retrieve items from the side compartments. Side pockets provide instant access to quick grab items.  

Three ways to partition EZ_Duffle’s interior. It adapts to you.

Your life is diverse and versatile; it’s time that you have a bag that can keep up. 
Easy to clip on and off interior dividers provide for three interior layout options. Collapse or remove them.  Use both interior dividers to obtain three compartments for maximal organization on short trips or in your daily grind.Collapse or remove either of the two interior dividers to create extra space for greater flexibility. The unique twist & fold structure compacts the bag to a fraction of its size without crushing it and without having to remove the interior modules! Bring it with you, throw it in your luggage, car, closet, etc.   
Don’t worry about your smartphone or tablet dying in the middle of a trip or just before an important meeting.

Charge on the go with integrated cord loops for battery, powered smart-pocket & find items in the dark with LED lighting. 
Stay powered. Stay strong. Stay lit.
 A dedicated battery pocket and a hidden cord channel provide flexibility to install your own battery and charge up your devices on the go, or get the EZ Battery Kit* to create your optimal portable charging system. The battery pocket is made of a flexible material to fit batteries up to 3.9"" width x 7.9"" height (10cm X 20cm). *EZ Battery Kit Includes:
1 x removable battery

*The EZ Battery Kit is available as part of the No Brainer Bundle.  Built-in LEDs are independent of the Battery Kit. Use the LEDs to light up the side and main compartments for those late nights. Activated by a button, LEDs are powered by small lithium batteries. The LED battery is included and replaceable. 

Stop hurting your back with inflexible & uncomfortable carry. 

Choose your position from three distinct carry modes: throw it over the shoulder, grab it in hand, swing it around.
Use the dedicated snap-on chest strap to quickly transform the duffle bag into a backpack for those quick moves through the airport or city. Six shoulder strap hooks offer seven strap positions, to optimize your comfort.  The shoulder strap comes padded, adjustable with nylon seatbelt webbing construction. Side grab handle is great for sliding the bag in and out of tight spaces like the car or an overhead compartment. Strong magnets keep the handles tightly connected when needed and allow for easy and quick unclipping to access the bag. Take on bad weather. Take on rough terrains. Take on adversity. Superior scratchproof and waterproof PU is used to ensure a long-lasting life to the bag and protect your belongings. Waterproof zippers are used for all outer closures.  Thick and durable PU material is used for the handles to ensure resilience even under repeated heavy loads. A waterproof and shock resistant base to protect your belongings through all your adventures. The Limited Lifetime warranty will cover any manufacturing defect. For the electronics, a 1-year standard, parts and labor warranty will apply.       
It all started in 2014 ... During a trip to France, we found ourselves in need of a bag that would accommodate our frequent travels and on-the-go lifestyles. However, to our surprise, we could not find anything that was both functional at organizing our packed items and stylish enough to use in professional settings. We heard many similar stories from friends and travelers who lead fast paced, dynamic lives, with varied needs and on-the go demands. They needed a solution that would not slow them down anymore, nor simply keep up with it, but would proactively make things easier. So, upon returning home, we vowed to invent such a bag. We founded Torba with one simple mission: to blend “out of the box” design with a relentless attention to detail, in order to craft functional, easy to use products that get frequent travelers and urban commuters excited about each upcoming trip. With many iterations, prototypes, and hard work EZ_Duffle was born! Keeping ease of use and superior organization as the top design priority, EZ_Duffle is Torba’s first product - the one bag to organize it all.Stencils, materials, grades, colours, putting it all together and visiting factories to select the BEST suppliers. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MANUFACTURING & FULFILLMENT: 
We have secured our manufacturers, shippers and fulfillment centers, all of whom are waiting for us to give them the green light! Our manufacturers are professional, precise and ethical.
Our freight forwarders move tons of product daily and are ready for our business. We have partnered up with one of the industry's leading fulfillment centers so our backers will get the EZ_Duffle in pristine condition and on time.
With all of that being said, we must note that unforeseen complications do occasionally arise. Natural disasters or accidents are unavoidable. We’ve constructed our timelines with reasonable accommodations for unforeseen events, and EZ_Duffle will be insured throughout every step of its arrival to your doorstep.
DUTIES & TAXES: 
We cannot mark your pre-order as gift, this is illegal, so we will not be able to do this.
Our prices do not include VAT, GST or other country taxes.
Some international backers will be subject to import duty and taxes. These backers will be responsible for covering all of their local duties and taxes. Import duties and taxes are not covered by this campaign.
As we are shipping these products all over the world, it is impossible for us to build in the various duties, VAT and GST tax for each location.
LIKENESS OF PRODUCT:
The EZ_Duffle you are seeing on this page is a final prototype and therefor is very close to the finished product! The finished product will be of even higher quality materials, so if you like what you see here then you will love what you’ll receive in person! We will notify you every step of the way of any design improvements that will be implemented into the final EZ_Duffle product.
WARRANTY:
All EZ_Duffles are covered by our Limited Lifetime warranty to cover any manufacturing defect. For the electronics, a 1-year standard, parts and labor warranty will apply.",65.0,1,"1 Campaign

They will keep your hands nice and cozy — even in extreme cold. 
  The Frontier Mitten can also be hand-waxed for increased leather longevity and weatherproofing.The premium grade A (best quality possible) cow leather is an essential element in the Frontier Mittens and gives them an incredible functional temperature range. The Frontier Mittens won’t fail you. They’ll last you a lifetime, so give’r all you got!Cold-weather hand accessories is what we do and how we built our name. We’re straight out of Jackson Hole, Wyoming — so we know a thing or two about the cold.Our customers soon asked us to make a heavy-duty, extreme weather mitten - this is our answer.Our mission, as a company, is to empower you to give it your all, no matter your passion. We design innovative products to make this pursuit more accessible and enjoyable. We believe that everyone can Give’r, and the more each of us can honor our unique journeys, the greater the spread of radical positivity in our world.The development and creation of the Frontier Mitten is the manifestation of this mission — the protection, comfort and confidence to explore and expand the frontiers of your outdoor work and play.Cold hands, and even the fear of cold hands, is universally understood to be a negative experience. This fear often holds us back. We shy away from possibility and opportunity that exist in our own individual frontiers, outside of our comfort zones.Our roots in the Rocky Mountain frontier country here in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, has us continually stretching our capabilities and challenging what is possible, while learning to ebb and flow with all of Mother Nature’s curve balls and extremes.The Frontier Mitten is the best damn mittens you’ll ever get. We’re sure of it, with the last two years of testing in JH to prove it. They’re meant to add to your arsenal of cold weather gear to get your work done, get your shred in, and give’r your all.Gloves provide the dexterity you need for fine-motor tasks and are certainly an essential piece of gear. But when temperatures drop to extremes and staying warm becomes your first priority, you can count on the Give’r Frontier Mittens.Because the spaces between your fingers aren’t exposed to the cold as they would with gloves,  the Frontier Mittens drastically decrease the amount of heat dissipated out from your body. The minimized external surface area decreases your body’s exposure to cold and, therefore, retains more warmth in your fingers and hands.The Frontier Mittens also keep your fingers together so they can share body warmth. This allows the inside of the mitten to work a bit like a furnace. Your fingers and hands circulate heat to each other while the mittens keep it all in, letting your body retain its optimal functional temperature with less effort.Give’r tested the Frontier Mittens in the most extreme conditions so you don’t have to. They’ve given their seal of approval for temperatures ranging from -40°F to 400°F. So no matter the situation, these puppies have got you covered.Forged in the valley of Jackson Hole, Wyoming, home of the iconic Teton Mountain Range, the Frontier Mittens have come face to palm with snow, rain, wind, hail, dirt, frost, mud, sleet, ice, fire and also a fair amount of time under the sun. They’ve handled granite, steel, concrete and rebar and have come out strong and unbroken. Tested to the extremes? Check.Each level of the insulation system was thoroughly tested and selected to work together and ensure insane warmth that feels AMAZING.When it comes to design, warmth, protection and your hands...we give a FIT!The Frontier Mitten design ensures you get the perfect fit.  As they’re worn, your hands and fingers gradually form, shape and settle the insulation system, resulting in a mitten that molds to your hands. The outcome — an unparalleled, custom-made fit that gets better the more you wear them, just like your favorite baseball mitt growing up. The core of Give’r glove/mitten design since the beginning, we believe things should get better with time and use, and should last a lifetime. Between leather shell and insulation layering system lies the Hipora Membrane - ensuring your mittens are 100% waterproof.  This technology is proven to keep water out while remaining breathable for water vapor to escape.The technology of the layer utilizes microscopic perforations in the membrane that are small enough to keep water in liquid form out, but large enough to allow water vapor and sweat to escape.See it and believe it — we’ve put them to the waterproof test, so you can be confident to Give’r!If you want, we can also bake & hand-wax your Frontier Mittens with an all-natural beeswax. This naturally “bomb-proofs” your mittens —increasing leather longevity, retaining natural moisture content and enhancing weatherproofing.Bonus: the bombproofing ensures they’ll arrive at your doorstep looking rugged and bad ass! The exterior of each pair of mittens is made solely with 100% premium Grade-A cowhide leather, which runs circles around its synthetic brethren. Leather is far superior with grip than any other materials or hybrids. We’ve tested the Frontier Mittens when wet and cold and put them to the grind with a huge range of materials. These mittens will put an end to having plastics, metals, woods or your ski poles slip through your hands when you’re given’r!In addition, we tested out multiple “thumb styles” to ensure you get the absolute best grip. We opted for the Keystone Style Thumb to give you maximum grip capability and comfort with fit and function.The Frontier Mittens will outlast any pair of mittens you’ve had to date.  Durability and longevity are at the core of the design. We’ve sewn on additional leather reinforcement patches in areas that experience high abrasion - such as the palm, fingertips and thumbs.Our team believes in making products that will last — we don’t cut corners to ensure you’ll have the Frontier Mittens for years to come and, perhaps (if you’re feeling generous), pass ‘em on to your grandchildren. Put these bad boys through hell - they'll come back ready for more.The premium cow leather exterior enables an incredible functional temperature range. The Frontier Mitten can survive not just through extreme cold but also extreme heat.In fact, where most synthetic mittens melt at high temperatures, the Frontier Mitten can handle the heat! They’ve been tested to temperatures up to 400°F.From icy waters to burning coals — the Frontier Mittens have been tested so YOU can give'r with confidence.Cow leather is well known for its long lifespan and durability. In fact, our prototypes have lasted 3x longer or more than any synthetic mitten alternatives. Complementing the insulation, as the Frontier Mittens mature, the leather shapes and forms a memory for your hands while developing a beautiful patina.These are mittens you can pass down through generations. Break ‘em in, beat ‘em up, and let the leather tell your story.We included an elastic cuff and leather skirt to keep warmth in and snow and ice out. The leather pull tab on the cuff makes it easy to put on and take off the mittens without damaging them.Don’t lose these beauties off the chair lift or end up with a single mitten, the steel D-Ring is clutch for safe-keeping! Attach a leash, pair ‘em together or clip to your pack with confidence. The clip is placed strategically to prevent damage and provide maximum utility. You have the choice to get your Frontier Mittens hand-waxed with natural beeswax. Each mitten will be personally treated and baked by us. Give your pair a look that is as tough as the mittens themselves.The hand-waxing enhances the leather’s durability and performancewhile increasing the outer leather layer weatherproofing. In essence, “bomb-proofing” these beasts so you can give’r proper!
Claim your mittens as your own! In proper western fashion, we take great pride in our workmanship, attention to detailand ability to hand brand your initials on each of your mittens.This customization is the real deal and will make sure everyone knows these are YOUR mittens — ensuring you don’t lose ‘em or have them running off in your buddies or kids’ gear bag.Don’t let the cold, or fear of cold, prevent you from experiencing life and doing what you love. Whether you’re skiing or boarding your favorite hill, walking your dog, relaxing on the chair lift, out on the boat with your crew, riding your sled through the “white room”, or ice fishin’ at your favorite spot, the Give’r Frontier MIttens will make sure your hands stay dry and warm, so you can give’r all you got and soak in the good stuff! When you select to support our campaign, you can choose the reward tier that best suits you.Note that any tier with Frontier Mittens (as a single unit, 2-Pack, etc.) as a reward will be produced and shipped to you within the stated timeline of that tier.The details of the sizing selection, add-ons of the wax coating and initial branding will be communicated following the completion of the campaign. We have been working on the Frontier Mitten concept for years, with an intense focus on prototype testing & iteration these last 18 months. We’ve been working with all supply chain partners for 4+ years, and they’re as stoked as we are. We have put a lot of thought into these beauties and what is needed to execute on the production, shipment, and game plan to get into backers’ hands ASAP with winter knocking on the door.  We have run the spreadsheets, readied our waxing and branding muscles, and ensured that all is in place to GIVE’R once our goal is reached!Use the Wrist to Middle Finger Tip measurement and find the Palm Circumference intersection on the sizing table. This is your size!If you're measuring in centimeters, use this chart! to find your size.This Wrist to Middle Finger Tip measurement is the best indicator of your size and should guide your selection. Not all hands are the same size and if you’re deciding between sizes, we recommend sizing up.It all began in 2011 with the design and creation of custom hats commemorating an epic annual kayaking expedition in Ontario, Canada. These hats, featuring the skyline of the Tetons and the colloquial phrase “give’r”, were the seed from which Give’r was born. This team, with help from an awesome and ever-growing community, gave life to a philosophy and lifestyle that is perfectly embodied by everything we make - especially the Frontier Mittens.Our product line began with two t-shirts, two hats and a commitment to our customers that we’d stop at nothing to ensure they were stoked (not just satisfied) with their Give’r Gear. Our dream has come to life through 7+ years of working multiple jobs, taking challenges head-on, continuously learning, receiving a tremendous amount of help, and our belief that the world is a better place with Give’r in it.We strongly believe in giving back through service and financial support, and have worked with dozens of local, regional, national and international non-profits since our inception. We believe in forming community by working with local businesses and connecting our customers from across the globe. We are proud members of 1% for the Planet and 1% for the Tetons, and are committed to playing an active role in making the world a better place for generations to come.Our goal is to bring to life the Give’r that lives within us all. Straightforward, fun, comfortable apparel and accessories were at our core on day one, and we have built upon this foundation over the last 7 years. Your support enables our team to be fully dedicated to Give’r while maintaining control of our mission and the ability to take risks that may not be possible through traditional fundraising means.We invite you to join us in continuously appreciating life and celebrating the journey. When life asks you to dance, we urge you to give’r.",88.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<br/></span></div></div>","Hi, I'm Chena. Now let me show you who Allan is!

I met Allan in
Vancouver, Canada. I was studying photography, he was a bike courier. And, because life is amazing, we ended up living in the same house. 


Allan to the far right and me with the orange shirt with our homies at 1607's kitchen.
We lived a
year together, time in which he shared his bike riding passion with
me. It would go like this:




-Hey Chena,
let's go for a bike ride.
-But it's
midnight...
-Follow me!
-Ok.


Eventually he introduced me to the Bike Rides Society, where every Thursday at eight, a
bunch of crazy cool people would meet and ride for two hours around
the city, every time stopping at a mistery destination.
 





One day, we were floating in circles riding
spongy tubes at the public pool, and the idea came to me...ALLAN! COME AND LIVE WITH ME IN
MEXICO! I convinced him that he absolutely had to add some
guacamole in his life. So he did. 





But
he did it the Allan way, riding his bike from Van to Tijuana, were he wish he
had seen the donkey show, but not really. He then flew to Mexico
City, bike in a box, four T-shirts in his backpack, where I waited
for him for our 2nd round to begin: Allan and
Chena in Aztecalandia! Wahoo.


Me, being a
car driver, and knowing how crazy surreal my city is, I
asked Little Baby Jesus to protect Allan
while riding through this concrete jungle. But he was ok, even in the Pizzacat Alleycat he participated at the first week or so after he arrived to Mexico. Look at this madness:



Pretty soon he
found a job being a bike courier at Los Loosers, vegan food delivered on a bike.  Allan ended up
knowing my city in ways that I've never done, and I think I never
will...at the end he even guided me around haha.  

Amazing for someone whose only word in Spanish was quesadilla! :)
Here's another one of Allan working for Los Loosers (subtitles available!):

After trying all the types of tacos available, flying through the city 



and cooking for us the Scottish national dish, haggis,



...it was time
for him to go and juice his Canadian work visa! Again, he was
not just gonna fly and cry emotionally in the plane reading my
goodbye letter. He was gonna ride home from NY to Vancouver!



You can check his Instagram feed: allanshawphoto, for some amazing pictures and incredible stories. 
Here's a video he sent to me last week:

Allan started his adventure on the 4th of August 2014.  Im writing this on the 30th of September, and he
will be back to the loving arms of Mother Canada, as he says, this week!


I asked him,
in average, how long does it take to cross the States riding a bike
like he did. In average, he says, it's about 3 months, and he's doing
it in less than 7 weeks!

And,
after all that epicness, 
his bike finally broke. 




Pics from Allan's IGWith almost zero pesos or dollars in his pockets, sunburnt and tired, but ravishingly happy, we think Allan deserves a new bike. 
It's not only the incredible feat he's about to accomplish, crossing from ocean to ocean by himself most of the time, but how commited he is to his passion. 
You can see in his Instagram stories how excited he is about life, and how he enjoyed every moment of it. And that is something we want to see in people more often!
We think he's a true inspiration, and I would be delighted to know he can continue his adventures as long as those strong legs of his can go!

What we can do
His current crappy bike he bought for 100 bucks a year ago, and he has already put together around 12,000 miles with it. 
It's time for a very happy change!
This campaign is to collect money to buy a super cool super fabulous super chido bike to give to Allan when he ends his journey and returns to Vancouver. I can imagine the size of his smile! And his little happy dance as well.
I asked him what his golden dream bike would be:


Mr Pink from All-City bikes. I don't know much about it, only that it's super fast! For those of you who know, these are the specs:

This bike is $1,899 dls (told you it was super cool) at the Counterbalance Bicycles shop in Seattle, Washington (it's the closest dealer to Vancouver, so Allan would be going down to Seattle to pick it up). 
""This is the frame that won the 2013 Gravel World Championships and has been campaigned in all manner of crits, road races, fondos and gravel events. "" 
So, I'm asking for $2,000 dls. to cover for the rates Indiegogo keeps for the funds raised. Of course, feel free to donate as little or as much as your heart desires! Good vibes are welcome too. 
In the case we don't get all the money, I'm absolutely sure Allan would use however much we collect to buy at least some new bike shoes! (last time I saw him I could see his toes as well). 

  Risks & Challenges
Indiegogo asks me to write risks & challenges...but really, the only obstacle I can imagine for Allan getting that bike is if he suddenly went crazy and decided instead he wants to run forever like Forrest Gump. 
Allan won 44th place at the CMWC MEXICO and the 17th place at the NACCC MINNEAPOLIS. That talent is goint nowhere!
I called the bike shop today and this nice guy told me the bikes are still going to be there by the end of the month... so, nope, no real risks or challenges.

<h2>How was the idea born?</h2>
<p>“For many years now, I have been organizing for my clients interested in traveling and photography inspiring and original expeditions focused on discovering exotic countries through the viewfinders of their cameras. Together, we have visited six continents and places as diverse as the major US national parks, South Africa, Iceland, Peru, New Zealand or China. From every trip, I bring not only amazing memories, but also beautiful photographs. I love sharing my experience, but I cannot possibly take everyone with me on an expedition. And I got an IDEA! I decided to create an app to share all those beautiful places I have visited on this planet along with tips on how to photograph them. I named the app Fripito,” said Jan, professional photographer and founder of Fripito.</p>

After many late nights researching &amp; designing they launched “The Best Toiletry Bag For Traveling”  - making an organized, compact, &amp; easier way to travel light.</p><p>Goodness gracious...we raised over $200k in crowdfunding and Gravel has now shipped thousands of our bags to 65+ countries around the world. We’re blown away and humbled. Backers like you brought Gravel to life. This time around, <b>with your help</b>, we’re making our best products even better.</p><p><b>We're here for our second Indiegogo campaign</b>.

Why the name Gravel? You know that sound when your tires leave the pavement for a dirt road? That's where the adventure begins, that's Gravel. Dirt roads have led us to some our favorite places in the world - hot springs, mountain trails, and beautiful scenic routes. To us, Gravel is the means to take us somewhere amazing.
Introducing The Explorer PLUS (aka The Expeditioner)What Is The Explorer PLUS Toiletry Bag?Man that's a great question, thanks for asking. Toiletry bags - it’s probably something you don’t think about all the time but it’s something that you need every single time you travel. We’ve set out to design the best toiletry bag on the planet.This bag will carry it all while staying compact. Pack in an electric razor, electric toothbrush, loads of liquids, etc...easy peasy. See how we did it below!
Wait, how is it possible to fit all thatstuff?

How to back this campaign:1. Find the section ""Select a Perk"" or click on ""View Perks""2. Pick your perk level & checkout   Our StoryChris met Lance at a crowdfunding launch party in Utah, USA and Chris shared his idea for a new way to carry toiletries while traveling. The problem we saw was that many travelers were packing their toiletries into ziplock bags, giant “catch all” bags, and sometimes foregoing a toiletry bag all together. After many late nights researching & designing they launched “The Best Toiletry Bag For Traveling”  - making an organized, compact, & easier way to travel light.Goodness gracious...we raised over $200k in crowdfunding and Gravel has now shipped thousands of our bags to 65+ countries around the world. We’re blown away and humbled. Backers like you brought Gravel to life. This time around, with your help, we’re making our best products even better.We're here for our second Indiegogo campaign.

<h3>Our Tour Program</h3>
<p><strong>Tour 1: Cave visit</strong></p>
<p><i>Portimão, Carvoeiro, Praia da Marinha, Portimão​<strong>​</strong></i></p>
<p>In the morning, the sea is particularly quiet, ideal conditions for an unforgettable visit to the caves. Our journey begins in the historical river port of Rio Arade in Portimão. We follow the Rio Arade downstream past the fishing village of Ferragudo and two medieval castles to the Atlantic. From here we take course south-east, past the lighthouse of Ferragudo, the beach of Caneiros, the Roman tower and the smugglers cave. Along the Carvoeiro cliff with the rock formations of Algar Seco, the Praia Vale de Centianes to the Alfanzina lighthouse, along the beaches of Carvalho,  Benagil, Praia da Marinha and Armação de Pêra, there are the most and the largest and deepest caves of the Algarve.

The crew of the Pirate ship Santa Bernarda is doing sea excursion tours very successfully in the Algarve since 1992.First with the ‘Leaozinho’ excursion boat and since 2001 with the sailing ship 'Santa Bernarda' well known as the Pirate ship of the Algarve.
The Pirate ship Santa Bernarda
Then in 2015 after careful consideration we decided to take over the restaurant and excursion ship named “Rivolé”, which has not undertaken excursions since 2014.Our plan is to change the Rivolé into a  comfortable and safe passenger ship on the Algarve coast, with an total investment of 640,000.00€


The Rivolé 2015 when we bought her.
About the Rivolé
The home port of the passenger ship “RIVOLÉ” is Portimão.  All licenses for restaurant operation and driving licenses for the coastal region of the Algarve and the open sea are valid.Due to its particularly robust design for offshore excursions, the “Rivolé” is exceptionally safe for passenger shipping on the Algarve coast of Portugal.The “Rivolé” has two passenger decks that extend over the entire length of the vessel and provide space for a maximum of 220 passengers.On the main deck is the kitchen, the restaurant and barrier-free sanitary facilities.On the upper and sun deck is the navigation bridge, a bar as well as benches and tables for 120 people.
 
What We Need
The Rivolé is at present under Restoration, to bring the ship to the newest state of the art, safety, comfort, communication and update its environmental compatibility.

All ready invested capital, purchase of the ship and repairs:                           150.000,00 €

Crowdfunding goal to reach:                                                                                       140.000,00 €

EU support program, “Algarve 2020”, as loan:                                                     350.000,00 €

By December 2017 will have been invested.                                                          690.000,00 €


 
Our goals:


Barrier-free excursion boat.

Our Tour Program
Tour 1: Cave visit
Portimão, Carvoeiro, Praia da Marinha, Portimão​​
In the morning, the sea is particularly quiet, ideal conditions for an unforgettable visit to the caves. Our journey begins in the historical river port of Rio Arade in Portimão. We follow the Rio Arade downstream past the fishing village of Ferragudo and two medieval castles to the Atlantic. From here we take course south-east, past the lighthouse of Ferragudo, the beach of Caneiros, the Roman tower and the smugglers cave. Along the Carvoeiro cliff with the rock formations of Algar Seco, the Praia Vale de Centianes to the Alfanzina lighthouse, along the beaches of Carvalho,  Benagil, Praia da Marinha and Armação de Pêra, there are the most and the largest and deepest caves of the Algarve. With our cave boats, equipped with engines and life vests, you will explore at least 8 of these fascinating rock caves. Through narrow or wide entrances, you enter dark and colourful gleaming dome like vaults.​

<p>Ergens tussen 5 en 9 januari is de buitenboordmotor gejat van de Ragbak. En wel met brute kracht, want de achterkant van de boot is beschadigd, waardoor hij nu ook een nieuwe motor niet goed kan vasthouden.</p>

<li>Er moet reparatiewerk en nieuw laswerk aan de achterkant worden gevoerd, die zorgt dat een volgende motor er niet even gauw weer af kan worden geraust.<br/>Kosten: ± € 450.<br/> </li>

<h2> </h2>
<h2>Veelgestelde vragen</h2>
<p><br/><strong>1: Wat is er precies gebeurd?</strong><br/>Ze hebben de motor gejat! Ik keek naar buiten (waar de boot ligt) en kon op afstand al zien dat de motor er niet meer op zat. Ben een kijkje gaan nemen om de schade op te nemen.</p>
<p><strong>2: Wie?</strong><br/>Ze! Vervelende, nare mensen.</p>
<p><strong>3: Heb je aangifte gedaan?</strong><br/>Aangifte heb ik gedaan, maar de pliesie heeft geen tijd voor dit soort dingen. Een makker van me wiens boot om de hoek lag, zijn motor is ook gejat.</p>
<p><strong>4: Zat je motor niet goed vast dan?</strong><br/>Ik dacht van wel. Er zat een cilinderslot op die de schroefdraden die de motor vasthouden, afschermt om doorgezaagd te worden. Echter het is ze gelukt dat ding er gewoon af te trekken, vermoedelijk zonder die schroefdaden door te slijpen. Ook de staalkabel waarmee 'ie vastzat, is doorgeknipt. Gekste vind ik zelf trouwens, dat hij is gejat ookal zat de motorkap er niet op. Die heb ik nog thuis. Gewoonlijk kun je een motor zonder kap namelijk niet verkopen. Daarom zie je vaak Albert Heijn tassen over de motor zitten.</p>
<p><strong>5: Hoe ga je dit nu voorkomen dan?</strong><br/>Door de spiegel (het stukje achterkant van de boot waarop je een buitenboordmotor vastzet) te laten versterken met een stalen stang of wat de reparateur ook adviseert. Zodat gewoon sjorren niet lukt. Bovendien ga ik kijken of ik hem in de winter in de berging van de buren mag zetten.</p>
<p><strong>6: Waar baseer je die € 450 op?</strong><br/>Op een offerte aanvraag die ik heb gedaan bij de Oranjemarine. Ik wacht nog op andere offertes.</p>
<p><strong>7: Waar baseer je die € 1500 op?</strong><br/>Op Marktplaats onderzoek. Ik heb een motor op het oog die op het moment niet voor minder dan €1700 weggaat. Maar da's wel een erg goeie.</p>
<p><strong>8: Hoeveel ga je zelf inleggen?</strong><br/>Zoveel als nodig is. Dus zonodig de hele rataplan. Ik moet wel ook nog €384 dit jaar betalen aan gemeentelijk liggeld. Zucht.</p>
<p><strong>9: Kun je niet volstaan met iets goedkopers?</strong><br/>Sowieso moet het een viertakt worden. Want tweetakt mag vanaf dit jaar niet meer. Dit gaat ook de prijzen omhoog drijven op Marktplaats, want nu gaat iedereen er één nodig hebben. Ik zou voor een 5pk kunnen gaan ipv een 9.9pk, maar dan versta ik je goeie en slimme grappen niet als je bij me op de boot zit.</p>
<p><strong>10: Kun je niet net zo goed een andere boot kopen?</strong><br/>Dat valt helaas vies tegen. Boten met een beetje ruimte - vooral zo ruim als de Ragbak - daarvoor moet je behoorlijk in de buidel tasten. Vooral in Amsterdam (ik heb de Ragbak uit Weesp gehaald). Bovendien heeft de Ragbak andere voordelen. Namelijk dat dit de eerste onderhoudsklus in jaren is. Er hoeft in de regel nooit wat aan te gebeuren. Vandaar de naam. Ragbak.</p>
<p><strong>11: Wordt het niet eens tijd voor een elektrische motor? Met je babbels over geen auto rijden enzo?</strong><br/>Neen. Helaas zijn elektrische buitenboordmotoren, behalve onbetaalbaar, ook nog niet heel sterk. En doordat de accu's zoveel ruimte innemen, kun je met een behapbare accu ook niet heel ver komen. Die trip naar Pampus is dan bijvoorbeeld niet haalbaar. Met een beetje betaalbare elektrische kun je zelfs niet veilig het IJ op.</p>
<p><strong>12: Wat als de doelstelling van de fundraiser niet wordt behaald?</strong><br/>Dat maakt niet uit. Wat er binnenkomt, kan ik ophalen. Ik kijk op basis van wat er ge'pledge'd wordt, wat mijn mogelijkheden zijn.</p>
<p><strong>13A: Hoe kut is dit?</strong><br/>Best kut.</p>
<p><strong>13B: Vind je zelf het ook kut?</strong><br/>Ja. Maar er zijn ergere dingen. Het is een kwestie van euries.</p>

Pop up privacy panels help to block out those time-sucking visual and noise distractions when you are at your most creative: day or night.

Alcove's light bar is your dedicated, mobile task light that helps to reduce eye strain when reading or writing in low lighting environments. 



 
The traditional office as we know it today is disappearing. The desk is no longer where the majority of work is happening. 
Our smart devices, productivity apps, and cloud networks enable us to share content at any given moment. Wherever you work, you need to focus. Alcove is redefining the way you find that focus, so you can be more productive when inspiration strikes.
 
Your Dedicated Mobile Office Anywhere Life Takes You

 

 

Airplane mode provides the right amount of privacy when traveling
 
Alcove transforms your personal space into a private workstation, instantly. Our goal is to help people create their best work wherever life takes them. 
Alcove is the first product of its kind, offering you privacy that’s truly portable. Talent on the go need tools they can carry with them, so we’ve created a mobile workspace that also functions as a stylish and professional laptop case.

<p>Hi. I am a fourth grade student at Ray Lewis Elementary School. Two students who go to my school had a horrible fire this last week that destroyed the contents of their house. My campaign is about helping this family raise money for all their new stuff and everything else. You will help us pay for books, toys, applyances, and a handicap ramp for their house, because the oldest boy has special needs. As you can see in the photo, the fire started in their kitchen but it affected all of the rooms and everything in their house. If everybody piches in together we can achieve so much!</p>
<div>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>We are trying to raise at least 2000 dollars and delivering all proceeds to a family in need. My perks are the bronze level, the silver level and the gold levels.The bronze level is a level where if you donate $100 you will recive a $10 gift certificate for Chapters. The silver level is for if you donate $500 you will recive a $50 gift certificate for Montana's, Kelsey's Swiss Chalet and Harvey's resturant.The gold level is for if you (or your group) donate $1000 or more you will recive a $150 gift certificate for any WalMart location. Even if we don't reach our entire goal, all proceeds will go towards a family in need.</p>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>If you are generous enough to donate even a small amount you will not only be helping a family from my school who greatly needs it, but you will be building my faith in people. I think we can do this!! Let's make a difference! I know every little bit helps! If you are willing to donate to this family, not only will you be helping them, you will be helping the people of the comunity, you will be making Hamilton a better place, you will be raising awarness all across the world for other families that need your help, you will also feel very good about yourself if you do donate, and lastly you will be helping a fourth grade student trying to make a diffrence in this families life. And if you donate $100, $500, or $1000 my mom will personaly go to each store and without taking money from the fundraiser proceeds, she will buy each gift certifacet herself. She doesn't think I can get somebody to donate $1000. Let's prove her wrong! </p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>  I know some people just can't donate money, but that doesen't mean they can't help. If you are one of thoes people that just can't donate money it would realy help if you could tell everybody you know about this campaign. Maybe someone they tell can help. Another way you can help is donating stuft animals, toys or books. The Hamilton Mountain Police station is accepting donation of household goods and clothing. Once again, they have a 3 year old girl, a 8 year old girl and an 11 year old boy, so maybe girl sizes 4 and 8/10 and boy's size 14. I would realy apreaceat it. I hope most of you can contribute in some way.</p>

<p>Hi deep freediving addicts!</p>
<p>After the success of our noseclip in 2016 and our lanyard in 2017, this year we are happy to introduce <strong>the Octopus pulling system</strong>!</p>
<p>It took Pascal over 10 months of development work and dizains of virtual and 3D prototypes to finalize this new project! The last prototype was tested this September in the blue waters of Amorgos in Greece and gave full satisfaction!</p>
<p>In the end, we are presenting you with a product which is <strong>easy to use, sturdy (max. load 250kg), efficient, compact, ergonomic</strong> and at a <strong>very affordable price</strong> while maintaining <strong>high-quality components</strong> and finish!</p>
<p>It is so resistant that you can just leave it hanging under your buoy, no real need to rinse in fresh water. You can even jump on it with both feet, it will keep working over and over (<strong>with any rope from 8 to 12 mm diameter</strong>)!</p>
<p>Finally, <strong>in case of emergency</strong>, it will enable you to <strong>pull the line up way more efficiently</strong> than the traditional way (a.k.a. laying like a sack of potatoes on top of your buoy...).</p>
<p>It has an <strong>ergonomic shape</strong>: regarding both its <strong>ease of use with one hand</strong> (or even two fingers only!), and also the <strong>absence of sharp edges</strong> (how many times have you bumped your head in your buoy on the way up when you were a little bit “up there in the clouds”?).</p>
<p>Be the first to pre-order your new Octopus pulling system, <strong>at a great discounted price</strong>!!! Production will start in december, and delivery is planned for march 2019.</p>
<p><strong>Try it once and you will never go back</strong> to using just the simple carabiner!</p>

but also our routes go where the other big busses can’t! Join us, crank-up
the volume and sing along to those timeless tunes as we groove down the City

</p><h3><b>Our Vision</b></h3>
<p>This beautiful City by the Bay is ever changing, full of history, culture and new adventures. It is no wonder why Trip Advisor ranked San Francisco in the top 3 US
Cities to visit, with over 16.9 Million visitors in 2013. This is probably why
we are also saturated with those awkward big red London style busses full of
tourist, usually freezing, on that top opened deck… which frankly do not quite
fit the San Francisco vibe. Our hippie busses do!</p>
<p>Our vision is to be come an iconic San Francisco “moving
landmark."" We love taking people around the city, and we plan
to grow our company to up to 5 buses in year-one of operation. This growth will
bring in new jobs to the city of about 20 awesome tour guides and about 5 more
support staff. We are stoked to be able to contribute the City’s economic
growth and provide financial opportunity for our extended family. </p><div><br/></div><p>                  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/882658/files/20140925143610-FullSizeRender.jpg?1411680970"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>
</p><h3><b>Loves Back!</b></h3>
<p>We have an unwavering belief of sharing
our success with programs that enhance our community. We plan to meet our
desires to <b><i>Love Back</i></b> in three ways: financial contributions, donating our
services/products, and volunteering our time. We plan to contribute a fixed percentage
of our profits to go directly to non-for-profit programs. We also believe in
giving free tours to organizations that supports individuals and families in
need. Lastly, we will volunteer our time to organizations that enrich our
community.</p>
<br/><p>
</p><h3><b>Why an IndieGoGo Campaign?</b></h3><p>Two main reasons: for one, we are one of
the few local SF start-up companies, which is non-tech! With your support of
pre-purchasing our tours we can reach $10,000 to reach the next milestone in
making our dream come true: To operate as a City Sightseeing Tour company and
Charter Service. </p>
<p>To do so, we are required to obtain TCP
certificates from the Public Utility Commission (PUC), a business license from
the City of San Francisco, and permits from the San Francisco Police Department
(SFPD). Additionally, we need to purchase insurance premium that meets the City’s
requirements and one that has coverage for classic vehicles. Our estimate is a
little over $7,450 for permits and insurance. With the remaining $2,550 we will
make improvements to the interior of the Love Bus. </p>
<p>Second, this is an awesome way to let
people know of what is about to happen and give them the opportunity to participate
in the Start of a new company!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/834910/files/20140904174328-Screen_Shot_2014-09-04_at_5.42.33_PM.png?1409877808"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>

<p>One of the great advantages of rubber is its strength and durability. That’s why it is used in cars. At the same time, <strong>rubber can deform and go back to its original shape </strong>even after years of action, unlike many synthetic materials that eventually deform on regular usage. </p>

<p>Cork is a <strong>non deforming</strong>, <strong>natural cushioned</strong> material that always <strong>regains its form</strong> after many years of usage. At the same time it is<strong> temperature regulating</strong> and it keeps your feet cold in the summer and warm in the winter. That’s why some portuguese people use it in construction as insulation. With the extra foam layer, we guarantee the right mix between hardness and cushion, perfect for either hiking or casual cruising.  </p>

<p> </p></figure></div></div>","When we first started DopeKicks we had one vision in mind, to build the coolest, eco-friendly, super resistant and waterproof shoes and still make it accessible to everyone. We wanted to outperform all the other shoes in every category, and that is exactly what we have done.

 
 

Rubber is an ecological material that comes from the plant commonly known as “Para tree” that grows in South America, and southeast Asia. It is collected there and brought all over the world to make all kinds of tools. 

But we decided to go the extra mile and actually help clean what our competitors left behind. We have partnered up with experienced portuguese outsole manufacturers to create upcycled soles made from old shoes. They are flexible, durable and save the environment at the same time.  
 



The global shoe industry makes over 25 billion pairs a year and most of them end up in landfills, or worse, in our oceans. By supporting our project you are directly contributing to remove these dirty shoes from the environment and transform them into something good.
 
 

One of the great advantages of rubber is its strength and durability. That’s why it is used in cars. At the same time, rubber can deform and go back to its original shape even after years of action, unlike many synthetic materials that eventually deform on regular usage. 
 


When designing our soles we had to think of a wide range of applications. We balanced a rugged design for the heavy outdoor user, that would be light enough for the casual user. By strategically carving the outsoles we got a maximum grip level with reduced overall weight.   
 
 

Cork is a premium material available in nature. It comes from the cork-oak tree that has been growing for decades in Portugal. Approximately every 9 years, cork oaks grow a thick bark around them that is later collected to be processed. 

After collecting the bark from the tree, it is ground and made into flat sheets. The next process is to cut it into molds and add foam for extra cushion. The process takes a few days. 
 


Cork is a non deforming, natural cushioned material that always regains its form after many years of usage. At the same time it is temperature regulating and it keeps your feet cold in the summer and warm in the winter. That’s why some portuguese people use it in construction as insulation. With the extra foam layer, we guarantee the right mix between hardness and cushion, perfect for either hiking or casual cruising.  
 


One of the great uses of cork is to make floors. Why? Because of the anti-microbial properties in cork which  can naturally repel small vermin and insects with a waxy substance called suberin (conveniently named after the cork oak tree). This wax allows it to have water-resistant attributes and helps promote healthy feet.
 
 

We wanted to make something for the active person, the challenger, the explorer, something that could provide the best experience under any conditions, and that’s why we built it waterproof.

At DopeKicks we spent months looking for the right supplier of Hemp to guarantee a premium fabric that was not only strong, flexible, and durable but also waterproof and dustproof.
 


Our hemp has been made to repel all water from coming in. During the manufacturing process we added a special coating layer that would protect the fabric and its properties from stains, liquids and dust particles. This will make the fabric very easy to clean as well. 
 


To guarantee that no water would come in we also added a special waterproof membrane, providing a total 2 layers of protection and keeping your feet dry no matter what.  100% protection against wind, cold, liquids and dust.
 
 


We chose Portugal for several reasons. The local shoe industry is huge and it has been supplying top world brands with nothing but the best quality, and we know we are delivering real value to people, not only our customers but also to the employees, the ones working hard to build DopeKicks.

If we don’t get people a fair salary, how can we expect them to opt-in for a more sustainable pair of sneakers? Ford once said that about his cars, and now we ask ourselves the same thing with our shoes.

 
By choosing fair trade production we are empowering people so that they too can choose environmentally friendly sneakers when they go to the store. Because only together, we can change things for the better. 

 
 

DopeKicks is designed for the outdoors, for the urban explorers and everything in between. 

Either if you are traveling in the tropics, running in the mountain or just chilling by the beach, DopeKicks will be there, because good sneakers take you to good places.

 
 

When we designed our kicks we made them in such a way to repel not only liquids but stains as well. Our special coating material makes sure that dirt doesn’t stick. 
No more napkins or waiting for your shoes to dry. Just rinse the dirt off your shoes with some water and you're good to go!

 

 

 
 We have sad news everyone, our shoe is not for smoking. Hemp is actually the “sober cousin” of marijuana. It has a minimal amount of psychoactive components, and for that reason it is legal everywhere in the world. Our team has traveled across Europe, China and the US with it, and all you get is a bunch of excited security officers wanting to take a picture of them.
 Did you know hemp is so strong Henry Ford once built a car with it. It was 10x stronger than steel, and Henry Ford was so confident on the strength of the panel that he took an axe to hit the car. The axe, that would have cut through any steel panel simply bounced back. 
It took us 4 months of samples and travel to find the right suppliers. We had to ensure that our material had the best strength while remaining flexible and durable.  
 Hemp is a material with a lot of potential. Besides being super strong, it is also very environmentally friendly. It consumes 3 times less water than cotton, and it has a minimal impact on the soil. By backing our project you are directly supporting hemp farmers from around the world.   Finding the right materials, the right soles and the right footbeds was just a small part of the process. In order to make something that people would use, we had to make something cool, something that we could be proud of. It took us several trials to actually reach a satisfactory result. And then it took us 2 prototypes to reach what we have now. 1 year later, we are proud of the final result.

<p>As the Lojel US distributor, we always want to bring the best luggage options to the US market. However, the challenge we have been facing is coming up with the most accurate forecast for specific products. In the past, we have tried introducing products to the US market, however many didn’t take off as projected. In order to convince the Lojel headquarters that the U.S. market is ready for the Ultra-Lite luggage, we decided to go on Indiegogo to ask for your help.</p>
<p>Lojel HQ has already produced a small quantity of samples, but we are still having trouble getting HQ on board with our ideas. We believe the Ultra-Lite Luggage is perfect for our US customers. That’s why we need a solid number of backers to prove that we are able to bring this amazing product into the U.S. At the same time, by using crowd funding, we are able to lower the cost to our customers.</p>
<p>We need your support to make this happen! We would like to pass the savings on to our backers on Indiegogo, the customers who are willing to help Lojel build a better name in the US market.</p>

</div></div>","In order to accommodate the restrictions placed on carry-on luggage from various airlines, LOJEL has come up with an innovative luggage system that is extremely lightweight and has a large capacity. With carefully constructed details and a stylish design, we aim to provide the best carry-on luggage to all travelers worldwide.ULTRA LIGHT WEIGHT:•	Lightest Weight: 1.8kg / 3.9lb •	Magnesium pull Trolley •	Nylon trimming Zipper: Instead of plastic trimming, this zipper significantly reduces the weight by 200 grams and provides a finer aspect design-wise•	Monolithic & Integrated wheel design: Wheels are embed into the luggage shell, which makes it light weight but not forgo the durability.FASHIONABLE DESIGN:


• Contoured Profile
The whole shape of this luggage larger at the bottom and more narrow and rounded at the top. The purpose of this shape is to better resist impacts.

•	Rounded corners

Unlike most luggages which have sharp corners, the shape of this collection is flexible enough to absorb impact and avoid cracks in the shell.


•	Thinner & Waved shell surface
The waves on the shell surface keep the material dense enough in the areas more exposed to impact (the 4 top corners) while also reducing the weight of the luggage.


•	Color matching in details (trimming, hinge & name tag)•	100% genuine leather hinge & name tag




MAGNESIUM PULL TROLLEY:



•	Special Material: LOJEL's ULTRA-LITE luggage trolley is made out of Magnesium instead of the traditional Aluminium luggage trolley. • The trolley is 30% lighter and 30% stronger than traditional Aluminum luggage trolleys.
STRONG CORE STRUCTURE FOR BETTER BALANCE: 


•	Curved cut on top of the luggage - Keeps the handle close to the center to keep the luggage balanced when lifted. •	Ultra Soft Foam Handle: The Ethylene Vinyl Acetate material provides a super soft texture which makes the handle more comfortable.SUPER STRONG DUAL COIL ZIPPER:


In most luggages a single coil zipper is used. LOJEL's ULTRA-LITE luggage features a dual coil zipper. This zipper provides better security and is more durable than a single coil zipper.
ADVANCE PC MATERIAL: The 3-layer Polycarbonates material used in the ULTRA-LITE luggage is an exclusively made strong material. This material is light weight while still remaining highly resistant to impact.ACCESSORIES FOR BETTER ORGANIZATION:
