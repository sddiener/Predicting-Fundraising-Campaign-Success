<p>        Attending a cat show!     Our Holiday Card with 3/4 of our cats. </p>
<p>Thanks for visiting our Indiegogo page. If you are here, you are probably like us in that nothing sounds better than drinking coffee in a room full of cats. We love cats more than almost anything, and share our home with four of them. We want to bring the joy we experience in our home to everyone, while helping homeless kitties find loving forever homes.</p>
<p>Purr Cup Cafe will be the perfect place for people looking for a new feline friend, those who cannot currently own cats, or those that have plenty of cats of their own, but want to meet and help more awesome kitties! For less than the price of seeing a movie, you can spend an hour in our cozy cat lounge. You can also stop by for a coffee and quick kitty pick-me-up anytime!</p>
<p>Purr Cup Cafe will have something for everyone; Caturday morning cartoons, cats on mats yoga class, student specials for study time,  coloring with cats, birthday parties, and much more!</p>
<p>Bringing this unique business to Raleigh is a big project. There is lots of planning and fundraising to be done, but we are passionate and hard working people who will do anything to make this happen. The cats--and you, the cat lovers of Raleigh, deserve it!</p>
<p>Here is the current timeline we are working with:</p>
<p>          <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496248103/raceuowjshmcb1unn00j.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get:</h3>
<p>Your contribution will help us take the first steps towards getting our doors open. With this money, we can begin searching for the purrrrfect location, secure a lease, and transform our space into an awesome spot for our cats and our customers.</p>
<p>Our fundraising goal of $28,800  is  just a portion of our projected startup costs. The rest of the funding will be done through bank loans, credit cards, and personal savings.</p>
<p>Here is a basic outline of where our indiegogo funding will go:</p>
<ul>
<li>Indiegogo Perks for our Supporters: $1000</li>
<li>Securing a Lease for our Purrfect Location: $7000</li>
<li>Buildout for Cafe and Cat Lounge: $20,000</li>
<li>POS system: $800</li>
</ul>
<p>Other expenses will include deposits for insurance and utilities, cafe equipment, inventory, and cat supplies. </p>
<p>We are 100% committed to making this happen, and we are prepared to seek other funding options should we fall short of our Indiegogo goal, but your contributions will be invaluable in alleviating some of the financial burden of startup costs. With your help, we can stay on track to open our doors in Spring 2018 and start saving kitties!</p>
<p>To express our gratitude, we have some pretty cool perks for our supporters. We hope you think they are as exciting as we do! </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges:</h3>
<p>Starting a business is always risky, but we are prepared to rise to the challenge!</p>
<p>Our main challenges will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Funding: The startup cost involved in making Purr Cup Cafe as awesome as we want it to be for our cats and our customers is no small amount, but this Indiegogo campaign will be beyond helpful. We are ready to explore all of our options and to pursue whatever sources of funding prove most beneficial to us.</li>
<li>Finding the right lenders and landlord: While our fellow cat lovers may be familiar with the cat cafe concept, many people have not heard of this idea, despite the fact that it is sweeping the nation. It may be hard to sell the concept to lenders and the owners of commercial spaces. However, we have received great support so far, and can only assume this type of support will continue. Having lived and worked downtown for many years, we are fortunate to be very well connected to the Raleigh community. Raleigh is a creative and growing city that is committed to fostering local business and we are confident we will find the right people to help us secure loans and the purrfect space.</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Imagine a coffee house where ""Cheers"" meets ""Friends""; a place where everybody knows your name and cares about YOUR story. That's the kind of coffee house that we want to open in the Richland area. We started with a dream, that dream became a goal, our goal is to start offering our specialty coffees and teas as well as fresh roasted coffee beans within the next 6 MONTHS! This is the next step to achieve that goal.</p>
<p>As an educator with Gull Lake Community Schools for over 24 years, Floy has developed strong connections with the families and businesses of the Gull Lake community.  Having grown up in the Richland area, Kim has a knowledge and pride in her community that is unsurpassed. Together they have built this dream of making Great Grounds Coffee another prestigious Richland business.  At Great Grounds we want to foster community connections and inspire kindness.  Great Grounds Coffee house  is a coffee house designed to bring a community together.</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The problem right now, is when the fine people of Richland want a high quality coffee or tea, they have to travel outside of our town.  THE SOLUTION?! We will be brewing, steeping and roasting RIGHT HERE IN RICHLAND!</p>
<p>Please consider making a donation to help us open the doors of Great Grounds Coffee House</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal for this campaign is to raise $50,000! This will go toward purchasing equipment and renovating our future store front . Any money beyond our $50,000 will continue to go toward expanding our community outreach, barista education and equipment maintenance. </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our biggest obstacle at this point in time is funding. We have spend time putting together our business plan, refining it with the help of the Small Business Development Center, educating ourselves in the art of barista and applying for small business loans.  After being unable to secure enough funding due to the start up nature of our business we refocused our efforts into this crowdfunding campaign. </p>
<p>We believe in our business model, our thirst to be life long learners and the natural social environment of a coffee house will lead to our businesses success. </p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1175533/files/20150126140418-rooftop.png?1422309858"" src="""" style=""width: 555px; height: 370px;""/></p>

<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight: normal; background-color: initial;"">THE SCIENCE</span><br/>
</h2>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Touted as a technological breakthrough, at the heart of the Typhoon is a ducted fan ""hybrid"" that exhibits the properties of a gyroscope where the ducted fan is magnetized, making it function as a rotor as well.  The central fan not only stabilizes the vehicle, making for easy and safe flight control, but also creates enough lift, with more than 1000 HP on tap, to take off and land vertically. </p>
<p>Electromagnets located within the body of the vehicle create the oscillating magnetic fields used to interact with neodymium magnets located within the rotor itself.  These are the same proven principles used in inrunner electric motors that power everything from computer hard drives to the Tesla sports car. </p>
<div>There are four corner fans that are rotatable in three dimensions and operate in a manner similar to a quadcopter drone, allowing for directional change in flight path. <p></p>
</div>
<div>Energy will be supplied by lithium-ion batteries, and eventually fuel cells, as the technology becomes more readily available.</div>
</div>

<h4> <span style=""font-weight: normal; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 30px; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 38px; background-color: initial;"">PRACTICAL</span>
</h4>
<div>
<p>Small enough to fit in your garage, the Typhoon will open a whole new world of freedom to its owner. Easily scalable-- While the Typhoon f1 is designed for a single occupant, a larger Typhoon f4, or four occupant model, would only require a one foot  increase in the radius of the main fan. </p>
</div>

</div>
<h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Unlike other offerings that require large fields or airports for take off and landing, the Typhoon can take off from your driveway.</span></h4>
<h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The controls of the vehicle are similar to a modern car.  With a tug on the right steering wheel paddle, you will rise off the ground in an almost silent surge that gives you butterflies.  Push the gas pedal to go forward; push the brake pedal to stop; steer left to go left and right to go right. When you arrive at your destination, pull on the left paddle and you will descend to a smooth, computer-assisted landing. </span></h4>

</div>
<div>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The Typhoon is computer-controlled
using a fly-by-wire system that allows for multiple flight settings: From an
autonomous “Drone” mode that essentially flies itself, to a “Sport” setting
that will allow for driver-inspired, multiple g-force banking turns, and
everything in between.  Simply choose
your preferred setting from a switch located on the steering wheel.  If you feel like you are losing control, just
let go of the steering wheel and the vehicle will return to a stable
hover.  Additionally, the computer will
take over to ensure the safety of the occupants (i.e. proximity sensor is
tripped, low batteries, unsafe maneuvers, etc…).  As a last-ditch safety measure, a
rocket-launched parachute will automatically deploy. </span><br/>
</div>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">MANUFACTURING</span></h2>
<h4>
<span style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial; font-weight: normal;"">Structurally similar to a Formula One race car, the Typhoon will be constructed almost entirely of carbon fiber.  </span>
</h4>
<h4><span style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial; font-weight: normal;"">With recent advancements in the composition of specialized filaments used in 3D printing, we will now be able to employ this technology in the fabrication of the non-structural components of the vehicle. Additionally, we will use 3D printing to make molds that will be used to lay up the carbon fiber parts for the final production model.</span></h4>

</div><div><br/></div></div>","MEET THE TYPHOON f1 

With the Typhoon, living out your childhood dreams of flying will only be as far away as your garage.  Help us make the freedom of flying accessible to everyone. 




THE SCIENCE



Touted as a technological breakthrough, at the heart of the Typhoon is a ducted fan ""hybrid"" that exhibits the properties of a gyroscope where the ducted fan is magnetized, making it function as a rotor as well.  The central fan not only stabilizes the vehicle, making for easy and safe flight control, but also creates enough lift, with more than 1000 HP on tap, to take off and land vertically. 
Electromagnets located within the body of the vehicle create the oscillating magnetic fields used to interact with neodymium magnets located within the rotor itself.  These are the same proven principles used in inrunner electric motors that power everything from computer hard drives to the Tesla sports car. 
There are four corner fans that are rotatable in three dimensions and operate in a manner similar to a quadcopter drone, allowing for directional change in flight path. 

Energy will be supplied by lithium-ion batteries, and eventually fuel cells, as the technology becomes more readily available.





 PRACTICAL


Small enough to fit in your garage, the Typhoon will open a whole new world of freedom to its owner. Easily scalable-- While the Typhoon f1 is designed for a single occupant, a larger Typhoon f4, or four occupant model, would only require a one foot  increase in the radius of the main fan. 


LIFTOFF 

Unlike other offerings that require large fields or airports for take off and landing, the Typhoon can take off from your driveway.
The controls of the vehicle are similar to a modern car.  With a tug on the right steering wheel paddle, you will rise off the ground in an almost silent surge that gives you butterflies.  Push the gas pedal to go forward; push the brake pedal to stop; steer left to go left and right to go right. When you arrive at your destination, pull on the left paddle and you will descend to a smooth, computer-assisted landing. 

FLYING ROBOT 


The Typhoon is computer-controlled
using a fly-by-wire system that allows for multiple flight settings: From an
autonomous “Drone” mode that essentially flies itself, to a “Sport” setting
that will allow for driver-inspired, multiple g-force banking turns, and
everything in between.  Simply choose
your preferred setting from a switch located on the steering wheel.  If you feel like you are losing control, just
let go of the steering wheel and the vehicle will return to a stable
hover.  Additionally, the computer will
take over to ensure the safety of the occupants (i.e. proximity sensor is
tripped, low batteries, unsafe maneuvers, etc…).  As a last-ditch safety measure, a
rocket-launched parachute will automatically deploy. 

MANUFACTURING

Structurally similar to a Formula One race car, the Typhoon will be constructed almost entirely of carbon fiber.  

With recent advancements in the composition of specialized filaments used in 3D printing, we will now be able to employ this technology in the fabrication of the non-structural components of the vehicle. Additionally, we will use 3D printing to make molds that will be used to lay up the carbon fiber parts for the final production model.

I have been collaborating with electrical and mechanical engineers across the globe who specialize in innovative technologies, and also material engineers from MACD Engineering and Carbon Composites.









WHOM AM I?



  
I learned at an early age that if you mixed iodide crystals and ammonia, you could make a solution that, when stepped on, would go POP! My journey into Science began... While other kids in my 5th grade class were making baking soda volcanoes,  I brought in a Jacob's Ladder.  By the end of the school year, I constructed a Tesla Coil using the Jacob's Ladder and then rebuilt an old Van de Graaff generator of my teacher's so that I could impress the girls by making their hair stand up!Soon after,  I started developing rocket fuel; singeing a few eyebrows along the way. One summer, my brother and I helped my father build an Atom Smasher in the basement.  I still remember how much those lead aprons weighed.As the years passed, I became an avid RC modeler, where I gained the experience of working with electric motors, customizing and building my own to suit various experiments.  I guess you could say I have been an ""Extreme Hobbyist"" as early as I can remember. My college experience included studies in Aerospace Engineering with degrees in Finance and Economics.As a published author, film producer and  designer, I have had the privilege of sharing a cup of coffee with many brilliant minds including Physicists, Astronauts Engineers and Futurists.  It is this compendium of knowledge that has guided me on a path to the doorstep of the ""Typhoon"".

Now, in early 2015, after decades of study and experimentation, it is time to realize this dream.
THE CAMPAIGN
The purpose of this campaign is to build a  Full scale prototype of the Typhoon   for testing.
The prototype will be manufactured almost entirely with large format 3D printers using special carbon laced filaments, allowing us to start flight testing within the year.  
Most of the sub-systems, computer hardware, servo controls etc.. will be directly transferable between the prototype and the final production model.  
The Typhoon  will represent a leap forward in our conquering of skies and the freedoms that will come along with it.  You can be a big part of that leap.
  
Risks & Challenges
 Technologically, the Typhoon  is an extremely complex machine, but it's that same  technology that helps to simplify the actual manufacturing of the vehicle.  The scientific principles that I am using are time tested and well proven; I am simply applying the technology in a different way to make it useful for the Typhoon.
Of course there can be manufacturing delays and complications that could possibly necessitate some changes to the basic design, but none of these complications would be insurmountable.

<h1 style=""color: #21b4b5;""><span style=""color: #21b4b5; background-color: initial;"">Backstory:</span></h1>
<p>As a Navy Corpsman, my job was to keep my Marines alive and healthy in combat. That starts with
hygiene.  If you can’t get clean then you become a risk to the group
and community around you. This is as true at war overseas as it is on the streets here at home.</p>
<p>During patrols in Afghanistan, we were often weeks at a time without a shower. Not only does poor hygiene impact your physical health, but it impacts your mental health as well. </p>
<blockquote><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-family: serif;"">You overlook the dignity that the simple act
of washing your hands or taking a shower brings. </span></blockquote>
<p>Upon returning to the U.S., I moved to downtown Los Angeles near Skid Row, the epicenter of the Los Angeles homeless population. I was infuriated by the lack of access to basic hygiene among the city's homeless, especially marginalized PTSD-affected veterans.  How could it be that a war veteran lives dirtier at home than at war?</p>
<p>Turns out we get exactly the world we build.  So I got to work.   
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I COMMITTED TO CREATING A BUSINESS USING ONLY HONORABLE, SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE,  COMMON-SENSE PRACTICES.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>I realized that soap and water could be powerful tools to fix some of the very real, yet completely unnecessary misery in my own back yard.  I decided to make a soapbox from which to speak about real solutions. And so, Maxwell's Soaps was born.

</div></div>","I’m Maxwell Moore, a combat veteran and social entrepeneur trying to make a difference. 






Maxwell Moore (right) treating a wound.


Backstory:
As a Navy Corpsman, my job was to keep my Marines alive and healthy in combat. That starts with
hygiene.  If you can’t get clean then you become a risk to the group
and community around you. This is as true at war overseas as it is on the streets here at home.
During patrols in Afghanistan, we were often weeks at a time without a shower. Not only does poor hygiene impact your physical health, but it impacts your mental health as well. 
You overlook the dignity that the simple act
of washing your hands or taking a shower brings. 
Upon returning to the U.S., I moved to downtown Los Angeles near Skid Row, the epicenter of the Los Angeles homeless population. I was infuriated by the lack of access to basic hygiene among the city's homeless, especially marginalized PTSD-affected veterans.  How could it be that a war veteran lives dirtier at home than at war?
Turns out we get exactly the world we build.  So I got to work.   



I COMMITTED TO CREATING A BUSINESS USING ONLY HONORABLE, SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE,  COMMON-SENSE PRACTICES.

I realized that soap and water could be powerful tools to fix some of the very real, yet completely unnecessary misery in my own back yard.  I decided to make a soapbox from which to speak about real solutions. And so, Maxwell's Soaps was born.




Goal:
For this campaign, I'm proud to be a supporting partner of Lava Mae—an innovative San Francisco non-profit turning old city buses into mobile shower units. These people are literally making the world a cleaner place. They're the folks we are fighting for on this mission. The $15,000 will be used to produce the 5,000 bars of soap needed to supply six months of showers for the homeless. Each person who takes a shower on a Lava Mae bus will get their own bar of Maxwell’s Soap.







Large retail bath bar (L) and donated travel bar.
Stretch Goal:


If we can meet the needs of the Lava Mae buses, we will upgrade our current process to include a more streamlined production facility as well as update our current packaging to a more sustainable, biodegradable solution for our soap.  





Combining a premium formula for soap with the cause we are serving is unlike anything on the market. I've perfected my flagship product: a premium goats milk glycerin soap blended with organic coconut. This creates a detergent-free soap base that naturally hydrates and softly exfoliates. My soaps are scented with essential and fragrant oils to give an incredibly refreshing scent.  
I just make better soap than you're using. 
Big deal.  
It's really not that hard to make something great in a market of garbage.
The best thing about using this soap, is knowing that someone less fortunate has access to a shower because of your support. Somebody dirty got clean.
Look at that. We just solved a problem, and you got great soap.  
Pretty ninja, right?








All Natural Ingredients:  Our glycerine is certified kosher and made only from vegetable sources. We use purified water, goats milk, aloe vera gel, and honey to smooth and hydrate your skin. We use organic, food-grade raw coconut shavings to exfoliate old skin cells and scrub dirt and grime away.


No Detergents or Dyes: We keep our ingredients list elegantly short.  Our soap formulary is one you can trust. ""If it doesn't make sense, it doesn't make soap!""


Made in AMERICA, No overseas outsourced labor: Our soap is made in America and paying American bills.  We are a 100% veteran-owned and operated company. We don't use sweatshops and we will never outsource our labor overseas.


Locally Sourced: We source from local suppliers in California to lower our overall carbon footprint while stimulating local economies.

     of Rootflage, a revolutionary temporary quick-fix Root Touch Up powder designed to save you time and
     money between salon visits. Rootflage temporarily yet effectively camouflages dark or gray root regrowth in seconds without damaging your hair. I built
     this brand from the ground up specifically for blondes who want to cover dark or gray root regrowth, 
but now I want to expand my line to brunettes
     and beyond! If
     you contribute you will help me raise money to pay for my new packaging
     for these new colors...(Dark Brown/Black applied to the left)
(Copper Penny Red applied to the left)

What We Need & What You Get
I
     need $15,000 to help pay for my new packaging so I can bring you our wider line of new
     colors that are ready for the world. By supporting this campaign, you can buy Rootflage at a discount, have custom colors made or have a color named after you! If I
     don’t reach my goal the money I raise will still go towards my new packaging. I promise I won't spend it on having a pity party for myself. 


The Impact
I originally created Rootflage for myself and for a few of my blonde friends. There was nothing on the market that worked for blondes to cover dark or gray roots until I developed it!  I realized that this was a real need for blonde women who wanted to save time and money.  I wanted to help working moms, stay at home moms, career women, college students, world travelers, clients who can't get in to see their colorist and basically anyone concerned about their roots and interested in saving time and money.  The brand has grown over 500% in the last year because of word of mouth and because the product works! I decided it was time to stop leaving out all my brunette friends and future customers and that it was time to expand my color line.
  

Risks & Challenges
I started this company almost 3 years ago and have experienced sweet successes as well as setbacks. I have learned from every mistake and always listen closely to my customers who help me to grow and understand their needs in hair color and covering their root re-growth.

<p>Hello and thank you for contacting <b>POWERPOiNT INTERNATIONAL CHURCH BUILDING FUNDING PROJECT</b>.</p>
<p>ARISE AND LET US BUILD FOR GOD ...</p>
<p>The
Words of the Master in the Scriptures say ""<i>Go ye therefore, and teach all nations.</i>"" This is our
commission and we are committed to reaching the world with the message of hope
and life in Christ Jesus, preaching, teaching &amp; healing.</p>
<p>We are
Kingdom Builders, Building Kingdom People for Kingdom Living. We are committed
to helping people live a life full of Power, driven by God-given Purpose and
the Pursuit of Excellence. PowerPoint International has been around for some
time affecting lives all around the world from our base in Mableton, an Atlanta
suburb, Georgia, USA. We want to expand our reach so as to be able to reach
even more people from North America and Canada to Europe, Asia and Africa and
to the ends of the earth with the Gospel of Hope and Life. </p>
<p>We
invite you to join us in this great commission and support this project campaign
with your time, treasure, and talent. The purpose of this campaign is to raise
funds for the building of a befitting house of glory for God’s work. We are
looking at building a ministry operational base that will house the type of
modern infrastructures that will enhance our services and enable us to carry
out this God-given commission with more zeal and in a more organized and
focused approach.</p>
<p>The
building will have a family worship center that will directly minister to and
cater for our immediate community; this will also include a youth center that
will take care of the children and our upcoming adults, bringing them up in the
way of the Lord so that they can become responsible adults in time.</p>
<p>At
PowerPoint, we offer prayer support to all. Prayer is key to fulfilling the
commission we have been given, hence the need to establish a 24/7 Prayer Power
House (also called the Prayer Tower) where prayers will constantly and
consistently be offered for people from all around the world. Prayer is power
and there are many nations, organizations and people all around the world that
are in urgent need of prayer support which we offer at PowerPoint International.
People will be able to connect physically by receiving prayers at the physical
location through one-on-one prayers, congregational prayers, prayer conferences,
healing and deliverance prayers. They can also connect virtually through telephone
prayers, radio broadcasts, television broadcasts, Internet broadcasts, social
networking and so on.</p>

<p>A
full-fledged media office/production studio will also be cited in this building
where life-changing and life-impacting broadcasts will be transmitted to the
world 24/7 through various platforms especially the Internet broadcast (Radio/TV)
platforms thereby making it accessible and affordable to all, anytime and
anywhere. The building will also service others arms of the ministry such
as M<span>issions and World Outreach, Conferences and
Meetings, Community Support Services, Food Pantry, Cloth Drives, Toy Drives for
Children, etc.</span></p>
<p>Already,
many are being blessed and positively impacted by our current, though very
limited, services and facilities.  Lives are being affected and changed
positively, the sick and the afflicted are healed, the troubled and tormented
are delivered, many more are coming to the saving knowledge of God and being
set free from ignorance and bondage and are living a new life in God. People
are being taught the undiluted Word of God thereby opening their eyes to the
truth that the scriptures hold for them. They are getting to know the truth and
the truth is not only setting them free but also making them free. The jobless
are getting employed. The barren are having children. Employees are starting
businesses, becoming self-employed and employing others. The haunted,
oppressed, depressed, afflicted, addicted, tormented, and bound are being set
free and living a life of freedom and liberty.</p>
<p>We will
like to share with you just a few of the recorded miracles brought about by the
impact of the work the Lord is doing through this ministry in the lives of the
few that we have been able to reach with our services.</p>

about 5 years with no children. I was told by my medical specialists that I

being taught the Word of God, learning how to pray and do spiritual warfare.

first child, a boy. Just about 2 years later I

ministry. Then suddenly the settlement case with my former employer which had
already been closed was reopened miraculously (I had already given up on it)
and everything, I mean everything that I was entitled to was fully restored
back unto me. I was delivered from the shelter. I started a business and God

deliverance. What the Lord did in my life was permanent and since then I have
never had any crises again. Thank God for the prayer support I got from the prayer warriors at
the PowerPoint International Church. Since I and my

<br/></div>","Say Hello to The Art of Yoga! 
We are a yoga studio located in in
a renovated loft warehouse in the heart of downtown Columbus. 

At the Art of Yoga, students discover
themselves and the beauty of art, with work displayed by a different Central
Ohio artist each month.
What We Need & What You Get:
We've worked hard to create a
beautiful, unique space that is the perfect place for you to take a break
from your everyday life. But we could use some help finishing our
space! The moment we saw this space, we were immediately struck by the
amount of potential it held. It has been a long (and expensive) journey to get
to this point and now we're eager to put the finishing touches on the studio.
By contributing to this campaign, you
will help us:
• 
Expand the matted area, doubling the
space dedicated to yoga.
• 
Finish the changing room. Here's what
we need to do this: paint the room, install laminate flooring, hang coat hooks,
mirror and a place a chinese screen in the corner to cover the heating pipe. By
an ottoman or two for seating. Install new lighting. 
• 
A vinyl baseboard throughout the
studio. 
• 
Additional shoe cubbies and more
entry way seating (desperately needed!)
• 
Upgrade the shower. Yes, we have a
shower, but currently no one uses it. While it's functional, it certainly needs
a more appealing upgrade.

fact that although 90 percent of people will marry in their lifetimes, only
three in 10 will find enduring love, Tashiro says. (He gets this statistic by adding
unhappy marriages and separations to the 50 percent divorce rate).– This fact prompted us to dig deeper

<p>Our company is passionate with creating an unmatched
service that’s
for Christians and Africans alike. Unfortunately we have noticed when companies
design new concepts they contain preliminary flaws but our goal is to stay
dedicated to quality because we know your love is at stake! We have engineered
a unique method and user-friendly results that is second to none. Not only
that, but they are more affordable so do not have to worry about it being price
prohibitive. Help us make this a reality and let’s find love for less!  I am an African (Kenyan) professional (35yrs
old) working in Australia and I’ve seen this kind of website work really well
here in Australia with similar sites and that is why I believe it can work in
Africa. I am also from a solid Christian background and believe in good
Christian values.  The Internet use in
Africa is growing at a very fast rate and this idea would be able to grow and
develop with this rise of Internet use. 
So not only is Africa ready for this change they are yearning for it and
I am honored to be able to bring this solution to people.</p>
<p><b>How You Can Help</b></p>
<p>For us to bring the “Afro Kristian” to

possible solutions.</p>
<p>We will also be using the funding to

feel this will be the key to our customer AND staff retention.
About Us
Our company is passionate with creating an unmatched
service that’s
for Christians and Africans alike. Unfortunately we have noticed when companies
design new concepts they contain preliminary flaws but our goal is to stay
dedicated to quality because we know your love is at stake! We have engineered
a unique method and user-friendly results that is second to none. Not only
that, but they are more affordable so do not have to worry about it being price
prohibitive. Help us make this a reality and let’s find love for less!  I am an African (Kenyan) professional (35yrs
old) working in Australia and I’ve seen this kind of website work really well
here in Australia with similar sites and that is why I believe it can work in
Africa. I am also from a solid Christian background and believe in good
Christian values.  The Internet use in
Africa is growing at a very fast rate and this idea would be able to grow and
develop with this rise of Internet use. 
So not only is Africa ready for this change they are yearning for it and
I am honored to be able to bring this solution to people.
How You Can Help
For us to bring the “Afro Kristian” to
life, we need your support!
Your generous funding will help us get
things started in order to realize our concept. It will assist us with the cost
of further development, manufacturing and production.  We will also use our funding to test our
concept to make it better.  We are
committed to continuous improvement so we are always giving people the best
possible solutions.
We will also be using the funding to
expand the possibilities for the usage for consumers as well as enterprise
solutions of the “Afro Kristian”, to further customize the first version of the
“Afro Kristian” and create additional products and services that will
compliment “Afro Kristian”.
The “Afro Kristian” needs pledging but
above all it needs your attention and interest! If you love this product as
much as we do then please take a moment to click on one of our social media
buttons (Facebook, Twitter and YouTube at the bottom of the page). Help us spread
the word and get things started!
How We'll Use the Funds
We need about 30,000 USD  in
order to break “Afro Kristian” onto the market. That will includes marketing,
materials, labor and related expenses for start-up. 
Final Thank You and Links
We feel so grateful to everyone who has
taken the time to read out campaign and for those who contributed what they
could to make a difference and helping us spread the word.  We have spent the last few months working
hard to bring our vision to life in this campaign and it was worth every minute
thanks to all our generous supporters.

<p>Hi, I’m Ken Crawford. I want to take this opportunity to share some of my
story and to invite you along on this journey. I am establishing a US based
organization to support leaders of community nonprofits, both faith-based and
secular. And I need your help. </p>
<p>The Institute for Vital Ministry will be a platform to provide leadership
and life coaching, spiritual direction and pastoral counseling to clergy and
lay leaders of churches and community based nonprofits. We will also be a
center for researching best practices for the changing landscapes of ministry -
what I like to call the New Pastoral Economy. </p>

<p><b><i><u>What is IVM?</u></i></b></p>
<p>Institute for Vital Ministry (IVM) will become a community of diverse
individuals, groups, and stake holders who collaborate as they develop vital
faith and ministry.  The purpose is to create, collect and share resources
to develop, support and renew vital ministry. This work is accomplished through
a combination of peer learning communities, training events, immersion
experiences, consulting, and individual coaching, counseling and spiritual
direction.  By design the program will seek to address and integrate the
full range of needs of participants in a holistic model. I've been doing this
work for over 15 years, and I want to make these tools available to anyone who
wants them. Visit the gallery to see video testimonials from some of my clients

<p>Changes in church and culture place increasing pressure on ministry leaders
to reach people in nontraditional ways, and fund their ministries through a

encounter numerous individuals and families who need pastoral and spiritual
support but lack connection to a traditional faith community. Clergy who were

<p>IVM will offer programming to laity and clergy at varying stages of their

<br/><b>
</b><p><b>About us</b><br/>
I’ m a 40 years<span>  old computer technician
and I have a passion for new technologies. The high prices of hardware are
behind  my business idea.<br/>
Adinformatik , a  young company created
in 2014, and set up in the Caribbean, wishes to enable its prospective customer
to enjoy reasonable, we can even say attractive prices. All our items will be
sold exclusively on the Internet.<br/>
Recognized partners accompany me in the project and are waiting impatiently <br/></span></p>
<p><span>for me to launch the business.</span></p>
<p><b>What do we need?</b></p>
<p>Here is my plan:

Technicien en informatique, âgé de 40ans, passionné par les nouvelles technologies ,en me penchant sur le coût actuel du matériel informatique , je me suis dis et  demander pourquoi ne pas créer ma propre structure.
Adinformatik , jeune entreprise créée en octobre 2014, domicilié aux Antilles et installée à Paris, a la volonté de vouloir proposer   des prix raisonnablement corrects pour ne pas dire attractifs. Tous nos produits seront exclusivement commercialisés sur  Internet.
M’accompagnent dans ce projet des partenaires reconnus et qui n’attendent que lelancement.

Ce dont nous avons
  besoin
Notre démarche est la suivante : tout d’abord constituer une trésorerie de 8000€ pour pouvoir par la suite garantir à nos clients un service de qualité et commercialiser nos produits sur les sites  http://www.adinformatik.com
et www.ad-ebook.com.
Le  projet ne se limitera pas
seulement  à la  vente de matériel informatique. Il comprendra aussi la vente de  livres numériques car je crois à la survie des écrits et de la littérature.
Garantir nos fournisseurs, payer les 
charges qui nous incombent et développer nos catalogues respectifs.
Pour se faire, dans un premier temps nous commercialiserons  pour ADK (Adinformatik) aux Antilles et en France  Métropolitaine et au fil de l'eau nous continuerons notre progression .En ce qui concerne les livres numériques, la  commercialisation se fera exclusivement sur le Net. Je suis capable de vous en proposer un large choix si vous m’en donnez la possibilité.
Comment ?  En prenant déja  le temps nécessaire  à  lire notre article et surtout en nous apportant votre  contribution, si minime soit-elle. Nous vous en  remercions par avance.

Je vous invite   tous simplement à  ne pas nous 
oublier  et si vous en  avez l’opportunité n’hésitez pas à partager avec vos amis, collègues et familles nos liens,nos adresses ou  en prononçant juste un mot « Adinformatik ».
Nous croyons en l’avenir et surtout nous souhaitons que les  prix du matériel informatique soient à la portée de tous et surtout qu’ « Adinformatik » se positionne 
dans cette  dynamique et cela grace a vous.
Nous remercions d'emblée toutes les personnes qui prendront le
  temps et le plaisir nécessaire à lire notre article et pour ceux qui ne
  pourraient contribuer . 

  Les remerciements sont de mise et je vous invite tous à ne pas nous oublier  encore une fois  pensez juste un mot   « adinformatik ».  
  Je vous souhaite à tous  une bonne lecture et au plaisir de vous revoir.
  Sur nos sites ..

About us
I’ m a 40 years  old computer technician
and I have a passion for new technologies. The high prices of hardware are
behind  my business idea.

in 2014, and set up in the Caribbean, wishes to enable its prospective customer
to enjoy reasonable, we can even say attractive prices. All our items will be
sold exclusively on the Internet.
Recognized partners accompany me in the project and are waiting impatiently 
for me to launch the business.
What do we need?

pay the different charges and develop ourrespective catalogues.

In order to do that, we’ll start with selling for ADK (Adinformatik) in the
Caribbean Islands  and  in France .And secondly  we will of course continue to increase.With regard to e-books, they will be sold exclusively on the Internet. I will be able to offer you a big choice if you give me this possibility.

<p><b>The
Backstory</b></p>
<p>I love sweets! I love making them, I
love eating them, and I love sharing them with others. Cookies, candies, pound cakes…For
years, I would buy the box, follow the recipe and pat myself on the back for
‘making them myself’ instead of buying them ready-made and full of
preservatives.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know. I laugh at myself now,
too.</p>
<p>I quit smoking one day. Later that
day, I took up eating. After a few months (and a couple dozen pounds), I
started actually reading the labels on what I was putting in my mouth. I didn’t
like what I saw, so I started gathering recipes and learned how to bake. A few years
after <i>that</i>, the Farmer Assurance
Provision became a thing (commonly referred to as the Monsanto Protection Act).
Horrified, I threw out everything in my pantry and started over.</p>
<p>Petty’s Petits is the end result.
Oh, they’re not the most figure-friendly snacks on the market, but they <i>are</i> absolutely organic,
preservative-free and as GMO-free as I can get them. They are also the most
delicious thing you’ll put in your mouth today. I have refined my favorite
recipes into works of art, applied for and received my business license, and
I’m ready to share my creations with the world! </p>
<p>I just need your help.</p>
<p>The cottage food industry is
rapidly-growing, producing ever-increasing quantities of honey, breads and
cakes, cookies, jams and fruit pies in uninspected home kitchens across
America. Farmers’ markets, craft shows and roadside stands are all places
cottage foods call home. We are small businesses (under $15,000 annual gross
revenue), but we create big tastes and we have big dreams! </p>
<p>I have brought Petty’s Petits as far
as I can by myself. Will you make a contribution, try some of my cookies and
help me take it further?</p>
<p><b>The Numbers</b></p>
<p>Although my primary job for the last
25 years has been ‘single mom’, I <i>have</i>
dabbled in other things (such as Compliance and Risk Management), and I <i>do</i> have a degree in Business Management.
After running the numbers, I have determined that I will need approximately $5,000
in donations to cover the following start-up expenses (and any funds received
will be spent in this order):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>30% self-employment tax on any
donations received (wow!)</p></li>
<li><p>Indiegogo’s facilitation fees</p></li>
<li><p>perk ingredient and packaging
inventories</p></li>
<li><p>Kitchenaid professional mixer (not
the tilt-up model)</p></li>
<li><p>company phone</p></li>
<li><p>website</p></li>
<li><p>banking fees</p></li>
<li><p>business cards and labels</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Any funds received in excess of my
goal will be put towards Phase Two (a food truck – see below)!</p>
<p><b>The Deal</b></p>
<p>So what do you, the philanthropist,
get out of helping me reach my goal (besides a warm, fuzzy feeling)? </p>
<p>Well, you get to see what all the
fuss is about. For a $20 donation (plus shipping), I will send you one dozen Key
Lime White Chocolate Chip cookies. (<i>Except
for my Key Lime Cheesecake, these cookies are my most-requested item!</i>) For
$50 (plus shipping), you get two dozen cookies and a half dozen Butterballs. A
$100 donation (plus shipping) will score you three dozen cookies and two dozen
Butterballs. For $200, I will immortalize you as a custom petit recipe and put
you on the menu! </p>
<p><b><i>***All products
contain gluten and dairy! Butterballs contain nuts!***</i></b></p>
<p><i>*shipping charges will be invoiced via PayPal after campaign
ends*</i></p>
<p><b>The
Vision</b></p>
<p>Cottage industry operations are, by
law, very small, but Petty’s Petits has bigger dreams! Once we get too big for
the home kitchen, we have our sights set on a food truck – traveling the
country, meeting new people and sharing the love. Our ultimate goal? To open an
Earth Ship bed &amp; breakfast with an in-house bakery: a permanent,
eco-friendly, self-sustainable home for Petty’s Petits for generations to come.
But…..first things first!</p>
<p>By supporting Petty’s Petits, you’ll
be helping a single mom chase the American dream: to give up her two jobs and
have the <i>liberty </i>to <i>pursue</i> a <i>life </i>that brings <i>happiness</i>.
Cookies, clusters, cakes – everybody loves these things! And I love making
them! It’s a win-win, no matter how you look at it, and the fact that GMO-users
will be losing business is the best bonus I can think of. Help send them a
message (since our politicians <i>won’t</i>)
by giving Petty’s Petits the chance to compete! </p>
<p><b>The
Problem</b></p>
<p>It’s hard to keep a small business alive.
Half of them die within their first year. That’s why I’m asking for a full
year’s worth of funding up front. I don’t have to lease commercial space
(cottage kitchens are, by law, required to be in your own home), but I <i>do </i>need a hosted website, a business
phone, a business bank account…as well as everything else I haven’t even
thought of, yet. With your help, Petty’s Petits will be able to weather that
critical first year (and the inevitable learning curve).</p>
<p><b>The
Assist</b></p>
<p>We need all the help we can get to
get our name out there! Money is always nice, but there <i>are</i> things that youcan
do to help that won’t cost you a dime:</p>

<li><p>Got friends? Share the link to my
campaign on your Facebook – tag your friends who love sweets! Remember, Petty’s

<p><b></b></p>We are providing a 
home, experienced care takers and love to children in Kenema, Sierra 
Leone who have lost a responsible parent due to Ebola.  Most recently we 
located M'Balu Kamara, affectionately nicknamed Sweetie by nurses on the
 ebola ward after she arrived there with her sick mother who was too ill
 to tell them her daughter's name. You can read the New York Times 
article about her <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/14/world/africa/an-ebola-orphans-plea-in-africa-do-you-want-me.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.
  Since the writing of that article Sweetie and her older brother Abdul 
were taken in by a health care worker, but her livelihood was again 
threatened when he too became ill with the disease. This past <span><span>Saturday</span>,
 while Sierra Leone was under a three day lockdown in which people were 
not allowed to leave their homes, we delivered food, clothes and toys to
 Sweetie and her adoptive family. Tracing children who have become 
orphans and ensuring that they are safe and cared for is essential in an
 environment like Sierra Leone, where 1 in 5 children die before age 5 
from preventable diseases and children without stable homes are at risk 
for being trafficked or becoming street children. Help us provide hope 
that these children won't succumb to these circumstances. </span>(See photos of our visit with Sweetie on the updates tab).<br/><p></p>

Substances issues de la pétrochimie, parabens, colorants synthétiques et fragrances chimiques sont malheureusement les principaux composants de cette industrie continuant de rapporter plus d'un milliard de dollars au Canada chaque année.Très jeune, mon intérêt pour l’univers de la femme, de la beauté et des tendances m’a mené à poser un regard critique sur l’industrie du maquillage. Animée par le désir d'offrir aux femmes des cosmétiques frais composés d'ingrédients de qualité, et outillée de ma formation académique en design de produits, j'ai démarré en août 2014 mon entreprise de produits de maquillage naturel: Égérie Cosmétiques. 
















Égérie Cosmétiques est une entreprise québécoise offrant des produits de maquillage issus à 100% d’ingrédients naturels. Sa mission première est de proposer aux femmes des produits de maquillage soulignant leur beauté sans aucun ingrédient nocif pour la santé.






Dans le but d'une consommation avertie, Égérie Cosmétiques a également comme mission d'éduquer les femmes en les aidant à faire des liens entre les ingrédients et leurs propriétés. En sachant ce qu'elles consomment, les femmes seront ainsi en mesure d'établir leurs propres standards de qualité.



Finalement, de par son image très actuelle et sa recherche constante de tendances, Égérie Cosmétiques se distingue des autres marques de produits de maquillage naturel en offrant des produits reflétant réellement la femme d'aujourd'hui.












Ainsi donc, en contribuant à cette levée de fonds, c'est tout le processus de création de produit que vous encouragez, de l'achat des ingrédients à la présentation des produits en magasins.



Voyez les merveilleux cadeaux qui vous seront offerts en contreparties de votre soutien!

<p>As CCC grows and we receive contributions from those sympathetic to this program's goal, we commit to adding more Compassionate Need patients, and will continue to accept applications for those spots for when they become available. </p>

<h3>How the Program Works:</h3>
<p>Compassionate Need Program members receive partial or full assistance in paying for their medication, for most patients the entire charge is paid using the program's funding. </p>
<p>This enrollment lasts for three months and qualifies patients for assistance of up to $500/month worth of medication, as their treatment plan requires. CCC maintains close relationships with those patients and physicians who are involved in our Compassionate Need Program. </p>
<h3>
<br/>Enrollment:</h3>
<p> Compassionate Need applicants must be registered as CT MMP patients, have designated Compassionate Care Center of CT as their dispensary, provide proof of financial need, and provide a letter or e-mail to CCC from the physician who is currently treating their qualifying condition expressing that the patient would benefit from being enrolled in the program and that they are willing receive updates on the patient's treatment plan from our dispensary. </p>

Nicaragua’s Caribbean coast have a long history of struggle for territorial
rights. After the resolution of armed conflict with the Nicaraguan state in the
1980s, they won regional autonomy and began to mobilize for territorial
recognition.  The Inter-American
Court of Human Rights recognized their rights to communal property in 2001.  The ruling is supported by Law 445,
which provides the legal framework for territorial demarcation and governance
in Nicaragua.  In accordance with
the law, the state has titled 36,440 km<sup>2 </sup>of territory to these
communities.  Now one of the
largest infrastructure projects in history threatens their hard-won victory.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span><br/></p>
<p>The 2013 Nicaraguan Law 840 grants the Chinese-owned Hong
Kong Nicaragua Canal Development Company (HKND) exclusive rights to construct
and operate a US$50 billion interoceanic waterway three times the length of the
Panama Canal.  The canal will
bisect the Rama-Kriol Territory, which received an inalienable and
non-transferable title in 2009. It will also impact the territory claimed by
the Black Creole Indigenous Community of Bluefields, which is in the midst of
the demarcation and titling process.</p>
<p>In developing the project, the state has failed to follow
laws that guarantee indigenous and Afro-descendant rights to participate in
decisions that affect their territories, even though the canal will irrevocably
alter the way of life for communities in its path.  For instance, the planned port at the Caribbean terminus
will displace the indigenous Rama people of Bangkukuk Taik, the last community
with more than five Rama language speakers.  Canal construction also will dramatically impact the
environment, biological diversity, and local subsistence economies, even
creating a massive artificial lake in the Cerro Silva Natural
Reserve.</p>
<p>Indigenous and Afro-descendant communities are fighting
back.  Thanks to generous
supporters of an Indiegogo campaign (<a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/monkey-point-legal-defense-fund"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Monkey Point Legal Defense Fund</a>), communal
leaders filed a complaint with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights
(IACHR) in June of 2014 to protest the state’s failure to consult with their
communities. As the IACHR considers the complaint, the communities’ legal
representative, <a href=""http://www.calpi-nicaragua.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dr. Maria Luisa Acosta</a>, filed an additional request for
precautionary measures after the official groundbreaking of the canal project
in December of 2014. This is an emergency mechanism meant to protect
communities at risk of irreparable harm and is independent of the initial case.  To ensure that the request for
precautionary measures and the broader case against the Nicaraguan state succeed,
we must raise $4,000 to support her legal work and travel.
Donations of all sizes are deeply appreciated.</p>
<p>The fund will be administered by Jennifer Goett and Josh
Mayer and will be used only for expenses and fees directly associated with the
case.  Jennifer Goett is an

Unlike many residential facilities for the homeless, a stay at BOF is not limited by the calendar our residents are encouraged to stay until they are emotionally stable, have secureemployment, and are fully capable of living independently. BOF is not ashelter, it is a home. Residents are provided with a private, nicely furnishedbedroom and have complete access to common areas of the home and its outdoorgardens. They have housekeeping responsibilities and work together as a familyunit. Our HOMEs are not just a “quick fix” but the permanency that generatestrust and produces life-long results. So we ask: If you could save a life, would you?We understand not everyone may be able to contribute to our humble cause, however, if you are breathing we need you! We are always looking for volunteers or simply help us share our campaign with your friends or relatives. Please make sure to use the ""share tools"" from this page.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441912406/mjfklomzt67ichkk9rp1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div><div>After returning home from China with our daughter in 2007, I realized my passion is to help adoptive families raise the money they need to complete their adoption. Utilizing my 25-years as a fund-raising professional, I created a system of web-based, innovative tools and resources that would assist adoptive families in reaching their financial goals. After testing the tools and coaching numerous families with great success, today our services are licensed to adoption agencies and professionals across the country. When an adoption agency or professional partners with <b>Your Adoption Finance Coach</b>, they are helping their families solve the money problem and create a comprehensive financial plan that aligns with their adoption plan -- bringing their family together forever! <br/><div> <h3><br/></h3> </div> <div> <h3>Help Us Grow</h3> <p></p>Currently, we are serving 17 adoption agencies and professionals and over 450 families. Through word of mouth, and a proven track record, we are experiencing tremendous growth everyday! Our business model is based on agencies paying a license fee to offer our service to their families. We provide unlimited coaching and access to our services to the family. We never charge our families to participate in our programs.  Our current coaching staff is very close to reaching their capacity and we want to be able to serve more families! The agencies are limited in the amount of money they can pay for our services because most are nonprofit entities. Therefore, we are seeking<i> <b>support to build our team and hire three more adoption finance coaches that will be able to serve over 300 more families. </b></i>The success of this campaign will allow more families access to our services through their adoption service provider. </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p><b>1-in-3 American’s are touched by Adoption! </b>The taboo and secrecy of adoption from years ago is finally disappearing as more and more choose to build their family in this extraordinary way! Yet, still so many do not pursue adoption as a path. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441912595/ghrdlgzfg0hwdunraz55.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>According to the Dave Thomas Foundation, 2/3 of American’s consider adoption each year, yet only 2% actually complete an adoption. We recognize that while there are other barriers, <b>the #1 barrier is the high cost!</b></p>
<p>Whether domestic or international adoption, the costs range from <b>$25,000 - $60,000</b>. A very small percentage of prospective adoptive parents show up to the path of adoption with this kind of money ready to complete the process. In fact, it’s the opposite. Most find themselves on the path after an expensive and emotional journey through infertility treatments or other costly options that they've attempted. </p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Path</h3>The path of adoption is typically through a licensed agency or attorney and the problem of money further exasperates itself because many of these professionals lack the core competency to help their families create a financial plan. The adoption plan alone is extensive --homestudy, medical reports, background checks-- the adoption service provider has a full plate in just completing the adoption.<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441912789/kzed3jagffxxnxrqpzhv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Yet, overlooked by the provider is the <b>PAIN</b> that the family is feeling about the <b>MONEY!</b> This slows down the process and many families get stuck not knowing what to do first or how to create a financial plan for their adoption.<p></p>
<h3>We Solve the Money Problem</h3>
<p>The <b>Adoption Finance Coaching System</b> is a web-based, innovative system, which includes live and online coaching, on-demand training videos, budgeting and planning templates, an online gift registry service and more. This system provides adoptive families with the tools they need to create a comprehensive financial plan to fund their adoption.  Each plan is customized to fit their needs. Your Adoption Finance Coach partners with adoption agencies, professionals and attorneys throughout the country to provide this unique service to their clients, differentiating themselves from their competition and allowing them to do what they do best; <b>creating families</b>!</p>
<p>The video below is an example of Kelly Ellison, explaining to new prospective families how to use the tools and resource and how the system works.  <br/></p>

</div>
<div>
<div>This video is one example of over four hours of content that is provided to families, along with the assistance of a personalized coach customizing a financial plan that fits their needs.  Adoption is a complex road; our services aligned with the adoption service provider helps the adoptive family so they don't have to go through this alone!</div>

</div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
</div>
<div>Adoption is a niche market and gaining the trust of industry leaders has had its challenges, but we have overcome those challenges, established our credibility and added value to the market,  growing from only 3 agencies in 2013 to 17 today.</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Currently, our challenge is to deliver high quality services while we continue to grow. Making sure that our families are successful with writing grants, getting loans and raising the money they need to complete their adoptions is key to our success. Our agency partners entrust in us their most precious resource, their clients, and we take that very seriously. </span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Every person on our team has been touched by adoption.  It's necessary to have this as a company philosophy.  Our team has had the experience and walked in the adoptive parent's shoes so we can properly support these families on their journey. As we grow, we are eager to bring to our team more professionals who have adoption experience who want to help others build their families in this incredible way!</span></div>

</div></div>","My Story

After returning home from China with our daughter in 2007, I realized my passion is to help adoptive families raise the money they need to complete their adoption. Utilizing my 25-years as a fund-raising professional, I created a system of web-based, innovative tools and resources that would assist adoptive families in reaching their financial goals. After testing the tools and coaching numerous families with great success, today our services are licensed to adoption agencies and professionals across the country. When an adoption agency or professional partners with Your Adoption Finance Coach, they are helping their families solve the money problem and create a comprehensive financial plan that aligns with their adoption plan -- bringing their family together forever!     Help Us Grow Currently, we are serving 17 adoption agencies and professionals and over 450 families. Through word of mouth, and a proven track record, we are experiencing tremendous growth everyday! Our business model is based on agencies paying a license fee to offer our service to their families. We provide unlimited coaching and access to our services to the family. We never charge our families to participate in our programs.  Our current coaching staff is very close to reaching their capacity and we want to be able to serve more families! The agencies are limited in the amount of money they can pay for our services because most are nonprofit entities. Therefore, we are seeking support to build our team and hire three more adoption finance coaches that will be able to serve over 300 more families. The success of this campaign will allow more families access to our services through their adoption service provider.   The Impact 1-in-3 American’s are touched by Adoption! The taboo and secrecy of adoption from years ago is finally disappearing as more and more choose to build their family in this extraordinary way! Yet, still so many do not pursue adoption as a path. 


According to the Dave Thomas Foundation, 2/3 of American’s consider adoption each year, yet only 2% actually complete an adoption. We recognize that while there are other barriers, the #1 barrier is the high cost!
Whether domestic or international adoption, the costs range from $25,000 - $60,000. A very small percentage of prospective adoptive parents show up to the path of adoption with this kind of money ready to complete the process. In fact, it’s the opposite. Most find themselves on the path after an expensive and emotional journey through infertility treatments or other costly options that they've attempted. 

The PathThe path of adoption is typically through a licensed agency or attorney and the problem of money further exasperates itself because many of these professionals lack the core competency to help their families create a financial plan. The adoption plan alone is extensive --homestudy, medical reports, background checks-- the adoption service provider has a full plate in just completing the adoption.
Yet, overlooked by the provider is the PAIN that the family is feeling about the MONEY! This slows down the process and many families get stuck not knowing what to do first or how to create a financial plan for their adoption.
We Solve the Money Problem
The Adoption Finance Coaching System is a web-based, innovative system, which includes live and online coaching, on-demand training videos, budgeting and planning templates, an online gift registry service and more. This system provides adoptive families with the tools they need to create a comprehensive financial plan to fund their adoption.  Each plan is customized to fit their needs. Your Adoption Finance Coach partners with adoption agencies, professionals and attorneys throughout the country to provide this unique service to their clients, differentiating themselves from their competition and allowing them to do what they do best; creating families!
The video below is an example of Kelly Ellison, explaining to new prospective families how to use the tools and resource and how the system works.  
    


This video is one example of over four hours of content that is provided to families, along with the assistance of a personalized coach customizing a financial plan that fits their needs.  Adoption is a complex road; our services aligned with the adoption service provider helps the adoptive family so they don't have to go through this alone!
Check out: www.youradoptionfinancecoach.com for more testimonials, stories, resources and agencies providing our services.

Risks & Challenges  

Adoption is a niche market and gaining the trust of industry leaders has had its challenges, but we have overcome those challenges, established our credibility and added value to the market,  growing from only 3 agencies in 2013 to 17 today.
Currently, our challenge is to deliver high quality services while we continue to grow. Making sure that our families are successful with writing grants, getting loans and raising the money they need to complete their adoptions is key to our success. Our agency partners entrust in us their most precious resource, their clients, and we take that very seriously. 
Every person on our team has been touched by adoption.  It's necessary to have this as a company philosophy.  Our team has had the experience and walked in the adoptive parent's shoes so we can properly support these families on their journey. As we grow, we are eager to bring to our team more professionals who have adoption experience who want to help others build their families in this incredible way!

We are excited to launch our first crowd-funding campaign to fund a maternal health clinic in El Salvador, one of the Central American countries where the Mayan civilization thrived.We are working towards …Building a health clinic for at risk pregnant teens in an underserved community in El Salvador on land owned by the community. The clinic will provide prenatal and postnatal care as well as much needed health education for both mothers and fathers. This clinic will benefit young women like Carolina and Eva and young children like Jorgito.We believe strong and healthy families are a foundation for strong communities. Did you know …El Salvador is one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere. On average people in El Salvador live on less than $2 USD per day.According to FISDL (Investment Fund for Local Development in El Salvador) the average family in Caluco survives on only $30 USD per month ($1 USD per day). [3]The risk of complications from pregnancy is highest for young adolescent girls (11-19). [4] Skilled care before, during and after childbirth can save the lives of women and newborn babies and reduce the incidence of disability.[5] These young women, properly cared for, can then contribute to their community. Additionally, educating expectant mothers and fathers will help strengthen families which will strengthen the community. During our February 2015 trip to El Salvador, PAUR met with Alejandra, Zaira and Karla - three beautiful young girls from Caluco. The girls explained why their community needed a clinic for young mothers. Each of the girls had friends who were pregnant as teenagers but did not receive adequate care because of the lack of a facility where private and dignified healthcare services could be provided. They expressed their concerns for the future of the community if the young mothers do not get proper care during pregnancy. Currently, the community of Caluco has 104 pregnant women, of which 24 are adolescents. In some cases a woman as young as 19 is on her third child.  [6]We work with trusted local organizations …For this project, we are partnering with ESNA Village Network (ESNA). ESNA is a non-profit which connects villages in rural El Salvador with communities in North America to develop sustainable and effective partnerships to build lasting social change.  PAUR has worked with ESNA Village Network for the past 6 years in the community of Caluco with great success.Why work with us …PAUR has worked with other Rotary Clubs and NGOs in El Salvador for 10 years. For the past 8 years, we have focused our attention in the rural community of Caluco, located in Sonsonate. When PAUR first began working with Caluco, the community was ranked as 246th poorest of 252 ranked communities in El Salvador. Over the past 8 years, working closely with the community, PAUR and its partners have helped raise the community’s ranking 40 spaces to 206th in the country. [7] The PAUR projects focus on health, education and economic development.  More information about other projects that PAUR has participated in can be found on the PAUR International Committee YouTube channel. IMPORTANT NOTE: Money raised will be applied towards the building of the health clinic. If we fall short of the  fundraising goal, we will hold the funds raised in reserve and continue raising money  until our goal is reached. Any additional funds raised will be used to purchase equipment and furnishings for the clinic (estimated at $15,000 USD) or to rehabilitate and expand a local primary school in the community (rehabilitation estimated at $50,000 USD; expansion to cover grades through high school estimated at $90,000 USD). Rotarians travel at their own expense to monitor the progress of the projects we fund. $100% of what we raise will go to the community.How we will spend the money we raise …Putting your donation into practical terms…Every little bit helps!Imagine, giving up one  latte could buy 8 building blocks; a week of lunches 5 bags of cement.Other ways you can help …If you can’t donate, please consider helping us anyway! Share our campaign with family and friends. Sources …

countries. See, World Health Organization, http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs348/en/
Dr. Antonio Hernandez of FUDECOM (El

maternal deaths per 1000 births, 65% of maternal deaths occur in women from 15
to 29 years old, there are 20 infant deaths per 1000 births.

Saturday from 2 – 10 pm. A local designer and contractor are working with us to
create a hip and comfortable space.

Uncorked!
The Gourmet Cellar Uncorked story
Gourmet Cellar Uncorked is very close to being open daily. When completed, it will be a cozy place to meet your friends
after work, a day on the river or cross country skiing in Yellowstone. It’s a
place to experience wonderful wines (or beers) with cheeses and specialty
meats procured both locally and from around the globe.

While under construction, Gourmet Cellar Uncorked is only open Fridays for wine tastings. With your support it will soon be a complete, comfortable, unpretentious wine bar for you and your friends to relax, catch up
and enjoy life in Livingston!

This is both a blessing and a curse.  A blessing because we've been in dire need of an update, and a curse because the cost of a new (to us) freezer is much more than we imagined. This is where you come in.  Any donation: big, small, or somewhere in the middle, will be a great help to us as an agency as we continue to do the work that we've been doing since opening our doors. Your financial support will help us provide food security to families throughout Klickitiat and Skamania counties. Some families need help just once, while others require ongoing services to meet their food needs.  We provide special boxes for seniors who are often on a fixed income, and for children, who might need extra help during the summer when school lunches aren't an option. You can make an impact right here in your community and help address the needs of your friends and neighbors by donating to our campaign. Thank you for taking the time to watch our video, and thank you for your donation. You can make a donation through Indiegogo by clicking on the button to the right on your screen, you can mail a donation directly to WGAP, PO BOX 805, Bingen, Washington, 98605, or you can go to our website, www.wgap.ws, and donate through Paypal.

<p>A FREE Android app will be launched on Google Play in the next few days, with the iOS version to come next. Even though I've spent quite a bit of money and a lot of time on the concept and creation, I chose to keep the app completely FREE to make it available to everyone.

<p>So if you like what my app offers, for both users and advertisers, please support my Indiegogo campaign, even with just a small contribution, because every little bit helps – but bigger bits help more of course! </p>
<p>Funds raised will go towards launching the full version, then to completing the next crucial updates on both platforms.

Btw, I'm not the dog, but the human who's sometimes in the photos too.





I've been using Instagram for about 13 months now and observed something. It has to do with ""shoutouts"", which is Instagram-speak for ""ads"".
I noticed advertisers only choose users with lots of followers, a.k.a influencers, to work with. It seems logical, on the surface, that these popular users get advertising offers. But, in reality, less will get you much more. 
Here's what I mean: I discovered that the more followers an influencer has, the less engaged their followers are, i.e. a lower percentage leave ""comments"" and ""likes"".

Also, I've a long list of user-centric functions I've always wished Instagram offered – follow #hashtags (instead of just users), view #trends (by country), and simple corrections, such as being able to copy-and-paste text, click on URL links, etc. With more funds, I'll add these and more – and still keep the app FREE!It would be helpful for advertisers to have a simple-yet-comprehensive analytics page too, so they can understand why some shoutouts do better than others, and that's on the drawing board as well.Right now, in FULL alphabetical order, I am ALL of the following:• Architect • Barista (coffee for sleepless nights) • Creator (please see Architect) • Designer (please see Creator) • Editor • Founder • General Laborer • HR Manager (managing…myself) • Intern (I do do A-Z you know) • Japanese (really) • Korean (no, really) • Lawyer (someone needs to craft the Terms!) • Marketer • Networker (please see Marketer) • Operations Manager • Photographer (we all are on Instagram!) • Quality Controller • Researcher • System Administrator • There's-no-I-in-TEAM-but-there's-M-and-E (actually, there's no TEAM. Period.) • Unpaid Worker • Videographer (youtube.com/watch?v=eVrP8OLabUU) • Writer • Xtensive Tester (only other thing I can come up with is ""Xylophone Player"") • Yikes... (I know you're thinking of ""Yoga Instructor"" but I'm just not that flexible), and • Zookeeper (I've quite a few animals at home)So, it would be nice to start hiring some help too #prayhard.

Funds will mainly be used for cloud hosting, as despite its name (cloud), the cost isn't fluffy at all. Simultaneously hosting millions of users, accessing-accepting shoutouts at virtually the same time, verifying that advertisers' shoutouts aren't altered at all, ensuring influencers are paid automatically and on-time via Paypal, and storing cloud-loads of data, are estimated to cost tens of thousands of dollars a year! #cloudyeyes.I'll also need to spend on marketing, as the more advertisers know about the power of everyday users, the more users earn! In the meantime, I'll gather all useful feedback to launch the next version on other platforms, starting with Twitter, and users will have more avenues to earn more money!So… if you believe in the power of everyday users, and if you'd like to earn money by simply accepting shoutouts, please support my Indiegogo campaign and help spread the word to everyone you know! Every bit of help, well, helps!Thank you so much for helping!
LOUDHOLLER could change the world by granting power to everyone to make money easily from our Instagram accounts! Also, I've a marketing plan to make it the fastest downloaded app, ever. So, if you wish to work with me, whoever you are, wherever you are, in whatever role, please email shout@loudholler.com whenever you can. Whyever (everkill, I mean overkill already right)? I could so use the help, and will be forever (can't resist that last one) grateful. However, #heh, you'd need to be darn good for the role you're offering to fill k, because I'll just never compromise on user experience...Together let's make history :)",14.0,0,"1 Campaign

</h3><h3><br/></h3><div><br/></div><h3>Campaign Intro &amp; Overview</h3><p>
The Island of Montserrat has been referred to as ""the way the Caribbean
used to be"". It is also widely-referred to as ""the Emerald Isle of
the Caribbean"". A place so cool that famed producer of The Beatles, Sir
George Martin, built a state-of-the-art recording complex there in 1976 where
the likes of Sir Paul McCartney, The Police, and Sir Elton John recorded
multi-platinum albums.</p><p>Fast-forward to present-day, post-volcano Montserrat. ...Imagine a place so quiet that you can actually hear yourself breathe. With virtually no large hotels or resorts, Montserrat is off the beaten path and you will feel like a sixteenth century explorer discovering a new land. Witness first-hand the utter devastation of the Volcano on Montserrat's capital of Plymouth, now a modern-day Pompeii. </p>
<p>The Island is an enchanting place,
its charm endearing. The people of Montserrat are genuinely warm; it's the kind
of place where people wave at each other on the roads and are never in too much
of a hurry to get anywhere. A British-Crown Colony, the Island is a safe travel
destination and a haven for retirees from North America &amp; the U.K.
Montserrat boasts sublime spring water from the tap, a balmy year-round
climate, and stunning natural beauty.</p>
<p>Carrll &amp; Gary Robilotta are
brothers who moved to the Caribbean Island of Montserrat in 1980 where they
pioneered the sport of surfing. After going through two natural disasters on
the Island (Hurricane Hugo in 1989 and then the eruption of the Soufriere Hills
Volcano in 1995), the brothers are now in the process of restoring/transforming
their long-time family home into an adventure tour destination/accommodation company. </p>
<p>The Montserrat Island Adventure
Villa will be a one-of-a-kind accommodation in Montserrat. With your help, we
will create a fully-outfitted villa which will provide crowd-weary adventurers
with a great opportunity to explore this beautiful island, meet and interact with its wonderful people, and unplug from the frantic pace of life most of the world lives in. As a contributor, you will
enjoy some great discounts when you book your one, two, or three week adventures with us! </p>
<p>Catering to single families,
couples, and small groups, our all-inclusive offering will include deluxe villa
accommodations, guided kayak, stand-up paddleboarding, electric mountain bike excursions, and off-road motorcycling.
Avid watermen and outdoorsmen, the Brothers Robilotta will be your hosts &amp;
guides during your time on magical Montserrat. Best of all, pricing for our
all-inclusive adventure packages will be affordable--costing less what most hotels
charge for accommodations alone. </p>

<p><b><i>So what is Hoshana Management Group?</i></b></p>
We are a husband and wife
team that runs a company that helps local non-profits.  We started out just helping the local
non-profits in the community, and decided to turn it into a business to help
low-income communities as a whole. Because of the success we were having with our current non-profit partners, we decided to set up a membership website where our corporate
members donate to our non-profit partners continuously, thus fulfilling their need of
Corporate Social Responsibility... and most importantly, giving our NPO partners access to funding when ever they needed it.  We are dedicated to
transforming low-income communities into thriving places.  We both have an insatiable passion to help
change the lives of those who need it most. HMG Connects, would you like to help us on this
mission?<p></p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>

am here to tell you about Hoshana Management Group launching our first program campaign
called The Conex-zone.  We
developed this program in order to connect for-profit companies with non-profit
companies.  Corporations and companies
want to donate profits to charities and local funding but sometimes they don’t
know where to send the money where it will have the highest impact on the
community in which they serve.  We act as
a platform to connect the funding with the cause.  We think it will help people in need of a

<p><b>Overview</b></p>
<p>Our popular culture reinforces the idea
that getting funding can be one of the most difficult things an organization
can go through. We're out to change that fallacious idea one client at a time!
Help us establish this initiative to serve people in need of a solution. As
little as $5 gets an organization a little closer to their goals and can change
their ideas about what they can
accomplish for the rest of their life. 
Finding out your dreams can come true with ease will be life changing. Empower
us to make this vision a reality with a donation to this project today!</p>

<p>2.25% of non-profits take

<p>·<span> 
</span>Set up a membership website

<p>·<span>

</span>Small causes may find large

<p>When
reviewing these benefits, features and much more, it inspired and assured us
that this is a business that needs to be created. We feel if executed properly
we can reach a large market of people in need of an easier way to find funding.  Our features will make us incredibly
qualified to succeed in the industry. 
This paired with attention to detail and quality service will make us a
key player if not leader in the industry. Our mission is to take care of every funder,
supporter and customer with the upmost respect and care.  We feel this will be the key to our growth.</p>

often times a collaborative effort is necessary.  An environment where everyone pulls together
their resources to make one fully functioning machine of talent is the best way
to make your dreams come true.  It just
so happens our company Hoshana Management Group does just that.  If everyone pulls together and we can raise
funding, I know this can be a success!  
So what is Hoshana Management Group?
We are a husband and wife
team that runs a company that helps local non-profits.  We started out just helping the local
non-profits in the community, and decided to turn it into a business to help
low-income communities as a whole. Because of the success we were having with our current non-profit partners, we decided to set up a membership website where our corporate
members donate to our non-profit partners continuously, thus fulfilling their need of
Corporate Social Responsibility... and most importantly, giving our NPO partners access to funding when ever they needed it.  We are dedicated to
transforming low-income communities into thriving places.  We both have an insatiable passion to help
change the lives of those who need it most. HMG Connects, would you like to help us on this
mission?   
Join the Connection!
Hello, my name is Danavan Hylton and I
am here to tell you about Hoshana Management Group launching our first program campaign
called The Conex-zone.  We
developed this program in order to connect for-profit companies with non-profit
companies.  Corporations and companies
want to donate profits to charities and local funding but sometimes they don’t
know where to send the money where it will have the highest impact on the
community in which they serve.  We act as
a platform to connect the funding with the cause.  We think it will help people in need of a
solution for finding funding in these tough economic times.  We are dedicated to our non-profits and
finding sustainable solutions for our community.
Do you ever think about giving back but
don’t know where to do it?
Do you want to see local charities and
non-profits but don’t know how?
Are you interested in connecting with
an organization but don’t have the time?

  Information sessions will also be held at the shop, covering such topics as urban beekeeping, current research updates from CIBER (the bee research group at UWA), food and medicinal uses of honey and seasonal honey tastings.
The location (213 Railway Parade, Maylands) is next to a new local raw food cafe (The Little Shop of Plenty) and located near a number of medium to high-density residential developments that will contribute to the growing food and cafe scene in Maylands.

TheM dining place mats proactively maintain temperature to provide optimum heat release and distribution. When a hot dish is placed on TheM, the mat absorbs and stores the access heat. As the dish cools the excess stored heat is then released back to the dish to maintain the ideal temperature. This cycle works continuously.

TheM integrates cutting edge certified space technology into a high-end design. TheM Place Mats keep your dishes at the ideal eating temperature for 45 to 60 minutes.    TheM requires NO charging, NO wires, NO batteries all while being cool to the touch. Very kid friendly as it's not hot to the touch!NOTE: These mats have been tested to maintain temps for up to 120 minutes.




Outlast Phase Change Materials originally developed for NASA, to help balance temperature fluctuations in space, is integrated into the gel pad of TheM. This helps TheM Place Mats achieve optimum temperature management.The Outlast® Phase Change Materials is a heat managing technology that is also safe, non-toxic and renewable.

IMPORTANT - Ideal Temperature:
You slave over a hot meal and by the time your family and friends get to the table and start eating the temperature is less than optimal.Food is usually served at 185-195 degrees Fahrenheit. The ideal eating temperature is 145-155 degrees Fahrenheit. Our mats maintain the food in a dish or plate at >150 degrees (the ideal eating temperature) Fahrenheit for a minimum of 45 minutes to an hour.NOTE: These mats have been tested to maintain temps for up to 120 minutes.Design Assembly: Design & Specs:

TECHNOLOGYHow does Outlast's Phase Change Material work for heat control? 
While the PCM is changing phases and absorbing or releasing energy, it is preventing temperature change. This stored energy is known as latent heat and can be measured by the DSC.  
Solid toLiquid – melting, ice to water, candles to wax puddles. In order to melt, you have to add or absorb energy (endothermic). Liquid to Solid – crystallization, water to ice. In order to solidify, freeze, crystallize you have to remove or release energy (exothermic)  
latent heat (lĀt’nt hēt) nounThe quantity of heat absorbed or released by a substance undergoing a change of state, (such as ice changing to water or wax solidifying), at constant temperature and pressure.
When a solid material is heated and reaches its melting point, it goes from solid to liquid. During this process the material absorbs a certain amount of heat. Despite the heat input, the temperature of the material stays at a relatively constant level, even though phase change is taking place. We thus speak of latent (concealed) heat having been taken up by the material.  
 Outlast technology is based on the absorption, storage and release of energy. Outlast uses a phase change material (PCM) which is a material that requires large amounts of energy to change phases (solid to liquid and back to solid) in a specific temperature range.

With its octagon shape TheM is buildable and can be put together for larger dishes.  
You can use TheM under your dining plates to keep your food hot  
Put a hot tea or coffee pot on TheM to keep beverages hot  
Place your pizza directly on TheM - non-toxic & safe materials . Do not recommend cutting pizza on TheM.
Use TheM under your soup bowls  
Coffee or Tea mugs and cup to keep beverage warm
Take TheM on your camping trips, cookouts and barbeques
Your kids will love TheM as they take 1 hour to finish a hot dog and mac and cheese
And so much more...

<p>Hey I'm Heather Smith, a Chef born and raised in Baltimore
Maryland. </p>
<p>I’m
currently self employed as a Private Chef which means I get to travel and do
what I love at the same time. This restaurant has always been the point.
This is my dream. A space where great food and community happen. That's
where all of you come in! I cannot do it without you! </p>
<p>The
project specifically is remodeling an already existing restaurant space.
We're going to open up the top levels to create an event space, that will be used for cooking classes, private events, live music, <i>the works!</i></p>
<p>So, why
the name '12:34' (twelve thirty-four)? Ever since I can remember, I always catch that time on the clock, on my cell phone, when I'm home,
when I'm out, seriously, always. It's become almost soothing. LOL. It also
has, over time, become representative of time in the broader sense,
as in:</p>
<p>IT'S
TIME for us to stop being afraid to pursue our dreams.</p>
<p>IT'S TIME
for people to start eating food that they love and that loves them
back. </p>
<p>IT'S
TIME to stop feeling guilty for ""eating out"", because
I'm cooking with the same love and thoughtfulness that you would.</p>
<p>IT'S
TIME to have a space to go, to learn about good food and where it
comes from. </p>

TIME for the place you wish existed, where you can come in, put a record
on and enjoy food and service that’s second to none. </p>
<p>IT'S
TIME for '12:34'...</p><p>
</p><p>I have been in the food service industry for over fifteen
years, the last several years in a management role. Over the past four years I’ve
learned and grown so much, teaching food and nutrition at the elementary/middle
school level, I was the Chef on a farm, I taught Culinary Arts as part of an
Art program for young people on Aruba as well as at the High School level here
locally in Baltimore. Those experiences working with the youth, particularly of
my City, have been priceless. Your contribution will allow my teaching to
continue, just in a different setting. We are what we eat! Food is medicine –
at least it can and should be. Don’t eat that! 
These are things none of us would know unless someone told us. </p><p>IT’S TIME to demystify eating well.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444795859/gjllovp5bk4j5azqlhs6.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Let’s

<li><span>Wer sind wir?</span></li>
<li><span>Was brauchen wir?</span></li>

<p></p>
<h2 align=""center""><b><span>#WER</span></b></h2>
<p><span>Wir, Christopher (20) und Sebastian (28), sind das Team hinter my-food.at und möchten </span><span>den Online-Lebensmittelhandel in Österreich auf ein neues Level bringen. </span><span><br/></span></p>
<p><span>Wir
 alle sind Individualisten und haben individuelle Lebens- bzw. 
Ernährungsgewohnheiten. Allergien sind heutzutage weitverbreitet und 
alternative Essenausrichtungen gewinnen an Zuwachs. Diesen Wandel </span><span>unterstützen wir und bieten ein maßgeschneidertes Produkt dazu an</span><span>. </span></p>
<p><span>In herkömmlichen Online-Supermärkten </span><span>werden Produkte nach Produktgruppen sortiert</span><span> -</span><span>
 unpersönlich und standardisiert. Wir sortieren unsere Produkte nach 
unseren Kunden und Ihren Lebensausrichtungen - für eine einfache und 
schnelle Bestellung, ohne die Produktbeschreibung nach Allergenen oder 
Inhaltsstoffen zu durchsuchen zu müssen.</span></p>
<p><span><br/></span></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1301541/files/20150317033532-Startseite_Screenshot.png?1426588532"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p></p>
<h2 align=""center""><b><span>#WAS</span></b></h2>
<p><span>Eine
 kurze Hochrechnung ergab, dass wir unsere ersten Ausgaben nicht selbst 
aufwenden können - zu groß sind die Ausgaben für die ersten 
Lebensmittel, ein Transportfahrzeug oder die Kaution für unser Lager 
(Details siehe unten). Dennoch möchten wir nicht zu Lasten der Kunden 
Einsparungen treffen, die dazu führen, dass eines unserer Kernziele - 
die Kundenzufriendenheit - belastet.</span></p>
<p><span>Gerne geben wir euch einen kurzen Überblick, wie wir unser Budget verwenden möchten:<br/></span></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>Gründung der Rechtsform</span></li>
<li>Kaution für unser Zwischenlager</li>
<li>Kosten für Hygienestandards</li>
<li><span>Tiefkühl- und Kühlzellen</span></li>
<li><span>Lebensmittel Ersteinkauf </span></li>
<li><span>Werbungskosten</span></li>
<li><span>Kundentransportboxen</span></li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h2 align=""center""><b><span>#WIESO</span></b></h2>
<p><span>Die
 Individualisierung steht bei uns ganz oben. Wir fokussieren daher im 
Detail auf die gängigen Ernährungstrends, Allergien oder Krankheiten. 
Für alle Kunden die keines davon aufweisen bieten wir zusätzlich unser 
Produktportfolio wie üblich nach Warengruppen sortiert an. </span></p>

Gliederung:

Wer sind wir?
Was brauchen wir?
Wieso machen wir das?

Warum heben wir uns ab?

Wie könnt ihr uns unterstützen?
Wo wollen wir unser Projekt starten?
Was können wir abschließend noch sagen?




#WER
Wir, Christopher (20) und Sebastian (28), sind das Team hinter my-food.at und möchten den Online-Lebensmittelhandel in Österreich auf ein neues Level bringen. 
Wir
 alle sind Individualisten und haben individuelle Lebens- bzw. 
Ernährungsgewohnheiten. Allergien sind heutzutage weitverbreitet und 
alternative Essenausrichtungen gewinnen an Zuwachs. Diesen Wandel unterstützen wir und bieten ein maßgeschneidertes Produkt dazu an. 
In herkömmlichen Online-Supermärkten werden Produkte nach Produktgruppen sortiert -
 unpersönlich und standardisiert. Wir sortieren unsere Produkte nach 
unseren Kunden und Ihren Lebensausrichtungen - für eine einfache und 
schnelle Bestellung, ohne die Produktbeschreibung nach Allergenen oder 
Inhaltsstoffen zu durchsuchen zu müssen.



die Startseite von http://www.my-food.at

#WAS
Eine
 kurze Hochrechnung ergab, dass wir unsere ersten Ausgaben nicht selbst 
aufwenden können - zu groß sind die Ausgaben für die ersten 
Lebensmittel, ein Transportfahrzeug oder die Kaution für unser Lager 
(Details siehe unten). Dennoch möchten wir nicht zu Lasten der Kunden 
Einsparungen treffen, die dazu führen, dass eines unserer Kernziele - 
die Kundenzufriendenheit - belastet.
Gerne geben wir euch einen kurzen Überblick, wie wir unser Budget verwenden möchten:




Gründung der Rechtsform
Kaution für unser Zwischenlager
Kosten für Hygienestandards
Tiefkühl- und Kühlzellen
Lebensmittel Ersteinkauf 
Werbungskosten
Kundentransportboxen



#WIESO
Die
 Individualisierung steht bei uns ganz oben. Wir fokussieren daher im 
Detail auf die gängigen Ernährungstrends, Allergien oder Krankheiten. 
Für alle Kunden die keines davon aufweisen bieten wir zusätzlich unser 
Produktportfolio wie üblich nach Warengruppen sortiert an. 



Produktübersicht (beispielhaft hier Produkte der Firma Moser http://www.moserwurst.at) 


Wir haben die wichtigsten Gruppen herausgearbeitet und möchten in diese unterteilen:


Vegan
Vegetarisch
BIO
Fruktoseintoleranz
Laktoseintoleranz 
Nussalergie
Fischalergie
Diverse Diäten 
Diabetes 
Low Carb
Kraftnahrung






die Unterteilung in Kategorien auf http://www.my-food.at

#WARUM
Um
 die Individualisierung zu perfektionieren ist es selbstverständlich 
möglich, diese Gruppen über die Such- und Filterfunktion zu kombinieren.
 Wer sagt, dass ein Vegetarier nicht auch eine Nussallergie entwickeln 
kann? Durch diese und weitere Funktionen machen wir das Einkaufserlebnis perfekt.



unsere Filter- und Suchenfunktionen

Wir wissen selbstverständlich, dass es bereits von den großen Ketten
 auch Online-Shops Ihrer Produkte gibt. Dennoch - und im Speziellen weil
 wir so anders sind - glauben wir daran, dies besser umsetzten zu können. BIO-Lebensmittelgeschäfte sind zumeist teurer und trotzdem erfolgreich. Sie haben das Wichtigste umgesetzt: sie haben auf die Kundenwünsche reagiert.



nach der Auswahl der Kategorie sind alle Produkte angepasst z.B. vegetarisch

Auch
 in Sachen Lieferung möchten wir uns von anderen Shops unterscheiden und
 werden neben einer Zeitfester-Lieferung auch eine Liefermöglichkeit für unsere Kunden anbieten die eine 
Anwesenheit des Empfängers bei der Lieferung nicht voraussetzt. Du 
kannst unsere Produkte von jedem Ort der Welt bestellen und wenn 
du nach Hause kommst, sind deine Lebensmittel schon da - egal ob normale, gekühlte oder tiefgekühlte Waren - eine Art mobile Packstation macht dies möglich - nur viel einfacher - lass dich einfach überraschen, wir glauben, es wird dir gefallen. 


#WIE

Final words we want to say




#WHO
We, Christopher (20) and Sebastian (28), are the team behind my-food.at and we create a new way how to order food over the internet. Everybody needs different food because everyone is different. That's why our system reduces the amount of time, people need to collect their food into the basket - we pre-sort our products into lifestlyes or allergies to reduce the time for searching the right product.



startpage of http://www.my-food.at

#WHAT
To realize our idea, we need your help because there are many things we need to give our costumers the best service we can. 
We want to give you a short summary how we'd like to spend our budget:

legal form
deposit for our storage
reach a hygenic standard in the storage
freezing- and colling cells
first food purchage
advertisement
carriage boxes for clients 



#WHY
We care about the society's needs - that’s why nutrition trends, food allergies and diseases are our main focus. And we also serve food like in a normal online supermarket for those who don't have special nutritions or deseases.


product overview (here as an example with products of Firma Moser http://www.moserwurst.at)




At the beginning we focus on the following nutrition groups: 

Vegan 
Vegetarian 
Organic food 
Lactose intolerance 
Fructose intolerance 
Nut allergy 
Fish allergy 
Diabetes 
Low-Carb 
Sport nutrition

#WHICH

We are working veryhard on the database that this works properly and it never happens, that e.g. a product like salmon appears in the fish allergy category. Of course our customers don't see this effort - they just see the right products for them.

<p>We are a group of volunteers concerned with
socio-environmental issues from Mexico, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil,
Argentina, Panama, Venezuela, Spain, and the Muisca and Sapara nations. Our group is engage with
the vision and work of the Pachamama Alliance in Latin America and Spain. We
have a common purpose: to generate an environmentally sustainable, spiritually
fulfilling and socially just human presence on this planet.  In this process, we focus on creating a
critical mass of conscious committed citizens that can generate a more positive
future. In our work we </p>
<p>integrate the wisdom of the ancient people
with modern knowledge to support personal and group transformation.</p>
<p>For the past three years we
have met in different territories in order to create common strategies, share our
knowledge, learn together, make agreements and work on ourselves as human
beings. Our goal is to put all of this in the service of local communities and effectively
help to generate game changing actions.</p>
<p>This
year we have an ambitious plan: hold our annual meeting in the Sápara Indigenous
Nation (in the middle of the Amazon rainforest). We want to exchange knowledge
and learn from their community processes that have proven to be very effective
both in building social fabric as in their interaction with the natural world.
Our aim is to integrate this knowledge with the modern world to provide
sensitizing tools and actions that promote community development in the region
of Iberoamerica.  </p>
<p>We
also want to give our in conditional support to one of our leaders, Manari who
has been an example of the Sapara culture and a tireless activist in protecting
the Amazon rainforest. In 2001 the Sapara Nation was declared by the UNESCO as
Intangible Heritage of Humanity.</p>
<p>As
Manari says: “<i>We Saparas have developed
our own system of living, recognizing that all of the elements that make up
nature are living beings which have spirits equal to us. So we all need to help
one another in order to maintain the equilibrium of our lives and of nature”</i></p>
<p>Therefore this community
opened the doors of its territory to share with visitors their ancestral
knowledge, customs, stories, food and experiences that can only be explain in its
real magnitude within the forest.</p>
<h3><b>Quiénes
Somos</b></h3>
<p>Somos un grupo de líderes voluntarios de México,
Perú, Ecuador, Colombia, Brasil, Argentina, Panamá, Venezuela, España y las naciones Muisca y
Sápara; dedicados a expandir la visión y el trabajo de la Alianza Pachamama en Latinoamérica
y España.   Tenemos un propósito común: generar una presencia humana en el
planeta, que sea ambientalmente sustentable, socialmente justa y
espiritualmente plena. En este proceso nos concentramos en generar una masa
crítica de ciudadanos conscientes que puedan generar un futuro más
positivo. En nuestro trabajo integramos la sabiduría de los pueblos
ancestrales con los conocimientos modernos para apoyar transformaciones
personales y grupales.</p>
<p>Desde hace tres años, realizamos encuentros en
diferentes territorios para generar estrategias conjuntas, compartir saberes,
tener aprendizajes colectivos, hacer acuerdos y trabajar en nuestro SER,
para poner todo esto al servicio de las comunidades locales en las que tenemos
injerencia y generar efectivamente acciones que cambien el juego.</p>
<p>Este año tenemos un plan ambicioso: Realizar
nuestro encuentro  anual en la Nación
Sápara (en el Amazonas), con el fin de intercambiar saberes y aprender de
sus procesos comunitarios que han demostrado ser muy efectivos tanto en la
construcción de tejido social como en su interacción con el entorno.
 Nuestro propósito es integrar estos conocimientos con los del mundo
moderno para ofrecer herramientas de sensibilización y acción comunitaria en
Iberoamérica.</p>
<p>Así mismo queremos dar nuestro apoyo incondicional
a uno de nuestros líderes, Manari quien ha sido un estandarte de la cultura Sápara
y un activista incansable en la protección de la Amazonía.En el 2001 la Nación
Sápara fue declarada por la UNESCO como Patrimonio Inmaterial de la Humanidad. </p>
<p>Como dice Manari, “<i>en la nación Sápara hemos
desarrollado nuestro sistema de vida y reconocemos que todos los elementos que
conforman la naturaleza son seres vivos que tienen espíritus al igual que
nosotros. Es por ello que tenemos que ayudarnos los unos a los otros para
mantener el equilibrio de nuestras vidas y de la naturaleza</i>”</p>
<p>Por este motivo esta comunidad abrió las puertas de
su territorio para compartir con los visitantes sus conocimientos ancestrales,
costumbres, historias, alimentos y vivencias que solo pueden ser explicadas en
su real magnitud en medio del bosque.</p>

<p></p>
<h3><b>The requested support  </b></h3>
<p>To organize this meeting
with key leaders from our movement coming from Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Peru,
Argentina, Ecuador, Spain and the Muisca Nation, we need to raise US$10,000.
This money will cover the costs of transportation to the Amazon and compensate
the community for the accommodation and meals for our group during 5 days. Each
leader from Latin America and Spain will undertake the flight costs to Quito.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>El apoyo
que solicitamos</b></h3>
<p>Para realizar en este encuentro con líderes clave
de nuestro movimiento de México, Brasil, Colombia, Perú, Argentina, Ecuador,
España y la nación Muisca necesitamos recaudar  USD 10. 000. Este
dinero cubrirá los gastos de alquiler de avionetas para trasladarnos a la
Amazonía y remunerar a la comunidad Sapara por el hospedaje y alimentación de
nuestro grupo durante 5 días.  Cada uno de nosotros como líderes de la
región Iberoamericana nos hemos comprometido a asumir los gastos de avión a
Quito para iniciar desde allí la travesía. </p>
<h3><b>Objectives
of our meeting</b></h3>
<ul>
<li>Experiment and learn
     alongside the Sápara nation their ways of building community and interact
     effectively with their natural environment in order to weave in their
     wisdom to propose new alternatives of interaction in our communities.</li>
<li>Follow-up on our work
     and plan new actions to continue designing tools for raising awareness and

<h3>About the Pachamama Alliance</h3>
<p>The Pachamama Alliance is a nonprofit organization that was born out of a call from the Ecuadorian Amazon communities when they saw the threat that the current consumer society represents to the rainforest. For the past 20 years, this organization, has worked to empower the Amazonian communities to protect their culture and lands. Besides that, they have been working as well in sensitizing the western world promoting an environmentally sustainable, spiritually fulfilling and socially just human presence on this planet. The Pachamama Alliance develops its purpose through donations from people all around the world that are in alignment with this vision (<a href=""http://www.pachamama.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.pachamama.org</a>) </p>

</div></div>","Who are we

We are a group of volunteers concerned with
socio-environmental issues from Mexico, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil,
Argentina, Panama, Venezuela, Spain, and the Muisca and Sapara nations. Our group is engage with
the vision and work of the Pachamama Alliance in Latin America and Spain. We
have a common purpose: to generate an environmentally sustainable, spiritually
fulfilling and socially just human presence on this planet.  In this process, we focus on creating a
critical mass of conscious committed citizens that can generate a more positive
future. In our work we 
integrate the wisdom of the ancient people
with modern knowledge to support personal and group transformation.
For the past three years we
have met in different territories in order to create common strategies, share our
knowledge, learn together, make agreements and work on ourselves as human
beings. Our goal is to put all of this in the service of local communities and effectively
help to generate game changing actions.
This
year we have an ambitious plan: hold our annual meeting in the Sápara Indigenous
Nation (in the middle of the Amazon rainforest). We want to exchange knowledge
and learn from their community processes that have proven to be very effective
both in building social fabric as in their interaction with the natural world.
Our aim is to integrate this knowledge with the modern world to provide
sensitizing tools and actions that promote community development in the region
of Iberoamerica.  
We
also want to give our in conditional support to one of our leaders, Manari who
has been an example of the Sapara culture and a tireless activist in protecting
the Amazon rainforest. In 2001 the Sapara Nation was declared by the UNESCO as
Intangible Heritage of Humanity.
As
Manari says: “We Saparas have developed
our own system of living, recognizing that all of the elements that make up
nature are living beings which have spirits equal to us. So we all need to help
one another in order to maintain the equilibrium of our lives and of nature”
Therefore this community
opened the doors of its territory to share with visitors their ancestral
knowledge, customs, stories, food and experiences that can only be explain in its
real magnitude within the forest.
Quiénes
Somos
Somos un grupo de líderes voluntarios de México,
Perú, Ecuador, Colombia, Brasil, Argentina, Panamá, Venezuela, España y las naciones Muisca y
Sápara; dedicados a expandir la visión y el trabajo de la Alianza Pachamama en Latinoamérica
y España.   Tenemos un propósito común: generar una presencia humana en el
planeta, que sea ambientalmente sustentable, socialmente justa y
espiritualmente plena. En este proceso nos concentramos en generar una masa
crítica de ciudadanos conscientes que puedan generar un futuro más
positivo. En nuestro trabajo integramos la sabiduría de los pueblos
ancestrales con los conocimientos modernos para apoyar transformaciones
personales y grupales.
Desde hace tres años, realizamos encuentros en
diferentes territorios para generar estrategias conjuntas, compartir saberes,
tener aprendizajes colectivos, hacer acuerdos y trabajar en nuestro SER,
para poner todo esto al servicio de las comunidades locales en las que tenemos
injerencia y generar efectivamente acciones que cambien el juego.
Este año tenemos un plan ambicioso: Realizar
nuestro encuentro  anual en la Nación
Sápara (en el Amazonas), con el fin de intercambiar saberes y aprender de
sus procesos comunitarios que han demostrado ser muy efectivos tanto en la
construcción de tejido social como en su interacción con el entorno.
 Nuestro propósito es integrar estos conocimientos con los del mundo
moderno para ofrecer herramientas de sensibilización y acción comunitaria en
Iberoamérica.
Así mismo queremos dar nuestro apoyo incondicional
a uno de nuestros líderes, Manari quien ha sido un estandarte de la cultura Sápara
y un activista incansable en la protección de la Amazonía.En el 2001 la Nación
Sápara fue declarada por la UNESCO como Patrimonio Inmaterial de la Humanidad. 
Como dice Manari, “en la nación Sápara hemos
desarrollado nuestro sistema de vida y reconocemos que todos los elementos que
conforman la naturaleza son seres vivos que tienen espíritus al igual que
nosotros. Es por ello que tenemos que ayudarnos los unos a los otros para
mantener el equilibrio de nuestras vidas y de la naturaleza”
Por este motivo esta comunidad abrió las puertas de
su territorio para compartir con los visitantes sus conocimientos ancestrales,
costumbres, historias, alimentos y vivencias que solo pueden ser explicadas en
su real magnitud en medio del bosque.



 

The requested support  
To organize this meeting
with key leaders from our movement coming from Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Peru,
Argentina, Ecuador, Spain and the Muisca Nation, we need to raise US$10,000.

<p></p>
<p></p> <p>Most of the best inventions are borne of necessity. Some folks might not think having a popsicle or ice cold beer while enjoying a day out on the water is exactly a ""necessity,"" but after an hour or so under DC's brutal summer sun, it sure feels awfully close to it.</p>
<p>That's how Nauti Foods came about. A couple summers ago while out in their boat on the Potomac, Tammar Berger turned to her soon-to-be fiance, Ari Fingeroth, and exclaimed/questioned, ""All I want is a popsicle.

Why wasn't there anything equivalent to a food truck on the Potomac--or anywhere else, for that matter? With that one question, began Ari's mission to make that happen (because that's what good guys do for the women they love).  By mid-summer the following year, after jumping through all kinds of regulatory hoops and securing all the proper permits, Nauti Foods and DC's very first aquatic food truck, the Nauti Boat, were born.</p>

<p>Ari and Tammar are two DC-transplants who fell in love with the Stars and Bars (and each other) and never looked back. </p>
<p>Originally from New Hampshire, where he grew up spending summer days and nights in his family's cabin on a lake, Ari's long held a love and deepest respect for the water and nature. When he moved to DC for a job in Building, he nearly packed up and left town when summer hit, till he learned about the wealth of water-based activities to be had on the Potomac. Over time, he got his own boat--and built his own small, local firm, Federalist Builders, dedicated to excellence in craftsmanship, and committed to Green Building initiatives as well as giving back to the community through its Federalist Fund.</p>
<p>Tammar grew up in Canada, not on a lake, but surrounded by nature, which early on instilled a deep love for the  outdoors and commitment to leading an active, healthy lifestyle. Now a lawyer with the World Bank, her passion for fitness and cycling--as well as desire to help her DC friends and neighbors pursue healthy lifestyles--led her to partnering with a friend to form Off Road Indoor Cycling nearly 3 years ago. Off Road Indoor Cycling was just named Washington City Paper's 2015 Best Indoor Cycling Studio, and is known for not only its excellent, creative. fun classes, but for serving the community and supporting causes with their ""Gives Back"" Program. It also happens to be the place where Ari and Tammar first met.</p>
<p>They're set to get married this fall.</p>

<p><b>Meet Nauti </b><br/></p>
<p>Nauti Foods is the parent company of the Nauti Boat. The Nauti Boat is a reconfigured 1984 Pontoon Boat that's licensed and permitted to serve just like a food truck, but on the water--and serve beer. The Nauti Boat will carry and serve a rotating variety of local foods and beverages from some of DC's favorite local restaurants, including Bullfrog Bagels and Atlas Brew Works throughout the summer, every weekend, with some bonus days scattered throughout.<br/><br/>In addition to offering local products, Nauti Foods offers a small-but-growing selection of food products proprietary to the Nauti Boat, including:</p>
<p><b><i>Nauti Dog:</i></b> Fresh-off-the-grill Corkscrew-Cut Jumbo Hebrew National Hot Dog</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431226354/nyefcrw9zvrfymsrcsuy.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 555.062913907285px; height: 311px;""/><br/><b><i><br/>Nauti Monkey:</i></b> Freshly made Chocolate-Covered Frozen Banana<br/><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">What Nauti Boat Needs</span><br/></p>
</div><div> <p></p>
<p>Last year's Nauti Boat essentially served as the prototype, the first of its kind in more way than one. The 1984 24ft Pontoon Boat was fully functional, but all the parts need upgrading.</p>
<p><b>Motor $10K -</b> The current motor is still the original 1984 engine. The likelihood of it starting is increasingly iffy, taking several turns to actually start. One day soon, it won't. It's also not an efficient motor and not environmentally sound.<br/>It absolutely needs to be replaced this season. The desired motor is quieter, safer, more efficient and will definitely start.</p>
<p><b>Generator $2K - </b>The generator is essential to keeping food fresh &amp; safe, ice cream and popsicles frozen, and beers cold. Knowing that generators could be extremely loud and inefficient, Ari modified the one they purchased, adding on a muffler and other features to reduce noise and boost efficiency. Unfortunately, those modifications weren't enough to keep it from being disruptively loud. The new TriFuel Generator will reduce noise by 50% and use energy far more efficiently--making for a better experience for fellow boaters and paddlers as well as the environment.</p>
<p><b>Refrigerator $2K -</b> Last year, since cost was a huge concern, Ari and Tammar purchased a top-loading freezer (which is a whole lot cheaper than a refrigerator) and modified it to work as a refrigerator...kind of. Items on the side of the freezer continued to freeze--cans burst,  product was lost. This year they're looking to purchase a true refrigerator that keeps products at opti<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">mum temperature, with glass doors to best display and promote product.</span></p>
<p><b>Tap System $2K</b> - Through Ari's sheer persistence, Nauti Foods secured a liquor license to serve beer and wine off the Naut Boat this summer. He and Tammar have already formed friendships and partnerships with local craft beer companies and non-alcoholic beverage providers (G by Mike Isabella's kegged lemonade) for the Nauti Boat to serve ice cold drinks from the tap. But to make those ice-cold drinks happen a tap system needs to be installed. Ari's designed a proprietary tow-behind keg system--now he just need to the funds to make it a reality. </p>
<p><b>Docking/Storage Fees $3K</b> - Everyone knows that having a boat's not cheap. Ari's gone out of his way to secure docking and storage that's affordable, but without seed money, even the cheapest rates sting.</p>
<p><span><b>Technology (for inventory, tracking, payments) $2K - </b>Bringing refreshments for sale out on the water comes with some unique business challenges. Two of the big ones being helping people find you, and then once they do, making sure they have a way to pay you. (Not many folks bring money out with them on their paddleboard.) Both of these things are easily solved through technological solutions, like Square (pay with Square) and Paypal, among others. Tracking devices can also be employed to make it easy for potential customers to find Nauti on the water, where the streets have no name.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Marketing/PR $3K<br/><b>Photography/Videography $4K</b><br/><b>Social Media $3K<br/></b></b></span><b>Partnership development $2K</b><br/>What good is a business if no one knows about it? Getting Nauti properly launched into a marketplace that's never seen anything like it, and helping Nauti grow and develop into other locations and cities, is going to take a whole lot of work from friends who specialize in these things. </p>
<p><b>Vision and Expansion</b><br/>Any and all funds raised beyond the initial $30K goal would be directly applied to research and development for bringing Nauti Foods' Nauti Boat to other areas on DC's urban waterways, DelMarVa, and popular boating spots beyond--from Nauti Chesapeake, to Nauti Austin, Nauti Boston, Nauti Outerbanks, and more! The potential to enhance the experience out on the water across the nation is limitless.</p>

Tammar grew up in Canada, not on a lake, but surrounded by nature, which early on instilled a deep love for the  outdoors and commitment to leading an active, healthy lifestyle. Now a lawyer with the World Bank, her passion for fitness and cycling--as well as desire to help her DC friends and neighbors pursue healthy lifestyles--led her to partnering with a friend to form Off Road Indoor Cycling nearly 3 years ago. Off Road Indoor Cycling was just named Washington City Paper's 2015 Best Indoor Cycling Studio, and is known for not only its excellent, creative. fun classes, but for serving the community and supporting causes with their ""Gives Back"" Program. It also happens to be the place where Ari and Tammar first met.
They're set to get married this fall.


Meet Nauti 
Nauti Foods is the parent company of the Nauti Boat. The Nauti Boat is a reconfigured 1984 Pontoon Boat that's licensed and permitted to serve just like a food truck, but on the water--and serve beer. The Nauti Boat will carry and serve a rotating variety of local foods and beverages from some of DC's favorite local restaurants, including Bullfrog Bagels and Atlas Brew Works throughout the summer, every weekend, with some bonus days scattered throughout.In addition to offering local products, Nauti Foods offers a small-but-growing selection of food products proprietary to the Nauti Boat, including:
Nauti Dog: Fresh-off-the-grill Corkscrew-Cut Jumbo Hebrew National Hot Dog
Nauti Monkey: Freshly made Chocolate-Covered Frozen Banana
What Nauti Boat Needs
 
Last year's Nauti Boat essentially served as the prototype, the first of its kind in more way than one. The 1984 24ft Pontoon Boat was fully functional, but all the parts need upgrading.
Motor $10K - The current motor is still the original 1984 engine. The likelihood of it starting is increasingly iffy, taking several turns to actually start. One day soon, it won't. It's also not an efficient motor and not environmentally sound.It absolutely needs to be replaced this season. The desired motor is quieter, safer, more efficient and will definitely start.
Generator $2K - The generator is essential to keeping food fresh & safe, ice cream and popsicles frozen, and beers cold. Knowing that generators could be extremely loud and inefficient, Ari modified the one they purchased, adding on a muffler and other features to reduce noise and boost efficiency. Unfortunately, those modifications weren't enough to keep it from being disruptively loud. The new TriFuel Generator will reduce noise by 50% and use energy far more efficiently--making for a better experience for fellow boaters and paddlers as well as the environment.
Refrigerator $2K - Last year, since cost was a huge concern, Ari and Tammar purchased a top-loading freezer (which is a whole lot cheaper than a refrigerator) and modified it to work as a refrigerator...kind of. Items on the side of the freezer continued to freeze--cans burst,  product was lost. This year they're looking to purchase a true refrigerator that keeps products at optimum temperature, with glass doors to best display and promote product.
Tap System $2K - Through Ari's sheer persistence, Nauti Foods secured a liquor license to serve beer and wine off the Naut Boat this summer. He and Tammar have already formed friendships and partnerships with local craft beer companies and non-alcoholic beverage providers (G by Mike Isabella's kegged lemonade) for the Nauti Boat to serve ice cold drinks from the tap. But to make those ice-cold drinks happen a tap system needs to be installed. Ari's designed a proprietary tow-behind keg system--now he just need to the funds to make it a reality. 
Docking/Storage Fees $3K - Everyone knows that having a boat's not cheap. Ari's gone out of his way to secure docking and storage that's affordable, but without seed money, even the cheapest rates sting.
Technology (for inventory, tracking, payments) $2K - Bringing refreshments for sale out on the water comes with some unique business challenges. Two of the big ones being helping people find you, and then once they do, making sure they have a way to pay you. (Not many folks bring money out with them on their paddleboard.) Both of these things are easily solved through technological solutions, like Square (pay with Square) and Paypal, among others. Tracking devices can also be employed to make it easy for potential customers to find Nauti on the water, where the streets have no name.
Marketing/PR $3KPhotography/Videography $4KSocial Media $3KPartnership development $2KWhat good is a business if no one knows about it? Getting Nauti properly launched into a marketplace that's never seen anything like it, and helping Nauti grow and develop into other locations and cities, is going to take a whole lot of work from friends who specialize in these things. 
Vision and ExpansionAny and all funds raised beyond the initial $30K goal would be directly applied to research and development for bringing Nauti Foods' Nauti Boat to other areas on DC's urban waterways, DelMarVa, and popular boating spots beyond--from Nauti Chesapeake, to Nauti Austin, Nauti Boston, Nauti Outerbanks, and more! The potential to enhance the experience out on the water across the nation is limitless.
Help us make this dream a reality!

<b><h3>
<br/>Kurzbeschreibung</h3>This is a socially conscious brand, made for all dreamers, free 
spirits, bohemian hearts and gypsy souls. It directly connects you to 
impact the community positively.</b><p>I've always been kind of a 
hippie at heart. I love being barefoot in dresses, wearing frayed jeans 
with holes, fringe bags and friendship bracelets and having long wavy 
hair. I adore incense, burning oils, dreamcatchers, a lot of plants in 
my room, lying in hammocks, going on road trips and festivals and I've 
always been wondering about people who worry too much about their lives.
 I love the way of thinking that you can achieve anything you want in 
your life, if you just want it enough and if you already feel how you 
will feel, when you've achieved it...<br/><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434060952/pbzpy8g2juq0ouuegoft.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Sometimes you need a little help by others and that's why I am here.<br/>As
 a fashion, jewelry and decoration enthusiast I've always had the dream 
to own a store and thus offer beautiful things to other people. Over the
 last year, I've had a hard pathway as a self-taught entrepreneur, 
jewelry manufacturer and on finding the right suppliers for my project. 
I've had to teach myself every inch of this business, get my hands 
dirty, work tiressly without days off, study, apply, fail and succeed!
I am now equipped to handle any risk or challenge, because problem 
solving has become a facility for me.<br/><br/>As you could read in the 
short description of this project, you will help creating jobs by 
supporting this. Of course I will not be able to have 10 employees right
 from the start, but who knows.. Everybody always tells ""Think big!"", so
 maybe someday there will be more 'Boho Child' stores and thus more jobs
 you've created!
<br/><br/><b>Why will the store have another name than the online store?</b><br/>For the online store I was searching for a name, which is short and easy to remember. 'Redamo' is latin and means ""I love (you) again"". I still like this name a lot but for the local store I was searching for a name, which directly lets you know, that the products offered there are all about the boho look.<br/>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Was du uns gibst &amp; was du bekommst Kurzbeschreibung<br/>
</h3>
<p>If the project gets funded 4-9% go to Indiegogo and additionally 3-5% for the transactions.
<br/>Almost half of the amount, which is left then, will be spend on the rewards and for shipment.</p>
<p>The rents for shops in the city I live are very high. I will also 
have to pay rent deposit (2,26 x monthly rent) plus broker's commission.
 Then the store needs interior like shelves, security system and 
mannequins. The money, which is left then, would be spend on purchasing

<p>The second thing I really want to do is supporting charity organizations.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>I've
 made some mistakes and bad experiences in my life just like everybody 
else. I've had bad jobs with weird, selfish bosses, have worked for them
 on some days for 11 hours while not having a break during this time and
 I've had financial straits after some decisions, too. But I don't 
regret any of those decisions and mistakes and I am not sad about those 
experiences. <br/>You want to know why? Once I've read somewhere a really mind changing thing, I want to share with you:<br/>1. Think of the 5 worst experiences in your life...
<br/>2. Then reflect if they've also had any positive impacts, that maybe changed your life completely. <br/>- You will find them! <br/><br/>So
 I guess, everything that happened in my past, should have happened, so 
that I now can be here at this point in my life with all of my positive 
thoughts and energy to start something and to be my own boss. Yes, maybe
 from now on I will work on many days for 11 hours without a break. But 
then it's my decision and I will do it with a pleasure to reach my goal 
to help others, too.
</p>
<p>
The moment, when I got a positive reinforcement for my plan:
</p>
<p>For sure you know those people, mostly seen in city centers, who 
want to get your aid for known charity organizations. Once a young guy 
talked to me about one organization and asked me to join it but 
unfortunately this happened at a point in my life I really couldn't, 
because I was at the absolutely top of my financial straits. And this 
was the moment I promised myself to do it as soon as I am able to!
So I will donate a part of my future sales for helping other people, who
 are in those situations and don't have the possibility to get out of 
it.<br/><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risiken &amp; Herausforderungen</h3>
<p>Every project faces potential setbacks. However, due to my longtime 
experiences in retail, my pathway to a self-taught entrepreneur and my 
extensive research for the best suppliers, my positive mind and strength
 of purpose, I feel very confident about my ability to built up an 
amazing store. I will continue to work directly with my suppliers to 
ensure quality.</p>
<p>If we manage to easily exceed the goal, it could be a small challenge
 to make all of the parcels ready and built up a store almost at the 
same time, but this would also be a great 'problem' to tackle ;) . I 
promise everyone will get their rewards on time and it would be a 
pleasure for me to send you some love of 'Boho Child' with it.</p>
<p>I will make sure to stay in contact to you guys during the whole 
project. If you have any questions, I would be happy to talk to you.
<br/>Thank you so much for your support.<br/><br/></p>

</div></div>","KurzbeschreibungThis is a socially conscious brand, made for all dreamers, free 
spirits, bohemian hearts and gypsy souls. It directly connects you to 
impact the community positively.I've always been kind of a 
hippie at heart. I love being barefoot in dresses, wearing frayed jeans 
with holes, fringe bags and friendship bracelets and having long wavy 
hair. I adore incense, burning oils, dreamcatchers, a lot of plants in 
my room, lying in hammocks, going on road trips and festivals and I've 
always been wondering about people who worry too much about their lives.
 I love the way of thinking that you can achieve anything you want in 
your life, if you just want it enough and if you already feel how you 
will feel, when you've achieved it...
Sometimes you need a little help by others and that's why I am here.As
 a fashion, jewelry and decoration enthusiast I've always had the dream 
to own a store and thus offer beautiful things to other people. Over the
 last year, I've had a hard pathway as a self-taught entrepreneur, 
jewelry manufacturer and on finding the right suppliers for my project. 
I've had to teach myself every inch of this business, get my hands 
dirty, work tiressly without days off, study, apply, fail and succeed!
I am now equipped to handle any risk or challenge, because problem 
solving has become a facility for me.As you could read in the 
short description of this project, you will help creating jobs by 
supporting this. Of course I will not be able to have 10 employees right
 from the start, but who knows.. Everybody always tells ""Think big!"", so
 maybe someday there will be more 'Boho Child' stores and thus more jobs
 you've created!
Why will the store have another name than the online store?For the online store I was searching for a name, which is short and easy to remember. 'Redamo' is latin and means ""I love (you) again"". I still like this name a lot but for the local store I was searching for a name, which directly lets you know, that the products offered there are all about the boho look.

  Was du uns gibst & was du bekommst Kurzbeschreibung

If the project gets funded 4-9% go to Indiegogo and additionally 3-5% for the transactions.
Almost half of the amount, which is left then, will be spend on the rewards and for shipment.
The rents for shops in the city I live are very high. I will also 
have to pay rent deposit (2,26 x monthly rent) plus broker's commission.
 Then the store needs interior like shelves, security system and 
mannequins. The money, which is left then, would be spend on purchasing 
the proudcts, which would be offered in the shop.I have put together a list of very exciting perks for my contributors. There are numerous discount code options for anyone who might like to do a
 bit of shopping in the online store. Some perks are also products from the online store, but you will get them way cheaper here. Don't forget, all perks have free shipment, too.Any funds we raise via this campaign will go towards this store project, so even if we do not reach our goal of 25.000 €, I won't give up on my dream and I will find any other way to open this store.

</div><p>Hi. I am Ian Blake and
I am a teacher, a scientist and I am passionate about food and what it means to
our bodies and our environment. Some might even call me a nerd. Ok, they do
call me a nerd. More specifically the “Garden Geek”.</p>
<p>Which is why I am
embracing my inner gardening geek and starting a sustainable farm: Eudaimonia
Farms. Why Eudaimonia? It is a Greek word translated as happiness or “human
flourishing”, and that is exactly what I aim to create. Food that helps humans to
flourish. </p>
<p>But this is not just
another farm. Oh no, this is a farm of the future. Why? We will be setting up
stands at local Farmer’s Markets to offer communities healthier, less expensive
greens on a consistent basis. As we grow, so will our outreach and ability to
feed the future. </p>
<p>Right now, people are connected
to everything, but their food; we have no idea from where that food comes. Let’s
change that. </p>
<p>I want people to eat
good, affordable, local food. You probably already know (or it makes sense
that) local food tastes better…it doesn’t have to travel very far to get on
your table, therefore it’s usually fresher. That means your food is healthier
and, bonus, it costs less</p>
<p>However, that is just
the beginning of why buying locally is better. </p>
<p>There are 3 major
reasons why local is better…</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Economic Health -</p>
<p>    o Keeps money in the community</p><p>
    o Helps the local

<p>·<span> 
</span>Environmental Health -</p>
<p>    o Reducing
the supply chain (reduces energy costs)</p>
<p>    o Reducing
the carbon footprint on the food that you eat</p>
<p>    o Growing
organically will not release pesticides into the environment or drinking           water
(nor does it have fertilizer runoff)</p>

<p>    o Healthy food is good</p>
<p>    o Tasty food is better</p>

<p><b>What We Need &amp;
What You Get</b></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>At the $15,000 mark I
can break ground and begin construction for Eudaimonia Farms. More allows for
greater autonomy and more time to perfect the systems.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Every dollar, even if
we don't reach our goal, will go towards building the farm. I've dealt with
life's hurtles before and can jump and sprint with the best of them.</p>

throughout all Eudaimonia Farms promotions.</p>

<h1>Help Hunger Action Los Angeles (HALA) expand Farmers Markets' Market Match Program in LA County</h1>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>Who We Are and How Market Match Works</b></h3>
<p>Hi I'm Frank Tamborello and I'm one of a team of people in Los Angeles who believe that eating healthy should not just be for the wealthy! Hunger isn't just about having enough food, it’s about having access to enough healthy food.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After looking into programs in other parts of the country that doubled the money of people using CalFresh (what we used to call Food Stamps) at farmers markets, we began raising money for a program that farmers coming to Los Angeles could benefit from while offering more food to those who needed it. </p>
<p>Many low-income families can't afford the basic fruits and vegetables needed to be healthy, that’s why diabetes and obesity are two of the worst diseases facing our country today. It's not the amount, but the poor quality of food that leads to poor health.<br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439247078/f919rert9grzu5az4iki.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p>Today our Market Match Program allows low-income families using food stamps to get up to $10 in vouchers extra per week to spend on fresh fruits and vegetables at farmers markets–amounting up to $50 a month! We expanded to other low-income populations as well, especially seniors getting Supplemental Security Income pensions. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439332078/zdc8wahq0gqz1suac8ol.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>When a customer comes to the market with only $5 dollars in cash or EBT, we can match that amount to $10 dollars using Market Match vouchers. They can then use the vouchers to buy twice as many fruits and vegetables.</b> This creates a higher demand for healthy foods to be sold at farmers markets, keeps low-income families and seniors healthy while helping small farmers sell more produce.<br/></p>
<p>Without the use of pesticides or chemical fertilizers, thousands of small farmers are growing nutritious food and keeping our environment healthy as well. They sell their bounty weekly at farmers markets all over Southern California—120 markets in LA County alone!</p>
<p></p>
<p>But when you say “farmers market” people think of overpriced items that are nutritious but could not fit into the budget of a mom working part-time to raise three kids, a person with disabilities living on a monthly benefit or a senior struggling to pay their rent. </p>
<p>California should not have this problem. We're growing over half of the nation’s fruits and vegetables! </p>
<p>Here in Southern California we've grown from one market in LA to a total of 16 with our colleagues doing the program at 5 others in LA, and a total of 230 markets around the state!</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 38px; background-color: initial;"">The Recession and the Affordable Healthy Food movement: Market Match.</span><br/></p>
</div><div>
<p>Several years ago a group of concerned residents formed Hunger Action LA to address issues of both hunger and healthy eating.<b> The 2008 recession resulted in Food Stamp use being doubled all over the USA.</b> Los Angeles' large population of struggling working families, the unemployed and seniors trying to make it on small pensions needed access to healthier, more affordable food. We knew there must be a way to help farmers grow more healthy foods low-income families could afford.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439414385/srscjvgsxcgcfd4llnnv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Farmers markets in California originally begun (after a campaign to establish them as legal)  in the 1970s, as a way to help small farmers sell goods in low-income areas that needed more organic fruits and vegetables. Unfortunately, over the years they had a reputation of being places where only people who could afford luxurious food items could shop. But kale, collard greens, white radishes, tomatoes, and avocados aren't just for the wealthy! <b>Every person should have access to healthy foods regardless of their income, and Market Match levels the playing field.</b></p>
<h2>But We Still Need Your Help.</h2>
<p>This is a critical time. We need to spread Market Match to all corners of Los Angeles county and attract the support needed to make it a permanent and sustainable program.<br/></p>
<p>People are flocking to the markets for healthy food that won't break their budget, but we still don't have enough resources to meet the rising demand at the markets—as a result we're forced to limit the number of vouchers we distribute.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439413957/lhmhry6khit130wakalh.jpg"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""/></p>
<p>We need to raise more funds to meet the needs of the senior and disabled population. We also have new funding sources, but unfortunately we can't access them until we advance money to the markets. Finally, we want to increase the amount we distribute at existing markets and especially to add markets in Los Angeles. </p>

<h3><b>A contribution with results you can see</b></h3>
<p>This program will inspire people in our market areas because those who have to watch where every penny goes will be getting twice as much for their money at their local farmers market. And remember, every dollar does two things: it helps a low-income family eat better AND helps a farmer bring more of the good stuff.</p>
<p><b>Hunger Action LA has successfully begun Market Match at 16 farmers markets in LA County since 2010. </b>We've done it <u>methodically</u> and <u>responsibly</u> on a limited basis when finances made that necessary. Making sure that we had capacity and volunteers to make the program run well, dealing with problems as we went along and building a strong coalition among the market operators who run the farmers markets.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439413733/eyynfggiclomkxecn9vl.jpg"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""/></p>
<p><b>We've partnered with numerous organizations</b> and have attracted funding from <u>First 5 LA</u> and from the <u>US Department of Agriculture </u>through the <u>Ecology Center, </u>an organization working to build Market Match across the state. But we cannot and should not rely on large funders alone. We want a sustainable program that belongs to the people of LA County.</p>
<p></p>

<p>This program is built from the ground up by ordinary people pioneering a new and exciting approach to four things:  fighting poverty, improving public health, supporting California’s great asset of small acre farms and in so doing, promoting environmentally sustainable farming methods. That’s why we call Market Match a Four-Way Win-Win-Win-Win!</p>
<h3><b>The Challenge—And The Vision</b></h3>
<p>Raising money for this program isn't easy–a lot is needed for us to meet the demand here in LA., but many people share our dream and it’s not impossible! Michigan has implemented a program just like this statewide. If Michigan can do it why can't California? You can be an important part of making the dream really come true!</p>

</div></div>","Help Hunger Action Los Angeles (HALA) expand Farmers Markets' Market Match Program in LA County



Who We Are and How Market Match Works
Hi I'm Frank Tamborello and I'm one of a team of people in Los Angeles who believe that eating healthy should not just be for the wealthy! Hunger isn't just about having enough food, it’s about having access to enough healthy food.

After looking into programs in other parts of the country that doubled the money of people using CalFresh (what we used to call Food Stamps) at farmers markets, we began raising money for a program that farmers coming to Los Angeles could benefit from while offering more food to those who needed it. 
Many low-income families can't afford the basic fruits and vegetables needed to be healthy, that’s why diabetes and obesity are two of the worst diseases facing our country today. It's not the amount, but the poor quality of food that leads to poor health.

Today our Market Match Program allows low-income families using food stamps to get up to $10 in vouchers extra per week to spend on fresh fruits and vegetables at farmers markets–amounting up to $50 a month! We expanded to other low-income populations as well, especially seniors getting Supplemental Security Income pensions. 


When a customer comes to the market with only $5 dollars in cash or EBT, we can match that amount to $10 dollars using Market Match vouchers. They can then use the vouchers to buy twice as many fruits and vegetables. This creates a higher demand for healthy foods to be sold at farmers markets, keeps low-income families and seniors healthy while helping small farmers sell more produce.
Without the use of pesticides or chemical fertilizers, thousands of small farmers are growing nutritious food and keeping our environment healthy as well. They sell their bounty weekly at farmers markets all over Southern California—120 markets in LA County alone!

But when you say “farmers market” people think of overpriced items that are nutritious but could not fit into the budget of a mom working part-time to raise three kids, a person with disabilities living on a monthly benefit or a senior struggling to pay their rent. 
California should not have this problem. We're growing over half of the nation’s fruits and vegetables! 
Here in Southern California we've grown from one market in LA to a total of 16 with our colleagues doing the program at 5 others in LA, and a total of 230 markets around the state!
The Recession and the Affordable Healthy Food movement: Market Match.

Several years ago a group of concerned residents formed Hunger Action LA to address issues of both hunger and healthy eating. The 2008 recession resulted in Food Stamp use being doubled all over the USA. Los Angeles' large population of struggling working families, the unemployed and seniors trying to make it on small pensions needed access to healthier, more affordable food. We knew there must be a way to help farmers grow more healthy foods low-income families could afford.


Farmers markets in California originally begun (after a campaign to establish them as legal)  in the 1970s, as a way to help small farmers sell goods in low-income areas that needed more organic fruits and vegetables. Unfortunately, over the years they had a reputation of being places where only people who could afford luxurious food items could shop. But kale, collard greens, white radishes, tomatoes, and avocados aren't just for the wealthy! Every person should have access to healthy foods regardless of their income, and Market Match levels the playing field.
But We Still Need Your Help.
This is a critical time. We need to spread Market Match to all corners of Los Angeles county and attract the support needed to make it a permanent and sustainable program.
People are flocking to the markets for healthy food that won't break their budget, but we still don't have enough resources to meet the rising demand at the markets—as a result we're forced to limit the number of vouchers we distribute.
We need to raise more funds to meet the needs of the senior and disabled population. We also have new funding sources, but unfortunately we can't access them until we advance money to the markets. Finally, we want to increase the amount we distribute at existing markets and especially to add markets in Los Angeles. 

$15,000 will Launch Market Match Programs in

Compton

Downtown L.A. (The lively and hip 5th & Spring location, also home to many seniors and people with disabilities)
Eagle Rock
Pasadena
Santa Fe Springs
 By making a donation you'll be helping our small California farmers, many having to cut production due to the drought. Unless they get more income on a regular basis, they won't be able to afford to keep driving to L.A. to sell at the markets. We could see a loss of environmentally sustainable farming and a loss of affordable farmers markets in our urban areas. Help thousands of families, seniors and people with disabilities get a dignified healthy diet that will help the farmers now struggling with the drought who are bringing this great food into Los Angeles.



You can be part of this program and get the recognition you deserve for making L.A. healthy and hunger-free while giving California’s farmers the boost they need!
Come out to a Market Match site and see for yourself! Take a glance at the LA Times article from the Saturday, July 25 print edition. With your help, we can make EVERY farmers market look like Adams/Vermont!

The Perks of Being a Contributor
We have a lot of great perks for you if you can contribute!
—If you or your group can raise $1,000 we will acknowledge you at the market of your choice with a full-length banner on one particular market day. We want everyone to know that YOU made it happen.

—If you or your group can raise $250 or more you have the option of free rental for any occasion you wish of our custom built Smoothie Bike, pedaled by hundreds of kids (and many a parent too) in nutrition education presentations we've done at the markets
—If you are interested in learning more about the fight against hunger, for a $20 contribution you'll receive Joel Berg's book ""All You Can Eat: How Hungry Is America?"", which will give you some of the real reasons we have hunger in such a wealthy country. Joel is director of the New York City Coalition Against Hunger and former Clinton administration official who pulls no punches in this excellent book.
—For a $40 contribution you will receive: The intersection between art and hunger, a DVD of author/playwright Dan Froot's innovative tabletop theater piece ""Who's Hungry?"". Dan translates the true stories of people who have experienced hunger in modern America into miniature dramas using small puppetlike figures. A truly unique art form. Plus a copy of Joel Berg's book ""All You Can Eat: How Hungry is America? Described above.
—Oh yes, show people what your support with pride! We have T-shirts, tote bags, water bottles and flash drives. All items sport the Hunger Action Los Angeles Logo–make it memorable! Help us spread the word!
If we don't reach our entire goal, the funds will go to one of the four potential sites listed above. 
A contribution with results you can see
This program will inspire people in our market areas because those who have to watch where every penny goes will be getting twice as much for their money at their local farmers market. And remember, every dollar does two things: it helps a low-income family eat better AND helps a farmer bring more of the good stuff.
Hunger Action LA has successfully begun Market Match at 16 farmers markets in LA County since 2010. We've done it methodically and responsibly on a limited basis when finances made that necessary. Making sure that we had capacity and volunteers to make the program run well, dealing with problems as we went along and building a strong coalition among the market operators who run the farmers markets.
We've partnered with numerous organizations and have attracted funding from First 5 LA and from the US Department of Agriculture through the Ecology Center, an organization working to build Market Match across the state. But we cannot and should not rely on large funders alone. We want a sustainable program that belongs to the people of LA County.


This program is built from the ground up by ordinary people pioneering a new and exciting approach to four things:  fighting poverty, improving public health, supporting California’s great asset of small acre farms and in so doing, promoting environmentally sustainable farming methods. That’s why we call Market Match a Four-Way Win-Win-Win-Win!
The Challenge—And The Vision
Raising money for this program isn't easy–a lot is needed for us to meet the demand here in LA., but many people share our dream and it’s not impossible! Michigan has implemented a program just like this statewide. If Michigan can do it why can't California? You can be an important part of making the dream really come true!
Hey, money's tight—we know
Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:
If you can't contribute, you can still help! Get the word out and MAKE SOME NOISE about our campaign. Share the LA Times article and spread the email out to your friends & social networks. And let us know if you'd like to volunteer distributing Market Match at one of the participating markets!

We are entering the second phase of our plan for the shop. This includes upgrades to how the store looks, our inventory we carry, and even adding logos to our shop van!<br/><br/>We are mostly a self funded business with a large majority of the stores profits going right back into the store for improvements. This fundraiser is to help speed up the process of improving the store and making it a better place for our customers and a stand out in our field.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need<br/>
</h3>This is the breakdown of the funds we are seeking and where they will go. We are asking for $6,000 overall.<br/><br/>$4,000 of this is going towards a massive renovation to make room for 10,000+ comic books. This will include new custom shelving to hold the comics, display stands, and wall shelving to hold comic books, manga, and graphic novels. This will make Flashbax one of the largest comic book dealers in the region.<br/><br/>$1,500 will go towards a side fund to get a full Diamond account for 
Flashbax. This will bring in new comic books, collectibles, and more 
into our inventory and allow customers a closer place to buy comic books
 and related goods. This fund will go towards 3 months worth of orders.<br/><br/>$350 or so will go towards adding official shop logos onto the side and tailgate of the shop van. This van (named Kiora by the shop fans) will become a regular sight at the conventions and with the shop logos it will stand out in a crowd.<br/><br/>$500 (tentative goal) If we raise more than expected we will allocate roughly $500 in putting a full decal of the MTG Kiora, The Crashing Wave artwork on the hood of the van. This will make the van stand out even more and draw attention to the store and should help advertisement a lot as it will be sitting outside wherever we are vending.<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>This will further the success we have seen for our small shop. As word spreads, Flashbax is slowly becoming a name people recognize and trust. Our goal at Flashbax is for everyone to have a great experience in our store, find something they love, and introduce people to a new hobby.<br/><br/>We are a safe location for people of all backgrounds, races, religions, and hobbies to come, have fun, and meet like minded people. We have seen new friendships forged, games played, and people finding that one items they miss from their childhood.<br/><br/>These upgrades to Flashbax will make it a stronger addition to the Aberdeen community and also a stronger business overall. We area member of the Downtown Association here in Aberdeen and as we grow, we can be a voice for smaller businesses in our area as well as a voice for our customer base.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>The risks are low but the challenges are high. If we do not meet the main goal of $6,000, we will have to assess the money we do get. The first and major goal will be the purchase of the comic book collection. This is a key piece missing in our store and will solidify our footing as a true comic book shop (for back issues). <br/><br/>The logos on the van are also a high end priority as we will use this van day in and day out 365 days a year. People seeing this van, with the logo, will peak their interest and draw them to the store. <br/><br/>Without a Diamond account we can not order newer comics. I myself (Erik Braley) have experience with working with Diamond and more so know my customers. I will bring a fun array of comics to our shelves and I hope to create a good repeat customer base with this account. Without it, each month I have to redirect people to other sources. Your help will keep the money local and create a new crowd of comic fans and collectors in our community.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>I know not every one can donate. Time are still rough all around. You can still help! Spread the word about Flashbax, share this campaign to friends or family that might want to help. Know someone with an interest in helping a small business? Point them our way!<br/><br/>Everything helps in the end and we love you guys for a great year so far! <br/>

This van (named Kiora by the shop fans) will become a regular sight at the conventions and with the shop logos it will stand out in a crowd.$500 (tentative goal) If we raise more than expected we will allocate roughly $500 in putting a full decal of the MTG Kiora, The Crashing Wave artwork on the hood of the van. This will make the van stand out even more and draw attention to the store and should help advertisement a lot as it will be sitting outside wherever we are vending.
  The ImpactThis will further the success we have seen for our small shop. As word spreads, Flashbax is slowly becoming a name people recognize and trust. Our goal at Flashbax is for everyone to have a great experience in our store, find something they love, and introduce people to a new hobby.We are a safe location for people of all backgrounds, races, religions, and hobbies to come, have fun, and meet like minded people. We have seen new friendships forged, games played, and people finding that one items they miss from their childhood.These upgrades to Flashbax will make it a stronger addition to the Aberdeen community and also a stronger business overall. We area member of the Downtown Association here in Aberdeen and as we grow, we can be a voice for smaller businesses in our area as well as a voice for our customer base.
  Risks & ChallengesThe risks are low but the challenges are high. If we do not meet the main goal of $6,000, we will have to assess the money we do get. The first and major goal will be the purchase of the comic book collection. This is a key piece missing in our store and will solidify our footing as a true comic book shop (for back issues). The logos on the van are also a high end priority as we will use this van day in and day out 365 days a year. People seeing this van, with the logo, will peak their interest and draw them to the store. Without a Diamond account we can not order newer comics. I myself (Erik Braley) have experience with working with Diamond and more so know my customers. I will bring a fun array of comics to our shelves and I hope to create a good repeat customer base with this account. Without it, each month I have to redirect people to other sources. Your help will keep the money local and create a new crowd of comic fans and collectors in our community.

<h3>Be in control - without restricting theme</h3>
<p>
            With most other website builders you are forced to select a theme for your website before you begin creating it. Usually it is easy to find a nice looking theme, but themes are not unique and very hard to modify.
        </p>
<p>
            We believe creatives need liberty. Your personal website must be truly unique. A digital portfolio reflecting who you are. Therefor, with Portfoliobox you are never restricted by an overall theme that limits your design. You are free to use any template on any page and you can combine pages as you wish, the number of combinations are infinite.
        </p>

<h3>Super fast - thanks to the latest technologies</h3>
<p>
            The website that you build with Portfoliobox 3 will look like a normal website, but it will be quick as an app. Portfoliobox is built with the latest web technologies and that will make your website incredible fast.

</div></div>","Introducing Portfoliobox 3
Portfoliobox 3 is a web tool you can use to create your own unique website.
This brand new version of Portfoliobox utilizes the power of modern web technology to make your website incredibly fast. You will have full control and you will never be restricted by an overall theme that limits your design.
If you are a creative, we have made Portfoliobox for you. 

















Be in control - without restricting theme

            With most other website builders you are forced to select a theme for your website before you begin creating it. Usually it is easy to find a nice looking theme, but themes are not unique and very hard to modify.
        

            We believe creatives need liberty. Your personal website must be truly unique. A digital portfolio reflecting who you are. Therefor, with Portfoliobox you are never restricted by an overall theme that limits your design. You are free to use any template on any page and you can combine pages as you wish, the number of combinations are infinite.
        



Super fast - thanks to the latest technologies

            The website that you build with Portfoliobox 3 will look like a normal website, but it will be quick as an app. Portfoliobox is built with the latest web technologies and that will make your website incredible fast.
        

Never wait - All updates are instant
            As a creative you are used to have have full control of your tools. With the Portfoliobox Admin panel you will have full control of your website. All changes are updated instantly and you will never have to wait for something to be saved. You see what you do and that makes it easy for you to create your website.
        

Modern web technology enables instant browsing
            Normally when clicking a link in the menu of a website the entire page will reload. You will have to download all the files again and wait for the server. With Portfoliobox 3 you will never have to wait like that again. When a user clicks a link in your menu the page will load immediately.

We've all seen the Hoarding shows on television--people living in filth and squalor due to the little understood mental illness that keeps them trapped in their things.
But have you ever thought about what happens to their CHILDREN?  
Millions of American children are growing up in stifling chaos, with nowhere to turn.  Due to the shame and secrecy of their plight, only a very small percentage are rescued by Child Protective Services.  Once they turn 18, they no longer qualify for services and yet frequently cannot see a way out:



They do not have the basic, daily living skills that many of us take for granted.


They have no place to relax, take a shower, or do laundry.


They have nowhere to stay when they come home for Christmas or summer vacation, and no place to go while they save money for a place of their own.


Until now.
We are building a Refuge--a retreat and education center specifically designed to provide adult children of hoarders with a place to go.  It will be a clean, open space where they can take classes in simple cooking, cleaning, and personal finance; come visit just to get cleaned up or get away for a few hours; or come live for awhile until they can get out on their own.
My husband and I have already invested the majority of the funds to make this happen, but we are running out of money, and we need your help to finish it.
What We Need 
 We need a minimum of $50,000 to complete our vision:


During construction, our washing machine broke and flooded two of the rooms.  We now need to purchase new appliances, repair the damage, and refurbish the laundry room.  Having a clean space to do laundry is a huge part of the services we plan to provide!  $10,000
Earlier this year, one of the trees on our property fell on our neighbors house!  We have additional trees that are precariously close as well, and they need to be removed before winter.  $5000
Due to unforeseen expenses on the inside projects, we have no money left over for the grounds.  This is the primary location where people will come, relax, hang out, and get away for awhile!  $35,000

Those are our immediate needs, but they are just the tip of the iceberg.  We will also need funds for ongoing maintenance, to cover fees for professional counselors we may bring in, to pay for marketing efforts to let people know that we are here, to buy books for our onsite library, etc.
With enough funds, we could add additional temporary stay units, or even buy another house to serve another community!

<h3><span style=""color: #3db232;""><strong>Must we continue as we are? If you think it’s time for a new leadership narrative - for a new ""1%' to step forward - then here’s your chance to help make sure that happens.</strong></span></h3>
<strong><br/></strong>For over 20 years, hundreds of accomplished individuals from around the world - business people, teachers/academics, artist/performers, NPO/NGO leaders and more - have gathered to discuss how to leverage our expertise and resources for the making of a better planet.

We have done so with the shared conviction that exponential advances in technology will continue to <em>profoundly </em>reshape the human condition in all arenas – social, economic, political, environmental, spiritual and security. <br/><br/>Out of this chaos of disruption, an age of abundance is within our grasp. Such an age promises to liberate humanity so that we might seize the fullest potential of the human spirit and intellect.

<br/><br/>But it threatens too.

<br/><br/>It gives life to forces of ignorance and reaction that too often find comfort in simplistic solutions. We believe we are facing a pivot point in history – one path leading to enlightened possibilities, the other to dystopian certainty.

<br/><br/>The tools to render a bountiful world for the benefit of all exist today. What prevents its realization is a systemic lack of leadership. However, we believe that a global cohort of leaders <em>does </em>exist who by virtue of the works that they have created are exemplars, and that if made a community, together have the power and potential to ensure that the destiny of enlightened possibilities is the path humanity elects to take. <div>
<br/><div>We call them Renaissance Leaders.<br/><br/><div>

<ul>
<li>A high integrity individual with sensitive self-awareness and a passion for advancing their enterprise, their community and the world. </li>

<li>A leader who demonstrate the ability to take input from these various disciplines, synthesize it and integrate it for application to a specific situation. </li>

  Member Engagement
</span>
<br/><br/><strong>The leader-creators among us are successful because they have ideas, are passionate about achievement and care about our world. REX membership will give them a voice, both globally and locally.</strong>
<br/><br/>Here’s how.<br/><br/>The viral growth and ultimate success of REX will be determined by the effectiveness of global theme-specific ‘Missions’ launched and hosted on the REX community platform (renaissance-expedition.org) and local ‘Salons’ that will establish a physical footprint for REX wherever a critical mass of members is established.

Both channels will be volunteer run, with self-service support provided by REX through the community platform. Both channels will encourage members to discuss, elevate and pursue actions consistent with the Charter. Over time, as membership grows, these channels will become the means by which programs will be developed to foster, support, fund and otherwise advance REX initiatives through purpose-specific charitable foundations.

<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442838359/pjatemlzikfoicmxh09e.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><br/>Note that a key differentiator is the role of self-interest. It is held to be a truism that viral growth can only be achieved by addressing the ‘what’s in it for me’ challenge. We believe that enlightened self-interest MUST be reconciled with the adoption of the REX Charter. Accordingly, both channels will provide opportunities for members to do business with (and/or otherwise support) one another <strong><em>consistent with the Charter</em></strong> with the view that doing so is ultimately to the advantage of all. </div>

</ul>
We promise to be responsible with your money - we are very good at being thrifty.

<br/><br/>Each dollar you contribute is a vote for the Renaissance 
Expedition Charter, and demonstrates to prospective sponsors and

  Other Ways You Can Help
</span>
<br/><br/>The thing about a movement is that it needs - well, movement. If
 you have made it this far down, it's likely you are a believer in our 
Expedition. Whether you have been able to contribute or not, you can 
help us tremendously by forwarding the link to this campaign along to as
 many of your friends, family and colleagues as you think would be 
flattered to receive it. And movement is about noise - social media 
noise. The more you share, post, or re-post on Twitter, Facebook, 
LinkedIn, Pinterist, Google +, Instagram or any other platforms (or 
combination thereof), the more we get the word out. Go ahead, make some 
noise!
<br/><br/>We will also be looking for help from professional services 
organizations and/or freelancers and interns (on a pro-bono basis 
initially) for community management, fundraising strategy/execution, and
 NPO operations - including office space.  If you have the expertise, 
time and resource, and believe in the Charter and want to help make it happen, we'd love to hear from you!<br/><br/>And finally, if you are interested in being a founder of a Salon, or a thought leader for one of our Missions, please reach out to us via the 'Contact' link to the bottom right of the video above.<br/><br/>Join our <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/grp/home?gid=8241952"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LinkedIn</a> group and keep in touch.

  The Details
</span>
<div>
<strong><br/><strong>First Principles</strong><br/></strong><br/><strong></strong><ul>
<li>In an age of abundance, self-interest and societal interest need
 no longer be in conflict. While enlightened self-interest lies at the 
heart of discovery, innovation and creation, its application is best 
nurtured and rewarded within a healthy, vibrant, affluent community.
</li>
<li>We must lead by example. The REX community must attract, empower and
 mobilize members who understand the dynamics of collective strength and
 actions.</li>
<li>Its members are all ‘leader creators’ - those who are distinguished 
for having created and/or run private, public or not-for-profit 
enterprises, or those who are viewed as accomplished contributors to the
 arts, sciences, humanities and/or social discourse.</li>
<li>REX is a self-sustaining movement, an evolving eco-system that will 
define the objectives and determine the outcomes – from the bottom-up, 
not the top-down.</li>
<li>Accordingly, REX will provide the ‘North Star’ of the movement 
– our Charter - the aspirational scaffolding needed to empower the 
community we recruit. Our strength is in the constant pursuit of the 
promise and potential of the Charter by the network we build and 
mobilize.</li>
<li>REX must strive to be as philosophically agnostic/secular as 
possible – an impactful centrist movement that rejects and is a 
counter-force to the deceptively seductive alternatives offered by 
ideologues and extremists on either side of the political spectrum.</li>
<li>Recognizing that the need for leadership is systemic, it is thus global, multi-sectoral and especially, multi-generational.</li>
<li>A foundational value of REX is that its members commit to help each 
other to achieve professional success and thus secure positions of 
influence and power within their domain - to be remarkable human beings 
and thus be makers and enablers of exceptional communities/societies 
through peer networking, coaching and purposeful collaboration, 
regardless of background or skill set.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Missions </strong><br/><br/>The impact of REX will be manifested in the ‘Missions’ that it launches and presents to its membership and the world. The name is used in the diplomatic/political sense, and describes horizontal streams that cut across Salon membership, creating global communities of interest, expertise and commitment – led by recognized thought leaders. <br/><br/>The Missions of the Renaissance Expedition will each serve to frame the community’s objectives, initiatives and requisite outcomes with the purpose of provoking a demonstrable shift in the <strong>global </strong>leadership narrative by 2020, consistent with the spirit and substance of the Charter. They will ultimately do so in the following theatres;<ul>
<li>Arts &amp; Culture</li>
<li>Coaching, Mentoring &amp; Facilitating</li>
<li>Education</li>
<li>Governance</li>
<li>Health &amp; Wellness</li>
<li>Human Capital</li>
<li>Justice &amp; Law</li>
<li>Media</li>
<li>Philanthropy &amp; Social Responsibility</li>
<li>Science &amp; Technology</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Spirituality</li>
<li>Sports &amp; Entertainment</li>
<li>Sustainability &amp; The Environment</li>
<li>Wealth Making &amp; Distribution</li>
</ul>The Missions' objectives are to;<ul>
<li>Create a global cohort of exemplars that by their growing numbers and achievements and subject matter interest attracts qualified membership to the REX Community</li>
<li>Provide a professional networking opportunity for Members.</li>
<li>Provide theatre-specific thought leadership consistent with the Charter.</li>
<li>Lead the setting of Mission objectives, and the design and execution of initiatives and programs to secure said objectives consistent with the Charter.</li>
<li>Qualified initiatives and programs would include (but would not be limited too);<ul>
<li>Projects that directly recognize, encourage and support the development of Renaissance Leadership.</li>
<li>Projects that by their impact and example promote the values of Renaissance Leadership.</li>
<li>Projects that otherwise bias for success efforts to build the world envisioned in the Charter</li>
<li>Liaise and interact with Salons if, when and as appropriate.<ul><li>For example, having the ‘Education’ Mission work with Salon sponsored local scholarship/mentoring initiatives.</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>It is important to note that <b>all</b> REX members will be automatically enrolled in the Coaching, Mentoring and Facilitating Mission, given it's importance.  Accordingly, each member will be expected to provide and profit from, at least 2 hours of cross-mentoring each month with a relevant dyad partner.<br/><br/><strong>Salons </strong><br/><span style=""color: #3db232; font-size: 30px; font-weight: regular; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;""></span><strong><br/></strong>The Salons of the Renaissance Expedition will each serve to frame the community’s objectives, initiatives and desired outcomes with the purpose of provoking a demonstrable shift in the <strong>local, geographically-focused </strong>leadership narrative by 2020, consistent with the spirit and substance of the Charter. The objectives are to; <ul>
<li>Create and engage a local cohort of exemplars that by their growing numbers and achievements attracts qualified membership to the REX Community</li>
<li>Provide a socialization and professional networking opportunity for Members</li>
<li>Lead the setting of Salon objectives, and the design and execution of initiatives and programs to secure said objectives.</li>
<li>Qualified initiatives and programs include (but are not limited too);<ul>
<li>Projects that directly recognize, encourage and support the development of Renaissance Leadership.</li>
<li>Projects that by their impact and example promote the values of Renaissance Leadership.</li>
<li>Projects that otherwise bias for success efforts to build the world envisioned in the Charter.</li>
<li>Liaise and interact with other Salons and/or Missions if, when and as, appropriate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>Salons will be self-forming wherever a critical mass of members exist, supported and administered by self-service tools on the REX community platform. Utilizing a proven formula, the principle member engagement event will be a monthly meeting of up to 30 participants. The agenda for a Salon would look like the following:<ul>
<li>Private dining room secured for monthly meetings at restaurant</li>
<li>Same day/time/venue each month - 6:00pm to 9:30pm</li>
<li>Drinks, introductions</li>
<li>Member presentation – member presents their enterprise/interest – networking opportunity</li>
<li>Main event - Dinner presentation and Discussion<ul><li>Host selected speaker speaks to a REX theme/Salon project</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>

  The Risks &amp; Challenges
</span>
<br/><br/>We are an odd kind of start-up - a non-profit-organization with 
veteran management, a 20-year legacy and the experience and commitment 
of hundreds of accomplished members from around the world to draw on.

But of course there are risks. Some to consider:
</p>
<ul>
<li>We might not raise enough here to launch the Expedition through 
this campaign. Or, we might raise enough now, and not be able to 
leverage that by raising additional funds later, and/or developing new 
revenue streams.</li>
<li>We might find, despite our experience to date, that the concept of 
the Renaissance Expedition simply doesn't resonate with you, or enough 
people like you. If a critical mass of you don't agree with our value

</div></div>","Must we continue as we are? If you think it’s time for a new leadership narrative - for a new ""1%' to step forward - then here’s your chance to help make sure that happens.
For over 20 years, hundreds of accomplished individuals from around the world - business people, teachers/academics, artist/performers, NPO/NGO leaders and more - have gathered to discuss how to leverage our expertise and resources for the making of a better planet.

We have done so with the shared conviction that exponential advances in technology will continue to profoundly reshape the human condition in all arenas – social, economic, political, environmental, spiritual and security. Out of this chaos of disruption, an age of abundance is within our grasp. Such an age promises to liberate humanity so that we might seize the fullest potential of the human spirit and intellect.

But it threatens too.

It gives life to forces of ignorance and reaction that too often find comfort in simplistic solutions. We believe we are facing a pivot point in history – one path leading to enlightened possibilities, the other to dystopian certainty.

The tools to render a bountiful world for the benefit of all exist today. What prevents its realization is a systemic lack of leadership. However, we believe that a global cohort of leaders does exist who by virtue of the works that they have created are exemplars, and that if made a community, together have the power and potential to ensure that the destiny of enlightened possibilities is the path humanity elects to take. 
We call them Renaissance Leaders.


  A Renaissance Leader is...




A high integrity individual with sensitive self-awareness and a passion for advancing their enterprise, their community and the world. 
A creator with a sense of history and the capacity to see the world holistically, to practice systems thinking, to inject a global and a future perspective into present challenges, to honour diversity, and to draw on ideas and best practices from diverse disciplines and economic sectors. 
A leader who demonstrate the ability to take input from these various disciplines, synthesize it and integrate it for application to a specific situation. 
An exemplar who demonstrates grace under pressure, and inspires others to have the courage to collaborate and innovate in order to dramatically improve enterprise or community performance. 




  The Renaissance Expedition is...A movement which is committed to identify, connect, mentor and promote the efforts of a diverse community of change leaders with similar values and strategic intentions whose purpose is improving individual, organizational, community and global performance.
 


  The Objective of the           Renaissance Expedition (REX)...
To create a movement that identifies, engages and mobilizes the global cohort of leader/creators who share a common value system and sense of shared destiny - the new ""1%' of those uniquely positioned to change the leadership narrative.  A group committed to start impacting systemic global change in just three years.  We will do so by recruiting, supporting and promoting the elevation of no fewer than 20,000 REx members by 2018, and 100,000 by 2020, to positions of domain influence and power - to insert and nurture a new ‘renaissance’ leadership gene into the global DNA from class-room to boardroom to legislature.



  Our Charter...


We believe in a world of abundance where we are each held to be responsible for, and accountable to, ourselves. Thus empowered, we are obligated to conduct ourselves so as to better enable a future where in spirit and practice;

All citizens are equal before the law.
All citizens have access to, and enjoy the same voting rights. 
Discrimination, prejudice and violence are not tolerated.
All citizens are free to express themselves as they wish, without threat, harm or repercussion.
All citizens have the right to, and enjoyment of, personal security and property protection. 

All citizens have access to, and enjoy the same right to privacy.
All citizens have access to nutritious and affordable food, clean water and clean air.
All citizens have access to such education as is necessary to realize one's wants, needs and desires. 

All citizens have access to healthcare that provides for a long and well-lived life. 

All citizens can pursue a livelihood that provides for, a productive, accomplished and rewarding life, lived with dignity. 

For those who cannot provide for themselves, access to such means as allows for a life that is as productive, accomplished and rewarding as their circumsatnce allows for, lived with dignity. 

The natural world, including species and eco-systems, are valued and respected.

We ALL endeavour to lead by example. 






  Member Engagement

The leader-creators among us are successful because they have ideas, are passionate about achievement and care about our world. REX membership will give them a voice, both globally and locally.
Here’s how.The viral growth and ultimate success of REX will be determined by the effectiveness of global theme-specific ‘Missions’ launched and hosted on the REX community platform (renaissance-expedition.org) and local ‘Salons’ that will establish a physical footprint for REX wherever a critical mass of members is established.

Both channels will be volunteer run, with self-service support provided by REX through the community platform. Both channels will encourage members to discuss, elevate and pursue actions consistent with the Charter. Over time, as membership grows, these channels will become the means by which programs will be developed to foster, support, fund and otherwise advance REX initiatives through purpose-specific charitable foundations.


Note that a key differentiator is the role of self-interest. It is held to be a truism that viral growth can only be achieved by addressing the ‘what’s in it for me’ challenge. We believe that enlightened self-interest MUST be reconciled with the adoption of the REX Charter. Accordingly, both channels will provide opportunities for members to do business with (and/or otherwise support) one another consistent with the Charter with the view that doing so is ultimately to the advantage of all. 
See 'The Details'  below for further information.   


  What You get

By being a Founding Contributor, you are demonstrating your 
belief in the REX Charter – what it holds to be true and the purpose it 
aspires too - and your conviction that there is a systemic deficit at a 
time when the global leadership narrative needs a fix. Your contribution
 will be a first critical foundation stone of a movement that could 
change the world.

You will also be the co-creator of a community of like minded peers committed to supporting and promoting you/your enterprise in the pursuit of your goals and objectives - locally and globally!And, as we've noted, the money helps, but for many of the Perks on 
the right we are genuinely interested in knowing who you think we should
 be targeting for membership, helping us, funding us and otherwise 
working with us. Your engagement will literally help shape us.

 


  How Will We Use Your Contribution?

We are converting a group of hundreds of accomplished 
individuals to a movement of thousands. That means establishing a 
not-for-profit organization and getting it ready to be the scaffolding 
for REX. We welcome your financial support now, as a Founding 
Contributor, per the 'Perks' options to the right.  Our immediate 
needs/goals:

Start-up legal, administrative and marketing costs.
Design work and customization of community platform/website, including CRM integration for November 1st 'live' date.

Engagement of a Webmaster and Community Manager(s) 
Commence recruiting of first Salon leaders - target date for first 'live' salons - January 2016.

Commence recruiting of first Mission leaders - target date for first 'live' Missions February 2016.

Nominal honorariums to start-up team members.
Start-up travel expenses for start-up team members.
To give us the runway necessary to secure benefactor support and/or sponsorships.

We promise to be responsible with your money - we are very good at being thrifty.

Each dollar you contribute is a vote for the Renaissance 
Expedition Charter, and demonstrates to prospective sponsors and 
benefactors that we are a growing and significant movement with impact –
 one worth supporting.


  Other Ways You Can Help

The thing about a movement is that it needs - well, movement. If
 you have made it this far down, it's likely you are a believer in our 
Expedition. Whether you have been able to contribute or not, you can 
help us tremendously by forwarding the link to this campaign along to as
 many of your friends, family and colleagues as you think would be 
flattered to receive it. And movement is about noise - social media 
noise. The more you share, post, or re-post on Twitter, Facebook, 
LinkedIn, Pinterist, Google +, Instagram or any other platforms (or 
combination thereof), the more we get the word out. Go ahead, make some 
noise!
We will also be looking for help from professional services 
organizations and/or freelancers and interns (on a pro-bono basis 
initially) for community management, fundraising strategy/execution, and
 NPO operations - including office space.  If you have the expertise, 
time and resource, and believe in the Charter and want to help make it happen, we'd love to hear from you!And finally, if you are interested in being a founder of a Salon, or a thought leader for one of our Missions, please reach out to us via the 'Contact' link to the bottom right of the video above.Join our LinkedIn group and keep in touch.

  The Details


First Principles
In an age of abundance, self-interest and societal interest need
 no longer be in conflict. While enlightened self-interest lies at the 
heart of discovery, innovation and creation, its application is best 
nurtured and rewarded within a healthy, vibrant, affluent community.

We must lead by example. The REX community must attract, empower and
 mobilize members who understand the dynamics of collective strength and
 actions.
Its members are all ‘leader creators’ - those who are distinguished 
for having created and/or run private, public or not-for-profit 
enterprises, or those who are viewed as accomplished contributors to the
 arts, sciences, humanities and/or social discourse.
REX is a self-sustaining movement, an evolving eco-system that will 
define the objectives and determine the outcomes – from the bottom-up, 
not the top-down.
Accordingly, REX will provide the ‘North Star’ of the movement 
– our Charter - the aspirational scaffolding needed to empower the 
community we recruit. Our strength is in the constant pursuit of the 
promise and potential of the Charter by the network we build and 
mobilize.
REX must strive to be as philosophically agnostic/secular as 
possible – an impactful centrist movement that rejects and is a 
counter-force to the deceptively seductive alternatives offered by 
ideologues and extremists on either side of the political spectrum.
Recognizing that the need for leadership is systemic, it is thus global, multi-sectoral and especially, multi-generational.
A foundational value of REX is that its members commit to help each 
other to achieve professional success and thus secure positions of 
influence and power within their domain - to be remarkable human beings 
and thus be makers and enablers of exceptional communities/societies 
through peer networking, coaching and purposeful collaboration, 
regardless of background or skill set.

Missions The impact of REX will be manifested in the ‘Missions’ that it launches and presents to its membership and the world. The name is used in the diplomatic/political sense, and describes horizontal streams that cut across Salon membership, creating global communities of interest, expertise and commitment – led by recognized thought leaders. The Missions of the Renaissance Expedition will each serve to frame the community’s objectives, initiatives and requisite outcomes with the purpose of provoking a demonstrable shift in the global leadership narrative by 2020, consistent with the spirit and substance of the Charter. They will ultimately do so in the following theatres;
Arts & Culture
Coaching, Mentoring & Facilitating
Education
Governance
Health & Wellness
Human Capital
Justice & Law
Media
Philanthropy & Social Responsibility
Science & Technology
Security
Spirituality
Sports & Entertainment
Sustainability & The Environment
Wealth Making & Distribution
The Missions' objectives are to;
Create a global cohort of exemplars that by their growing numbers and achievements and subject matter interest attracts qualified membership to the REX Community
Provide a professional networking opportunity for Members.
Provide theatre-specific thought leadership consistent with the Charter.
Lead the setting of Mission objectives, and the design and execution of initiatives and programs to secure said objectives consistent with the Charter.
Qualified initiatives and programs would include (but would not be limited too);
Projects that directly recognize, encourage and support the development of Renaissance Leadership.
Projects that by their impact and example promote the values of Renaissance Leadership.
Projects that otherwise bias for success efforts to build the world envisioned in the Charter
Liaise and interact with Salons if, when and as appropriate.For example, having the ‘Education’ Mission work with Salon sponsored local scholarship/mentoring initiatives.



It is important to note that all REX members will be automatically enrolled in the Coaching, Mentoring and Facilitating Mission, given it's importance.  Accordingly, each member will be expected to provide and profit from, at least 2 hours of cross-mentoring each month with a relevant dyad partner.Salons The Salons of the Renaissance Expedition will each serve to frame the community’s objectives, initiatives and desired outcomes with the purpose of provoking a demonstrable shift in the local, geographically-focused leadership narrative by 2020, consistent with the spirit and substance of the Charter. The objectives are to; 
Create and engage a local cohort of exemplars that by their growing numbers and achievements attracts qualified membership to the REX Community
Provide a socialization and professional networking opportunity for Members
Lead the setting of Salon objectives, and the design and execution of initiatives and programs to secure said objectives.
Qualified initiatives and programs include (but are not limited too);
Projects that directly recognize, encourage and support the development of Renaissance Leadership.
Projects that by their impact and example promote the values of Renaissance Leadership.
Projects that otherwise bias for success efforts to build the world envisioned in the Charter.
Liaise and interact with other Salons and/or Missions if, when and as, appropriate.


Salons will be self-forming wherever a critical mass of members exist, supported and administered by self-service tools on the REX community platform. Utilizing a proven formula, the principle member engagement event will be a monthly meeting of up to 30 participants. The agenda for a Salon would look like the following:
Private dining room secured for monthly meetings at restaurant
Same day/time/venue each month - 6:00pm to 9:30pm
Drinks, introductions
Member presentation – member presents their enterprise/interest – networking opportunity
Main event - Dinner presentation and DiscussionHost selected speaker speaks to a REX theme/Salon project





  The Risks & Challenges

We are an odd kind of start-up - a non-profit-organization with 
veteran management, a 20-year legacy and the experience and commitment 
of hundreds of accomplished members from around the world to draw on.

But of course there are risks. Some to consider:


We might not raise enough here to launch the Expedition through 
this campaign. Or, we might raise enough now, and not be able to 
leverage that by raising additional funds later, and/or developing new 
revenue streams.
We might find, despite our experience to date, that the concept of 
the Renaissance Expedition simply doesn't resonate with you, or enough 
people like you. If a critical mass of you don't agree with our value 
proposition, we won’t succeed.
Yes, it's true - execution is everything. If not everything, then a
 lot. You can have a great idea with lousy execution. It's possible 
that's us.
There are a lot of very good organizations/causes competing for 
your money and attention, with only so much of either to go around.

There are a few good reasons why we might fail, but there are already hundreds why we will succeed.

folks thanks for reading. Since 2009 I have dedicated my life to raising
awareness of how gambling is getting out of control in our society and the
social consequences of it.<br/>
It hasn't been an easy journey!<br/>
<br/>
The Neuroliberation campaign started out to tackle the 'gambling act 2005'
which meant that lots of our community shops are now being taken over by
betting shops and lots of innocent people are being affected it by through
crime ect.<br/>
<br/>
The real genuine change that needs to happen (and actually is
slowly thanks to this and similar campaigns) is that we need to change
perception. Often it's simply about reminding people simple facts or boosted
peoples education.<br/>
Betting shops are everywhere, online gambling is rife, government profit from
it, health research is corrupt and our society is going down the drain.<br/>
<br/>
Not many people are aware this is actually happening though, even though often
it is right infront of their very eyes....a lot of people even believe there is
no problem, and can you blame them with the amount of pro-gambling propaganda
out there?</p>
<p>But we are here to change that, educate and empower people, challenge
industries and make a change.</p>
<p>We don't claim to solve and rid the world of all it's problems,
but with your help we can certainly be one of those cogs in the machine that
can make change behind the scenes. It doesn't matter if we don't get any credit
by the end of it, we'l have done our job and changed minds.<br/>
<br/>
Sooo , here's the crunch and the whole point of the fundraiser... we need a DVD
duplicator as well as other materials in order to give out our digital campaign
packs.... these consist ofour
educational films (already produced) , lots of eye-opening research, and
tips on how people can themselves easily and effortlessly help contribute to
making change.</p>
<p>The campaign is ran and managed by me, Ben Thacker (aka Ben
Westwood).. for six years I have worked tirelessly on this , all with a total
outside donations pot of around £200 (although we have received some DVD
donations recently for this project, thanks peeps)</p>
<p>Achievements of the campaign to date are as follows.<br/>
<br/>
- Blog visitors everyday<br/>
-Awareness raised to people on almost daily basis via social media<br/>
- Heaps of radio interviews on this subject and the campaign<br/>
- Campaign founder featured on 4thought TV<br/>
- Featured on the 'What's up show' aired on Pick TV<br/>
- 2 grassroots documentaries produced and shared on social media<br/>
<br/>
Current aims and petitions.<br/>
<br/>
Currently we are tackling Kellogg's over their bandit machine branding cereal
'Krave Choco Roulette' and are planning to tackle Dorito's over their blatant
Roulette casino advertising campaigns.<br/>
But we need your help to get this campaign bigger to educate people and get
more onboard.</p>
<p>Depending on how fundraising goes...if we achieve more than our
target...big smiles all round and full steam ahead!</p>
<p>What we need DVD duplicator which we can get for £250 or even
less. Otherwise I If we can get a decent quality one for less with a warranty
we'll do that. Any surplus money will be spend on disks, petitions, stickers ect which
will be sent out to people... if you have donated then please contact the
campaign and a pack will be sent to you asap.<br/>
<br/>
Without a disk duplicator this idea can't really be done, as it wont take long
for laptops to break as it's not just the disk drive we'd need to worry about
but also the processors.<br/>
<br/>
A cheap second hand printer we can get cheap or free, with inks ect...that
would really speed the campaign up bigtime! Stickers and other materials also.<br/>
<br/>
£600 is a really low target and in the long run we'll need more but for now,
look what's been achieved from only £200 outside donations!! ... although after
six years I'm getting older and after £1000's of my own money spent on this
(and having never been abroad yet in my life when I could have) I hope I have
proved my dedication to this. <br/>
<br/>
With your help we can do this.<br/>
Thanks for reading.<br/>

- Blog visitors everyday
-Awareness raised to people on almost daily basis via social media
- Heaps of radio interviews on this subject and the campaign
- Campaign founder featured on 4thought TV
- Featured on the 'What's up show' aired on Pick TV
- 2 grassroots documentaries produced and shared on social media

Current aims and petitions.

Currently we are tackling Kellogg's over their bandit machine branding cereal
'Krave Choco Roulette' and are planning to tackle Dorito's over their blatant
Roulette casino advertising campaigns.
But we need your help to get this campaign bigger to educate people and get
more onboard.
Depending on how fundraising goes...if we achieve more than our
target...big smiles all round and full steam ahead!
What we need DVD duplicator which we can get for £250 or even
less. Otherwise I If we can get a decent quality one for less with a warranty
we'll do that. Any surplus money will be spend on disks, petitions, stickers ect which
will be sent out to people... if you have donated then please contact the
campaign and a pack will be sent to you asap.

Without a disk duplicator this idea can't really be done, as it wont take long
for laptops to break as it's not just the disk drive we'd need to worry about
but also the processors.

A cheap second hand printer we can get cheap or free, with inks ect...that
would really speed the campaign up bigtime! Stickers and other materials also.

£600 is a really low target and in the long run we'll need more but for now,
look what's been achieved from only £200 outside donations!! ... although after
six years I'm getting older and after £1000's of my own money spent on this
(and having never been abroad yet in my life when I could have) I hope I have
proved my dedication to this. 

With your help we can do this.
Thanks for reading.

<p>Growler Haus is an

than with its competitors in the craft beer market.  To summarize we
consider Our unique competitive advantages to be:</p>
<p><b><i>Our Tribe.</i></b>  Growler Haus works hard, even before a
craft beer location is opened, to build a dedicated tribe of individuals who feel
and share a type of ownership in the space and success of Growler Haus. It is
this “tribe” that becomes integral to the early and sustaining success of
Growler Haus and its unique market offering. As an energetic and
community-minded coalition, our tribe is often a mix of seasoned professionals
including corporate managers, medical doctors, academic professors, artists and
entrepreneurs. Growler Haus will put its tribe up against any other customer
base or affinity group in craft beer today. </p>

<p><b><i>Our Locations.</i></b>  Growler Haus is focused on pioneering

areas, Growler Haus can be a first mover and define the local craft beer
marketplace.</p>

than with its competitors in the craft beer market.  To summarize we
consider Our unique competitive advantages to be:
Our Tribe.  Growler Haus works hard, even before a
craft beer location is opened, to build a dedicated tribe of individuals who feel
and share a type of ownership in the space and success of Growler Haus. It is
this “tribe” that becomes integral to the early and sustaining success of
Growler Haus and its unique market offering. As an energetic and
community-minded coalition, our tribe is often a mix of seasoned professionals
including corporate managers, medical doctors, academic professors, artists and
entrepreneurs. Growler Haus will put its tribe up against any other customer
base or affinity group in craft beer today. 
Our Ecosystem. Growler Haus does host events for
football games, special holidays, and trivia nights. However, it goes one step
beyond by forming and supporting an entire ecosystem of unique groups for its
customers to join including: (i) Grain Ideas - new local
business ideas; (ii) Frothy Fellowship/Pub Theology - honest
discussions around topics of faith; (iii) Pints for the People - community
supported activities; and (iv) Home Brew Crew – home brewers
educating and demonstrating the art of home brewing.
Our Locations.  Growler Haus is focused on pioneering
craft beer environments into emerging South Carolina cities by capturing the
momentum of young and middle age professionals hungry for a community-gathering
place. By partnering with the local economic development, education and art
community officials interested in re-energizing and growing their downtown
areas, Growler Haus can be a first mover and define the local craft beer
marketplace.

<h3>Why We Need Your Help</h3> <p></p>
<p>Because our iGEM teams are independent student organization, we rely heavily on donations to support our training, research and outreach. Last year, it cost each team around $25,000 to attend the World Jamboree in Boston. This included flights, hotels, and Jamboree registration for 10 students. The Jamboree affords students a great opportunity to gain presentation experience and network with other students from around the world and with various biotechnology companies. For many students, iGEM is the first scientific conference that they experience, and it provides them with invaluable insight into professional careers in science.</p>

</div></div>","What is iGEM?

iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machines) is the largest annual international research competition in synthetic biology. Teams design novel biological solutions to real world problems by engineering genetic information to give an organism a new ability. Teams from universities worldwide then submit their solutions to iGEM as Biobricks, standardized biological parts, so they are available to other researchers. The competition culminates at the World Jamboree held in Boston, Massachusetts every autumn, where students have the opportunity to present their work.

<b>What's the big idea?!<br/></b>Fly!

accomplish a trick which matches the flyer's ability level,
culminating in transfer to a catcher on a separate trapeze and a
gentle landing in the safety net. 
Beginning classes
require no special skills; serious flyers may accept the challenge of
ever-increasing levels of difficulty. <br/><br/>Paula (our founder) has spent the past 2 years traveling to fly in many different schools.  While she loves to fly, she also loves watching beginners in their very first flying trapeze experience.  She has seen people from all backgrounds confront this unique challenge, and is excited to provide this growth opportunity to people in Idaho.  As a relatively new trapeze enthusiast, she remains ever-mindful of the transformative power of such an experience and is committed to ensuring a magical adventure to new and returning students!<br/>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Why we need your help:</b></p>
<p><b></b>The flying trapeze apparatus (called a rig) is an engineering feat!  While we have done our best to conserve expense, our priority lies in creating an exceptional experience for students.  As such, we have decided to make significant upgrades to our rig to enhance safety and comfort.  The upgrades add to the cost of the rig, and we need help with the added costs. <br/></p>
<p>Originally, we believed our entire rig would cost $15,000 and we budgeted appropriately.  Additional expenses include a brand new safety net ($5,,205), new platform and net poles ($2,800), and transportation (Paula and a U-Haul! $2,245; $245 over previous budget).  That's a grand total of $8,250 over our original budget.  Certainly, more unexpected expenses will arise.  Meeting this goal will go a long way toward handling the unexpected!</p>
<p>Expenses beyond our goal are many, including (most importantly) bringing the finest teachers and trapeze professionals from across the country to Boise for our season.  Apparently, the nation has not yet realized that Boise is an amazing place to live, so finding these fabulous people has been more challenging than expected, and the relocation more costly.  Additional funds raised will be used to ensure we have the highest quality staff throughout our season.</p>

<h3>The Storyteller</h3>
<div>My name is Sebastian Santos. I’m a sophomore at Texas State University, pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Education. For this summer, I’m seeking the opportunity to travel with a close friend of mine from college, to take the time to reflect and take a break from school. Due to a circumstance that has placed my family and myself under tremendous financial burdens, I am giving this program a shot to make the best out of what I have and what can be utilized this summer of 2015.
I have travelled to many parts of the U.S. But on the other hand, I have not left the country in 14 years. This dates back to the year 2000, when I moved to the U.S. as a five-year-old, first generation Filipino-American. I’d like to travel back to the Philippines again in the future, but for this summer, I just need the time to take a break for myself and find some balance.
In exchange for the funding I receive, I would like to offer my stories throughout my travel in Colorado, through: postcards, pictures, vlogs, and other items that record my encounters.
Overall, I would like to use this opportunity to educate myself about the masses or demographics I may encounter on my trip. As an Education major with a focus on English, I will not take this trip as just another ordinary vacation; but an opportunity to equip myself with general knowledge on life.</div>
<h2><b>The Campaign</b></h2>

The Kayaker

My name is Aaron Hines and I am a meta-entrepreneur at Texas State University studying Economics. Some of my personal goals are to travel all 50 U.S. states, start at least one business, help as many people as I possibly can, and live a life serving God. KCCO. My passion is to start an outdoor recreation business after college that will specialize in unique, local, and alternative outdoor trips and rentals. Everything from kayaking, camping, and backpacking to national and international travel. This journey is not only for personal reasons of mine, but also as market research. I want to accomplish a couple goals. First, I would like to learn how to live, travel, and explore alternatively. Second, I am using this opportunity to apply my knowledge of business and economics to fund this expedition by creating incentives and other creative advertising and bartering through ecommerce. Lastly, I will be documenting everything about the trip in an effort to compile information, so that people who want to travel but do not have the money nor connections can learn how to do so.Off the beaten path we go.

The Storyteller
My name is Sebastian Santos. I’m a sophomore at Texas State University, pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Education. For this summer, I’m seeking the opportunity to travel with a close friend of mine from college, to take the time to reflect and take a break from school. Due to a circumstance that has placed my family and myself under tremendous financial burdens, I am giving this program a shot to make the best out of what I have and what can be utilized this summer of 2015.
I have travelled to many parts of the U.S. But on the other hand, I have not left the country in 14 years. This dates back to the year 2000, when I moved to the U.S. as a five-year-old, first generation Filipino-American. I’d like to travel back to the Philippines again in the future, but for this summer, I just need the time to take a break for myself and find some balance.
In exchange for the funding I receive, I would like to offer my stories throughout my travel in Colorado, through: postcards, pictures, vlogs, and other items that record my encounters.
Overall, I would like to use this opportunity to educate myself about the masses or demographics I may encounter on my trip. As an Education major with a focus on English, I will not take this trip as just another ordinary vacation; but an opportunity to equip myself with general knowledge on life.

Risks & Challenges

 Honestly, there is a 100% risk of this trip not being completed. Any number of things could happen to me or anyone on my team. We could fall prey to harm, disease, or being without food and shelter. We could certainly run out of finances if our efforts fail. We could lose our passports and become stuck in Canada. We could doubt ourselves and give up. We could fall into uncertainty and not even attempt the trip. 
Fortunately, I believe we will be successful no matter what happens as long as we make the attempt. We will be successful whether we got as far as 3 miles or 3,000 miles from where we began. I truly am afraid of all the risks and challenges, but my faith in God and other people will help me overcome this fear and follow this dream.

</h3> This project is based on trying to bring some solid real change for local communities in one of the ten poorest countries in the world. This project is currently focused on the Ponta Mamoli area of Southern Mozambique where our projects efforts have already begun. Because we have managed to build a relationship with the local chief, we find ourselves in a position to drastically improve the lives and reality of an entire village of people if we can get enough support. By keeping it on a small local scale, it is reassuring to know that all the money is going directly towards the people in Ponta Mamoli where a dollar goes a very long way.<br/><br/>The birth of this project came after the wedding of Tanya and Lee Rabideau.  Tanya, a South African native, and Lee, originally from Colorado, brought people from around the globe to celebrate their commitment to each other.   While it was such a beautiful setting, some of the attendees were more interested in the local community and the people that inhabited the lands.  In witnessing the difficult conditions that the people of Ponta Malomi lived in, the Mozambique Live Long Project was born.  <br/><br/>The first campaign funded by Mozambique Live Long was the Wedding Wells Water Project.  This was privately funded by friends and family of the Rabideaus.   This project focused on the installation of ten borehole wells to provide potable water sources that are spread throughout the area of Ponta Mamoli.  Instead of traveling miles daily to poor river water sources, they now have a self sustaining source that can prevent the detrimental health issues that exist with dehydration.   This is a major important step in bringing basic needs to a population that has the average life expectancy of 43 years (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erh8_-u-NYQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erh8_-u-NYQ</a>).<br/><br/>While the boreholes have made a huge difference in the lives of the people in Ponta Mamoli, the amount of malnourished children is still something we feel compelled to address. The next campaign that we are focusing on will build on the previous work.  The Free Food Foundation Project looks to build micro-ecosystems around the recently installed boreholes.  Focused on reforestation and sustainability, the project aims to leverage the local water source to build a micro-ecosystem that can provide food and medicinal plants. With the cooperation and buy-in of the local community, this project could bring a food source that will continue to provide for years to come (please see the following short video for a better idea: <a href=""http://www.dw.com/en/living-with-hiv-in-mozambique/av-18650525)."" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.dw.com/en/living-with-hiv-in-mozambique/av-18650525"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.dw.com/en/living-with-hiv-in-mozambique/av-18650525</a>).</div><div><br/></div><div>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>In 2014 the NHS spent an eyewatering £5.5bn of taxpayers money on Temp Nurses and allied health care professionals.  The private sector spent a similar insane amount.   </p>
<p>Most of the hourly rate charged by these agencies are fees.  Some reports show that Nurses who were paid just £19 ph are being charged out at £45 ph.  The worst highligthed case being £155 ph. This is not unique to the UK, it happens everywhere including the USA, AUS, EU and it is time this travesty ended.</p>
<p>My name is Stephen Soos, I am the founder and CEO of Diamond Cutter Ltd which owns Staffer Healthcare.  I am developing a managed peer to peer app that connects the buyer of temp services directly to the temp Nurse.  Called Staffer and similar in paradigm to <a href=""www.Uber.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Uber.com</a>, Staffer instantly saves the buyer and taxpayer vast sums the second it is downloaded and deployed on any smart device or PC.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433660054/yciwftes9xj3elopghyu.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Staffer decentralises the provision of temp staff and puts control directly in the hands of the Buyer and the Nurse.  All direct and hidden costs are instantly eliminated the instant Staffer is downloaded and used.</p>
<p>We aim to release Staffer in London in Dec 2015, quickly followed by the rest of the UK, EU and other regions in 2016/17</p>
<p>Staffer will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Diamond Cutter ltd in August and will make it's money by adding just £/$1 per shift hour worked to the standard pay rate of the temp worker.<br/></p>
<p>Staffer Healthcare (Ltd) is a social business.  That's the same as a normal business because it will make money, pay it's taxes and a fair working wage, but<i> ALL </i>net profits go to saving lives of patients in the developing world via our partner <a href=""http://www.watsi.org,"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.watsi.org,</a> and to educating Dr's, Nurses, Dentists etc via our partner <a href=""http://www.watchmego.org."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.watchmego.org.</a></p>
<p>Unlike donating to charity, your money will be used to create a sustainable and profitable business that acts as a conduit of continuous funds for the above life changing crowdfunding sites.  Staffer massively reduces the burden on the tax payer and remove the carbon dumped annually into the atmosphere by 1000's of temp agencies around the world. </p>
<div>In summary your donation will:-</div>
<ul> <li>Save the tax payer £/$bn's pa.</li>
<li>Save lives in developing countries by paying directly for medical care. </li>
<li>Dramatically reduce the cost of health care service provision.</li>
<li>Help educate 1,000's of Dr's, Nurses, Dentist etc.</li> <li>Removes the hidden admin costs of hiring temps.</li>
<li>Gives the Nurse and buyer instant control and removes the middle man.</li> </ul> <p>Staffer is a highly disruptive technology that makes agencies obsolete and has an instant dramatic and far reaching impact on our wallets, lives, planet.  </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>I have funded the initial planning and development and need a further £100,000 to finish the app, hire a small team and deploy Staffer inside the M25 in Dec 2015.  Here is where funds will be used.</p> <ul> <li>£30,000 to finish the Staffer</li>
<li>£12,000 to hire outbound call centre for 3 months</li> <li>£6,000 for exhibition stand</li>
<li>£40,000 for initial marketing </li>
<li>£8,000 to set up small office</li>
<li>£4,000 contingency</li> </ul>
<div>If we don't reach our goal we will use whatever is raised to fund the above in order of importance and go to traditional funding sources for more, which is our plan once Staffer is deployed and making money.</div>
<div>You get my word that I will never take a basic wage or dividend payment from this project and will find a board of self made philanthropists who will do the same.  We will pay Managers and staff a fair wage to make Staffer a success.</div>
<div>For every single donation of £100 we will give you a gift card of £5 to use on waste.org so that you can experience the joy of reaching out in fellowship and saving someones life.  For every cumulative £100 donated we will choose a patient on Watsi.org and donate £5.</div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact Of Your Donation</h3> <p>If you give £1 to a charity, that money has gone, it is used up.  if you donate to make Staffer a reality that £1 is multiplied many times by the money making activities of the company.  It makes that £1 reach out into the future again and again.</p>
<p>Take time to look at wasti.org and watchmego.org and experience how the people behind these organisations are positively impacting the lives of so many of our brothers and sisters in the places where it is needed.  I invite you to be part of this for a one time donation.</p>
<p>Staffer Healthcare takes the waste of outrageous agency fees and gives it back to  you, the tax payer.  Staffer makes a fair usage charge that is used exclusively to positively impact as many lives as possible on a continuing basis.</p>
<p>I have the experience and network to make Staffer the huge success that it deserves and is destined to be.</p>
<p>I am building Staffer on the principles of oneness and fairness.  I am following the examples given to the world by Mohammad Yunus by creating a sustainable business that exists for the benefit of all of us instead of its own interests.  </p>
<p>Staffer will play its part in fuelling the shift from the old industrial business model to the conscious value creating business model that is emerging and connecting us in new exciting ways.  Staffer is your opportunity to contribute and impact the future in a pervasive and powerful way.</p>
<p><a href=""https://watsi.org/welcome/medisico/medisico"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">You can see just how powerful watsi.org is by taking a look at the contribution page of my other business interests</a>.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">When a patient is funded on watsi.org the donator receives an email once the treatment has been delivered, it looks like this and is a joy to receive in your inbox at the end of a hard day.</span><br/></p>

<br/><p></p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The biggest challenge is to get to market before anyone else does, and I am sure I am not the only one thinking  along the lines of Staffer.  However, I believe that this risk is mitigated by the social nature of Staffer and all that will use it and be part of the value chain.</p>
<p>This kind of technology is more or less ""off the shelf"" these days.  The success of this project lies in the deployment.  We will adopt a similar city by city approach that Uber.com used in it's early days.  We will focus initially on the small care home operator who is being squeezed by regulation and high costs, who will instantly experience the benefit to their business and clients.</p>
<p>Our initial market research has indicated a 100% adoption rate which is unusual for any service or app, but the reasons are clear an undeniable.</p>
<p>My background in healthcare and technology will be of benefit to this project as I have both the skills and experience to get Staffer out there quickly.  Once we have Staffer in 10 sites we will very vocally, confidently and quickly make our way around the care home community via a series of talks and exhibitions.  We will visit prospects and show them real time metrics and date illustrating the instant and huge savings they can make right there by downloading  and using the app.</p>
<p>Just so that you understand, Staffer is a managed service that protects both the buyer and Nurse by completing compliance checks on all Nurses which includes PIN validation and criminal records checks.  No non compliant Nurse will ever be allowed to use Staffer.</p>
<p>To make sure we get rapid and deep market penetration we will use an outsourced call centre service to market the App directly to buyers in the private sector.</p>
<p>Nurses and other health care professionals will be encouraged by the buyers to register in order to continue working.  We will recruit more Nurses via social media activities, word of mouth, Youtube adverts and PR/news stories in relative media titles.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Staffer ia not just about saving the buyer cash, it directly impacts you in many unseen ways.  Health services and care home costs are spiralling daily due to the cost of temp agencies.  This takes money away from wards, treatments, essential services and depletes local funds.</p>
<p>It is up to you, me and anyone who is involved in Staffer in the future to turn this round and put and end to it.</p>
<p>Here are other ways you can help.</p> <ul> <li>Shout about Staffer everywhere, make sure you are heard.</li> <li>Use the power of social media to spread the word.</li>
<li>If you are a journalist or writer, create some compelling articles.</li>
<li>If you know a Nurse, get them to pre-register at staffer.healthcare.</li>
<li>If you own a care home,  pre-register at staffer.healthcare.</li>

Most of the hourly rate charged by these agencies are fees.  Some reports show that Nurses who were paid just £19 ph are being charged out at £45 ph.  The worst highligthed case being £155 ph. This is not unique to the UK, it happens everywhere including the USA, AUS, EU and it is time this travesty ended.
My name is Stephen Soos, I am the founder and CEO of Diamond Cutter Ltd which owns Staffer Healthcare.  I am developing a managed peer to peer app that connects the buyer of temp services directly to the temp Nurse.  Called Staffer and similar in paradigm to Uber.com, Staffer instantly saves the buyer and taxpayer vast sums the second it is downloaded and deployed on any smart device or PC.


Staffer decentralises the provision of temp staff and puts control directly in the hands of the Buyer and the Nurse.  All direct and hidden costs are instantly eliminated the instant Staffer is downloaded and used.
We aim to release Staffer in London in Dec 2015, quickly followed by the rest of the UK, EU and other regions in 2016/17
Staffer will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Diamond Cutter ltd in August and will make it's money by adding just £/$1 per shift hour worked to the standard pay rate of the temp worker.
Staffer Healthcare (Ltd) is a social business.  That's the same as a normal business because it will make money, pay it's taxes and a fair working wage, but ALL net profits go to saving lives of patients in the developing world via our partner www.watsi.org, and to educating Dr's, Nurses, Dentists etc via our partner www.watchmego.org.
Unlike donating to charity, your money will be used to create a sustainable and profitable business that acts as a conduit of continuous funds for the above life changing crowdfunding sites.  Staffer massively reduces the burden on the tax payer and remove the carbon dumped annually into the atmosphere by 1000's of temp agencies around the world. 
In summary your donation will:-
 Save the tax payer £/$bn's pa.
Save lives in developing countries by paying directly for medical care. 
Dramatically reduce the cost of health care service provision.
Help educate 1,000's of Dr's, Nurses, Dentist etc. Removes the hidden admin costs of hiring temps.
Gives the Nurse and buyer instant control and removes the middle man.  Staffer is a highly disruptive technology that makes agencies obsolete and has an instant dramatic and far reaching impact on our wallets, lives, planet.     What We Need & What You Get I have funded the initial planning and development and need a further £100,000 to finish the app, hire a small team and deploy Staffer inside the M25 in Dec 2015.  Here is where funds will be used.  £30,000 to finish the Staffer
£12,000 to hire outbound call centre for 3 months £6,000 for exhibition stand
£40,000 for initial marketing 
£8,000 to set up small office
£4,000 contingency 
If we don't reach our goal we will use whatever is raised to fund the above in order of importance and go to traditional funding sources for more, which is our plan once Staffer is deployed and making money.
You get my word that I will never take a basic wage or dividend payment from this project and will find a board of self made philanthropists who will do the same.  We will pay Managers and staff a fair wage to make Staffer a success.
For every single donation of £100 we will give you a gift card of £5 to use on waste.org so that you can experience the joy of reaching out in fellowship and saving someones life.  For every cumulative £100 donated we will choose a patient on Watsi.org and donate £5.   The Impact Of Your Donation If you give £1 to a charity, that money has gone, it is used up.  if you donate to make Staffer a reality that £1 is multiplied many times by the money making activities of the company.  It makes that £1 reach out into the future again and again.
Take time to look at wasti.org and watchmego.org and experience how the people behind these organisations are positively impacting the lives of so many of our brothers and sisters in the places where it is needed.  I invite you to be part of this for a one time donation.
Staffer Healthcare takes the waste of outrageous agency fees and gives it back to  you, the tax payer.  Staffer makes a fair usage charge that is used exclusively to positively impact as many lives as possible on a continuing basis.
I have the experience and network to make Staffer the huge success that it deserves and is destined to be.
I am building Staffer on the principles of oneness and fairness.  I am following the examples given to the world by Mohammad Yunus by creating a sustainable business that exists for the benefit of all of us instead of its own interests.  
Staffer will play its part in fuelling the shift from the old industrial business model to the conscious value creating business model that is emerging and connecting us in new exciting ways.  Staffer is your opportunity to contribute and impact the future in a pervasive and powerful way.
You can see just how powerful watsi.org is by taking a look at the contribution page of my other business interests.
When a patient is funded on watsi.org the donator receives an email once the treatment has been delivered, it looks like this and is a joy to receive in your inbox at the end of a hard day.







Marchelie's treatment was a success!
Marchelie, the baby girl from Haiti whose healthcare you funded on Watsi, received surgery to repair the defect in her heart. “During surgery,… Read More »

   Risks & Challenges The biggest challenge is to get to market before anyone else does, and I am sure I am not the only one thinking  along the lines of Staffer.  However, I believe that this risk is mitigated by the social nature of Staffer and all that will use it and be part of the value chain.
This kind of technology is more or less ""off the shelf"" these days.  The success of this project lies in the deployment.  We will adopt a similar city by city approach that Uber.com used in it's early days.  We will focus initially on the small care home operator who is being squeezed by regulation and high costs, who will instantly experience the benefit to their business and clients.
Our initial market research has indicated a 100% adoption rate which is unusual for any service or app, but the reasons are clear an undeniable.
My background in healthcare and technology will be of benefit to this project as I have both the skills and experience to get Staffer out there quickly.  Once we have Staffer in 10 sites we will very vocally, confidently and quickly make our way around the care home community via a series of talks and exhibitions.  We will visit prospects and show them real time metrics and date illustrating the instant and huge savings they can make right there by downloading  and using the app.
Just so that you understand, Staffer is a managed service that protects both the buyer and Nurse by completing compliance checks on all Nurses which includes PIN validation and criminal records checks.  No non compliant Nurse will ever be allowed to use Staffer.
To make sure we get rapid and deep market penetration we will use an outsourced call centre service to market the App directly to buyers in the private sector.
Nurses and other health care professionals will be encouraged by the buyers to register in order to continue working.  We will recruit more Nurses via social media activities, word of mouth, Youtube adverts and PR/news stories in relative media titles.
    Other Ways You Can Help Staffer ia not just about saving the buyer cash, it directly impacts you in many unseen ways.  Health services and care home costs are spiralling daily due to the cost of temp agencies.  This takes money away from wards, treatments, essential services and depletes local funds.
It is up to you, me and anyone who is involved in Staffer in the future to turn this round and put and end to it.
Here are other ways you can help.  Shout about Staffer everywhere, make sure you are heard. Use the power of social media to spread the word.
If you are a journalist or writer, create some compelling articles.
If you know a Nurse, get them to pre-register at staffer.healthcare.
If you own a care home,  pre-register at staffer.healthcare.
If you are a designer and want to help, get in touch.
If you are a web designer with a tendency toward philanthropy, help.
If you have any experience that would help, get in touch.
Get everyone you know to donate £1
Can you give us 10 hours of telephone canvassing to buyers ?
Are you an FD who will work on this with me for nothing ?
Are you a marketing guru with some time to commit FOC ?
Are you a celeb who wants to get behind this powerful project ?   Come with me right now and let's save a million lives, reduce our tax burdens, future our planet and be part of the Shift.www.staffer.healthcare",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div><p>Salma is born
by our own experiencie facing natural disasters in Chile. In recent years our
country and much of the planet has been plagued by a great quantity of
earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, forest fires, and other situations
that have threaten the lives of millions of people.</p>
<p>The
consequences during and after these events are:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Thousands
of people missing or dead, found days, weeks or even months after the disaster,
creating suffering and concern of families, friends, and a whole country.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>High
monetary costs and reaction times to be assumed by governments.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Authorities
and rescue agencies do not have reliable and precise information, facing twice
the difficulties to search for missing persons.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Thousands
of volunteers working on debris removal and search of missing persons.</p>
<p>Therefore,
we are developing our technology platform called Salma, whereby we wish to give
a simple and efficient tool to provide users with prevention and aid in a
disaster case.</p>
<p><b>How we will make it possible?</b></p>
<p><b>Technology Platform:</b></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Our
platform will generate a database on Web servers, powered by a mobile
application installed on each user device.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>When the
app is installed, each user generates its matrix of priority contacts; family,
friends or others, to which the application notifies massively when the user
needs help.</p>
<p><b>Operation:</b></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>With just
shaking your Smartphone , each user can access the ""panic button""
Salma , from which they can send a signal ""early warning"" massively
and automaticly , enabling open communication with your family or friends to a
possible catastrophe .</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Each user
belonging to the matrix of contacts from which the alarm has been activated has
then received a preventive message stating name and geographical location of the
person who sent the alarm.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Users who
send alert, are integrated and categorized in our database as ""possible
victims"" and if this condition persists over time, the system switches to alert
conditions to generate search and rescue actions by the relevant agencies.</p>
<p><b>Characteristics:</b></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Salma
delivers early information on the areas that are being affected by a disaster,
with individual data for each user, your geo-location and status. Being able to
provide timely information to rescuers.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Salma can
contribute to peace and calm in the population, to have information and direct
channels with those who are affected, if the communications conditions permit.</p>
<p><b>Salma always acts in two ways:</b></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Prevention:
indicates the geographic location of the person sending the message early
warning, which is not associated with a requirement necessary relief and rescue,
but if timely notification to avoid a tragedy. <i>""Salma function is not to provide advance notice of any natural event.
Salma function is to keep connecting and locatable people during a natural
event"".</i></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Assistance:
to indicate that the person requires rescue help. The person can be with or
without communication ( disappeared).</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449973493/ptguzgi1fnxkz0iiimeq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>What we need and what you get:</b></p>
<p>We need
to raise US $ 80,000 to pay what we need develop of our mobile application,
cover the maintenance of the Web server where is hosted our database and pay
for the maintenance and operation of the system for at least two years since
its launch.</p>
<p>By our
tradition and humanitarian values​​, the development of this system has a
strong social character, however funding is needed to allow the system to
operate or work with technological resources to ensure its operation worldwide,
for that reason we need charge a price of only US $ 0.50 to each user to
download Salma the first year, and from the second year of using the system,
that the user pays an annuity of US $ 0.75.</p>
<p>The money
raised will allow us to continue developing new features.</p>
<p>The
success generated by our project , is something we want to share it with the
community who provided donations in this way, and we believe that it is
possible to distribute 30 % of the profits from product sales among donor
people , so as not to deviate from our main objective is humanitarian aid. The
amount collected by the way of 30 % will be distributed in the amount donated
equivalence. Also, when we complete our development, we send each contributor,
our system Salma absolutely free, to be the first privileged users who can use
our system worldwide.</p>
<p><b>If you can not contribute money ,
don´t worry:</b></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>We will
be equally happy if you help us to spread our project.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>We
receive happy all your feedback to improve our technological development.</p>
<p>We look
forward to the full support of the Indiegogo community to fulfill our goal.</p>
<p>If we can
not possibly collect all the funds, which we achieve also raise will allow us
to advance in the first version of our limited project but running at low
levels.</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>Be part of the Salma community and help us to help:</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>By
participating with your donation or spreading our project, you will be part of
a community that will allow us to prevent the loss of life in the world to
natural disasters, who daily continue to spread to different latitudes of the
planet.</p>
<p>The Salma
project is integrated  by a team of
social entrepreneurs. In our beginings we develop programs to help poor
students , providing them with support and integration into the workplace. We
were supported by the incubator Socialab social projects , they helped us to
lead a proposal that marked positive changes in the lives of many young people
with dreams of improvement, but with limited economic resources.</p>
<p>We hope
that the great community Indiegogo support us with their donations and those
who can not contribute money , can support our project spreading the word, only
this way will raise the funds we need. As a team Salma send them a big hug.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449973756/yq7qvk9hhk5txg9hz2kc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449973779/l8hpyis9vucjpbqekaxc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p></div>","Salma is born

We need
to raise US $ 80,000 to pay what we need develop of our mobile application,
cover the maintenance of the Web server where is hosted our database and pay
for the maintenance and operation of the system for at least two years since
its launch.
By our
tradition and humanitarian values​​, the development of this system has a
strong social character, however funding is needed to allow the system to
operate or work with technological resources to ensure its operation worldwide,
for that reason we need charge a price of only US $ 0.50 to each user to
download Salma the first year, and from the second year of using the system,
that the user pays an annuity of US $ 0.75.
The money
raised will allow us to continue developing new features.
The
success generated by our project , is something we want to share it with the
community who provided donations in this way, and we believe that it is
possible to distribute 30 % of the profits from product sales among donor
people , so as not to deviate from our main objective is humanitarian aid. The
amount collected by the way of 30 % will be distributed in the amount donated
equivalence. Also, when we complete our development, we send each contributor,
our system Salma absolutely free, to be the first privileged users who can use
our system worldwide.
If you can not contribute money ,
don´t worry:
· 
We will
be equally happy if you help us to spread our project.
· 
We
receive happy all your feedback to improve our technological development.
We look
forward to the full support of the Indiegogo community to fulfill our goal.
If we can
not possibly collect all the funds, which we achieve also raise will allow us
to advance in the first version of our limited project but running at low
levels.Be part of the Salma community and help us to help:

By
participating with your donation or spreading our project, you will be part of
a community that will allow us to prevent the loss of life in the world to
natural disasters, who daily continue to spread to different latitudes of the
planet.
The Salma
project is integrated  by a team of
social entrepreneurs. In our beginings we develop programs to help poor
students , providing them with support and integration into the workplace. We
were supported by the incubator Socialab social projects , they helped us to
lead a proposal that marked positive changes in the lives of many young people
with dreams of improvement, but with limited economic resources.
We hope
that the great community Indiegogo support us with their donations and those
who can not contribute money , can support our project spreading the word, only
this way will raise the funds we need. As a team Salma send them a big hug.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","What kind of Guerrilla is this?


Our answer to you is simple. It's a funky one.Funky Guerrilla is the brand of one of the first clothing social enterprises in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The company is completely owned by Udruženje Most, a non-profit association based in the Municipality of Gradiška which works in the local community following the principles of tolerance, solidarity and sustainable development.





The Funky Guerrilla clothing is more than a brand, it is a way to generate employment opportunities and income and to invest that money where it is needed the most - in different community projects implemented by Association Most. 


Funky Guerrilla is the way to dress you have always been waiting for: hand tailored items with a unique design developed by the creative Guerrilla team.  Hoodies, T-shirts and dresses that put together local competencies and high quality materials! 

Guerrilla MissionSince 2009, all of the projects implemented by ""Most"" were oriented towards local youth and children and have been shaped by one clear mission: providing opportunities and making new generations of active citizens. Together with many volunteers, we have developed numerous local and international youth and environmental projects. Recently, we have started to provide social service in terms of preventive work with children coming from families with different social problems. We help them integrate, regardless of their background, and become aware of their rights and that they are equal, while at the same time we teach them to learn and to respect other people as well as the environment they live in.
In 2013 the team started the initiative to work on youth employment - a burning issue in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 2014 the idea to make a social enterprise and create jobs through establishing a local production facilities and creating a totally new clothing brand came true. Now Funky Guerrilla employs 6 people and has the capacity to grow even more with your support.





How the Guerrilla works

In being a social enterprise we are putting our focus on two main pillars of our work: the first being to keep on maintaining a sustainable and profitable business and  the second to use the profits we gain not for our personal good, but to invest in community work and social services that we find extremely important.
When we created Funky Guerrilla, we decided to reinvest the 50% of the profit in the production, which can enable the job opportunities for more people and improve our facility and products, and other 50% in the activities we are carrying on in Most, developing new project or enhancing the ones we already have. In other words, we are trying to face the high level of unemployment that affects BiH and we invest what we get from the business for the good of the community.



What do you do with my money and what do I get?!
#SupportGuerrilla is a campaign with a clear mission: with your support we want to raise 21.000$ to invest in our social enterprise in order to create 3 new permanent job opportunities in Funky Guerrilla production facilities for women coming from the rural area, and with spreading Funky Guerrilla to a wider market in Bosnia and Herzegovina and potentially even beyond. Consequently, this investment will help us gain a higher income which will again invest in creating even more job opportunities and a stable financial support for our community activities.

The Perks







 
We have developed a clear road-map of where we want to go with Funky Guerrilla and the investment we get. We want to provide more job opportunities, we want Funky Guerrilla to spread across Bosnia and Herzegovina, and we go over the top of our goal we will also directly invest in social services we provide. 


Yeah, nice. But why should I care?

What comes to your mind when you think about Bosnia? War, ethnic hatreds, poverty? Well, twenty years after the end of the conflict, the idea you have in mind might not be that right. Even though several problems are still affecting our country - primarily unemployment - the Guerrilla decided ages ago to move forward and to invest in the future generations, trying to make things better.  Our Guerrilla doesn’t care about your background, ethnicity or religion. Everybody is welcome. We believe that diversity is the base for any good social change. The connections we have been able to build between people here are based on solidarity, respect and cooperation, and not on religion, ethnicity or some other reasons politicians like to claim. Regardless of the level of involvement and knowledge you have of the Bosnian context, we can tell you that the most important challenge we’re facing here, right now, is unemployment - and that is why we need your help!



That is also the reason why, two years ago, we decide to set up our own clothing production, Funky Guerrilla. Becoming a social enterprise gave us the opportunity to employ young people from the area and to improve our contribution in local community regarding job creation and to build a completely new brand that would be the carrier of positive rebellion in the community. We employ young women coming from rural areas and, in other words, while we produce our Guerrilla clothes, we work on creating new forms of sociability in our local community.




What the Guerrilla exactly does for the community? 


As already stated, we contribute to our community in several ways:
Dnevni centar ""Gnijezdo"" - the Nest Center
Our nest Center. Here we provide daily assistance and preventive work with children coming from families with different social problems. Since last year we are carrying out a set of well planned activities aimed at strengthening their integrity and awareness, helping them to reach the formal education goals that they deserve and developing their social skills. You can follow the activities of the Nest Center by clicking here. 



Local Voluntary Service
Since its establishment ""Most"" is running the Local Voluntary Service, a network of young people who actively cooperate with other non-governmental organizations and public institutions and are willing to help in making good things happen. All of our volunteers - more than 300 - are enrolled in a database where they are ready to respond to the needs of the local community. So far they have provided voluntary services that reached over 10.000 beneficiaries in the local community. 


Budi Muško Klub - Be a Man Club

Be a Man Club is the free space where high school students can freely use their creativity and skills, as well as they are capable to share their thoughts and concerns. It is a regular activity which gives members the opportunity to confront and talk to each other, but more importantly, it is the place where they activate themselves as citizens,  working to spread awareness of real life values and learning that violence and destructiveness is a virtue of the weak. More info available here.

Mobility projects 

The relation our association has with the world of mobility project goes back to the beginning of our NGO experience. We believe that having an international experience and meeting people from different countries can also change young people for the better. That is the reason why we participated in more than 30 mobility projects sending more than 100 people abroad to share knowledge, experiences, skills and friendship with their peers from all around Europe. We have used the European mobility opportunities to do this and now we are the organization in charge of the ERASMUS+ “Social Entrepreneurship for Social Changes” (2016-2017) project developed together with different organizations from 12 European countries. 


A space for non-formal learning
We have created a space where non-formal learning happens on an everyday basis. From guitar and music lessons, language courses, environmental workshops end festivals, to film screenings, exchange of goods, various creative workshops on how to produce and recycle things, etc. You name we had it.",13.0,1,"1 Campaign

We are preparing to open a New Distillery & Grand Tasting Salon.
Our second location will offer behind the scenes distillery tours, specialty craft spirits tastings, a cocktail bar, and cocktail crafting classes.

Napa Valley Distillery stands for community, craft spirits, education, friendship, and fun.
We believe that great spirits and cocktails create community and you, our customers, are why have stuck with it! Our goal is to create new experiences where people feel as connected to us, and to our products, as they do to one another.

Our Origin Story
We Are The First, And Only, Distillery In Napa Since Prohibition

After working as a limo driver, a Vegas stick man, and life insurance salesman, Napa Valley Distillery founder and front man Arthur Hartunian began Napa Valley Limoncello Company over a Poker bet!
Long story short, NV Limoncello Company grew into Napa Valley Distillery and in 2014 we launched the first legal craft spirits tasting salon in California.
Arthur is also one of the founding members of the California Artisanal Distillers Guild which protects and enhances the rights of all CA craft distilleries.

A Bit More About Us...We Are Full Of SPIRIT!

Together we are: Arthur & Lulu Hartunian (Founders/CEO), Ian Winget (Marketing), and Paul Martin (Brand Ambassador), Shel Strickland (Girl Friday), Zach Lafaille & Tim Espinoza (Distillers), Amanda Mizirawi & Beth Martin (Bar Club Support), Theodore Alexander & Tim Johnston (Bar Shop Staff), and Carlos Sac (Production).
From a family of five to a staff of 12; Arthur and Lulu Hartunian have spent the last eight years of their lives building Napa Valley Distillery into a premier destination distillery for both tourists and Napa residents alike.


We are now in the final stages of our first major expansion as we build out our New Distillery and Grand Tasting Salon, and we need your contributions to finish the job.

What Have Accomplished So Far?
In Less Than A Year, We Have Gone From This:

To This:

Pretty Impressive, Isn't It?
 ?
So Why Aren't We Open Yet?
We Are Over Budget & Out Of Time
Due to many unexpected Napa City & County building requirements, we were forced to cancel our Grand Opening in January 2016 in order to begin completing those requirements. 
This meant making major changes to the structure and interior of our New Distillery and Grand Tasting Salon. These unfortunate setbacks have cost us dearly in both lost time and money and threaten to permanently inhibit our ability to complete our full expansion...
and we are SO close and have SO dang much to offer you! 
This Is Where You Come In


What Do We Need?
We Need Pennies From Heaven
Your contributions, passion, and excitement are indispensable to the completion and launch of our new Distillery. We are thrilled for you to join the Napa Valley Distillery Family!
We are seeking $35,000 to complete several vital building requirements including:

 
Fire Sprinklers: $10K – Fire Department Mandated
Trash Shed: $5K - City Mandated
Tanks: $5K - For increased production and efficiency
Private Tasting Lounge: $5K - For our Indiegogo Contributors & Club Members
Final Touches: $10K - On several existing construction projects
Any extra funds we raise will go towards job creation.
This will allow us to create new products and customer experiences for YOU!

What Do You Get In Addition To Our Gratitude?
Awe Inspiring Perks Of Course!

We are so excited about the Perks* that we are offering to our contributors. From a private tour and tasting with our founder Arthur Hartunian, bottles of spirits, a sample box from our Bar Club, Membership to our Bar Club to a full barrel of spirits for your enjoyment! There’s really no better way to become part of our revolutionary Distillery than by getting one of these Perks* through your Indiegogo contribution. The time is nigh and the clock is ticking.
Oh boy, if we don’t reach our goal of $35,000, all the monies we do receive will go towards completing these projects. Without your contribution, it will take us much, much longer to complete them; if we can complete them at all.

The Impact Of Our Campaign

We are excited to share all that the New Distillery & Grand Tasting Salon have to offer with you and other guests.
The success of this project is of paramount importance for Arthur, Lulu, and the entire NVD Family,  as we have struggled, toiled, and given our blood, sweat, and tears for the past year, trying to finish our expansion.
Napa Valley Distillery is our life, but this project has a greater impact.
Here is how we contribute to our community:
Job Creation: As a small business on the verge of a huge growth spurt, Napa Valley Distillery plans on doubling the number of employees in 2017 and possibly again in 2018.
Supporting Local Economy: NVD supports the local economy by spending tens of thousands of dollars each year in Napa, and throughout California.
Supporting Small Businesses: NVD’s retail operation supports hundreds of small business that produce the products that we sell. We are the largest bricks-and-mortar retailer of hand-crafted cocktail bitters, syrups, mixers, and shrubs in the US.

Risks & Challenges
The main risk for our company if we do not achieve our Indiegogo Project Goal is that it could take so long to complete each of our individual projects that the current rent of our new Distillery will cause our company to drastically slow down.
We have achieved so much since our humble beginnings, and our new distillery is the culmination of years of planning and hard work.

We Need You! Yes, YOU!
Here Are Other Ways You Can Help

<p>Grannys Attic Treasures is a small mom and pop retro shop on Ottawa Street in Hamilton. We are now in our 8th  year and still loving every minute of it. We hunt out and find the most unique retro items, whether it's a 50's kitchen set, tree trunk coffee tables, funky lights, gorgeous vintage crystal and even suitcase end tables. If it's different, we will sell it. We LOVE retro. The 1950's to the 80's are our favourite time period and we have discovered over the years, you all love and loved those years as well. </p>
<p>Sadly our 15 year old truck   desperately   needs either major work or to be replaced. In the past 6 months we have had her in for numerous repairs that have required towing, including our last breakdown as we were getting onto the highway and the Upper ball joint and tire rod broke. Very scary.  With the long rough winter, we simply cannot afford the full cost of major repairs on our 15 year old truck nor the full cost to replace it. So we are humbly asking for your help.</p>
<p>     So that we can continue to safely travel to our destinations for our stock we come to you, our wonderful customers and friends for help. Gil has his eyes on a full size cargo van but in order for us to get it, we really do need your help. The new to us truck will still be used, after all, a store selling treasures such as ours couldn't drive a new vehicle. lol  But it will be newer, safer and much more reliable. <br/>We are hoping to raise $3500.00 towards it with your help. </p>
<p><br/>Your donation will NOT go unrewarded. Each and all donations will receive a Grannys Attic Treasures gift certificate for the exact same amount of your donation. Pretty cool right? </p>
<p> Your gift certificate can be used at any time on any item and any balance will be recorded for future purchases. Also for our out of town donations  we will gladly mail you a gift certificate .</p>
<p>We know we have the best customers and we are hoping you can all help us out  during this time so we can continue our awesome hunts to bring you, our wonderful customers, the cool retro and unique pieces of furniture, glassware, lighting , art  and just about anything different that  we can hunt out.  We also would like to thank you all for your constant support  and please know that this was and is a very difficult thing for us to have to do.  We know times are tough for so many of you so any donation amount will be appreciated.  Please share this and help us reach our goal. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </span><br/></p>
