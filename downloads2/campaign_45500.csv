<h1><b>Letter of the founder:</b></h1>
<p><i>"" Due to my family tradition and despite my 160 cm´s I started playing basketball in my backyard when I was only 7. After more than 20 years playing basketball, I still can’t dunk ;) but it has been a key guide to my principles and values: happiness and learning continuously. Sports has the power to change, and today it has brought us here to bring an oasis of joy to the desert for kids that are born in the Sahara and don’t have the opportunity to find those guides to overcome everyday obstacles. A shoe should do something more than just cover pretty feet. That is why MMARTINYCA has joined quality and comfort, without forgetting fashion, with a clear purpose: a conscience sustainability, where the economic benefit has the same importance as the benefits for people and Nature. </i></p>
<p><i>We have designed this special collection to start building on sand. I hope you like it and enjoy helping create this dream in the desert! </i></p>

For each pair of Martinyca’s you order, we will recycle one wheel to make your soles and you will also be donating another wheel to build the basketball court in the desert for the kids.

Reward ""Pack Jugon"": In addition, we have set up a limited edition gift just for our launch on Kickstarter. For each order made, one mini basketball ball will go to the kids in Africa. This ball is perfect for daily use and matches our #JugonessobreRuedas values.

After the process we have a elastic base granule gauge ranges from o,5 to 1,5 mm of rubber from recycled tires that confers better elasticity to the turf and it ´s mixed with a special polyurethane agglutinant. It is applied with a special spreader machine that is Planomatic, leveler and compacter with a vibrating and self-heating ruler.

And it will look like This!:

HOW MANY WHEELS DO WE NEED? / ¿CUANTAS RUEDAS NECESITAMOS ?
Each wheel covers 0,2 m2 of flat surface of the basketball court. To cover 300 m2 for 1 Basketball court we will need 1.500 wheels.

DRIVING AN OASIS OF JOY IN THE DESERT 

We Respect for the balance of desert ecosystem. The basketball court will be a green oasis built 100% on recycled materials, respecting the environment, while offering the kids and future generations a durable and resistant magical place be happy and play.
Menorca, Balearic Islands, Spain

 
      
THE ART OF CRAFT: A POPULAR PROCESS THAT WE KEEP INTACT.
All Martinycas are Exclusively Reinvented with the real recyled wheel´s car. 150 Footwear factories closed last year only in the Balearic Islands, (Menorca) due to the presence of ""low-cost"" fashion and the entrance of Asian market, where the value of handmade footwear has been lost. We are proud to say that we make our Martinycas as nobody no longer does. First, we follow an artisan statement that keeps a tradition alive that we are loosing in Spain.

 

Small changes can make a big difference, that`s why we let you know all the details...



THE HIDEN SECRET OF THE HEEL STRAP 
The strap must be  made of real tire. The key to remain in place

The real tire never lost elasticity .The strap is made of  tire, reinforced with leather and is the only way to deal with perfect-fitting abarcas.

Letter of the founder:
"" Due to my family tradition and despite my 160 cm´s I started playing basketball in my backyard when I was only 7. After more than 20 years playing basketball, I still can’t dunk ;) but it has been a key guide to my principles and values: happiness and learning continuously. Sports has the power to change, and today it has brought us here to bring an oasis of joy to the desert for kids that are born in the Sahara and don’t have the opportunity to find those guides to overcome everyday obstacles. A shoe should do something more than just cover pretty feet. That is why MMARTINYCA has joined quality and comfort, without forgetting fashion, with a clear purpose: a conscience sustainability, where the economic benefit has the same importance as the benefits for people and Nature. 
We have designed this special collection to start building on sand. I hope you like it and enjoy helping create this dream in the desert! 
Many Thanks for the support! María

<p>What would we do with $50,000?  MAKE A LOT OF NOISE!  Focused, targeted, broad and far-reaching, all over the planet!  We’d really get the word out!  MOOD WATCH!</p>
<p>Hi. My name is Kimberly Knox. I am an inventor, and it just so happens that I also have Bipolar I.</p>
<p>Not long ago I was sitting in the art room of a psychiatric hospital at about 4:00 a.m.  Again. Crazy, right?  You bet, and at the time, nothing weighed heavier on my mind than figuring out what I could do about this condition once and for all.</p>
<p>I decided to begin tracking my different moods so I could understand myself better. I assembled five colored pencils and a notebook and began creating charts that tracked how I felt, my blood pressure and pulse before and after meditating, my sleep patterns and changes in medications. Day after day I kept track of all of this information with the hope that one day I would better understand how my mind was functioning.</p>
<p> <img alt=""Original Chart"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/683022/pictures/original/20130228084552-chart.JPG?1362071373"" src="""" style="""" title=""Kim's Original Hospital Chart""/></p>
<p><em>One of my original hospital charts.</em></p>
<p>Charting all of this information three times each day took an enormous amount of time and energy. I knew there had to be an easier way. That’s when I began thinking:</p>
<p>“<em>What if I were to create a quick and precise way to size myself up mentally, emotionally and physically throughout the day? What if I could create reminders to take my medications and supplements?  And what if I could accurately chart all of this information – including how I was feeling, sleeping and meditating for my personal reflection, or to share with my physician or therapist? This might help me start to pull my life together.”</em></p>
<p>With the help of two brilliant program developers – Adam Harris and Carson Whitsett of Ditty Labs – I put all of these ideas into a new mobile app available on the iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad, and Android devices called Mood Watch. Endorsed by the <a href=""http://www.internationalbipolarfoundation.org/)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">International Bipolar Foundation</a>, Mood Watch empowers people who have mood disorders (like me) with tools that can help them live happier and more productive lives.</p>

<p>And better still, Mood Watch isn’t just for the few who are very sick, but for the many who have a depression that hangs on a little too heavily and for too long, for anxiety that unsteadies the hand and a feeling of an unnamed uneasiness that colors whole days—chalked up to “normal” when we know it’s not.  Poor feelings we have no words for, we just don’t feel right even though nothing’s really wrong.  Mood Watch is perfect for a whole lot of us.</p>

<p>Mood Watch makes it simple to keep track of how you’re feeling throughout the day so you can better understand your mood patterns. It also makes it easier to have a proactive discussion with your doctor or therapist about the unique feelings you’ve experienced between office visits.</p>
<p><strong>Here's how it works:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When you wake up in the morning you evaluate your overall feeling, mark the number of hours you slept and the quality of your sleep.</li>
<li>Next, take your blood pressure and pulse with a wrist monitor. We recommend a wrist monitor which costs about $18. It’s worth every penny, and the measurements lend a powerful biofeedback aspect to the program.</li>
<li>After you take your blood pressure and pulse we advise you to meditate for 3 - 5 minutes before taking your blood pressure and pulse again. If you don't notice a difference before and after, you will with a bit of practice. Over time you will become calmer and you'll find that your body will remain calmer (with practice) even when your mind might be a few steps ahead.</li>
<li>Next, with Mood Watch you will begin constructing your chart.  By sliding buttons into place, you are able to rate your levels of anxiety, your overall mood, level of calmness, focus and/or mindfulness and energy on a scale of negative 5 to positive 5.  You’ll see these patterns immediately reflected in the weekly view. And each of these categories are fully customizable.  For example, just tap on the word, ""calm"" and change it to ""joy"" if you'd like to track this emotion instead.</li>
<li>If you have specific details about your day that you'd like to record, you can add personal notes describing your morning, afternoon and evening.  These notes can be particularly valuable in interpreting your chart later.</li>
<li>Clicking on the Report icon at any time during the week will allow you to examine all the information you’ve recorded. These beautiful and easy-to-read reports can be used for your personal reference, or emailed to your physician or therapist for discussion during your next office visit.</li>
<li>Mood Watch also offers you the ability to enter the names of the supplements or medications you are taking so you can track whether you're following your regimen as planned or as directed by your physician.</li>
<li>For more general information, the Info button provides general information about the app, an ""Alarms"" button to serve as a reminder to chart your overall well being, and a ""Feedback button to share your Mood Watch experience. It’s that simple.</li>
</ul><p>Here’s what people are saying about Mood Watch: <em><br/><br/> ""I want to applaud you for your giant undertaking in terms of understanding the connection between internal reactions and their affect on mood and our body systems.  Something I have been trying to achieve for decades.  It looks like you are doing a great service.  I totally enjoyed working with it."" <br/> Dr. L.</em></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p class=""FieldSubsidiary"">Whenever I say that I am going to be commencing my PhD in War Studies, I am always asked why I like to study something as terrible as war. My response is always the same, “Peace cannot be kept by force, it can only be achieved by understanding.”</p>
<p class=""FieldSubsidiary"">While Einstein had a slightly different context in mind for this statement, I have adopted it to the belief that by understanding conflict, and the root causes of it, we can find new innovative ways to approach, manage and prevent it. In the case of my research, this will be done by focusing on and promoting the unique and positive role that women in politics can play in addressing critical human security issues, and the important link this has to managing and preventing hard security issues (ex. terrorism).</p>
<p class=""FieldSubsidiary"">In September 2013, I will begin my PhD at King's College in London, UK, in the Department of War Studies and am raising funding for this research and field work. This department is considered the best in the world for its field, and the university itself in the top 20. More importantly than just the research, I aim to prove the many practical benefits gained by bringing more women to the political table and show what positive impact this can have in ensuring more stable and secure societies, as well as publish my findings and contributing to the larger policy discussion so we can find more hand-ons ways to get women involved. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I am a journalist, researcher and project manager that has lived and worked across the globe. My international work and volunteer experience around the world, as well as my academic research into the topic of women’s political participation undertaken in my undergraduate and graduate studies, has proven that there can be significant benefits to states experiencing conflict or security concerns that ensure the inclusion of women in significant political roles. These expand far beyond the idea of ‘fairness’ and universal human rights and include economic stability, a focus on key devlopment issues (such as education, food security and health care) and unique approaches to issues of human and state security. A full thesis outline can be found under Gallery - Files. This idea was initially sparked by the touching story of a woman named Consolée Mukanyiligira I interviewed in Rwanda for my first documentary, who following the genocide was finishing her law degree while raising twelve children (six of which were not her own) and was focused on promoting reconciliation and moving her country forward. Her insipirational story, as well as other similiar interviews and research of countries such as Turkey, Palestine, Mozambique and Yemen, which led to my meeting Nobel Peace Prize winner Tawakkol Karman in 2011, the importance of this topic has only increased.</p>
<p>My predominant motivation behind this research is to show why women’s political representation is imperative for the long-term economic advancement, security and stabilization of not only countries experiencing high levels of conflict, but how this is also relevent to our own backyards. Having come from the crime capital of Canada, where some of our own rates of poverty and violence match those in former conflict zones, this research is as relevent to managing security at home as it is to the countries which we are helping to secure. This is a topic I have dedicated many years of my life to and am now making this a full-time research and career focus. </p>
<p>My research was also promoted in a recent <a href=""http://www.leaderpost.com/explore+women+political+participation+with+Cook/8770778/story.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Leader Post article</a> and also had UN Women's Watch ( <a href=""https://twitter.com/UNWomenWatch/favorites"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://twitter.com/UNWomenWatch/favorites</a> ) favourite me on Twitter. I have also had support from Deputy Leader to the Liberal Party Ralph Goodale as well as CBC 'Q's Jian Ghomeshi. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>What I Need and What You Get</h3>
<p></p>
<p>I aim to raise $21,877.53, for this research. This will help cover a fraction of the costs related to my research, fieldwork in Mali and Yemen and related expenses. To give an idea of the cost of research, by the time I will have completed this project, I will have spent over $100,000 on tuition alone (largely self-funded and excluding living and travel expenses). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have already contributed articles to international publications as well as done presentations for government bodies, such as the Ministry of Social Services. As such, I am offering some 'perks' for donations, which you can see on the top right of the screen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your support, even $10 or $20, will help bring voice to a critical topic that currently has little voice in the policy field. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> 
</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p> </p>

Whenever I say that I am going to be commencing my PhD in War Studies, I am always asked why I like to study something as terrible as war. My response is always the same, “Peace cannot be kept by force, it can only be achieved by understanding.”
While Einstein had a slightly different context in mind for this statement, I have adopted it to the belief that by understanding conflict, and the root causes of it, we can find new innovative ways to approach, manage and prevent it. In the case of my research, this will be done by focusing on and promoting the unique and positive role that women in politics can play in addressing critical human security issues, and the important link this has to managing and preventing hard security issues (ex. terrorism).
In September 2013, I will begin my PhD at King's College in London, UK, in the Department of War Studies and am raising funding for this research and field work. This department is considered the best in the world for its field, and the university itself in the top 20. More importantly than just the research, I aim to prove the many practical benefits gained by bringing more women to the political table and show what positive impact this can have in ensuring more stable and secure societies, as well as publish my findings and contributing to the larger policy discussion so we can find more hand-ons ways to get women involved. 
 
Summary
I am a journalist, researcher and project manager that has lived and worked across the globe. My international work and volunteer experience around the world, as well as my academic research into the topic of women’s political participation undertaken in my undergraduate and graduate studies, has proven that there can be significant benefits to states experiencing conflict or security concerns that ensure the inclusion of women in significant political roles. These expand far beyond the idea of ‘fairness’ and universal human rights and include economic stability, a focus on key devlopment issues (such as education, food security and health care) and unique approaches to issues of human and state security. A full thesis outline can be found under Gallery - Files. This idea was initially sparked by the touching story of a woman named Consolée Mukanyiligira I interviewed in Rwanda for my first documentary, who following the genocide was finishing her law degree while raising twelve children (six of which were not her own) and was focused on promoting reconciliation and moving her country forward. Her insipirational story, as well as other similiar interviews and research of countries such as Turkey, Palestine, Mozambique and Yemen, which led to my meeting Nobel Peace Prize winner Tawakkol Karman in 2011, the importance of this topic has only increased.
My predominant motivation behind this research is to show why women’s political representation is imperative for the long-term economic advancement, security and stabilization of not only countries experiencing high levels of conflict, but how this is also relevent to our own backyards. Having come from the crime capital of Canada, where some of our own rates of poverty and violence match those in former conflict zones, this research is as relevent to managing security at home as it is to the countries which we are helping to secure. This is a topic I have dedicated many years of my life to and am now making this a full-time research and career focus. 
My research was also promoted in a recent Leader Post article and also had UN Women's Watch ( https://twitter.com/UNWomenWatch/favorites ) favourite me on Twitter. I have also had support from Deputy Leader to the Liberal Party Ralph Goodale as well as CBC 'Q's Jian Ghomeshi. 
 
 


What I Need and What You Get

I aim to raise $21,877.53, for this research. This will help cover a fraction of the costs related to my research, fieldwork in Mali and Yemen and related expenses. To give an idea of the cost of research, by the time I will have completed this project, I will have spent over $100,000 on tuition alone (largely self-funded and excluding living and travel expenses). 
 
I have already contributed articles to international publications as well as done presentations for government bodies, such as the Ministry of Social Services. As such, I am offering some 'perks' for donations, which you can see on the top right of the screen.
 
Your support, even $10 or $20, will help bring voice to a critical topic that currently has little voice in the policy field.

The Impact
This research will play two distinct roles: helping to draw attention to two countries whose current security situations have affected and engaged countries as far away as Canada and the U.S. and also helping promote an emerging, alternative policy perspective that we can use in analyzing security approaches at home.  
Yemen and Mali are states with severe levels of poverty, high youth populations and a number of similar problems related to development, particularly in the areas of education, literacy, and health. Both countries are struggling with transitional governments and separatist movements which threaten to further destabilize the country and worse. Yemen and Mali have also both become hubs for international terrorist organizations (the latest threats by al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in August 2013 shut down embassies across the region), providing training grounds and bases from which to strike in the region and abroad creating clear and distinct threats not only within the country, but around the world. The two countries also share a number of other characteristics, such as low levels of women’s political representation. The original research within this thesis could greatly contribute to the future considerations within both countries in the areas of national security policy as well as international engagement and assistance. 
Though it may seem a world away, these two countries can also offer unique insights to us. Looking at some of the key factors currently affecting the development and stability of Mali and Yemen, we can take these countries as case studies to reflect on some of the fundamental building blocks of human security, defined as security of the individual in his or her personal surroundings, community, and environment, in our own backyard.

<p>Our planet is currently experiencing the highest levels of human displacement in history. In 2016 alone, over 65 million people were forcibly displaced worldwide. On top of that, 20 more people are displaced every single minute. Seek Refuge uses our voice and products to increase awareness around this crisis, and donates a portion of proceeds to refugee aid programs. Currently, we are working with two schools in Jordan which educate Syrian children living in refugee camps, who otherwise would not have access to education.</p>

<p>We want women to feel empowered when they wear a Seek Refuge piece. Too often, we are subjected to the stereotypes that surround us as Muslim women. It is time to dismantle those stereotypes. Our clothes are designed to allow women who practice all levels of modesty to represent their faith in a hype and fashion-forward way. Seek Refuge is edgier and more versatile than the typical modest fashion brand, so our clothes can be worn as streetwear or as modest fashion. (Because modesty is a badass choice and not a form of oppression... #wakeup.) </p>

<p>Seek Refuge combines Islamic aesthetics with American style to produce artistic, fashion forward clothing for the millennial Muslim.

<p>The Refuge Jacket is our flagship piece. It features high quality, carefully selected Turkish denim, branded vintage copper buttons, and subtle distressing. The oversized fit was meticulously designed to be both modest and edgy. This jacket is the embodiment of our mission to aid refugees. The Arabic script on the back was handwritten by a Muslim calligrapher. The poem, written by a Syrian refugee, reads:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>“Once we were at least happy. There once was peace where we resided<br/>In our land of birth; our homeland.

<p>The Search For You tee represents the spiritual journey of the Muslim woman. We guarantee that you'll want to wear it more than your other tees, which is okay because it'll outlast everything else you own. The sleeves are made with mesh, allowing the tee to breathe in all the right places, and feature a branded border. The text on it reads Seek Refuge in Arabic, while the graphic represents the journey we are all on to find God. It is a nod to the strength of women who face more obstacles and critics in their journey to find peace and balance between religion and culture, which is often just handed to their male counterparts.</p>

<p>If you didn't already know, fast fashion seriously sucks. When clothes are made quickly and cheaply, they are almost always a product of harmful labor practices and unethical sourcing. Seek Refuge is taking a stand against fast fashion by creating high quality products using an ethical and fair supply chain. We manufacture in Istanbul, Turkey, where the factories we partner with are Sedex certified, and create jobs for refugees. From production to purchase, Seek Refuge products are creating a positive impact.</p>

<p>Hi, I’m Shazia Ijaz, founder and CEO of Seek Refuge. I'm a 25 year-old Pakistani American Muslim, born and raised in Michigan. I attended the University of Michigan Ross School of Business and graduated with a BBA. After graduating, I went on to work at Poshmark, a Silicon Valley fashion-tech startup. There, I learned the ins and outs of the startup world. Unfortunately, multiple concussions from horseback riding made working regular hours extremely difficult. I realized that I would have to forge my own path, one that allowed me to take care of my health as well as fulfill my life ambitions. So, I decided to combine my love of fashion with my determination to change the world by starting Seek Refuge.</p>
<p>As a Muslim woman, I saw too few lines catering to girls like myself. There were no Islamic women’s brands which appealed to all Muslim women, who practice different levels of modesty. Furthermore, the modest fashion brands that did exist were all fairly feminine in their designs. Nothing fit the style of the fashion-forward, edgy, millennial Muslim woman. This gap inspired Seek Refuge.</p>
<p>The Seek Refuge mission was created to represent three groups that have been heavily targeted since the 2016 election: refugees, women, and Muslims. While Donald Trump was admitting fewer refugees, reinforcing misogynistic attitudes, and banning Muslims from traveling, Seek Refuge was raising awareness around these issues. Even before the brand has sold a single item, it has been able to educate people about the refugee crisis through social media marketing. </p>
<p>I hope you join our movement to change the narrative around these groups, and make a difference in refugee children's lives. Seek Refuge can't be a reality without backers like you!</p>
<p> </p>

<p>Our team is confident in our ability to fulfill your orders and bring you high quality products. But as with any new venture, things could go wrong. The funds raised are largely going to manufacturing expenses, and we have a strong relationship with an ethical manufacturer in Istanbul, Turkey. However, there could be unforeseen circumstances during production and fulfillment. If this does happen, Seek Refuge will update you accordingly so you are always in the loop. Our end goal is to deliver high-end clothing that empowers Muslim women and contributes to refugee aid. We will do everything possible to reach that goal!</p>

<p>Seek Refuge has already funded the design and development of our prototypes. For each item, we have tech packs, patterns, grading, and design files. Now, we need $20,000 to produce the collection. This includes purchasing fabrics, visiting the factory in Istanbul, refining trims, paying for production, designing packaging, and getting your orders to you. Plus, a portion of proceeds will be donated to two refugee schools in Jordan.</p>

<p><strong>Do you make men's items?</strong></p>
<p>For this campaign only, the Refuge Jacket is available in a men's style! When checking out, you'll have the option to select your style (men's vs women's) and your size (small, medium, or large). Men should select their standard t-shirt size.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you manufacture? </strong></p>
<p>We're saying no to fast fashion and unfair labor. Seek Refuge uses an ethical manufacturing facility in Istanbul, Turkey that has been certified by a non-profit organization to practice fair labor standards. Furthermore, the facility employs refugees who have resettled in Istanbul.</p>
<p><strong>How much goes to refugee aid? </strong></p>
<p>We're working hard to make the biggest impact possible on the refugee crisis. At this stage, at least 10% of our funding will be donated to refugee schools in Jordan. The more money we raise, the higher that percentage will be. Essentially, we are committed to donating all funds remaining after expenses are paid.</p>
<p><strong>Can I wear Seek Refuge if I'm not Muslim? </strong></p>
<p>Yes! We've been asked this by more than a few allies, and it is a seriously woke question. If you aren't Muslim, but consider yourself a Muslim ally or have Muslim friends, we encourage you to join our movement. Just be sure to understand the message behind the brand and the pieces before you rep!</p>
<p><strong style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Are the images on this page the final products? </strong></p>
<p>What you see on this page and in the video are prototypes, so they do not represent the final production quality. When we move to production, items will have finer details, brighter colors, and even richer fabrics. We'll update you along the way if you back this project so you know exactly what to anticipate! </p>

As Nelson Mandela said, ""Education is the  most powerful weapon which you can use to change the  world.""

The Mafraq School in Mafraq, Jordan has 100 children enrolled between the ages of 5 and 10. The Amman Senior School in Amman, Jordan has enrolled 150 pupils aged between the ages of 17 and 20, of which 27 students recently secured admission to universities and colleges. Seek Refuge funds will be used for teacher salaries, school supplies, and necessities for the students.

 

If you didn't already know, fast fashion seriously sucks. When clothes are made quickly and cheaply, they are almost always a product of harmful labor practices and unethical sourcing. Seek Refuge is taking a stand against fast fashion by creating high quality products using an ethical and fair supply chain. We manufacture in Istanbul, Turkey, where the factories we partner with are Sedex certified, and create jobs for refugees. From production to purchase, Seek Refuge products are creating a positive impact.


 

Hi, I’m Shazia Ijaz, founder and CEO of Seek Refuge. I'm a 25 year-old Pakistani American Muslim, born and raised in Michigan. I attended the University of Michigan Ross School of Business and graduated with a BBA. After graduating, I went on to work at Poshmark, a Silicon Valley fashion-tech startup. There, I learned the ins and outs of the startup world. Unfortunately, multiple concussions from horseback riding made working regular hours extremely difficult. I realized that I would have to forge my own path, one that allowed me to take care of my health as well as fulfill my life ambitions. So, I decided to combine my love of fashion with my determination to change the world by starting Seek Refuge.
As a Muslim woman, I saw too few lines catering to girls like myself. There were no Islamic women’s brands which appealed to all Muslim women, who practice different levels of modesty. Furthermore, the modest fashion brands that did exist were all fairly feminine in their designs. Nothing fit the style of the fashion-forward, edgy, millennial Muslim woman. This gap inspired Seek Refuge.
The Seek Refuge mission was created to represent three groups that have been heavily targeted since the 2016 election: refugees, women, and Muslims. While Donald Trump was admitting fewer refugees, reinforcing misogynistic attitudes, and banning Muslims from traveling, Seek Refuge was raising awareness around these issues. Even before the brand has sold a single item, it has been able to educate people about the refugee crisis through social media marketing. 
I hope you join our movement to change the narrative around these groups, and make a difference in refugee children's lives. Seek Refuge can't be a reality without backers like you!
 

Our team is confident in our ability to fulfill your orders and bring you high quality products. But as with any new venture, things could go wrong. The funds raised are largely going to manufacturing expenses, and we have a strong relationship with an ethical manufacturer in Istanbul, Turkey. However, there could be unforeseen circumstances during production and fulfillment. If this does happen, Seek Refuge will update you accordingly so you are always in the loop. Our end goal is to deliver high-end clothing that empowers Muslim women and contributes to refugee aid. We will do everything possible to reach that goal!

 

Seek Refuge has already funded the design and development of our prototypes. For each item, we have tech packs, patterns, grading, and design files. Now, we need $20,000 to produce the collection. This includes purchasing fabrics, visiting the factory in Istanbul, refining trims, paying for production, designing packaging, and getting your orders to you. Plus, a portion of proceeds will be donated to two refugee schools in Jordan.

 

Do you make men's items?
For this campaign only, the Refuge Jacket is available in a men's style! When checking out, you'll have the option to select your style (men's vs women's) and your size (small, medium, or large). Men should select their standard t-shirt size.
Where do you manufacture? 
We're saying no to fast fashion and unfair labor. Seek Refuge uses an ethical manufacturing facility in Istanbul, Turkey that has been certified by a non-profit organization to practice fair labor standards. Furthermore, the facility employs refugees who have resettled in Istanbul.
How much goes to refugee aid? 
We're working hard to make the biggest impact possible on the refugee crisis. At this stage, at least 10% of our funding will be donated to refugee schools in Jordan. The more money we raise, the higher that percentage will be. Essentially, we are committed to donating all funds remaining after expenses are paid.
Can I wear Seek Refuge if I'm not Muslim? 
Yes! We've been asked this by more than a few allies, and it is a seriously woke question. If you aren't Muslim, but consider yourself a Muslim ally or have Muslim friends, we encourage you to join our movement. Just be sure to understand the message behind the brand and the pieces before you rep!
Are the images on this page the final products? 
What you see on this page and in the video are prototypes, so they do not represent the final production quality. When we move to production, items will have finer details, brighter colors, and even richer fabrics. We'll update you along the way if you back this project so you know exactly what to anticipate! 
What size should I get? 
Check out our size guide here!
I want a personalized jacket. Where can I add the personalization?
We'll send out a survey at the end of the campaign period to ask for this and other details!",29.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>About Voice Assistants</strong></p>
<p>Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri, and Google’s Voice are revolutionary systems that include thousands of built-in features. Amazon Alexa is also an OS that boasts an ever-growing list of third-party applications, designed to allow you to control your technology with your voice. All three of these systems are getting better by the day, and they can control an increasing number of devices.</p>
<p><strong>About Jinni</strong><br/>Jinni is a lot like a Sci-Fi Communicator that integrates Okay Google, Alexa, and Jinni (Android) – or Siri (iOS). Jinni allows you to experience all the great things about your favorite virtual assistants without having to pick favorites. It is the best of both worlds. And, with Jinni, you get a brand new virtual assistant to read your notifications or tell you time out loud without having to pick up your phone. Get a text? Jinni will read it out loud for you so you can instantly respond with a voice command or you can just touch-and-talk too.</p>
<p>The Jinni is a small Bluetooth button that integrates the power of Alexa, and Okay Google into one portable device for Android or Siri for IOS. Jinni is both wearable and magnetic. She can seamlessly go from your lapel to your refrigerator door, to your shower wall, to your steering wheel, to your purse. Jinni connects to your phone via Bluetooth and uses your phone’s data to connect to the Alexa, Siri, and Google Voice servers.</p>
<p>Unlike Echo, Echo Dot, or Tap, Jinni allows you make and receive phone calls and text messages from your existing phone number and is not bound to one room in your home/office.</p>

<p>My name is Chloris of Hollywood, FL. and I along with my husband have wanted to run our own toy company. We finally have a chance with a patent-pending new toy we've created. We've saved up what we could and have funded as much as we could from 3D CADs to the engineering for functionality. Theofin and her family are long time family friends that believed in Key Knows and wanted to be a part of seeing this venture succeed.</p>
<h2>This campaign is very important to us</h2>
<p>The path towards getting our new toy into the market has not been easy and that is why this campaign is very important to us. We initially took our idea to a company for some help in order to get Key Knows in the market but during the meeting they unexpectedly offered to buy us out before we even got our start-up company off the ground. We respectfully declined and decided to continue this venture as we initially intended.</p>
<p><br/>Once we neared manufacturing, we realized we needed more funds for production. We got in contact with an investor that was interested in giving us an interest loan. After he saw more details of our idea, he then wanted to buy equity in the company. The equity he was asking for was too high and he also wanted to rush the product out. We wanted to maintain creative control and also grow with the product we created, so rushing it into the market just to get quick money was not our goal. We're still in contact with the investor but would love to see if we can get Key Knows out and have longevity in the toy market.</p>
<p>Those were both true re-enactments that we included in our video with a bit of humor.</p>
<h3>We've got this far but we really need help</h3>
<p>What is needed now is the funding for molds and minimum purchase orders for the manufacturing. If we do not make our goal here, the production will be on hold but I along with friends and family will first and foremost, satisfy all the perks to the supporters of Key Knows and continue to save money in order to eventually reach the goal to get Key Knows into the market. It's going to happen and will take longer but the initial push with this campaign will be a much needed help.</p>

<h2>Key Knows</h2>
<p>I've noticed how kids love to profess their affection for each other. Friendship bracelets have been a stable in these relationships for decades now. One of the revealing problems with some friendship bracelets is that they are not always easy to personalize. Key Knows are friendship bracelets that each have various amounts of chambers, that can be personalized with regular office tabs/labels. The labels can be printed on or manually personalized with a pen, pencil, crayon or any writing utensil of the users choosing.</p>
<p><strong>Target age range</strong> : 5 yrs. and up.</p>
<p><strong>Key Knows is a modern day twist of the age old friendship bracelet. They are easy to personalize and fun to share with friends</strong>.</p>

<p>The Interchangeable key will be how you will access/open the chambers on the bracelet unit. The key will have labeled corresponding notches to their particular chambers. You can choose to open a single chamber or all of the chambers based on the notches you choose right before you interact it with the bracelet unit. It's kind of like a locket. The chambers will be spring action, which will be triggered open by the key.</p>

<h2><strong>      <strong><br/></strong></strong></h2>
<h2><strong>                             Introducing <span>Mu'Ron™</span> </strong></h2>
<p><strong>Mu'Ron was created by Amadeusz Topka &amp; Faisal Afzal in 2010 by a mutual interest in luxury, fashion, and fine fragrances. Our goal is to use the highest quality oils to create a long lasting scent to enhance one's lifestyle. As Mu'Ron, our mission is to use environmental friendly resources and cutting edge technology to deliver the highest quality product. Our current focus was to design a basic air-freshener which will deliver a designer fragrance. </strong></p>
<p><strong>As you may already know, air-freshener's today lack masculine and feminine aromas and are far from resembling the average cologne or perfume. Modern air-fresheners come in a variety of scents such as pine, cherry, vanilla, lemon, etc. however none of them posses the unique fragrance that is present in contemporary perfumes &amp; colognes.</strong></p>
<h3><img alt=""Mu'Ron's M-3 Air-Freshener featured in a Porsche 911 Carrera S, redefining the way you hang."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/349/156/ec33779e23166f87958eaba0a9b0a4a8_large.jpg?1358827112"" src="""" style="""" title=""Mu'Ron's M-3 Air-Freshener featured in a Porsche 911 Carrera S, redefining the way you hang.""/></h3>
<p><em>*Mu'Ron's M-3 Air-Freshener featured in a Porsche 911 Carrera S, redefining the way you hang.*</em></p>
<h3>About our air-fresheners</h3>
<p><strong>A smell contributes a vital role to our degree of happiness and state of life. From sharpening the memory &amp; influencing our emotions to the Pharaohs of ancient Egypt, scent has been cherished. It has always played an important role not only in our personal life but that of our society and culture. Over the past fourteen months, extensive work has been done in order to perfect the types of notes present in our air-fresheners &amp; their unique way to distribute each scent. A total of ten individual fragrances were composed. Ranging from light to heavy, each one has a unique top, heart and base note arrangement for maximum fragrance disbursement. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Our air-fresheners have been created through inspiration of the hight-end designer perfumes and colognes present in the market today. Plus, we use 100% recycled paper to help out our enviroment ! </strong></p>
<h2><strong>                               Let's get a bit technical.</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>What are fragrance 'notes'?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>These are the ingredients used to make up any type of cologne, perfume or air-freshener and can range from plant and flower extracts to synthetically-created molecules. </strong></p>
<h3><strong>What do the 'Top', 'Heart' and 'Base' categories mean?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Top Notes: </strong><strong>Top notes are evident as soon as the fragrance is exposed. These are usually lighter than the other ingredients, and function by shaping the primary fragrance burst.</strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>Heart or Middle Notes:</strong> Shortly after application, the top notes give way to the heart notes. These are usually floral, as most fruity notes are too light for this layer. These middle notes make up the core cologne, perfume or air-freshener as it is exposed to air, and it is these layers that define the ultimate dry down.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Base notes: The base notes determine how long a fragrance will last, and provide a background on which the heart notes can be appreciated. Interestingly, most fragrances have similar base notes, often including sandalwood, amber, musk and vanilla.

There is no doubt that we will set the standard and revolutionize the current air-freshener market, which will develop new trends in fashion and style.

<p><strong>For the past two years we (Faisal &amp; Amadeusz) have put our heart &amp; soul to make this project live, unfortunately as last year college students we are very limited on funds.

<p><strong>If successfully funded, your generous funds will go towards the following; fragrance oil manufacturing, and the production of the air-fresheners. </strong></p>
<p><strong>However, if our project will not reach its funding goal we will still provide the same quality air-fresheners but without the elegant package (as it requires a minimum order quantity).</strong></p>

<h3>
<strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong> </h3>
<p><strong>We have faced many challenges in development and testing of our Air-Fresheners. Thus far, we have achieved what we wanted and surpassed our expectations. However it wasn't as easy as it may look, over the course of two years extensive amount of work was put in towards product development, research, and longevity of our air-fresheners. In collaboration with our manufacturer (which is located in the United States) we managed to significantly cut down the costs of production while maintaining product integrity. From fragrance to design &amp; everything in between, our dedication (including nights &amp; weekends) made the air-fresheners to what they currently are.</strong></p>
<p><strong>As for the few risks; some may be encountered after our project is successfully funded &amp; mainly pertain to shipping and manufacturing. However, since there will be no control over these circumstances (from our end) we will try to overcome them as best we can.</strong></p>

                             Introducing Mu'Ron™ 
Mu'Ron was created by Amadeusz Topka & Faisal Afzal in 2010 by a mutual interest in luxury, fashion, and fine fragrances. Our goal is to use the highest quality oils to create a long lasting scent to enhance one's lifestyle. As Mu'Ron, our mission is to use environmental friendly resources and cutting edge technology to deliver the highest quality product. Our current focus was to design a basic air-freshener which will deliver a designer fragrance. 
As you may already know, air-freshener's today lack masculine and feminine aromas and are far from resembling the average cologne or perfume. Modern air-fresheners come in a variety of scents such as pine, cherry, vanilla, lemon, etc. however none of them posses the unique fragrance that is present in contemporary perfumes & colognes.

*Mu'Ron's M-3 Air-Freshener featured in a Porsche 911 Carrera S, redefining the way you hang.*
About our air-fresheners
A smell contributes a vital role to our degree of happiness and state of life. From sharpening the memory & influencing our emotions to the Pharaohs of ancient Egypt, scent has been cherished. It has always played an important role not only in our personal life but that of our society and culture. Over the past fourteen months, extensive work has been done in order to perfect the types of notes present in our air-fresheners & their unique way to distribute each scent. A total of ten individual fragrances were composed. Ranging from light to heavy, each one has a unique top, heart and base note arrangement for maximum fragrance disbursement. 
Our air-fresheners have been created through inspiration of the hight-end designer perfumes and colognes present in the market today. Plus, we use 100% recycled paper to help out our enviroment ! 
                               Let's get a bit technical.
What are fragrance 'notes'?
These are the ingredients used to make up any type of cologne, perfume or air-freshener and can range from plant and flower extracts to synthetically-created molecules. 
What do the 'Top', 'Heart' and 'Base' categories mean?
Top Notes: Top notes are evident as soon as the fragrance is exposed. These are usually lighter than the other ingredients, and function by shaping the primary fragrance burst.
Heart or Middle Notes: Shortly after application, the top notes give way to the heart notes. These are usually floral, as most fruity notes are too light for this layer. These middle notes make up the core cologne, perfume or air-freshener as it is exposed to air, and it is these layers that define the ultimate dry down.
Base notes: The base notes determine how long a fragrance will last, and provide a background on which the heart notes can be appreciated. Interestingly, most fragrances have similar base notes, often including sandalwood, amber, musk and vanilla. This is because there are only a certain number of notes that will last long enough to form the base of a fragrance.
Design
Influenced by renowned brands, from automotive to fashion, our distinct design made by Amadeusz Topka is the first of its kind in the world of air-fresheners. A simple, sleek and sexy contour line featuring a golden hue for the gentleman, and a charming roseus pink for the lady will surely add beauty in any setting.

<p class=""p1"">                                                       INSPIRATION</p>
<p class=""p1"">This idea was created 4 years ago by my sister who is no longer with us. As an avid shopper she saw a need to create a product that would solve a problem that has been neglected for entirely too long! After damaging several pairs of shoes and wasting her hard earned money, she came to me with the idea. We knew the idea was good but for some reason we never acted up on it. Shortly after, she fell sick and never recovered. A couple of years flew by and the idea was still stuck in my head. It wasn't until I heard two people complain about how they hated driving while wearing their good shoes. The light came on and I knew that it was time! Now, I'm finally excited to introduce this product to the world! </p>
<p class=""p2""> </p>
<p class=""p2"">                                                         SHOESKINZ</p>
<p class=""p1"">SHOESKINZ is a unique idea. It is designed to protect the shoes from scratches and scuff marks that occur while driving or riding in the car. I'm almost definite that if you have ever driven a car you can relate to this problem. I have several pairs of shoes that have been sitting in my closet for well over a year now because I'm afraid of wearing them due to this issue. Thanks to Shoeskinz, you can now throw away the old  tape tricks.</p>
<p class=""p1"">After making the first prototype we learned that this product has many more uses. With a few adjustments we converted the original design into what we call S2. S2 has broader straps and reflective material to provide visibility to the user while wearing at night. Cyclist, skateboarders, and joggers are just a few examples of people that can benefit from using the S2.</p>
<p class=""p1"">If I may assume, if there is one thing in the world that everyone has in common it is to dress nice. We all work hard for a living and love to treat ourselves sometimes. Money doesn't fall off of trees (unless you all know something I dont know) so you have to take care of what you have. With SHOESKINZ you can feel comfortable about wearing the shoes of your desire. </p>

<p class=""p1"">I chose to make the Shoeskinz out of neoprene material because it is very durable,     flexible, and easy to clean.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The bottom is made of soling rubber (the same rubber on the bottom of your sneakers) so that your foot doesn't slip.</p>

<p></p><p>Before we delve
into why I need you help. Step away from your computer and take a peek into
your closet, armoire, dresser and those bins underneath your bed. What do you
see? Clothes that are drab, outdated and don’t fit with your current style?
Look no further for that specific bundle of stores because Scarlette and Indigo
has arrived.</p>
<p>  <b>THE
5 LEAPS</b></p>
<p>Leap Uno: Create a fabulous company and name
it something AMAZEBALLS! 

</p><p>Leap Two: Create a concept, source fabric, get patterns, make samples and
have an awesome photo shoot while remaining as fabulous as usual!  <img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/> (the
fabulous thing make have lacked in some bits! )</p>
<p>Leap 3:  Launch an
Indiegogo Campaign (have you seen your wallet lately?..It’s a dozy) 

</p><p>Leap 4: Raise enough money to officially launch! Make a grilled cheese in
celebration and kiss my dog! MUAH! (and my boyfriend too for putting up with
me!)</p>
<p>Leap Cinco: Were in the final stretch! Send everything out to my American based
production company add a little sprinkle of fairy dust and then when all is
complete the best part of all.. The launch party/trunk show! </p>
<p>For those of you who want to hear a bit more
about the business-y side of things:</p>

business plan in a <b>NUTSHELL</b></p><p>                        <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/374256/files/20140216165932-nutshel.jpg?1392598772"" src="""" style=""width: 210.95454545454544px; height: 136px;""/></p><p></p><p>Scarlette and Indigo is a young innovative
clothing company for the 21<sup>st</sup> century and beyond. As a young adult I
understand the need for fresh, new fashion forward garments to add to my wardrobe
that same notion simulates that of millions of young adults facing the same
dilemma where to find fashion forward pieces for my age and my creative style
almost seems like a whirlwind of a task for some but for Scarlette and Indigo
it’s what we design for. Our company is divided into the Scarlettes and the
Indigo’s. The Scarlette’s have a very edgy, sassy and sexy style. Whereas the
Indigo’s have a more hipster style. By combining two major style market in one
store. We plan to optimize profits and take the fashion world by storm.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>About Me!!</b>: my name is Alia
White and I am a 19 year old fashion designer and potential fashion school
student. Growing up in Northeast Atlanta I didn’t always have the dreams I have
today because the small town that I live in comes nowhere near the major
fashion cities of New York or Milan. I fell In love with fashion design really
on accident. My mom taught me how to sew pillows at a young age and it really
spiraled from there. I opened Scarlette and Indigo in September 2012 as a
senior in high school and it’s truly been the greatest experience of my life
thus far and I can’t wait to see where we will go next!</p>
<p><b>The
price breakdown</b>:</p>
<p>-Patterns:
I have an amazing pattern maker but for her to be as amazing as she is I have
to pay </p>
<p>-
Samples: My pattern maker is also my sample maker and she’s still as amazing as
previously stated because she is doing both my patterns and my samples</p>
<p>-
Production: My American based production company (specifically in New York
&lt;3) will also need to get paid to make this amazing line come to life.  So support American manufacturers!</p>
<p>-Distribution:
Most of the money that I generate will go to the shipment of all the garments
but we are hoping for a large amount of orders so I will need help financially
to get all of the clothes to your doors!</p><p><br/></p><p>                                  <b>A sneaky Peek of the rewards</b> </p><p>Thank You

into why I need you help. Step away from your computer and take a peek into
your closet, armoire, dresser and those bins underneath your bed. What do you
see? Clothes that are drab, outdated and don’t fit with your current style?
Look no further for that specific bundle of stores because Scarlette and Indigo
has arrived.
  THE
5 LEAPS
Leap Uno: Create a fabulous company and name
it something AMAZEBALLS! 

Leap Two: Create a concept, source fabric, get patterns, make samples and
have an awesome photo shoot while remaining as fabulous as usual!   (the
fabulous thing make have lacked in some bits! )
Leap 3:  Launch an
Indiegogo Campaign (have you seen your wallet lately?..It’s a dozy) 

Leap 4: Raise enough money to officially launch! Make a grilled cheese in
celebration and kiss my dog! MUAH! (and my boyfriend too for putting up with
me!)
Leap Cinco: Were in the final stretch! Send everything out to my American based
production company add a little sprinkle of fairy dust and then when all is
complete the best part of all.. The launch party/trunk show! 
For those of you who want to hear a bit more
about the business-y side of things:
                        My
business plan in a NUTSHELL                        Scarlette and Indigo is a young innovative
clothing company for the 21st century and beyond. As a young adult I
understand the need for fresh, new fashion forward garments to add to my wardrobe
that same notion simulates that of millions of young adults facing the same
dilemma where to find fashion forward pieces for my age and my creative style
almost seems like a whirlwind of a task for some but for Scarlette and Indigo
it’s what we design for. Our company is divided into the Scarlettes and the
Indigo’s. The Scarlette’s have a very edgy, sassy and sexy style. Whereas the
Indigo’s have a more hipster style. By combining two major style market in one
store. We plan to optimize profits and take the fashion world by storm.
About Me!!: my name is Alia
White and I am a 19 year old fashion designer and potential fashion school
student. Growing up in Northeast Atlanta I didn’t always have the dreams I have
today because the small town that I live in comes nowhere near the major
fashion cities of New York or Milan. I fell In love with fashion design really
on accident. My mom taught me how to sew pillows at a young age and it really
spiraled from there. I opened Scarlette and Indigo in September 2012 as a
senior in high school and it’s truly been the greatest experience of my life
thus far and I can’t wait to see where we will go next!
The
price breakdown:
-Patterns:
I have an amazing pattern maker but for her to be as amazing as she is I have
to pay 
-
Samples: My pattern maker is also my sample maker and she’s still as amazing as
previously stated because she is doing both my patterns and my samples
-
Production: My American based production company (specifically in New York
<3) will also need to get paid to make this amazing line come to life.  So support American manufacturers!
-Distribution:
Most of the money that I generate will go to the shipment of all the garments
but we are hoping for a large amount of orders so I will need help financially
to get all of the clothes to your doors!                                  A sneaky Peek of the rewards Thank You
card forget e-thank you’s and thank you emails. I will personally HAND WRITE
(bring on the hand cramps! No expense will be spared) every single card using
the fabulous thank you cards.                 Custom
Bow Tie: I absolutely love making bow ties they were one of the first things I started
sewing for menswear. If you would like a bow tie I am willing to do it in any
color scheme, pattern and size!A signed photo from the first or second photo shoot! Let me explain:
I had a preliminary photo shoot for a few pieces in the collection and then I
will be doing another photo shoot when all the pieces are complete you may
choose from a selected few images from both photo shoots and you can let me
know what you would like!A DVD of behind the scenes footage of both photo shoots for ‘Harlette’
along with behind the scenes interviews and commentary.
A look book with images of every garment in the line from the photo
shoot! With images from the line above!A  pair of leggings from the line in your size!A signed sketch! My original hand drawn sketches that I will sign that
you can keep forever!!          A hand sewn garment personalized to your
measurements from the line! I will offer a top and a bottom of your choosing!            So what is this Indiegogo thing anyway?

<b>If I ask you how much time (hours did you spend in learning the practical work-related technical skills that you know today. What will your estimate be?<br/></b><p></p>
<p>Let’s say you came up with a number which reflects the time you invested to learn, say programming or using some business software application such as Microsoft Excel<b>. </b>And WHAT IF I told you there was a way to learn the same skill set in <u>75-80% lesser time</u>? Does it Sounds too good, and too late? My response would be Yes and No, respectively and I’ll share why I say so.</p>
<p>I quit my last job in early 2009 (J.P. Morgan, Mumbai) to start my first business venture in Training. The origin of the idea was based on my experience at KPMG (Assurance) and J.P. Morgan (Investment Banking). I had observed that every individual had learnt and was still learning applications of Excel through trial-and-error and by working on the job. People felt proud on boasting about the “x” number of years in learning those skills. However, I realized that if they would have received early “Excel Coaching” guidance, they could have drastically shortened their learning time from years to days. Additionally, the training has to be based on practical problems related to day-to-day work such as Tax Filing, MIS Reporting, Annual Report charts, cleaning ERP data dumps in Excel, automatic data pull up and so on.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1286902/files/20150311103427-RP_Class.png?1426095267"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>So I spent the next 5 years in training professionals on “Advanced Excel” applications across different companies and cities. With experience of training 6,500+ professionals in 2-day workshops and 3,000+ professionals in various Seminars and Conferences, I refined my “Advanced Excel” program to “Advanced Excel Ninja” program. I was eager to spread this refined flavor of Excel program to a wider audience. And during this time, in mid-2014, I met my current business partner, Rishabh Bhandari (Mumbai), who is an MBA and has worked extensively with education-focused PE Investment fund. His insights on how can we make an excel course  more engaging, interesting and user-friendly helped us develop the methodology of converting my experience into training Videos. We went through 100s of pre-recorded videos of different Trainers and we identified the gaps that prevent a learner from learning online. “<a href=""http://www.yodalearning.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Yoda Learning Solutions</a>” was born as an idea to fill the gap that prevents a learner from learning online. Yoda Learning, in short time created 29 courses and a network of 15,000 learners across the globe.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1304619/files/20150318020124-Untitled-1.jpg?1426669284"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""/><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Once Yoda Learning took off,  I told myself, why stop at making someone really “Ninja” level of Microsoft Excel. Why
can’t they be guided and trained to be a Professional Trainer themselves? This could open a
plethora of business opportunities (Training / Consulting) for enthusiastic
professionals. Not only that, for professionals already employed and working
full time with different companies, this gives them an opportunity to train
their team members and propel themselves into next senior position owing to the
value addition to the team .</p>

<p><b>What’s Unleash an Excel trainer:
From Zero to Ninja?</b></p>
<p>So finally, we come to this campaign – Unleash a trainer: From Zero to Excel Ninja. This project is brainchild of my interaction with so many HR professionals who work in training and development teams. </p>

I want to propel you from the current proficiency level to a level where you can train professional users and explore a very satisfying and rewarding career opportunity.First, I teach you how the important functions and techniques are used practically by taking examples from different domains of a business. And, as you progress in the program, I will also the tricks which make teaching complex topics super easy.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>If you are an Experienced Excel user: </b>I am fascinated by the legends of Ninja. And to me, in today’s context, it stands for the group of elite performers who have developed “super-human” ability to attack a problem using diverse tactics and skills. It requires excellence and more importantly, precise guidance. I will coach you to reach the Ninja level of Excel. Why stop at plain and simple one dimensional VLOOKUP formula if you can know how to use three-dimensional lookup and reverse lookup? Why waste months and years in learning that through trial-and-error, if you can learn all that in a structured and well-defined 11 -15 hours.</p>
<p></p>
<p>                  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1358176/files/20150405222021-2015-04-03_04-50-46__L123.jpg?1428297621"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<p><b>If you are an Expert Excel user: </b>Wouldn’t you agree with me that being an Expert Excel user requires different skill set than becoming an Expert Excel Trainer? The trainer has to make the topics easy-to-understand for the learners and teach them the real-world applications so as to keep them engaged and interested. I use <b>mnemonics</b> to help learners remember complex formula strategies and it has been tested with over 9,500+ learners in LIVE interaction. My <b>eBook (PDF)</b> has mostly picture based illustrations to help learners quickly refer to the tricks they learnt. I <b>use my learners’ queries to build videos</b> to help them connect their problems with the learning instantly. So with your existing knowledge and with an additional assistance of my learning program (ready-made Excel Case Studies, PDF eBook), you can create an alternative (or even mainstream) career in the field of <b>Professional Coaching and Consulting</b>. </p>

<p><b>What do we need and What you get?</b></p>
<p>At Yoda learning we have been
striving to achieve the next level in digital learning experience. Being a
startup we are high on ideas and passion to execute those ideas. For our next big
leap we need to develop a module that extensively covers the Microsoft Excel in
the form of video tutorials, working files for practice, eBooks and live
virtual learning on training skills.</p>
I’m ready to put my
time and resources if I’m able to fund production for the project. The major
costs involved in this project is course editing, eBook development and
Assessment test battery with mapped videos and pdf report so the course
experience is personalized for you. So in all, We need $2000 to fund our overheads (and we invest time and energy to make a superb course)<br/><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>

2. You can check the course outline and leave comments if you want to add/subtract few elements. You can reach me at rishabh@yodalearning.com



Join us in this campaign and We will offer you lifetime access to the course that empowers you and helps you lead your career
If I ask you how much time (hours did you spend in learning the practical work-related technical skills that you know today. What will your estimate be?
Let’s say you came up with a number which reflects the time you invested to learn, say programming or using some business software application such as Microsoft Excel. And WHAT IF I told you there was a way to learn the same skill set in 75-80% lesser time? Does it Sounds too good, and too late? My response would be Yes and No, respectively and I’ll share why I say so.
I quit my last job in early 2009 (J.P. Morgan, Mumbai) to start my first business venture in Training. The origin of the idea was based on my experience at KPMG (Assurance) and J.P. Morgan (Investment Banking). I had observed that every individual had learnt and was still learning applications of Excel through trial-and-error and by working on the job. People felt proud on boasting about the “x” number of years in learning those skills. However, I realized that if they would have received early “Excel Coaching” guidance, they could have drastically shortened their learning time from years to days. Additionally, the training has to be based on practical problems related to day-to-day work such as Tax Filing, MIS Reporting, Annual Report charts, cleaning ERP data dumps in Excel, automatic data pull up and so on.


So I spent the next 5 years in training professionals on “Advanced Excel” applications across different companies and cities. With experience of training 6,500+ professionals in 2-day workshops and 3,000+ professionals in various Seminars and Conferences, I refined my “Advanced Excel” program to “Advanced Excel Ninja” program. I was eager to spread this refined flavor of Excel program to a wider audience. And during this time, in mid-2014, I met my current business partner, Rishabh Bhandari (Mumbai), who is an MBA and has worked extensively with education-focused PE Investment fund. His insights on how can we make an excel course  more engaging, interesting and user-friendly helped us develop the methodology of converting my experience into training Videos. We went through 100s of pre-recorded videos of different Trainers and we identified the gaps that prevent a learner from learning online. “Yoda Learning Solutions” was born as an idea to fill the gap that prevents a learner from learning online. Yoda Learning, in short time created 29 courses and a network of 15,000 learners across the globe.


Once Yoda Learning took off,  I told myself, why stop at making someone really “Ninja” level of Microsoft Excel. Why
can’t they be guided and trained to be a Professional Trainer themselves? This could open a
plethora of business opportunities (Training / Consulting) for enthusiastic
professionals. Not only that, for professionals already employed and working
full time with different companies, this gives them an opportunity to train
their team members and propel themselves into next senior position owing to the
value addition to the team .

What’s Unleash an Excel trainer:
From Zero to Ninja?
So finally, we come to this campaign – Unleash a trainer: From Zero to Excel Ninja. This project is brainchild of my interaction with so many HR professionals who work in training and development teams. 


 Click here for course outlineIf you are a Beginner in Excel: I will SAVE you YEARS! I want to propel you from the current proficiency level to a level where you can train professional users and explore a very satisfying and rewarding career opportunity.First, I teach you how the important functions and techniques are used practically by taking examples from different domains of a business. And, as you progress in the program, I will also the tricks which make teaching complex topics super easy.

If you are an Experienced Excel user: I am fascinated by the legends of Ninja. And to me, in today’s context, it stands for the group of elite performers who have developed “super-human” ability to attack a problem using diverse tactics and skills. It requires excellence and more importantly, precise guidance. I will coach you to reach the Ninja level of Excel. Why stop at plain and simple one dimensional VLOOKUP formula if you can know how to use three-dimensional lookup and reverse lookup? Why waste months and years in learning that through trial-and-error, if you can learn all that in a structured and well-defined 11 -15 hours.

                  



If you are an Expert Excel user: Wouldn’t you agree with me that being an Expert Excel user requires different skill set than becoming an Expert Excel Trainer? The trainer has to make the topics easy-to-understand for the learners and teach them the real-world applications so as to keep them engaged and interested. I use mnemonics to help learners remember complex formula strategies and it has been tested with over 9,500+ learners in LIVE interaction. My eBook (PDF) has mostly picture based illustrations to help learners quickly refer to the tricks they learnt. I use my learners’ queries to build videos to help them connect their problems with the learning instantly. So with your existing knowledge and with an additional assistance of my learning program (ready-made Excel Case Studies, PDF eBook), you can create an alternative (or even mainstream) career in the field of Professional Coaching and Consulting.

How did we make THE BEST LEARNING
EXPERIENCE for you?




The Trainer is with you. The Trainer (not
talking robot) appears in every video and makes sure he “walks” you through the
learning session.


Script reading is BORING. We follow the
narration approach similar to that of a LIVE Workshop.








Continuous Learning: With lifetime access to
the online videos and frequently added videos on solving viewer questions, the
library is ever increasing.


Captions/Subtitles: To add another layer of
learning aid, we have also embedded Subtitles to the video. Power to you.

Downloadable Excel Case Studies (XLSX) for
practice

Trainer with experience of training over
6,000 professionals LIVE. This enables him to anticipate viewer questions in
addition to common pitfalls and pain points while working with Excel
techniques. The same has been incorporated in the video sessions with personalized learning path




Why am I running this campaign?

This
campaign is really important to us since we are attempting to create
trainer-level excel users who can be Heroes at their organizations.
Theoretically, I are cannibalizing our own classroom training business (since
classroom program cost 10x of what online program costs) but I think that if I
can raise some capital to fund overhead expenses, the benefit of such project
is immense. The project will not only include course tutorials but live
training on how to turn into a trainer – more on public speaking and training
effectiveness.
You
contributions will help me to create this project and deliver within 30 days of
project closing. Each backer (The one who supports us in this campaign) will be rewarded with early bird access to the
course at a rock bottom cost (cost of backing this campaign)

</div></div>","With the endless number of electronic devices that we rely on daily, using a conventional power strip has become the standard method for powering multiple devices simultaneously. While simply effective, the power strip does nothing to organize the numerous charging cables that are attached to it, often leaving a tangled mess of wires. BoxTap: The Next Generation Power Strip solves this frustrating issue all in one simple and intuitive design.       Shaped as a simple box console, BoxTap has five electronic sockets and two USB slots to plug in electronic devices while also incorporating a space to store any excess cable. On the front of BoxTap is a button console which organizes all of the power buttons. There is also a main power button to turn all devices ON/OFF.   Each of the power buttons is labelled with icon stickers so you can easily see which power button corresponds to what device. There is no need to fumble around for each individual power switch. Blank stickers are provided to label unique devices.   The back of BoxTap contains one socket that is placed lower to fit any adaptor and four sockets lined up to snugly fit any other plug. The perforated back cover keeps the cables contained while allowing air to circulate, thereby preventing overheating.     
ORGANIZE YOUR STUDY ORGANIZE YOUR LIVING ROOM ORGANIZE YOUR KITCHEN 
    By organizing all excess cable in the built-in cable management container, BoxTap not only keeps your living and working spaces incredibly tidy it also prevents safety hazards. There are no jumble of cords to trip over. Additionally, power strips are often left on the floor where small children and pets are vulnerable to mistake it as a toy.  With conventional power strips, cleaning can be a hassle trying to navigate between all those cords. With BoxTap, this daily task is simplified as your living spaces are neat and organized.   
 


Leaving a device plugged in can lead to energy waste that can add up to costly energy bills. With BoxTap save energy my simply turning off the main button. 
 



BoxTap was designed to simplify your life. With its simple and clean design, BoxTap complements any space whether it be the study or the kitchen. BoxTap can be used as a computer stand and fits in most shelves and book stands.",40.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div><p><strong>FIRST OF ALL - THANK YOU!!!!</strong></p><div>
</div><p><strong>GIJ was launched in 2014 with a GREAT Indiegogo campaign - THANK YOU to everyone who supported me - I am glad you are all LOVING and using your bags!  I raised enough to support my first round of production, but not enough to finish my website.  SO... I am doing a small campaign to fund the website + the GIJ vegan bag 'perks' can all be in your hands by the holidays - they make GREAT gifts!  AND be the first to get the latest GIJ bag - the fabulous ""Paige Bag"".  </strong><strong><br/></strong></p><div>
</div><p><strong>THE STORY OF GIJ</strong></p><div>
</div><p>GIJ is committed to offering great vegan bags that are both current and timeless.  Designed and headquartered in Manhattan Beach, California, GIJ bags are meant to be well-used, well-traveled and well-loved and get better with age.</p><div>
</div><p>At the heart of GIJ vegan is <strong>RESPECT</strong> - </p><div>
</div><ul>
<li>For <strong>ANIMALS</strong> - All bags are 100% vegan and cruelty free.  No animal products, skins or insect-based dyes are used.</li>
<li>For <strong>PEOPLE</strong> - We only source factories and resources that practice fair trade and are actively committed to improving labor conditions in the garment industry.</li>
<li>For the <strong>ENVIRONMENT</strong> - We use the most sustainable &amp; eco-friendly fibers we can find for each bag, use EU approved dyes and finishes, and our makers carefully control and monitor waste water.  Our bags are all mindfully designed and sourced. </li>
<li>For our local <strong>COMMUNITY</strong> - The founder of GIJ has been rescuing dogs from the streets of Los Angeles for the past 6 years.  GIJ LLC is committed to <strong>GIVING BACK</strong> a portion of their proceeds to continue in this effort to rescue, tend to medical needs, train, foster and find forever homes for animals in need.  GIJ is currently supporting a senior dog named Alli and is committed to all of her needs and finding her a FOREVER home.</li>
</ul><div>
</div><p><strong>GIJ FOUNDER AND DESIGNER - KATHY ARTHUN</strong></p><div>
</div><p>""With 28 years in the fashion industry as a Designer and Design Director, I realized there was a handbag niche that I could fill with a California casual aesthetic that would appeal to vegans and non-vegans alike.  I decided to name the company GIJ (pronounced 'gidge') after my beloved dog, Gidget, who was the start of my love and respect of all animals.</p><div>
</div><p>I have worked for very small companies, mid-size companies, very large companies like Target Corp. and started a clothing company shortly out of college.  My diverse background and entrepreneurial spirit has given me a well-rounded knowledge of design, development, sourcing, manufacturing, production, sales and marketing.  I am very excited to bring this all together with GIJ LLC - a business I have worked very hard to develop up to this point and one that I am very proud of.  <strong>CONTRIBUTING TO THIS CAMPAIGN</strong> <strong>WILL HELP ME COMPLETE THE LAST PIECE OF THE PUZZLE - TO LAUNCH A COMPLETE, FUNCTIONAL WEBSITE!""</strong></p><div>
</div><p><strong>WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET</strong></p><div>
</div><p>100% of the money raised in this campaign will go to fund the completion of our <a href=""http://www.gijvegan.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.gijvegan.com</a> website, which at this point is just a placeholder site.</p><div>
</div><p>In exchange for contributions, you can get one of the very first GIJ PAIGE bags! We are also offering both the Kingsley hemp bags and the California Streets pouches as great ""perks"".  In our retail business, we are targeting accounts like Neiman Marcus Cusp, Barneys, Anthropologie, Urban Outfitters and every hip, trendy boutique in the country.  </p><div>

</div></div>","FIRST OF ALL - THANK YOU!!!!
GIJ was launched in 2014 with a GREAT Indiegogo campaign - THANK YOU to everyone who supported me - I am glad you are all LOVING and using your bags!  I raised enough to support my first round of production, but not enough to finish my website.  SO... I am doing a small campaign to fund the website + the GIJ vegan bag 'perks' can all be in your hands by the holidays - they make GREAT gifts!  AND be the first to get the latest GIJ bag - the fabulous ""Paige Bag"".  
THE STORY OF GIJ
GIJ is committed to offering great vegan bags that are both current and timeless.  Designed and headquartered in Manhattan Beach, California, GIJ bags are meant to be well-used, well-traveled and well-loved and get better with age.
At the heart of GIJ vegan is RESPECT - 

For ANIMALS - All bags are 100% vegan and cruelty free.  No animal products, skins or insect-based dyes are used.
For PEOPLE - We only source factories and resources that practice fair trade and are actively committed to improving labor conditions in the garment industry.
For the ENVIRONMENT - We use the most sustainable & eco-friendly fibers we can find for each bag, use EU approved dyes and finishes, and our makers carefully control and monitor waste water.  Our bags are all mindfully designed and sourced. 
For our local COMMUNITY - The founder of GIJ has been rescuing dogs from the streets of Los Angeles for the past 6 years.  GIJ LLC is committed to GIVING BACK a portion of their proceeds to continue in this effort to rescue, tend to medical needs, train, foster and find forever homes for animals in need.  GIJ is currently supporting a senior dog named Alli and is committed to all of her needs and finding her a FOREVER home.

GIJ FOUNDER AND DESIGNER - KATHY ARTHUN
""With 28 years in the fashion industry as a Designer and Design Director, I realized there was a handbag niche that I could fill with a California casual aesthetic that would appeal to vegans and non-vegans alike.  I decided to name the company GIJ (pronounced 'gidge') after my beloved dog, Gidget, who was the start of my love and respect of all animals.
I have worked for very small companies, mid-size companies, very large companies like Target Corp. and started a clothing company shortly out of college.  My diverse background and entrepreneurial spirit has given me a well-rounded knowledge of design, development, sourcing, manufacturing, production, sales and marketing.  I am very excited to bring this all together with GIJ LLC - a business I have worked very hard to develop up to this point and one that I am very proud of.  CONTRIBUTING TO THIS CAMPAIGN WILL HELP ME COMPLETE THE LAST PIECE OF THE PUZZLE - TO LAUNCH A COMPLETE, FUNCTIONAL WEBSITE!""
WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET
100% of the money raised in this campaign will go to fund the completion of our www.gijvegan.com website, which at this point is just a placeholder site.
In exchange for contributions, you can get one of the very first GIJ PAIGE bags! We are also offering both the Kingsley hemp bags and the California Streets pouches as great ""perks"".  In our retail business, we are targeting accounts like Neiman Marcus Cusp, Barneys, Anthropologie, Urban Outfitters and every hip, trendy boutique in the country.

I want to track my physical output always, but I don’t want to wear a rubber band all the time. And remember to put it on – assuming I didn’t also forget to charge it the night before.”</p><p>Chance does indeed favour the prepared mind, and such silly wisecracks would become a devastating epigram of the purest wisdom. It was almost like something banging on the exit out of Charlie’s subconscious, an idea trying desperately to escape from imagination into reality. From there, springing out of the daffodils on our sister’s kitchen counter, <em>Bling</em> was born.</p><p>With a background in analogue devices and digital signal processors, Charlie is a seasoned alumnus in the mature personal headphone market, having spent close to a decade in Asia and with established ties to network of mainland factories, including Foxconn. A graduate of Silicon Valley, Charlie has previously lead engineering and design teams in developing white label retail products on behalf of Philips, Huawei, and Asus. Charlie is currently leading the <em>Bling</em> technology effort locally in Hong Kong and China.</p><p>Leading the charge on the business front, John brings a diverse breadth of management experiences to the table, having practiced in the technology, utilities, education and retail fields, for both private and public sector organizations. A finance geek at heart, John comes from over 15 years in deploying major ERP systems and has lead the development of over $300M+ in custom software and various other business and accounting applications for clients including Accenture, PeopleSoft and SAP.  John is now incubating Posh.Tech in Vancouver, BC, and has previously helped launch two startups out of Mountain View, CA – ePhysicians and Verplex Systems.</p><p>From our auspicious start, we have argued amongst ourselves, screamed and yelled at our suppliers, pulled out some hairs and even threatened genetic testing to prove the lineage of our founders. Thankfully, we are now a team of 6, spread across two hemispheres, and no blood has yet been spilt. Our team is 100% committed to the success of project, and delivering <em>Bling</em> to you in the shortest time possible.</p><p>Our product – and our company – is about giving you the machines to enhance your life, and every aspect of it. And do that with uncompromising style; because to survive is necessary; but to strive is elegant. This is who we are.</p><p></p><h1>Latest Status</h1><p>As at launch of our funding campaign, we will be nearing completion of our DVT phase with trials against our beta prototype that you see here. The ideas continue to flow from our engineers and industrial designers, and the enthusiasm is admittedly difficult to shut down!  Alas, the iron ring adage holds true: it costs a penny to make a change in design, a dime in production, and a dollar in the field. Our hope is to leave a small window of opportunity for consideration of comments from our backers, before we freeze our Mk. I design at the conclusion of DVT over the next 30 days. </p><p>TO ALL OF OUR BACKERS AND SUPPORTERS, THANK YOU FOR MAKING THIS IDEA POSSIBLE!</p></div>","IdeaImagine a biometric counter that is crafted from precious and semi precious metals, while measuring your physical activity 24/7.  A piece of jewellery that you would actually wear, versus just another rubber band around your wrist.  It does not require constant charging; will not interfere with common activities such as typing; has enough memory to store daily activities for up to a month; and will automatically learn and adjust the events it monitors, self-personalizing itself based on your use over time.Bling.  It is the most exclusive biometric counter in the world.Key Features

We then use an onboard microprocessor to continuously interpret and calculate step, distance, speed, and caloric parameters, based on strides as recorded by this logic.Bling's integrated circuit logic, then, is based on a decision flow which we have reproduced as follows; sans the trade secrets that we have developed internally, of course:Bored already?  Okay how about some pretty pictures now:PrototypeIt will be possible to create Bling with gold, silver, rose, black, coffee, and pure plated colours.  Consumer studies are currently underway to determine the most optimal combination to bring to market.  Be a part of the decision process!  Send us your comments and preferences and we will respond accordingly.SoftwareCurrently, our developers are working on an iOS companion app for Bling, and adding new features daily.  If we surpass our funding goal by any appreciable measure, we will begin to build an Android compatible version immediately - this is not a stretch goal, because technology transparently is not a stretch goal of our company.  We wantBling to be completely platform agnostic!Some screenshots of our beta code below.  Don't worry, the production version will be in the proper language!Process to MarketPosh.Tech will adopt a product development process based on practiced ISO-9001 standards by its founders to turn Bling from concept to delivery.  We will observe five sequential stages to completion: Planning, Design & EVT (Engineering Validation Test), DVT (Design Validation Test), PVT (Production Validation Test) and MP (Mass Production), each of which requires specific methodology and criteria be applied to research, design, development, quality assurance, manufacturing and support.  Our project manager and company co-founder will lead our OEM suppliers through an established and itemized list of requirements and processes. Our end hope is that our customers - and backers - will benefit with total quality assurance, overall resource savings, and a faster product and solution development cycle; all so we can accelerate our time to market.  Once we reach the MP Phase of our project, your local FedEx, UPS, DHL, or TNT courier will be our partner for final delivery to your front door!Funding and Allocation
We will use all monies raised through this campaign to take use through to PVT and mass production, to be allocated as follows:Tooling: $15,000Certification: $10,000Pilot Run: $10,000Production Run: $15,000Delivery: $5,000The Team“This is crap,” as yet another colleague proclaims with great derision. “My life does not revolve around a gym or studio. I want to track my physical output always, but I don’t want to wear a rubber band all the time. And remember to put it on – assuming I didn’t also forget to charge it the night before.”Chance does indeed favour the prepared mind, and such silly wisecracks would become a devastating epigram of the purest wisdom. It was almost like something banging on the exit out of Charlie’s subconscious, an idea trying desperately to escape from imagination into reality. From there, springing out of the daffodils on our sister’s kitchen counter, Bling was born.With a background in analogue devices and digital signal processors, Charlie is a seasoned alumnus in the mature personal headphone market, having spent close to a decade in Asia and with established ties to network of mainland factories, including Foxconn. A graduate of Silicon Valley, Charlie has previously lead engineering and design teams in developing white label retail products on behalf of Philips, Huawei, and Asus. Charlie is currently leading the Bling technology effort locally in Hong Kong and China.Leading the charge on the business front, John brings a diverse breadth of management experiences to the table, having practiced in the technology, utilities, education and retail fields, for both private and public sector organizations. A finance geek at heart, John comes from over 15 years in deploying major ERP systems and has lead the development of over $300M+ in custom software and various other business and accounting applications for clients including Accenture, PeopleSoft and SAP.  John is now incubating Posh.Tech in Vancouver, BC, and has previously helped launch two startups out of Mountain View, CA – ePhysicians and Verplex Systems.From our auspicious start, we have argued amongst ourselves, screamed and yelled at our suppliers, pulled out some hairs and even threatened genetic testing to prove the lineage of our founders. Thankfully, we are now a team of 6, spread across two hemispheres, and no blood has yet been spilt. Our team is 100% committed to the success of project, and delivering Bling to you in the shortest time possible.Our product – and our company – is about giving you the machines to enhance your life, and every aspect of it. And do that with uncompromising style; because to survive is necessary; but to strive is elegant. This is who we are.Latest StatusAs at launch of our funding campaign, we will be nearing completion of our DVT phase with trials against our beta prototype that you see here. The ideas continue to flow from our engineers and industrial designers, and the enthusiasm is admittedly difficult to shut down!  Alas, the iron ring adage holds true: it costs a penny to make a change in design, a dime in production, and a dollar in the field. Our hope is to leave a small window of opportunity for consideration of comments from our backers, before we freeze our Mk. I design at the conclusion of DVT over the next 30 days. TO ALL OF OUR BACKERS AND SUPPORTERS, THANK YOU FOR MAKING THIS IDEA POSSIBLE!",23.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><br/></p><p>More than a
simple scarf, the Krama is a cultural heritage that has been passed on from
generation to generation for centuries in Cambodia. It is a cotton and
checkered scarf that has many uses in every day’s life in Cambodia:shading from
the sun, carrying infants over the shoulder or being used as a rope to collect
firewood. It has most of all a strong symbolic as the scarf of belonging of the
Khmer people. It bears the values of a whole people, made of dignity, courage,
optimism and thirst for life.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/682865/files/20140629151322-Untitled-4.jpg?1404080002"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The Krama appeared to us as the best way to share our passion for
Cambodia and to act for this country. Now that Cambodia is initiating the
reconstruction of its society, it is us who inherit the scarf of belonging of
the Khmers, the state of mind it embodies and who have the privilege to wear it
side by side with them.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p>                                           <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/682867/files/20140629151431-The_project.jpg?1404080071"" src="""" style=""width: 265.7142857142857px; height: 60px;""/></p><br/><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/682870/files/20140629151624-Photo_3.jpg?1404080184"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Adding to the
Krama a Parisian touch (but without altering it for we want the same Krama as
the Cambodian people to be worn outside Cambodia) and turning into a fashion
accessory allows to fund a social project in Cambodia. Thus, every Krama
Heritage is crafted in a responsible and ethical way by a lady weaver in the

started Krama Heritage before graduating from college, we are proud of what we

Krama Heritage to the next level, we want the Krama to be for you as easy to
get as it is to wear, but we lack the financial means to do so. We trust that,
with your help, we can achieve so much more. If we reach our campaign goal,
this is how we will use the crowdfunding resources:</p>
<p>1)<span>  </span><b>Pay for fashion exhibitions</b>. Those are the places where fashion designers meet distributors from
all over the world, and each of them costs several thousand euros. We have
built a brand we trust will appeal to distributors, so the more fashion
exhibitions we attend, the more likely you will find Kramas at your-next-door
shop very soon.</p>
<p>2)<span>  </span><b>Widen the Krama Heritage team</b>. Outside of those fashion exhibitions, we
would like to enlarge our team, hire interns or salespersons to approach the
distributors in the most effective way. </p>
<p>3)<span>  </span><b>Turn our website into the worldwide Krama Heritage store. </b>We want to give our website (<a href=""http://www.krama-heritage.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.krama-heritage.net</a> <span class=""wrc_icon wrc13""></span> <span class=""wrc_icon wrc13""></span>) a full
revamping for you to be able to purchase the Krama of your choice wherever you
are in the world next September.</p>
<p>4)<span>  </span><b>Launch new Krama Heritage collections</b>. You might have wondered why there is only one
model in the ‘Les Estivales’ collection! Apart from the minimum order
quantities we have to deal with, we would like our Kramas catalogue to always
reflect your tastes and launch new Kramas collections, in different sizes and
materials </p><p>5) <b>Deepen our social project in Cambodia</b>, namely ""The Showcase project - Entrepreneurs &amp; Artists from Cambodia"" whereby we would like to give the opportunity to Cambodian people to pitch in their projects through videos we would showcase, to allow exposure and attract investors.

<p>Plus qu’un simple foulard, le Krama est un héritage culturel
qui se transmet de génération en génération et depuis des siècles au Cambodge.
C’est un foulard en coton et à carreaux qui a de nombreux usages dans la vie de
tous les jours : se protéger contre le soleil, porter des enfants contre
l’épaule ou servir de corde pour la collecte du bois. Il a surtout une
symbolique forte comme foulard d’appartenance du peuple Khmer. Il porte les
valeurs de tout un peuple, faites de dignité, courage, optimisme et soif de
vivre.</p>

<p>Le Krama nous est apparu comme le meilleur moyen de partager
notre passion pour le Cambodge et d’agir pour ce pays. Alors que le Cambodge
amorce la reconstruction de sa société, c’est à notre tour d’hériter du foulard

privilège de le porter à leur côté.</p>

<p>Ajouter au Krama une touche parisienne (mais sans l’altérer

<p>Nous avons lancé Krama Héritage avant d’être diplômés, et
nous sommes fiers de ce que nous avons réussi à accomplir avec très peu de
ressources. Nous avons hâte de pouvoir passer à la vitesse supérieure, nous
voulons que le Krama soit pour vous aussi facile à obtenir qu’à porter, mais
nous n’avons pas les ressources financières pour le faire. Nous sommes
convaincus qu’avec votre aide nous pouvons accomplir tellement plus. Si nous
atteignons notre objectif de campagne, voici comment nous allons utiliser les
ressources du crowdfunding :</p>
<p>1) 
 <b>Participer à des salons de créateurs</b>.
Ce sont les endroits où les créateurs de mode rencontrent les distributeurs du
monde entier, et chacun d’entre eux coûte plusieurs milliers d’euros. Nous
avons construit une marque qui, nous en avons la conviction, plaira aux
distributeurs et plus nous faisons de salons, plus vous aurez des chances de
trouver des Kramas dans la boutique près de chez vous très bientôt !</p>
<p>2) 
<b>Agrandir
l’équipe Krama Heritage</b>. En plus de ces salons, nous souhaitons agrandir
notre équipe, recruter des stagiaires ou des commerciaux pour pouvoir approcher
les distributeurs de la façon la plus efficace possible.</p>
<p>3) 
<b>Faire de
notre site internet la boutique mondiale Krama Heritage</b>. Nous souhaitons apporter
à notre site une vraie refonte afin que vous puissiez acheter le Krama de votre
choix où que vous soyez dans le monde dès septembre prochain.</p>
<p>4) 
<b>Lancer de
nouvelles collections Krama Heritage</b>. Vous vous êtes peut-être demandé
pourquoi il n’y a qu’un seul modèle dans la collection ‘Les Estivales’ !
Hormis les minimums associés aux quantités commandées avec lesquels nous devons
composer, nous voulons que notre catalogue de Kramas reflète toujours vos goûts
et attentes et voulons lancer de nouvelles collections, dans différentes
tailles et matières. </p>
<p>5) <b>Approfondir notre projet social au Cambodge</b>, principalement ""Le Showcase project - Entrepreneurs et Artistes du Cambodge"" où nous voulons donner l'opportunité à des Cambodgiens d'exposer leur projet sous forme de vidéos que nous diffuserons, leur donnant une exposition nouvelle et leur permettant d'attirer des investisseurs. Cela nécessiterait aussi un budget supplémentaire.</p>

“Krama
Heritage is one of those rare brands that don't come around too often. The fact that they are willing to give
back to the place that inspired their company makes me admire them a lot. These
aren't scarves that only Parisian women can wear, these scarves transcend
gender and cultural barriers” - LAURA NEUZETH BLOG
French version below


                                                         Collection ""Renaissance""                                                    Krama
Heritage is a Parisian brand of scarves with one ambition:  turn Cambodia’s traditional scarf into an international
fashion accessory and achieve social impact in Cambodia.
Our two new
collections ‘Renaissance’ and ‘Les Estivales’ are available for the first time
at a special Indiegogo launch price of €35 ($48) and €45 ($61) with free
worldwide postage. Select a perk on the right hand side to pre-order your
Krama.
Please note: We have a limited amount of stock available for July delivery. Please
order promptly if you’d like to be the first to wear your Krama this summer!
                                              
More than a
simple scarf, the Krama is a cultural heritage that has been passed on from
generation to generation for centuries in Cambodia. It is a cotton and
checkered scarf that has many uses in every day’s life in Cambodia:shading from
the sun, carrying infants over the shoulder or being used as a rope to collect
firewood. It has most of all a strong symbolic as the scarf of belonging of the
Khmer people. It bears the values of a whole people, made of dignity, courage,
optimism and thirst for life.
The Krama appeared to us as the best way to share our passion for
Cambodia and to act for this country. Now that Cambodia is initiating the
reconstruction of its society, it is us who inherit the scarf of belonging of
the Khmers, the state of mind it embodies and who have the privilege to wear it
side by side with them.                                           Adding to the
Krama a Parisian touch (but without altering it for we want the same Krama as
the Cambodian people to be worn outside Cambodia) and turning into a fashion
accessory allows to fund a social project in Cambodia. Thus, every Krama
Heritage is crafted in a responsible and ethical way by a lady weaver in the
pure Khmer tradition and supports the local economy in Phnom Penh.
As we also wanted to act for education in Cambodia, every Krama Heritage
also contributes directly to the development of the charity Pour un Sourire d’Enfant (For a Child’s
Smile) – on a par with €3 per Krama Heritage – whose action in schooling
children in Cambodia is as courageous as essential.
 An entrepreneurial and human
project, Krama Heritage is the adventure of a whole community of héritiers, the bearers of the Krama.  From Phnom Penh to Paris, from Paris to New
York and Saint Petersburg, they show their adherence to the project and are
seen participating in photo shoots.
This
is also the occasion for us to showcase the works of talented photographers
from all over the world.
                                   As we have
started Krama Heritage before graduating from college, we are proud of what we
have managed to accomplish with very little resources. We can’t wait to take
Krama Heritage to the next level, we want the Krama to be for you as easy to
get as it is to wear, but we lack the financial means to do so. We trust that,
with your help, we can achieve so much more. If we reach our campaign goal,
this is how we will use the crowdfunding resources:
1)  Pay for fashion exhibitions. Those are the places where fashion designers meet distributors from
all over the world, and each of them costs several thousand euros. We have
built a brand we trust will appeal to distributors, so the more fashion
exhibitions we attend, the more likely you will find Kramas at your-next-door
shop very soon.
2)  Widen the Krama Heritage team. Outside of those fashion exhibitions, we
would like to enlarge our team, hire interns or salespersons to approach the
distributors in the most effective way. 
3)  Turn our website into the worldwide Krama Heritage store. We want to give our website (www.krama-heritage.net  ) a full
revamping for you to be able to purchase the Krama of your choice wherever you
are in the world next September.
4)  Launch new Krama Heritage collections. You might have wondered why there is only one
model in the ‘Les Estivales’ collection! Apart from the minimum order
quantities we have to deal with, we would like our Kramas catalogue to always
reflect your tastes and launch new Kramas collections, in different sizes and
materials 5) Deepen our social project in Cambodia, namely ""The Showcase project - Entrepreneurs & Artists from Cambodia"" whereby we would like to give the opportunity to Cambodian people to pitch in their projects through videos we would showcase, to allow exposure and attract investors. That would require too extra budget.
                                                         Collection ""Tradition""                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Collection ""Les Estivales""

Here’s how you can support
our campaign and be the first to wear your Krama this summer:
1) Select a perk on the right hand side to start your pre-order. You
can select the Krama Heritage bag, a Krama Heritage from the Tradition collection,
the Renaissance collection or the Les Estivales collection at a discounted
price, a Founder Edition Krama Heritage or one of our two Krama Heritage
Designer’s rewards. For the Tradition and Renaissance collections, send us an
email to kramaheritage@gmail.com with the color of your choice.
2) Continue onto the next page to enter shipping information followed
by payment details. Note; if you would like to contribute extra over and
above the cost of the perk you have selected, you can change the figure above.
3) Complete payment via Paypal or using your credit/debit card. 
4) If we run out of our inventory, we aim to deliver your Krama at
the beginning of October 2014.www.krama-heritage.net

Krama Heritage est une marque de foulards parisienne qui a
l’ambition de faire du foulard traditionnel du Cambodge un accessoire de mode
international et de créer de l’impact social au Cambodge. 
Nos deux nouvelles collections ‘Renaissance’ et ‘Les
Estivales’ sont disponibles pour la première fois  à un prix de lancement spécial Indiegogo de
35€ et 45€ avec envoi gratuit partout dans le monde. Choisissez la récompense
de votre choix sur la colonne de droite et pré-commandez votre Krama 
Veuillez noter: Nous
avons une quantité de stock limité pour les envois de juillet. Passez votre
commande rapidement si vous souhaitez être le premier à porter votre Krama cet
été !





                                             


Plus qu’un simple foulard, le Krama est un héritage culturel
qui se transmet de génération en génération et depuis des siècles au Cambodge.
C’est un foulard en coton et à carreaux qui a de nombreux usages dans la vie de
tous les jours : se protéger contre le soleil, porter des enfants contre
l’épaule ou servir de corde pour la collecte du bois. Il a surtout une
symbolique forte comme foulard d’appartenance du peuple Khmer. Il porte les
valeurs de tout un peuple, faites de dignité, courage, optimisme et soif de
vivre.





Le Krama nous est apparu comme le meilleur moyen de partager
notre passion pour le Cambodge et d’agir pour ce pays. Alors que le Cambodge
amorce la reconstruction de sa société, c’est à notre tour d’hériter du foulard
d’appartenance des Khmers, de l’état d’esprit qu’il incarne et d’avoir le
privilège de le porter à leur côté.

                                              


Ajouter au Krama une touche parisienne (mais sans l’altérer
car nous souhaitons que ce soit le même Krama que les Cambodgiens qui soit
porté en dehors du Cambodge) et en le transformer en accessoire de mode nous
permet aujourd’hui de financer un projet social au Cambodge. Ainsi, chaque
Krama Héritage est confectionné par les soins d’un artisan local dans la pure
tradition Khmère, et de façon responsable et soutient l’économie locale à Phnom
Penh.




Parce que nous voulons aussi agir en matière d’éducation au
Cambodge, chaque Krama Héritage contribue au développement de l’ONG Pour un
Sourire d’Enfant – à hauteur de 3€ par Krama Héritage – dont l’action au
Cambodge pour scolariser des enfants est aussi courageuse qu’essentielle.



Un projet entrepreneurial et humain, Krama Héritage est
l’aventure de toute une communauté d’héritiers du Krama, ses porteurs. De Phnom
Penh à Paris, de Paris à New York et Saint-Pétersbourg, ils montrent leur
adhésion au projet en participant à des shootings photos. C’est aussi
l’occasion pour nous d’afficher les travaux des photographes talentueux du
monde entier avec qui nous construisons le projet.

</div>This is Edith Louise.

We are a dynamic French and Finnish duo based in Buenos Aires, Argentina and our mission is to bring a new twist to Latin American lingerie and to propose you a different lingerie experience with innovative designs and perfectly fitted clothing. Nearly two and a half years ago we started with the idea and preparations for the project and now we have finally arrived to the end (or to the beginning?). To make your dream lingerie come alive, we still need a little more help though!

This Indiegogo campaign will allow us to pay the last part of our production and help us set up first sales. Also we'll get to prepare the second collection that is just around the corner! <div><br/></div><div>THE CONCEPT OF THE BRAND </div><div> Edith Louise is for all women who assert their modernity in their daily lives. They work, study, take care of their family, play sports, music or do any artistic activities. They take care of their bodies and nourish their spirits. They have a husband, a boyfriend, they seek true love or just have fun. They are involved in their community's life, have a group of friends with whom they share almost everything ... 

For the open-minded and natural women, Edith Louise offers an elegant and comfortable lingerie collection that fits their lifestyle and does not give up on them when they need it the most. Edith Louise is made by women for women. It is the lingerie of sensual and spontaneous women and a brand for all those women who are not afraid to show themselves as they truly are with their characters, their passions, their weaknesses, their desires. The Edith Louise woman is bold because she feels confident. She knows who she is and what she wants. She claims her simplicity tinged with originality. 

Finally, Edith Louise is the brand ambassador of the French lingerie with its elegance and minimalism. It is the "" dessous chics "" sung by Gainsbourg: it’s the good taste and quality à la française. It is the refinement of cuts and fabrics that enhance the body and make it a tool of seduction. It is the Parisian fashion, the French touch that gives all women the strength to fully embrace their femininity. 

Our most sincere goal is to be able to bring this perspective to Argentina and make a stand out brand designed specificly for you. We defend the values which we believe in and this is reflected in our underwear: modernity, spontaneity, sensuality and elegance await you in our collections and in the whole spirit of the brand. <div> </div>
<div>THE PRODUCTION &amp; MATERIALS </div>
<div> The Edith Louise brand is entirely designed in Europe and adapted to Argentine style and market. We use only the finest and lightest materials that feel like the fashionable second skin you deserve. You do not adapt to Edith Louise, Edith Louise adapts to you. We value sheer and soft materials, that offer the perfect comfort and fit of the garment. Everything is sawn together with great attention to details and quality.

We are asking for your help to complete the investment we put in the first collection, its production and presentation, to bring you our products at their very best. This money will be used to pay our seamstresses the decent wages they deserve for the work, instead of using bigger and cheaper production facilities that will not pay their workers fairly. Our objective is to grow as a team, where all of our partners including fabric providers, producers and pattern drafters to name a few, could expand their work along ours and become an ensemble with no limits.

We will also use the collected money to prepare the next collection and start acquiring new fabrics and making interesting and innovative new prototypes for the future. <p></p>
</div>
<div>We thank you a lot for helping us make this dream come true. If you're interested in our project but can't donate, You can share this Indiegogo campaign or our Facebook page with your friends!</div>

<div>Somos Edith Louise. Somos un dúo dinámico, mitad Francés y mitad Finlandés, con base en Buenos Aires. Nuestra misión es generar un cambio en la lencería de Latinoamerica y brindarte una experiencia de lencería diferente con un diseño innovador y un calce perfecto. Hace casi dos años y medio empezamos con la idea y las preparaciones de este proyecto y recién ahora logramos finalmente realizarlo. Pero, para que tus sueños de lencería se hagan realidad, todavía nos hace falta algo de ayuda! Esta campaña de Indiegogo nos permitirá pagar la ultima parte de nuestra producción y nos ayudara organizar las primeras ventas. También nos permitirá preparar la segunda colección que no esta nada lejos! </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>EL CONCEPTO DE LA MARCA </div>
<div>Edith Louise es para todas las mujeres que afirman su modernidad en su vida diaria. Trabajan, estudian, cuidan su familia, hacen algún deporte, tocan un instrumento o tienen alguna actividad artística. Cuidan sus cuerpos y nutren sus mentes. Tienen un marido, un novio, buscan el amor verdadero o solo se divierten. Se involucran en la vida de su comunidad, tienen un grupo de amigos con los cuales comparten casi todo… Para la mujer abierta y natural, Edith Louise ofrece una colección de lencería elegante y confortable que se adapte a su estilo de vida y no la abandona cuando más lo necesita. Edith Louise está hecho por mujeres, para mujeres. Es la lencería de las mujeres sensuales y espontáneas, es una marca para todas esas mujeres que no tienen miedo a mostrarse tales como son, con sus carácteres, sus pasiones, sus debilidades y sus deseos. La mujer Edith Louise es atrevida porque confía en si misma. Sabe quién es y lo que quiere. Afirma su sensatez con tintas de originalidad. Finalmente, Edith Louise es la marca embajadora de la lencería francesa con su elegancia y su minimalismo. Son los « dessous chics » cantados por Gainsbourg : es el buen gusto y la calidad à la française. Es la finura de los cortes y telas que realzan el cuerpo y lo hacen una herramienta de seducción. Es la moda parisina, el toque francés que da a todas las mujeres la fuerza de abrazar totalmente su feminidad. Nuestro objetivo más sincero es poder brindar esa perspectiva en Argentina y crear una marca fuera de lo común diseñada especialmente para vos. Defendemos los valores en los cuales creemos y esos se reflejan en nuestra lencería: modernidad, espontaneidad, sensualidad y elegancia te esperan en nuestras colecciones y en todo el espíritu de la marca. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>LA PRODUCCION Y LOS INSUMOS </div>
<div>Todos los productos de Edith Louise están diseñados en Europa y adaptados al estilo y al mercado argentino. Utilizamos solo las materias mas finas y livianas que se sienten como la secunda piel hermosa que mereces. No te adaptas a Edith Louise, Edith Louise se adapta a vos. Valoramos las telas sutiles y suaves, que ofrecen la comodidad y el calce perfecto de la prenda. Todas las costuras están hechas con un enfoque particular en los detalles y la calidad. Pedimos tu ayuda para completar la inversión que pusimos en nuestra primera colección, su producción y presentación, para brindarte nuestros productos al máximo de su capacidad. Este dinero va a ser usado para pagar nuestras costureras el sueldo decente que merecen para su trabajo. Preferimos trabajar con ellas que con un taller mas grande y barato que no paga sus empleados de manera adecuada. Nuestro objetivo es crecer como equipo, donde todos nuestros socios, incluso nuestros proveedores de telas, costureras y modelistas, para nombrar solo algunos, podrían desarrollarse a la medida que crecemos para volverse un ensamble sin limite. También utilizaremos el dinero recaudado para preparar nuestra próxima colección y empezar a comprar nuevas telas y a hacer nuevas muestras interesantes e innovadores para el futuro.</div>
<div>Te agradecemos mucho por ayudarnos hacer que este sueño se vuelva realidad. Si nuestro proyecto te interesa pero no podes donar dinero, podes compartir esta campaña de indiegogo o nuestra pagina de Facebook con tus amigos!</div>

The Edith Louise woman is bold because she feels confident. She knows who she is and what she wants. She claims her simplicity tinged with originality. 

Finally, Edith Louise is the brand ambassador of the French lingerie with its elegance and minimalism. It is the "" dessous chics "" sung by Gainsbourg: it’s the good taste and quality à la française. It is the refinement of cuts and fabrics that enhance the body and make it a tool of seduction. It is the Parisian fashion, the French touch that gives all women the strength to fully embrace their femininity. 

Our most sincere goal is to be able to bring this perspective to Argentina and make a stand out brand designed specificly for you. We defend the values which we believe in and this is reflected in our underwear: modernity, spontaneity, sensuality and elegance await you in our collections and in the whole spirit of the brand.  
THE PRODUCTION & MATERIALS 
 The Edith Louise brand is entirely designed in Europe and adapted to Argentine style and market. We use only the finest and lightest materials that feel like the fashionable second skin you deserve. You do not adapt to Edith Louise, Edith Louise adapts to you. We value sheer and soft materials, that offer the perfect comfort and fit of the garment. Everything is sawn together with great attention to details and quality.

We are asking for your help to complete the investment we put in the first collection, its production and presentation, to bring you our products at their very best. This money will be used to pay our seamstresses the decent wages they deserve for the work, instead of using bigger and cheaper production facilities that will not pay their workers fairly. Our objective is to grow as a team, where all of our partners including fabric providers, producers and pattern drafters to name a few, could expand their work along ours and become an ensemble with no limits.

We will also use the collected money to prepare the next collection and start acquiring new fabrics and making interesting and innovative new prototypes for the future. 

We thank you a lot for helping us make this dream come true. If you're interested in our project but can't donate, You can share this Indiegogo campaign or our Facebook page with your friends!

Somos Edith Louise. Somos un dúo dinámico, mitad Francés y mitad Finlandés, con base en Buenos Aires. Nuestra misión es generar un cambio en la lencería de Latinoamerica y brindarte una experiencia de lencería diferente con un diseño innovador y un calce perfecto. Hace casi dos años y medio empezamos con la idea y las preparaciones de este proyecto y recién ahora logramos finalmente realizarlo. Pero, para que tus sueños de lencería se hagan realidad, todavía nos hace falta algo de ayuda! Esta campaña de Indiegogo nos permitirá pagar la ultima parte de nuestra producción y nos ayudara organizar las primeras ventas. También nos permitirá preparar la segunda colección que no esta nada lejos! 

EL CONCEPTO DE LA MARCA 
Edith Louise es para todas las mujeres que afirman su modernidad en su vida diaria. Trabajan, estudian, cuidan su familia, hacen algún deporte, tocan un instrumento o tienen alguna actividad artística. Cuidan sus cuerpos y nutren sus mentes. Tienen un marido, un novio, buscan el amor verdadero o solo se divierten. Se involucran en la vida de su comunidad, tienen un grupo de amigos con los cuales comparten casi todo… Para la mujer abierta y natural, Edith Louise ofrece una colección de lencería elegante y confortable que se adapte a su estilo de vida y no la abandona cuando más lo necesita. Edith Louise está hecho por mujeres, para mujeres. Es la lencería de las mujeres sensuales y espontáneas, es una marca para todas esas mujeres que no tienen miedo a mostrarse tales como son, con sus carácteres, sus pasiones, sus debilidades y sus deseos. La mujer Edith Louise es atrevida porque confía en si misma. Sabe quién es y lo que quiere. Afirma su sensatez con tintas de originalidad. Finalmente, Edith Louise es la marca embajadora de la lencería francesa con su elegancia y su minimalismo. Son los « dessous chics » cantados por Gainsbourg : es el buen gusto y la calidad à la française. Es la finura de los cortes y telas que realzan el cuerpo y lo hacen una herramienta de seducción. Es la moda parisina, el toque francés que da a todas las mujeres la fuerza de abrazar totalmente su feminidad. Nuestro objetivo más sincero es poder brindar esa perspectiva en Argentina y crear una marca fuera de lo común diseñada especialmente para vos. Defendemos los valores en los cuales creemos y esos se reflejan en nuestra lencería: modernidad, espontaneidad, sensualidad y elegancia te esperan en nuestras colecciones y en todo el espíritu de la marca. 

LA PRODUCCION Y LOS INSUMOS 
Todos los productos de Edith Louise están diseñados en Europa y adaptados al estilo y al mercado argentino. Utilizamos solo las materias mas finas y livianas que se sienten como la secunda piel hermosa que mereces. No te adaptas a Edith Louise, Edith Louise se adapta a vos. Valoramos las telas sutiles y suaves, que ofrecen la comodidad y el calce perfecto de la prenda. Todas las costuras están hechas con un enfoque particular en los detalles y la calidad. Pedimos tu ayuda para completar la inversión que pusimos en nuestra primera colección, su producción y presentación, para brindarte nuestros productos al máximo de su capacidad. Este dinero va a ser usado para pagar nuestras costureras el sueldo decente que merecen para su trabajo. Preferimos trabajar con ellas que con un taller mas grande y barato que no paga sus empleados de manera adecuada. Nuestro objetivo es crecer como equipo, donde todos nuestros socios, incluso nuestros proveedores de telas, costureras y modelistas, para nombrar solo algunos, podrían desarrollarse a la medida que crecemos para volverse un ensamble sin limite. También utilizaremos el dinero recaudado para preparar nuestra próxima colección y empezar a comprar nuevas telas y a hacer nuevas muestras interesantes e innovadores para el futuro.
Te agradecemos mucho por ayudarnos hacer que este sueño se vuelva realidad. Si nuestro proyecto te interesa pero no podes donar dinero, podes compartir esta campaña de indiegogo o nuestra pagina de Facebook con tus amigos!",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

I will be leaving Santa Monica in 2 months to go back to Bali and create what all women love,dresses and skirts that they have never seen before.  My designs are all limited editions which means you will never see anybody else wearing what you have on. One size fits all. Never do I want women to think about size .Now here is something else I am exremely passionate about,animals. There is a Foundation in Bali called BAWA.

the time, and freedom of expression is a way of life. It’s in this same spirit
that iKen was created. We believe that each individual is unique, should not
have to hide, and what they wear shouldn’t either. We designed our first
product of build-your-own watches to empower you to say exactly what you want,
the way you want to. </p>

The
word ‘iKen’, pronounced /eee-ken/ means ‘opinion’ and ‘options’ in Japanese.
Our products are bright, bold, can be built to suit your unique style, or built
to represent who/what you stand for. iKen is about being an individual. Being
who you want to be. It’s about being <b>you</b>.<br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/574317/files/20140512114710-iken_shade_specs.PNG?1399920430"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">iKen Shades feature the timeless

1 x frame              2 x arms               2 x lenses
How do the components fit together?
Everything
snaps or clicks together in less than 15 seconds and stays secure until you

Creating the
design


Sourcing
factories


Creating molds


Producing
several versions of prototypes


We're all set
with the design, factory and quality. We now need to raise $20,000
to:


Go in to
production at the required minimum order quantity with our factory at the
negotiated prices


Pay the
mandatory FDA fees for importing eye wear

Produce
additional accessories like pouches and cases for iKen Shades


Create an

specs and the perks we’re offering for your support, please read on!                      The iKen brand was founded New York City, where the status quo is challenged all
the time, and freedom of expression is a way of life. It’s in this same spirit
that iKen was created. We believe that each individual is unique, should not

the way you want to.

word ‘iKen’, pronounced /eee-ken/ means ‘opinion’ and ‘options’ in Japanese.
Our products are bright, bold, can be built to suit your unique style, or built
to represent who/what you stand for. iKen is about being an individual. Being
who you want to be. It’s about being you.iKen Shades feature the timeless
wayfarer style, with interchangeable lenses and arms in your choice of colors.
What are the dimensions?In return for your support, we’re
offering... iKen Shades!We have everything from a simple 'Thank You' to 10 pairs of customized iKen Shades. Have a look at our perks section on the right-hand side.If you can’t pledge, doesn’t mean you can’t help. Please

</div>I want to tryout for the Los Angeles KISS, an Arena Football League team. Since I've gotten myself into shape way back in 2009, I've always regretted not doing it earlier when I had the chance to play high school and possibly college sports. Well this seems to be the perfect opportunity to find out once and for all if a 27 year old pack a day smoker and alcohol enthusiast who likes to think he's in better shape because of those things can cut it with the big boys. You're probably thinking 'He doesn't have a shot in hell' but I have been training fairly intensely for the past two months since I moved to LA. I have ran/walked/hiked over 180 miles in that time averaging about 3 miles a day. I usually do a quick round of circuit training following the runs. I have been doing bikram yoga three days a week for the past month and regular yoga during that time as well. I have a cannon for a left arm and a 6'5"" wingspan and catch anything thrown my way so I would try out for either QB or WR. None of this guarantees I would make the team but part of this money will be used for supplements to ramp up my training regimen over the next three weeks. Mexican steroids are welcome in lieu of cash donations. The rest of the money is for the $85 registration fee, $115 or so for turf shoes and turf gear so I don't get burned up making acrobatic catches all over the field and $100 for training supplements. Any donation will get you a hug or some home cooked food. If I make the team, anyone who donates will receive game tickets if we play anywhere near where you reside. Last but not least, we are recreating an episode from It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia, which is the greatest TV show ever made. We will be tailgating the entire event, serving milk steak boiled over hard and the finest jelly beans, raw,  and things will most likely get weird. I would love for you to join us if you are in the area and if not, it's probably worth it to fly in for this awesome event. The biggest challenge is standing out in what is sure to be a very large crowd of people trying out. I plan to overcome this by being in the best shape possible and putting my 20+ years of football knowledge to good use in the time leading up to the tryout.<p></p></div>","I want to tryout for the Los Angeles KISS, an Arena Football League team.

<p>We had a theory about what a watch should be. Yes it should be affordable, yes it should be stylish, and versatile. But more than that… a watch should blend perfectly into my lifestyle and it should challenge me to a greater lifestyle. So when we set out to create a watch we wanted it to be aspirational; at its core to be... evocative. We wanted to create a brand that represented these ideals. A brand that stood behind our customers and pushed them to greater heights. Now, 1 year after the original idea was conceived I couldn’t be more happy to present the Morveau watch and the Morveau brand.</p>

<p>We require that the watch is of the highest quality, the purchasing decision is a complete experience, and the brand is evocative for the customer.</p>
<p><b>Quality</b>: When designing (and then ultimately building) the watch we spared no expense. Only the finest parts should be used.

Nothing less than the best would do for our watch.</p>
<p><b>Experience</b>: When you make a decision to purchase a watch you become emotionally attached to that decision. It is the brand's responsibility to make your purchasing decision the best decision you could have made in that moment. Our burden is to ensure that when you purchase our watch it is a fully developed experience from before to after the purchase.

<p>It was only 6 months ago that I sat at my desk in my corporate gig day-dreaming about running my own business and life some day. I wasn’t the only one.

<br/><p>I started running the designs by my friends and family, and was just generally getting really excited about the future of this minimalistic watch idea. After a few months I had some initial engineering drawings and things were moving along. It was definitely a steep learning curve and because I was working a 9 to 5 I didn’t have a lot of time to put into developing the product and learning all that watchmaking entails. So I knew the inevitable was coming.  </p>
<p>See, I have this belief that life was not meant to be lived on someone else's terms. If we are truly supposed to seize every moment then the best thing I can do for myself is figure out how to remove the barriers that prevent me from seizing every moment.</p>
<p>For me the barrier was my 9 to 5 job.</p>

</div></div>","If you're viewing this page thinking... ""man I wish I ordered one of those while the campaign was live!""Fret not! You may have missed our Indiegogo campaign but the watches are still available on our website. AND for a limited time they are the same price as they were on Indiegogo. Visit our website here.A little over a year ago I started drawing up rough sketches of a crazy idea I had for a watch that was made almost entirely of reclaimed aluminum.Why aluminum?I was intrigued that many tech products were using aluminum in their design. But when I looked around very few other areas of design were using this fascinating metal. Which was wild because aluminum literally has a story to tell.Aluminum is the most recycled/reused metal in the world. That means the aluminum in a Morveau watch lived a full life before becoming a watch. Each piece could have been expertly crafted by a master artisan into a statue in the 19th century or an airplane during a tide changing campaign in WWII.We wanted to embrace the incredible stories that this metal has to tell within the design of the Morveau watch. This mix of a historied past with new and elegant design is perfect for our wearers who are stylish people looking to live a history worth retelling. You can now choose between sapphire blue, matte black, and/or deep red hands at no additional cost to you. Select any of the existing perk levels...*at the completion of the campaign you will receive a survey asking which color hands you would like. Check out the Morveau Madness perk level to pick up all three colors. Bead-blasted Aluminum - Aircraft grade 6000 series aluminum... an extremely durable yet  lightweight metal. We chose aluminum because of its incredible look, but also because of its resistant durability. Its the perfect metal for a watch that attempts to blend a lifestyle into a physical product. Used nearly entirely throughout the watch design, you’ll see aluminum in the dial, numbers, logo, dashes, hands, crown, and the caseback.Ultra-thin - At 7mm thick, from case back to the top of the domed sapphire crystal glass, Morveau is one of the thinnest watches on the market.Swiss Movement - When it came time to decide on the materials for the Morveau watch we wanted only the highest quality in all aspects. For the movement we spared no expense by choosing an ETA 955-102 movement. It’s no secret that the Swiss make the best watch movements in the world and that is why we chose to work with the highest quality movements made by ETA. Scratch Resistant Sapphire Crystal - The glass is made of anti-reflective scratch resistant sapphire crystal, with the slightest curvature to create an elegant domed glass.Easy Remove Straps - All of Morveau straps are equipped with an easy remove spring bar. You don’t need a tool to replace straps. Since any strap goes effortlessly with the watch design, accessorizing has never been so easy. Get all four straps with your watch body and wear your Morveau during any occasion. (More strap options coming soon.) 


High Quality Leather and Denim - the denim is top of line selvedge denim and the leather full grain, perfectly accented with Morveau's signature sapphire blue stitching. 

Water Resistant - The Morveau watch is water resistant up to 10 meters. Shower? No problem. Washing hands? No problem. Scuba Diving? Leave Morveau at home.
Individually Numbered Custom Caseback - As a special thank you to our backers we've created a custom caseback just for those who back the Morveau watch through Indiegogo. Each watch will be individually numbered as they come off the line. Your caseback will reflect which watch you received. 





We had a theory about what a watch should be. Yes it should be affordable, yes it should be stylish, and versatile. But more than that… a watch should blend perfectly into my lifestyle and it should challenge me to a greater lifestyle. So when we set out to create a watch we wanted it to be aspirational; at its core to be... evocative. We wanted to create a brand that represented these ideals. A brand that stood behind our customers and pushed them to greater heights. Now, 1 year after the original idea was conceived I couldn’t be more happy to present the Morveau watch and the Morveau brand.


This stunning timepiece was built on a desire for excellence. Seeking excellence in developing the Morveau brand took form in 3 unique yet conjoined requirements.
We require that the watch is of the highest quality, the purchasing decision is a complete experience, and the brand is evocative for the customer.
Quality: When designing (and then ultimately building) the watch we spared no expense. Only the finest parts should be used. This is why we insisted on the top of the line aircraft grade aluminum. That’s why there’s a Swiss movement inside the watch instead of a far cheaper Japanese movement. Finally, that’s why we obsessed over every little detail in the build process, sending samples back multiple times until every aspect was perfect. Nothing less than the best would do for our watch.
Experience: When you make a decision to purchase a watch you become emotionally attached to that decision. It is the brand's responsibility to make your purchasing decision the best decision you could have made in that moment. Our burden is to ensure that when you purchase our watch it is a fully developed experience from before to after the purchase. Meaning that you receive assistance before your purchase, ease within the purchase, and lifetime customer service after you are a Morveau brand owner.  
Evocative: You want to achieve greatness. We want to help you achieve greatness. Our desire is that the Morveau brand would evoke a sense of adventure and purpose in your journey.

Think about the time and care required to remove a double stick foam 
tape from a wall hanging when moving out of an apartment or repainting a
 wall.  Same hassle.<br/><br/>Fortunately, some foam tape manufacturers are sensitive to the residual tape issue and have developed specialty grades that can reduce or eliminate its occurrence in certain applications.  After two years of testing and performance evaluations we have identified an ""anisotropic"" foam tape that gets is what we want: excellent bonding strength in the direction of wheel rotation and curb impacts, but releasability from the wheel surface when pulling straight up off the wheel during repairs or removal.<br/><br/>There are tradeoffs though.  The new anisotropic tape requires an adjustment in the plastic material we use as well requiring an upgrade to our production tooling.<br/>These are costs that make sense for us to absorb, but double checking market demand for an ""EZ"" service product is why were doing an Indiegogo campaign.<br/><br/>Raising Indiegogo funding with perks supported by our existing Wheel Bands product, will help defray the costs of upgrading to our Wheel Bands EZ product.  At the same time we'll be verifying the interest we believe exists for an easy to service version of Wheel Bands.  The $7,500 funding target we've set covers 10% of the costs involved with upgrading our tooling and development and performance validation testing on our new EZ tape version.  <br/><br/>If the funding target is not met, we will still be going forward with the production upgrades, just at a slower pace.  We do have the ability to produce Wheel Bands EZ product under pilot production conditions same as we've done to generate product we've generated for field testing.  In the event of under funding on our target, contributors, who choose the $59 Wheel Bands EZ perk will be given the option to wait an additional month or so for pilot build product, or take immediate delivery of our standard product which has an MSRP of $119.  Either way a good deal.<br/><br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Our Team's Story<br/>

 wall.  Same hassle.Fortunately, some foam tape manufacturers are sensitive to the residual tape issue and have developed specialty grades that can reduce or eliminate its occurrence in certain applications.  After two years of testing and performance evaluations we have identified an ""anisotropic"" foam tape that gets is what we want: excellent bonding strength in the direction of wheel rotation and curb impacts, but releasability from the wheel surface when pulling straight up off the wheel during repairs or removal.There are tradeoffs though.  The new anisotropic tape requires an adjustment in the plastic material we use as well requiring an upgrade to our production tooling.These are costs that make sense for us to absorb, but double checking market demand for an ""EZ"" service product is why were doing an Indiegogo campaign.Raising Indiegogo funding with perks supported by our existing Wheel Bands product, will help defray the costs of upgrading to our Wheel Bands EZ product.  At the same time we'll be verifying the interest we believe exists for an easy to service version of Wheel Bands.  The $7,500 funding target we've set covers 10% of the costs involved with upgrading our tooling and development and performance validation testing on our new EZ tape version.  If the funding target is not met, we will still be going forward with the production upgrades, just at a slower pace.  We do have the ability to produce Wheel Bands EZ product under pilot production conditions same as we've done to generate product we've generated for field testing.  In the event of under funding on our target, contributors, who choose the $59 Wheel Bands EZ perk will be given the option to wait an additional month or so for pilot build product, or take immediate delivery of our standard product which has an MSRP of $119.  Either way a good deal.Our Team's Story
RimPro-Tec® Wheel Bands™ manufactured in Michigan were introduced to the North American market at the SEMA 2011 automotive accessories trade show.  We were awarded three prestigious Global Media Awards in 2011 for our new product introduction and one more Media award at SEMA 2012 for a up to 26"" wheel size version of the product.   Our Indiegogo campaign is part of gearing up for more awards at SEMA 2014 for our new Wheel Bands EZ product.   
Debbie and Chris Chester lead our visioneering team.  They're a couple of transplanted entrepreneurial Brits who have been busy launching companies and great new ideas in New Zealand for over 12 years.  Be on the look out for their next up and coming product...It includes peanut flavored vitamin water from New Zealand.  (Hint: If you think that might be only something a dog would love you are on the right track.)
Steve Aiello is our marketing and operations top dog and not just because he's experienced in keeping law and order in a house with two golden retrievers.  Steve has over a decade of experience as an advertising executive handling accounts with divisions of General Motors. 
Jim Capo oversees engineering development and production of Wheel Bands in a manufacturing plant certified to ISO 16949 automotive quality and management standards.  Jim has over 15 years experience running plastic parts factories supplying components for Toyota, Honda and Ford vehicles.  He and his wife Machiko enjoy visiting other people's dogs. 
Greg Aylesworth is our design and packaging tsar though his preferred title is ""Admaster"".  That's the moniker he goes by running his daytime company assuring that Chrysler/Fiat's Mopar and Magneti Marelli parts divisions are using packaging that meets international packaging and distribution requirements.  Greg says he's never needed a dog because, ""Aye, that's what me staff is fer.""  (Greg sometimes wears an eye patch to work and has been know to fly the Jolly Roger on the roof of his design studio.)
We're all happy to take your questions and comments below.  Thanks for reading this far or at least scrolling to the bottom of the page.

<li>Fast fashion encourages consumers to continually buy new pieces and throw out the old. I wanted to create a classic design that wouldn't go out of fashion and could be worn season after season. </li>
<li>Knowing the resources that go into the development and manufacture of these short-lived designs, it was a priority to use a natural and sustainable material with minimal components.</li>
<li>To avoid the waste the industry creates, I needed a simple manufacturing technique that kept waste as low as possible; and, </li>
<li>I wanted to ensure that what I created was accessible to everyone as sustainable products often carry a high price tag.</li>
</ul><p> </p><p>So I took a step away from fast fashion to create a shoe that is kind to the earth AND still affordable. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Hello flipslide</strong></p><p>This is where the concept for Flipslide was born. We decided to create a shoe with the simplicity of the old flip-flop but with a substantial upgrade. </p><p>Flip-flops are affordable and convenient. They’re easy to chuck on and take on holiday, and they can be manufactured with minimal waste using moulds.</p><p>They have a bit going for them, however Flipslide has more.</p><p> <br/><strong>Design and Materials </strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1566099226/kdmm0tkx7cnoyyyxymfg.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Flipslides are super simple, easy to wear and versatile, they basically go with everything.</p><p>The classic clean 2-strap slide design will make them a core piece of your wardrobe that won’t go out of fashion. </p><p>The straps are carefully positioned for comfort and to fit a wide range of feet. They are securely attached to the sole by twistable plugs allowing the fit to be customised to your foot.</p><p>The lack of toe post (the uncomfortable part in between your toes) avoids the blisters as well as the infamous flip-flop blow-outs that leave you stranded on the hot sand.

Fast fashion encourages consumers to continually buy new pieces and throw out the old. I wanted to create a classic design that wouldn't go out of fashion and could be worn season after season. 
Knowing the resources that go into the development and manufacture of these short-lived designs, it was a priority to use a natural and sustainable material with minimal components.
To avoid the waste the industry creates, I needed a simple manufacturing technique that kept waste as low as possible; and, 
I wanted to ensure that what I created was accessible to everyone as sustainable products often carry a high price tag.
 So I took a step away from fast fashion to create a shoe that is kind to the earth AND still affordable.  Hello flipslideThis is where the concept for Flipslide was born. We decided to create a shoe with the simplicity of the old flip-flop but with a substantial upgrade. Flip-flops are affordable and convenient. They’re easy to chuck on and take on holiday, and they can be manufactured with minimal waste using moulds.They have a bit going for them, however Flipslide has more. Design and Materials Flipslides are super simple, easy to wear and versatile, they basically go with everything.The classic clean 2-strap slide design will make them a core piece of your wardrobe that won’t go out of fashion. The straps are carefully positioned for comfort and to fit a wide range of feet. They are securely attached to the sole by twistable plugs allowing the fit to be customised to your foot.The lack of toe post (the uncomfortable part in between your toes) avoids the blisters as well as the infamous flip-flop blow-outs that leave you stranded on the hot sand. You can also chuck Flipslides on with socks; think cold mornings camping, on your way to yoga or when you’ve just forgotten to put the bins out on a wet night.Every Flipslide component is made of natural rubber. It's sustainably sourced from rubber trees as opposed to synthetic rubber made from petroleum or the chemical based polyurethane foam you find in cheap flip-flops which is a major ocean pollutant.Being a natural, renewable material, it’s kind to the environment and your feet. It’s waterproof and durable, whilst dense and elastic for a supportive, soft and comfortable fit. Colours and sizingWe are launching Flipslide in our 3 favourite colourways; eucalyptus green, dusty rose and black. All in a clean matte finish, available in 3 sizes S, M and L which will fit a womens size 36 through to 41. Risks and challengesThe hard work is done, we’ve spent two years sourcing, developing and perfecting Flipslide and are now in bulk production.We’ve overcome the developmental hurdles, have final samples and production is underway.We don’t expect any further speed bumps but we’ll be closely monitoring all aspects of production to ensure a timely delivery. We love questions and feedback, so please don't hesitate to contact us.Flipslide. e: hello@flipslide.com.auw: www.flipslide.com.au ig: www.instagram.com/flipslide_au",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>History</h3>
<p>In 2015, when I crafted the original Tidashi from a rough piece of Titanium stock, I had felt the urge to step away from my computer and design something in a different way. With the use of basic tools, a simple design emerged from my hands.  A small and tactile object that has proven to be more useful in everyday life than I had expected. Along with many of the original adopters, I still use this little cutting tool on a daily basis. It really has withstood the test of time.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556826250/ramu5bb0t0fta4qazsew.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p><i>Rainbow and Midnight</i></p>
<p>The shape and name of the Tidashi is derived from a traditional Japanese utility knife, called Kiridashi-Kogatana; a design recognized by its long handle and short cutting edge. In Japan this tool is still relied upon for making accurate cuts or markings on wood. </p>

<h3>Reiteration</h3>
<p>Over the years, Tidashi users have provided me with feedback. A slight size increase has often been suggested, and I am glad to say that that is exactly what the Tidashi 2.0 is offering, resulting in a more confident grip when using the tool. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556826744/zvbayqgemepuc9y3dhij.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>Evolution</i></p>
<p>A redesigned and more substantial silicone sheath provides just the right amount of friction for securely holding and releasing the Tidashi. It also allows for the use of larger diameter paracord and keyrings, both of which are included. It is still made from the same long lasting silicone material which has held my personal original Tidashi for all these years.</p>

<p><i>Dimensions</i></p>
<p>True to its origins, the Tidashi 2.0 is cut from grade 5 titanium, known for its toughness and corrosion resistance. It is often used in diving knives, as it is lighter than steel and able to resist even the harsh environment of salt water. The fact that this particular alloy lends itself to easy sharpening is something that I have found useful, but not essential to the Tidashi design. It is not a tool for slicing tomatoes. The blade length is simply too short for that. Its forte lies in puncturing and shallow cuts, as done when opening packages. And of course its biggest strength, as with any tool, is the fact that its size allows you to have it on you when you need it. </p>

<p>In order to increase the manufacturing accuracy and consistency of this new iteration of the Tidashi, I have decided to have its basic shape cut by CNC.

<p>The decision to relinquish absolute control over the original Tidashi design by walking away from my computer, is also what guided me in developing a new coloring method for the Tidashi 2.0. I tried to put emphasis on naturally occurring patterns. By subtly controlling the flow of acid and electricity along the surface of the Tidashi, I was able to bring out some unique shapes and colors reminiscent of the cloudy skies over my home in the Sierra Nevada mountains. Although the process is repeatable, no two knives with this pattern will be exactly the same, just like the skies.  I was also able to recreate the original color combinations such as Rainbow and Midnight for a total of ten unique versions for you to choose from.

<p>In the past I have often spent a lot of time and energy on the packaging of my designs. And although a custom box for your Tidashi would be nice, I was recently confronted with the sheer amount of waste I was producing by doing this. In response I have decided to package the Tidashi 2.0 in a more permanent and reusable zippered Cordura pouch. It is lined in a soft plush material to protect your Tidashi not only during shipping, but also if you should choose to store it. The design in not finalized yet, but it will most likely be just like in the picture below.</p>

I also try to answer any and all questions asked in messages and in the comment section. My backers and I have traveled this path from inception to completion several times, and we have seen the highs and lows along the route. The previous project has been especially hard, and it has shown me which pitfalls to avoid in future endeavors, including the project we are embarking on now. I hope you will join us, and make the Tidashi 2.0 project another successful one. </p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>If there is one thing I have learned from my previous project, it is how the complexity of a design can exponentially increase the risk of something going wrong during production. It is the main reason why I chose to keep this design as simple as the original design. It is also why I chose to keep the anodizing process in house. It is a process too delicate to hand off.</p>
<p>The process of manufacturing the basic shape of the Tidashi 2.0 is done by an overseas manufacturer I have worked with in the past. They have been reliable and based on the samples they provided (which are in the pictures you see here) I believe they will provide an excellent product. As the project is going live we are discussing some final details about the cutting process and final finish of the shape. I plan to perform a thorough quality control on the initial small production runs, before increasing the production volume. And if for whatever reason the manufacturer cannot continue production, I can always fall back on the equipment I acquired for making the original Tidashi, and move production in house.</p>
<p>The mold used for creating the silicone sheath has already been made and paid for, because I wanted to show you the result in the pictures. This means that production of the sheaths should not be the bottle neck in this project.</p>
<p>The pouch design is based on an existing design, and the manufacturer has indicated that it is comfortable making it. If problems should arise with the manufacturing, I would not have a problem reverting to the exact design that the manufacturer already makes on a regular basis (the only difference is a slightly different size).</p>
<p>I will be shipping the Tidashis anywhere in the world from the US, and although the declared value of the average shipment will be below the duty threshold of most countries, there is a chance that you will have to pay some import duties, especially on larger shipments. If you have ever ordered anything from abroad, you are probably already aware of this, and know that I have no control over this, other than keeping the declared value to a minimum. <br/><br/>Although the cutting edge of the Tidashi is very short, I want every backer to be aware that there is always the possibility that the laws of your country do not allow you to carry it in public. As far as I am aware, it has never happened in the past.</p>
<p>In summary, I believe that the biggest risk would be delay in the expected delivery date. The reason for this is that definitive information about production quantities will not be available until after the campaign closes. This is a problem that is almost inherent to the Kickstarter system, and we'll work with it.</p>

<p>The product of Manzano-Design is a sophisticated, cleared-out form designed cellphone rack, which was manufactured from wood at the beginning.</p>
<h3><b>Design</b></h3>
<p>Manzano „Wood” revived as a cleared-out docking unit for which we have used beech tree as raw material. We took consumer demands and new trends into consideration, so we’ve created the metal „Alu” version in several colours. Thanks to it’s beautiful lines, we got a visually seductive shape as result, in which our device can always be perfectly in front of our eyes. It offers also a comfortable (in and out) handling to it’s user. It will be a spectacular accessory to your home or office , and it can be a specific gift for someone.</p>

<h3>Our Motivation</h3>
<p>Beyond the pleasurable shape and premium construction, we want to enhance Manzano with charging function.  As we want to stick with the cleared-out desing and practical solutions, the rack will be easily connectable to your own charging unit, so additional cables won’t be necessary.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1019587/files/20141116100145-IMG_5604_copy.jpg?1416160905"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Long term views</h3>
<p>Besides metal we want to expand our modell range with more special materials (e.g. glass and granite). As soon as the wireless function becomes avialable in more and more devices, we are planning to develop the charging function in the rack also.</p>
<p></p>

<p>We at Manzano  are refining our product for more than a year, questing  for the most prepared  workshops, the most professional materials. As we dived deeper in to details, we were getting inspired to present the envisioned shape in various versions. (e.g. carbon decoration) Every minute of our lengthy effort worth it, because we have found the relevant partners and workshops, so now we can start the international selling with a professional team behind us. However, for the start we need YOUR help!</p>

Design
Manzano „Wood” revived as a cleared-out docking unit for which we have used beech tree as raw material. We took consumer demands and new trends into consideration, so we’ve created the metal „Alu” version in several colours. Thanks to it’s beautiful lines, we got a visually seductive shape as result, in which our device can always be perfectly in front of our eyes. It offers also a comfortable (in and out) handling to it’s user. It will be a spectacular accessory to your home or office , and it can be a specific gift for someone.


Our Motivation
Beyond the pleasurable shape and premium construction, we want to enhance Manzano with charging function.  As we want to stick with the cleared-out desing and practical solutions, the rack will be easily connectable to your own charging unit, so additional cables won’t be necessary.

Long term views
Besides metal we want to expand our modell range with more special materials (e.g. glass and granite). As soon as the wireless function becomes avialable in more and more devices, we are planning to develop the charging function in the rack also.


We at Manzano  are refining our product for more than a year, questing  for the most prepared  workshops, the most professional materials. As we dived deeper in to details, we were getting inspired to present the envisioned shape in various versions. (e.g. carbon decoration) Every minute of our lengthy effort worth it, because we have found the relevant partners and workshops, so now we can start the international selling with a professional team behind us. However, for the start we need YOUR help!

<p>Three years ago, you helped us launch XOAB, our vision of comfortable socks in beautiful designs. Since then, thousands of you have enjoyed them.</p>
<p>This time around, we’re introducing something new, XOAB Active compression socks. Here's the quick summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Design forward.</strong> Using our proprietary design software we can create an unprecedented range of patterned compression socks. Great designs, lots of colors, no limits. </li>
<li>
<strong>Guaranteed comfort.</strong> We’ve created a state-of-the-art testing device to verify the fit in complex patterned compression socks, so there’s no guesswork finding the right size. We’ll ask you for a few measurements and send you the right socks.</li>
<li>
<strong>100% Made in the USA.</strong> We design and make all the socks on our own machines from quality materials: American innovation, American materials, American manufacturing. </li>
<li>
<strong>Still kicking!</strong> After three years, we’re still brothers, enjoying inventing and designing. </li>
</ul>
<p>Compression socks have been around a long time, you say? That’s true, but in limited patterns and colors. The long-established compression companies mostly sell socks in three colors, white, flesh-tone and black.</p>
<p>A small number of companies are doing patterned compression socks in the market, and we started this project thinking we could bring our design skills to the party, and offer more choices.</p>
<p>Not so fast. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481560380/gcpprqwwg7u9goeqxcwg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We discovered that the state-of-the-art in measurement tools for compression socks can’t always measure patterned socks accurately. It just wasn’t possible to accurately verify the compression of our complex patterns. That was our first hurdle. </p>
<p>And, the testing devices that were available were only used in labs, sometimes needing weeks to return compression test results on a pair of socks. And that was our second challenge. </p>
<p>In a knitting mill, machine set-up can change from day to day; reproducing exactly what was done on a knitting machine weeks before can be problematic. Stretch will vary across different batches of the same kind of yarn. Some colors dyed from the same batch of yarn stretch differently than other colors. Without an accurate measuring system, one we could use right next to our knitting machines, we couldn’t verify the compression in our patterned socks, much less take advantage of the prototyping speed and versatility afforded by our unique design software. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://info.xoab.us/images/palazzo_float_animation_4a.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>We were made aware of compression socks by a friend and sock industry veteran who wore them exclusively. Rick wore them while working at our mill. The mill floor is concrete, so the knitting machines get a thin layer of plywood under them to reduce vibration. That helps the machines age gracefully - as for the rest of us, not so much. Almost all knitting work is done standing up, and at the end of a long day, wearing compression socks makes a big difference. </p>
<p>Compression socks do their magic by squeezing your legs. (The name “compression” might be a giveaway. :) They can help your legs feel better and you feel less tired by helping your circulatory system move blood, lactic acid, carbon dioxide and excess water from your muscles upward from your feet and lower legs. Travelers also know that compression socks can help keep feet from swelling when flying. For athletes, runners, cyclists, climbers and anyone who fights gravity when they exercise, compression socks may help with performance and recovery.</p>

<p>The challenge we faced was that we needed a measurement device that we could use at the mill, and one that would work on all our patterns. Most current measurement devices, like the one shown in our video, work by measuring the tension of a sock’s fabric, and use a simplified form of a partial differential equation known as the Young-Laplace equation to infer the pressure on a theoretical leg from that sock. The catch is that unless a sock has a flat, solid-color area where the device’s sensor measures tension, the sock’s pattern can disrupt the tension readings. And, these testing devices are expensive; the only ones we have access to are in third-party testing labs.</p>
<p>So we started tinkering, and built our own tester. The solution we came up with is to read a sock’s pressure directly, without the need for the tension-to-pressure conversion. We use a sensitive electronic pressure transducer attached to an air-filled rubber tube around a “measurement disk.” Each measurement disk is sized to a precise outer circumference, and reports how much a sock is squeezing that disk. We then stack up a “leg” of these measurement disks, where each disk’s outer circumference corresponds to either a segment of an industry standard leg or of a specific person’s leg. We connect our stack of measurement disks to a computer and we can read the exact pressure curve for a sock. We use the pressure data from the device to modify the parameters in the knitting machine program, and correct any pressure variation from the ideal sock we wanted to knit.</p>

<p>Because our device is easy to use, and can quickly take a pressure reading from any sock, we can also use it to start answering questions about compression socks that nobody knows the answers to yet, because of the difficulty in getting them tested. We’re looking forward to understanding how our socks change from when you put them on in the morning until you take them off at night, or how the socks change over many wearings and washings.</p>

<p>To work well, compression socks are “graduated,” meaning they are tighter at your foot and ankle, and “gradually” get looser towards your calf. It’s the smooth reduction in pressure, from bottom to top, that make them effective. </p>
<p>The pressure of compression socks is measured in “millimeters of mercury,” the same units of measurement used for your blood pressure. It’s abbreviated “mmHg.” (“Hg” is the symbol for the metal mercury, from its New Latin name, hydrargyrum, which means ""liquid silver."" In the dark ages, before dials, lights and Netflix, pressure gauges were made from a glass tube, filled with a column of mercury, and the scale next to the tube was a millimeter ruler.)</p>
<p>If your blood pressure reading is 120/80, for instance, that’s a pressure of 120 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) when your heart beats, and 80 mmHg when your heart is resting. Compression socks, for normal, non-medical use, exert considerably less pressure than your blood pressure, so blood will still flow easily in your legs.</p>
<p>Compression socks are categorized by the amount of pressure they apply at their tightest point, which is at the ankle. Because peoples’ legs vary in size, the same sock might be tighter if your ankle is larger, or less tight if your ankle is slimmer. We’ve chosen to make our standard socks 15-20 mmHg at the ankle. That means that depending on the size of your foot and ankle, we will provide socks that compress your ankle with a pressure somewhere between 15 and 20 mmHg. The top of our socks, at the largest part of the calf, will be about 30-35% less pressure, depending on the size of your calf, gradually lessening from the 15-20 mmHg at the ankle.</p>
<p>(For those of you wanting other pressures, or if you want a more precise fit, exactly customized to your legs, see our “Individual custom sizing reward,” below. They cost more, but we will work with you to achieve a perfect compression gradient for the shape of your legs.)</p>

<p>In return for helping us get our testing invention off the ground, you get the very first compression socks we make, in a size that fits you. You'll be able to pick from among the designs we show here, plus any that we add over the course of the project. You can mix and match any of these designs for your reward. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481561596/wth9pnjdtt6r90xvzfyo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The compression socks for this project will be knit from US-grown and spun Supima® combed cotton and 18.5 micron American Merino wool.</p>
<h3>A custom design for your team or group</h3>
<p>For $2,000, we will knit five dozen pairs of compression socks for your peloton of cyclists, ward of nurses, courtroom of lawyers or any other pod, gaggle or herd. Neil will work with you to adapt your design to be a successful compression sock pattern, or he can create a design from the ideas and artwork you provide. We'll provide a sample of the finished sock for your approval, and then we'll knit the socks in the specific sizes needed by everyone in your group. (Yes, we'll need to collect some measurements from them, but we’ll give you a custom on-line survey for that.) $2,000 is $33 and change per pair, which is much less than our single-pair price for this project.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481561695/mwdhvbzkrku7j6d4rfzf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Sizing</h3>
<p>Have you ever been frustrated with a size chart, and end up guessing which size to buy? Us too. While we’ll be producing “standard” sizes in our compression socks, for this project we decided to help with that. Instead of giving you a size chart, we’re going to ask for a few measurements of your foot and leg. Using those measurements, we’ll choose the right size compression socks for you, from our standard range.</p>
<p>Sizing compression socks is a little more complicated than regular socks. With regular socks, we can usually guide you to the correct sock size if we know your shoe size. Unfortunately, the compression in socks, ie how much they squeeze your leg, changes depending on the size of your leg and your height, not just your shoe size.</p>
<p>We’re going to have several “standard” sizes ; variations for smaller and larger feet, smaller and larger calves, and shorter and taller people. But you don’t have to worry about guessing the correct size – we’ll use your measurements, and make sure you get socks that fit. In the process, you’ll be helping us fine-tune our sizing, adjusting the size ranges to make sure we can fit all your feet.</p>
<p>(We guarantee the sizing. It’s part of our unconditional guarantee. If you don’t think they fit, we’ll fix ‘em.)</p>
<h3>New designs but no stretch goals</h3>
<p>If you’ve backed other apparel corwdfunding projects, you’ll have noticed that projects frequently offer new designs or colors as stretch goals. Most apparel projects need to secure enough pre-orders to justify ordering a minimum quantity of each design. For socks, those minimums might be thousands of pairs for each design, possibly thousands in each different color combination.</p>
<p>We’re not offering new designs as stretch goals, simply because adding new designs is something we do easily, without minimums. Any of you who have seen our monthly First Editions subscription offerings know that we create new designs easily, in lots of colorways, and can decide exactly how many we knit at a time.</p>
<p>What we guarantee for this project is that you’ll be able to choose from any of the compression designs you see here. In addition, by the time we ask you to choose your socks, we’ll even have more possibilities for you to pick from. We’ve included some of your favorite patterns from our regular line and we may offer new ones in addition to what you see here. If there are colors, patterns or styles you’d like to see, please let us know! One of the things we like about project is the wealth of suggestions and ideas you bring to us!</p>
<p>With four knitting machines, we have the capacity to scale our manufacturing to accommodate the volume this campaign may generate. Although we may be adding more designs to the offerings for this project, we will not go beyond a point where any added complexity would jeopardize timely fulfillment.</p>
<h3>Delivering your socks</h3>
<p>This time around, we’re packaging socks in envelopes, rather than gift boxes, to reduce some packaging and weight. Shipping to the US is included in the price of your reward.</p>
<p>The international shipping rates for our last project were a bit steep: the costs for packages ranged from $10 to more than $30. Since almost 30% of backers for our first project lived outside the US, we don’t feel comfortable up-charging for all the shipping, especially since we’re covering US postage. As a compromise, we’re going to split the shipping with our international backers – the shipping fee we’ve added for international delivery should cover half our expenses, and we’ll spot you for the rest.</p>
<h3>You might get your socks in multiple packages</h3>
<p>If you choose a reward with more than one pair of socks, we may not wait until we knit all your socks to send you some. As backers from our first project may remember, we shipped more than 360 variations of pattern, color, fiber and size last time – and every possible variation was chosen by at least one backer! We ended up having to make all your socks before we could ship any, resulting in frustrating delays for you and for us.</p>
<p>We’re not doing that again! This time, if we have some socks made for you, we’re going to ship them, and you might get more than one delivery. Shipping to US backers is still free, no matter how many packages we send you. For international backers, the one-time fee is all you’ll pay, even if we send your socks in more than one bundle.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481561882/si8rmkymoh9y3ojxqxll.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Ever notice that many sock companies do design and marketing but don’t knit their own socks? We discovered early on that we needed to have more control over our manufacturing than we could get from an arms-length relationship with a knitting mill.</p>
<p>The typical out-sourcing process for socks starts with a designer creating a rough sketch of a sock design, and sending it to a contract knitting mill, sometimes in the US, but more likely overseas. For more complex patterns, at the mill, a programmer reworks the design, often simplifying it to run on a knitting machine. Then, the programmer will give the design program to a knitter, specifying colors from the mill’s yarn inventory. The end result is an approximation of a designer’s intent, but very often more of a compromise than the designer would like.</p>
<p>To make our socks, we had to import our own custom-modified knitting machines, develop design and analysis software to help make Neil’s designs knit well, source high-quality undyed cotton and wool yarn, dye a wide range of colors and learn how to run small batches of socks quickly and efficiently. It’s not possible to produce our socks if we contract out our manufacturing. Our innovation and quality stem directly from our hands on approach, so the socks we make are precisely the ones Neil intended.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481561916/zid4gj9rughoyclmclsd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Neil and I are reminded every day that we’re standing on the shoulders of many talented people who have helped us and advised us since we started XOAB. They’ve kept us going, on track, and encouraged us not to quit when we’ve been feeling discouraged.</p>
<p>Dan St. Louis and Tony Whitener at the Manufacturing Solutions Center, in Conover, NC continue to be our go-to experts on the sock industry. When we’ve had questions, we’ve ended up on their doorstep time and again, and they keep answering. Thank you. </p>
<p>Next, we have to thank our loyal customers for taking a chance on a fledgling sock company, sticking with us, and spreading the word as we've worked on perfecting what many of you have told us to be the best socks you own. We rely on your feedback and gentle encouragement to improve what we do - please don't stop letting us know what you think!</p>
<p>We continue to rely on KentWool in Pickens, SC and Buhler Quality Yarns in Jefferson, GA for spinning the undyed yarn we use to make our socks. Lucy Reynolds and Tim Manson at Meridian Specialty Yarns make it possible to dye our amazing colors. Andy Rhoney and the team at Catawba Paper Box create our exquisite gift boxes. </p>
<p>Our knitting machines from Gianmario Busi and his team in Brescia run sock after sock, and live up daily to their reputation as the best pattern sock machines in the world.</p>
<p>Chris Crowley, Bob Nichols and Dean Miller provided invaluable mechanical and electrical design work to get our prototype tester off the ground. Naomi Levine provided CAD assistance to get our prototyping started. We printed and cut legions of parts for our prototypes and experiments at TechShop in San Jose.</p>
<p>Brian McKinney’s consummate skill created the software systems at the core of our business, and made it possible to run XOAB across 3,000 miles of US geography.</p>
<p>We’re incredibly grateful to Mike Pope and Martha Holmes, who keep our mill and machines running, organize us, and almost always say yes to our off-the-wall ideas for socks and designs. (And when Rick comes up with a new, hare-brained knitting technique, they almost always don’t mean it when they say “don’t let Neil know about that.” :)</p>
<p>For this project, our theme song is again the track ""Looking For a River"" by Hannah Alkire and Joe Scott of <a href=""http://www.acousticeidolon.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Acoustic Eidolon</a>. We can’t get it out of our heads! Their latest album, ""A Tree Finds Its Voice"" showcases the incredible pair of new instruments made for them from one piece of wood, and will be out in late October.</p>
<p>David Levine recorded the narration for our video, and did the final audio mix.</p>
<p>Karen Kuhn is the creative powerhouse behind all the lifestyle photography of our socks; her wonderful eye for color and form yields magical images. </p>
<p>Sarah Levine consulted on the use of compression socks in microgravity environments and provided bicycling images.</p>
<p>Next to last, we thank our family – Sue for putting up with Rick’s entrepreneurial proclivities and our mom, Myra Levine for believing in us and suggesting we work together. We still wish our dad was around to see what we’re doing; he’d love it.</p>
<p>And finally, thanks to each other. Without each other, none of this would be possible; brothers are nice to have.</p>
<h2>Risks and challenges</h2>
<p>This is our second crowdfunding project. Our first one was quite a ride, and we learned a lot from the experience! We delivered more than 6,000 pairs of socks, spread out over 336 separate design, colorway, yarn and size variations, to more than 1,200 backers in more than 30 countries.</p>
<p>This time around, we’re more sure of our sock knitting chops, and very comfortable with the nuts and bolts of running a high quality sock business. We’ve improved our knitting processes and tools, and we’ve taken much of your feedback to heart, and made improvements to our socks, like more heel and toe reinforcement and tweaks to sizing. We started the last project with only one knitting machine in production, and now we have four running, with a four-fold increase in our daily production capacity.</p>
<p>We’re also taking a few steps to simplify our work for this project. First, we’re not going to produce as many variations, which simplifies our manufacturing work. Second, we’re going to ship socks to you in envelopes, rather than gift boxes, to save shipping cost and packing material.</p>
<p>And, we’re not going to wait until we’ve knit all the socks if you choose a multi-sock reward; you’ll very likely get more than one shipment from us, to get you socks sooner. (With no extra shipping charge to you.)</p>
<p>We’re sure we’ll hit some snags along the way – we’re trying something new, and still developing some of the techniques we’ll use to produce and test our compression socks. However, backers of our first project have already experienced our persistence firsthand. We don’t quit. We’ve been told by one kind backer that we’re not really a sock business, but a customer service company that happens to sell socks. We’re very intent on keeping our focus on service and on your complete happiness with our socks, and hope you’ll join us in our newest venture, making the most comfortable, beautiful compression socks in the world.</p>
</div></div>","Three years ago, you helped us launch XOAB, our vision of comfortable socks in beautiful designs. Since then, thousands of you have enjoyed them.
This time around, we’re introducing something new, XOAB Active compression socks. Here's the quick summary:


Design forward. Using our proprietary design software we can create an unprecedented range of patterned compression socks. Great designs, lots of colors, no limits. 

Guaranteed comfort. We’ve created a state-of-the-art testing device to verify the fit in complex patterned compression socks, so there’s no guesswork finding the right size. We’ll ask you for a few measurements and send you the right socks.

100% Made in the USA. We design and make all the socks on our own machines from quality materials: American innovation, American materials, American manufacturing. 

Still kicking! After three years, we’re still brothers, enjoying inventing and designing. 

Compression socks have been around a long time, you say? That’s true, but in limited patterns and colors. The long-established compression companies mostly sell socks in three colors, white, flesh-tone and black.
A small number of companies are doing patterned compression socks in the market, and we started this project thinking we could bring our design skills to the party, and offer more choices.
Not so fast. 

We discovered that the state-of-the-art in measurement tools for compression socks can’t always measure patterned socks accurately. It just wasn’t possible to accurately verify the compression of our complex patterns. That was our first hurdle. 
And, the testing devices that were available were only used in labs, sometimes needing weeks to return compression test results on a pair of socks. And that was our second challenge. 
In a knitting mill, machine set-up can change from day to day; reproducing exactly what was done on a knitting machine weeks before can be problematic. Stretch will vary across different batches of the same kind of yarn. Some colors dyed from the same batch of yarn stretch differently than other colors. Without an accurate measuring system, one we could use right next to our knitting machines, we couldn’t verify the compression in our patterned socks, much less take advantage of the prototyping speed and versatility afforded by our unique design software. 
 
  
Our software analyzes a pattern and creates a knitting machine program to eliminate float threads, allowing the sock to stretch. 
In 2015, we were granted a patent on our process for analyzing complex sock patterns and redesigning them so they stretch enough for all sizes of legs. That process  turned out to be more important than we realized, as the float threads in patterns interfere with the compression applied by a sock, and make accurate compression measurements more difficult. 
Over the last two years, with a lot of trial and error, we’ve created a device we can use to measure any of our patterned socks accurately, and it can be used at the mill, next to our knitting machines.

 

 

We were made aware of compression socks by a friend and sock industry veteran who wore them exclusively. Rick wore them while working at our mill. The mill floor is concrete, so the knitting machines get a thin layer of plywood under them to reduce vibration. That helps the machines age gracefully - as for the rest of us, not so much. Almost all knitting work is done standing up, and at the end of a long day, wearing compression socks makes a big difference. 
Compression socks do their magic by squeezing your legs. (The name “compression” might be a giveaway. :) They can help your legs feel better and you feel less tired by helping your circulatory system move blood, lactic acid, carbon dioxide and excess water from your muscles upward from your feet and lower legs. Travelers also know that compression socks can help keep feet from swelling when flying. For athletes, runners, cyclists, climbers and anyone who fights gravity when they exercise, compression socks may help with performance and recovery.
 

The challenge we faced was that we needed a measurement device that we could use at the mill, and one that would work on all our patterns. Most current measurement devices, like the one shown in our video, work by measuring the tension of a sock’s fabric, and use a simplified form of a partial differential equation known as the Young-Laplace equation to infer the pressure on a theoretical leg from that sock. The catch is that unless a sock has a flat, solid-color area where the device’s sensor measures tension, the sock’s pattern can disrupt the tension readings.

Because our device is easy to use, and can quickly take a pressure reading from any sock, we can also use it to start answering questions about compression socks that nobody knows the answers to yet, because of the difficulty in getting them tested. We’re looking forward to understanding how our socks change from when you put them on in the morning until you take them off at night, or how the socks change over many wearings and washings.
 

CAD drawing, 3D printing and sealed, completed ""caterpillar"" connectors for the pressure tubes in the disk units.
So far, we’ve built lots of prototypes, and have our first working “leg.” With your support, we’ll be able to create a range of interchangeable disks and several measurement legs. We’ll be fine-tuning the usability of the device, working on our software to read the measurements, and integrating the pressure measurements into our knitting workflow.

Sizing
Have you ever been frustrated with a size chart, and end up guessing which size to buy? Us too. While we’ll be producing “standard” sizes in our compression socks, for this project we decided to help with that. Instead of giving you a size chart, we’re going to ask for a few measurements of your foot and leg. Using those measurements, we’ll choose the right size compression socks for you, from our standard range.
Sizing compression socks is a little more complicated than regular socks. With regular socks, we can usually guide you to the correct sock size if we know your shoe size. Unfortunately, the compression in socks, ie how much they squeeze your leg, changes depending on the size of your leg and your height, not just your shoe size.
We’re going to have several “standard” sizes ; variations for smaller and larger feet, smaller and larger calves, and shorter and taller people. But you don’t have to worry about guessing the correct size – we’ll use your measurements, and make sure you get socks that fit. In the process, you’ll be helping us fine-tune our sizing, adjusting the size ranges to make sure we can fit all your feet.
(We guarantee the sizing. It’s part of our unconditional guarantee. If you don’t think they fit, we’ll fix ‘em.)
New designs but no stretch goals
If you’ve backed other apparel corwdfunding projects, you’ll have noticed that projects frequently offer new designs or colors as stretch goals. Most apparel projects need to secure enough pre-orders to justify ordering a minimum quantity of each design. For socks, those minimums might be thousands of pairs for each design, possibly thousands in each different color combination.
We’re not offering new designs as stretch goals, simply because adding new designs is something we do easily, without minimums. Any of you who have seen our monthly First Editions subscription offerings know that we create new designs easily, in lots of colorways, and can decide exactly how many we knit at a time.
What we guarantee for this project is that you’ll be able to choose from any of the compression designs you see here. In addition, by the time we ask you to choose your socks, we’ll even have more possibilities for you to pick from. We’ve included some of your favorite patterns from our regular line and we may offer new ones in addition to what you see here. If there are colors, patterns or styles you’d like to see, please let us know! One of the things we like about project is the wealth of suggestions and ideas you bring to us!
With four knitting machines, we have the capacity to scale our manufacturing to accommodate the volume this campaign may generate. Although we may be adding more designs to the offerings for this project, we will not go beyond a point where any added complexity would jeopardize timely fulfillment.
Delivering your socks
This time around, we’re packaging socks in envelopes, rather than gift boxes, to reduce some packaging and weight. Shipping to the US is included in the price of your reward.
The international shipping rates for our last project were a bit steep: the costs for packages ranged from $10 to more than $30. Since almost 30% of backers for our first project lived outside the US, we don’t feel comfortable up-charging for all the shipping, especially since we’re covering US postage. As a compromise, we’re going to split the shipping with our international backers – the shipping fee we’ve added for international delivery should cover half our expenses, and we’ll spot you for the rest.
You might get your socks in multiple packages
If you choose a reward with more than one pair of socks, we may not wait until we knit all your socks to send you some. As backers from our first project may remember, we shipped more than 360 variations of pattern, color, fiber and size last time – and every possible variation was chosen by at least one backer! We ended up having to make all your socks before we could ship any, resulting in frustrating delays for you and for us.
We’re not doing that again! This time, if we have some socks made for you, we’re going to ship them, and you might get more than one delivery. Shipping to US backers is still free, no matter how many packages we send you. For international backers, the one-time fee is all you’ll pay, even if we send your socks in more than one bundle.

Ever notice that many sock companies do design and marketing but don’t knit their own socks? We discovered early on that we needed to have more control over our manufacturing than we could get from an arms-length relationship with a knitting mill.
The typical out-sourcing process for socks starts with a designer creating a rough sketch of a sock design, and sending it to a contract knitting mill, sometimes in the US, but more likely overseas. For more complex patterns, at the mill, a programmer reworks the design, often simplifying it to run on a knitting machine. Then, the programmer will give the design program to a knitter, specifying colors from the mill’s yarn inventory. The end result is an approximation of a designer’s intent, but very often more of a compromise than the designer would like.
To make our socks, we had to import our own custom-modified knitting machines, develop design and analysis software to help make Neil’s designs knit well, source high-quality undyed cotton and wool yarn, dye a wide range of colors and learn how to run small batches of socks quickly and efficiently. It’s not possible to produce our socks if we contract out our manufacturing. Our innovation and quality stem directly from our hands on approach, so the socks we make are precisely the ones Neil intended.

Neil and I are reminded every day that we’re standing on the shoulders of many talented people who have helped us and advised us since we started XOAB. They’ve kept us going, on track, and encouraged us not to quit when we’ve been feeling discouraged.
Dan St. Louis and Tony Whitener at the Manufacturing Solutions Center, in Conover, NC continue to be our go-to experts on the sock industry. When we’ve had questions, we’ve ended up on their doorstep time and again, and they keep answering. Thank you. 
Next, we have to thank our loyal customers for taking a chance on a fledgling sock company, sticking with us, and spreading the word as we've worked on perfecting what many of you have told us to be the best socks you own. We rely on your feedback and gentle encouragement to improve what we do - please don't stop letting us know what you think!
We continue to rely on KentWool in Pickens, SC and Buhler Quality Yarns in Jefferson, GA for spinning the undyed yarn we use to make our socks. Lucy Reynolds and Tim Manson at Meridian Specialty Yarns make it possible to dye our amazing colors. Andy Rhoney and the team at Catawba Paper Box create our exquisite gift boxes. 
Our knitting machines from Gianmario Busi and his team in Brescia run sock after sock, and live up daily to their reputation as the best pattern sock machines in the world.
Chris Crowley, Bob Nichols and Dean Miller provided invaluable mechanical and electrical design work to get our prototype tester off the ground. Naomi Levine provided CAD assistance to get our prototyping started. We printed and cut legions of parts for our prototypes and experiments at TechShop in San Jose.
Brian McKinney’s consummate skill created the software systems at the core of our business, and made it possible to run XOAB across 3,000 miles of US geography.
We’re incredibly grateful to Mike Pope and Martha Holmes, who keep our mill and machines running, organize us, and almost always say yes to our off-the-wall ideas for socks and designs. (And when Rick comes up with a new, hare-brained knitting technique, they almost always don’t mean it when they say “don’t let Neil know about that.” :)
For this project, our theme song is again the track ""Looking For a River"" by Hannah Alkire and Joe Scott of Acoustic Eidolon. We can’t get it out of our heads! Their latest album, ""A Tree Finds Its Voice"" showcases the incredible pair of new instruments made for them from one piece of wood, and will be out in late October.
David Levine recorded the narration for our video, and did the final audio mix.
Karen Kuhn is the creative powerhouse behind all the lifestyle photography of our socks; her wonderful eye for color and form yields magical images. 
Sarah Levine consulted on the use of compression socks in microgravity environments and provided bicycling images.
Next to last, we thank our family – Sue for putting up with Rick’s entrepreneurial proclivities and our mom, Myra Levine for believing in us and suggesting we work together. We still wish our dad was around to see what we’re doing; he’d love it.
And finally, thanks to each other. Without each other, none of this would be possible; brothers are nice to have.
Risks and challenges
This is our second crowdfunding project. Our first one was quite a ride, and we learned a lot from the experience! We delivered more than 6,000 pairs of socks, spread out over 336 separate design, colorway, yarn and size variations, to more than 1,200 backers in more than 30 countries.
This time around, we’re more sure of our sock knitting chops, and very comfortable with the nuts and bolts of running a high quality sock business. We’ve improved our knitting processes and tools, and we’ve taken much of your feedback to heart, and made improvements to our socks, like more heel and toe reinforcement and tweaks to sizing. We started the last project with only one knitting machine in production, and now we have four running, with a four-fold increase in our daily production capacity.
We’re also taking a few steps to simplify our work for this project. First, we’re not going to produce as many variations, which simplifies our manufacturing work. Second, we’re going to ship socks to you in envelopes, rather than gift boxes, to save shipping cost and packing material.
And, we’re not going to wait until we’ve knit all the socks if you choose a multi-sock reward; you’ll very likely get more than one shipment from us, to get you socks sooner. (With no extra shipping charge to you.)
We’re sure we’ll hit some snags along the way – we’re trying something new, and still developing some of the techniques we’ll use to produce and test our compression socks. However, backers of our first project have already experienced our persistence firsthand. We don’t quit. We’ve been told by one kind backer that we’re not really a sock business, but a customer service company that happens to sell socks. We’re very intent on keeping our focus on service and on your complete happiness with our socks, and hope you’ll join us in our newest venture, making the most comfortable, beautiful compression socks in the world.",15.0,0,"1 Campaign

He has the key success of knowledge and experience that I need.During my way of exploring and collecting data for this new business idea,  Jona also joined our team, a marketing partner, who has taken care of development and presentation of our project, sharing fresh new ideas for the way of conception and transmission our startup to the audience. So we put together a team, with passion and dedicated work, based on this three basic foundations as: design(modern) , affordable(economic) & quality(experience).We share the same vision that “Something made out of love, won’t get lost or underestimated”.We guarantee you that our handmade MartinWalkers are made with lots of love and passion. We have dedicated everything more than two years on creating high quality shoes, but with fair prices. Risk and ChallengesDuring our way, as many other new startups, we had a lot of up’s and down’s. The biggest challenge was finding the best suppliers, who accept small orders, but at the same time comply with our vision and values.Another one, was trusting our production in small artisan family owned factories, which share the same passion and dedication for handmade shoes. We do not accept compromises on the quality of raw materials and manufacturing. This is the key of our success, which we are competing with other brands.Last but not least, another big challenge was financial capital. As we know, in most of production fields and not only, founders need capital for the first orders and the launch of a new startup line.We have trusted our work to Indiegogo community, hoping that we will get your support on bringing our first brand line to life. At this way we can start the production and shipping around the world.Thank you for allowing us to do what we love and for spreading the word. Thank you for trusting us.Martin Walker Team Don’t worry to much about size and color right now. You have plenty of time to make up your mind. At the end of the campaign our team will contact each of our backers.Take a look below !  HEY YOU, LITTLE REMINDER: ""LIFE IS SHORT, BUY THE SHOES""Zoom your favorite and back us now !",61.0,0,"1 Campaign

Wearable art from code, inspired by Chemistry and Physics! Art you can wear! These gorgeous scarves are printed with Generative Artworks created with code, inspired by Chemistry and Physics. With code, I create particle systems. As the simulation runs, the particles bump into each other, changing and growing. The patterns, shapes and colors,  slowly emerge like a blooming garden. 




It all started when I was developing chemistry animations for students. 
The particles each have their own 'atomic number', which determines how 
it interacts with other particles in the system.  Hydrogen atoms bound 
with Oxygen atoms to form water molecules, and so on.   What We Need & What You Get


First goal: produce a range of generative art scarves inspired by Chemistry, Physics, and Mathematics.

Stretch goal: produce clothing from textiles inspired by Chemistry, Physics, and Mathematics.
Funding Needs:

Starting with minimal funding goals, so that we can produce the scarves and offer them in the Indiegogo InDemand market. 

By printing scarves on-demand with a local textile printer, we can deliver all perks, even if we don't meet our funding goal. 

Stretch goal:  produce quantity with costs that allow whole-sale prices so that we can be carried by small boutiques. 


Perks:

Wearable Art Perks!

    


Coloring books & Art postcard Perks!

About me and my Art

With code, I create art inspired by Chemistry and 
Physics: Generative Art. It's been shown in galleries and events from San Francisco to  
Scarborough, UK.

Past projects include myCitySounds, and art installation I developed as a fellow at Stamen and Gray Area.

We created GLIGO to do just that. No crazy/flashy UX and alerts that never stop. We only keep track of the most important things for you throughout the day: check time, meeting reminder, and a little bit of health monitoring and fitness tracking.  While giving you the most comfortable watch-reading experience, GLIGO also has unprecedentedly long battery life. Different from most of the smartwatches on the market that require charges daily, we adopted an energy-efficient dual-core design: the quartz core has a battery life of up to two years, e-ink screen has a battery life of up to 180 days.

 
We strive for simplicity and functionality, and always with style. With GLIGO, you can focus on the things you care the most about. GLIGO’s screen is e-ink, and there is no reflection under the sun like traditional liquid crystal displays have. And it only consumes energy when screen color changes (e.g., switching from black to white). After turning off, images on screen remain, hence very energy-efficient. Another advantage of e-ink screen over traditional liquid crystal display is that it is easy to read. E-ink looks like printed text, making it easier for eyes.​ -Press the bottom-right button on GLIGO and switch between black and white screens freely. Given your environment, choose mature black or chic white.The watch has a two-pin design and is equipped with quartz movement. The e-ink screen displays time, date, and notification icons.GLIGO’s waterproof body can withstand depths up to 30 meters. So now you don't have to worry about taking off your watch when you're showering, at the beach, or working out.Let us first introduce to you the reminder functions under four innovative scenarios. Mobile phone reminders are automatically synced to the watch, and the e-ink screen will display the reminder in different time intervals. For example, if you have an important meeting between 10 am, and 12 pm, the outer circle between 10 and 12 will show white, reminding you that there is a meeting during this period.The display is black or white background; there are agendas reminder lines for next 12 hours (as you see, there are lines around the display edge, when your calendar has tasks in those hours, the display will show a range at that hour).You can set and view your full daily schedule easily. As shown in image above, the watch face shows that you have some upcoming appointments at 11:50 AM, 14:30 PM and 18:30 PM.The screen background is black or white; there’s a ring around the display edge which we called sports amount ring, it goes as your sports amount increase until you fulfill your target sports amount which is set through mobile App.Black or white background, the display shows a digital time or date, which is in sync with your mobile phone time or date through the mobile phone app. So when you travel to different time zone, the display can show time of different time zones.When you have traveled to France from American, GLIGO’s quartz hands show the local current time in US (e.g. 10:10 AM) and its face shows the local current time in French (3:10 PM) at the same time. And it also can show the date in French (Oct. 10th).GLIGO features email alerts, call alerts, and application alerts so that you have to take out your mobile phone or notebook to check them. Life can be simple and easier.The GliGo Watch application allows your GLIGO to connect seamlessly with your phone, enabling you to access stored information in real time, use your GLIGO to take pictures, and program your reminders as well as your mode choices.Quick, convenient magnetic charging technology can be used to provide charging power to the E-ink screen alone; the quartz core has a battery life of up to 2 years.Robust body with streamline makes this smart watch resistant to high temperature, corrosion and tear and wear, allowing for a long lasting use.Do sports with GLIGO. It tracks everything from your steps, running distance and heart rate. It can also remind you to take a rest. Its sleep monitor tracks your sleep patterns - when you go to sleep and wake up.There are two different styles for you to choose from: Classic Leather or Stylish Milanese, don't miss the opportunity to show your style.All silver design fits the most occasions",55.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p>My name is Amy and I started Bow Wow Couture with the last $20 I had at the time. </p>
<p>It was just me sitting at a craft table selling my stuff on Etsy.com.</p>
<p>3 years ago I created the original dog collar fabric flower.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>People loved the flower but asked, ""What about the boys?"" So I developed a bow tie for dogs.</p>
<p>People liked it too.</p>

My name is Amy and I started Bow Wow Couture with the last $20 I had at the time. 
It was just me sitting at a craft table selling my stuff on Etsy.com.
3 years ago I created the original dog collar fabric flower.
 

 
People loved the flower but asked, ""What about the boys?"" So I developed a bow tie for dogs.
People liked it too.
They liked it so much that my partner Anne had to help me with my ""hobby"". 
 

 
 
Independent pet boutiques began to order wholesale.
They ordered a lot. I needed help.
We decided it was time to invest every cent we had and just go for it.
It was a big risk.
 

 
We found a great space to lease. That's me in front of our new home the day we picked up the keys.
I really don't like photos of myself; I can't believe I'm sharing this picture with you.
My mom died almost 4 years ago at 59. She always told me that I could do anything. 
I believed her.
So we hired two wonderful ladies to help with the sewing.
 
 

Erika is an incredible seamstress. I've learned a lot just from watching her work.
Crystal is the Bow Tie Queen. She takes great pride in her bow ties and loves her granddaughter.
With their help, and Anne's help and more hard work we decided to attend a trade show where we could show our work to pet stores.
 

We attended the HH Backer Christmas Trade show in Chicago.
It was a huge success. We gained more than 20 new wholesale accounts.
We were also able to add a third employee to help with shipping. 
The big risk paid off.
But we needed more business. And more help.
 
 

 
We created a Fall/Winter 2012 line with a catalog, bought a new display and headed off to the SuperZoo 2012 pet industry trade show.
We did even better. Added 27 more accounts at the show and another 13 in the weeks that followed.
We also hired another employee. There are six of us now! 
My friends, the Winko family, also help out at craft fairs and trade shows.
I think our small brand has the ability to grow into something bigger.
And that's why we need your help.
 
 

 
We've gained a very loyal following because of the quality of our products.
We want major retailers to see that products made in the US can be high in quality AND affordable.
We need to exhibit at a trade show where those retailers purchase products.
That trade show is called Global Pet Expo. It will take place only two hours south of us, in Orlando, Florida.

<h3><strong>Introducing the FlipSlip! The 2<sup>nd</sup> pair that EVERY woman needs.</strong></h3>
<p>FlipSlips are foldable designer flats on the go that can easily fit into a small purse or a pocket. We have reduced the shoe to the size of an iPhone and made it fold so that it doesn't get your purse dirty.</p>
<p><img alt=""FlipSlip"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1199.photobucket.com/albums/aa475/eflatto/Slide1-1.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""FlipSlip""/></p>
<p>The FlipSlip's Unique Patented Technology is the only shoe that folds sole-to-sole and has a reversible upper so it is compressible and hygienic.</p>
<p><img alt=""iPhone"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1199.photobucket.com/albums/aa475/eflatto/Slide1.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""iPhone""/></p>
<p>FlipSlips have a high quality neoprene upper that makes it waterproof, yet breathable for all occasions. The padded, foam cushion insole makes walking a comforting breeze. Flip Slip is TRULY an all-purpose shoe and you'ill love it!</p>
<h2>FLIPSLIP CROWD-DESIGN PROJECT ON INDIEGOGO</h2>
<p>We launched the Crowd-Design Project on Indiegogo to increase the designs in our foldable shoes collection and are doing so by actively involving artists from our creative community.</p>
<h3>So how does this work exactly? </h3>
<p>We called on designers from all over the U.S. to help us create the newest Flip Slips foldable shoes to put into production. They each had a couple of weeks to create the design and build a prototype and were given our pre-existing design to use as the base. In exchange, they received an opportunity to have fun sharing their talent with the world, receive full recognition for their work, learn about the process behind making shoes, as well as get a chance to be fairly compensated along the way; each artist will receive a percent of the profit from their designs.</p>
<p>We have the factory and all the molds, dyes and lasts needed to manufacture the shoes. All of our shoes are hand-made and we will source all the materials needed to make a high-quality replica of the original artwork. As an added bonus, by pre-ordering a pair of our designer shoes, you’ll also get to take part in the entire creative process and provide feedback on the final design, as well as receive photos and be kept posted on the progress of your shoes.</p>
<h3>Each pair that we pre-sale puts us one step closer to meeting our funding goal!</h3>
<p><img alt=""donate"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1199.photobucket.com/albums/aa475/eflatto/Slide11.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""donate""/></p>
<p>In order to truly make this project a success, we are giving our supportive communities the opportunity to decide which shoes get put into production by pre-ordering a replica from our designer collection.</p>
<p>A ""winning design"" is one that meets the factory minimum of 200 pairs. If we can exceed our campaign goals (with your help) we will make more designs as we meet the factory minimums so you'll have more designs to choose from.</p>
<p>* In case your design does not meet minimums, at the end of the campaign we will give you the option to choose from a winning design, get our classic shoes, or we will offer a refund.</p>
<p>The benefits of supporting this campaign.</p>
<p>For as low as $15, you can get the ultra compact Pocket-FlipSlips --- it has a soft foldable sole, and it’s great for emergency back-up use. You will also get an invitation to our San Francisco Launch Party in August and make a charitable donation to <a href=""http://www.kiva.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kiva.org</a>, a non-profit on a mission to alleviate poverty by empowering entrepreneurs through micro-loans.</p>
<p>You can also get our Classic Flip Slips in your choice of 32 different colors! You will have a chance to vote on the top 5 colors, and ALL of our shoes come with an expandable Flip-Tote bag to carry your other shoes in.</p>
<p>You can take part in our Community Design Project and support our fellow designers:</p>
<p>You can take a look at our Designer Gallery to see each one and learn more about each design and artist. Please Hurry! The first 200 purchases for each category will receive a 15% discount on their order.</p>
<p>We want to bring you a high-quality, handcrafted replica of the original artwork made by each artist. Our factory is ready to go and we already have all the molds and everything we need to get going. The only thing that we need to get going is money.</p>
<h3><strong>We are seeking partners to help us SPREAD the love even more!</strong></h3>
<p>Join Us.</p>
<p>We’re always on the lookout for passionate individuals and calling on artists to help with our project. If you want to join our team and work together to achieve our dreams, e-mail us at <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">info@flipslip.com</span></p>
<p>We hope you’ll love FlipSlips as much as we do. REMEMBER: There are two BIG ways you can support us, you can Like us on Facebook and <strong>[SPREAD] </strong>the word to all your friends about our project, or back us and receive a pair of our shoes!</p>

</h3>
<p>About Metallic Strappers:</p>
<p>Artist RaymondCho wanted to put the straps in a much more fashion forward way using thinner straps and placing them along the back and wrapping the ankle of the foot.  This metallic finish can come in gold or silver or copper or colors that utilize metallic material. Features a bit of a point for a more interesting and fashion-forward look. The backing that supports the strap can come up 1 inch - 2 inches as long as it sits just on the ankle or above it. This shoe can be worn with a cocktail dress after a party to show off straps or with any shorter bottom piece in any other occasion to best show off the full design of the shoe. </p>

<p>Sunkiss: Main focus of the design was color and print. The orange satin on both the toe and the heel give it a chic look with the help of the bow which makes it playful. The print has a hint of orange which ties the shoe together and makes it kind of uniformed. The medallion in the middle gives the shoe a little attitude and conservativeness at the same time.</p>

</div></div>","Introducing the FlipSlip! The 2nd pair that EVERY woman needs.
FlipSlips are foldable designer flats on the go that can easily fit into a small purse or a pocket. We have reduced the shoe to the size of an iPhone and made it fold so that it doesn't get your purse dirty.

The FlipSlip's Unique Patented Technology is the only shoe that folds sole-to-sole and has a reversible upper so it is compressible and hygienic.

FlipSlips have a high quality neoprene upper that makes it waterproof, yet breathable for all occasions. The padded, foam cushion insole makes walking a comforting breeze. Flip Slip is TRULY an all-purpose shoe and you'ill love it!
FLIPSLIP CROWD-DESIGN PROJECT ON INDIEGOGO
We launched the Crowd-Design Project on Indiegogo to increase the designs in our foldable shoes collection and are doing so by actively involving artists from our creative community.
So how does this work exactly? 
We called on designers from all over the U.S. to help us create the newest Flip Slips foldable shoes to put into production. They each had a couple of weeks to create the design and build a prototype and were given our pre-existing design to use as the base. In exchange, they received an opportunity to have fun sharing their talent with the world, receive full recognition for their work, learn about the process behind making shoes, as well as get a chance to be fairly compensated along the way; each artist will receive a percent of the profit from their designs.
We have the factory and all the molds, dyes and lasts needed to manufacture the shoes. All of our shoes are hand-made and we will source all the materials needed to make a high-quality replica of the original artwork. As an added bonus, by pre-ordering a pair of our designer shoes, you’ll also get to take part in the entire creative process and provide feedback on the final design, as well as receive photos and be kept posted on the progress of your shoes.
Each pair that we pre-sale puts us one step closer to meeting our funding goal!

In order to truly make this project a success, we are giving our supportive communities the opportunity to decide which shoes get put into production by pre-ordering a replica from our designer collection.
A ""winning design"" is one that meets the factory minimum of 200 pairs. If we can exceed our campaign goals (with your help) we will make more designs as we meet the factory minimums so you'll have more designs to choose from.
* In case your design does not meet minimums, at the end of the campaign we will give you the option to choose from a winning design, get our classic shoes, or we will offer a refund.
The benefits of supporting this campaign.
For as low as $15, you can get the ultra compact Pocket-FlipSlips --- it has a soft foldable sole, and it’s great for emergency back-up use. You will also get an invitation to our San Francisco Launch Party in August and make a charitable donation to Kiva.org, a non-profit on a mission to alleviate poverty by empowering entrepreneurs through micro-loans.
You can also get our Classic Flip Slips in your choice of 32 different colors! You will have a chance to vote on the top 5 colors, and ALL of our shoes come with an expandable Flip-Tote bag to carry your other shoes in.
You can take part in our Community Design Project and support our fellow designers:
You can take a look at our Designer Gallery to see each one and learn more about each design and artist. Please Hurry! The first 200 purchases for each category will receive a 15% discount on their order.
We want to bring you a high-quality, handcrafted replica of the original artwork made by each artist. Our factory is ready to go and we already have all the molds and everything we need to get going. The only thing that we need to get going is money.
We are seeking partners to help us SPREAD the love even more!
Join Us.
We’re always on the lookout for passionate individuals and calling on artists to help with our project. If you want to join our team and work together to achieve our dreams, e-mail us at info@flipslip.com
We hope you’ll love FlipSlips as much as we do. REMEMBER: There are two BIG ways you can support us, you can Like us on Facebook and [SPREAD] the word to all your friends about our project, or back us and receive a pair of our shoes!

About Metallic Strappers:
Artist RaymondCho wanted to put the straps in a much more fashion forward way using thinner straps and placing them along the back and wrapping the ankle of the foot.  This metallic finish can come in gold or silver or copper or colors that utilize metallic material. Features a bit of a point for a more interesting and fashion-forward look. The backing that supports the strap can come up 1 inch - 2 inches as long as it sits just on the ankle or above it. This shoe can be worn with a cocktail dress after a party to show off straps or with any shorter bottom piece in any other occasion to best show off the full design of the shoe.

Designer #8: ""Sunkiss"" by Lilian Lane
$56.00 - Early-Bird Price (Select Shoe Aficionado Collection)$64.00 - Regular Price (Select Shoe Aficionado Collection)

Sunkiss: Main focus of the design was color and print. The orange satin on both the toe and the heel give it a chic look with the help of the bow which makes it playful. The print has a hint of orange which ties the shoe together and makes it kind of uniformed. The medallion in the middle gives the shoe a little attitude and conservativeness at the same time.

<p>Hockey Sans Frontières (HSF) / Hockey Without Borders is a registered non-profit organization established to affect positive change in the lives of children and youth by using the values of hockey to promote health, development and peace. To maximize our impact; our approach focuses on sending coaches abroad, organizing grassroots initiatives, engaging in local clinics and sending equipment to underfunded hockey communities around the world. What we discovered is that the most effective and sustainable way to have an impact on these communities is to send coaches; young Canadians who could share their passion for the sport and impart their invaluable knowledge by teaching skating, coaching hockey, and coaching coaches. Since 2009 we have sent coaches to Subotica, Serbia and for the first time this year we will be sending coaches to Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. <em>But there are more communities that need our help.</em></p>
<p>We need to raise $20,000 to launch the Hockey Without Borders Global Initiative. In January 2013, Craig and Matt will visit ten thriving hockey communities. In each community, they will conduct clinics, host various hockey events, and most importantly develop the essential partnerships needed for us to send coaches in the future. Along for the journey will be a filmmaker to capture the powerful emotions that the sport inspires and the relationships that hockey can nurture. HSF recognizes that in order to establish these partnerships with hockey communities around the world, an essential first step is to visit them. The purpose is to develop a relationship with the program organizers and assess the needs of the community.</p>
<p>By donating to the Hockey Without Borders Global Initiative, HSF will be able to develop ten new partnerships and in turn new communities to send the most valuable resource, coaches.</p>

<p><em><strong> </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>MAXIMUM COMFORT AND SUPPORT ARE A MUST, FORUS SHOES COME WITH OUR PATENTED POLSTARMAX 6 INSOLES.</strong></em></p>
<p><img alt=""MAXIMUM COMFORT AND SUPPORT ARE A MUST, FORUS SHOES COME WITH OUR PATENTED POLSTARMAX 6 INSOLES."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/386748/files/20120813183147-red_nitro.jpg?1344907926"" src="""" style="""" title=""THE FORUS NYTRO 90X""/></p>
<p><strong>HOW DID WE COME UP WITH FORUS?</strong></p>
<p> It all started with this statement: - “ This sucks! My shoe insoles are completely worn out and I feel like I am walking and training on a board!! It hurts!! ” </p>
<p>After saying and thinking along these lines for over eight years we were fed up. We could not understand why better support meant spending an extra $30 for aftermarket insoles. We quickly learned that we were not alone to hope for a shoe with a standard shock absorbent system yet with incomparable comfort and engineering. </p>
<p> After speaking with a few podiatrists and learning that all insoles standard in shoes we purchased (even non-athletics ones) provided close to no support whatsoever, we decided to do something about it! And that’s where the journey began!</p>
<p> </p>

<p><em><strong>IN BLACK AND NEON GREEN...IT IS GETTING INTERESTING..</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong> </strong></em></p>
<p><strong>WHY THE NAME FORUS? WHAT’S WITH THE LOGO? </strong></p>
<p>Our philosophy is the inspiration behind the name FORUS. This brand is “for us” who want maximum support, comfort, and performance from our products, and “for us” who wish to make a difference in our communities. This alliance of community and business is symbolized in the logo: two hands interlock in a gesture of solidarity, people working together, and corporations supporting communities to create a better socially accountable business.</p>

<p><strong>WHY GIVE BACK? </strong></p>
<p> It was an evolving process to set up the base framework for <strong>FORUS </strong>philanthropic vision, simply because we wanted to find the right way to give back. We believe all corporations should be involved in the communities they serve. So <strong>FORUS</strong> forever plaged 10% of its global profits to children charities worldwide. We encourage you to watch the video in our gallery explaning <strong>FORUS philantropic Mission</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Thanks for supporting FORUS and let's CHALLENGE THE STATUS QUO!</strong></p></div>","Three years ago, a group of athletes sought to create running shoes with the most shock absorbent system for maximum support, and a comfortable precise fit. Why? Simply because we all deserve it!
 
MAXIMUM COMFORT AND SUPPORT ARE A MUST, FORUS SHOES COME WITH OUR PATENTED POLSTARMAX 6 INSOLES.

HOW DID WE COME UP WITH FORUS?
 It all started with this statement: - “ This sucks! My shoe insoles are completely worn out and I feel like I am walking and training on a board!! It hurts!! ” 
After saying and thinking along these lines for over eight years we were fed up. We could not understand why better support meant spending an extra $30 for aftermarket insoles. We quickly learned that we were not alone to hope for a shoe with a standard shock absorbent system yet with incomparable comfort and engineering. 
 After speaking with a few podiatrists and learning that all insoles standard in shoes we purchased (even non-athletics ones) provided close to no support whatsoever, we decided to do something about it! And that’s where the journey began!
 
THE NYTRO 90X IN LIGHT GRAY AND NEON GREEN. 11.5 OZ FOR A STABILITY SHOE IS JUST AMAZING,ADMIT IT...

 

IN BLACK AND NEON GREEN...IT IS GETTING INTERESTING..
 
WHY THE NAME FORUS? WHAT’S WITH THE LOGO? 
Our philosophy is the inspiration behind the name FORUS. This brand is “for us” who want maximum support, comfort, and performance from our products, and “for us” who wish to make a difference in our communities. This alliance of community and business is symbolized in the logo: two hands interlock in a gesture of solidarity, people working together, and corporations supporting communities to create a better socially accountable business.
AND FINALLY....FOR NOW, IN BLACK AND ORANGE. AND WITH YOUR BACKING WE WILL BE ABLE TO CREATE MANY MORE FUN COLOR COMBINATIONS.
 
SIZES WE CURRENTLY HAVE AVAILABLE. WITH YOUR BACKING WE WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE MORE.

WHY GIVE BACK? 
 It was an evolving process to set up the base framework for FORUS philanthropic vision, simply because we wanted to find the right way to give back. We believe all corporations should be involved in the communities they serve. So FORUS forever plaged 10% of its global profits to children charities worldwide. We encourage you to watch the video in our gallery explaning FORUS philantropic Mission.
IN FACT, 10% OF THE FUNDS RAISED HERE WILL GO TOWARDS FORUS PHILANTROPIC MISSION. SO JOIN US IN CHANGING LIVES.
“What if one step towards making our world a better place did not require us to donate, but simply make the choice of a brand? “ -- FORUS Athletics. 
 
 TREND-SETTING DESIGNS -- We pride ourselves in creating shoes that answer to the needs of our advocates. We won’t pretend to know what you need. All we do is talk to specialists to learn what problems need to be addressed and we work on them. And since we don’t hesitate to CHALLENGE THE STATUS QUO, we tend to go crazy with our aesthetics and engineering design! Did someone just say function and fashion?

<p>Every year, in Europe itself, <b>over 5,000 pedestrians</b> die in predominantly urban mobility and <b>over 2,000 are the cyclists deaths</b>. About 20% of accidents in Urban Mobility has Pedestrians as object, while the highest percentage of the causes of these fatalities and carelessness concerns premature actions, inattention or no action. We are talking in total, in Europe itself, of <b>more than 10,000 people who have injuries to carelessness in walks or for not argue actions</b> (not stopping at a stop sign, do not comply with the traffic code), which unfortunately will add more than 7,000 deaths. Everything for carelessness! Over 45% of pedestrian casualties were admitted to hospital. Darkness is also the condition associated with the most pedestrian fatalities, more than 51% of the total. <i>(2014, European DACOTA Project, European Commission, Directorakte-General for Mobility &amp; Transport).</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Private survey data are even more extreme, either related to pedestrians or cyclists. They reported that 92% of cyclists are not wearing a protective helmet, even though more than 85% of them understand that this carries a risk, but still 85% of them say they do not wear protection because in the headgear or helmets market there are not highly portable, comfortable and adequate head protectors. Next, as regards pedestrians, almost 100% of them do not wear head protection: 72% of them clearly understand risk includes, but always 100% of them tell they do not wear head protectors because these are too bulky, not stylistically well made, heavy, rigid, non-portable, not trendy .</p>
<p>If we introduce outdoor activities in our analysis then numbers increase exponentially, dramatic. (European Outdoor Group. (2014). Overview of the European outdoor market).</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">And that's why Rakki, and why we are working on head protectors: because <b> one third of those above injuries cause trauma or head injuries</b>. Rakki is a Protective Headgear but you can wear it like a simple wool beanie, it is soft, foldable, soft to the touch, but powerful and resistant to Low-Impacts, stylish and interactive.</span></p>
<p>Rakki is therefore extremely competitive, versatile and unique because on one side it prevents the damages caused by the most common accidents,  lowering the of risk of injury or wounds, while on the other side it opens the way to secure communication in modern urban mobility, all in softness and with the style you are looking for.</p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Today, very often there is a consumer refusal in choosing effective protection because these seldom are in line with the trends of style, with clothing and because they distort the image of the person - especially if customers are teen-end and in urban mobility gear or Outdoor sports goods and apparel. Almost all people well understand the need to wear a head protection during urban mobility, whatever it is. But all the same people do not wear it even though they clearly understand the risk, because they do not have a chance to choose something protective and at the same time be soft, not bulky, not troublesome, with an excellent design, style, portable: there are now only hard and stiff head protections!</span><br/></p>
<p>With Rakki we finally have the solution!</p>

<p>Poron® XRD® consists of air permeable open-cells that resist collecting moisture and perspiration on the surface of the skin. With each move, the material compresses and flexes, allow air and moisture to move freely.</p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FXT8jWm5MBPw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DXT8jWm5MBPw&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FXT8jWm5MBPw%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p>Due to its open cell structure, Poron® XRD® retains a “like-new” softness, flexibility and cushioning effect while resisting the tendency to bottom out and break down under multiple impacts. Therefore, PORON material returns to its original form and performance after each impact, as if you are using it for the first time – every time.</p>
<p>When you’re risking it all, you need protective gear you can count on. Poron® XRD® Technology is engineered to be soft and flexible – so you can move freely and in comfort, but is also durable and provides unbeatable, repeated impact protection that performs when you need it most. No other protective material can offer this combination of benefits!</p>
<p>When the soft foam is stressed at a high rate or impacted quickly, the foam material instantaneously reaches the point when the urethane momentarily ""freezes"" - like water freezing into ice. When this happens, the material becomes firm/rigid to form a protective shell that shields the head inside from impact energy. Poron® XRD® Technology absorbs more impact energy at higher speeds than anything else available in the market. In other words, it prevents head injuries than any other soft protector you can find anywhere in the world. </p>
<p>So, if subjected to both single or multiple impacts, Poron XRD reacts simply ""hardening and returning soft"", even several times, while the time it takes for this transformation is imperceptible, not obvious.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432726558/nbx16pjbmsoaprlvyrmj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>Poron XRD is, moreover, at least <b>40% better performant</b> than the best performing of its competitors, at least <b>70% more than the normal elastomers</b> used as shock absorption, Neoprene, EVA, orange materials, etc. </p>
<p></p>

<p>Furthermore, Poron XRD distinguishes itself in the field of shock-absorber because it is <b>completely breathable and antimicrobial</b>. These are very important factors for a product used in contact with the skin 24 hrs per day, every season, latitude, altitude and environmental condition, water, snow, mud. </p>

<p>We have also micropunched the layer of PoronXRD to help still greater breathability and also to allow the use in water sports, where we can predict a complete immersion of Rakki and where it is necessary a fast and complete emptying of the protective hat - for example further on a fall from a <b>Kiteboard or a Windsurf.</b> </p>

<p>Internally Rakki is covered with a durable water repellent and highly comfortable fabric, with a high performance against spontaneous sweating. In fact the yarns of <b>Silver</b> <b>help the dispersion of the vapor of perspiration towards the outside</b>, through the open cells structure and the microholes on the whole surface of Poron XRD.</p>

<p>Rakki also offers a series of functional and stylistic accessories that enriches the style of the project and will complete its technological value.</p>
<p>Rakki offers a number of <b>External Cap-Cover</b> that can be applied to the cap base through some simple clip buttons that allow you to change in a flash your style: from a urban beanie to a PA cover for water sports or a freeze repellent one in the cold and snow.

<br/><p><b>Refraction</b></p>
<p>Rakki also offers an important element of passive safety: the refraction. Rakki not only has reflective stripes on the back as trivially many hats or protective helmets offer, but everywhere, either strips that wrap and refract, front, side or rear, so that even a light projection of a headlight of a car coming from a side street, in the dark of winter nights, brightens your Rakki and communicates that you're there, preventing accidents and bringing you home safely.</p>

<p>My profession has taken me to travel and learn more about numerous metropolitan areas in the world, and I guarantee you that my attention is focused mainly on two factors:</p>

<p>We want to produce Rakki and spread it to all markets. We are confident that we can produce Rakki respecting scheduled timing. Normally design, prototyping and product development timing will take the risk and possibility of some stops due to some processes of development, that inevitably lead to a delay of the time of production and delivery. That's why we preferred to made all the development and pre-production at our risk and investment before submitting Rakki to everyone, so as to cancel every possible risks of delay due to the development, as above. We will manufacture, we will test the product and we will give you your Rakki respecting the maximum schedule.</p>
<p>All risks related to delays in the development as the risks related to delays in pre-series have already been taken and addressed. </p>
<p>Today we have a product fully tested in over hundreds copies and ready to be manufactured.</p>
<p>Some risks of delay in the delivering of future releases if achieveing the Stretched Goals may be regarded, as we have not directly tested the introduction of the electronic implementations, HD Camera, sensors and App development first, although now we have a long experience and we have  already analyzed it with suppliers.</p>
<p>In addition, a structured plan of management and costs of the development of production assures us that we will not be in the situation of a sudden raise in production costs.</p>

</div><p></p></div>","Rakki is the most innovative protective headgear, soft and interactive especially designed for urban mobility. Extremely portable and protective to the impacts, with a system of integrated telephone communication.





No more stiff and bulky helmets! Rakki  is soft, light - a little more than 100 gr / 4 oz. - and soft, because it is made of Poron® XRD® Extreme Impact Protection, an innovative soft impact resistant microcellular material. When the soft foam of Poron XRD is stressed at a high rate or is impacted quickly, the material becomes firm / rigid to form a protective shell that shields the head inside from impact energy. Poron XRD Technology absorbs more impact energy at higher speeds than anything else available on the market.











In other words, it prevents the injuries of heads than any other soft protector you can find anywhere in the world. When you wear Rakki you decide to protect your head during your travel and talk by an integrated phone module. Then, when it is not needed, you can fold it and put in your back  pocket or a bag, simple and compact, flexible.
Let your kids play, give you few minutes to watch some sequences of the backstage of the main video, that's Amazing!! 
Let your kids play using their fantasy, get them wearing RAKKI:

---------------






Rakki is a Soft and Foldable protective Cap made of Poron® XRD® Extreme Impact Protection, designed for all forms of urban displacement, both active and passive, playful, sporty, or even just for regular movements that are part of your daily life. But also it caters for all practices and games and sporting disciplines, amateur or professional, involving open-air activities, not only in urban but also suburban extensively.



Walking, running, cycling, travelling, but also enjoying skateboarding, parkour, longboard, Paintball, Airsoft, Xpogo, Free Running, Power Bocking, skating, the most diverse sports activities practiced on the landscape, in water as in the snow or on the lawn, with or without wheels or boards: Rakki is for all of us.







A small amazing revolution in the world of Urban Mobility.
Walking through town, as doing the daily underground running, the small displacement using your bike to take your child to school, 



such as moving to / from the workplace, alone or with other friends, these are all activities where the use of Rakki involves/gives  a considerable reduction of the possibility of injury or accident.
STATISTICS


Every year, in Europe itself, over 5,000 pedestrians die in predominantly urban mobility and over 2,000 are the cyclists deaths. About 20% of accidents in Urban Mobility has Pedestrians as object, while the highest percentage of the causes of these fatalities and carelessness concerns premature actions, inattention or no action. We are talking in total, in Europe itself, of more than 10,000 people who have injuries to carelessness in walks or for not argue actions (not stopping at a stop sign, do not comply with the traffic code), which unfortunately will add more than 7,000 deaths. Everything for carelessness! Over 45% of pedestrian casualties were admitted to hospital. Darkness is also the condition associated with the most pedestrian fatalities, more than 51% of the total. (2014, European DACOTA Project, European Commission, Directorakte-General for Mobility & Transport).
Private survey data are even more extreme, either related to pedestrians or cyclists. They reported that 92% of cyclists are not wearing a protective helmet, even though more than 85% of them understand that this carries a risk, but still 85% of them say they do not wear protection because in the headgear or helmets market there are not highly portable, comfortable and adequate head protectors. Next, as regards pedestrians, almost 100% of them do not wear head protection: 72% of them clearly understand risk includes, but always 100% of them tell they do not wear head protectors because these are too bulky, not stylistically well made, heavy, rigid, non-portable, not trendy .
If we introduce outdoor activities in our analysis then numbers increase exponentially, dramatic. (European Outdoor Group. (2014). Overview of the European outdoor market).

And that's why Rakki, and why we are working on head protectors: because  one third of those above injuries cause trauma or head injuries. Rakki is a Protective Headgear but you can wear it like a simple wool beanie, it is soft, foldable, soft to the touch, but powerful and resistant to Low-Impacts, stylish and interactive.
Rakki is therefore extremely competitive, versatile and unique because on one side it prevents the damages caused by the most common accidents,  lowering the of risk of injury or wounds, while on the other side it opens the way to secure communication in modern urban mobility, all in softness and with the style you are looking for.






-----------------

Let’s start with the name: Rakki.


Rakki is a Japanese urban slang term, I could not find it anywhere else! It comes from a corruption of English ""Lucky"" (lucky) and is used by young Japaneses to indicate a stroke of genius or a particularly positive mood. That was what I wanted: Rakki !!




PERKSHelp us with supporting RAKKI on this campaign, you will receive amazing perks!






Features
Rakki offers itself for a market sector of over 70% of conventional fatalities, mainly in urban areas.
With Rakki we aim to reduce the percentage of damage due to the more common accidents, introducing a protective factor that helps the protection, but at the same time does not restrict the portability and communication as well does not affect the style and design.


Today, very often there is a consumer refusal in choosing effective protection because these seldom are in line with the trends of style, with clothing and because they distort the image of the person - especially if customers are teen-end and in urban mobility gear or Outdoor sports goods and apparel. Almost all people well understand the need to wear a head protection during urban mobility, whatever it is. But all the same people do not wear it even though they clearly understand the risk, because they do not have a chance to choose something protective and at the same time be soft, not bulky, not troublesome, with an excellent design, style, portable: there are now only hard and stiff head protections!
With Rakki we finally have the solution!
 

Style, through different tissues linings as among many proposals for customizations and between several external style accessories, to easily “Create Your Rakki"", and always feel yourself taking the top trends at every opportunity, but safe, secure, innovative, creative and unique! Or even,  the latest trend, you can wear Rakki naked, N-Rakki: choose to let people see the “magic material"" hidden in your Rakki, colorful, tech, high-end, which is the maximum expression of the special microcellular material that makes Rakki.

Protection, through the use of Poron XRD, the basic material of Rakki. Poron XRD consists of air permeable open-cells that resist collecting moisture and perspiration on the surface of the skin. With each move, the material compresses and flexes, allow air and moisture to move freely. But when the soft foam of Poron XRD is stressed at a high rate or impacted quickly, the material becomes firm/rigid to form a protective shell that shields the head inside from impact energy. Poron XRD Technology absorbs more impact energy at higher speeds than anything else available in the market. In other words, it prevents the injuries of heads than any other soft protector you can find anywhere in the world.
Communication, through the introduction of a Bluetooth Module 

to make phone calls, communicate, make SOS calls, such as the introduction of an HD Camera and biometric sensors that through a special App monitors the status of your body at all times (release 2.0). Due to the thickness and density of the Poron XRD layer we can integrate in Rakki a whole range of electronic devices which are moreover bump protected just by the material itself.





Poron® XRD® 


Rakki is completely made of Poron® XRD® Extreme Impact Protection.
Poron® XRD® consists of air permeable open-cells that resist collecting moisture and perspiration on the surface of the skin. With each move, the material compresses and flexes, allow air and moisture to move freely.

Due to its open cell structure, Poron® XRD® retains a “like-new” softness, flexibility and cushioning effect while resisting the tendency to bottom out and break down under multiple impacts. Therefore, PORON material returns to its original form and performance after each impact, as if you are using it for the first time – every time.
When you’re risking it all, you need protective gear you can count on. Poron® XRD® Technology is engineered to be soft and flexible – so you can move freely and in comfort, but is also durable and provides unbeatable, repeated impact protection that performs when you need it most. No other protective material can offer this combination of benefits!
When the soft foam is stressed at a high rate or impacted quickly, the foam material instantaneously reaches the point when the urethane momentarily ""freezes"" - like water freezing into ice. When this happens, the material becomes firm/rigid to form a protective shell that shields the head inside from impact energy. Poron® XRD® Technology absorbs more impact energy at higher speeds than anything else available in the market. In other words, it prevents head injuries than any other soft protector you can find anywhere in the world. 
So, if subjected to both single or multiple impacts, Poron XRD reacts simply ""hardening and returning soft"", even several times, while the time it takes for this transformation is imperceptible, not obvious.



Poron XRD is, moreover, at least 40% better performant than the best performing of its competitors, at least 70% more than the normal elastomers used as shock absorption, Neoprene, EVA, orange materials, etc. 


Furthermore, Poron XRD distinguishes itself in the field of shock-absorber because it is completely breathable and antimicrobial. These are very important factors for a product used in contact with the skin 24 hrs per day, every season, latitude, altitude and environmental condition, water, snow, mud. 


We have also micropunched the layer of PoronXRD to help still greater breathability and also to allow the use in water sports, where we can predict a complete immersion of Rakki and where it is necessary a fast and complete emptying of the protective hat - for example further on a fall from a Kiteboard or a Windsurf. 




Internally Rakki is covered with a durable water repellent and highly comfortable fabric, with a high performance against spontaneous sweating. In fact the yarns of Silver help the dispersion of the vapor of perspiration towards the outside, through the open cells structure and the microholes on the whole surface of Poron XRD.




Over the basic inner liner with Silver yarn Rakki provides you with a special waterproof Ceramics soft fur that in the cold winter days helps retain heat around the head eliminating moisture of the steam produced.
Rakki also offers a series of functional and stylistic accessories that enriches the style of the project and will complete its technological value.
Rakki offers a number of External Cap-Cover that can be applied to the cap base through some simple clip buttons that allow you to change in a flash your style: from a urban beanie to a PA cover for water sports or a freeze repellent one in the cold and snow. With Rakki, just changing your cap-cover, you can always renew your style and to present yourself the best at every opportunity.



A clip placed onto the top of the various cover also allows you to choose to enrich your Rakki with POM-POMS, pins or other accessories. That’s Amazing!

Refraction
Rakki also offers an important element of passive safety: the refraction. Rakki not only has reflective stripes on the back as trivially many hats or protective helmets offer, but everywhere, either strips that wrap and refract, front, side or rear, so that even a light projection of a headlight of a car coming from a side street, in the dark of winter nights, brightens your Rakki and communicates that you're there, preventing accidents and bringing you home safely.

-----------------

My name is Bernardo. For many years I have dedicate myself to the design and development of protective products for the head, in every area, for each use and sport, from bike to motorbike, to extreme sports like Paintball as work DPI.





My profession has taken me to travel and learn more about numerous metropolitan areas in the world, and I guarantee you that my attention is focused mainly on two factors:
1- we move our bodies in the cities in which we live in, but without safety
2- head protection offered by the market do not pay attention to our needs
The above issues led me to some few simple considerations:
1- we need more safety and protection at all times of our urban journeys
2- we require a head protection not bulky and rigid, but foldable and storable and stylish 





Every day each of us spends an average of 120 minutes for the pure displacement from home to workplace and 152 minutes, on average, for the necessary movements in the city. To this data must be added statistically 112 minutes/person/day in the open air activities, games and sporting. We take approximately 384 minutes/day for commuting into the city: almost 6,5 hours of Urban Mobility, a very very high percentage.


I thought about how I could study a protective element but that also ‘do not distract the person who is wearing it’, due to the statistics that told that most of the injuries were due to inattention and distraction. And I thought I had to incorporate at least one phone in my new project, and so I did. 


In addition, I added the ability to send voice messages and listen to music until you get the chance to shoot video in HD and to monitor the values ​​of your body, to following releases.





I needed an impact resistant Head Gear, but also that would be soft, flexible, foldable and compact, lightweight. For all this I used an extraordinary material made available to me from a smart and capable company: I have found and tested the Poron XRD. Amazing! I had everything: I designed it, developed it, structured, tested: we are now ready to produce Rakki and offer them to everyone.




I asked for help from friends and colleagues who have helped me in the choice of possible manufacturing systems as surface treatments.




We have thus chosen special seams, resistant to salt water and UV rays, high-performance yarn in order you to wear Rakki at salt sea and in every possible condition. We defined different shapes and opted for the simplest solutions and usable ones, despite having investigated numerous options.



We also analysed the necessary surface drilling to help quick water escaping that may need in water sport after a water fall with N-Rakki, the correct diameter of holes, spacing, densities.
After a year of testings and prototyping we built the final version of Rakki that in my opinion is so cute and tech, respondent to every goal I had.

RISK AND CHALLENGES
We want to produce Rakki and spread it to all markets. We are confident that we can produce Rakki respecting scheduled timing. Normally design, prototyping and product development timing will take the risk and possibility of some stops due to some processes of development, that inevitably lead to a delay of the time of production and delivery. That's why we preferred to made all the development and pre-production at our risk and investment before submitting Rakki to everyone, so as to cancel every possible risks of delay due to the development, as above. We will manufacture, we will test the product and we will give you your Rakki respecting the maximum schedule.
All risks related to delays in the development as the risks related to delays in pre-series have already been taken and addressed. 
Today we have a product fully tested in over hundreds copies and ready to be manufactured.
Some risks of delay in the delivering of future releases if achieveing the Stretched Goals may be regarded, as we have not directly tested the introduction of the electronic implementations, HD Camera, sensors and App development first, although now we have a long experience and we have  already analyzed it with suppliers.
In addition, a structured plan of management and costs of the development of production assures us that we will not be in the situation of a sudden raise in production costs.",42.0,3,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","Living in a culture where shoes are taken off before entering any residence, numerous restaurants that require sitting on the ground, and sometimes even the office place, taking off and putting on your shoes can become cumbersome and annoying. Especially when your shoes are high-tops or if the laces are especially long. 

Plus, we all know the annoyances and risks
of having loose or extra long laces that can be tripped on or caught in
escalators, doors, etc. Some alternatives are to tie the knot on the inside of
the tongue, or double knot the shoes to prevent unraveling, but these can still
get looks as you yank your foot out or are annoying to undo and retie every
time you take off your shoes. So, are you a slave to your double knots too?







To solve these issues, we came up with
various different ways to prevent lace unraveling or dealing with long laces,
but we weren’t satisfied with their functionality or design. 


In the end, we raised the question, how can
we connect both sides of the laces and prevent unraveling without using tips.
And thus, we came up with TIPPIN.TIPPIN comes from the idea of removing those annoying TIPs and
connecting both sides of your laces using PINs. TIP + PIN = TIPPIN





In the end, we were able to take these two
ideas and come up with a design that would be a great solution to these
everyday problems.








TIPPIN’s magnets are strong
and allow easy one-touch use for all your laced shoes.Special techniques were applied in creating TIPPIN for
a more complete and stronger product using neodymium magnets.As easy as it is to take off your shoe by stepping on
the hell of the other, it’s just as easy to put them back on with a snap. To create the perfect shape with the perfect
functionality, foot bends, curves, and contours from several sample groups were
taken to come up with the perfect size and shape for TIPPIN.

TIPPIN was designed with the idea that “Simple is Best” and is easily customizable for each user’s individual needs in a variety of fashions.Just for our Indiegogo backers, we have designed
special custom packaging labels.TIPPIN is secure enough to keep your shoes on while
running, but easy to take off with little effort. The built-in magnets along
with TIPPIN’s design was created to be strong enough for any physical activity,
but easy enough to take off and put on.












TIPPIN comes in a variety of colors that
can match any color or style and comes in either a 4-hole or 6-hole design.

it can lead to significant physical and emotional changes.</span><br/></p>
<p>Low testosterone in males can lead to
reduced sex drive and sperm production, but those aren’t the only physical
symptoms. Testosterone also lowers your body’s ability to regulate fat and
hampers the build up of muscle mass and bone density.  </p>
<p>Emotionally, low testosterone can affect
your confidence and general sense of well-being. This can lead to depression,
lowered motivation and insomnia.   </p>
<p>Testicular function is hindered with even a
1℃ increase in temperature. Lashevan maintain your scrotum temperature at
approximately 33.5℃, which is a little lower than your average
body temperature and the ideal temperature for testosterone maintenance.</p>

<p>The silicon band is also intertwined with patented Deotech threads from
Japan. This deodorizing textile helps your skin maintain a balanced pH, thereby
combating odors that occur when your skin becomes to alkaline or acidic.
Deotech doesn’t mask odor chemically, and therefore combats stench while
leaving in pleasant laundry scents. Deotech also does not lose its deodorizing

Applying a 3-dimensional pattern that is perfectly structured around the
curves of the male private, Lashevan keeps things extremely fresh and pleasant
in the area you need it most.





Say goodbye to sweatiness and embarrassing pants adjustments with
Lashevan and find out why separate is better. 




The secret to Lashevan’s separation is a silicon band, which keeps the 3D structural design of the underwear intact. On your front, this allows Lashevan to gently keep your penis, scrotum and thighs from rubbing against one another. On your rear as well, the band maintains the underwear’s structure, preventing clinging on your buttox. This structural distortion technology resists creasing and unwanted stretching while conforming to your body. 



















Stuffiness and sweatiness in your crotch region is not just uncomfortable,
it can lead to significant physical and emotional changes.
Low testosterone in males can lead to
reduced sex drive and sperm production, but those aren’t the only physical
symptoms. Testosterone also lowers your body’s ability to regulate fat and
hampers the build up of muscle mass and bone density.  
Emotionally, low testosterone can affect
your confidence and general sense of well-being. This can lead to depression,
lowered motivation and insomnia.   
Testicular function is hindered with even a
1℃ increase in temperature. Lashevan maintain your scrotum temperature at
approximately 33.5℃, which is a little lower than your average
body temperature and the ideal temperature for testosterone maintenance.
Through an infrared thermographic camera
test, we found that Lashevan’s significant cooling effect lowers scrotum
temperature by 2 to 3℃ lower than other underwear 










Lashevan’s fabric is intricately cross-stitched together using Tencel
fibres derived from natural eucalyptus leaves. This 100% natural material has
natural cooling properties and is highly breathable thereby preventing
bacterial growth. This material is also highly flexible allowing it to contour
to your body’s movements no matter how physical the activity. 





The silicon band is also intertwined with patented Deotech threads from
Japan. This deodorizing textile helps your skin maintain a balanced pH, thereby
combating odors that occur when your skin becomes to alkaline or acidic.
Deotech doesn’t mask odor chemically, and therefore combats stench while
leaving in pleasant laundry scents. Deotech also does not lose its deodorizing
properties despite repeated washes.

















Currently, four designs being offered. Additional designs will be made available as a stretch goal.

<h3>The Intro</h3>
<p>'ARE YOU WHEEL?' is an ambitious project that aims to transform the multi-purpose and sustainable kitchen device R2B2 into a market ready product whilst involving your skills and ideas in the design process. Our dream is to make kitchen and household devices more sustainable, more environmentally-friendly and more independent from costly energy sources giving us a greener, less cluttered world.<br/><br/></p>
<h3>The Story</h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">












 Every task in the kitchen has its own associated appliance - grinding coffee, chopping herbs, mixing drinks - which means that as products break down, give up or simply go out of fashion then our electronic waste mountain grows ever higher.<br/><br/>With a desire to counteract this trend, Christoph Thetard concentrated on the design and production of sustainable appliances for his final year project at the Bauhaus University in Weimar, Germany. His mission was not to make electronic devices more 'environmentally friendly' but to eradicate the electronic element entirely.<br/> <br/>R2B2 stands for a new generation of multifunctional, sustainable kitchen devices. Containing kitchen utensils, a coffee grinder and a hand blender the machine is built from easy to maintain, hard-wearing materials. It is highly functional yet due to its simple construction it can easily be dismantled, cleaned and serviced. The machine's aesthetic is simple, natural and timeless. Most importantly it couldn't be easier to use; chopping herbs, grating cheese or mixing cocktails can all be accomplished with a just a few pedal kicks.<br/> <br/>The heart of the machine is a manually-powered flywheel which not only drives the appliances but also acts as an energy storage device.  <br/> <br/>The coffee grinder functions as both a mill and storage for the beans. It features a porcelain mill and two glass containers; a 300g-capacity storage unit for the beans and storage for the ground coffee.  </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><br/>The mixer is a multi-functional item and aims to do as many jobs as possible using the least number of parts. The interchangeable utensils include knife blades, a whisk and different adapters for slicing, blending and chopping. <br/><br/>The hand blender has a number of interchangeable heads ranging from a cappuccino creamer to an egg beater, an ice-crusher to a vegetable mixer.  <br/> <br/>'ARE YOU WHEEL?' is a both a marketing tool and a forum. We want to develop a ready-to-market machine with standard attachments included whilst at the same time opening up the process to the public, encouraging them to join us with their own ideas and suggestions.

</h3>
<span style=""font-style: italic;"">$$Bling!Bling!Bling!Bling!Bling!Bling!$$</span><br/><br/>R2B2 is at the moment a fully functional first prototype that needs to be to developed further to be a ready to market product. The development will concentrate on the driving unit and the attachments. Therefore we need highly specialized knowledge in engineering and machine-building. We already negotiated with some partners who are abled and willing to develop both including all necessary certificates. We also got a very ""supportive"" proposal way down below the marketprize but it is still a lot of money for us. Let us show you what we are talking about:<br/><br/><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Driving Unit</span><br/><ul>

We calculated that our investments during the next 10 month will be around <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">100.000$</span> (min.). Even so we are dreamers we are not totally naiv and know that that this is not a sum we are talking about here. We will put all our energy and money in the project and want to concentrate on a perfect product first. We want to start but we need your help to do so. We think with around <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">35.000$</span> support we would be abled to to give a final go for  further developments and it would also be a sign that there are enough people out there who believe in us, our product and our general approach! <br/><br/>Let us start together, now!<br/><br/><br style=""font-weight: bold;""/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">UPDATE 14.9. 2011    <br/><br/>There are some questions about what happens with the money if we <span style=""font-style: italic;"">don't </span>reach our goal:<br/><br/>We will put ALL the money into further developments and use the remaining time searching for other possibilities to get funded. We are doing this anyways because as mentioned above even 35.000$ is just about the half the money we need. Our technical partner offered us the opportunity to develope our product further step by step in case we can't provide all the money at ones.  So every dollar counts :)!<br/><br/><br/>Remaining questions? --&gt; hello@areyouwheel.com<br/><br/><br/><br/>       </span>                    <br/><h3> What You Get</h3>We have a problem! As we mentioned above it will take a longer period and a lot of money to develop R2B2. As for now we can not tell any exactly date of relase neither how much R2B2 will finally cost. That's why we decided we wanna be honest and not make you believe that if you support us now you will get R2B2 as a Reward delivered next week. That's is just not possible at the moment. BUT we are young and we are free and we have a lot of other really nice stuff you will get and which also will integrate you more into our project.<br/><br/>First of all we launch our own <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">""Wall of Fame""</span> on our site dedicated to all our supporters. We also designed some nice <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Cards and Posters</span> and every piece will be produced with our own hands. Some of our rewards get contributed by some other young german designers who are supporting our project: <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">""The Gehsammler &amp; The PUPAS""</span> (see pictures below). Furthermore we will give some of you access to our <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">""Inner Circle""</span> to participate in future developments. We will also host ""<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Workshop"" </span>in Germany and therefore were able to get some interesting speaker. If you are really crazy about us we will fly you in to our <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">R2B2 Releaseparty</span> in (hopefully) 2012. <br/><br/><br/>Additional everybody will get some future discount on our product depending on the total amount spend. The more mony you spend the more discount you will get, on both the machine as well as the attachments. How much the discount will be we will tell you as soon as we know our exactly costs.

Total Investment for Product Development:                   61.080$Duration: 7-8 monthsThis is bunch of Gold and there are no costs whatsoever included for Legals, Office, Stamps, Petfood or what else we will need to set up all structures for our market entry. We calculated that our investments during the next 10 month will be around 100.000$ (min.). Even so we are dreamers we are not totally naiv and know that that this is not a sum we are talking about here. We will put all our energy and money in the project and want to concentrate on a perfect product first. We want to start but we need your help to do so. We think with around 35.000$ support we would be abled to to give a final go for  further developments and it would also be a sign that there are enough people out there who believe in us, our product and our general approach! Let us start together, now!UPDATE 14.9. 2011    There are some questions about what happens with the money if we don't reach our goal:We will put ALL the money into further developments and use the remaining time searching for other possibilities to get funded. We are doing this anyways because as mentioned above even 35.000$ is just about the half the money we need. Our technical partner offered us the opportunity to develope our product further step by step in case we can't provide all the money at ones.  So every dollar counts :)!Remaining questions? --> hello@areyouwheel.com                            What You GetWe have a problem! As we mentioned above it will take a longer period and a lot of money to develop R2B2. As for now we can not tell any exactly date of relase neither how much R2B2 will finally cost. That's why we decided we wanna be honest and not make you believe that if you support us now you will get R2B2 as a Reward delivered next week. That's is just not possible at the moment. BUT we are young and we are free and we have a lot of other really nice stuff you will get and which also will integrate you more into our project.First of all we launch our own ""Wall of Fame"" on our site dedicated to all our supporters. We also designed some nice Cards and Posters and every piece will be produced with our own hands. Some of our rewards get contributed by some other young german designers who are supporting our project: ""The Gehsammler & The PUPAS"" (see pictures below). Furthermore we will give some of you access to our ""Inner Circle"" to participate in future developments. We will also host ""The Workshop"" in Germany and therefore were able to get some interesting speaker. If you are really crazy about us we will fly you in to our R2B2 Releaseparty in (hopefully) 2012. Additional everybody will get some future discount on our product depending on the total amount spend. The more mony you spend the more discount you will get, on both the machine as well as the attachments. How much the discount will be we will tell you as soon as we know our exactly costs. We promise! The Gehsammler and The PUPAS
P.S. We will upload addtional information about our rewards on our blog the next days!

<br/>Common Problems Solved</h3>
<p>Getting your baby warm, dry and fully bundled after each bath may sound easy but all parents know – it's more like mission impossible.  We worry that we'll drop our slippery baby as we fumble with the towel.  We fret that they'll catch a cold because one side of the towel is too short to cover them.  No matter what, it's a feat not to get drenched!</p>
<p></p>
<p>3 innovative details come together in our towel design to resolve some of the most common problems and concerns that other apron- and baby-towels face today: </p>
<p></p>

<p>       ✗   Velcro straps can catch on hair or ruin clothes in the dryer</p>

<h4>KEY DESIGN POINT TWO: Hood on the Side </h4>
<p>The side placed hood design allows moms to <b>cradle the baby in a natural position </b>while allowing you to hold the baby, snap off the apron buckle and bundle the baby all with the other free hand. The side placement also <b>accommodates the growth of the baby for a longer time</b> as it allows for the full diagonal length of the towel (45 inches) to be used without it being curtailed by the neck straps. </p>

<h4>KEY DESIGN POINT THREE: Absorbent 100% Pure Cotton</h4>

<h4>KEY POINT #1</h4>
<p></p>
<p>Our first challenge was to discover the easiest way to put the apron towel on, and then take it off after the bath, without having to fumble. We immediately nixed Velcro, knowing that it feels very rough on the baby's soft skin and even rougher on mom's hair and other fabrics in the dryer.</p>
<p></p>
<p>First we tried a button design, but it was clumsy and hard to take off with one hand...                                  </p>

<p>For the fabric material, we selected a luxurious, 100% cotton terry velour fabric that was plush and soft without forgoing on the absorbency and drying rate.  We thought about regular old terry cotton but we thought it was too thin and not comfy enough, and thick cotton velour on its own took a long time to dry. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<h4>KEY POINT #3</h4>Where to place the hood was a big decision for us.  We realized that if we kept the hood vertical to the apron buckle side, it would limit the length of the baby that this towel can bundle.  It also makes it harder to get the baby into a cradling position.  <p>Placement on the side corner resolved these issues.  </p>

<p>Beginning of 2015 two Italian Swiss gentlemen questioned the belief that luxury should be inherited or gained over time. They then decided to develop luxury products for young people and this is how Todd &amp; Marlon was born. Todd &amp; Marlon leverage old craftsmanship to create modern pieces of art; being Italians they appreciate beauty and have an innate sense of style and their Swiss heritage injects precision and attention to details in all their works. The products they develop are custom made to suit the needs of the people who create their own future - the entrepreneurs!  </p>

<p><b>What are the dimensions of the watch? </b><b>#YOURTIME </b>watch has a 38mm case diameter and it is 10 mm thick (without glass) – the bracelet is 144 mm long and the case 46mm for a total circumference of 190mm - however we are adding two extra links in the box to reach a total of 210mm.</p>
<p><b>I have a big wrist.</b> <b>How do I know the watch fits me? </b>The easiest way to figure that out would be to measure your wrist circumference.

</div></div>","Todd & Marlon is a luxury watch brand
established in New York in 2015. The company ultimate mission is to accompany
people with an Entrepreneurial Spirit in their daily journey so to make it
easier and more enjoyable. 
Their watch collection named #YOURTIME, in fact,
has been inspired by the entrepreneurial spirits to sustain entrepreneurs. In this
context Todd & Marlon work very closely with the non-profit organization
Spark Microgrants to enable entrepreneurs in rural areas.


Todd & Marlon watches are designed by Italians and crafted by Swiss people. The first collection includes two models both Swiss Made: a traditional 12-hour watch with an Automatic movement and more peculiar 24-hour watch with a quartz movement.
#YOURTIME watch collection won the 2016 A’ Design Award by the grand jury panel which consists of internationally influential press members, established designers, leading academics and prominent entrepreneurs. 

The TWO collections are available in four colors combinations: all black, black and deep blue, black and fiery red, black and rose pink. Each of them has his own name and specific character! You can either choose one of them or get the four to use in different occasions in your life. We have recently decided to expand the collection with the more traditional 12-hour Automatic watch which will be available in the very same 4 color combinations. Here below the all black version (hands placeholders only). More images will be shared once new prototypes are ready.Todd & Marlon have selected a Swiss Made movement because of the quality and Quartz for its reliability and accuracy. The 12-hour watch is also based on a Swiss Made movement. This is, in particular, an automatic (self-winding) movement with 26 jewels and date function on top of hours, minutes and seconds. The very same movement is used by some models by: Maurice Lacroix, TAG Heuer , Christopher Ward, Bulgari, Oris and Alpina.#YOURTIME is made of stainless steel (316L grade), it has a Diamond Like Carbon (DLC) coating treatment for achieving a super resistant black matte finish, it showcases the most resistant crystal made of Sapphire and just to make sure every moment is viable the watch is also resistant to water (10atm/100m).The 38mm case has a sophisticated and elegant silhouette yet it is boldly shaped to resist extreme activities. The custom made bracelet subtly reminds the brand logo which is also visible on: dial, crown, back case and buckle.The 24-hour variant of #YOURTIME shows two times 12 hours within the dial (double-XII system). The anti-meridian (am) hours are on the left hand side and the post-meridian (pm) hours are on the right hand side. The zenith for the sun is reached at 12:00 and is at the top of the dial as indicated by the applied silver sun icon.The 12-hour Automatic dial is built on two levels with circular brushing – silver half-hour marks are applied and numbers are double printed.



The hands in both models have a red insert with SuperLuminova - one of the best material (if not the best) to give luminescence at night.


In order to keep the first collection memorable we are planning to number the first 300 watches in the case back.Watches produced after the first 300 will not be numbered.


Details matter! we have carefully hidden the connections between the links in the bracelet. Few links toward the closure have still visible connections and those are screws (not simple pins) to ensure best performances and to allow adjustment of the bracelet length.


Todd & Marlon and Spark MicroGrants non-profit organization focused on enabling community-driven entrepreneurial projects, proudly announced a collaboration aimed at helping entrepreneurs where they need the most.    Todd & Marlon will donate a percentage of the profit to Spark MicroGrant. The more watches we sell the more entrepreneurs we will help!!!

Shipping is complimentary – entirely offered by Todd & Marlon for any destination served by our logistic partner. However, international customers are responsible for taxes and duties charged by their respective countries. 
You might visit http://www.dutycalculator.com/new-import-duty-and-tax-calculation/ to estimate your duty charges (we ship from US).
NY State Customers: please add 8.875% to your pledge account for NY State Sales Taxes.




The below schedule is as much realistic as possible. Manufacturers confirmed the schedule is realistic and contains slack to cover the normal, inevitable small delays. If Todd & Marlon can do it quicker, they will! In case something unforeseen that influences the schedule happens they will communicate openly about it.


Important to note that the production has already started (boxes are already produced). 




Beginning of 2015 two Italian Swiss gentlemen questioned the belief that luxury should be inherited or gained over time. They then decided to develop luxury products for young people and this is how Todd & Marlon was born. Todd & Marlon leverage old craftsmanship to create modern pieces of art; being Italians they appreciate beauty and have an innate sense of style and their Swiss heritage injects precision and attention to details in all their works. The products they develop are custom made to suit the needs of the people who create their own future - the entrepreneurs!  
Todd & Marlon - You Choose, #YOURTIME, Don't Inherit

The Award
We are pleased to announce that #YOURTIME Luxury Timepiece have been awarded the Silver A' Design Award in the category of Jewelry, Eyewear and Watch Design by the grand jury panel of the A’ Design Award & Competition which consists of internationally influential press members, established designers, leading academics and prominent entrepreneurs. 
The A' Design Awards are the world’s most influential and largest design awards, presented each year in Italy. It is a great honour for us to receive this prestigious award and we would like to thank all of our friends and partners for their support and help along the way. 
This award gives recognition to the excellence of design on the international stage. 




What are the dimensions of the watch? #YOURTIME watch has a 38mm case diameter and it is 10 mm thick (without glass) – the bracelet is 144 mm long and the case 46mm for a total circumference of 190mm - however we are adding two extra links in the box to reach a total of 210mm.
I have a big wrist. How do I know the watch fits me? The easiest way to figure that out would be to measure your wrist circumference. The watch can fit wrists up to 190mm with the basic configuration. However, if your wrist is bigger we have added two extra links that can get the total circumference to about 210mm and if you need more you can write to info@toddandmarlon.com. Conversely if your wrist is smaller you can easily remove some links at the nearest watch store. 
Does the black color come off? The watch is DLC (diamond like carbon) coated – this is the best and most durable treatment used only by real luxury watch manufacturers. For reference this treatment is superior to the most commonly used standard PVD (Physical Vapor Deposition) treatment. 
Are shipment and duty/taxes included? Your watch-pledge includes shipment anywhere in the world locations served by our logistic partner but it does NOT include your local import duties and taxes if you live outside the US. Unfortunately due to the complexity of the different duty/tax regimes across the world we cannot manage that cost. 
 More questions? If you have more question, you can always ask the project creator directly or feel free to e-mail to info@toddandmarlon.com.

Risks and challenges


With any project, there are always risks associated with manufacturers not being able to deliver products on time, or design decisions causing the project to be delayed or halted all together.
Todd & Marlon have minimized these risks by funding prototype production hence ensure that all design elements are finalized and manufacturers are ready to craft your timepiece. Please note that while design has been finalized, the supply of watch hands is not yet secured hence we might see slightly different hands in the final execution.
They have also instructed the manufacturers to start production (you might have noticed the images of boxes production) and take the funding risk from their side so to minimize the time risk on your side. This also means that watches will be manufactured even if the campaign is not successful.
Finally, Todd & Marlon work with a professional fulfillment company for deliveries. However, local customs can hamper a good delivery experience, which is out of our control. They will try to prevent custom problems via ensuring the packages have the right documentation in place.",47.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p></p>
<p><i><b>The Idea</b></i><br/></p>
<p>""Frollein Tongtong"" ist ein Berliner Projekt, das 
sich vor geraumer Zeit aus einer kleinen Idee heraus entwickelt hat. Ich
 bekam gerade unser zweites Baby, und war auf der Suche nach bequemer 
Babykleidung, möglichst auf ökologischer Basis, die nicht einschneidet 
wenn man das Baby im Tragetuch oder in der Tragehilfe transportiert. 
Ausserdem sollte sie länger tragbar sein, und viel Platz zum Strampeln 
lassen.</p>
<p><b><i>""Frollein Tongtong"" is a Berlin Project that was born out of an idea. I just gave birth to our second Baby, and i was searching for comfortable Baby Fashion, preferebly on ecologically Base, that had to fit perfectly when you carry the baby in a babysling. Besides it should be wearable, and give place to move inside.</i></b><br/></p>
<p>Ich wollte das ganze mit dem Thema Upcycling verbinden. Upcycling bedeutet, dass zum Großteil getragene und nicht mehr benötigte Stoffe zum Einsatz kommen, diese werden zu anderen Kleidungsstücken verarbeitet, und dürfen somit noch einen zweiten Frühling erleben. Man kann Kleidung nicht neu erfinden, aber man kann sie 
verändern. Ich wollte Babyklamotten schaffen die mitwachsen, und günstig
 sind. Daraus entwickelten sich die Mitwachshosen: sie sind aufgrund 
ihrer Bündchen über mindestens drei Kleidergrößen tragbar, und optisch 
noch dazu ein absoluter Knaller. Darüber hinaus fertige ich Röcke an, 
Tücher, kleine Taschen, und andere Bekleidungsstück für 
Mini-Erdenbürger.</p>
<p><b><i>I wanted to connect it all with Upcycling, which means that a large part of the material you´re using is already used. These 2nd Hand Textiles get used to be born into new Baby or Children´s Clothing. You can´t invent Pants again, but you can change them. I wantetd to create Babyclothing which grows with every Babymonth, and also is payable. On the basis of the welts i createt the expandable Pants: the welts are foldable, so these pants are wearable for a long time, most of them more than 3 dress sizes.</i></b><br/></p>
<p>Ich möchte mich hauptberuflich mit der Idee befassen, Baby- und Kinderkleidung zu schaffen die</p>
<ul>
<li>bequem für das Baby ist</li>
<li>dem Geldbeutel nicht weh tut</li>
<li>die Resourcen spart</li>

<h4>Was wir brauchen </h4>
<p><b>What we need</b><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Um dieses Projekt zu verwirklichen benötige ich Startkapital, das ich aus meinen eigenen Mittel momentan nicht erbringen kann.</p>
<p>Arbeitsmaterialien, zum Beispiel in Form einer Overlockmaschine. Diese Maschine sorgt dafür dass die Kleidung qualitativ hochwertig verarbeitet ist, die Nähte ordentlich verschlossen sind und sich nicht auftrennen. Zur Zeit arbeite ich mit einer 30 Jahre alten Gritzner 535 Nähmaschine, die über diese Funktion in leicht veränderter, aber nicht in formvollendeter Version verfügt.<br/></p>
<p> Des weiteren benötige ich unter anderem Bündchenstoffe:                                         diese umklappbaren Bündchen verleihen den einzelnen Teilen ihre lange Tragbarkeit über mehrere Kleidergrößen, und ersparen den Mamis einen monatlichen Neukauf.<br/></p>
<p>Ich möchte dieses Projekt zu einem Kleinunternehmen aufbauen das sich 
voller Stolz präsentieren kann. Hierfür benötige ich eine Website, die 
einen kleine Onlineshop beherbergt.<br/></p>
<p><b><i>We will need start-up capital to realize this Project, which i can´t adduce out of my own resources.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Working Material, for example in Form of a Overlockmachine. This Machine makes a high-quality Seam. It locks the Seam and makes sure that the Stitches don´t open anymore. I´m working with a 30 Years olf Gritzner 535, which doesn´t have this Function in the way i would need it.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>I also need welt textiles: these foldable welts lend these uniques their durable existence through differend dress sizes, which save Mothers from a monthly purchase.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>I want to build this Project into a small business, so it can present itself with full pride. For that i´ll need a Website which includes a small Onlineshop.</i></b><br/></p>
<h4>Die Auswirkung</h4>
<p><b><i>The Effect</i></b><br/></p>
<p>Ich bin Tag und Nacht mit Leidenschaft bei ""Frollein Tongtong"" am Werk, und überlege ständig was zu verbessern ist, wo es noch hakt, suche Lösungen und versuche sie umzusetzen. Finanziell bin ich nun an meine Grenzen gestoßen, und kann mich allein nicht erweitern. Ich möchte ""Frollein Tongtong"" zu einem kleinen Label machen, das gern gekauft und getragen wird, und wieder ein bisschen Vertrauen in den Slogan  ""Made in Germany"" gewinnen lässt. </p>
<p><b><i>I´m Night and Day with all my Heart and Passion on ""Frollein Tongtong"", and always think about what to improve, i search for Solutions and try to implement them. I´m at my financial limits now, i can´t expand on my own. I want ""Frollein Tongtong"" transform into a Label which People love to by and Baby´s love to wear, and bring back the Trust into ""Made in Germany"".</i></b><br/></p>
<h4>Andere Wege, wie man helfen kann</h4>
<b>Other Ways to help</b><br/><br/>Ich freue mich natürlich auch sehr über Sachspenden :). <br/>Aber falls gerade niemand eine Overlockmaschine zu Verschenken hat, tut es auch das Verlinken meiner Kampagne. Ich danke jedem einzelnen von Euch für das Lesen, und überlegen ob und wie er das Projekt unterstützen kann.<br/><br/><b><i>I´m always happy about all kind of donations :).<br/>But if no one having a Overlockmachine to giveaway, you also help me with sharing the Link to my Campaign. I´m thanking every single one of you for reading, and thinking about if and how he/she can support this Project! </i></b><br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","""Frollein Tongtong"" ist Synonym für einen in Berlin weit verbreiteten Titel des ""frechen Mädchens von Nebenan"".

Ich wollte das ganze mit dem Thema Upcycling verbinden. Upcycling bedeutet, dass zum Großteil getragene und nicht mehr benötigte Stoffe zum Einsatz kommen, diese werden zu anderen Kleidungsstücken verarbeitet, und dürfen somit noch einen zweiten Frühling erleben. Man kann Kleidung nicht neu erfinden, aber man kann sie 
verändern. Ich wollte Babyklamotten schaffen die mitwachsen, und günstig
 sind. Daraus entwickelten sich die Mitwachshosen: sie sind aufgrund 
ihrer Bündchen über mindestens drei Kleidergrößen tragbar, und optisch 
noch dazu ein absoluter Knaller. Darüber hinaus fertige ich Röcke an, 
Tücher, kleine Taschen, und andere Bekleidungsstück für 
Mini-Erdenbürger.
I wanted to connect it all with Upcycling, which means that a large part of the material you´re using is already used. These 2nd Hand Textiles get used to be born into new Baby or Children´s Clothing. You can´t invent Pants again, but you can change them. I wantetd to create Babyclothing which grows with every Babymonth, and also is payable. On the basis of the welts i createt the expandable Pants: the welts are foldable, so these pants are wearable for a long time, most of them more than 3 dress sizes.
Ich möchte mich hauptberuflich mit der Idee befassen, Baby- und Kinderkleidung zu schaffen die

bequem für das Baby ist
dem Geldbeutel nicht weh tut
die Resourcen spart
die der Umwelt nicht schmerzt.
Für dieses Projekt benötige ich Hilfe in Form von Spenden.I wanna deal full time with the idea of creating Baby and Children´s Clothing which is
comfortable for the Baby
doesn´t hurt Mom´s Wallet
save Resources
doesn´t injure the Environment

For this Project I´ll need Help in Form of Donations.














Was wir brauchen 
What we need


Um dieses Projekt zu verwirklichen benötige ich Startkapital, das ich aus meinen eigenen Mittel momentan nicht erbringen kann.
Arbeitsmaterialien, zum Beispiel in Form einer Overlockmaschine. Diese Maschine sorgt dafür dass die Kleidung qualitativ hochwertig verarbeitet ist, die Nähte ordentlich verschlossen sind und sich nicht auftrennen. Zur Zeit arbeite ich mit einer 30 Jahre alten Gritzner 535 Nähmaschine, die über diese Funktion in leicht veränderter, aber nicht in formvollendeter Version verfügt.
 Des weiteren benötige ich unter anderem Bündchenstoffe:                                         diese umklappbaren Bündchen verleihen den einzelnen Teilen ihre lange Tragbarkeit über mehrere Kleidergrößen, und ersparen den Mamis einen monatlichen Neukauf.
Ich möchte dieses Projekt zu einem Kleinunternehmen aufbauen das sich 
voller Stolz präsentieren kann. Hierfür benötige ich eine Website, die 
einen kleine Onlineshop beherbergt.
We will need start-up capital to realize this Project, which i can´t adduce out of my own resources.
Working Material, for example in Form of a Overlockmachine. This Machine makes a high-quality Seam. It locks the Seam and makes sure that the Stitches don´t open anymore. I´m working with a 30 Years olf Gritzner 535, which doesn´t have this Function in the way i would need it.
I also need welt textiles: these foldable welts lend these uniques their durable existence through differend dress sizes, which save Mothers from a monthly purchase.
I want to build this Project into a small business, so it can present itself with full pride. For that i´ll need a Website which includes a small Onlineshop.
Die Auswirkung
The Effect
Ich bin Tag und Nacht mit Leidenschaft bei ""Frollein Tongtong"" am Werk, und überlege ständig was zu verbessern ist, wo es noch hakt, suche Lösungen und versuche sie umzusetzen. Finanziell bin ich nun an meine Grenzen gestoßen, und kann mich allein nicht erweitern. Ich möchte ""Frollein Tongtong"" zu einem kleinen Label machen, das gern gekauft und getragen wird, und wieder ein bisschen Vertrauen in den Slogan  ""Made in Germany"" gewinnen lässt. 
I´m Night and Day with all my Heart and Passion on ""Frollein Tongtong"", and always think about what to improve, i search for Solutions and try to implement them. I´m at my financial limits now, i can´t expand on my own. I want ""Frollein Tongtong"" transform into a Label which People love to by and Baby´s love to wear, and bring back the Trust into ""Made in Germany"".
Andere Wege, wie man helfen kann
Other Ways to helpIch freue mich natürlich auch sehr über Sachspenden :). Aber falls gerade niemand eine Overlockmaschine zu Verschenken hat, tut es auch das Verlinken meiner Kampagne. Ich danke jedem einzelnen von Euch für das Lesen, und überlegen ob und wie er das Projekt unterstützen kann.I´m always happy about all kind of donations :).But if no one having a Overlockmachine to giveaway, you also help me with sharing the Link to my Campaign. I´m thanking every single one of you for reading, and thinking about if and how he/she can support this Project!",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

It will be particularly useful in urban areas - you’ll easily know what is the closest green space regarding your current location and it will let you discover new places to explore with your buddy!(Resized gif - view original)       There are two physical modules, one for your furry friend (Pet module) and another for you (Guardian module). They are wirelessly connected to each other, and all you need to make them work is the Findster App!Here is a short demo video where you can actually see Findster Duo's main functionalities in action:The modules are rechargeable (a USB charger is included), lightweight and highly precise. Most importantly, the Pet modules are sturdy enough to accompany your best friends on the craziest of adventures!  
(Resized gif - view original) You may be asking yourself, “Why are two modules needed”? At the core of Findster Duo is the MAZE technology. Developed entirely by our team, it allows both modules to communicate wirelessly in a range of up to 2 miles (3.2 km), eliminating the need for a cellular connection to send the GPS coordinates - effectively removing the need for monthly fees!The Pet module can be attached to any collar using the included Velcro strap. This method of attachment provides versatility without sacrificing security.As for the Guardian module, you can carry it in your pocket and forget that it exists. It's as simple as that!  The original Findster system first came about in 2014. We put our idea to the test by creating a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo. It was a success, backed by over 1200 supporters from all over the world (over 50 countries!). We completed the system’s development, mass produced it and delivered it.Since then, we’ve been communicating closely with our backers, listening to their experiences and using their insights in order to create a new and upgraded version of the Findster GPS pet tracking device. One that doesn't just focus on location - but goes beyond that.That's actually the reason behind Findster Duo's name: using the system, you track your pets' whereabouts using GPS and monitor their wellness through their activity levels. It's a 2-in-1 winning combo! Plus it is actually the second edition of the Findster system, which fits nicely as well.Other notable improvements regarding the first version of the system include:

Higher GPS precision at a faster update rate: We redesigned the Hardware configuration to make this possible.

Longer communication range: with our new Maze protocol and our newly designed antennas, we managed to double the communication range.

Longer battery life: A larger battery is included, and we developed new battery-saving algorithms.
Much like the Avengers, our team consists of a bunch of superheroes who have united their powers for the greater good. The main difference being that, well, we don't have actual superpowers... But we're passionate about what we do and have the will to make a difference! Since 2016, Findster is alumni of HAX - the world’s #1 Hardware Startup accelerator! They’ve helped bring over 65 products to market in the last 3 years, so they have a lot of experience with this process. They'll help us with manufacturing, to make sure everything goes smoothly! You can read more about HAX here.We're also a part of the European Space Agency's Business Incubation Centre (ESA BIC). They provide us with comprehensive technical support, and their knowledge on space technology is helping us improve our system's GPS precision - plus their advanced equipment elevates our testing procedures to a different level. You can read more about ESA here.So we’ve got a solid base, the blueprints for the improvements and the tools to implement them - now we just need your help to turn our project into a reality!",26.0,2,"5 Campaigns

design studio on the world-famous Venice boardwalk. We draw our 
inspiration from what surrounds us and the end-result is a unique mix of
 the So-Cal lifestyle with a splash of international flare.</p>

<p>My name is Matt Randolph (**hello!) and I am here to appeal to you to help me set up what has long been an ambition of mine to put my skills and assets learnt throughout university into play and set up my first collection of innovative womenswear, initially to be sold on the website ASOS. </p>
<p>All about me, okay, So I graduated from Nottingham Trent University (in the UK) with a degree in Fashion design. I came out even poorer than when I went in. I knew what I wanted but I had to return home, after a while, to my parent's house in a picturesque little village in the peak district (near Sheffield). Beautiful and charming and perfectly idyllic - if you're retired!! </p>
<p>I know exactly what I want from life and how to attain it but it's all down to that vicious catch 22! .. No money and in the wrong place at the wrong time. If one of those can be achieved then surely I can get a little bit further to my dream than without either! I have a very strong support system from a variety of people and incredible design ideas just itching to be manufactured and produced!</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Right, where exactly is all this money going to go, I hear you ask your screen. I will need approximately just £8,000 to get this business up in the air. This is buying fabric and getting a manufacturer to produce it for me - trust me, it's costly stuff! Hopefully, the more I sell, the more money I make and the more independant I can be -- that's the plan anyway!</p>
<p>My 'dream' has already been partly achieved as I recently set up my business officially, so there's no denying that this business plan now has to happen!</p>
<p>Any extra money, which may not be much, will be a contribution towards marketting ideas I have lined up - fashion videos, shows and the like.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Obviously, money is very very supportive and I wouldn't be able to thank you all enough.

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>Keep your baby safe, from the first moment inside Mommy’s belly. StimElation is the only “smart wearable” in the maternity space. It provides: protection, support (for Mommy and Baby), early learning and health monitoring. It’s everything a parent (or auntie, or best friend) wants for a baby, from the very start.</p>
<p>StimElation is the dream come true for Dana Hawes, an educator and loving father of two beautiful children. Dana created the StimElation system with the goal of bonding with his son and daughter before they were born in spite of his hectic work schedule. The StimElation line is based on a washable cloth mesh product that—unlike current “baby belts” and “baby sound systems”—can be worn from conception to the 10th centimeter. Imagine that! Even when you are <em>planning</em> to have a baby, you can take important steps to protect your little one from harmful radiation, EMFs (<em>Electromagnetic Frequencies</em>, <em>for example, from microwaves and appliances, home and business wireless connections, random mobile WiFi hotspots, Bluetooth device connectivity in homes and vehicles and cell phone towers</em>) and electromagnetic radiation. When you're pregnant, you’ll want to use your smartphone and laptop to share all your good news! No need to worry about Baby’s well-being, StimElation will help keep your baby safe and sound.</p>
<p>The most important aspect of our product is protecting your baby from the invisible threats of EMFs and tracking your vital health signs. But there’s more! Our app lets parents, grandparents and other special people in Baby’s life create early bonds by recording bedtime stories or singing to the Baby. The washable speakers are positioned to optimize safety, stimulation and learning in utero—based on 20 years of research, and made safe by a comfortable blend of proprietary specialized fabrics.</p>

<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We are so excited to bring this product to market that we can hardly contain ourselves! If you or someone you love is pregnant or planning or trying… this is perfect timing. Production is in process—even our eco-friendly packaging is in the works.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Keep your baby safe, from the first moment inside Mommy’s belly. StimElation is the only “smart wearable” in the maternity space. It provides: protection, support (for Mommy and Baby), early learning and health monitoring. It’s everything a parent (or auntie, or best friend) wants for a baby, from the very start.
StimElation is the dream come true for Dana Hawes, an educator and loving father of two beautiful children. Dana created the StimElation system with the goal of bonding with his son and daughter before they were born in spite of his hectic work schedule. The StimElation line is based on a washable cloth mesh product that—unlike current “baby belts” and “baby sound systems”—can be worn from conception to the 10th centimeter. Imagine that! Even when you are planning to have a baby, you can take important steps to protect your little one from harmful radiation, EMFs (Electromagnetic Frequencies, for example, from microwaves and appliances, home and business wireless connections, random mobile WiFi hotspots, Bluetooth device connectivity in homes and vehicles and cell phone towers) and electromagnetic radiation. When you're pregnant, you’ll want to use your smartphone and laptop to share all your good news! No need to worry about Baby’s well-being, StimElation will help keep your baby safe and sound.
The most important aspect of our product is protecting your baby from the invisible threats of EMFs and tracking your vital health signs. But there’s more! Our app lets parents, grandparents and other special people in Baby’s life create early bonds by recording bedtime stories or singing to the Baby. The washable speakers are positioned to optimize safety, stimulation and learning in utero—based on 20 years of research, and made safe by a comfortable blend of proprietary specialized fabrics.

What We Need & What You Get
We are so excited to bring this product to market that we can hardly contain ourselves! If you or someone you love is pregnant or planning or trying… this is perfect timing. Production is in process—even our eco-friendly packaging is in the works.
Our projected date to release this awesome product is Mother’s Day 2014; however, early adopters will have bragging rights to this innovative baby shower gift up to six weeks before the general public can purchase it on the leading direct-marketing television network.

<li>There is no hassle free, cost effective way to RENT items in London from other people.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Solution</h3>
<p>A Web platform allowing users to rent out their items to individuals where:</p>
<ul>
<li>OWNERS can make money by renting out their unused or rarely used clothing and accessories.</li>

<p><strong><i>List your wardrobe - Make Money</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>Rent a wardrobe - Save Money </i></strong></p>
<p>We want to provide a new way for individuals to access fashion, for entrepreneurs to develop a business and for our users to connect and build fashion sharing communities. eStyle-List will bring together women, rental boutiques and fashion designers with women who love fashion and want access to an unlimited wardrobe without paying the high costs.</p>
<p>Using a seamless platform, eStyle-List wants to create opportunities for small boutique owners, up and coming fashion labels and individuals to set up and run their own rental boutiques whilst allowing our users to have access to a large variety of clothing and accessories in the most cost effective way possible. </p>

<li>Enables owners to list their items on the website and earn rental income. eStyle-List is taking underutilised assets (clothing, bags, shoes) and allowing the owners to turn these assets into an income.</li>
<li>The platform will incorporate a rating and review system for both owners and renters. Profiles and user reviews will help to build trust and reputation amongst the community.</li>
<li>Gives a cost effective solution to customers who need a specific product, but don’t want full ownership, to rent out items rather than buying them at full price.</li>
<li>A recent research report done by Future Market Insights expects the global online clothing rental market to be valued at US$ 1.9 billion by the end of 2026, indicating the growing preference of renting over owning and gaining instant access to ever changing fashion trends.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How will it work?</h3>
<ol>
<li>The Owner uploads photos and details of their item on to the eStyle-List website. </li>
<li>Users can search for items and browse available options according to rental dates, categories, sizes, designers etc.</li>
<li>The duration of rental and delivery date is chosen and item is rented through eStyle-List.</li>
<li>The item is collected from the owner by our own couriers and packaged and delivered to the renter. Our couriers then collect the item at the end of the rental period, have the item cleaned (optional) and returned back to the owner. The owner will get paid by eStyle-List with our commission deducted. </li>
</ol>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>Funding of £10,000 is required to complete the eStyle-List online platform.</li>
<li>Your donations will support the development of the eStyle-List website which will launch in 2017. If we exceed our target, we will use the additional funds to enhance overall user experience and stimulate business growth.</li>
<li>We have a range of attractive perks on offer for your generous donations to our campaign. Please note that as eStyle-List will initially launch in London, deliveries of orders will only be in the London area however deliveries and collections are not limited to residential addresses only and will include office addresses too . We will be expanding to other areas and cities as soon as possible.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>For eStyle-List to be successful we need to create a critical mass of users on both sides of the value chain so there is a sufficient supply of products and equally a high demand for products. We will achieve this by building an exceptionally user friendly web platform and incorporate an efficient payment processing system that will allow users to easily list and rent products. eStyle-List will have an in-house delivery network which gives complete flexibility for our users in terms of collections and deliveries, further adding to the ease and simplicity of listing and renting out items. Overall we will build a platform which will create a seamless, simple user experience and facilitate painless, trustworthy transactions.</li>
<li>We also need to make sure our users have trust in each other, owners of items to trust that their items will be returned to them in the same condition and renters to trust that the items they receive are of a good condition and standard.

<h2>Redefining golf. Thought for game-changers. </h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Hi, we are Untraced.</p>
<p>We only have one dream : <strong>making golf</strong> <strong>attractive</strong>, <strong>inclusive</strong> and <strong>fun</strong>. </p>
<p>To make this a reality, we will <strong>question</strong>, <strong>challenge</strong>, <strong>rethink</strong> and ultimately <strong>improve</strong> the traditional codes of golf...<b> </b>starting with<strong> the dress code.</strong></p>
<p>Today, we are delighted to introduce you to our <strong>brand new golf jacket and polo</strong>!</p>
<p>Designed <strong>based on your feedback</strong>, for both <strong>women and men </strong>and thought to answer the ultimate needs of golfers, we hope you’ll love them!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Introducing...</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1602482479/vgtlkir3rk0723bb2qu8.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h2>Why are we doing this ? </h2>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<p>Because today, <b>more than 75%</b> of golfers <strong>across the world</strong> are <strong>men</strong> over <strong>45</strong>...</p>
<p>Ridiculous right!?</p>
<p>While golf is an <strong>amazing sport</strong>, it carries around <strong>this image of a dusty « hobby for rich old men »</strong> that we are so eager to change.</p>
<p>Golf is <strong>vivid</strong>, <strong>colourful</strong> and <strong>full of challenges. </strong>It is perfect for<strong> self-development</strong>, and offers a real chance to connect with both nature and people. <strong>Everyone needs that!</strong></p>
<p>When this project first started, we wanted to get to the heart of the problem. We chatted to a lot of non-golfers, asking the same question to all of them: <strong>Why don’t you play golf?</strong></p>
<p>The answers were <strong>enlightening.</strong> We’ve picked out some of the best for you.</p>

Redefining golf. Thought for game-changers. 
 
Hi, we are Untraced.
We only have one dream : making golf attractive, inclusive and fun. 
To make this a reality, we will question, challenge, rethink and ultimately improve the traditional codes of golf... starting with the dress code.
Today, we are delighted to introduce you to our brand new golf jacket and polo!
Designed based on your feedback, for both women and men and thought to answer the ultimate needs of golfers, we hope you’ll love them!
 
Introducing...


Why are we doing this ? 
 

Because today, more than 75% of golfers across the world are men over 45...
Ridiculous right!?
While golf is an amazing sport, it carries around this image of a dusty « hobby for rich old men » that we are so eager to change.
Golf is vivid, colourful and full of challenges. It is perfect for self-development, and offers a real chance to connect with both nature and people. Everyone needs that!
When this project first started, we wanted to get to the heart of the problem. We chatted to a lot of non-golfers, asking the same question to all of them: Why don’t you play golf?
The answers were enlightening. We’ve picked out some of the best for you.
 


 

 
As we chatted with all of you, we realised that today’s golf dress code is a pain and needs a revamp from a cliche to something fun, attractive and practical. 
But most importantly, we realised that there is a huge lack of environmentally-responsible golf brand out there today. While golf is all about nature, the golf textile industry doesn’t reflect that. Let’s change it!
Join our adventure & question the codes ;)
 
Your jacket and polo in 3 key points 
 




 
What's your style? 
You have the choice between 2 jackets and 4 polos for women and men.

 

Hi, we are Arthur and Alexandra, and we created Untraced!

<p>Josh started Social Enterprise Stand4 Socks at the age of 24 after making an off the cuff comment with friends of <i><strong>""imagine if socks could change the world?"".</strong></i>  Most saw it as a joke, but Josh saw it differently. Pretty much everyone needs socks, but typically they are a dull, poorly made afterthought. So, he set about creating bold, high-quality, ethically made socks which start conversations about causes that matter. But he didn't stop there: inspired by TOMS shoes, he wanted each pair he sold to have an impact, but knew giving socks to people around the world was not the answer.  </p>

Innovating on the famous 'buy one, give one' model, each pair also has a tangible impact. Just one pair plants 10 trees, or another vaccinates 3 kids against measles or, clears landmines, provides education and so much more. One pair = One Impact. 

 
 


Every pair of socks is linked to an international cause, a non-profit and a measurable impact. From every pair of socks you purchase our charity partners fulfil the tangible impact. Picking out socks in the morning will no longer be a boring process - you select what you Stand4 each day. 

These socks have tangible impacts all over the world in over 14 different countries on over 11 different causes.  Stand4's socks are designed to be bold and noticed through over 20 limited edition designs allowing you to share the impact that your socks have had every single day. What will you Stand4? 

Each pair has a cause logo embroided on the outside of the ankle, intentionally visible to show the global cause your socks support. This could be from gender equality to education, clean water and much more - with the intention of showing the world what you 'Stand4'! 





(Yes! We are making socks from bamboo, and they are more advanced than other socks!) 
 

 



We have worked for years on creating the most advanced sock possible, that's both stylish and durable. We aim to provide the best functionality and comfort to the wearer, whilst also having the smallest possible impact on the environment. 

We align with the United Nations Global Goals. These are the biggest challenges the world is collectively facing to end poverty by 2030. Our socks currently have a tangible impact on 11 of the 17 goals. With two designs for each goal, we deliver impacts in over 14 different countries.


HUNGER: Landmines - Mines Advisory Group (MAG) 

MAG helps people to be safe from landmines and unexploded ordnance (UXO), free from danger, free from fear. We find landmines before children do. Just one pair of socks can remove unexploded landmines and UXO from 1 metre squared of land and destroy them, enabling communities to grow more food and make a better living. 

Good Health: Child Mortality - Women & Children First 
Every year, over three million children die before their 5th birthday. A large number of these deaths are from conditions that are treatable or preventable. Just one pair of Stand4 Socks vaccinates three children against measles in Bangladesh. 

Quality Education: Primary Education - WarChild 
Right now 75 million children are out of school in 35 crisis-affected countries. WarChild seeks to protect, educate and stand up for the rights of children caught up in war. Just one pair of Stand4s educates a child for 12.5 days affected in countries such as Iraq, Afghanistan and Jordan. 
Gender Equality: Domestic Violence Safe-house - Womankind 

In no country in the world do women enjoy the same rights or opportunities as men. WomenKind seek to challenge this through support, strengthening rights and building a movement for change. Just one pair of Stand4s can provide a night in a safe house in Ethiopia for a women and her children from domestic violence. 
Clean Water & Sanitation: Safe Water - Water.org   
Water is a fundamental human need, yet 663 million people worldwide lack access to safe water. Making water safe, accessible and cost effective in every country for every person, just one pair of Stand4s provides a year's safe water for one person in Ghana.  
Goal 7 - Affordable & Clean Energy:  - Power Up Gambia (PUG) 
In remote parts of Gambia it isn't a lack of hospitals, doctors or even equipment that leads to a high number of unnecessary deaths, but rather the lack of power for hospitals to operate. By simply adding renewable solar panels to rural hospitals, just one pair of socks can power a whole hospital for a night, saving lives and the planet.
Decent Work & Economic Growth: Micro Finance & Loans - Kiva Platform 
In a lot of developing countries, traditional financial systems are not commonplace. Micro loans are small loans to entrepreneurs. This could help a farmer in rural India to yield a better crop, or a women in Vietnam who wants to buy a sewing machine to grow her business. Each pair of Stand4s will create a $1 loan, we will pool this money and ask our backers where we should invest this pot. Once repaid, we will invest it over and over again in amazing projects. 
Climate Action: Sustainable Land Use - Stand4 Partners

Planting trees in around the world in countries like Uganda and Gambia helps not only the planet and soil quality, but it also creates jobs and opportunities. Through battling deforestation where trees are cut down for farming, or fuel, just one pair of Stand4s plants 10 trees.  
Eradicating Homelessness: Support - Stand4 Socks & Local Partners 

We chose to add homeless awareness socks outside of the UN Global Goals to also support a cause closer to home. Unfortunately, homelessness is on the rise in many developed countries. Even in the US has 550k registered homeless people. One pair purchases mean one thick pair antibacterial pair is donated directly to someone in need. 

Josh started Social Enterprise Stand4 Socks at the age of 24 after making an off the cuff comment with friends of ""imagine if socks could change the world?"".  Most saw it as a joke, but Josh saw it differently. Pretty much everyone needs socks, but typically they are a dull, poorly made afterthought. So, he set about creating bold, high-quality, ethically made socks which start conversations about causes that matter. But he didn't stop there: inspired by TOMS shoes, he wanted each pair he sold to have an impact, but knew giving socks to people around the world was not the answer.  

He saw the framework of the United Nations Global Goals, the biggest issues the world collectively is facing to eradicate poverty by 2030. Josh aligned his socks with causes from these goals, having impacts in multiple countries and for multiple causes from day one. 

Shortly after launching, Josh won Bronze as Great British Social Entrepreneur of the Year, which gave him the confidence that this was not such a crazy idea. Stand4 has developed slowly but now we need your help to scale this ambitious dream! 
The vision of Stand4 has always been to help create a world where every purchase, however big or small, has a positive impact on the world.... and if we can do that with socks then surely we can do it with anything, right? 
 

Our socks are all designed in the UK and manufactured in Europe. We only use Sedex Audited Factories to produce our socks. All of our yarns come from  BSCI or Oeko-tex accredited suppliers. The packaging for our socks is also only made using FSC paper, from sustainable forests and recycled card. 
The costs of this and the minimum orders are high. However, we wouldn't make our socks any other way. This is why we need your help to bring this new product development to reality. We have created and tested the product and now need to raise at least £10k to purchase the yarns. Hopefully creating the worlds best socks, which also have a huge impact to the lives of others!

Want your socks gift packaged? No problem just let us know on your order confirmation form after the campaign ends for complimentary gift boxing! 
 

We are all unique, globally valuing causes differently. Whether it's the United Nations Global Goals such as 'no equalities' or 'climate action', or other causes such as eradicating cancer or homelessness. What matters to you, and do you Stand4?

<p><b>----------<br/>UNIQUE - STABILITY ACHIEVED BY FIXING IN A SINGLE POINT</b><br/>Baggizmo is fixed in a single point (over one shoulder), but the arrangement of elements (compartments and device weight ratio) take the brunt of the bag (gravity) so that it is fixed to the body during usual body movements (walking, sitting, standing up, gently tilting etc.). In this way the bag does not slip to one side, although it is strapped only to one shoulder.</p>
<p><b>Stability during high level body's activity</b><br/>For more active body movements (running, sharp leans forward as on a bike, jumping etc.), stability is additionally achieved by using the strap that secures the bag diagonally across the torso and positions it below the left arm. The bag is then additionally fixed in the second point by using a buckle (bike hook shackle) that attaches to the pants, belt or back pocket.</p>

If “wearable tech” is the next frontier, Baggizmo can take you there today – by helping you wear your tech properly. Even when it's full, it appears slim and feels comfortable – thanks to its elegant, form-fitting design. It looks good in combination with a range of styles – business, sporty, casual or formal.
It's not just a bag for your gizmos, but it offers a unique way in how the bag is worn from the beginning. It uses brilliant design to provide a simple and stylish solution for the man who cannot go anywhere without his gadgets. Baggizmo puts all your technology at your fingertips – by placing it under your arm.
 
Easy to wear, highly functional with numerous compartments specially designed to look slim even when it’s full, made ergonomically with high-quality innovative materials which will make you look good, feel good and carry on with your day.----------You can wear Baggizmo while driving, riding a bike, attending a meeting or dining out. You can wear it above or below a suit jacket. This means you won't spoil the lines of your tailored clothing by stuffing the pockets with bulky gadgets. Baggizmo is the first bag of its kind, tailored for men and their gizmos, both functional and fashionable.  
 
----------Baggizmo has achieved high ergonomy 
Baggizmo is designed by the design collective, Manufakturist.Our designers tested various body positions in which the bag has to function in a way that the gadgets are easy accessible and that the bag doesn’t move around the body in uncontrolled directions. They were careful to arrange objects according to weight, so that one part of the bag would not outweigh another.
 

 Baggizmo’s shape has been conditioned around a polygonal pattern that has enabled the good grip of the bag to the torso, while the possibility of regulating the length of the straps provides customization depending on a man's proportions.The bag's dimensions have been kept to a minimum due to the content of each compartment, thus limiting the ""overload"" which threatens its stability on the body and comfort of wearing and using Baggizmo.
 
 
 
  ----------Truly a bag of tricks! 
Baggizmo’s design smartly merges tech-aware and contemporary urban fashion, promoting a new trend in wearing tech devices among men. ---------- 

 
----------THE NEW WAY OF HOW THE BAG IS WORN – MOBILEBaggizmo offers a unique way in how the bag is worn from the beginning. There is no need to take it off during many of your daily activities - while you are driving a car, riding a bike, having a meeting or enjoying dinner in a restaurant. 
 ----------STAYS SLIM FIT EVEN WHEN IT’S FULL Even when it’s full, Baggizmo's shape stays slim, following the lines of the body thanks to an adjustable (and comfortable) padded shoulder strap and the bag's material.
----------UNIQUE – FITTING VARIOUS OUTFITS! You can wear Baggizmo over a T-shirt, shirt, then under or over a jacket or a business suit.

It looks aesthetically pleasing in various outfits – whether it's casual, sporty, business or smart!
 
 
 ----------GREATER COMFORT Special attention has been given to the thickness of the straps in order to achieve greater comfort. The width of the straps was defined with respect to the width of the average man's shoulders.
 
 

----------THE GADGETS ARE EASY ACCESSIBLE The bag was designed to allow easy access to the gadgets following the natural angle of entry of a hand reaching inside for objects.
 
Baggizmo is available in both Left and Right Sided Options.
 

----------RATIONALLY ORGANIZED SPACE The space in Baggizmo is rationally organized - the direction and the size of the compartments depend on the size of its corresponding device – which are: a tablet, two smartphones, keys, wallet, power stick, pencil and a pad of paper, etc.
 
 
 
 
 ----------NFC TAG INTEGRATED The Baggizmo has integrated an NFC tag in the top front pocket.
 
NFC (near field communication) is a wireless technology which allows for transfer of data such as texts or numbers and transfer to another NFC device, such as a mobile phone.
There's a whole set of different data types you can store on an NFC tag. You may choose to store a web address, a vCard ID, a LinkedIn profile link, a Dropbox share, a telephone number etc. For example, rather than share your business cards at a conference simply pass on your information via NFC enabled smartphones.
An NFC tag doesn't require batteries and it's durable and waterproof. It can be reprogrammed, so you can change the information you want to transfer, depending on your needs. It can be reliably read by most devices and mobile phones.
 

----------NO MORE TANGLED CABLES – CONNECTEDIn between the compartments there are specially tailored (hidden) passages which allow the charging of a tablet with a power stick or connecting a phone with headphones. A pocket for headphones is placed on the padded shoulder strap. It helps avoid tangled cables while you have your headphones as close as you need – as you sit, walk or drive.

 

 

----------IT DOESN'T MOVE AROUND! The bag doesn’t move around the body in uncontrolled directions. The compartments designed for the corresponding device are carefully arranged according to weight, so that one part of the bag would not outweigh another. 
----------UNIQUE - STABILITY ACHIEVED BY FIXING IN A SINGLE POINTBaggizmo is fixed in a single point (over one shoulder), but the arrangement of elements (compartments and device weight ratio) take the brunt of the bag (gravity) so that it is fixed to the body during usual body movements (walking, sitting, standing up, gently tilting etc.). In this way the bag does not slip to one side, although it is strapped only to one shoulder.
Stability during high level body's activityFor more active body movements (running, sharp leans forward as on a bike, jumping etc.), stability is additionally achieved by using the strap that secures the bag diagonally across the torso and positions it below the left arm. The bag is then additionally fixed in the second point by using a buckle (bike hook shackle) that attaches to the pants, belt or back pocket.

 ----------IT'S SAFE All the compartments have internal cushioning and are also lined with several layers of material that provide special protection against mechanical or heat damage. ----------MATERIALS AND ORIGINAL DESIGN ELEMENTSComfort and wearing convenience have also been determined by the choice of quality materials that cling to the body, but still allow the circulation of air between the bag and the body. ----------Baggizmo is made of quality and innovative materials that provide special protection against mechanical or heat damage. 
----------The Innovative textile Baggizmo is made from Schoeller®-dynatec, an innovative material that is abrasion resistant, fall protection, breathable, 2-way--stretch, UV stops, wind and water repellent. The material is made of hard wearing fabric with good protective properties and a high level of stability. It is pleasant to the touch and can cope with heavy demands and has an attractive appearance.
 
 
 
 
 Schoeller® (Switzerland, EU) produces highly-functional fabrics and innovative textile technologies for sport, work, lifestyle, fashion  and office furnishings. They pay close attention to ecological safety and good design. Innovation in the design of fabrics had won them awards and put them in a leading position in pioneering changes.Back of the bag The back of the Baggizmo bag is made from breathable mesh material from Schoeller®-spirit fabrics. It’s cosy and comfortable, has good breathability and perfect weather protection. Its special mesh structures ensure ventilation combined with good protection. Baggizmo buckles The buckles are an original Baggizmo design produced in the EU (Croatia) just for this bag. The buckles are made from Zamak, part of the zinc aluminium alloy family, with a satin nickel surface treatment. Both buckles, silver or black matt finishing, have a really nice metal look and feel. The matt finishing is achieved with a high performance cataphoretic lacquer with improved wear resistance. 
 
 
 Inner lining material - microfiberThis ultra-fine fiber is lightweight, durable, but soft and electrostatic. It is very good to use for gadget pockets, because the material is often used to clean screens. And your Baggizmo gadget pockets will ensure that your screens are always clean.Baggizmo strapsThe straps are made in the EU (Belgium) of a superb mixed composition weave with a soft fiber feel but are rugged and unusually resistant atthe same time.  Baggizmo tailoringBaggizmo is tailored from more than 30 parts of fabric with 90 separate actions that must be performed to a ready-sewn bag. In some parts of the bag Baggizmo has 6 layers of materials and internal cushioning to be combined. Due to the complex and highly functional design, Baggizmo has a total of 12 layers of materials in a bag thickness of only one centimeter (0.4 inch). ----------
Baggizmo is made in the EU.

<p>Through bag sales, we fund non-profits providing sports opportunities to girls worldwide. Having worked in international development, we know that each non-profit partner will have unique needs and goals; so we structure bag sales around meeting those specific needs.</p>
<h2>Nicaragua Project (Soccer Without Borders)</h2>
<p>Through hitting our 25K milestone in this campaign, we raised funds to help Soccer Without Borders (SWB) Nicaragua <strong>build a soccer field and support their community center.</strong> These projects address a significant barrier to girls' sports in Nicaragua: lack of safe spaces. SWB Nicaragua reaches 130 girls and women ages 7-25, and serves close to 1,200 girls through school outreach.</p>

<h2><strong>Uganda Project (Soccer Without Borders)<br/></strong></h2>
<p>SWB also has soccer programs for teenage girls in Uganda.<strong> </strong>It's difficult to keep the girls enrolled, because of outside responsibilities and pressures to find work. Through our 50K milestone in this campaign, we've raised funds to <strong>incorporate vocational training classes into the program</strong>, adding value for the girls and ensuring they continue to prioritize involvement in the soccer program.</p>

<h2>Ethiopia Project (Girls Gotta Run)</h2>
<p>Bekoji is an Ethiopian village that has a history of producing world-class distance runners (you've probably seen them in the Olympics). The Girls Gotta Run Foundation is working to make female running a part of this culture. In closing out this campaign at 68K, we will be able to help support the <strong>training and funding of Bekoji's first ever female coach</strong>!</p>

<p><strong>Can you explain more about the bag cost?</strong></p>
<p>We've learned SO much about bag production, and hope that sharing some info sheds light on the price point.  We've got a bit of a ""triple whammy"" situation: (i) we're making this run in the U.S. (which we love, but is costly) (ii) we're not producing in huge numbers like the big brands out there (which means higher cost per bag); and (iii) we build in a donation (we're committed to having it be a meaningful percentage).  For Indiegogo, we're also including shipping costs.</p>

CAMPAIGN ACHIEVEMENTS:
25K milestone: soccer field in Nicaragua (Soccer Without Borders)
50K milestone: training programs for soccer team in Uganda (Soccer Without Borders)
68K: female running coach in Ethiopia (Girls Gotta Run)

We're on a mission: to help girls play sports by creating awesome athletic bags for women.

Sports address many issues girls worldwide face. Studies show a girl who plays sports:

Is less likely to get pregnant or engage in risky sexual behavior
Is less likely to stay in an abusive relationship
Has reduced risk of breast cancer, diabetes, osteoporosis and other chronic diseases
Achieves higher levels of education, and does better in school and work
Gains confidence, positive body image, resilience, and leadership skills
Is less likely to suffer from depression
Improving girls’ lives in these ways has a ripple effect, impacting communities and... the world. 


Collaborating with a former designer for Betsey Johnson and bagmaker from Quiksilver, we spent over a year creating a functional, yet fashion-forward bag that meets the needs of active women.
Our first line is made of macen, the ""material of the people"" in Activyst’s birthplace of Nicaragua and used for everything from hammocks, to harvesting coffee, to transporting goods. Activyst bags are durable, waterproof, have awesome features, and are pretty cute to boot.
Active Bag Features
Our pride and joy, the Active Bag, has pockets for your shoes, yoga mat, laptop and personal items.


Through bag sales, we fund non-profits providing sports opportunities to girls worldwide. Having worked in international development, we know that each non-profit partner will have unique needs and goals; so we structure bag sales around meeting those specific needs.
