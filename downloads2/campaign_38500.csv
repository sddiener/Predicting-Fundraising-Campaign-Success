<div>My name is Nikki McGaughey and as anyone who knows me knows, I love animals.  My facebook is a testament to that, as my friends are bombarded with daily doses of dogs, rats, and whatever exotics are on my plate at that point in time.</div>
<div>I have been a dog trainer for two years now, and absolutely adore my job.  However, as it is very difficult to make a living wage as a dog trainer, I have been soul searching for years.  I have had internships various places, most notably at Tamarack Wildlife Rehabilitation and Education Center, where I spent a summer caring for rehabilitated raptors, raising mourning doves and baby opossums.  This past summer I completed an internship at the Erie Zoo where I worked with hoofstock, small mammals, and primates.  Working with the white cheeked gibbons, siamangs, and orangutans was wonderful.  Seeing their individual personalities, struggling through the orangutan spit until they finally accepted me (mostly) and having the female, Dasa, come up to the glass just to spend time with me changed my life.  I realized that helping conserve primates through research is my calling.</div>
<div>I have already been interviewed and accepted into this well established, competitive internship program based in Panama.  Now it is up to help from people like you to help me.  By funding this trip, you will help me reach my dreams.  Working at Alouatta as an intern will be the next step in my life. I can help with mantled howler monkeys, and take that experience and use it to further my education in graduate school.</div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>Where Will My Money Be Going?</h3>
<div>The internship for two weeks to one month is $850 plus tax.  This ends up as being $918 for the experience gained and time taken by staff to train. This money is due by October 31st.   Happy Halloween!</div>
<div>Airfare is not included, and from what I gather, it is around $580 for a round trip flight from Erie to David, Panama.</div>
<div>After these major expenses, simple things like taxi to and from the airport, supplies, such as bug spray and sunscreen, both of which I will need copious amounts of, and Panama-specific clothing are all essential, and like all good things in life, are not free at all.</div>
<div>As much as I'd love to reach it, I'm not sure $2000 is a realistic goal.  If I do not reach my goal, all of the money will go towards the internship still.  As I graduate in December and the internship starts January first, it is likely that I will be as broke as broke can be at that point in time, unless this whole McDonald's monopoly thing works out in my favor.</div>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>This internship will of course help me.  The experience will help my resume, give me that extra edge that I need to in order to get into graduate schools.  I am applying to five different schools for physical anthropology, and hope to hear back from them as soon as possible.</div>
<div>This internship will also help mantled howler monkeys.  At Alouatta, they care for orphaned and injured monkeys, and other animals that need their help.  They also do research on howler monkey cognition, populations, and diet.</div>
<div>The real question though, let's be honest.  How does this internship help you, the funder? To answer that we will need a time travel device, and since I am a big Dr. Who fan, let's jump in the Tardis for a Jiff. We are whirring to the future, approximately 2020 in the United States.  A young woman, we'll call her Darla, sits in a lecture hall dreaming of making the world a better place and helping animals.  Her professor, Dr. McGaughey approaches. ""Why are you so dismal miss Darla?""  ""Well Dr. McGaughey I am not sure what to do with my life."" she replies.  Dr. McGaughey ponders this and says, ""Darla when I was your age, I felt the same.  A new college graduate, searching for purpose in this world.  That was when I began looking at internships, and found one for a place called Alouatta.  I was aware that it was very competitive, but applied anyways.  I got the interview and eventually the position, and then I realized cost.  No one seemed excited.  They all just spoke of cost this and cost that. I was disheartened.  Then finally I realized, I could do this.  I would reach out to friends, family, coworkers, anyone who would listen.  I would swallow my pride and ask for help.  And it came.  Help came by the fives.  One five dollar donation here, one there, and boom! I had my goal. I could go to Panama, learn all I could, not feel guilty about the cost and the damper that it would put on my bank account.  I went, and now here I am.  Doing field research on great apes, and my discoveries about their culture not only led to their conservation, but better understanding of human origins.  That Darla, is the finest example of caring I have seen.  Do not give up on your dreams.""  Darla went on to create her own indiegogo and continue the cycle of excellence thanks to contributors like you.  Whiiirr Whirrrr Whiiiirrr.  And now you are back into your own time, 2014, still in the United States.</div> <p><br/></p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>There are obvious risks associated with traveling to Panama.  Due to the possibility my mother is reading this, I will not share all of these risks, but some are worth mentioning.</p>
<p>For example, during my interview I consented to my mother that I would ask about dangers there.  I was promptly told that it was safe, we wear bullet proof pant things that are impenetrable to snake fangs.  I mean, come on guys, that's safe, right?  He also told me about his worst case scenario, I mean he's lived there a few years, he knows the ins and outs, so I braced myself.  He said that the worst that had happened to him was he was crossing a stream and a bee stung him multiple times and he woke up three days later.  I mean worse has happened right? </p>
<p>There are health risks, but other than that, you have a sound investment.  I am already accepted and willing to help all the monkeys of the world, if only you will help fund me.</p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Nikki that's a nice story, but I'm broke!</h3> <p>If you cannot help fund me, at least share my story.  I hope I have made you smile once or twice as you read through this, share this smile with a rich friend or two.   Any support is more than welcome.  Thank you so much for even considering helping a middle class girl reach a dream she never thought possible.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE (5/13/12):</strong> We are no longer seeking founding sponsors for recognition on our homepage. Thank you to those who contributed. After weeks of sifting through proposals and discussions with web design companies, we have selected a company to build our new website. We feel they will be able to deliver exactly the product we are looking for and we are excited to work with them.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE (5/2/12):</strong> We are actively seeking sponsors at the $1,000+ level for the construction of our new website. Individuals and businesses that contribute at least that amount will have their company logo and name placed on the home page with a link to their website, FOREVER (only 15 spaces available). If you are interested, you can donate here or contact us at admin@sustainablefriends.org. This is not only a great business opportunity, but also a great way to be a part of the next GREAT environmental website!</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE (4/27/12):</strong> We have attached screenshots of two proposals to give everyone an idea of what we've been receiving from web design companies. We have omitted the rest of the proposal and the company identities to protect their intellectual property.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>My name is Bobby Khaksari. A few friends and I have come up with a website concept we feel is game-changing and will LEAD THE WAY to a more sustainably developed world. It is called Sustainable Friends. No fancy youtube video here. Instead, we put our energy into creating a simple website that highlights what we aim to do. You can go to <a href=""http://www.sustainablefriends.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.sustainablefriends.org</a> to learn more.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, we have decided that in order for us to achieve our goal, the current site and platform will not suffice. It needs to be rebuilt from scratch, with custom programming and graphics. This will give the site a more professional look, complete functionality, and presence.</p>
<p>This is a topic that we are extremely passionate about and we hope everyone else is too. At the very least, we hope you visit the site to learn more about our goals and sign the petition when the final site is launched.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We had no idea at first, but creating a custom, professional website with the functionality we have envisioned and the intent to rival sites like Green Peace and Friends of the Earth, costs a pretty penny. We have submitted an 8-page Word document with detailed site requirements to ten different web design companies and have received bid proposals from them. After crunching the numbers, we have come up with a 30-day fundraising goal of $15,000. Donations will be used to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Build and launch the initial website</li>
<li>Receive support and website adjustments for the first six (6) months (the estimated time it will take us to finalize everything, work out the bugs, and learn how to administer the site ourselves)</li>
</ol>
<p>All funds will be used for these two purposes. Any funds that are raised and left over after six months will be re-donated to other environmental causes. We are open to suggestions about this! If we don't reach our goal, we will save whatever amount is raised and continue fundraising until the goal is reached. We're not stopping until we get there!</p>
<h3>What You Get (The Perks)</h3>
<p>Be sure to check out the perks you get in return for donating. We will not be providing any material goods. We don't really believe in that. Instead, we will be recognizing people (and/or any GREEN entity you want to promote) on our home page and/or on a dedicated ""founding donors"" page for the entire life of the site (forever?). If you don't want to be recognized, please let us know. Our anticipated launch is late August 2012.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In order to realize any tangible change, it takes participation and cooperation from many, many individuals. And what better way to reach and engage the highest amount of people than on the world wide web! Just like votes in an election, your participation and efforts that stem from using the SF website will add up to measurable results. Together, we will reduce climate changing greenhouse gas emissions, bring people out of poverty responsibly, and preserve habitats, biodiversity, and natural systems that provide humans with countless life-sustaining services. As the famous Native American saying goes:</p>
<p>""Humankind has not woven the web of life. We are but one thread within it. Whatever we do to the web, we do to ourselves. All things are bound together. All things connect.""</p>
<p>We all have a stake in this, and it isn't the environment that needs to be saved, it's us.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can’t contribute, please spread the word about Sustainable Friends! Share our pages on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and any other social media platforms you can think of. Tell your family, friends, and co-workers. At the absolute minimum, sign the petition!</p>
<p>If you are a ""green"" business, non-profit, or website, add yourself to our list of ""friends"". If you are an expert, create a profile and answer questions from the public.</p>
<p>To put it simply, join the movement!</p>

<p><b>The Sea
Musketeers are an educational outreach society that endeavour to protect the
oceans through creativity and spirit of adventure.</b></p>
<p><b><b>With this project, we aim to bring the forefront of marine research to the classroom.</b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>THE PROBLEM</b></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">We use billions of plastic
bags and bottles every year, some of them only a single time, before we throw
them away. Most of this plastic waste is not recycled, and a vast amount
accidentally ends up in our rivers, lakes and oceans. Sunlight and waves can
fragment the plastic, but this only turns it into smaller pieces that end up in
the marine food chain.</span><br/></p>
<p>In oceans and lakes, bits of
plastic act like sponges and soak up toxins from the ecosystem. Hundreds of
species in the ocean ingest plastic unwittingly. Today, we know that
these toxins, have ended up in <i>our</i> food
chain.</p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">But there is still a lot to discover... </b><br/></p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Are plankton, animals at the bottom of the marine food chain, eating tiny bits of plastic? </b></p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Is this plastic entering our food chain as well?</b></p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">OUR MISSION - Sail into the Atlantic</b><br/></p>
<p>In October, we will sail into the Atlantic
Ocean on a discovery expedition aboard a 72ft oceanographic vessel, the <i>Sea Dragon</i>. The vessel will enter the North
Atlantic <a href=""http://5gyres.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Gyre</span></a>, departing from the Azores Islands and
landing in Lanzarote, the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>The aim is to investigate tiny plastic fragments, known as microplastics. On-board
biologists from Exeter University will be looking for evidence that plankton are ingesting microplastics in the open ocean.</p>
<p>The Sea Musketeers will collect video
footage, photographs and information to create a free, online educational

Who We Are

The Sea
Musketeers are an educational outreach society that endeavour to protect the
oceans through creativity and spirit of adventure.
With this project, we aim to bring the forefront of marine research to the classroom.
THE PROBLEM
We use billions of plastic
bags and bottles every year, some of them only a single time, before we throw
them away. Most of this plastic waste is not recycled, and a vast amount
accidentally ends up in our rivers, lakes and oceans. Sunlight and waves can
fragment the plastic, but this only turns it into smaller pieces that end up in
the marine food chain.
In oceans and lakes, bits of
plastic act like sponges and soak up toxins from the ecosystem. Hundreds of
species in the ocean ingest plastic unwittingly. Today, we know that
these toxins, have ended up in our food
chain.
But there is still a lot to discover... 
Are plankton, animals at the bottom of the marine food chain, eating tiny bits of plastic? 
Is this plastic entering our food chain as well?
OUR MISSION - Sail into the Atlantic
In October, we will sail into the Atlantic
Ocean on a discovery expedition aboard a 72ft oceanographic vessel, the Sea Dragon. The vessel will enter the North
Atlantic Gyre, departing from the Azores Islands and
landing in Lanzarote, the Canary Islands.
The aim is to investigate tiny plastic fragments, known as microplastics. On-board
biologists from Exeter University will be looking for evidence that plankton are ingesting microplastics in the open ocean.
The Sea Musketeers will collect video
footage, photographs and information to create a free, online educational
resource. Our objective is to bring ocean exploration to schools as well as the public eye. We want to educate but mostly ro INSPIRE SOLUTIONS.
Teachers will be able to use these resources to enhance their curriculum and engage their students about this important topic.
WHY IT MATTERS
Knowledge is power!
The sea is a giant playground of opportunity, but only if its harnessed with knowledge and understanding. The Sea Musketeers want to give future generations the ability to make greener, smarter, more informed and forward thinking choices. This educational pack is a step towards the type of information that is invaluable in a future that will be driven by renewable technology and sustainable living.
The project has an
international scope and if fully funded, our digital resources will be
simultaneously developed in English, French and Italian. 

What in the world is a Gyre?
Ocean gyres are rotating
current systems in the oceans. Floating pieces of plastic at sea are swept into
these massive circular currents. The plastic can be trapped there for decades…Plastic
pollution can travel around the planet in five main ocean Gyres,
where it collects in large patches and even forms giant floating plastic
islands, like the notorious Great Pacific Garbage Patch.

HOW YOU CAN HELP
We would like you to help us fund our
voyage aboard the Sea Dragon in order for us to create a
compelling, current and truthful account of our oceans today.
In return for your donations we will make you part of our expedition - keeping you up to date along the way about our scientific goals and our voyage itinerary aboard the majestic Sea Dragon. We will also send you exclusive photographs of our fantastic voyage and Sea Musketeer swag to help you reduce plastic pollution.
Donations from £10 upwards will help us reach our £18,000 goal.
£8000 will fully fund our

 £10 000 will
cover costs for filming, photography and sailing equipment

<p>Reclining in his hammock and fiddling with his handmade flute, Santiago Campillo, the leader of Armila's folk music group Gammibe Gun Galu, explains: “<a href=""http://gammibegungalu.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The songs we play</a> are the songs God taught to each animal so that they could greet him with music when he visited mother earth.”  This rhythmic, soothing music he references, reminiscent of singing birds and lumbering tapirs (a cuddly-looking relative of the rhino), embodies the spirit of the Guna culture.  It is only appropriate that their music be the music of other animals: Guna tradition upholds the value of other species and lays the foundation for a harmonious relationship between man and nature.<br/><br/>Luckily for the rest of the world, the indigenous Guna are the stewards of one of the world's disappearing treasures: leatherback sea turtles.  Thousands of these enormous creatures nest in the 4km of beach of Guna village of Armila, Panama, making it one of the world’s most important nesting sites for this critically endangered species.  As over-exploitation causes the leatherback to disappear from the Pacific ocean, this incredible extraordinary concentration is made possible by the Guna's culture, which prohibits the consumption of sea turtles or their eggs.  Instead, Armila’s residents allow their ancient kin (as tradition still calls them) to nest in peace.</p>
<p><strong>But times are changing.</strong></p>
<p>Both turtles and the music face an uncertain future.  Population growth and diminishing availability of fish have brought the human-turtle relationship to a critical head.  Western influences are wearing away at the Guna culture, and long-held taboos that prohibit the exploitation of turtles are going with it.  New financial pressures on families means that certain elements of their culture, such as the town's unique musical tradition, are being left behind.  If their needs are not addressed, both the music and the turtles may succumb to the same fate of their counterparts elsewhere: gradually (or rapidly) fading away.</p>
<p><strong>This campaign emerged from the combined effort of Armila’s Sea Turtle Commission and the local music group, Gammibe Gun Galu, along with the support of the local, state, and federal government, to simultaneously safeguard their culture and their precious population of sea turtles.     </strong></p>

<p>Breaking The Brand of Rhino Horn in Viet Nam<br/><br/>This campaign follows the success of our pilot RhiNo campaign 'Is it worth the risk?', where after raising $30,000 we were able to place 19 adverts in three key business and the top selling women’s magazines; including 2 consecutive months in Heritage, the in-flight magazine of Viet Nam Airlines. <br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d3nm4kec9k9dav.cloudfront.net/uploads/11-2014/1415489963.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>To keep the pressure on the primary users of rhino horn in Viet Nam Breaking The Brand wants to launch a 5-week follow up campaign 'Will your luck run out....'. Rhino horn gifts and use in a 'millionaire detox drink' spike leading up to and over the Vietnamese New Year (Tet) celebration.

<p>100% of funds raised will go into producing and publishing the ads in Vietnamese magazines targeting the primary users of rhino horn. See the image above for the ads we used in our pilot campaign, which we launched in mid-September. <br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d3nm4kec9k9dav.cloudfront.net/uploads/11-2014/1415491729.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>In addition to the magazines, light box and poster adverts will also be placed in exclusive California Fitness and Yoga Clubs in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, which are frequented by our target audience.<br/><br/>We need a total of $30,000 to run a 5-week campaign in publications and locations that are best suited to reaching the primary rhino horn users. With $10,000 we can produce the new ads (cost is around $1,000 for image processing and translation) and buy placements in one of the magazines for 5 weeks. This is the minimum viable campaign. Any additional funds we raise via Indiegogo will go into placing ads in additional magazines.<br/></p>

I love your messaging style as you keep things simple but very creative at the same time. I believe that your messaging works well for Vietnamese. <br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/>Dr. Stephen Saunders, Department of Marketing, Monash University: “Congratulations on the launch of your advertising campaign. As an academic interested in consumer studies, I have always been a strong supporter of marketing initiatives that directly target the end-user, and surprised that there are not more organisations such as yours that prioritise a consumer-oriented strategy in tackling the rhino horn problem. I think that your current campaign strikes a good balance between awareness, education, stigmatisation, shock and emotional response. Something that has been lacking, in my opinion, in many of the other campaigns that seem to broadly focus on general education and awareness”.</span><br/></p>
<p><span>Also in a recent visit to Viet Nam to get some initial feedback and first impressions of our pilot campaign, a conversation with one Vietnamese businessman proved interesting. He said: <br/><br/>“When I saw the adverts I told a friend whose child has cancer; I know they were using rhino horn. My friend was shocked and wondered why the people of Viet Nam weren't been told about rhino horn poisoning. The family said that they will finish the piece of horn that they have, but they won’t buy any more as they don’t want to risk giving their sick child poisoned rhino horn.” Whilst this is just one story and we didn't hear it directly from the family it does provide a glimmer of hope for the rhino. Like anywhere in the world, in Viet Nam what you hear from your peer network has an impact on what you buy and do. If this family are talking to their peer group about their new concerns regarding using rhino horn, our hope is that over time this massage will spread, including on social media. Similarly, we hope that people, such as this family, may talk more openly to local conservation groups and the media about their decisions to stop buying rhino horn.</span><br/></p>

<h3>Make your home a Pono Home and save!</h3>
<p>Greening our homes is the biggest opportunity to help us break our dependence on fossil fuels and reduce our exposure to petrochemical ingredients. In every home across America, even the best intentioned citizens may not know some of the simplest green changes they can make (or how to make them): </p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">What temperature their water heater should be set to for maximum efficiency (120 F), or </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">how to set it (ummm...)</span>
</li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">How many lumens of light that are ideal in their bathroom (errr..., what?)</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">How many gallons of water are wasted per minute in the shower </span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">What the difference is between a power strip and a smart strip or how to install them for maximum efficiency</span></li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">How to identify potentially carcinogenic ingredients in personal care products....</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>The list goes on, and it quickly gets overwhelming, causing many people to do...nothing. Meanwhile, hard earned money goes to pay utility bills that come with a big carbon footprint, leaving less to spend on healthy food and nontoxic personal care products. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>We think there's a better way, which is why we invented Pono Home. </b></p>

<i>Clockwise from top left: checking and installing water efficiency at the tap; testing appliances for energy use to show you how much you can save with simple behavioral changes; a sampling of the energy efficient lighting options we can install, cleaning condenser coils to maximize refrigerator efficiency; water efficiency for the toilet; and showing drivers how to drive more fuel-efficiently. Other services are more oriented toward ingredients in food and personal care products, and others, like cleaning out the dryer lint vent, are not only good for efficiency but make your home more fire safe, too!</i><p></p>
<p>We show up with the hardware and know-how to make your home greener, and we make it happen, right on the spot. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">In just a few hours, your home will be cleaner, healthier, and more efficient.

<p></p></div>","Make your home a Pono Home and save!
Greening our homes is the biggest opportunity to help us break our dependence on fossil fuels and reduce our exposure to petrochemical ingredients. In every home across America, even the best intentioned citizens may not know some of the simplest green changes they can make (or how to make them): 


What temperature their water heater should be set to for maximum efficiency (120 F), or how to set it (ummm...)

How many lumens of light that are ideal in their bathroom (errr..., what?)
How many gallons of water are wasted per minute in the shower 
What the difference is between a power strip and a smart strip or how to install them for maximum efficiency

How to identify potentially carcinogenic ingredients in personal care products....



The list goes on, and it quickly gets overwhelming, causing many people to do...nothing. Meanwhile, hard earned money goes to pay utility bills that come with a big carbon footprint, leaving less to spend on healthy food and nontoxic personal care products. 
We think there's a better way, which is why we invented Pono Home. 

Pono Home is a green home consulting service currently doing business in Honolulu County. It was recently selected for inclusion in Hawaii's clean tech incubator, the Energy Excelerator, beating out hundreds of innovative and qualified clean tech startups: 



""Pono Home provides simple, easy-as-pie energy efficiency solutions for homeowners and renters.  Our Energy Excelerator selected Pono Home for our 2014 cohort (from more than 200 companies that applied) because we love that they turn home energy efficiency from complicated to delightful.  It's companies like Pono Home that not only are helping people save money, but also are helping the state reduce our dependence on imported oil.""                --Dawn Lippert, Senior Manager, Energy Excelerator

What happens during a Pono Home visit?

Our service is pure convenience. Rather than recommend what you should do, we just make your home healthier and more efficient from top to bottom. 
Here's a sampling of our services:   


Clockwise from top left: checking and installing water efficiency at the tap; testing appliances for energy use to show you how much you can save with simple behavioral changes; a sampling of the energy efficient lighting options we can install, cleaning condenser coils to maximize refrigerator efficiency; water efficiency for the toilet; and showing drivers how to drive more fuel-efficiently. Other services are more oriented toward ingredients in food and personal care products, and others, like cleaning out the dryer lint vent, are not only good for efficiency but make your home more fire safe, too!
We show up with the hardware and know-how to make your home greener, and we make it happen, right on the spot. In just a few hours, your home will be cleaner, healthier, and more efficient. In many of our initial house visits, the service has paid for itself by reducing utility bills in anywhere from 2-6 months, with nothing but savings thereafter for you and your family. Best yet, much of the installations we do you can take with you if you move, and much of what you can learn during those hours will save you money and reduce your exposure to toxic stuff for the rest of your life, no matter how many times you move. 

So whether you're homeowner or renter, the benefits are crystal clear!

<p>The world is moving into a period of widespread water stress and competition with <em>huge</em> implications for food security and ecological balance.  Now imagine—instead of giant water projects that devour energy reserves and irresponsibly batter water resources (think Three Gorges Dam), we pause, and figure out how small farmer-managed irrigation systems in places like Nepal have remained entirely self-reliant for thousands of years under stressor after stressor.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://versastudio.com/archives/nepal-indiegogo/nepalese-farmer-560px.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2>The Project   </h2>
<p>Hi, I’m Rachel Murray and in 2010, I decided to carry out my vision of finding smarter innovations for sustainable irrigation by entering a graduate program at the University of Wisconsin’s Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies (named after Gaylord Nelson, former Governor of Wisconsin and founder of Earth Day). </p>
<p>For the last two years I have formed collaborations with several major international organizations, the Nepal Department of Irrigation, and universities in the United States and Asia, to develop an integrated project to piece together the puzzle of how ancient small-scale farmer-managed irrigation systems in Nepal are adapting to the modern shocks that are threatening <em>all</em> water and crop systems in our world—climate change and the unintended effects of globalization. </p>
<p>Starting this July, 2013 through January, 2014, I will be living in the farming communities of three middle hills districts (Kaski, Palpa, and Syangja) in Nepal, collecting data on a wide range of variables in the physical and social sciences, to shed light on the web of complex mechanisms that form sustainable farmer-managed irrigation systems.  I will also be asking community members what challenges are the biggest barriers to their success, such as women's access to resources and decision-making power, to look towards future interventions that are fitted to each community's unique situation and sensitive to their actual needs.</p>
<p>This project will uncover what makes farmer-managed irrigation systems in South Asia resilient, flexible, and enduring because, after all, we will all have to move towards sustainable, regional innovations in food production and water security for ourselves, and for our children.</p>

<h2>How You Can Help Make This a Reality</h2>
<p>Your help can make this research project a success, and here’s how:  While the above organizations have generously offered assistance with office space, expert consultation, translators, field sites and data sharing, I need your help with technological funding.</p>
<p>Doing this project right requires recording hundreds of interviews; collecting and compiling 30 years of weather, crop, land use and ownership, and economic data; and recording, organizing and analyzing my own direct field observations about every facet of these irrigation systems.</p>
<p>I need your support to fund the following research equipment:</p>

<h3>How better research can help us avoid costly failures</h3>
<p><em>Irrigation development failures are almost always based on a faulty understanding of the problem's true nature.</em></p>
<p>An irrigation specialist once told me about a government irrigation project in Nepal that included installing a modern concrete head water structure to replace the one that the farmers maintained annually, assuming that this installation would increase productivity.</p>
<p>Later they were shocked to find out that agricultural productivity had actually <em>gone down</em>. The decrease in productivity was a result of the collapse of a complex internal hierarchy and the disintegration of the community structure wherein upper-end users made yearly agreements to provide tail-end users with water because the tail-end users provided maintenance throughout the year.</p>
<p>This maintenance was either not required with the new dam or the farmers felt no ownership over the infrastructure, their attitude being—<em>the government built it and it was their job to maintain it with their own money and materials</em>. This not only decreased the overall productivity of the local agroecosystem, but had the insidious effect of making the community less self-reliant and more dependent on the government.</p>
<p>To date, the developed world has spent substantially more on food aid to developing nations than it has spent on agricultural interventions to help these nations feed themselves. Research needs to find ways to empower  governments and citizens rather than ways to provide them mainly with food assistance.</p>
<p>While it is tempting to ignore the plight of those who seem so distant, globalization and climate change have made the world much smaller and entirely interdependent. This situation is not just a humanitarian disaster, but a threat to both democratic values and national interests.</p>

The world is moving into a period of widespread water stress and competition with huge implications for food security and ecological balance.  Now imagine—instead of giant water projects that devour energy reserves and irresponsibly batter water resources (think Three Gorges Dam), we pause, and figure out how small farmer-managed irrigation systems in places like Nepal have remained entirely self-reliant for thousands of years under stressor after stressor.

The Project   
Hi, I’m Rachel Murray and in 2010, I decided to carry out my vision of finding smarter innovations for sustainable irrigation by entering a graduate program at the University of Wisconsin’s Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies (named after Gaylord Nelson, former Governor of Wisconsin and founder of Earth Day). 
For the last two years I have formed collaborations with several major international organizations, the Nepal Department of Irrigation, and universities in the United States and Asia, to develop an integrated project to piece together the puzzle of how ancient small-scale farmer-managed irrigation systems in Nepal are adapting to the modern shocks that are threatening all water and crop systems in our world—climate change and the unintended effects of globalization. 
Starting this July, 2013 through January, 2014, I will be living in the farming communities of three middle hills districts (Kaski, Palpa, and Syangja) in Nepal, collecting data on a wide range of variables in the physical and social sciences, to shed light on the web of complex mechanisms that form sustainable farmer-managed irrigation systems.  I will also be asking community members what challenges are the biggest barriers to their success, such as women's access to resources and decision-making power, to look towards future interventions that are fitted to each community's unique situation and sensitive to their actual needs.
This project will uncover what makes farmer-managed irrigation systems in South Asia resilient, flexible, and enduring because, after all, we will all have to move towards sustainable, regional innovations in food production and water security for ourselves, and for our children.

How You Can Help Make This a Reality
Your help can make this research project a success, and here’s how:  While the above organizations have generously offered assistance with office space, expert consultation, translators, field sites and data sharing, I need your help with technological funding.
Doing this project right requires recording hundreds of interviews; collecting and compiling 30 years of weather, crop, land use and ownership, and economic data; and recording, organizing and analyzing my own direct field observations about every facet of these irrigation systems.
I need your support to fund the following research equipment:


A weather- and damage-resistant laptop for the field
Weather-proof recording equipment
Mobile field mapping and data collection software
A handheld GPS unit with high sensitivity and expandable storage
Solar chargers for the field
You can also help out by spreading the word about this campaign via emails, Facebook, Twitter, or your own blog, for any of your friends and family you think might be interested in investing in food and water security.

How better research can help us avoid costly failures
Irrigation development failures are almost always based on a faulty understanding of the problem's true nature.
An irrigation specialist once told me about a government irrigation project in Nepal that included installing a modern concrete head water structure to replace the one that the farmers maintained annually, assuming that this installation would increase productivity.
Later they were shocked to find out that agricultural productivity had actually gone down. The decrease in productivity was a result of the collapse of a complex internal hierarchy and the disintegration of the community structure wherein upper-end users made yearly agreements to provide tail-end users with water because the tail-end users provided maintenance throughout the year.
This maintenance was either not required with the new dam or the farmers felt no ownership over the infrastructure, their attitude being—the government built it and it was their job to maintain it with their own money and materials. This not only decreased the overall productivity of the local agroecosystem, but had the insidious effect of making the community less self-reliant and more dependent on the government.
To date, the developed world has spent substantially more on food aid to developing nations than it has spent on agricultural interventions to help these nations feed themselves. Research needs to find ways to empower  governments and citizens rather than ways to provide them mainly with food assistance.
While it is tempting to ignore the plight of those who seem so distant, globalization and climate change have made the world much smaller and entirely interdependent. This situation is not just a humanitarian disaster, but a threat to both democratic values and national interests.
Our futures are tied together with developing countries in a world facing formidable global challenges, including scarce natural resources and the effects of climate change amidst ever-growing populations.
Education and research must recognize that there is an obligation that comes with knowledge. With the knowledge gained from FMIS research such as mine, local, regional, and global agencies can prove effective leaders in sustainable crop production by recognizing that local users, under certain conditions, are able to offer better institutional solutions and enforce rules at lower cost. The key to global food and water security requires a new understanding of the ways in which these systems are adapting to social and environmental flux.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Erica Klopf and the Florida Gulf Coast University Food Forest </h3>
<p>In May of 2011, a group of passionate students, faculty, and staff at Florida Gulf Coast University launched a permaculture project on their campus called the FGCU Food Forest.  I was blessed with the opportunity to play a key role in the design and installation of this amazing project.  Since its inception, over 12,000 student-volunteer hours have been logged there on work days that are 100% student organized.  Thousands of pounds of food have been grown naturally and made available free to students 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  </p>
<p>I have been accepted to give a Lightning Talk about our project at the Permaculture Your Campus International Conference being held at the University of Amherst this June, and have received a full scholarship to attend the conference.  Now, I am asking for help to fund my travel costs to Massachusetts.  </p>
<p>This is important because it is an opportunity for the FGCU Food Forest project to be connected to the greater national and international network of permaculture projects on universities.  This network will support and expand the availability of permaculture projects on campuses and strengthen this movement.  With your help, the FGCU Food Forest and our our special subtropical region of Southern Florida will be represented on an international level and become a part of this network.  </p>

<b><h3>Our Response</h3></b> <p></p>During the November 2013 assessment trip, the EWB-SFP project team performed interviews and surveys, and realized that El Limon’s storage tank did not reach sufficient capacity for there to be enough head to reach many homes in the village.

After performing a feasibility study, a hybrid grid/solar powered solution was proposed because if the system were connected to the grid, then at night time the community could switch the pump on, and let the tank fill up so that in the morning there would be enough head to reach the homes at the extremities of the village.

Project Background El Limon is a farming community of over 60 families near the major town of Estelí, Nicaragua. 
In 2007 El Limon’s water committee was formed to manage the installation of the solar-powered water distribution system, and since the installation the water committee has monitored and operated the system, collected funds for maintenance, received complaints from the community, hired engineers to service the system, and administered the utility bills. When the existing system ceased to provide sufficient water to all members of the community, the water community initiated contact with the EWB-SFP team to identify potential solutions for this issue.
  

The Need  
A safe, dependable water supply is essential to the socio-economic development of an agrarian community, and before the installation of the solar-powered water pump river water was the primary water source for El Limon. River water is extremely contaminated with pesticides that leach in from nearby farms, and was used for bathing and laundry. 
El Limon had already stood out as a forward-thinking and engaged community that has provided neighboring communities with leader in sustainability. However, the existing system does not provide sufficient supply to all families in the community.

While I have some friends that will help with the build, many are too far to do that or can't afford the time but still want to pitch in somehow. I think this is a very weird but effective way of having you contribute and know exactly where your gift ends up.  Can I buy this myself? Yep..I HAVE TO! but if the the funds come from you and your name lives on with it, well, that's just a perk for me and my heart.<br/></p> <ul>

<li>The Nature's Head composting toilet cost, taxes &amp; shipping will be $1000. It's comes with great reviews and a friend has one on his boat that they sail with for 3 months at a time.

tiny house &amp; ways to make it more environmentally friendly. The perks will be similar in that your name will live on with the project component.</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Your contribution will make a statement. First, that you accept my choice and second, that composting toilets are cool.  Right now the majority of the population poops into clean, potable water. I'm opting out of that. Less flushing from me!<br/></p> <ul></ul>

</h3><p>Hi, we're Evan Granito and Kammer Offenhauser. We're activists. We're also permaculture designers, raisers of food, lovers of food, lovers of live music, and lovers of people.  We're human beings doing our best to play our parts in the evolution of how we relate to our environment, food and communities. We're teaming with world-renowned artist The Polish Ambassador to bring as much action to his stop in Michigan as possible and we need your support!

An oft repeated mantra of ""think globally, act locally"" embodies the energy, impact and magnitude of this campaign. This is a musical tour that celebrates and unites lovers of music and community change in a 30-city, two-day dance of music and local projects that get people working with the earth and their communities on various local community gardens, natural building projects and all manners of endeavors that weaves sustainability, political activism and world transformation. </p>
<p>This specific project is a co-created effort between Michigan organizers, the city of Kalamazoo and the incredible services of the Polish Ambassador's team. This project is to transform an underused public space in an underserved neighborhood in Kalamazoo. The project will demonstrate the beauty, function and sustainability of permaculture design with an edible landscape showcasing a bio-mimicked food forest. Layers of fruit and nut trees, nutrient-cycling support species, edible ground cover, aromatic and medicinal herbs cohabit with flowers harmonically supporting each other and the soil in an edible and educational symbiosis. Proper signage will create a lasting educational liaison for all who come and interact with this living, fruitful and abundant community hub. </p>

This budget will be used along with the physical contributions from supporting Michigan farmers, organizations and people who care about these kinds of passion projects coming into reality. Raising beyond $7,500 will allow us to provide more materials to site, permanent tools and facilities where we're building the garden and permaculture food forest system. Funds raised beyond the goal will also allow us to put more energy towards creating the permanent dedicated volunteer group to tend this system into its mature forest-like setting and creating partnerships with schools and youth programs, neighborhood groups and others that want to get active and expand this system. Funds will also help publicize this project in a way that will inspire other creatives, doers, community leaders and artists to follow suit, and spread this message further through learning materials, social media, publications, and artistic mediums. Documentation starting from this very Indiegogo campaign, to the organization of community groups representing generic outreach maps for communities across the country to replicate this project as a way to create public spaces that secure genetic diversity and heritage in a living, edible library and inherently contain the ability to propagate (multiply and expand) from the original donations gathered here by this campaign. Your donations expand the network of transformative work that is already being done across the country to redefine our world's relationship to their food and the growing process. Further financial support will funnel into future projects of the the The Polish Ambassador's nationally and globally expanding projects. </p>
<p><b>Impact and Magnitude</b></p><p>In a far-observing sense, your contributions go directly to the people it touches most often.  Volunteers can watch this plot of seedlings grow and expand as fruit trees mature, the forest grows in height and density, animals reclaim habitat in an edible ecosytem that values the exchanges of bacteria, fungus, trees, our flighted friends, woodland creatures and humans alike. Fruits of this project's labors become obvious to all who interact with it, play within it and grow up with a veritable Garden of Eden in their community. More importantly, Kalamazoo and Michigan garner national attention and traction in the local food movement and the Permaculture wave that is a design science permeating open minds globally. It offers itself as a documented replicable model that interacts with diverse social groups</p>

Funds will also help publicize this project in a way that will inspire other creatives, doers, community leaders and artists to follow suit, and spread this message further through learning materials, social media, publications, and artistic mediums. Documentation starting from this very Indiegogo campaign, to the organization of community groups representing generic outreach maps for communities across the country to replicate this project as a way to create public spaces that secure genetic diversity and heritage in a living, edible library and inherently contain the ability to propagate (multiply and expand) from the original donations gathered here by this campaign. Your donations expand the network of transformative work that is already being done across the country to redefine our world's relationship to their food and the growing process. Further financial support will funnel into future projects of the the The Polish Ambassador's nationally and globally expanding projects. 
Impact and MagnitudeIn a far-observing sense, your contributions go directly to the people it touches most often.  Volunteers can watch this plot of seedlings grow and expand as fruit trees mature, the forest grows in height and density, animals reclaim habitat in an edible ecosytem that values the exchanges of bacteria, fungus, trees, our flighted friends, woodland creatures and humans alike. Fruits of this project's labors become obvious to all who interact with it, play within it and grow up with a veritable Garden of Eden in their community. More importantly, Kalamazoo and Michigan garner national attention and traction in the local food movement and the Permaculture wave that is a design science permeating open minds globally. It offers itself as a documented replicable model that interacts with diverse social groups

<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>We are a group of 4 young men that have been in Bali, Indonesia since our childhood. Being aware of the local waste situation we have come up with an idea that we believe can make a difference. </p>
<p>We believe that Indonesia is so full of creative potential that can make a difference and that empowerment is needed. Our idea is to create a machine that lets communities take on the plastic waste problem themselves. It is a single building block to a comprehensive problem. <br/></p>
<p>We discovered the machine in Denpasar Bali, it was invented by Ida Bagus Ketut Atmaja. Pak Aji as he likes to be called created a backyard plastic distillation that converts plastics back into fuel. The fuel then burns up to 70 times cleaner than open fire burning of 
plastic and we believe it can used for tractors, generators, farming 
appliances and other machinery. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/973032/files/20141030184215-Pak_Aji_s_machine.jpg?1414719735"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>Immage above: Pak Aji's plastic to fuel machine. It has many safety hazards and design problems.</i><br/></p>
<p>Our goal is to take Pak Aji´s invention and to increase its potential, viability, safety and effectiveness. The device can be built for about 500 USD and it has the potential to create 1 L of fuel from a little more than 1 Kg of plastic waste. <br/>If every town had one of these machines, people would no longer be throwing their plastic away into the environment. <br/></p>
<p>We are asking for funding to build a safe plastic to fuel machine and research and discover the hidden details 
and make a first complete overview of the real potential of such a machine in Bali.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We wish to make this machine an open source project. This means that all our materials, designs, and steps will be documented and assembled into a manual for anyone to build the machine themselves. All parts will be locally sourced and easy to obtain. This will allow any village in Indonesia to raise the money needed to build the machine (roughly 500 USD) and build their very own plastic to fuel machine. The machine can be run by the village or a local activist. <br/></p>

<i>Image above: The beginnings of plastic to fuel machine, design version 5.0</i><br/><br/><p>Right now we are asking for funding to build this machine and tinker with it. The next step will be to analyze the fuel and come up with viable and safe use for it. We are already in the process of involving universities to help with the analysis. A private research university in Germany, Jacobs University Bremen, where Maitri Fischer, one of our team members studied, has all the equipment and expertise to analyze the fuel and help research a potential use. They have agreed to help and are waiting for our proposal. <br/></p>
<p>This project has immense potential to better one of the most serious environmental issues Bali has - waste disposal. Something like 40 percent (if not more) of trash generated by households ends up in the environment - rivers, ravines, rice fields, mangrove forests, construction sites etc. Although a lot of plastic is recycled by the ""pemulung"" a significant portion is left behind. With this machine we have the ability to take that plastic that is not being recycled to recycle and reuse it. </p>
<p>Our dream is to give plastic value and that people will start saving their plastic and recycling it by bringing it to their village collection points for a monetary return or for fuel. This will significantly reduce the amount of plastic entering the environment. <br/></p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need <br/>
</h3> <p>We believe we need a total of 1000 USD for materials to build version 5.0 of the plastic to fuel machine. The end product should be a machine that can be built with 500 to 600 USD, but we need a bit more money to tinker and upgrade parts as we progress as well as install pressure sensors and temperature gauges to keep the machine safe. Leftover funds if there are any will go into shipping cost of fuel samples, analyzing the fuel and experiments. <br/></p>We are not profiting from this in any way. We have already started buying materials with our own money. We are committed to see this project through. <br/><br/>We want to remain completely transparent throughout this project so we will post all receipts in the photo gallery and give continuous updates. We are accountable to all our donors, you can come bye and see everything for yourself whenever you want. <br/><br/>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>We have received a lot of input already from FB groups and a lot of people are concerned with the quality of fuel produced by this machine. <br/><br/>Our first step is to make a safe and operable machine. The next stage will be to analyze the fuel and find a safe and reliable use for it. This is not the first time someone is doing plastic pyrolysis - converting plastic to fuel.

Hi, we are Momoko Kobayashi and Tomoko Mitsuya and both live in Japan. 


We are  volunteers at OrcaLab (www.orcalab.org; www.orca-live.net/community) which is known internationally as an orca research station located on Hanson Island in British Columbia, Canada. We keep going back to OrcaLab every summer to help Dr. Paul Spong and Helena Symonds. The summer is the busiest season because the orcas known as Northern residents come back to the area from the north. OrcaLab has a hydrophone network that allows us to keep track of the orcas in the area without chasing them. The most important work the volunteers do is the recording of the orcas calls. The recording needs some technique and training, so we teach the new volunteers at the beginning of the summer. It will be the 17th summer that Tomoko has been to Orcalab and 6th for Momoko.

For the rest of the year, we work as part-timers to earn money to travel to Canada. It's getting more difficult to get enough money to travel because of the economy situation in Japan and the depreciation of JPY.  So we would like you to help us continue volunteering by helping with our plane and bus tickets and the groceries for the stay. It will be a great help. We love orcas, nature, Paul and Helena. Please let us keep helping them!

</div></span></h3></div></div>","The Goal 
My name is Emily Hunter, I am a young environmental activist that is fundraising to join her next campaign. DeforestAction: Project Borneo is a global action campaign driven by young people to helprestore the Borneo rainforest, save Orangutans and build a sustainable local economy. 

The project is led by acclaimed conservationist Dr. Willie Smits and Orangutan Outreach. If I achieve my fundraising goal, I will get the opportunity to participate in DeforestAction on the ground in Indonesia later this summer!

I have already raised $5,000 to sponsor 2,500 square meters of land to be protected for 100 years in Borneo. My next goal is to raise $2,000 to send me to join DeforestACTION. All proceeds raised go directly to airfare and the necessary gear I will need. Please help send me to Borneo so I can help make a difference!



The Activist

Over the last eight years, Emily Hunter has been an environmental activist tackling global crises. Emily is the daughter of Greenpeace's founding president, Robert Hunter, and first women to save a whale, Bobbi Hunter. 

Emily herself has worked on numerous environmental campaigns: She has battled on the high seas of Antarctica to save whales with Sea Shepherd; she was taken hostage in her attempt to protect the Galapagos Islands from illegal poaching; put a spotlight on the Canadian tar sands (the second largest oil project next to Saudi Arabia) with a TV documentary; stood on the protest front-lines at the Copenhagen climate summit;  and recently published her first book called The Next Eco-Warriors, a collection of short stories by the next generation of eco-activists. 

Currently, she works as a freelance reporter for IMPACT, a TV-documentary series on MTV News Canada, covering environmental and social justice issues that affect generation Y. DeforestACTION is all her passions in one - climate justice, animal rights and media as a tool for change! 


The Impact
The forest of the world are disappearing fast. If we don't do something soon, they will be destroyed, taking away the habitat of orangtuans and advancing climate change. 


In Indonesia alone, a forest the size of 300 football fields is being cut down every hour - to make way for palm oil plantations (product used in cooking oils, cosmetics, cleaning products & biofuelds). Currently, half of the annual global tropical timber comes from Borneo. Some estimate, the Borneo rainforest (the oldest rainforest on Earth) will be gone in a matter of a few decades. 

Deforestation accounts for roughly a quarter of all greenhouse gas emisions, according the United Nations. Stopping deforestation is an urgent priority to ensure life on this planet can continue.

</tbody></table><p> <strong><em>Project Polar Bear</em></strong>: <strong>Helping To Preserve Sensitive Arctic Environments Using Innovative, Award-Winning Green Technology</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each year</strong>, thousands of new oil wells are drilled in environmentally sensitive areas. When these wells are finished, a gasoline or diesel generator is installed to provide electrical power to instruments monitoring pressure, flow and other parameters in the completed well. These generators run continuously for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year – and each generator dumps about 2 pounds of carbon into the environment <em>for every gallon of gasoline or diesel that they consume</em>. With close to 50,000 remote wells being finished per year in environmentally sensitive areas in Canada, United States and Russia, there are millions pounds of carbon poured into the atmosphere with each day that they operate, and that amount is produced every hour of every day, all year long.</p>
<p><strong>Well drillers</strong> and operators have tried to find alternatives to this wholesale dump of harmful greenhouse gases into the atmosphere – but Arctic conditions are some of the most extreme of environments on Earth. Well operators have few choices when it comes to producing electric power for their completed wells. They’ve tried solar cells, but with the sunshine almost non-existent for months during the winter, not much power can be produced. What little can be produced must be stored to batteries, and the cold freezes these batteries and renders them useless.  Another “green” technology is the use of windmills, but during winter months, there is either too little wind or too much wind – but rarely is there “just the right amount” to produce power for the completed well. Of course, windmills must also store their power to batteries, and batteries don’t survive Arctic winters. When a battery freezes and cracks, it spills acids and harmful chemicals into the environment, and causes irreparable damage to the sensitive ecosystem beneath the generator. Finally, fuel cells have been tried, but fuel cells, while being extremely expensive are also extremely sensitive to low temperatures – and during the winter, it’s not unusual to see -60°F (-51°C) – far below where fuel cells operate efficiently (or at all). Unfortunately, oil well operators must rely on gasoline and diesel engine power generators - and because of the harsh environment, they must also maintain them regularly because of the effects of the harsh winter on piston motors. With gas or diesel generators, there’s always the danger of a spill of oil, gasoline, diesel or coolant into the environment, making their widespread use that much more damaging.</p>
<p><strong>Nitro-Turbodyne</strong> has created an alternative to these gross polluters with its Remote Instrumentation Power Generation Unit (RIPGU). The RIPGU uses a patented, revolutionary device known as a Micro Flash-Expansion Turbine (MFET) as the power generator. </p>

</tbody></table><p>The MFET has only 1 moving part and is maintenance-free, so it doesn’t use grease or oil for lubrication like a piston motor does, nor does it require any coolant…because it doesn’t burn any fuel at all. Instead, the MFET direct-injects, then flash-expands Liquid Nitrogen (LN<sub>2</sub>) within the turbine itself. LN<sub>2</sub> flash-expands to 696 times its volume from liquid to gas. The turbine works this way: if the MFET pulls in 696 cubic inches of air and direct-injects 1 cubic inch of LN<sub>2</sub>, once the LN<sub>2</sub> expands, you will get a total of almost 1400 cubic inches of gas coming out of the back of the little turbine at higher speed and pressure than the air that it took in. LN<sub>2</sub> is used because it is made from the air that we breathe – since our air is almost 80% nitrogen, LN<sub>2</sub> can be made inexpensively and is 100% renewable. No one controls the stock of air that we breathe, so the fuel price can only go down as competition to produce it goes up. LN<sub>2</sub> is also very common and available in large quantities at oil well sites, and is used to “finish” an oil well as it is completed.  LN<sub>2</sub> is commonly available for about $0.09 per liter (or about $0.34 per gallon). Best of all, since it’s made from air, once it’s flash-expanded in the MFET, it’s returned to the air without any combustion, oxidation or heat. Since there is no heat produced, it doesn’t produce greenhouse gases, carbon-laden by-products or anything that harms the environment. It’s a perfect fuel – inexpensive, renewable, and absolutely NO emission of greenhouse gases…or any other chemical that can harm life in an environmentally sensitive area.</p>
<p><strong>Using LN<sub>2</sub></strong> is a perfect fuel for sensitive environments - since there is no combustion of volatile fuels or gases, the MFET operates quietly, continuously and efficiently – and without damaging the environment or harming an already threatened ecosystem. Your contribution to this Indiegogo project not only helps the environment in a very big way, but it also helps to further research and development into the use of the MFET for power generation and other applications. Better yet - you get some pretty cool swag for helping to save the Arctic, too.</p>
<p><strong><em>What’s Project Polar Bear’s Goal?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Our goal</strong> is to eventually replace each and every gasoline and diesel power generator in the Arctic. Since we can’t gain acceptance from all users immediately, we’ll starting by replacing 12 generators in 12 locations above the Arctic Circle – at completed wells – for the duration of an entire winter (typically September through April) - the most extreme weather condition for any generator. We’ll use these 12 units to demonstrate and prove the ability of the RIPGU to operate without carbon emissions, noxious gases, harmful fuels and excess heat – as well as the RIPGUs ability to provide clean, renewable power generation for months at a time without the need for maintenance or without harming the delicate environment or ecosystem of the Arctic.</p>

</tbody></table><p><strong>The technology</strong> behind the MFET has won 2 international awards in clean tech competitions; we’ve demonstrated that we can produce clean, maintenance free and quiet electrical power that will revolutionize the renewable energy field. Based on data gathered from the operation of the MFET, improvements are continually being made to increase its efficiency and to allow it to be operated in the harshest of environments.</p>
<p><strong>During the </strong>time that they’re in operation, each unit will be monitored continuously for LN<sub>2</sub> consumption, oxygen levels, power output, temperature inside and outside the RIPGU, vibration, and other parameters that will be used to demonstrate the RIPGU as a clean and environmentally sound alternative to gasoline or diesel power generators. That data that we gather will also be used in the design of future MFET applications such as power generation for remote villages in undeveloped and under-developed countries, transportation and other applications where low-cost, quiet, renewable and environmentally friendly electricity is needed.</p>
<p><strong>We currently</strong> have interest from several oil companies and operators of well sites and geophysical observation stations that are willing to deploy RIPGU in environmentally sensitive areas. We have executed an agreement with a consortium of universities to test two of our units for their possible use in geophysical observatories. Operation of the RIPGUs in a harsh Arctic environment will prove that replacing polluting, hot, maintenance intensive gasoline or diesel generators will be not only possible, but will allow operators of remote wells and observation stations to reduce their carbon footprint to zero, as well as remove heat and greenhouse gases from their production sites. Because RIPGUs simple, inexpensive and durable, we know that they will be adopted for widespread use to supply electrical power at most remote well sites and geophysical observatories throughout the world. Once in full production, RIPGUs will cost about $2000 per unit - about the same cost as the current gasoline or diesel generators that are in use, but with none of the pollution or harm to the environment.</p>
<p><strong>With climate</strong> change having the most profound effect on the Arctic regions, it’s a logical place to start healing the environment by removing gross-polluting sources such as gasoline and diesel power generators at remote well sites. You can make a profound difference with your Indiegogo contribution -- and help to prove there is an alternative to polluting our pristine Arctic wilderness.</p>
<p><strong><em>What’s Project Polar Bear’s Budget?</em></strong></p>
<p>We are looking for a total of $76,000</p>
<ul>
<li>$10,640 in fees collected by Indiegogo (9%) and Paypal (5%)</li>
<li>$29,800 will be used for materials, sensors and electronics for producing 12 RIPGUs</li>
<li>$7,520 will be used to build re-useable, carbon-neutral and green manufacturing fixtures for future RIPGU production. These fixtures will also be used to produce future RIPGUs.</li>
<li>$3,280 will be used to obtain outside machine-shop services for completing 12 RIPGU enclosures</li>
<li>$5,180 will be used to obtain operating permits to operate the RIPGUs from the United States</li>
<li>$9,480 will be used to provide shipping of the 12 units to Pt. Barrow, Alaska or Paulatuk, Northern Territories, Canada</li>
<li>$10,100 will be used to provide travel for our Engineers to support on-going Project Polar Bear operations during the winter deployment</li>
</ul><p><strong>For every</strong> $2,000 we raise above the requested amount, we’ll build another RIPGU and deploy it into the field – to help further reduce the amount of carbon that gasoline and diesel generators dump into our atmosphere.</p>

The technology behind the MFET has won 2 international awards in clean tech competitions; we’ve demonstrated that we can produce clean, maintenance free and quiet electrical power that will revolutionize the renewable energy field. Based on data gathered from the operation of the MFET, improvements are continually being made to increase its efficiency and to allow it to be operated in the harshest of environments.
During the time that they’re in operation, each unit will be monitored continuously for LN2 consumption, oxygen levels, power output, temperature inside and outside the RIPGU, vibration, and other parameters that will be used to demonstrate the RIPGU as a clean and environmentally sound alternative to gasoline or diesel power generators. That data that we gather will also be used in the design of future MFET applications such as power generation for remote villages in undeveloped and under-developed countries, transportation and other applications where low-cost, quiet, renewable and environmentally friendly electricity is needed.
We currently have interest from several oil companies and operators of well sites and geophysical observation stations that are willing to deploy RIPGU in environmentally sensitive areas. We have executed an agreement with a consortium of universities to test two of our units for their possible use in geophysical observatories. Operation of the RIPGUs in a harsh Arctic environment will prove that replacing polluting, hot, maintenance intensive gasoline or diesel generators will be not only possible, but will allow operators of remote wells and observation stations to reduce their carbon footprint to zero, as well as remove heat and greenhouse gases from their production sites. Because RIPGUs simple, inexpensive and durable, we know that they will be adopted for widespread use to supply electrical power at most remote well sites and geophysical observatories throughout the world. Once in full production, RIPGUs will cost about $2000 per unit - about the same cost as the current gasoline or diesel generators that are in use, but with none of the pollution or harm to the environment.
With climate change having the most profound effect on the Arctic regions, it’s a logical place to start healing the environment by removing gross-polluting sources such as gasoline and diesel power generators at remote well sites. You can make a profound difference with your Indiegogo contribution -- and help to prove there is an alternative to polluting our pristine Arctic wilderness.
What’s Project Polar Bear’s Budget?
We are looking for a total of $76,000

$10,640 in fees collected by Indiegogo (9%) and Paypal (5%)
$29,800 will be used for materials, sensors and electronics for producing 12 RIPGUs
$7,520 will be used to build re-useable, carbon-neutral and green manufacturing fixtures for future RIPGU production. These fixtures will also be used to produce future RIPGUs.
$3,280 will be used to obtain outside machine-shop services for completing 12 RIPGU enclosures
$5,180 will be used to obtain operating permits to operate the RIPGUs from the United States
$9,480 will be used to provide shipping of the 12 units to Pt. Barrow, Alaska or Paulatuk, Northern Territories, Canada
$10,100 will be used to provide travel for our Engineers to support on-going Project Polar Bear operations during the winter deployment
For every $2,000 we raise above the requested amount, we’ll build another RIPGU and deploy it into the field – to help further reduce the amount of carbon that gasoline and diesel generators dump into our atmosphere.

Help us reach them.Last December we raised $8,602 to publish our independent analysis of the risks of Northern Gateway. We built a website, published reports, and developed infographics and animations to explain our arguments.Now we need to make sure this content is seen, and not just by people who are already engaged. We plan to buy advertising to promote our message, to ensure that it reaches a broader audience that might not otherwise be exposed to this issue.What we do: Concerned Professional Engineers independently investigates the engineering aspects of megaprojects like the Northern Gateway pipeline.  
Picking up where the regulatory process leaves off: scientific analysis of megaprojects.
The National Energy Board's Joint Review Panel (NEB JRP) was supposed to conduct an independent, thorough, and science-based investigation of the Northern Gateway Project. We participated in the official JRP process and tried to get answers to our many questions and concerns from Enbridge and their consultants. No answers were provided and we were again disappointed when the Joint Review Panel released their report with its 209 conditions.There are many, many areas where critical risk factors are not justified and are backed up merely with assumptions. The Joint Review Panel, despite it's mandate, was comfortable with trusting the assumptions of Northern Gateway and their consultants. We weren't. That's why we started CPE, and that's why, in December 2013, we raised $8,602 to build our website and start publishing infographics and animations explaining the issues.Our goal: stop preaching to the choirNow we want to take the next step.  We want to reach people who are outside of our social network, who are outside of your social network, and who wouldn't otherwise be exposed to information from the other side of the argument.  We want to reach people who, for whatever reason, are either unaware of the risks posed by this project, who presume the regulators must be doing a sufficient job, who have only been exposed to advertising by Enbridge, or those who are just too busy to research the issue on their own.Why we need money: advertisingTo date we have relied only on organic (unpaid) growth to spread our message.  While we would prefer to continue with organic growth only, we understand that social networks often follow political and ideological lines, and organic growth among people who support our message will only go so far.  So how can we reach our target audience?We believe the best way to do this is through advertising, and advertising costs money.  We plan to use the funds raised to promote our message on social and other media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube.We also need to continue generating content that makes the details of our analysis accessible to a broader audience.  And we need to generate new content to keep up with developments, as they occur. How we'll spend the moneyAdvertising: we plan to purchase advertising and promotion on a number of social and other media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.  Depending on how much we raise, we may also try to purchase radio advertising.New media: we've received great feedback on the content we've generated so far and we'd like to create more, both for existing arguments and in response to developments as they occur.In order to achieve our goals, we are hiring local (British Columbian) web and social media talent.  We believe in paying these people a fair wage for their excellent work, and that's why we're asking for your support.About our group

<h3>The Fighting Goliath story</h3>
<p>
The goal of this campaign is to protect the beautiful
Lochsa and Clearwater rivers of north central Idaho from the oil industry and tar
sands-bound “megaload” traffic on U.S. Highway 12. These two rivers were among
the first protected by the federal Wild &amp; Scenic Rivers Act in 1968. </p>
<p>The outcome of this campaign will have profound
impacts on the future of these watersheds, and on the management of Wild &amp;
Scenic Rivers across the U.S.<br/></p>

them are threatened today by an oil industry fixated on transforming U.S.
Highway 12 (a winding, two-lane road that runs along and through the river <span>canyons) into a
permanent ‘high and wide’ transportation route for space shuttle-sized,
road-closing, recreation-stopping, scenery-destroying megaloads of mining
equipment. The industry hopes to transport these loads from ports on the Snake
River near Lewiston, Idaho, overland to the Canadian tar sands mines and other
fossil fuel hotbeds east of the Rockies.</span><p></p>
<p>Among our nation’s
natural treasures, the Lochsa and Clearwater rivers are real gems. They boast
crystal clear waters, towering cedars, steep canyon walls and moss-covered
rocks. In
addition to their beauty, the rivers are significant nationally because: </p>

<li>They are home to important populations of
     native westslope cutthroat trout, bull trout, elk, bears, wolves, nesting harlequin ducks and songbirds.</li>
<li>They are rich in history — the river
     canyons provided travel corridors for the Nez Perce Indians for centuries,
     and for the Lewis and Clark expedition in 1805.</li>

values — and the health and integrity of America's entire Wild &amp; Scenic
River system. If we lose the Lochsa and Clearwater, which river is next? If we
lose the Lochsa and Clearwater, what does Wild and Scenic mean for other
protected rivers?<p></p>
<p>Together, we can
convince the U.S. Forest Service to implement permanent protections for two of
America’s original Wild &amp; Scenic Rivers. With your help, we can stop big oil from converting these gems into an industrial shipping route for the tar
sands mines.</p>

<h3>About the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968</h3>
<p></p>

<p><img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/813129/files/20140826070558-Lochsa_01_KL_smaller.jpg?1409061958"" src="""" style=""""/></p>The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson in October 1968. The intent of the Act was to protect rivers in their free-flowing state, and to prevent the degradation of natural, scenic, recreational, cultural, historic and other values identified at the time of designation. The Lochsa and Middle Fork of the Clearwater (along with their
sister river, the Selway) were among the first eight designations under the
Act.</div><div>
<p>Today, the National System
protects 12,598 miles of 203 rivers in 38 states and the Commonwealth of Puerto
Rico; this is less than one-quarter of one percent of the nation's rivers. By
comparison, more than 75,000 large dams across the country have modified at
least 600,000 miles, or about 17%, of American rivers.</p>
<p>The U.S. Forest
Service has the authority and the responsibility to protect the Lochsa and
Clearwater Wild &amp; Scenic Rivers. The agency’s refusal so far to ban
megaloads from the protected river corridor has put the integrity of the entire
Wild &amp; Scenic Rivers System in jeopardy. </p>

their quest to turn the Clearwater-Lochsa Wild &amp; Scenic River corridor into
a permanent, “high and wide” transportation route for tar sands bound 'megaloads'
in 2008. Originally, much of the super-sized equipment was to be manufactured
in Asia, shipped to Snake River ports and then overland through our river
corridors enroute to Alberta’s tar sands.<br/><p></p>
<p>Engulfing both lanes of winding, rural U.S.
Highway 12, megaloads stand up to three stories tall, 30-feet wide, are longer
than a football field and weigh up to 1 million pounds. With hopes of moving
hundreds of megaloads through the Cleawater-Lochsa river canyons, a steady
stream of megaloads and their convoys would pose safety hazards for residents
and travelers, block access for recreation, disrupt wildlife, and destroy the rivers
aesthetic, spiritual and cultural values.</p>
<p>Megaloads have no place in America’s Wild &amp;
Scenic River corridors.</p>

‘megaload’ battle since 2010. In 2012, our group and our allies, including the
Nez Perce Tribe, filed a lawsuit to stop Canada’s Imperial Oil (an Exxon-Mobil subsidiary)
from using the rivers for hundreds of loads. Favoring IRU’s position, the court
placed megaload-regulating authority in the hands of the Forest Service. Sadly,
in August 2013 another megaload — this one owned by General Electric and bound
for the tar sands — traveled through the river corridors. Despite protests by
the Nez Perce Tribe and IRU members, the Forest Service took no action to stop the
loads.<p></p>
<p>IRU and the Tribe went back to federal court and
obtained an injunction blocking megaload traffic until permanent rules and restrictions
can be developed and put in place. In August 2014 our organization, the Tribe
and the USFS began court-supervised mediation to attempt to resolve the issues.</p>
<p>That means our work to win permanent protections
is just beginning.</p>
<p>Mediation with the Forest Service will require
considerable manpower, grassroots organizing, media work, travel and direct
advocacy. We must make sure the Forest Service writes acceptable, legal and
protective transportation regulations for the Wild &amp; Scenic corridor and
Nez Perce homeland. That won't be easy. So far the agency has seemed reluctant to buck big oil.</p>

</div></div>","We're humbled and grateful here at Idaho Rivers United for the outpouring of support we received during our Indiegogo campaign, which concluded September 25, 2014. More than 200 of you helped exceed our $25,000 goal and raised $27,600 to fight industrialization of the Lochsa and Clearwater rivers, and Wild and Scenic Rivers across America.
From the bottom of our free-flowing rivers, thank you!
If you're new to this issue, please read on to learn about big oil's attempts to turn two of America's original Wild and Scenic rivers into industrial thoroughfares. This work is ongoing, and you can still donate to Idaho Rivers United at idahorivers.org.

The Fighting Goliath story

The goal of this campaign is to protect the beautiful
Lochsa and Clearwater rivers of north central Idaho from the oil industry and tar
sands-bound “megaload” traffic on U.S. Highway 12. These two rivers were among
the first protected by the federal Wild & Scenic Rivers Act in 1968. 
The outcome of this campaign will have profound
impacts on the future of these watersheds, and on the management of Wild &
Scenic Rivers across the U.S.


The Clearwater, Lochsa and the landscapes around
them are threatened today by an oil industry fixated on transforming U.S.
Highway 12 (a winding, two-lane road that runs along and through the river canyons) into a
permanent ‘high and wide’ transportation route for space shuttle-sized,
road-closing, recreation-stopping, scenery-destroying megaloads of mining
equipment. The industry hopes to transport these loads from ports on the Snake
River near Lewiston, Idaho, overland to the Canadian tar sands mines and other
fossil fuel hotbeds east of the Rockies.
Among our nation’s
natural treasures, the Lochsa and Clearwater rivers are real gems. They boast
crystal clear waters, towering cedars, steep canyon walls and moss-covered
rocks. In
addition to their beauty, the rivers are significant nationally because: 


They offer world-class destinations for
     whitewater boaters, anglers, hikers, bikers, campers, backpackers,
     skiers, wildlife watchers and hunters.
They provide critical habitat for
     federally protected salmon and wild steelhead.
They are home to important populations of
     native westslope cutthroat trout, bull trout, elk, bears, wolves, nesting harlequin ducks and songbirds.
They are rich in history — the river
     canyons provided travel corridors for the Nez Perce Indians for centuries,
     and for the Lewis and Clark expedition in 1805.
They lie at the heart of the Nez Perce
     homeland and include sacred tribal sites.


Megaloads threaten those
values — and the health and integrity of America's entire Wild & Scenic
River system. If we lose the Lochsa and Clearwater, which river is next? If we
lose the Lochsa and Clearwater, what does Wild and Scenic mean for other
protected rivers?
Together, we can
convince the U.S. Forest Service to implement permanent protections for two of
America’s original Wild & Scenic Rivers. With your help, we can stop big oil from converting these gems into an industrial shipping route for the tar
sands mines.

video, and please support this important campaign today!
  IRU is Idaho's only river-specific conservation group 


Idaho
Rivers United is a result-driven, campaign-oriented, non-profit conservation
group formed in 1990 to help citizens defend the rivers they love. Since that
time we’ve stopped construction of over 18 unnecessary and destructive dams,
led grassroots campaigns to protect and designate federal Wild & Scenic
Rivers, and have been a driving force in the national campaign to save Columbia
and Snake River salmon from extinction. Today, IRU has 3,500 members, 14 active
volunteer directors, and a staff of four full-time and three half-time river
activists. Our annual budget is small, but diverse, including some foundation
funding, member and individual contributions, business support and income from
events, such as chartered river trips. IRU’s
mission is to protect and restore the rivers of Idaho. We achieve our
goals using a mix of direct advocacy, education, grassroots organizing and
citizen involvement, collaboration and, when necessary, litigation. Learn more
at www.idahorivers.org.
About the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968


The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson in October 1968. The intent of the Act was to protect rivers in their free-flowing state, and to prevent the degradation of natural, scenic, recreational, cultural, historic and other values identified at the time of designation. The Lochsa and Middle Fork of the Clearwater (along with their
sister river, the Selway) were among the first eight designations under the
Act.
Today, the National System
protects 12,598 miles of 203 rivers in 38 states and the Commonwealth of Puerto
Rico; this is less than one-quarter of one percent of the nation's rivers. By
comparison, more than 75,000 large dams across the country have modified at
least 600,000 miles, or about 17%, of American rivers.
The U.S. Forest
Service has the authority and the responsibility to protect the Lochsa and
Clearwater Wild & Scenic Rivers. The agency’s refusal so far to ban
megaloads from the protected river corridor has put the integrity of the entire
Wild & Scenic Rivers System in jeopardy. 

Campaign Background



The oil industry and their contractors began
their quest to turn the Clearwater-Lochsa Wild & Scenic River corridor into
a permanent, “high and wide” transportation route for tar sands bound 'megaloads'
in 2008. Originally, much of the super-sized equipment was to be manufactured
in Asia, shipped to Snake River ports and then overland through our river
corridors enroute to Alberta’s tar sands.
Engulfing both lanes of winding, rural U.S.
Highway 12, megaloads stand up to three stories tall, 30-feet wide, are longer
than a football field and weigh up to 1 million pounds. With hopes of moving
hundreds of megaloads through the Cleawater-Lochsa river canyons, a steady
stream of megaloads and their convoys would pose safety hazards for residents
and travelers, block access for recreation, disrupt wildlife, and destroy the rivers
aesthetic, spiritual and cultural values.
Megaloads have no place in America’s Wild &
Scenic River corridors.

Idaho Rivers United has been fighting the
‘megaload’ battle since 2010. In 2012, our group and our allies, including the
Nez Perce Tribe, filed a lawsuit to stop Canada’s Imperial Oil (an Exxon-Mobil subsidiary)
from using the rivers for hundreds of loads. Favoring IRU’s position, the court
placed megaload-regulating authority in the hands of the Forest Service. Sadly,
in August 2013 another megaload — this one owned by General Electric and bound
for the tar sands — traveled through the river corridors. Despite protests by
the Nez Perce Tribe and IRU members, the Forest Service took no action to stop the
loads.
IRU and the Tribe went back to federal court and
obtained an injunction blocking megaload traffic until permanent rules and restrictions
can be developed and put in place. In August 2014 our organization, the Tribe
and the USFS began court-supervised mediation to attempt to resolve the issues.
That means our work to win permanent protections
is just beginning.
Mediation with the Forest Service will require
considerable manpower, grassroots organizing, media work, travel and direct
advocacy. We must make sure the Forest Service writes acceptable, legal and
protective transportation regulations for the Wild & Scenic corridor and
Nez Perce homeland. That won't be easy. So far the agency has seemed reluctant to buck big oil.
What We Need and What You Get

Since 2010, this
campaign has put significant stress on our small non-profit’s annual budget.
Big oil and the U.S. Forest Service don’t face such financial constraints. That’s why we’re reaching out to you via Indiegogo. Short term we need $25,000 to keep our campaign running effectively. We’ll use your contribution help us: 



Continue to build grassroots support for Wild & Scenic River
protection — in the Clearwater-Lochsa region and across Idaho.


Tell this story nationally with an eye toward convincing the government to
do the right thing for the Lochsa-Clearwater, and Wild & Scenic Rivers
nationwide.


And, engage fully and effectively in court-supervised mediation
with the Forest Service in an attempt to resolve our differences over the
management of the Lochsa-Clearwater Wild & Scenic corridor.


As an incentive to secure
your support, key business partners from the Lochsa-Clearwater region have
offered several incredible perks for our donors. Check out the list at the side
of this page!
Other Ways You Can Help
In addition to making a financial contribution to our campaign, there are other ways that you can help:

Please write an email to Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell (ttidwell@fs.fed.us) and tell him 1) it's the Forest Service's responsibility to protect America's first Wild & Scenic Rivers, 2) the Lochsa-Clearwater is too precious for big oil and 3) failing to act will threaten Wild & Scenic Rivers across the nation.

Also, share this campaign with your family and friends. We're working with our valued partners to engage river lovers around the nation, but a campaign like this is most effective when people like you spread the word. Please pass it along via email or via social media, and help us keep the Lochsa and Clearwater rivers megaload free for generations to come.

He had a way of touching the hearts of the audiences that he spoke to. The wild animals and the Bushmen were always part of his story.

The birth of wildlife sanctuaries such as Shamwari and Sanbona, created through the genius and hard work of Adrian Gardiner in the Eastern Cape have proved that wildlife conservation has been a tremendous boon, not only to the conservation of animals, but also to the tourist industry which I <span style=""line-height: 1.45em; letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">believe will eventually prove its critical importance to South Africa because it is sustainable, unlike the minerals which will eventually run out.

And after Dutch colonization in the year 1652 the Cape was never to be the same again!   However, the real Africa is a land of innovation, optimism and restoration! After much environmental and socio-political unrest, as various cultures surpassed their predecessors and came to define their own borders within this multi-cultural blend, the Cape was left in a state of wildlife neutrality! Vast Karoo plains devoid of springbok, blesbok, black wildebeest and quagga; Fynbos laden mountains devoid of red hartebeest, eland and elephant; and water courses devoid of hippopotamus. But the modern African was not satisfied to have African bush devoid of African wildlife, and so we embark on the quest to ‘rewild’ this forgotten wilderness!   ""Rewilding The Lost Wilderness: Green Heritage of the Forgotten Cape"" is the story of a quintessential African wilderness that has been lost and is being regained! It is a story of hope and restoration! A tale of hope for all the wilderness areas that has been lost, and an example for all wilderness areas that is still to be regained!~ Marcel H. van der Merwe""a South African author, conservation activist, and philanthropist.""THE MISSION       ""I read Marcel van der Merwe’s book with great interest and empathy, his authors note really says it all and he is to be complimented on producing an outstanding contribution to conservation literature. Sixty two years of my life has now been spent in the battle for the conservation of wildlife and wilderness in South Africa, also in other countries such as the Philippine Islands where I assisted in the preservation of the tamaraw, a diminutive buffalo on the island of Mindoro.   The Cape Province has always been of great interest to me although I have never lived there. I always remember my great friend, Colonel Sir Laurens van der Post CBE, giving speeches and talking about the history of the Cape and how the hippo came out into Table Bay to welcome the first settlers and how the black rhino existed on the top of Table Mountain. He had a way of touching the hearts of the audiences that he spoke to. The wild animals and the Bushmen were always part of his story. The wild landscapes of his early youth were deeply ingrained on his psyche. His ability to describe wild landscapes, wild animals and wild people, always left a deep impression. It is no wonder that his Royal Highness Prince Charles came to regard Laurens van der Post as a mentor.   I believe Marcel van der Merwe’s book deserves the thanks not only of South Africans, but people in other countries who increasingly are becoming concerned about the plight of wild animals and wild country in South Africa. The current slaughter of white and black rhino, animals that I have been closely associated with and done my best to protect, is very much in the forefront of the great struggle to conserve our wildlife. The birth of wildlife sanctuaries such as Shamwari and Sanbona, created through the genius and hard work of Adrian Gardiner in the Eastern Cape have proved that wildlife conservation has been a tremendous boon, not only to the conservation of animals, but also to the tourist industry which I believe will eventually prove its critical importance to South Africa because it is sustainable, unlike the minerals which will eventually run out. Adrian Gardiner’s efforts have now been emulated in other parts of the Cape and are proving again not only important for wildlife, but also economics.   The earliest game ranches in South Africa originated in the Cape with the saving of the bontebok and we can be grateful that Adrian Gardiner and others have carried on that tradition. It is my hope that Marcel van der Merwe’s book will inspire other landowners to recreate wild lands for the protection of all wildlife; animals, birds, vegetation and landscapes. His book is a mine of valuable information, a most important resource for present and future conservationists wanting to restore the wild lands of our country.""~ Dr. Ian Player""(born March 15, 1927) a South African environmental educator, conservationist, sportsman and activist.""WHAT WE NEED     In order to make this South African heritage and conservation masterpiece a reality we need funds to cover the final production costs. The bulk of which includes community outreach orientated expenses, and some professional and artistic layout fees and costs regarding final printing.   In order to achieve positive impact in the local, previously disadvantaged communities of South Africa we initially need around $50,000 to facilitate:
The free distribution of books to schools and libraries in rural and previously disadvantaged communities, especially in the Western Cape, Eastern Cape (birthplace of Nelson Mandela) and Northern Cape of South Africa.
The general logistics of community outreach (especially in rural parts of the Cape like the Transkei).
The provision of free consultancy to communities concerning the development of ecological friendly and economically sustainable community owned game reserves, and the logistics involved in such an operation.

<h2>What
is MicroHydro?<br/>
</h2>Micro-hydroelectric systems generate electricity from flowing water without altering the landscape. Instead of building a dam, as with most large hydroelectric systems, microhydro systems simply reroute a portion of the river flow and pass it through a turbine to generate electricity before returning the water to the river. Microhydro is ideal for isolated communities and farms with difficult terrain, and it is a more economical and environmentally friendly way of generating electricity than most other options. For a more extensive explanation of how a microhydro system works, visit our website at <a href=""http://www.hiteca-gt.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.hiteca-gt.com</a>. (You might want to use Google Translate if you don't speak Spanish).<br/>Guatemala has the perfect landscape for microhydro - the mountainous terrain provides areas of drastic elevation change, and streams and rivers flow generously, offering great natural potential to create energy. Microhydro is not an unknown technology in Guatemala, but we estimate that only 10% of the country's micro-hydro capacity is currently being realized. In addition, many of the existing systems are very old (some were installed in the 1950s), and advances in technology mean that their capacity could be greatly increased. Hiteca has the expertise to fill the large unmet need for high-quality personalized engineering to help communities develop the best micro-hydro systems for their needs.<br/> <br/><br/><h2>Our Impact<br/>
</h2>Guatemala is a country where electricity is scarce, expensive and dirty. This has innumerable economic and social consequences, from high costs of production for the country's small farms and industries to reduced opportunities for education for the poor in remote parts of the country. Small scale renewable energy technologies, particularly micro-hydroelectric systems, have a great potential for changing this situation. A typical microhydro system can provide electricity to a community of 300 people that is too remote to connect to the national grid or help a coffee farmer reduce his energy costs during production by up to 80%.<br/><br/>We are already starting to bring this potential impact to reality. This year we have installed a new control and electrical protection system in a microhydro that serves 250 families, rehabilited a system in a community of 50 families and another in an organic coffee and cardamom farm, and have started the fabrication of a completely new system for a 40 family community in partnership with Engineers Without Borders. In total we are contributing to the generation of 80+ kW of clean electricity for over 300 families.<br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><p><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

Waleska is a Guatemalan born business administrator, trained at a local university and well-versed in the challenges of running a business in Guatemala. Together they founded Hiteca in December 2012 and started working with a special focus on micro-hydroelectric systems. <br/></p>
<br/><h2>How YOU can Help<br/>
</h2>Since we started Hiteca in December we have made a lot of progress, installing and repairing four microhydro systems and doing initial studies for several more. We are continuing to meet more people and do more studies to be able to bring more projects to reality. We are excited by this progress, but we need your help to continue to grow. To take on more projects we need to build a workshop and invest in some key tools and equipment. This will allow us to work more efficiently and provide a higher quality product - helping us to bring clean, affordable electricity to more people all around the country.<br/><br/>By helping us to do this we'll show our thanks by giving you a super-awesome Hiteca t-shirt, coffee coaster, notebook, or tote bag (that's right, you'll be the envy of all your friends.

<p class=""FreeForm"">Hi, my name is Jaben Wood. I am a 17-year-old Life Scout from Kalispell, Montana. I have been a Scout since I was six years old. Now I am working on the highest level in scouting, my Eagle Scout Award. An Eagle Project must give back to a community so for my Boy Scout Eagle Project I set a goal of putting in 10 water systems in 10 villages in Uganda, Africa.</p>
<p class=""FreeForm"">I went to Uganda with my family as a 12-year-old and fell in love with the people and the country. I was moved by the plight of so many of the kids. They were my age and had no access to clean drinking water. Later that year I made up my mind to go back to Uganda and take clean water to all those kids I had met. I started planning how to make my dream a reality. I went back to Uganda in 2011 and met with Ugandan Scouts and looked at many villages that did not have any water systems. I want to involve the local scouts in each area so that the villagers see local kids helping build better communities.</p>
<p class=""FreeForm"">After looking at the cost of hiring a well driller, I realized that to be fiscally responsible and plan for a long-term project, I needed to look into buying a drill rig. I am trying to raise enough money to purchase one and have it shipped to Uganda. By having a drill rig, the project will be able to continue long after I have gotten my Eagle Scout Award. Your contribution will not only bring a long-term sustainable project to the Ugandan Scouting program. You will also help bring clean water and improved health for the villagers, and you will enable the children to stay in school and give back to their country.</p>
<p class=""FreeForm""> </p>
<p class=""FreeForm""><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p class=""FreeForm"">I am looking to purchase a RockBuster R77-Mag well drilling rig.  The price for this is:</p>
<p class=""FreeForm"">RockBuster R77-MAG:  $38,500</p>
<p class=""FreeForm"">35 stick of standard duty drill rod:  $7,175</p>
<p class=""FreeForm"">4” step bit:  $145</p>
<p class=""FreeForm"">6” step bit:  $185</p>
<p class=""FreeForm"">4” Chevron:  $150</p>
<p class=""FreeForm"">6” Chevron: $425</p>
<p class=""FreeForm"">4” Rock Roller Bit:  $440</p>
<p class=""FreeForm"">6” Rock Roller Bit:  $1080</p>
<p class=""FreeForm"">2-3/8” Sub:  $265</p>
<p class=""FreeForm"">3-1/2” Sub:  $375</p>
<p class=""FreeForm"">Total:  $48,740.00</p>
<p class=""FreeForm""> </p>
<p class=""FreeForm"">You can see the R77-Mag here <strong><a href=""http://www.rockbuster.com/?page_id=125&amp;sl=r77-mag"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.rockbuster.com/?page_id=125&amp;sl=r77-mag</a></strong></p>
<p class=""FreeForm""> </p>
<p class=""FreeForm"">These prices do not include the cost of shipping or the expense to import the machinery into Uganda. </p>
<p class=""FreeForm"">Anything above my goal will go into funding more wells. I looked at hiring a drill company to do the work but the cost was astronomical, so I am coordinating with Ugandan Scouts on this project and the well rig will stay in Uganda. They will continue the work of scouts4water after my Eagle Project is done. Any excess funds will be held in trust for future maintenance costs. </p>
<p class=""FreeForm"">Each installed water system is designed to be a self-contained, submersible pump run from electricity, where available, or solar power to fill storage tanks. The villages can then have a reserve of water in case of drought.   </p>
<p class=""FreeForm"">For helping with this project we have some great perks for our donors. </p>
<p class=""FreeForm"">$10 donation:   A thank-you letter from the village you helped support</p>
<p class=""FreeForm"">$25 donation:   A photo of the village that you helped with its well</p>
<p class=""FreeForm"">$100 donation: An enameled tin cup with the Scouts4Water logo on it</p>
<p class=""FreeForm"">$1000 donation:  A plaque with your name on it that is on the water holding tank in the village that you helped support</p>
<p class=""FreeForm""> </p>
<p class=""FreeForm"">All perks are cumulative.</p>
<p class=""FreeForm""> </p>
<p class=""FreeForm"">If I am not able to achieve the full campaign amount of funding, I will explore the possibility of purchasing a less expensive drill rig.  The less expensive drill rig is lower in quality and horsepower and may limit the abilities and longevity of the Scouts4Water project. </p>
<p class=""FreeForm""><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p class=""FreeForm"">At the age of 12, I had the opportunity to travel to Uganda with my Youth Group from Christ Church Episcopal. Africa to me is almost indescribable. The city of Kampala with its grungy streets, acrid smells, and high noise level was so different from my home in Montana. There was a strange combination of poverty and technology.—There was no electricity, no refrigeration, and spotty water pressure, but there were also internet cafes and cell phones. The countryside seemed as familiar as home but with banana trees replacing the pines. In the four-hour ride to Bulanga, I was excited to realize I was in Africa yet nervous about being accepted by the people we would be meeting.</p>
<p class=""FreeForm"">Our destination was Hope Child Care Project (HCCP), an orphanage and boarding school for local children ages 4-16.  It provides an education, food, shelter, and most importantly, clean water for approximately 400 children and the surrounding villages. </p>
<p class=""FreeForm"">The village of Bulanga sits another half mile from the school.  It is a small village that borders the main road. As with most of Uganda, Bulanga is very rural.  The average home in Bulanga is about 100 square feet. It has one or two rooms, is built of mud and sticks, and has a grass thatched roof.  This home has no windows, a dirt floor, no indoor plumbing, no kitchen, and houses an average of five to eight people.  Cooking is done primarily over charcoal grills or open fires.  Water is hauled to the house on a daily basis. People commonly have a small patch of land that they farm to feed their family, and they try to have surplus food available to sell at the local market.  They grow coffee, bananas, pineapple, beans, ground nuts, and Irish potatoes. Many of the mothers also make baskets, woven mats, and paper jewelry to sell. </p>
<p class=""FreeForm"">Bulanga is in the middle of the Rakai District of Uganda and is documented to be the location where the AIDS epidemic began.   While there are many single mothers, there are often no parents in the home and older siblings raise younger ones. </p>
<p class=""FreeForm"">A man who stays in the village usually works as a laborer, making the equivalent of $50 a month if he is a hard worker. The teachers who live at HCCP are paid around $100 per month. This is in a nation where 69% of the population live on less than $1 U.S. per day.</p>
<p class=""FreeForm"">I introduced you to Steven in the video. He is a 10-year-old schoolboy at HCCP.  Every morning he walks approximately 1-1/2 to 2 miles to school from his sister’s house, where he lives. The closest water supply to their house is a small creek next to a pineapple plantation. According to Loughborough University, the average distance that women in Africa walk to collect water is six kilometers or 3.7 miles.</p>

</div></div>","Hi, my name is Jaben Wood. I am a 17-year-old Life Scout from Kalispell, Montana. I have been a Scout since I was six years old. Now I am working on the highest level in scouting, my Eagle Scout Award. An Eagle Project must give back to a community so for my Boy Scout Eagle Project I set a goal of putting in 10 water systems in 10 villages in Uganda, Africa.
I went to Uganda with my family as a 12-year-old and fell in love with the people and the country. I was moved by the plight of so many of the kids. They were my age and had no access to clean drinking water. Later that year I made up my mind to go back to Uganda and take clean water to all those kids I had met. I started planning how to make my dream a reality. I went back to Uganda in 2011 and met with Ugandan Scouts and looked at many villages that did not have any water systems. I want to involve the local scouts in each area so that the villagers see local kids helping build better communities.
After looking at the cost of hiring a well driller, I realized that to be fiscally responsible and plan for a long-term project, I needed to look into buying a drill rig. I am trying to raise enough money to purchase one and have it shipped to Uganda. By having a drill rig, the project will be able to continue long after I have gotten my Eagle Scout Award. Your contribution will not only bring a long-term sustainable project to the Ugandan Scouting program. You will also help bring clean water and improved health for the villagers, and you will enable the children to stay in school and give back to their country.
 
What We Need & What You Get
I am looking to purchase a RockBuster R77-Mag well drilling rig.  The price for this is:
RockBuster R77-MAG:  $38,500
35 stick of standard duty drill rod:  $7,175
4” step bit:  $145
6” step bit:  $185
4” Chevron:  $150
6” Chevron: $425
4” Rock Roller Bit:  $440
6” Rock Roller Bit:  $1080
2-3/8” Sub:  $265
3-1/2” Sub:  $375
Total:  $48,740.00
 
You can see the R77-Mag here http://www.rockbuster.com/?page_id=125&sl=r77-mag
 
These prices do not include the cost of shipping or the expense to import the machinery into Uganda. 
Anything above my goal will go into funding more wells. I looked at hiring a drill company to do the work but the cost was astronomical, so I am coordinating with Ugandan Scouts on this project and the well rig will stay in Uganda. They will continue the work of scouts4water after my Eagle Project is done. Any excess funds will be held in trust for future maintenance costs. 
Each installed water system is designed to be a self-contained, submersible pump run from electricity, where available, or solar power to fill storage tanks. The villages can then have a reserve of water in case of drought.   
For helping with this project we have some great perks for our donors. 
$10 donation:   A thank-you letter from the village you helped support
$25 donation:   A photo of the village that you helped with its well
$100 donation: An enameled tin cup with the Scouts4Water logo on it
$1000 donation:  A plaque with your name on it that is on the water holding tank in the village that you helped support
 
All perks are cumulative.
 
If I am not able to achieve the full campaign amount of funding, I will explore the possibility of purchasing a less expensive drill rig.  The less expensive drill rig is lower in quality and horsepower and may limit the abilities and longevity of the Scouts4Water project. 
The Impact
At the age of 12, I had the opportunity to travel to Uganda with my Youth Group from Christ Church Episcopal. Africa to me is almost indescribable. The city of Kampala with its grungy streets, acrid smells, and high noise level was so different from my home in Montana. There was a strange combination of poverty and technology.—There was no electricity, no refrigeration, and spotty water pressure, but there were also internet cafes and cell phones. The countryside seemed as familiar as home but with banana trees replacing the pines. In the four-hour ride to Bulanga, I was excited to realize I was in Africa yet nervous about being accepted by the people we would be meeting.
Our destination was Hope Child Care Project (HCCP), an orphanage and boarding school for local children ages 4-16.  It provides an education, food, shelter, and most importantly, clean water for approximately 400 children and the surrounding villages. 
The village of Bulanga sits another half mile from the school.  It is a small village that borders the main road. As with most of Uganda, Bulanga is very rural.  The average home in Bulanga is about 100 square feet. It has one or two rooms, is built of mud and sticks, and has a grass thatched roof.  This home has no windows, a dirt floor, no indoor plumbing, no kitchen, and houses an average of five to eight people.  Cooking is done primarily over charcoal grills or open fires.  Water is hauled to the house on a daily basis. People commonly have a small patch of land that they farm to feed their family, and they try to have surplus food available to sell at the local market.  They grow coffee, bananas, pineapple, beans, ground nuts, and Irish potatoes. Many of the mothers also make baskets, woven mats, and paper jewelry to sell. 
Bulanga is in the middle of the Rakai District of Uganda and is documented to be the location where the AIDS epidemic began.   While there are many single mothers, there are often no parents in the home and older siblings raise younger ones. 
A man who stays in the village usually works as a laborer, making the equivalent of $50 a month if he is a hard worker. The teachers who live at HCCP are paid around $100 per month. This is in a nation where 69% of the population live on less than $1 U.S. per day.
I introduced you to Steven in the video. He is a 10-year-old schoolboy at HCCP.  Every morning he walks approximately 1-1/2 to 2 miles to school from his sister’s house, where he lives. The closest water supply to their house is a small creek next to a pineapple plantation. According to Loughborough University, the average distance that women in Africa walk to collect water is six kilometers or 3.7 miles.
Water is not as light as you might think. The total weight that Steven carries at least once a day is equal to 40 pounds of water.  The water he carries is for his sister, her three children, and himself. This water is used for cooking, cleaning, bathing, and drinking.
When I revisited Uganda in December 2010, I brought home a water sample at the creek to have it analyzed for choliform bacteria levels. The levels present in that sample were over 24,200 mpn (most probable number)/100ml; the current EPA standard is 235 mpn/100ml. Steven has over 100 times the acceptable amount of e.coli bacteria in his drinking water. Because of the high amounts of e.coli bacteria in the water, many children like Steven will never see adulthood. 
A couple of days after our arrival at HCCP I was able to go see one of the local watering holes. This is when it struck me that their life is so different from mine.

As a keystone species, they keep ocean life balanced and productive. Killing them to extinction is not only a cruel threat to them, it is also a thread to all of us. No sharks = no marine life.For years, many NGOs have been working in different ways to protect sharks. SILENCE OF THE SHARKS will combine their forces by bringing them together. Through a mass dive that will break any prior record, we will raise awareness of the situation to a whole new level.    SILENCE OF THE SHARKS is a non-profit organization founded by David Pilosof (AKA Pilo), a diving veteran with over 30 years of experience in underwater activities all over the world, and supported by many individual believers and leading dive organizations.Pilo: ""It hit me 3 years ago, when I took my first grandson to show him sharks in an underwater observatory. Holding him in my arms, I educated him with a few fun facts. At the same time, I realized he will quite likely never be able to see these amazing creatures in their natural environment. If the killing continues, sharks will end up as a memory of past generations.""           That was just the trigger. Pilo begun exploring the problem. He tried  to learn about the current efforts taken to prevent this horrible scenario and what it means if we do not succeed.The good news:There are hundreds of organizations all over the world, backed by tens of thousands of activists, all committed to solve this ecological disaster. That means: Many people care.
The bad news:
We are still losing and losing big! To date, as a result of overfishing and also by destroying their habitats, only ~20% percent of shark species have managed to survive.
During the five minutes it took you to read to this point, 700 more sharks have been killed.
The worst news: This effects everyone! Not only divers or tree-hugging activists. This effects all of us. Being a top predator, sharks are extremely important. They keep the marine ecosystem in balance.And, this is not just a guessing game. There is already evidence of the impact a loss of sharks can have on an ecosystem. According to Shark Savers, a scientific study conducted in the mid-Atlantic part of the US, showed that when 11 species of sharks were nearly eliminated, 12 of the 14 species those sharks once fed on became so plentiful that they damaged the ecosystem, including wiping out the species farther down the food chain on which they preyed. The negative effects trickle out as the ecosystem gets thrown out of balance.""To change this reality, one of the biggest challenges we need to overcome is being heard by the masses — not only by those who are already convinced. It is necessary to be heard on prime time news and all over the internet, not only in the environmental section.Therefore SILENCE OF THE SHARKS will hold a never seen before event, which will:
Inform and educate people all over the world that sharks are not a soup delight. They are prehistoric, evolutionary-perfect creatures which the ocean’s life - and therefore everyone - is depending on.    
Unite activists, scientists, politicians, influencers of all kind, and passionate people to transfer their know-how and come up with a plan that will be sustained after the event.
Beside the shark conference, the highlight and heart of SILENCE OF THE SHARKS will be a live broadcasted protest dive.More than 500 divers from all over the world will take part. This dive, both technologically and logistically challenging, might end up with a Guinness World Record. This will fuel our message and cause and give it an even louder voice.Dr. Sylvia Earle, one of the most famous marine biologists and explorers in the world, had already confirmed her participation. During the broadcast, Sylvia will be attending the dive site while holding a live conversation with some of the most influential leaders in the world. While we are setting up this campaign more and more influencers from all over the world are giving their commitment to attend SILENCE OF THE SHARKS as well.  Beside the protest dive and conference we are organizing protest and awareness dives in many countries and 'recruiting' the next generation of shark lovers by asking children to give sharks their voice. Already hundreds of touching art pieces are uploaded on our website. And: There is more to come! Beside thousands of hours of volunteering work and even more money spent from private pockets, there is still a large gap we need to close to achieve our mission. Our biggest challenge is spreading the word about the event: The success of SILENCE OF THE SHARKS depends on the exposure we manage to get. The more exposure, the louder our voices for the sharks. Therefore, great efforts will be invested in the promotion and converge of the event. Crowdfunding is the most effective way of getting heard and the word out.We need:
40 % will be invest to promote the event and bring awareness through: TV, radio, press, social media etc.
20 % for technical equipment, e.g. cameras, drones, cases
15 % go directly to the sharks conference for inviting and hosting special guests
15 % are spend to organize the event
10 % for safety and security activities that includes divers, guests, crew and volunteers
So please skip a couple coffee Lattes and invest a few bucks into our future. Official certificate of recognition For your contribution to the campaign you will receive a digital certification signed by Meir Yitzhak Halevi, Mayor of Eilat and David Pilosof, producer of SILENCE OF THE SHARKS.                High Resolution panorama photo of the D-DIVEWe are proud to have the brilliant panoramic photographer Nicolas Barraqué on board. His best photo, taken during the D-Dive, will be an awesome memory of the world's biggest protest dive and your contribution. Shark poster by artist Shlomo CohenShlomo Cohen is a well known caricaturist and cartoonist. His work is marked by a realistic and unique style. Shlomo is considered as a pioneer of working with the digital pen and a much sought-after speaker in this field. We are grateful that he is a supporter of SILENCE OF THE SHARKS from the very beginning. He not only designed the logo statue of our project he also contributes this amazing shark poster (50x70 cm). It comes as a fine art print in best quality.Statue SILENCE OF THE SHARKSThe official campaign logo of SILENCE OF THE SHARKS represents the unique style of Shlomo Cohen. The first original 3D statue was printed by Massivit 3D Printing Technologies Ltd and made of dimengel. The original 3D print (size 90 x 97 x 110 cm) was used during the first protest dive in Eilat in 2015. It is the biggest perk (in any sense) we offer. However, his 'little brother' comes in 12 x 12 cm (made of resin and a silver painted overall shading) and is available for all shark lovers and activists. We pack it with lots of love in hard cardboard box and secure it with polyfoam fill.Signed fine art print by Pascal LecocqPascal Lecocq – the painter of blue says about himself: ""I always have my head in the clouds, and painting permits me to create an imaginary universe between outer space and the depth of the oceans. (...)  The transposition of reality into an underwater world generates some humor, but hides more meanings."" Therefore Pascal is a perfect partner for our mission and with your contribution you will be the owner of his amazing art piece ""The Matador"". It comes as fine art print (50 x 70 cm) and personally signed by Pascal.   A seat on the D-DIVEBe one of 500 divers who are giving sharks their voice. We reserved a limited amount of seats for all shark activists. You will join us on October, 22nd in Eylat and make the D-DIVE remarkable. You want to go after another perk, but be on the D-DIVE as well? No worries! You can save your seat and register here: www.silenceofthesharks.org But please hurry up, as the seats are strictly limited.Signed XXL-print by Amos Nachoum  Amos Nachoum, president of BigAnimals Expeditions is an explorer, guide, genius photographer and wildlife lover. His photos and essays have appeared in hundreds of publications around the globe, including National Geographic, Time, Life, The New York Times, Le Figaro, Der Spiegel, Unterwasser, and many more. As a shark evangelist you get one of his best shark shots. It comes in XX-large scale 2 x1.2 meters, printed on aluminum and personally signed by Amos. This perk is truly a great treasure and reserved to only 5 contributors.Give sharks your voice by:

<p>The Expedition Outline</p>
<p>We are a team of 10 bioscience students from the Exeter and Plymouth University  and Photography Students from Falmouth University travelling to the South-East coast of Madagascar to perform biodiversity studies on the fauna found there. We will be heading out in the beginning of August 2017 for 6 weeks.</p>
<p>Madagascar has been isolated from mainland Africa for over 88 million years; resulting in both high species richness and a significant proportion of endemic species.</p>
<p>Our study site, Loholoka, is a coastal humid forest located 600km from the capital, Antananarivo. Currently, the site has no conservation status and so the area is not protected.</p>
<p>Our aim is to follow up the first comprehensive biodiversity record of the Loholoka forest. Our predecessors’ initial biodiversity survey of this poorly researched area provided evidence of a total of 94 species in the Loholoka forest including 11 Mammals (4 Lemurs), 60 Birds, 12 Reptiles and 11 Amphibians. Of these, 8 were listed as either ‘Vulnerable’ or ‘Endangered’ by the IUCN! This project will allow the establishment of long term conservation of the biodiversity of Loholoka.</p>
<p>Additionally, we hope to sample the frogs we collect on surveys for chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis), ""the worst infectious disease ever recorded among vertebrates in terms of the number of species impacted, and its propensity to drive them to extinction"" according to the IUCN. It is responsible for large amphibian die-offs around the world, however it remains relatively absent in Madagascar and the idea of a potential resistance in Madagascan frogs has been suggested. However, studies have been few and far between and its presence on the island has been recently reported by ZSL. We would like to make sure of its presence in the region of Loholoka to start combating it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Collaboration</p>
<p>We will be collaborating with students from the University of Antananarivo's Botany and Animal Biology Departments, Government Authorities and working closely with Development and Biodiversity Conservation Action for Madagascar (DBCAM) a small Madagascan research NGO who take a grass roots focus when working with local communities.</p>
<p>Through our in-country contacts we are hoping to encourage more student led projects in Madagascar. In addition these strong collaborations will ensure our findings can be used appropriately in Madagascar once we have returned to the UK. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Why It Matters </p>
<p>The world is in a biodiversity crisis which it is estimated that the current species extinction rate is between 1,000 and 10,000 times higher than it would naturally be.</p>
<p>In Loholoka the story is no different, a number of threats to biodiversity have been flagged, namely illegal logging and charcoal production. With your help our research would play a significant role in determining the biodiversity status of the area and the fragility of the species present. Without these vital surveys endangered species may go unprotected furthermore new species maybe lost before they are identified. From 1999 to 2010, scientists discovered 615 new species in Madagascar, including 41 mammals and 61 reptiles. </p>

<h3>Campaign Completion</h3>
<p>A very big thank-you to all who supported Newtecpoly’s Sea Trash to See Treasure campaign!!  While it is clear we finished short of our funding target for the full upgrade, Newtecpoly is committed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Putting the funds raised from this campaign towards a simplified upgrade at our Moama site; and</li>
<li>Honouring our commitment to supply the Indiegogo Perks for each backer of the campaign.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is a photo of the modifications as part of the simplified upgrade we have begun. We remain excited about the PolyWaste technology, and the immense potential benefits the technology offers the world.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>We’ll keep you posted regarding the timing of the perk deliveries, as well as progress of some exciting new trials we have planned for the coming months.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank-you again to you all for backing the Sea Trash to See Treasure campaign, for your generousity, and trust in us, and believing in a better way of recycling waste plastics. The combination of your support and our commitment will make this exciting opportunity a reality.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Newtecpoly is a young company with access to a brilliant new and absolutely unique plastic recycling technology that can deal with contaminated and mixed waste plastics, both hard and soft. Through extensive R&amp;D effort we know the unique mix and melt capability works.  In our pilot testing we’ve even produced a bench, now located at Noosa, from plastic waste collected from the beach! See our video of the process below.</p>
<p>Currently we can mould the planks manually, but this process is slow and super expensive. In order to make our intended huge and positive impact on the environment we need to make it faster and cheaper by upgrading the process.  We know what to do, we just need the funds for the necessary equipment and to upgrade the machinery.</p>
<p>Newtecpoly is seeking your support to raise these funds for the equipment upgrade. This will help clean-up marine debris and convert potentially tonnes of beach waste plastic into useful products,  just like the beach bench we made, now in Noosa.</p>
<p>We need $200,000 for the equipment upgrade. For the moulding equipment itself and the installation at our factory in Moama, New South Wales, Australia.</p>

<p>Ocean Waste Plastic is a huge problem. Here’s some quick facts about Ocean Plastic:</p>
<p>Did you know:</p>
<ol>
<li value=""NaN"">Statistics from a leading environmental authority, Tangaroa Blue, show that 76% of items collected on Australian beaches are plastic.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486094616/lereagy2xzyu2yqnad6b.png"" src="""" style=""""/>
</li>
<li>That there’s an area of waste plastic in the Pacific Ocean termed the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, that is estimated to be 20,000,000 square kilometres.

</li>
<li>If we don’t change our ways, it’s projected that by 2050 the volume of plastic waste in our oceans will be equal to the weight of all the marine life! <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486092299/kehlzt7gsgcxtoi4qdfc.png"" src="""" style=""""/>Page 14, World Economic Forum report <i>The New Plastics Economy</i> <u><a href=""http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_The_New_Plastics_Economy.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_The_New_Plastics_Economy.pdf</a></u>

<p>The <strong>Ellen MacArthur Foundation</strong> has recently released - <i><strong>The New Plastics Economy</strong></i> report:</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/news/new-plastics-economy-report-2-launch"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/news/n...</a></p>
<p>With a great deal of international support by business leaders:</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/news/in-support-of-the-new-plastics-economy"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/news/i...</a></p>
<p>This is an excellent strategy for tackling the waste plastics problem, basically shown as:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486089882/addke2ixjj1lw94jhrse.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Newtecpoly fully supports this strategy, wanting to see worldwide:</p>
<p>1) A reduction in disposable plastic products;</p>
<p>2) Of the plastic products already made, more made with reusable design; and</p>
<p>3) More ways of recycling waste plastic that weren't achievable before.</p>
<p>Newtecpoly can support part 3 above and can recycle plastic waste that was never before possible.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Imagine what the implications of this might be for a world drowning in a sea of plastic waste?!  (See the 7 year old film clip <strong><i>Ghana’s Plastic Waste Menace</i></strong> at <a href=""https://vimeo.com/12034438"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://vimeo.com/12034438</a> to perhaps gain a better understanding of the scale of the plastic waste crisis we all now face).</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Of course, Newtecpoly is not able to solve the world's waste plastic problem alone. But you can help us complete our upgrade goal which will then allow us to show the world what is possible.</p>
<p>To do this we are seeking your support to increase the efficiency of our process. This will make it easier to convert ocean waste into lots of useful products. Like outdoor furniture at the beaches from where the waste was collected.</p>
<p>We need $200,000 for the upgrade. To buy and install a rotary moulding machine, as well as related moulding equipment to increase production efficiency.</p>
<p>How will these funds be spent?</p>
<p>The $200k capital raised would be utilised as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Estimated capital cost of the rotary moulding carousel - $130k</li>
<li>Cost of freight and delivery - $4K</li>
<li>Cost of installation including programming, wiring, etc - $12k</li>
<li>Cost of integration with PolyWaste melter and extruder operations - $14k</li>
<li>Final commissioning - $10k</li>
<li>Rewards for donors - $20k</li>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges, and Our Confidence In The Outcomes</h3>
<p>Newtecpoly is the existing licensee of the new and exciting PolyWaste technology.  We are the first business to use this technology, so success is extremely important to show the world that plastic waste, especially in our oceans, can be cleaned up. Not just moved to landfill! You can find out more about us here (and watch the PolyWaste video):<br/><a href=""http://newtecpoly.com.au/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://newtecpoly.com.au/</a></p>
<p>Peter Barker and Colin Barker are brothers, who along with Michael Ritchie are steering Newtecpoly, dedicated to realising the dream of the inventor and founder Ross Collins, who recently passed away in August 2016.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Newtecpoly is justifiably confident from our trials, that we can mix, melt and deliver molten plastic of almost any composition. We've shown this by the bench made of waste collected from our beaches, using co-mingled and contaminated waste plastic. We know we can make a range of useful products, such as outdoor furniture, raised garden beds, and more.</p>
<p>But this is a new technology, and while it has many suitable applications, it has to make sense financially. This includes collection and transport. It has to be a sustainable activity. It needs to be scalable, with widespread adoption our ultimate goal as this will have the biggest impact.</p>
<p>We are confident that we can produce all the perks, and keep track of the amount of waste collected. Then we know how much new plastic product we've kept out of the ecosystem. The timing for upgrading the production line is probably the hardest to control, as we have some tasks that rely on earlier tasks being completed first. We have identified these as potential bottlenecks or critical project paths.</p>
<p>We have a strong project management plan. With over 35 years of industry experience our team are well placed to handle any unforeseen issues that may arise.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you don't have the means to contribute, please spread the word about our fantastic project. The more successful this project is, the cleaner our beaches and oceans will be, as well as reducing the creation of new plastic.<br/><br/>Please share our project through your social media links, where you can and we'll keep you updated on our campaign, and our progress! Thanks!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Call to action!</h3>
<p>Newtecpoly is excited about the potential applications for the PolyWaste technology, both in Australia and around the globe.  Help us, we seek to really ‘make a difference’ in reshaping the management of plastic waste by fully utilising its value as a resource.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be good if:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The plastic debris on the beaches and in the ocean could be turned into useful products? By providing a use for all waste plastics, a bounty is placed on plastic in the environment.</p></li>
<li><p>This could lead to appropriate infrastructure in each region and facilitate the development of systems to utilise the plastic resource, particularly in developing countries.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We have an established track record in demonstrating the technical capabilities of the PolyWaste technology. This is based on the manufacture of furniture from the October 2016 beach clean-up at Double Island Point in Queensland and through working with the Plastic Police® Partnerships program.  However, further upgrades are needed at Newtecpoly’s Moama facility in order to increase efficiency of the process.</p>
<p>Ultimately, more sites may be needed in each region rather than transporting all of the waste to Moama.  Demonstrating the feasibility of operation at Moama will be the final step in showing the world there is a better way to manage plastic as a resource.<br/> </p>
<p>Help us to demonstrate a better way and make massive global change.  Beyond that, only our imaginations are limiting us.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
<p>If the current campaign of $200,000 is successful, Newtecpoly’s further plans for manufacture of products from waste plastic will be brought forward.</p>
<p>These plans include not restricting ourselves to beach clean-ups. With the success of this campaign, we would recycle and manufacture products from many locations around Australia irrespective of its origin. Such as waste collected from Clean Up Australia Day.</p>
<p>Ultimately our thinking is that we need to make it cost effective to recycle all plastic wastes, to minimise pollution to the environment. It would be like placing a bounty upon it! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>While it depends on how much we raise, any amounts over our target would be used for Newtecpoly’s further development plans, stepwise, this is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Extra 0 to $60k:</strong> Any amounts over our target would be used for processing more plastic waste (and recording how much and where from, for the benefit of supporters).</li>
<li>
<strong>Extra $60k+: </strong>Purchase of calibrator equipment for the manufacture of different extruded products and profiles.The cost of an additional calibrator set will be approximately $60k per additional product to be manufactured.</li>
<li>
<strong>Over $1M: </strong>(we can dream can't we!): Installation of a further processing line at Moama to manufacture additional products.The cost of an additional melter and full production line will be approximately $1M.</li>
<li>
<strong>Over $3M:</strong>(still dreaming, but you might want to know) Establish a new site on the Eastern seaboard of Australia.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, there is no shortage of opportunity to fully utilise all unused plastic resource if the current funding campaign target were exceeded (or smashed).</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Environmental Impact</strong></h3>
<p>(Technical Stuff for those that are interested in that kind of thing)</p>
<p>A Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was completed by Newtecpoly with the support of the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage. This LCA demonstrates the impact of producing plastic products compared to both new plastic and current recycling processes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The results show that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Newtecpoly recycled plastic is less than 10% of the embodied energy of new plastic material and less than 25% of the embodied energy of other recycled plastics (<strong>Figure 1</strong>); and</li>
<li>The Newtecpoly recycled plastic has less than 2% of the carbon emissions associated with production of new plastic products (<strong>Figure 2</strong>).</li>
</ul>

A very big thank-you to all who supported Newtecpoly’s Sea Trash to See Treasure campaign!!  While it is clear we finished short of our funding target for the full upgrade, Newtecpoly is committed to:

Putting the funds raised from this campaign towards a simplified upgrade at our Moama site; and
Honouring our commitment to supply the Indiegogo Perks for each backer of the campaign.

Below is a photo of the modifications as part of the simplified upgrade we have begun. We remain excited about the PolyWaste technology, and the immense potential benefits the technology offers the world.

We’ll keep you posted regarding the timing of the perk deliveries, as well as progress of some exciting new trials we have planned for the coming months.
 
Thank-you again to you all for backing the Sea Trash to See Treasure campaign, for your generousity, and trust in us, and believing in a better way of recycling waste plastics. The combination of your support and our commitment will make this exciting opportunity a reality.
 
Short Summary
Newtecpoly is a young company with access to a brilliant new and absolutely unique plastic recycling technology that can deal with contaminated and mixed waste plastics, both hard and soft. Through extensive R&D effort we know the unique mix and melt capability works.  In our pilot testing we’ve even produced a bench, now located at Noosa, from plastic waste collected from the beach! See our video of the process below.
Currently we can mould the planks manually, but this process is slow and super expensive. In order to make our intended huge and positive impact on the environment we need to make it faster and cheaper by upgrading the process.  We know what to do, we just need the funds for the necessary equipment and to upgrade the machinery.
Newtecpoly is seeking your support to raise these funds for the equipment upgrade. This will help clean-up marine debris and convert potentially tonnes of beach waste plastic into useful products,  just like the beach bench we made, now in Noosa.
We need $200,000 for the equipment upgrade. For the moulding equipment itself and the installation at our factory in Moama, New South Wales, Australia.

The Impact
Ocean Waste Plastic is a huge problem. Here’s some quick facts about Ocean Plastic:
Did you know:

Statistics from a leading environmental authority, Tangaroa Blue, show that 76% of items collected on Australian beaches are plastic.

That there’s an area of waste plastic in the Pacific Ocean termed the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, that is estimated to be 20,000,000 square kilometres. Making bigger than Queensland, Australia or Texas, USA! http://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/...

If we don’t change our ways, it’s projected that by 2050 the volume of plastic waste in our oceans will be equal to the weight of all the marine life! Page 14, World Economic Forum report The New Plastics Economy http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_The_New_Plastics_Economy.pdf

32% of our plastic packaging misses the collection process and finds its way into our water systems and eventually into our oceans. (Page 14, World Economic Forum report The New Plastics Economy)

The Ellen MacArthur Foundation has recently released - The New Plastics Economy report:
https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/news/n...
With a great deal of international support by business leaders:
https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/news/i...
This is an excellent strategy for tackling the waste plastics problem, basically shown as:

Newtecpoly fully supports this strategy, wanting to see worldwide:
1) A reduction in disposable plastic products;
2) Of the plastic products already made, more made with reusable design; and
3) More ways of recycling waste plastic that weren't achievable before.
Newtecpoly can support part 3 above and can recycle plastic waste that was never before possible.
 
Imagine what the implications of this might be for a world drowning in a sea of plastic waste?!  (See the 7 year old film clip Ghana’s Plastic Waste Menace at https://vimeo.com/12034438 to perhaps gain a better understanding of the scale of the plastic waste crisis we all now face).
 

What We Need & What You Get
Of course, Newtecpoly is not able to solve the world's waste plastic problem alone. But you can help us complete our upgrade goal which will then allow us to show the world what is possible.
To do this we are seeking your support to increase the efficiency of our process. This will make it easier to convert ocean waste into lots of useful products. Like outdoor furniture at the beaches from where the waste was collected.
We need $200,000 for the upgrade. To buy and install a rotary moulding machine, as well as related moulding equipment to increase production efficiency.
How will these funds be spent?
The $200k capital raised would be utilised as follows:

Estimated capital cost of the rotary moulding carousel - $130k
Cost of freight and delivery - $4K
Cost of installation including programming, wiring, etc - $12k
Cost of integration with PolyWaste melter and extruder operations - $14k
Final commissioning - $10k
Rewards for donors - $20k
Indiegogo campaign fee - $10k

If the campaign can't raise the target funds, we'll do our best to get close to our project goals, but it obviously depends on how close we get. At the close of the campaign we will send out an update about how we will spend the raised funds, maintaining (where possible)  our original aim of increasing efficiency and reducing plastic waste.

<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>
<p>1. <b>Storm Water Filtration</b> – A cost effective system to remove contaminants from storm water run-off and prevent sewage releases.</p>
<p>2. <b>Brackish Water Filtration</b> – With the addition of Coastal Resources proprietary pre-treatment, (currently under development &amp; testing) the HEF provides low cost desalinated water (NaCl&lt;2,000 PPM) which can then be used for irrigation of crops.</p>
<p>3. <b>Water Reclamation</b> – Industrial water reuse. Reclaiming industrial and food processing waste water streams to be reused in industry as well as for golf course and/or farming irrigation.</p>
<p>4. <b>Membrane pre-filter</b> – By removing particulates down to 2 microns the HEF significantly extends the life of membrane filters and reduces energy costs.</p>
<p>5. <b>Invasive Species Barrier</b> – The HEF can be used to filter ship ballast water eliminating the risk of invasive species such as Zebra Mussels.</p>

</b></b></div>","High Efficiency Filtration--Fresh Water for Urban Farming

                                            A cost effective system to remove contaminants from storm water  run off and prevent sewage releases.  System is compact and can be integrated into storm drainage to protect your community's ecosystem._____________________________________________________________________________Over the past
two years, we developed a system to better treat non-potable water for urban agricultural use. We have planned this system to specifically meet the needs of
urban farming communities and are now going to build our first pilot scale system.  For this, we need your help!What can the High Efficiency Filter Do?
This filter eliminates Total Suspended Solids (TSS) larger than 2
microns. This is far more effective than common sand or media filters. Our innovative chemical free approach is extremely energy efficient
and requires no added chemicals.  Quite simply, it uses a special separation system to turn cloudy water into clear usable irrigation water.  Why is Storm Water Filtration Needed? 
Storm water contains contaminants.  These include, dirt from construction sites, fertilizers used on your yard, and salt from the roads.  Prior to reusing or releasing this storm water it needs to be treated.



The Problem

During heavy rainfall, the contaminants are washed into the storm water collection system. 

Many municipalities have combined sanitary sewers.  Both the water from your toilet and the water from the street travel to the treatment plant in the same pipe.  As the picture below shows, during heavy rains the water overloads the collection system and a combination of storm water and sewage is released into public waterways.  


Urban Farming in Detroit!




Detroit is currently undergoing one of the greatest urban infrastructure projects in history.  In order to solve the problem of increasing sewer releases without investing the capital to build a new treatment plant, the community has decided to build a 120 acre farm in the center of the city on previously blighted land.  This farm, will employ 200 people and use a closed loop water collection system to prevent storm water runoff from entering the sewers.  Partnering with Recovery Park will allow CRI access to resources and funding to further move the project forward.  But, to get to this point we need your help! 
Transforming This                into                       This Farm         


What We Need & What You Get

We need to raise $70,000 to cover all necessary costs for the construction and testing which will be used as a benchmark for future advancement.  Building this pilot scale system and conducting tests will allow us to support RecoveryPark and other green infrastructure projects with a full scale 250,000+
gallon per day system.
As a way
to thank you, you will receive some of the great perks celebrating water treatment and Detroit's Urban farming efforts (see list of Perks based on support level).  There are two reward tiers to separate community and industrial donors.  Community support is key to our success and we want you to get involved with protecting your ecosystem-please help out!.    Industrial support is for municipalities and corporations looking to pursue a CRI water treatment system.  Consider your donation a written promise of our support to fulfill your needs as well as a discount off the full scale high efficiency filter.  Any and all support is welcome!
Other Applications of HEF

1. Storm Water Filtration – A cost effective system to remove contaminants from storm water run-off and prevent sewage releases.
2. Brackish Water Filtration – With the addition of Coastal Resources proprietary pre-treatment, (currently under development & testing) the HEF provides low cost desalinated water (NaCl<2,000 PPM) which can then be used for irrigation of crops.
3. Water Reclamation – Industrial water reuse. Reclaiming industrial and food processing waste water streams to be reused in industry as well as for golf course and/or farming irrigation.
4. Membrane pre-filter – By removing particulates down to 2 microns the HEF significantly extends the life of membrane filters and reduces energy costs.
5. Invasive Species Barrier – The HEF can be used to filter ship ballast water eliminating the risk of invasive species such as Zebra Mussels.
6. Clarifier post treatment filter –Post HEF chlorination will render the water potable to standards acceptable in many parts of the world. Use of the HEF will reduce the quantity and concentration of chemical treatment required to achieve these results providing a substantial cost savings.

<h3>What is Moss Graffiti?</h3>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Moss graffiti (aka, eco-graffiti or green graffiti) replaces spray paint and toxic chemicals with a moss ""paint"" that can grow into whatever design you shape. Moss graffiti reclaims dead spaces and transforms them into living urban ecologies. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""></p>
<h3>What's in a Moss Graffiti Kit?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>A Sprout Guerrilla Moss Graffiti Kit comes with a dry moss mixture, and all you have to do is add water, paint your moss artwork, and help it grow. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/79776/files/20130917100459-resized2.jpg?1379437499"" src="""" style=""width: 557.5582822085889px; height: 374px;""/></p>

<p>The mixture is made from moss and all natural ingredients, like powdered buttermilk, which help the moss grow. Painting with moss is a fun and safe activity for use by kids 6 and up.</p>

</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Founded on the principles of sustainability and effective environmental
design, Toronto-based Sprout Guerrilla seeks to green the world’s urban centres, one blank wall at a
time. As part of our “I ♥ my city” campaign, we're inviting urbanites across Canada and the United States to become guerrilla gardeners. Sprout Guerrilla's Moss Graffiti Kits provide all the materials and instructions necessary for you to take up guerrilla gardening and 'paint' or transplant your own moss masterpiece and make your city green with moss.</p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><p></p>
<h3>What We Need:</h3>
<p>$25,000 Raw Materials [moss, powdered buttermilk and other natural ingredients, packaging] </p>
<p>$3500 Start-Up Expenses [incorporation, trademarking, legal fees]</p>
<p>$2000  Website Development [design, coding, hosting]<br/></p>
<p>$5600  Marketing [videography, product photography, press kit, social media]</p>
<p>$1400 Business and Office Expenses [domain fees, storage, office supplies]</p>
<p>$12,500 Staff [administrative assistant, production assistants]</p>
<p>= $50,000 </p>
<p>Our supply and distribution chain is set up. We need funds to begin ordering the materials, and then we can make and ship your perks.<br/></p>
<p>If we raise $50,000 by selling moss graffiti kits alone, that's enough moss art to cover over 2083 sq ft of concrete jungle and absorb emissions of 2896 sq ft of busy road. <i>*see ""Why It Matters"" below.</i></p>
<p><i>Stretch goals: </i>Funds raised in excess of $50,000 will go towards funding community moss wall projects ($6000 spring 2014) and developing the second generation of Moss Graffiti Kit packaging made with seed paper!</p>
<p>Note: <i>This campaign will receive all funds raised, and fulfill all perks even if it does not reach its goal. </i></p>

<p>Completely customizable, easy to remove, and ecologically sound, Sprout Guerrilla art is a practical and beautiful way to make a powerful statement about urban ecology.</p>
<p></p>
<h3 style="""">Why It Matters</h3>
<p>Thankfully, Sprout Guerrilla moss graffiti is not only aesthetically beautiful, but  environmentally friendly. It's actually has a positive impact on the environment!</p>
<p>Here's the science:</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p>“<i>A calculation
of the absorption of particulate matter by the moss in relation to the
exhaustion of particulate matter:</i></p>
<p><i>A= Busy road
= 14 g/m2 exhaustion of particulate matter per year</i></p>
<p><i>B= Moss = 20
g/m2 absorption of particulate matter per year</i></p>
<p><i>A/B = 0.7 m2
of moss is needed to neutralise the emissions of 1 m2 of a busy road.</i></p>
<p><i>This
calculation is based on ideal conditions for the moss.</i></p>
<i> (The data
used in this calculation are based on a research project from the University of
Bonn, led by Biology professor Jan-Peter Frahm, with moss mats on the side of
the road. Possible deviations from this data are not excluded.)</i>” <a href=""http://www.greenfacadedesign.com/schonelucht.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Green Facade Design.</a><p><i><i></i></i></p>
<p>* Conversion: 1 m2 = 3.28 ft2 </p>
<p>The organic matter supported by moss graffiti metabolizes airborne pollution (such as CO2 emissions) and creates a permeable organic layer that slows the flow of water and reduces the harmful effects of storm-water runoff. As a result, the urban ecological system is healthier, and, in turn, beneficial to human health and wellness.</p>
<p></p>

<p>Each kit contains enough moss mixture to create a 1 sq.ft design. Painting with moss requires care so it can grow and mature into the artwork you created. </p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><i>Tips: </i></blockquote>
<p>Select the location and surface wisely. Moss can grow on vertical and horizontal surfaces, but the material needs to be porous. Wood, brick, concrete, or dense soil are generally good options. This type of moss (sheet moss) thrives in shade. It can tolerate partial sunlight – but not direct afternoon sun! It also needs to be kept moist in order to grow, so check up on your artwork regularly to spritz it with water if needed.</p>
<p>The best time to 'plant' your moss artwork is in moist seasons, like Fall and Spring. Moss needs a chance to mature before it can survive extreme weather. Once the moss is mature, it can handle harsh weather conditions, even drought. The moss will simply stops growing and become dormant until favourable conditions return.</p>

Moss Graffiti Kits, by Sprout Guerrilla - In the News!


        Canada AM: The lowdown on moss graffiti  Julie Forand, founder of Sprout Guerrilla, explains how live moss is being used as wall paint in an effort to turn concrete jungles into environmentally friendly spaces.


""Graffiti in Canada is alive and well. And we do mean alive""

What is Moss Graffiti?
Moss graffiti (aka, eco-graffiti or green graffiti) replaces spray paint and toxic chemicals with a moss ""paint"" that can grow into whatever design you shape. Moss graffiti reclaims dead spaces and transforms them into living urban ecologies. 

What's in a Moss Graffiti Kit?

A Sprout Guerrilla Moss Graffiti Kit comes with a dry moss mixture, and all you have to do is add water, paint your moss artwork, and help it grow. 


The mixture is made from moss and all natural ingredients, like powdered buttermilk, which help the moss grow. Painting with moss is a fun and safe activity for use by kids 6 and up.




Examples of Moss Art:
There are lots of ways to be creative with moss graffiti. Here are some examples of moss artworks:

Moss poem, by: Anna-Garforth; Moss animal, by: the real janelle

About Sprout Guerrilla


Founded on the principles of sustainability and effective environmental
design, Toronto-based Sprout Guerrilla seeks to green the world’s urban centres, one blank wall at a
time. As part of our “I ♥ my city” campaign, we're inviting urbanites across Canada and the United States to become guerrilla gardeners. Sprout Guerrilla's Moss Graffiti Kits provide all the materials and instructions necessary for you to take up guerrilla gardening and 'paint' or transplant your own moss masterpiece and make your city green with moss.
What We Need:
$25,000 Raw Materials [moss, powdered buttermilk and other natural ingredients, packaging] 
$3500 Start-Up Expenses [incorporation, trademarking, legal fees]
$2000  Website Development [design, coding, hosting]
$5600  Marketing [videography, product photography, press kit, social media]
$1400 Business and Office Expenses [domain fees, storage, office supplies]
$12,500 Staff [administrative assistant, production assistants]
= $50,000 
Our supply and distribution chain is set up. We need funds to begin ordering the materials, and then we can make and ship your perks.
If we raise $50,000 by selling moss graffiti kits alone, that's enough moss art to cover over 2083 sq ft of concrete jungle and absorb emissions of 2896 sq ft of busy road. *see ""Why It Matters"" below.
Stretch goals: Funds raised in excess of $50,000 will go towards funding community moss wall projects ($6000 spring 2014) and developing the second generation of Moss Graffiti Kit packaging made with seed paper!
Note: This campaign will receive all funds raised, and fulfill all perks even if it does not reach its goal. 




I ♥ My City
The premise of the campaign is simple: moss hearts are “painted” in public spaces, creating an eye-catching synthesis of art and nature. And to make this painting process as easy as possible, we've created a line of just-add-water kits that provide you with all the tools necessary to create their own moss graffiti masterpiece. 

Completely customizable, easy to remove, and ecologically sound, Sprout Guerrilla art is a practical and beautiful way to make a powerful statement about urban ecology.

Why It Matters
Thankfully, Sprout Guerrilla moss graffiti is not only aesthetically beautiful, but  environmentally friendly. It's actually has a positive impact on the environment!
Here's the science:



“A calculation
of the absorption of particulate matter by the moss in relation to the
exhaustion of particulate matter:
A= Busy road
= 14 g/m2 exhaustion of particulate matter per year
B= Moss = 20
g/m2 absorption of particulate matter per year
A/B = 0.7 m2
of moss is needed to neutralise the emissions of 1 m2 of a busy road.
This
calculation is based on ideal conditions for the moss.
 (The data
used in this calculation are based on a research project from the University of
Bonn, led by Biology professor Jan-Peter Frahm, with moss mats on the side of
the road. Possible deviations from this data are not excluded.)” Green Facade Design.
* Conversion: 1 m2 = 3.28 ft2 
The organic matter supported by moss graffiti metabolizes airborne pollution (such as CO2 emissions) and creates a permeable organic layer that slows the flow of water and reduces the harmful effects of storm-water runoff. As a result, the urban ecological system is healthier, and, in turn, beneficial to human health and wellness.




Perks!

Moss Graffiti Kit



Sprout Guerrilla Moss Graffiti Kit comes with a dry moss mixture, and all you have to do is add water, paint your moss artwork, and help it grow. The mixture is made from moss and all natural ingredients, like powdered buttermilk, which help the moss grow. Painting with moss is a fun and safe activity for kids 6 and up (use parental discretion).

Each kit contains enough moss mixture to create a 1 sq.ft design. Painting with moss requires care so it can grow and mature into the artwork you created. 

Tips: 
Select the location and surface wisely. Moss can grow on vertical and horizontal surfaces, but the material needs to be porous. Wood, brick, concrete, or dense soil are generally good options. This type of moss (sheet moss) thrives in shade. It can tolerate partial sunlight – but not direct afternoon sun! It also needs to be kept moist in order to grow, so check up on your artwork regularly to spritz it with water if needed.
The best time to 'plant' your moss artwork is in moist seasons, like Fall and Spring. Moss needs a chance to mature before it can survive extreme weather. Once the moss is mature, it can handle harsh weather conditions, even drought. The moss will simply stops growing and become dormant until favourable conditions return.

future of our planet. I will explain the project better below but before let me
tell you why this is very important.</p>
<p>The statistics are clear,
although on average there are equal numbers of men and women entering higher
education, the more you go up the ladder, the fewer women are remaining. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447955828/fphess86ariqli38sv7f.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>There are several reasons for that including the difficulty to

network of women in science. It is not only the first ever all-women scientific expedition to Antarctica departing Ushuaia, December 2nd  to 21st  2016. It is not only the chance for us, the first crew, to receive an excellent leadership, strategy and innovation training together and
to build an on-site understanding of polar regions that are changing at an unprecedented

But the future is blurry because of lack of research funding and intense competition for permanent positions. I wanted to be part of it because it is innovative and pushes our comfort zone, it is already so inspiring to interact with the team on our Facebook page. I think creating a network like this is really going to help each of us achieve higher goals and creat a snowball effect.</span><br/></p>

Il a pour but d’élever le rôle des femmes en position de leader, en particulier les femmes dans la science, car nous avons un rôle déterminant à jouer MAINTENANT pour le futur de notre planète. Je donnerai plus de détails sur le projet ci-dessous, mais d'abord laissez moi vous expliquer pourquoi cela est très important. </span></p>
<p>Les statistiques sont claires, bien qu'en moyenne le nombre d'hommes et de femmes qui entament des études supérieures soit équivalent, au plus on monte les échelons, moins il y a de femmes.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447955828/fphess86ariqli38sv7f.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Il y a plusieurs raisons pour cela dont la difficulté d’équilibrer vie de famille et carrière professionnelle, mais aussi:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>L'inégalité salariale entre les sexes</b> (<a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-34842471"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">toujours trop répandue en Europe</a>) ainsi que certaines <b>habitudes historiques/culturelles</b> influencent le choix de la personne qui s’occupe de la maison, des enfants et des personnes âgées. </li>
<li>Le manque de <b>femmes servant d’exemple</b> est frappant dans les responsabilités les plus élevées de la plupart des disciplines:  science, politique, médecine, justice, divertissement, industrie, finance... et <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/worldviews/2012/01/19/the-role-model-effect-women-leaders-key-to-inspiring-the-next-generation/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">limite l'inspiration des filles, garçons et leurs parents</a> sur les possibilités qui s'offrent à eux. </li>
<li>
<b>L'image des femmes dans les médias </b> positionne le corps plutôt que l'esprit au centre de tout  (très bien expliqué dans le documentaire : <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ap2xnMcvpw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Miss Representation</a>). C'est pour cela que les filles et les femmes manquent souvent de confiance, d'estime d'elles mêmes et de compétences en communication leur permettant d'atteindre les postes à haute responsabilité. </li>

Hello and thank you for
visiting this page =)
The video you have just seen
(or are going to watch just now) was my application to a fantastic project: Homeward Bound. It aims at elevating the role of women in leadership and in
particular women scientists as we have a determinant role to play NOW for the
future of our planet. I will explain the project better below but before let me
tell you why this is very important.
The statistics are clear,
although on average there are equal numbers of men and women entering higher
education, the more you go up the ladder, the fewer women are remaining. There are several reasons for that including the difficulty to
balance family life with a successful career:
The gender pay gap (still too big in Europe) along with historical/cultural habits influences who is the person spending more time taking care of the
home, kids and elderly. 

The lack of
women role-models in the
highest responsibilities is striking in most disciplines: science, politics,
medicine, law, entertainment, industry, finance... and refrain from inspiring
girls, boys and their parents on the possibilities in front of them. 

The image of women in
the media brings the body at the centre of everything
rather than the mind (very well explained in a great documentary: Miss Representation). Therefore girls and women often lack the self-esteem, confidence, communication skills needed to
reach the highest responsibilities. 
The issues of gender equality and climate change are intimately connected and could be tackled at the same time. Recent studies have shown that women are more affected by climate change and
extreme weather events than men but also that women are more aware and responsive to climate change. Our planet and its biodiversity are being destroyed at an unprecedented rate, we need a new dynamic in both highest impact climate science and
critical environmental political decisions. Women think and work differently and it is by considering this richness of skills, ideas and points of view
altogether that a better efficiency in actions at the global scale can be
reached.

So how do we do that? Homeward
Bound is the world's first state-of-the-art leadership and
strategic program for 78 Women in Science from around the globe (Australia,
New-Zealand, USA, Canada, UK, Germany, France). It is not only the start
of a 10 year outreach initiative to build a 1,000 strong global collaboration
network of women in science. It is not only the first ever all-women scientific expedition to Antarctica departing Ushuaia, December 2nd  to 21st  2016. It is not only the chance for us, the first crew, to receive an excellent leadership, strategy and innovation training together and
to build an on-site understanding of polar regions that are changing at an unprecedented
rate. It is about helping more women of our
generation to reach leadership roles by gaining the confidence and networking
skills that are needed so that we can become role models for the next
generation. 




A documentary crew, will follow us before, during and after the
expedition, this is the trailer they have made. Homeward Bound benefits from
the support of globally recognised women and men of influence, including Dr Jane Goodall,
Primatologist and environmental activist, Franny Armstrong, one of the
world’s 100 most influential women, Sylvia Earle, famous marine ecologist
and celebrated activist filmed by James Cameron in Mission Blue, Dr Susan David, Co-Founder and Director of the Institute of Coaching, Harvard A-lister, Clare Bowditch – award winning singer and activist, Dr Robert Kaplan and Dave Norton – developed strategy mapping, balanced score card.
I applied to this initiative because I am at a critical time in my career, I just became a mum so I am very aware and militant for the challenges women are facing, I am passionate and made so many sacrifices that there is no way I am letting it go now. But the future is blurry because of lack of research funding and intense competition for permanent positions. I wanted to be part of it because it is innovative and pushes our comfort zone, it is already so inspiring to interact with the team on our Facebook page. I think creating a network like this is really going to help each of us achieve higher goals and creat a snowball effect.
I am so lucky to be
a part of such an exceptional and inspiring project. The cost for me to attend is £10,000 or €14,000, which covers half of the costs of the cruise, the staff, the training and the film crew. The other half is arranged by Homeward Bound. Could you help me go forward in the common interests of Women, Men and our Planet???

If clicking on it does not work, try right click and open in a new window. Homeward Bound is the brainchild of renowned Australian leadership expert Fabian Dattner, and the product of a magic collaboration with Dr Jess Melbourne‐Thomas from the Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre.
                                  


Bonjour et merci de visiter cette page =)
La vidéo que vous venez de voir (ou que vous allez regarder maintenant) a été préparée pour postuler à un projet fantastique: Homeward Bound. Il a pour but d’élever le rôle des femmes en position de leader, en particulier les femmes dans la science, car nous avons un rôle déterminant à jouer MAINTENANT pour le futur de notre planète. Je donnerai plus de détails sur le projet ci-dessous, mais d'abord laissez moi vous expliquer pourquoi cela est très important. 
Les statistiques sont claires, bien qu'en moyenne le nombre d'hommes et de femmes qui entament des études supérieures soit équivalent, au plus on monte les échelons, moins il y a de femmes.

Il y a plusieurs raisons pour cela dont la difficulté d’équilibrer vie de famille et carrière professionnelle, mais aussi:


L'inégalité salariale entre les sexes (toujours trop répandue en Europe) ainsi que certaines habitudes historiques/culturelles influencent le choix de la personne qui s’occupe de la maison, des enfants et des personnes âgées. 
Le manque de femmes servant d’exemple est frappant dans les responsabilités les plus élevées de la plupart des disciplines:  science, politique, médecine, justice, divertissement, industrie, finance... et limite l'inspiration des filles, garçons et leurs parents sur les possibilités qui s'offrent à eux. 

L'image des femmes dans les médias  positionne le corps plutôt que l'esprit au centre de tout  (très bien expliqué dans le documentaire : Miss Representation). C'est pour cela que les filles et les femmes manquent souvent de confiance, d'estime d'elles mêmes et de compétences en communication leur permettant d'atteindre les postes à haute responsabilité. 

Les problèmes d’égalité des sexes et de changement climatique sont intimement liés et pourraient être réglés en même temps. Des études récentes ont montré que les femmes sont plus affectées par le changement climatique et les événements climatiques extrêmes que les hommes, mais également que les femmes sont plus au fait et réactives vis a vis du changement climatique. Notre planète et sa biodiversité sont détruites à une vitesse sans précédent, nous avons besoin d'une nouvelle dynamique à la fois dans les études climatiques à fort impact et les décisions politiques environnementales critiques. Les femmes pensent et travaillent différemment et c'est en considérant cette richesse de compétences, d’idées et de points de vue ensembles qu'une meilleure efficacité dans les actions à grande échelle pourra être atteinte. 
Comment arriver à cela ? Homeward Bound est le premier programme au monde de leadership et stratégie pour 78 femmes dans la science venant des quatre coins du globe (Australie, Nouvelle-Zélande, Canada, Royaume Uni, Allemagne, France). Ce n'est pas seulement le début d'une initiative de 10 ans pour construire un réseau global de collaboration fort de 1000 femmes dans la science ; ce n'est pas seulement la première expédition scientifique exclusivement féminine de l'histoire à partir pour l’Antarctique depuis Ushuaïa entre le 2 et 21 Décembre 2016 ; ce n'est pas seulement la chance pour nous, la première équipe, de recevoir une excellente formation sur le leadership, les stratégies et l'innovation ensemble et construire un savoir in-situ des régions polaires qui sont en plein changement et à une vitesse sans précédent ; c'est aussi pour aider plus de femmes de notre génération a atteindre des rôles de leader en gagnant la confiance et le réseau qui sont nécessaires afin de devenir des exemples pour les générations futures.

Une équipe de documentaire nous suivra avant, pendant et après l’expédition. Voici the trailer qu'ils ont réalisé. Homeward Bound bénéficie du support d'hommes et de femmes d'influence mondialement reconnus comme Dr Jane Goodall, primatologue et activiste environnementale, Franny Armstrong, l'une des 100 femmes les plus influentes du monde, Sylvia Earle, écologiste marine reconnue et célèbre activiste filmée par James Cameron dans ""Mission Blue"", Dr Susan David, Cofondatrice et Directrice de l’institut de Coaching, Harvard A-lister, Clare Bowditch – chanteuse récompensée et activiste, et les stratégistes Dr Robert Kaplan et Dave Norton.

Poaching at this time can easily slip out of control, and we believe that our presence here was vital in order to maintain a presence and an independent voice to the reality of what is going on here.</p><p>THE HISTORY 24 MARCH 2013 UNTIL PRESENT DAY.</p><p>
</p><p>Sangha lodge in the Central African Republic has remained
active throughout the conflict and the troubles. </p>
<p>On March 24 the rebel alliance of Seleka managed to
overthrow the government in Bangui and effectively took control of the whole
country. We at Sangha lodge held on believing that we would not be in any
danger personally from these rebels, while the staff from the WWF evacuated to
Bomassa in Rep. Congo. However later that night our staff pleaded with us to
leave, and we did. We were not really in fear of our own safty, but rather in
fear of their safety. They would feel obligated to protect us and this would
put their lives in danger.</p>
<p>We had and adventure heading down river at night to Congo
and onwards to our home in South Africa. Meanwhile the staff at WWF headed home
for the home countries and while some based themselves in Yaoundé. In early
May  while conservation staff stayed in
exile a massacre of elephants occurred at Dzanga bai, this is well documented,
and while conservation staff from WWF stayed away frustrating us who have real
passion for this area, a private security consultant Nir Kalron, from Maisha
consulting came to Dzanga to start negotiating with the rebels in control.</p>
<p>We, that is Tamar and I in the meantime were at this stage
very frustrated in South Africa as we now had no money to return. At this time
we realised that our presence was vital to the morale of the local population
who felt that the outside world had abandoned them.  While looting and thieving was going on by
Seleka and local elements of the population, Sangha lodge itself was
deteriorating too. Cables, electrical fittings, plumbing fittings and pipes, as
well as all our alcohol and food stores were stolen by locals. Our staff
remained loyal and did their best to protect the lodge but the onslaught was
too intense at times. </p>
<p>At this time we received a gift of money from a very
generous benefactor, the Lindberg family, and this inspired us to return
immediately. Following news of our plans to return others helped and we also
extended our own credit from our bank in South Africa. We believed that the
crisis would end as soon as the WWF returned, and they kept saying they would
be coming back next month, well next month lead into another next month and 8
months down the line the latest news is they will be returning next month
[February]. I must say though that
Maisha consulting has been hired by the WWF at this time so we are not entirely
alone, there are Tamar and myself at the lodge, a security consultant at the
WWF office, and Louis Sarno.</p>
<p>In the meantime we have remained here at the lodge and have
contributed where we can to ongoing efforts with conservation and community. We have had many meetings about the future and
the reason to continue with conservation and our community tourism plans with
locals and have won the hearts and minds of most we believe.</p>
<p>We have assisted Maisha
Consulting in building an installation at Dzanga bai so that the bai can be
monitored 24/7 with security cameras. We have aided Drive against malaria to
return and continue their work in the fight against malaria. And we continue to
distribute Free of charge medicines wherever we are qualified to…simple
diagnoses like malaria and some infections.</p>
<p>Our most exciting day however was our direct involvement
with catching an elephant poacher, the first elephant poacher to be arrested in
the APDS in the 5 years since our arrival. Ironically this arrest was with the
help of Seleka the rebels.</p>
<p>The future for us remains uncertain; 12 months without
earnings have drained our resources and left us on the verge of bankruptcy,
only the generosity of clients, friends and family that has kept us alive until
now. We are optimistic that the worst of
the troubles are over and that Central Africa and especially this isolated
corner of Central Africa will return to a form of normality that we had in the
past. Our big issue now is to raise bridging finance to see us though the
coming hard times, and we are pleading with all our loyal agents to help us survive
this period. </p>
<p>The basic costs of keeping the lodge and the staff alive as
well as continue with some of our developments with the local communities and
maintain the lodge is in the region of 2 million CFA per month. That is approximately
3000 euros.  By the end of February we
will be at the turning point and have to decide what direction to go in, but we
are pleading for any form of assistance you can give us to help us through.</p>

consulting came to Dzanga to start negotiating with the rebels in control.
We, that is Tamar and I in the meantime were at this stage
very frustrated in South Africa as we now had no money to return. At this time
we realised that our presence was vital to the morale of the local population
who felt that the outside world had abandoned them.  While looting and thieving was going on by
Seleka and local elements of the population, Sangha lodge itself was
deteriorating too. Cables, electrical fittings, plumbing fittings and pipes, as
well as all our alcohol and food stores were stolen by locals. Our staff
remained loyal and did their best to protect the lodge but the onslaught was
too intense at times. 
At this time we received a gift of money from a very
generous benefactor, the Lindberg family, and this inspired us to return
immediately. Following news of our plans to return others helped and we also
extended our own credit from our bank in South Africa. We believed that the
crisis would end as soon as the WWF returned, and they kept saying they would
be coming back next month, well next month lead into another next month and 8
months down the line the latest news is they will be returning next month
[February]. I must say though that
Maisha consulting has been hired by the WWF at this time so we are not entirely
alone, there are Tamar and myself at the lodge, a security consultant at the
WWF office, and Louis Sarno.
In the meantime we have remained here at the lodge and have
contributed where we can to ongoing efforts with conservation and community. We have had many meetings about the future and
the reason to continue with conservation and our community tourism plans with
locals and have won the hearts and minds of most we believe.
We have assisted Maisha
Consulting in building an installation at Dzanga bai so that the bai can be
monitored 24/7 with security cameras. We have aided Drive against malaria to
return and continue their work in the fight against malaria. And we continue to
distribute Free of charge medicines wherever we are qualified to…simple
diagnoses like malaria and some infections.
Our most exciting day however was our direct involvement
with catching an elephant poacher, the first elephant poacher to be arrested in
the APDS in the 5 years since our arrival. Ironically this arrest was with the
help of Seleka the rebels.
The future for us remains uncertain; 12 months without
earnings have drained our resources and left us on the verge of bankruptcy,
only the generosity of clients, friends and family that has kept us alive until
now. We are optimistic that the worst of
the troubles are over and that Central Africa and especially this isolated
corner of Central Africa will return to a form of normality that we had in the
past. Our big issue now is to raise bridging finance to see us though the
coming hard times, and we are pleading with all our loyal agents to help us survive
this period. 
The basic costs of keeping the lodge and the staff alive as
well as continue with some of our developments with the local communities and
maintain the lodge is in the region of 2 million CFA per month. That is approximately
3000 euros.  By the end of February we
will be at the turning point and have to decide what direction to go in, but we
are pleading for any form of assistance you can give us to help us through.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Since that time, we've tried just about every prescribed remedy to help alleviate his symptoms. Our breakthrough came when we learned the power of personal connection through acceptance -- you know, that thing that dogs do naturally and unconditionally.  As lifelong dog lovers, we decided to get Elliot an autism service companion.  When his dog, Orbit, came home it changed our lives. Not only did Orbit help mediate Elliot's disability, but when together as a team in public Elliot and Orbit positively changed the environment wherever we went. Both of these things are really big deals for a family living with autism -- game changers. So big that we were inspired to start a non-profit organization to help other families like ours.<br/> <p>Good Dog! Autism Companions was born in 2011. We have provided service dogs for 16 families and because of their success stories we have a wait list that's getting longer and longer. The high demand for our companion dog program has called for a new model of support. The goal of this campaign is to help launch this new model by getting a new crew of puppies in training so we can start to provide more trained service dogs to more families in need with shorter wait time. Currently, it takes about 18 months to 2 years -- That's just too long. So please join us by contributing and becoming part of our pack. Together we can make this world a more loving and welcoming place for everyone.<br/></p><h3><b><h3>What We Need - More Puppies in our Pack<br/>

understand. We know this firsthand. We hope we explained it for you above so that you could understand some more about what children and families living with autism are going through. In addition, we hope we provided you with an understanding for how an autism service dog can help. Below, we've included some frequently asked questions just in case you want to know more:</p><h4>1. How do you train your dogs?</h4><p>We use the Bergin University of Canine Studies methodology that uses only positive reinforcement. We start socialization of our puppies early on, then teach basic training, then advanced training. During the last few months we add in any specific skills that our dogs must learn to meet the needs of their unique child companion. <br/></p><p></p><h4>2. What can a service dog do for kids with autism?</h4>Studies have shown that autism service dogs in the home reduce stress 
hormone levels in children with autism. Parents are reporting many other
 benefits of these faithful, hard-working companions as well. Here are more of the life-enhancing  experiences that can be attributed to owning a companion dog: calming, social, communication, companionship, independence, and quality of life. For more detailed information, please refer to ""Our Solutions"" section above. <p></p><h4>3. How is an autism service dog different from other service dogs?</h4>Most people are familiar with the concept of the service dog through their experience seeing those with physical disabilities where a working dog can provide help with mobility and/or vision. An autism service dog is utilized to mediate the disability by acting as a social bridge, providing sensory input, aiding in redirecting and focusing, as well as offering unconditional love with constant companionship. Autism Service dogs have also been referred to as SsigDogs, which stands for Social and Sensory Signaling Dogs.<div>

<span style=""font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 24px;"">4. How much does an autism service dog cost?</span><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">There is a cost associated for a service dog provider to perform all functions necessary to finish a fully trained dog for a specific person in need. Depending on the size of the organization and complexity of the services they are providing, these costs can vary widely. Industry range is from $10,000 up to $50,000 per dog.</span><br/></p>
<p>Some larger non-profit organizations raise all money necessary and can provide dogs almost cost-free. Most organizations ask recipients to help fund raise either part or all of the costs involved to provide their service. At Good Dog! we share the fund raising responsibilities with our families. Our families are required to raise 13,000 and our organization raises the other 13,000, so together we cover the cost of each dog. We offer our families fund raising coaching and tools to help them meet their goal and have been very encouraged by the support the families receive from their communities! </p>
<h4>5. Why does it cost so much?</h4>
<p>Autism service dogs need to be specifically and carefully bred, trained, and matched  to be most effective with their team partners. Families receiving service dogs should also be specifically and carefully trained and matched with their dogs :) To be successful an organization should employ expert multidisciplinary teams in both the canine and autism arenas.   </p>

<h4>8. Why do you give the dogs nicknames?</h4>
<p>We must state first that we reserve final naming of all Good Dogs for the child receiving their companion. We believe that when the child and family name their dog it aids in the bonding process. But, since our matching process occurs well into a puppies training period, meaning we do not know who will be best matched with whom quite yet, we have to call the little fur balls something. And besides, it's just plain fun coming up with their nicknames!</p>

A Good Dog! creates a public environment of acceptance and non-judgement
A Good Dog! brings autism families back together with their local communities
The world will be a better place with more Good Dogs in it. 
More puppies = More Good Dogs = Change the world. Simple canine calculus.

  Orbiting Autism
In 2002, our son, Elliot was diagnosed with autism. Since that time, we've tried just about every prescribed remedy to help alleviate his symptoms. Our breakthrough came when we learned the power of personal connection through acceptance -- you know, that thing that dogs do naturally and unconditionally.  As lifelong dog lovers, we decided to get Elliot an autism service companion.  When his dog, Orbit, came home it changed our lives. Not only did Orbit help mediate Elliot's disability, but when together as a team in public Elliot and Orbit positively changed the environment wherever we went. Both of these things are really big deals for a family living with autism -- game changers. So big that we were inspired to start a non-profit organization to help other families like ours. Good Dog! Autism Companions was born in 2011. We have provided service dogs for 16 families and because of their success stories we have a wait list that's getting longer and longer. The high demand for our companion dog program has called for a new model of support. The goal of this campaign is to help launch this new model by getting a new crew of puppies in training so we can start to provide more trained service dogs to more families in need with shorter wait time. Currently, it takes about 18 months to 2 years -- That's just too long. So please join us by contributing and becoming part of our pack. Together we can make this world a more loving and welcoming place for everyone.What We Need - More Puppies in our Pack
Our goal is to get funding for 10 new furry recruits to enter our Puppy Program - $50,000. Our
 per puppy costs include breeders fees, medical, training, food and supplies, transportation, program management and insurance. It 
adds up fast.All
 funds raised in this campaign will go toward our service dog training and placement programs 
regardless of whether our goal is reached, stretched, or not...so you can be sure 
your contribution intent will be honored by us.  Wags! Recognizing Your Generosity. Thank You!
Our amazing Part of the Pack Perks - AKA our ""high 
value human treats"" will make you wag, for sure. They could even make 
you beg for more...we hope they do! 
Let's Celebrate #GivingTuesday Together
We have a day for giving thanks -- Thanksgiving. We have two days for getting great deals -- Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Now, we 
have #GivingTuesday, a global day dedicated to celebrate the spirit of generosity and charitable giving. On Tuesday, December 2, 2014,
 charities, families, businesses, community centers, foundations, and students around
 the world will come together for one common purpose: to celebrate 
generosity and to give back.By contributing to the Good Dog! #GivingTuesday #UNselfie Perk, we will help you show the world how you support children & families living with autism and their canine companions! Just email us your #UNselfie and we will share it with all of our Twitter, Face Book and Instagram followers. We will also include your #UNselfie on our Wall of Thanks website page. It's like your big, hearty, enthusiastic, digital, party BARK during this special day of the year.  Our Founders' Story

We believe that all children and families living with autism deserve to be accepted and connected in our world .. . and Good Dogs can facilitate this for them. We truly live our mission and love sharing it with the world.Our Autism Community's Challenges
The most recent statistics for the incidence of autism published by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) in 2014 show that 1 in 68 children born in the US is now affected. That is an increase of 30% in just two years. Clearly, this has become an unstoppable epidemic that needs to be addressed from many angles. Because there is still no known cause or cure for autism, and each child affected presents symptoms differently, trying to function in our world can be a very frustrating experience for the child. These are actual comments made by total strangers toward autism families out in public with their child with autism and no Good Dog!by their side:Kid: “Mom, what’s wrong with that kid?” Kid’s Mom: “Nothing a little discipline won’t fix.”  I    “Your child needs an exorcism.”  I   ""If I ever acted like that in a store, my mother would have beat me.”There are too many living with autism having to deal with this today. We
 are encouraged when judgment and condemnation forthcoming from 
strangers is transformed into acceptance and connection when a Good Dog!
 enters the scene.Our Solutions
Our goal is to bring the benefits of the human/canine relationship to children and families living with autism so they can experience a higher quality of life. Wefacilitate this by honoring the uniqueness of each person, dog and community we serve to insure the long-lasting bonds we create together are infused withintegrity, positivity and love. Today, we have 16 Good Dogs in service and 13 families approved and waiting for their new companions. A companion dog provides a bridge for a child with autism to connect with the world. Studies have shown that autism service dogs in the home reduce stress hormone levels in children with autism. Parents are reporting many other benefits of these faithful, hard-working companions as well.Giving is Good, Dawg - Our Need for Funding Help
Good Dog! Autism Companions is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that relies on charitable giving to support our cause. We ask all families who get approved for a Good Dog! to fund raise half the costs of their program in their local spheres. This has created an amazing outpouring of support for our Good Dog! families. It's reconnecting them with their communities in a very special way -- we could not be happier that we have ignited this spirit of giving in so many places.This model has served us well as a start-up, but now due to our minimum fund raising requirements needed in order to acquire a puppy on a family's behalf, they are having to wait too long to get their fully trained service dog. High demand for our services called for a new model. By starting a reserve team of puppies in training, we can begin to reduce lead times and expand our program to accommodate even more families in need. That's why we need your help.WOOF!!

glory.</b> California Trout’s 3-year restoration project on Hat Creek is now in its
second year and great progress has been made but we need your help to raise
$25,000 to fully fund the project, match a grant received from Orvis, and ensure that Hat Creek is a vibrant ecosystem and fishery for generations to come.</p>
<h4><b>Background</b></h4><p>Reports from the early 1900s
suggest that Hat Creek was once <span>California’s
premier spring-creek fly fishing experience. By the 1960s, however, the fishery collapsed due to invasive, non-game
fish and heavy angling pressure. In 1968,

-- a major paradigm shift away from hatchery supported fisheries. But in the
early 1990s, conditions began to deteriorate again due to heavily degraded streambanks,
unrestricted cattle grazing, and a collapse of native aquatic vegetation. </p>
<p><b>In 2012</b>, <b>CalTrout secured the largest restoration grant in the organization’s
40-year history</b>. This funding is helping to support a substantial,
three-year project that began in the summer of 2013.</p>

<p></p></div>","Tandem Festival20 - 22nd June 2014 @ Hill End, Oxford
So what’s the deal?
Pan-european, intimate and inspiring, Tandem is a brand
new festival, starting this year at Hill End, Oxford. Tandem Festival will showcase a diverse
range of musicians and performers, alongside workshops, documentaries and
talks promoting community projects and eco-living, all whilst making as little
environmental impact as we can. Set in Hill End's stunning
63 acres site, the festival will bring together music lovers of all ages to listen,
learn, and dance together.  
At Tandem Festival, listening is key. Our acoustic
performance spaces, from barns to yurts, will bring you closer to the music,
enabling the rediscovery of sound without large amplification. Our performers are coming from across Europe, with acts including Sophie ter Schure, Jack & The Arrows, and Little Shoes Big Voice. Exploring the
possibilities of European mobility, we're inviting our performers and our audience to join in the celebration by bike if they can! To facilitate this, we're organising bike convoys from around the UK and Europe - keep an eye on our Facebook page closer to the time if you'd like to join us, or even lead a convoy yourself!
  Environmentally, the festival will serve as a medium to
inform and teach about key environmental issues such as food waste, recycling,
climate change, and energy production and consumption. Speakers and
documentaries will focus on these topics throughout the festival, whilst
workshops will facilitate learning in a fun, hands-on environment!  

Where will your money go? What are our ideals?
The more we raise, the better the festival! Here are just a few of our aims and ideals:


We are looking to commission a local artist to create a
bike rack for Hill End


We want to help push the campaign for a bike path to Hill
End


We want to ensure all bands are reimbursed fairly


We want to build compost loos for Hill End from upcycled
timber


We want to ensure we leave Hill End's land in the
tranquil and healthy state that we found it


We want to gather together knowledgeable and inspirational
speakers on sustainability

We want to get all festival food from local producers
Importantly, Tandem is a not-for-profit venture, we will plough any profit back into the Hill End site and into ensuring Tandem's future.
The Impact?
Tandem Festival wants to work together with the Hill End
site and festival goers to create a lasting legacy. Our range of workshops mean you won't just leave with incredible memories, but also a whole
range of useful skills and knowledge - from mending and up cycling clothes, through fixing bikes, to understanding more about sustainable living and about the
importance of living ecologically.  
The festival isn't just a one-off party, we are creating
an event that will keep running for years to come, and we want to enable more
and more people to enjoy the environment through Hill End's amazing work. Pre-Festival EventsThe festival will be running from the 20th to 22nd June 2014 but if you can’t wait till then, why not come along to one of the pre-festival events and get stuck in!   
Community group gathering [Sunday 16th February 2014, 4-6pm @ Turl St Kitchen, Oxford]

Anthony.  I have created 7 food forests and 650 gardens for community
members in Eugene, Oregon over only a 5 year period.  While traveling in
India farmers I met told me about severe water problems.  They have to
either do dry land farming or dig new bore wells every 2 years.  The
rainfall is continuing to decrease.   In some areas dry land farming is no
longer working.  To alleviate the water crisis the Indian government is
paying farmers for the labor, the manure and for the seedlings to entice them
to plant trees.  The farmers do not feel that they can afford to plant
trees because they take a long time to yield.  I believe to be really
sustainable our practices need to pay the farmers a living wage so they can
grow food.  To this end I have developed practices of interplanting crops
with the trees which will yield money in the first year and will, along with
the fruits of the trees, produce a significantly increased income for the
farmers once the trees start bearing.  The farmers I am talking to in our
target area love the idea.   They want to see it to believe it. </p>
<p>We are helping farmers
who do not have water to grow food.  Many
of the farmers in India have learned that they can grow hybrid vegetables,
hybrid trees, with chemicals and export these for what they consider reasonable
sums of money.  With desertification they
no longer have the water resources to do this. 
The methods the farmers have been told will give them more yield take
3-4 times the amount of water.  We are
showing them how to get slightly less yields on the main crop by using
permaculture and natural farming methods, but get more money overall by doing
intercropping.  Another part of our
program is to create awareness and  demonstrate the benefits of reservoirs,
swales, key lines, to restore ground water and rainfall.  There are many steps to this process so see
our web site if you want to know more.</p>
<p>Our goal is to have
100 farmers participating in our program before the monsoon starts in June,
2014.  We are offering them seeds which
they pay it forward when their own seeds come in.  We are offering to buy their crops for a
premium above what they can get from the local markets because they are organic.  We have found a report by an NGO stating that
6 x 6 meter ponds have worked for restoring ground water in 2 acre plots.  It seems that there is a history of these
methods working in the past, so the farmers seem eager to start these water
conservation practices.  </p>
<p>1)<span> 
</span> To do this we need to outreach to the local
farmers who have water problems. We need to work with governmental agencies,  NGO’s and local community organizations to
find out who these farmers are.</p>
<p>2)<span> 
</span> We will set up a marketing arm which will
contact potential organic suppliers, meaning the farmers who are too poor to
use chemical fertilizers, and see if they need our help to increase their
economic base.</p>

already thousands of suicides due to farmers losing their land. Without
our work, there will be many millions of starving people as well as more farmer
suicides.  This desertification is worldwide, involving more than 90% of
the earth's surface.   One advantage to working in India is that the
farmers here are desperate and once they see the model will work not only for
the water, but will give them a living wage, they will incorporate it
immediately.  Our organization which is only months away from forming an
NGO has many local people involved who will carry on the work and spread it
throughout India and we hope the world.  We are working with ways that are
inexpensive to install, increasing the likelihood of them going viral.  So

<p><strong>Ahoy,</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>     Welcome to the Ancient Future Mystery People's Pirate Academy. The AFMPPA is a free and borderless civilization for a new age.  Finally, a new world is growing where people are set free to reach to their natural potential. A place where you can eat and live healthily from an organic permaculture garden, drink rain water, learn to cultivate industrial hemp, and enjoy the tropical Belizean jungle. A place where you can discover more ways to use the wisdom of the past to create the solutions for our future, to learn, teach, build, grow, and work together into this new age.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>""THE AFMPPA; Changing the world, one Pirate at a time..""</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are building a self sustained Eco-symbiotic micro society in the jungles of Belize. We want you to join us.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>THE IMPACT</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>      The world of today is suffocated by mans attempts to drag every resource they can out of her. Imagine a society where we live symbiotically with our environment, without living like ""cavemen banging sticks together..."", where paper, lumber, concrete, fuels, fabric, paints, oils, cosmetics, plastics, flours, and much much more can be grown out of the ground with a zero or negative carbon footprint. Where free energy is the bi-product of our commercial and manufacturing processes and is readily available to everyone.</p>
<p>       </p>
<p>      By putting into use a combination of old wisdoms, and new technologies</p>
<p>(Some technology new due to recent development, some due to years of suppression by political and corporate giants in fear of losing control over the industries that made them wealthy), we can work to create a world where, since People produce everything without the help of the state, Governments will be forced to work FOR a truly independent population, and the power will once again rest in the hands of the People, where it belongs. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>      Our goals may be lofty, they may seem unattainable, all our efforts may seem like nothing but droplets in the ocean. But what is an ocean, but a multitude of drops?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>      We have no illusions of some miraculous overnight change, but a shift is occurring. By taking on our shoulders the task of creating a community society, a free republic that works together towards the aforementioned aims, using ancient techniques and understandings combined with actively putting new technologies and developments in agriculture into practice, The Ancient Future Mystery People's Pirate Academy will become a place people can come to learn, teach, create, build, grow, live and learn free. To become a beacon for progress to inspire others to found other communities bound by the common love of liberty and innovation. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>      Once in a while in the stream of life we come across opportunities to become a part of something great in its earliest phase and truly have a hand in its shaping. This is one of those opportunities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>      This community is already in development, we have 41 acres of land in a tropical paradise (Belize), we are building treehouses, geodesic domes, aqua/permaculture gardens, earthships, sustainable energy systems, eating coconuts and mangoes, working hard, and changing the world, one pirate at a time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<strong>WHAT WE HAVE NOW, AND WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR:</strong><p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>          We are working hard all day, every day, to build a sustainable living situation for people to come to and stay and work directly with us. And thanks to a cooperative political climate, we are coordinating with several Ministers in government to establish an industrial hemp industry here in Belize. (Among other things to be revealed as they develop on the AFMPPA facebook page.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The land, connections, vision, passion, good luck, balls, and perseverance to make this happen, but all we need is a small amount of initial funding to allow us to make some big moves quickly, and be ready to have you and others come visit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are looking for: </p>
<p> </p>
<p>$1400 to transport two 4x4 trucks to Belize loaded with all the tools, solar panels, and other supplies and equipments needed to speed up the construction phase. (At the moment it's all hand tools and man power).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>$1000 to buy two 1300 gallon water tanks to store water during the dry season for irrigation and house use. (We can pull water up from a well, but need somewhere to store it for extended periods of time).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>$3000 to form a non-profit corporation, and register it as an NGO (Non-Governmental Organization) in Belize. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>$1000 Food, to feed those helping on the land to build the community structures and gardens etc. (until the gardens begin producing; 4-6 months from end of campaign if successful).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>$600 for the initial seeds and seedlings to plant our gardens, coconut trees, banana trees, etc...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>$1000 to hire a tractor to come out and dig our tilapia pond for the aquaculture irrigation system.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>$1000 to hire some local workers to expedite the clearing of 5 acres to begin preparing the land for cultivating industrial hemp, and pay for the transportation of the first crop of hemp to a state of the art processing location offsite, where our hemp fibre and seeds can be milled down to the micron. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>$1000 to buy mosquito netting, and some materials necessary for waterproofing, and weatherproofing the first living structures"" so that the initial construction crew can sleep out of the rain, and keep all the tools and gear in a dry safe place. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>And by the virtues of indiegogo, if we exceed the amount sought, the possibilities are endless. Before long we could begin acquiring more land into the AFMPPA offshore Trust, to preserve its natural beauty while creating more self sustained living situations, and cultivating more industrial hemp Etc. There is no ceiling. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT YOU GET OUT OF IT:</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>To take part in the birth of a new society and help it grow from a small collective into a worldwide movement. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>To have a place to stay in a self sustained eco-community in a tropical paradise. (So long as you do not violate the terms of the  AFMPPA Articles of Agreement.) </p>
<p> </p>
<p>To be able to certifiably call yourself a Pirate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Weekly updates on the progress of the projects both on site in Belize, and elsewhere the AFMPPA takes root. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>To be able to say things like ... ""I was there when..."", and...""I was in the Academy before it was cool"".</p>
<p> </p>
<p>NOTE: Just FYI, the exchange rate in Belize is 2:1. That is, $1 USD = $2 BZD.  So all contributions will effectively equal double their ammount here in Belize.  If you can only donate a dollar,  it equals two dollars for us here in Belize. Also, paypal is the most convenient way to contribute. If you have a paypall account, we reccomend using it for these ends. Thank you.</p>

We are building a self sustained Eco-symbiotic micro society in the jungles of Belize. We want you to join us.
 
 
 
THE IMPACT
 
      The world of today is suffocated by mans attempts to drag every resource they can out of her. Imagine a society where we live symbiotically with our environment, without living like ""cavemen banging sticks together..."", where paper, lumber, concrete, fuels, fabric, paints, oils, cosmetics, plastics, flours, and much much more can be grown out of the ground with a zero or negative carbon footprint. Where free energy is the bi-product of our commercial and manufacturing processes and is readily available to everyone.
       
      By putting into use a combination of old wisdoms, and new technologies
(Some technology new due to recent development, some due to years of suppression by political and corporate giants in fear of losing control over the industries that made them wealthy), we can work to create a world where, since People produce everything without the help of the state, Governments will be forced to work FOR a truly independent population, and the power will once again rest in the hands of the People, where it belongs. 
 
      Our goals may be lofty, they may seem unattainable, all our efforts may seem like nothing but droplets in the ocean. But what is an ocean, but a multitude of drops?
 
      We have no illusions of some miraculous overnight change, but a shift is occurring. By taking on our shoulders the task of creating a community society, a free republic that works together towards the aforementioned aims, using ancient techniques and understandings combined with actively putting new technologies and developments in agriculture into practice, The Ancient Future Mystery People's Pirate Academy will become a place people can come to learn, teach, create, build, grow, live and learn free. To become a beacon for progress to inspire others to found other communities bound by the common love of liberty and innovation. 
 
      Once in a while in the stream of life we come across opportunities to become a part of something great in its earliest phase and truly have a hand in its shaping. This is one of those opportunities.
 
      This community is already in development, we have 41 acres of land in a tropical paradise (Belize), we are building treehouses, geodesic domes, aqua/permaculture gardens, earthships, sustainable energy systems, eating coconuts and mangoes, working hard, and changing the world, one pirate at a time.
 
 



WHAT WE HAVE NOW, AND WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR:
 
          We are working hard all day, every day, to build a sustainable living situation for people to come to and stay and work directly with us. And thanks to a cooperative political climate, we are coordinating with several Ministers in government to establish an industrial hemp industry here in Belize. (Among other things to be revealed as they develop on the AFMPPA facebook page.)
 
We have:
 
The land, connections, vision, passion, good luck, balls, and perseverance to make this happen, but all we need is a small amount of initial funding to allow us to make some big moves quickly, and be ready to have you and others come visit.
 
We are looking for: 
 
$1400 to transport two 4x4 trucks to Belize loaded with all the tools, solar panels, and other supplies and equipments needed to speed up the construction phase. (At the moment it's all hand tools and man power).
 
$1000 to buy two 1300 gallon water tanks to store water during the dry season for irrigation and house use. (We can pull water up from a well, but need somewhere to store it for extended periods of time).
 
$3000 to form a non-profit corporation, and register it as an NGO (Non-Governmental Organization) in Belize. 
 
$1000 Food, to feed those helping on the land to build the community structures and gardens etc. (until the gardens begin producing; 4-6 months from end of campaign if successful).
 
$600 for the initial seeds and seedlings to plant our gardens, coconut trees, banana trees, etc...
 
$1000 to hire a tractor to come out and dig our tilapia pond for the aquaculture irrigation system.
 
$1000 to hire some local workers to expedite the clearing of 5 acres to begin preparing the land for cultivating industrial hemp, and pay for the transportation of the first crop of hemp to a state of the art processing location offsite, where our hemp fibre and seeds can be milled down to the micron. 
 
$1000 to buy mosquito netting, and some materials necessary for waterproofing, and weatherproofing the first living structures"" so that the initial construction crew can sleep out of the rain, and keep all the tools and gear in a dry safe place. 
 
And by the virtues of indiegogo, if we exceed the amount sought, the possibilities are endless. Before long we could begin acquiring more land into the AFMPPA offshore Trust, to preserve its natural beauty while creating more self sustained living situations, and cultivating more industrial hemp Etc. There is no ceiling. 
 
WHAT YOU GET OUT OF IT:
 
To take part in the birth of a new society and help it grow from a small collective into a worldwide movement. 
 
To have a place to stay in a self sustained eco-community in a tropical paradise. (So long as you do not violate the terms of the  AFMPPA Articles of Agreement.) 
 
To be able to certifiably call yourself a Pirate.
 
Weekly updates on the progress of the projects both on site in Belize, and elsewhere the AFMPPA takes root. 
 
To be able to say things like ... ""I was there when..."", and...""I was in the Academy before it was cool"".
 
NOTE: Just FYI, the exchange rate in Belize is 2:1. That is, $1 USD = $2 BZD.  So all contributions will effectively equal double their ammount here in Belize.  If you can only donate a dollar,  it equals two dollars for us here in Belize. Also, paypal is the most convenient way to contribute. If you have a paypall account, we reccomend using it for these ends. Thank you.
 
 
OTHER WAYS TO TAKE PART:
 
      We are aware that some who wish to join in and become involved may not be in a position to do so financially, but never fear, there there are many other ways contribute. Here's a few:

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Bill Baue (author of the first Walmart Sustainability Report in 2007) and I, Tom O'Malley (Technologist) saw a demo of some software late last year that blew our minds.  In seconds, it was possible to compare entire industries for their Environmental, Social, and Governance performance, all in very easy-to-understand graphs that display absolute results and results normalized to revenue.  The owner of the software did not fully understand what they had, but Bill and I did.  We knew it had to be open to all and free.  So we contracted for the use of the software and plan to fund it by sponsors, once we get it live.  In order to make it live, we need a some start-up funds.  Thats where you can play a role.  Please help make this much needed market disrupter come to life and bring unprecedented transparency to major global industries.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div>
<div>We need bout 5k in database and front end development to make live and then another 5k to update 3 existing industries (~75 companies) and then another 5k to add 2 new industries....we will then have 5 industries completely built out.</div>
<div>This funding will ensure the app goes live mid June and that more content is added by end of July.</div>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
Though many companies report their Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) impact (about 5000), it's tough to compare performance across industry as the information often buried in sustainability reports coated in marketing jargon. What's more, the data is often reported in different units, and is sometimes calculated differently.  We make all the data easily comparable in standard units, in pretty graphs, and relative to the size of the company.  This apples-to-apples comparison in real time has never been available without paying big bucks to Bloomberg et.al., making it really hard for many to bring real context to ESG Reports.  OUR PROJECT IS A DISRUPTIVE FORCE that will improve the visibility to companies, investors, activists, employees, and consumers of the relative impact companies make.</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
Please pass this on to multiple people who might be incented to drive free intelligent transparency into the market place.</div></div>","Short Summary

Well I don't want to be just another failed dreamer-- I want to <i>do </i>something about it. The state of this world isn't going to change unless more people get up, make an effort, and follow through on what they believe in. I believe that the tropical rainforests of Central and South America are worth preserving. Hopefully you do too.<br/></p><p>Please help me raise funds to go to Central America and get hands-on experience on how to help this endangered ecosystem. Currently, I am working towards a double major in Environmental Science: Ecological Restoration and Environmental Management and Protection: Natural Resources Planning.

Not only will I be gaining the tools with which to advocate for rainforest preservation, but I will be doing practical conservation work on this very trip. To save the rainforest, all sorts of people are needed. People who have the funds to help from home (you), people that have the knowledge and time to help on site (my goal), people that have the mindset to help at the market (buyers of sustainably sourced goods), ect, ect, ect. Everyone can help. If more people were to learn about the rainforest -- what it is, what it does for us, what is happening to it -- I believe more people would believe that this is a cause worth helping. Please, encourage anyone you know to do a simple google search on rainforest destruction and read one of the articles that comes up; do it yourself even. In the search I just conducted, the very first site says, ""one and one-half acres of rainforest are lost every second"" and that ""experts estimate that we are losing 137 plant, animal and insect species every single day due to rainforest
deforestation."" 50,000 species a year. Rainforests are home to over half of the world's ~10 million species, and they're dying. Yet, rainforests and the biodiversity within provide us so very many benefits. They give us more than 20% of our oxygen, 20% of our fresh water, 25% of Western pharmaceuticals, 60% of our diet. The U.S. National Cancer Institute has identified approximately 3,000 plants that are active against cancer cells -- 70% of which are only found in the rainforest. The tropical rainforest is absolutely  necessary. Yet some people just don't <i>see. </i>Please help me help them see.</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe border=""0"" height=""326"" src=""https://media.embed.ly/1/frame?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DbYAZ3NWVgtc&amp;width=580&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;height=326&amp;secure=true"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><blockquote><br/></blockquote><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>If you can not provide money right now, I completely understand.

I want to change the world. Sounds cliche doesn't it? Well I don't want to be just another failed dreamer-- I want to do something about it. The state of this world isn't going to change unless more people get up, make an effort, and follow through on what they believe in. I believe that the tropical rainforests of Central and South America are worth preserving.

Fauna in Focus is a new environmental awareness project for northwest Cambodia. Born from the 2011 award-winning Nosy Maitso film, we are setting out to produce an educational video on wildlife conservation in Cambodia.

Our Cambodian Nature Film will introduce Cambodia's unique biodiversity and will teach audiences about sustainable conservation and community conservation projects around the country.

The film will be narrated entirely in the native Khmer language, with English subtitles, and will be distributed freely online, as well as to thousands of local schools, NGO projects, rural communities and conservation organizations working in the region.


You can help! Wild animals and ecosystems in Cambodia are vanishing. With your support we can bring engaging environmental education to the people who matter most, and change their perceptions towards wildlife and conservation.

Become a part of wildlife conservation in Cambodia!



Cambodia's unique biodiversity is facing many threats from illegal logging and hunting, to unsustainable agriculture. From big cats to vultures, the unique biodiversity of Cambodia is in trouble, but you can do something about it! 
Your donations will:



Raise awareness and appreciation of Cambodia's unique biodiversity.

Improve local knowledge of conservation projects and sustainable practices.

Help reach audiences across the country and around the world.





A small donation can go a long way in Cambodia!

Fauna in Focus hopes to raise $15,000 to make a film unlike anything ever made for Cambodian audiences! To make this film a reality we need film assistants, field guides, equipment and expeditions to film in some of the most remote and unexplored regions of the country.


$5,200 : Staff - For filming and production over a 6 month period we need translators, a director/editor, a local film assistant and the occasional forest ranger or camera crew!

$2,700 : Equipment - A new zoom lens, two new microphones, a new slider and hopefully a DJI Phantom Pro 3!

$4,000 : Expeditions - Our team will visit community forests and conservation projects throughout northwest Cambodia, from Tonle Sap Lake and Phnom Kulen National Park, to the dry forests of Preah Vihear and Oddar Meanchey province.

The Fauna in Focus team

Producing the film will be a collaborative effort between numerous biologists and filmmakers working in Cambodia. The project will also provide jobs for local field guides, film assistants and translators. Fauna in Focus is partnering with existing organizations like the Wildlife Conservation Society, Birdlife International, and Wildlife Alliance to highlight the important work they do. The project director, Daniel Roper-Jones, is a primatologist, environmental educator and filmmaker who has lived in Cambodia for over two years. While working in Madagascar he produced an educational film called Nosy Maitso which received an award from the International Wildlife Film Festival in 2011. The Cambodian Nature Film will be even better!

<h3><strong>Challenge!</strong></h3>
<p>You know the challenge now:</p>
<p>As of today, too few cities are reaping the insane benefits from recycling their organic waste. In 2013, most cities around the world have yet to take advantage of their “waste”. Organic waste often accounts for more than two thirds of the total waste landfilled.</p>
<p><img alt=""City"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/725847/pictures/full/20130326200245-City.png?1364353369"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""City""/></p>
<p>When food waste is disposed in a landfill, it rots and becomes a major source of methane – a potent greenhouse gas with more than 20 times the global warming potential of CO2. In the US, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that diverting organic waste from landfills will avoid 6.3 million metric tons of methane per year in the country, the equivalent of keeping 24 million cars off the road each year!<br/><em><br/>(Yes, that’s scary… Level 3 – What’s your reaction?

<h3><strong>In the Driver’s Seat…</strong></h3>
<p>In the driver’s seat: Local governments. They need our help! It’s time to start cashing in that treasure that keeps building on.</p>
<p>It's much easier for municipalities to make things happen if they get clear answers to all the legitimate questions they ask themselves:</p>

<p><strong>And that’s the problem:</strong> Most cities don’t know the answers to those questions:  Nobody is knocking on their door to bring them up to speed. So they do nothing, but the clock is ticking.</p>
<h3><strong>Waving a Magic Wand?</strong></h3>
<p>Ok, so we need to help local governments understand what they can do with organic waste, and urgently at that. Fortunately, there is a lot of knowledge in the field already and enough success stories. The problem is that it’s quite difficult (even discouraging) for a project team who is getting started to access proper content on the topic. The existing knowledge could be much better packaged and distributed, using the digital formats we can leverage today.<br/><br/><strong>That’s the big idea: </strong>The best knowledge in the field needs to be turn-key, on-demand, and only one click-away from anyone anywhere. And it shouldn’t cost anything, so everyone can understand the basics and get the big picture. Makes sense?</p>
<p>This is where we step in! <br/><strong>Our expertise is in Digital Media &amp; Education </strong>and today we are in the position of catering to this global need.</p>

<h2>Aromaste' Clinical Aromatherapy</h2>
<h3>Kate O'Hara, Clinical Aromatherapist, Essential Oil Educator</h3>
<p>I am the owner of a small Aromatherapy business in the beautiful Finger Lakes Region of Upstate New York. Passionate about alternative healthcare and concerned for my health and the health of my family, I decided to obtain a formal education in Aromatherapy. I graduated from the Aromahead Institute of Essential Oil Studies in Ithaca, NY as a Nationally Certified Clinical Aromatherapist and wish to share my expertise with all who wish to empower themselves. The entrepreneur in me is looking to continue creating my gorgeous 100% VEGAN product line in order that others may benefit from Aromatherapy as I have. I am a stay at home mother of four beautiful children who were my inspiration at the beginning of this journey. In searching for alternative health care I was introduced to essential oils. I intially used them to treat my own anxiety and then I used them to eliminate allergies and help with skin conditions my children had been dealing with. They were so effective I wanted to study essential oil chemistry and learn as much as I could. This began my passion and led me to persue this dream. This business provides a unique service to those seeking environmentally friendly products that are good for our bodies and our environment. All classes will be offered on a sliding scale in order that this information is accessible to everyone. My therapeutic essential oil product line that is 100% VEGAN will be available to help all via my website this fall. My dream is to expand this business from beyond trade shows and craft fairs. My desire is to offer custom therapeutic consultations and workshops. I have paid for my education and financed my business start-up with small business loans thus far. I need your help to allow me to purchase ethically sourced essential oils on a larger scale. They can be quite expensive. I really wish to expand my product line, teach more classes and bring this amazing healing art to all. Thank You. In exchange for your generous contribution I am offering amazing perks.</p>

<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>We stand at a critical moment in Earth's history, a time when 
humanity must choose its future. As the world becomes increasingly 
interdependent and fragile, the future at once holds great peril and 
great promise. To move forward we must recognize that in the midst of a 
magnificent diversity of cultures and life forms we are one human family
 and one Earth community with a common destiny. We must join together to
 bring forth a sustainable global society founded on respect for nature,
 universal human rights, economic justice, and a culture of peace. 
Towards this end, it is imperative that we, the peoples of Earth, 
declare our responsibility to one another, to the greater community of 
life, and to future generations. <br/><br/></p>
<p><strong>Earth, Our Home</strong></p>
Humanity is part of a vast evolving universe. Earth, our home, is 
alive with a unique community of life. The forces of nature make 
existence a demanding and uncertain adventure, but Earth has provided 
the conditions essential to life's evolution. The resilience of the 
community of life and the well-being of humanity depend upon preserving a
 healthy biosphere with all its ecological systems, a rich variety of 
plants and animals, fertile soils, pure waters, and clean air. The 
global environment with its finite resources is a common concern of all 
peoples. The protection of Earth's vitality, diversity, and beauty is a 
sacred trust.

of haves without the not's. A world of abundance without the lack. A world of

<h3>Why are we here?!</h3>
<p>This campaign is a little gift to a great person.<br/>I never thought that one day I would meet one of my heroes, and so I'd love to give this moment an even greater meaning. <strong>On October 15, Serj Tankian will be playing in Milan, Italy.</strong> I've bought a special ticket that should grant me access to the backstage and a little chat with Serj. Thinking about what I could do or say to him, in order not to seem dull, this idea came up:</p>
<ul>
<li>I scream in a System of a down/Serj Tankian tribute band called <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/toxiciteam.soaditalia"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Toxiciteam"">Toxiciteam</a>.</li>
<li>Sometimes I help a Swiss humanitarian organization called <a href=""http://www.esperance-acti.org/index.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Espérance Acti"">Espérance Acti</a>.</li>
<li>If there's one thing I learned from Serj Tankian, is to love and help other people.</li>
</ul>
<p>So we (the team and me) connected the dots and here we are. <strong>We'd love to give Serj's name to a well in South Vietnam</strong>, in order to <strong>give water to, at least, 45 people</strong> who need it.</p>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<h3>What are YOU doing here?!</h3>
<p><strong>Espérance Acti</strong> needs <strong>300 CHF (nearly $320 or €250)</strong> in order to project, build and manage a well. With every single dollar you give, you're participating in a simple but lifechanging and lifesaving project, in Serj's name.<br/>If we reach the goal, a new well will be built, and I will smile to Serj Tankian while presenting him the result of this campaign. We're sure it would be a <em><strong>little</strong> </em>surprise to him (and I've always thought that surprises are the true spring of pure joy) and that he would appreciate your effort in this.<br/>Each and every extra dollar (apart from those covering Indiegogo fees, shipping and production costs) will go into other Espérance Acti projects, like building schools or bridges (8000 CHF for a little bridge, something more for a school, how far do you think we could go?!).</p>
</div>
<h3>What do you get?!</h3>
<p><em>If you're here, you already have our gratitude</em>, but we'd love <strong>to be sure you get what you deserve</strong>, for helping us trying to make this world a better place. Here <strong>on the right you can see a list of gifts</strong> that will state that you took part in this little but great project. And here's what happens when the campaign ends:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>All fundings will go to Espérance Acti</strong>, in order to build a well (or two, or more!!).</li>
<li>We'll ship you or contact you in order to personally give you your gifts.</li>
<li>You'll show off your philanthropy with stickers, caps and t-shirts. When people will see you and ask you ""<em>what's that?!</em>"", you'll have a great story to tell and <strong>much love will be given to you</strong> :).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<p>We know that showing off what you do with your hearth is not the right thing, but we think that <strong>this would just be a way to get people involved and aware</strong> of how much you can change the world with so little effort.<br/>We know that the perks are high, but here's how we calculated the levels:<br/>gadget production cost + shipping + 10 dollars to Espérance Acti</p>
<h3>You don't have money?!</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>We know this is not a great moment, for a fundraising campaign, and the way Indiegogo works is why we're almost at ease asking you money (we'd never do that). You can make the difference just <strong>spreading the word on the internet and in real life</strong>:</p>

<p>The Lookout Mountain Conservancy was founded in 1991 as a way to help protect the natural beauty on Chattanooga's iconic mountain.  Our mission is to protect Lookout Mountain's scenic, historic, and ecological resources through conservation, advocacy, recreation and education, for current and future generations.  Lookout Mountain spans Tennessee, Georgia, and Alabama with its 93 miles.  This 1 mile-long connector trail is the missing piece that will create 140 miles of continuous trail.  </p>
<p>This conservancy is dedicated to community engagement, we like to get the people out to the land!  Five years ago, a partnership was formed with The Howard School.  The freshman come out to the land for experiential learning opportunities, and all students are welcome to apply to the Howard Intern and Leadership Program.  The LMC is able to hire young men and women from The Howard School to maintain the trails and the land of the Conservation.  Doing so allows these students to gain a job (something that is very hard to do as a 14 or 15 year old), learn job skills, and have greater financial stability.  The staff of the LMC are dedicated to offering support year round to the students, encouraging them to stay in school, connecting them with internship opportunities and resources, and giving a listening ear when needed.</p>
<p>This trail will be built over the two weeks of their winter break.  This will not only provide them with a full time job over winter break, but will help keep them busy, and help them learn new skills as they will be joining a professional trail builder. </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>EVERY DOLLAR WILL BE MATCHED up to $9000!!! Help us reach our goal!</strong></p>

<p>The funds for this campaign will pay for the contracted professional trail builder, the supplies, and will help towards paying the students.  </p>

<p><strong>Locations such as Cairns, Orange,
Burnie, Victoria, Adelaide and Darwin in Australia are set to become major mining centres as
Global Aquatica has solved major road blocks to mining in those areas, opening them up to extensive resource development
and employment.</strong></p>
<p>Global
Aquatica has developed technology that is proven to remove the acid mine
drainage pollution caused by mines and is campaigning through
this crowdfunding site for funds to build scaling plants. These areas have
abundant valuable mineral resources, however, they cannot be mined due to the
contamination of the rainfall. </p>
<p>Unfortunately,
all the minerals in these areas exist in sulphide rock that turns the rain
into sulphuric acid called acid mine drainage. The acid dissolves the metals in
the rock into the water resulting in toxic water that cannot be released to the
environment. The mines quickly become inundated with lakes of sulphuric acid they
cannot get rid of and are abandoned. Currently, the treatment costs are
prohibitive, preventing mining from proceeding.</p>
<p><b>Global Aquatica is the only company in the world that can
totally remove acid mine drainage pollution.</b><br/></p>
<p>Using our
ground breaking, patent technology, Global Aquatica converts the contaminants
into valuable resources for use by the global electronics and high technology
industries. Essentially, we are mining the acid mine drainage. The sulphuric
acid is converted into high quality water which can be used by agriculture or the
mines for low cost processing. The mining costs are slashed, the environment is
protected, abundant high quality water is available and mining brings high,
long term employment to these local areas.</p>
<p>We intend
'mining' the acid mine drainage from the existing and abandoned mines in the areas
of Cairns, Mt Isa, Orange, Central Victoria, Western Tasmania, Adelaide and
Darwin, creating new long term mining centres. It will also significantly
reduce operating costs at the existing mines and open up 50% more mineral
wealth to Australia and globally, previously inaccessible.</p>
<p>Global
Aquatica intends commencing operations in the mines and also starting
construction of local extractive metallurgy plants and regional engineering offices
in each area within 2 years. As Global Aquatica's policy is to purchase locally, we will be starting with the communities where we receive the most support. <br/></p>
<p>Global
Aquatica’s engineers have already proven the technology and it has been
extensively used on sites around the world. The next step is to assess the
process by treating each type of pollution at each abandoned mine. Global Aquatica
intend placing scaling plants on each site, after which the mines have
indicated they will purchase a full size plant. Global Aquatica will then
commence operations in each area, resulting in a mining boom in each area that will
result in significant long term employment growth.</p>
<p>Three of Global
Aquatica’s engineers formed the company to ensure the technology is available
after their coal mine industry parent company closed. Global Aquatica has
launched this crowd funding campaign to empower the local communities to improve
their economies by funding the construction of the scaling plants. Once these
have assessed the technology on each site, the mining companies will fund full
size plants, kicking regional resource development in that area into high gear. Donations
are needed to fund the construction of the plants. </p>

<h3>The Colores del Priorat Project</h3>
<p>My name is Sara Dochow. I have an MFA in painting from Portland State University, Portland, OR. This project involves working with flora from the Montsant and Priorat regions of Catalunya, in Spain. It is the anti-Monsanto campaign, focusing on sustainable, environmentally conscious practice, while cataloging results and gathering local lore. Contributions would help fund research and development, specifically a written account of the project.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am one year in to this project. Contributions would go towards an official catalog/research journal to be developed as a book, developing and experimenting with flora to create the Priorat Paintbox, gathering local lore regarding flora as dyestuff. I am looking to fund a years worth of research and development, materials costs, enlisting local youth in the discovery process, with an agent already on line to work with me into generating a text. If I don't reach my full goal, I will use whatever funds this idea generates to continue the project. Please see my perks below for a wide range of contribution options.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are living in a world where the chemical dominates. My question is, how do we use the resources available without negative impact to our environment? I am working with winemakers who use biodynamic and organic practices, extracting unique colors from each vineyard, as well as harvesting flora throughout the area. The enotourism in the Priorat would be enhanced by another view of what this region offers. Unique colors, unique to the Montsant. This project is a model for regional explorations. If you are a champion for the environment, support the arts and crafstmanship, and love color, join me in this project.</p>

<p>We think it's time to <strong>rethink</strong> development in Palestinian refugee communities, and that means <strong>green</strong>, <strong>sustainable</strong>, and <strong>grassroots</strong> solutions.</p>
<p>Refutrees has developed 3 innovative projects, and our dream is to raise <strong>$30,000</strong> for the development of each of them as the first step towards a sustainable and green future for displaced communities.<br/><br/></p>
<h2><strong>THE SEEDS: Our Story<br/></strong></h2>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>Refutrees</strong> was born after years of research conducted by founder Lamya Hussain in Palestinian refugee camps across the West Bank and Lebanon. Through her work, Lamya was able to identify the failure of current development and aid programs to <strong>end donor-reliance</strong>. Further, Lamya’s research identified the gaps in building local livelihoods for Palestinian refugees in the long-term.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">In an effort to address these issues of unemployment, lack of land and food sovereignty, and deteriorating community health, Refutrees was created in order to integrate green innovation with the development of projects fundamentally based on the needs of local communities in <strong>collaboration</strong> with <strong>local resources</strong>. With a small dedicated team made up of Lamya, Pauline, Theo, Shatha, and Bridie (read more about us below!), a wealth of research, and endless amount of hope, Refutrees is now ready to grow its seeds!</p>
<h2><strong>THE SPROUTS: Our Plan </strong></h2>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">We have 3 interconnected, extensively researched pilot projects (detailed below): <strong>the Rooftop Garden Project, the Agro-Knowledge Exchange, </strong>and<strong> Eco-Art Palestine.</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Each project responds to the needs of Palestinian refugees by developing local capacities in the long-term by incorporating community aspirations and principles. Our ideas are <strong>eco-friendly, sustainable and replicable</strong>, and rooted in helping Palestinian communities achieve their socio-economic and human rights.</p>
<p><img alt=""close up image of olive branch"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img825.imageshack.us/img825/2427/eke4.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin: 3px;""/></p>
<h2><strong>THE WATER AND SUN: Your Help<br/></strong></h2>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Our pilot projects <strong>each</strong> require $10,000 from start to finish, for a total of <strong>$30,000</strong>. Our budget is made up of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cost of materials</li>
<li>Consultancy charges,</li>
<li>Travel, administrative and legal costs.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Any left over funds, if any, will be used to produce locally made merchandise such as t-shirts and tote bags, as a means of continuing our fundraising efforts after this campaign is over.</p>

<h2><strong>THE ROOTS: The Background </strong></h2>
<p>Displaced for over <strong>four decades</strong>, Palestinian refugees remain in a state of ‘temporary’ with limited access to resources, restricted mobility, and uncountable barriers to livelihood. While Palestinians have continued to find innovative ways to maintain their communities and spirit, the daily struggles around <strong>health, environment and livelihood</strong> have been key motivations in establishing Refutrees. Living conditions are poor and include: poor diet and nutrition, access to clean drinking water, sanitation and sewage, garbage disposal and poor overall environment, security and safe spaces for children, and so on. Existing local capabilities continue to be exhausted, and Palestinians remain skeptical of the donor programs that have thus far failed to resolve the roots of their current circumstances. Nonetheless, Palestinians remain resilient and continue to identify with innovative solutions towards the gaps in development in their communities -- amongst which are green solutions with a sustainable future. </p>
<p>In creating projects that are reflective of the needs of the community in a manner that is creative, eco-friendly and premised on the dissemination of knowledge and resource building, Refutrees is hoping to work collobaratively with local communities to create grassroots change. <br/><br/></p>
<h2><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>The Pilot Projects:</strong></span></h2>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://imageshack.us/a/img706/3713/yl7b.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2>1. The <strong>Rooftop Garden Project</strong>
</h2>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>PROBLEM =</strong> Donor reliance, deteriorating health, and lack of food sovereignty. Palestinian refugees, as the longest standing refugee community in the world, continue to be reliant on international humanitarian assistance programs in such a way that restricts their independent development.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>SOLUTION =</strong> Rooftop gardens that provide Palestinians the capacity to grown their own organic food in dense and restrictive spaces. The rooftop garden addresses the lowering health status of Palestinian refugees by getting to the root of the problem: access to good food. More importantly, it is both sustainable and reflective of Palestinian socio-economic and political rights. Furthermore, it is an investment into the continually deteriorating environment of the camps given poor infrastructure, lack of permits for repairs, and vulnerability to systematic violence.</p>
<p>Most of the refugees we will work with were previously landowners and farmers, which gives the project an even more important dimension. In aiming to adapt to their current context while also reviving farming concepts in the urban context, Refutrees will engage second and third generation refugees with the roof-top garden project by providing training and assistance.</p>
<h2>2. <strong>Agro-Knowledge Exchange </strong>
</h2>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>PROBLEM =</strong> Even under highly restrictive circumstances, Palestinian communities are truly innovative and creative. However, lack of resources and other structural barriers to education and enterprise stand in the way of the long term development of community innovation and capacity building.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>SOLUTION =</strong> Refutrees is rooted in the principles of resource-sharing and the exchange of knowledge, and all our projects are developed with the intention of being replicable and sustainable. The Agro-Knowledge Exchange program is one such way to do this, as it aims to connect Palestinian refugees with scholarship opportunities abroad to explore agricultural, environmental and social enterprise studies and programs. In collaboration with Palestinian communities, Refutrees will carefully select enthusiastic individuals that are community leaders and innovative thinkers that will ensure the continuity of projects such as the rooftop gardens.</p>
<p>We are working with potential universities that might be interested in sponsoring Palestinian refugees in short and long-term scholarship programs. Given the unique context of Palestinian refugees it is important to invest in the training and development of such capacities to improve current and future living conditions. <br/><br/></p>
<h2><strong>3. Eco-Art Palestine</strong></h2>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>PROBLEM =</strong> Palestinian children, particularly refugees, are the most vulnerable to systematic violence and arbitrary detention under their circumstances. Lack of  safe playing spaces means that Palestinian children are consistently denied of not only special protection, but their basic right to play, in accordance with Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>SOLUTION =</strong> An eco-art playground made of recycled materials. In partnership with Ugandan eco-artist Ruganzu Bruno Tusingwire, he project addresses the issue of limited access for children to play. In designing a playground that is eco-friendly and utilizes recycled material, Refutrees is consistent in its approach to intertwine art-creativity-environmental awareness. This space will be unique, replicable for future projects, and will have a real impact on the community. Also, in a truly sustainable fashion, we will work with local artists and hold workshops to build capacity for future projects.</p>
<p>Tusinwire's project will be based on his design of a community amusement park made of recycled materials in Uganda, which won him the 2012 TEDxSummit Award.</p>

<p> </p></span></div>","THE DREAM:
We think it's time to rethink development in Palestinian refugee communities, and that means green, sustainable, and grassroots solutions.
Refutrees has developed 3 innovative projects, and our dream is to raise $30,000 for the development of each of them as the first step towards a sustainable and green future for displaced communities.
THE SEEDS: Our Story
Refutrees was born after years of research conducted by founder Lamya Hussain in Palestinian refugee camps across the West Bank and Lebanon. Through her work, Lamya was able to identify the failure of current development and aid programs to end donor-reliance. Further, Lamya’s research identified the gaps in building local livelihoods for Palestinian refugees in the long-term.
In an effort to address these issues of unemployment, lack of land and food sovereignty, and deteriorating community health, Refutrees was created in order to integrate green innovation with the development of projects fundamentally based on the needs of local communities in collaboration with local resources. With a small dedicated team made up of Lamya, Pauline, Theo, Shatha, and Bridie (read more about us below!), a wealth of research, and endless amount of hope, Refutrees is now ready to grow its seeds!
THE SPROUTS: Our Plan 
We have 3 interconnected, extensively researched pilot projects (detailed below): the Rooftop Garden Project, the Agro-Knowledge Exchange, and Eco-Art Palestine.
Each project responds to the needs of Palestinian refugees by developing local capacities in the long-term by incorporating community aspirations and principles. Our ideas are eco-friendly, sustainable and replicable, and rooted in helping Palestinian communities achieve their socio-economic and human rights.

THE WATER AND SUN: Your Help
Our pilot projects each require $10,000 from start to finish, for a total of $30,000. Our budget is made up of:

Cost of materials
Consultancy charges,
Travel, administrative and legal costs.

Any left over funds, if any, will be used to produce locally made merchandise such as t-shirts and tote bags, as a means of continuing our fundraising efforts after this campaign is over.
We have planned our funding campaign in such a way that allows our three  projects to help each other through a growing network and wellspring of resources. This allows us also to move forward even if we (heaven forbid!) don’t reach our $30,000 goal – all the money raised will go directly to starting up the projects as well as help us explore other fundraising avenues.

We want you to feel all the love that's going into these projects. To thank you for your support, we have an amazing set of thank you gifts -- ""perks"" for your generosity!  Here are some of the highlights from our friends!

We Need Your Help:


Water
     is URGENTLY NEEDED in the outer islands of Kiribati, where many islands were awash with sea water from Cyclone Pam's king tides, devastating their drinking wells for
     the next 15 years.




Shipping is costly due to the remoteness of the Kiribati islands. We are looking to raise $7,000 AUD, to ship medical supplies and bulk water. 

Please, next time you are out having a drink with friends, donate the value
     of one round of drinks, so Kiribati children can drink safe clean water.    



What You Get:


We
     will send you an Island Hero certificate recognizing your
     support plus a link to a virtual holiday in the stunning Kiribati
     islands. 
Or
     for more substantial donations you can choose a perk of a Lifestraw
     personal water filter or a solar light. 
You
     may feel a warm glow inside knowing you have made a significant difference
     to the lives of these children.

                      
Cyclone Pam's fierce winds whipped up high waves that battered the tiny Pacific islands of Kiribati, flooding and damaging the Betio Hospital, the crucial inter island causeway, thousands of homes and the all important protective sea walls!
Salty sea water flooded 50% of the island land area, devastating many water wells and essential food crops like breadfruit, bab-bai (like taro) and coconut trees.
Half of this nations population are displaced and living with extreme shortages of safe clean water with severely limited food options. 




The Island Rescue Projects' volunteers do not earn wages. Our overheads or operating fees are minimal. We take your donation right to where it is needed. 
# Make a donation to help us reach $7,000 When we reach our target I will post a bizarre video clip where I drink dirty horse poop water!  


          

                                              
           1 out of every 20 babies do not survive early childhood in Kiribati. 

            
Our Impact:

Our project has been successfully instrumental in saving the lives of young babies, as well as helping children and adults with health issues.

Last November we donated 2 rain water tanks to Teaoraereke Village after their wells were ruined with sea water flooding over 100 homes.
In December of last year we participated in screening young babies and children for incidences of malnutrition on Tarawa
In January we donated 3 rain water tanks to villages on Marakei Island and supplied various medicines for everyday illnesses. There are no pharmacies on the islands.

<p>The Budget of the project is around 15 000€, the

expensive because of the quantity of machines that we want to build in order to
have an impact on many communities. As all these installations are given to
them, we have to finance the whole equipment needed for the construction of the
machines. So an amount of 1000€ would be already a great help; it could help us
for example to buy wood, glass or screws. </p>

project is useful for them is really a motivation for us to continue the
momentum.</p>
<p>We stay in touch with the Mexicans thanks to a monthly
skype with the president of the association Nana Ximhai, which is committed to
the environment. We have got a partnership with this association which allows
us to have the viewpoints on the everyday life in these Mexican communities. So
that we focus on what really matters for them.</p>
<p>And this year we are giving the project another
dimension; we are developing two others installations: solar showers and dry
toilets. Mexicans submit us these demands in order to save energy and water.</p>
<p>We also have a new partnership with Mexico City

<h3>OUR STORY:</h3>
<p>My husband and I are humbly seeking donations to help us build an off-the-grid cabin in Kentucky and rebuild our farm.  <br/><br/>In August we were forced off the farm where we'd been living - the farm primarily featured in the above video - and found ourselves without money and without a place to go. We poured hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars into starting a garden we now have to completely walk away from, and chalk up to a loss; a loss of nearly everything we had. Thanks to a generous offer from our mentors and fellow farmers at <a href=""http://www.bugtusslefarm.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bugtussle Farm</a>, however, we now have a plot of land in Southern Kentucky - back on the farm where we interned and fell in love with farming <strong>and</strong> with each other. But as wonderful as our new land is, it is not farmable yet and needs <strong>a tremendous amount</strong> of work and most glaringly... it does not have a house. We need to get back on our feet, and now with the land to do so, all we lack is the shelter! <br/><br/>All of our savings were invested in that farm and garden - all of our wedding money and everything we earned growing vegetables this year. Your donations will give us a literal roof over our heads, but ultimately help to replant the healthy farmstead we lost.</p>
<p>We follow only organic and biodynamic practices in our gardens. We do not use chemicals or commercial fertilizers of any kind, nor antibiotics or synthetic medicine to treat our animals. We do not grow anything genetically modified and take great pride in saving heirloom seeds and promoting diversity. Through even a small donation, by giving us a chance to rebuild, you are effectively helping to get <a href=""http://www.roughdraftfarmstead.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Rough Draft Farmstead</a> back to doing what it does best: farm healthfully.  </p>

<p>We don't endeavor to build anything  extravagant––the design we have in mind is roughly 750 square feet, solar-powered and wood-heated. By our estimation (with the help of some friends more experienced in building cabins), we believe the structure itself will cost between $5,500 and $6,500....but being amateurs, that's probably a low estimate.</p>
<p>We plan on doing this pretty much <strong>by ourselves.</strong> Not only will this save us money, but it will give us the experience of building our own home, designed for our lives and built to have as little impact on the land as possible. In return for your donations, we plan on fervently documenting the entire building process on our <a href=""http://www.roughdraftfarmstead.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">blog</a>. We personally love following along with stories of those building off-the-grid cabins, and can only hope that our journey will inspire and educate others in the same way. We only wish to build a place for us to live so we may restart the farm we lost and once again provide healthy food to a small community - your donations help make that possible  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Anyone interested in helping out in a more <strong>tangible</strong> way is welcome to pitch in! We need all the help we can get! We plan on hosting a few work parties....and you can surely expect a homegrown meal and maybe even some homemade wine in return!</p>
<p>Any extra money from this campaign would go toward things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wiring the cabin for solar electricity, preparing for when we can one day afford the panels and inverter.</li>
<li>A water system - either a pump for the old well existing on the property or a way to utilize a nearby natural spring.</li>
<li>A wood stove for heat/cooking.</li>
<li>Simply getting us back on our feet - we invested and <em>lost</em> <strong>everything</strong> in our first farm! Extra funds could buy things like seeds, tools for clearing the land, and money for restoring an old barn on the property.</li>

With bulldozers poised to take what little remains of their ancestral forest, tribal elders say their best hope is to hold a ceremony that since ancient times has been used to resolve difficult disputes and highly charged situations with great power. Because all people of the earth need the rainforest for their oxygen, tribal leaders invite you to support this ancient vow ceremony (called <i>Sumpah Adat</i>) to protect their forest — for everyone's sake. </p><p>For the Dayak Benuaq, humans have a sacred contract to nurture and sustain life — it is why we were put on the earth. Their assignment as a tribe is to care for this particular rainforest. To stay in touch with this role and united in their efforts, they have always relied on ceremony. This is how they connect with each other and with the larger cosmic forces as they tune into something bigger and more fulfilling than their personal security and comfort.<span><br/></span> <br/></p><p></p><p><b>Unlike Western methods of negotiation, their ceremonial method of conflict resolution taps into the heart and the big picture, </b>where all involved examine their part in the conflict, reconnect to their true values and recommit to their original purpose as humans: to keep the earth in balance. The 64-day ceremony will address tensions with four neighboring villages over disputed land by creating an opportunity to inquire deeply, celebrate and feast together. The tribe will also invite company and government officials to join in this process, though tribal elders say their cooperation is not necessary for the ceremony to correct things. </p><p>Your participation will add power to the ceremony by extending it across the globe and may help avert violence and direct confrontation between the companies and the local people. We believe that the power of our intentions working together, with a willingness to engage the company and government officials who we will encourage to attend, can change some minds and hearts on both sides of the globe so that the remaining forest can be preserved.<span><br/><a href=""http://flamingseed.com/why-a-ceremony-is-the-most-practical-way-to-stop-bulldozers-from-destroying-the-rainforest/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Skeptical?

As the tribe nurtures the seedlings of these now endangered trees to replant in degraded forest areas, palm oil companies push into these same forests with their bulldozers and the land goes into dispute. The decisions made by officials over disputed land have resulted in the loss of large portions of Muara Tae forest without the consent of the tribe, and compensation offered after bulldozing is absurdly small. While NGOs continue to work hard through all of this to help, without sufficient attention from rest of the world, the Muara Tae forest continues to vanish with alarming speed. <span></span><span></span><b><br/><br/>Smart phones and gold</b> — As if this weren't enough, with our new smartphones and laptops in need of precious metals, a mining company suspects there is gold under Muara Tae village and wants to literally dig their homes out from under them to get to it, with the promise of dangerous mining jobs in return. It's clear that for the people of Muara Tae, sitting on a gold mine isn't a cause for celebration.<b><br/><br/>A steady sense of purpose</b> — Muara Tae's strong connection to their tradition has helped them maintain a deep conviction that their purpose on earth is to act as the guardians of this forest. For this reason, while neighboring villages have sold their ancestral lands to private interests under pressure — including some that traditionally belongs to Muara Tae — no one in Muara Tae has backed down from their sacred contract to protect the forest. At least not yet.<b><br/><br/>They can't do it alone</b> — Because it is so difficult, time consuming and stressful to continue to fight such powerful forces, some members of the village are tempted to give in, sell their land for the pittance offered and move on in despair. Once one family does this, the conviction of the village is sure to erode and the job of forest guardians like Asuy will become even more difficult. With our support, this ceremony can reconnect the local people with one another and with their ancient mandate to protect and care for the forest, knowing that they are doing it not just for themselves, but for the good of all the people of the earth. It can also help heal the rifts between villages over disputed lands and unite them in their common interests so that as they grapple with the disappearance of their forest, the community will stay intact.<br/><span><br/></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/432885/files/20140314022732-borneo_map.jpg?1394789252"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><blockquote>

Through experiential ritual, they are helped to reconnect to the traditional mandate for all humans on the earth: to maintain balance. In this context, all involved make honest reports to the ancestors of their part in the conflict and destruction.</p><p><b>Renewing vows to protect the earth — </b>After everyone has restored connection to their highest values, together they take a vow to protect the health of the forest and the people who live there. Traditionally, the vow is made with great reverence and life-or-death seriousness, for the ancestors are deeply offended by half-heartedness, and once the vow is made, they expect it to be kept. For this reason, people are asked to think deeply about this and only attend the ceremony if they are truly sincere in their desire to restore balance. Since spirit knows no boundaries, this goes for those in the industrial world as well who are participating at a distance.</p><p><b>Partnering with a greater power — </b>If any of the invited parties decide not to participate, the ceremony goes on without them, and the ancestors and cosmic forces are called on to bring life back into balance and alignment in ways that might supercede human understanding and timelines. (In the language of AA, this is surrendering to a greater power.) Traditionally it is said that following such a ceremony, the larger forces take care of events for the ultimate good of all. <br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/432887/files/20140314022837-ceremony_statue_sq72.jpg?1394789317"" src="""" style=""""/></p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(119, 119, 119); font-style: italic;""><p style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif !important; font-size: 15px !important; line-height: 1.45em !important; background-color: initial !important; border-width: initial; border-color: initial;""></p>

The tribe can still use funds for all kinds of needs related to protecting their forest, so if you would like to donate, please contact Jane Brunette.

________________________________________________Could an ancient tribal ceremony stop bulldozers from destroying this Borneo rainforest? The Dayak Benuaq people of Muara Tae are losing their forest to palm oil. Western-style negotiations have failed to stop the clearcutting. With bulldozers poised to take what little remains of their ancestral forest, tribal elders say their best hope is to hold a ceremony that since ancient times has been used to resolve difficult disputes and highly charged situations with great power. Because all people of the earth need the rainforest for their oxygen, tribal leaders invite you to support this ancient vow ceremony (called Sumpah Adat) to protect their forest — for everyone's sake. For the Dayak Benuaq, humans have a sacred contract to nurture and sustain life — it is why we were put on the earth. Their assignment as a tribe is to care for this particular rainforest. To stay in touch with this role and united in their efforts, they have always relied on ceremony. This is how they connect with each other and with the larger cosmic forces as they tune into something bigger and more fulfilling than their personal security and comfort. Unlike Western methods of negotiation, their ceremonial method of conflict resolution taps into the heart and the big picture, where all involved examine their part in the conflict, reconnect to their true values and recommit to their original purpose as humans: to keep the earth in balance. The 64-day ceremony will address tensions with four neighboring villages over disputed land by creating an opportunity to inquire deeply, celebrate and feast together. The tribe will also invite company and government officials to join in this process, though tribal elders say their cooperation is not necessary for the ceremony to correct things. Your participation will add power to the ceremony by extending it across the globe and may help avert violence and direct confrontation between the companies and the local people. We believe that the power of our intentions working together, with a willingness to engage the company and government officials who we will encourage to attend, can change some minds and hearts on both sides of the globe so that the remaining forest can be preserved.Skeptical? Read thisFor those inspired to witness and learn from the Dayak Benuaq's process or create your own version of the ceremony with your family, friends or colleagues, please visit our Guardians of the Forest page on Facebook where we will report on what is unfolding in Muara Tae, and invite an exchange of ideas, stories and reflections. You will have the opportunity to ask questions and send messages that we will relay to the shamans, tribal elders and leaders, and we will be posting photos, videos and updates as the tribe's ceremony progresses so you can be intimately involved from a distance. Please join us in this deep exploration as we build a bridge between cultures and paradigms — for the sake of our forests and all the beings dependent on them.  The ceremony is scheduled to begin in mid May. It will continue for 64 days provided there is sufficient financial support to allow that. We're grateful to Forest Watch, an Indonesian NGO, for generously agreeing to front the money to the tribe as we raise the funds so that the ceremony preparations can happen concurrent with this effort. Our $15,000 goal will allow the Dayak-Benuaq tribe to:
Issue open invitations to all residents of five villages as well as local government officials and companies — more than 1000 people. 

Engage in a 64-day, time-tested way to reconnect with their deeper intuitive wisdom and purpose as a community.

Address current conflicts and divisions within the tribe regarding how to respond to the destruction of their home forest.

Re-unite with their shared mandate to care for the rainforest and keep the earth in balance.

Dialogue with representatives of government and palm oil companies who are willing to engage with them.

Invite the rest of us around the world to bear witness to this process and use it as inspiration as we explore our own responsibility and purpose in relationship to what is happening to the forests of the world.

Cover the expenses of our Indonesian bridge builder who will facilitate the dialogue between us and the tribe.Specifically, our Indiegogo dollars will enable the tribe to:

Cover preparation costs (including labor for creating ritual objects): $1,330

Acquire food (rice etc.) to supplement the villagers' donations and feed all the ceremony attendees: $105 per day 

Pay the traditional dues and ritual offerings to the ten shamans who will facilitate the process: $8.50 per shaman per day

Give offerings to honor the ancestors (flowers, leaves, baskets): $8 per dayThe daily cost of the ceremony is $198. Our Indiegogo contributions will determine how many people can participate and how long the ceremony can last. The elders say that 64 days is what it takes, and the second half of the ceremony is essential.
WHAT IF WE ARE OVERFUNDED? That would be fantastic! It would take $750,000 to protect the remaining forest by establishing a land trust. Short of that, any funds raised beyond the $15,000 goal will be given to the leaders of the alliance of families sponsoring the event to help the local people with whatever is most needed in their effort on behalf of the forest. Asuy — an elder among the Dayak Benuaq — told us that it is a great boost to the spirits of the tribe to feel the eyes of the world on them, to know that we appreciate the difficult work they are doing on behalf of all of us, and that we respect and support their traditional ways. The above short video was made by Mina Setra, a Dayak whose tribe in West Kalimantan lost their ancestral forest to palm oil in only 10 years. It powerfully conveys the emotional side of what it's like for the people to watch their home forest disappear due to outside forces. See our second update for Mina's story. What happened to Muara Tae?A strained immune system —It has been said that the rainforests are the lungs of the earth, and since ancient times, the Dayak Benuaq people have acted like a healthy immune system, nurturing and protecting the forest against imbalance and disease for the sake of all life on earth — including ours. Now, with palm oil plantations encroaching on their land, bulldozing the forest without the tribe's permission and turning it into a hot, dry wasteland, it is as though our collective lungs have developed tuberculosis.Seedlings and bulldozers — The encroachment began with illegal logging, when the hardwood trees the tribe had tended over centuries were cut and sold by private interests. As the tribe nurtures the seedlings of these now endangered trees to replant in degraded forest areas, palm oil companies push into these same forests with their bulldozers and the land goes into dispute. The decisions made by officials over disputed land have resulted in the loss of large portions of Muara Tae forest without the consent of the tribe, and compensation offered after bulldozing is absurdly small. While NGOs continue to work hard through all of this to help, without sufficient attention from rest of the world, the Muara Tae forest continues to vanish with alarming speed. Smart phones and gold — As if this weren't enough, with our new smartphones and laptops in need of precious metals, a mining company suspects there is gold under Muara Tae village and wants to literally dig their homes out from under them to get to it, with the promise of dangerous mining jobs in return. It's clear that for the people of Muara Tae, sitting on a gold mine isn't a cause for celebration.A steady sense of purpose — Muara Tae's strong connection to their tradition has helped them maintain a deep conviction that their purpose on earth is to act as the guardians of this forest. For this reason, while neighboring villages have sold their ancestral lands to private interests under pressure — including some that traditionally belongs to Muara Tae — no one in Muara Tae has backed down from their sacred contract to protect the forest. At least not yet.They can't do it alone — Because it is so difficult, time consuming and stressful to continue to fight such powerful forces, some members of the village are tempted to give in, sell their land for the pittance offered and move on in despair. Once one family does this, the conviction of the village is sure to erode and the job of forest guardians like Asuy will become even more difficult. With our support, this ceremony can reconnect the local people with one another and with their ancient mandate to protect and care for the forest, knowing that they are doing it not just for themselves, but for the good of all the people of the earth. It can also help heal the rifts between villages over disputed lands and unite them in their common interests so that as they grapple with the disappearance of their forest, the community will stay intact.
“The most remarkable feature of this historical moment on earth is not that we are on the way to destroying the world — we’ve actually been on the way for quite a while. It is that we are beginning to wake up, as from a millennia-long sleep, to a whole new relationship to our world, to ourselves and each other.”      —Joanna Macy
What does the ceremony involve?Taking the long view — In the initial stages of the ceremony, participants ground in the long view that includes ancestors and descendants — the generations that came before and will come after us. Through experiential ritual, they are helped to reconnect to the traditional mandate for all humans on the earth: to maintain balance. In this context, all involved make honest reports to the ancestors of their part in the conflict and destruction.Renewing vows to protect the earth — After everyone has restored connection to their highest values, together they take a vow to protect the health of the forest and the people who live there. Traditionally, the vow is made with great reverence and life-or-death seriousness, for the ancestors are deeply offended by half-heartedness, and once the vow is made, they expect it to be kept. For this reason, people are asked to think deeply about this and only attend the ceremony if they are truly sincere in their desire to restore balance. Since spirit knows no boundaries, this goes for those in the industrial world as well who are participating at a distance.Partnering with a greater power — If any of the invited parties decide not to participate, the ceremony goes on without them, and the ancestors and cosmic forces are called on to bring life back into balance and alignment in ways that might supercede human understanding and timelines. (In the language of AA, this is surrendering to a greater power.) Traditionally it is said that following such a ceremony, the larger forces take care of events for the ultimate good of all. 

“To continue to be in good conversation over our enormous and terrifying problems is to be calling out to each other in the night. If we attend with imagination and devotion to our conversations, we will find what we need; and someone among us will act — it does not matter whom — and we will survive.” —-Barry Lopez


Where we come inThe people of Muara Tae are cash poor and have not been able to afford such an extensive ceremony, which requires 64 days of hosting and feeding great numbers of people. Because the ceremony is meant to benefit the whole world, and the unpaid work of these people of maintaining and defending the forest since ancient times has been for the benefit of all of us, Asuy and the people of the forest invite us not just to donate, but to participate with them in our own communities. Asuy said that while the ancestors gave the assignment to humans of maintaining balance, they entrust the people of the earth at a given time to devise the means by which to do this — the ceremonies and methods needed for that time. And so for those of us who have lost touch with our own indigenous roots and no longer have those practices from which to draw inspiration, the tribe offers theirs. The fate of the forests cannot be decided in a lawyer's office. We are called on to get creative and devise new rituals and methods to remind each other of our sacred purpose and to maintain awareness of the impact of our use of resources, which is not as obvious as it is in a traditional community such as Asuy’s. Our hope is that people in the industrial world will be inspired to use internet technology to join with this remote tribe in global, creative, ceremonial space — buoying the spirits of these guardians of the forest for the difficult work they are doing for us on the front lines, and drawing on their inspiring conviction in order to reignite our own dedication to our vital role as humans in restoring and maintaining balance for the good of the whole.
“If we knew for certain that the fate of oceans and trees, tigers 
and bees, and the future of the human family, depended on our 
willingness to turn our attention inward, tune into our bodies, and 
develop our capacity to feel through the layers of numbness and closure 
that trap our vital energy, freeze our receptivity, and disconnect us 
from life within and around us, would we make it a priority?”      —Tesa Silvestre


How would you like to participate?If you connect with the heart of this campaign, we invite you to listen inside to what most draws you. Where is your passion and interest? Here are some suggestions to get you started:• Join our ambassadors' circle.  To share ideas and meet others who are involved on all different levels, please join our campaign Borneo-gogo ambassadors' group on Facebook. At the most basic level, we need help getting the word out, so it would be a great help if you would forward the link to this page with a personal note to friends and colleagues who might be interested, and post it to social media. This effort began out of friendship and feeling, so it is best spread in the same way.• Inspired to do a little more? Consider writing to company managers and government officials respectfully requesting that they participate in the ceremony and reflect deeply on their own values and involvement. For a sample letter, click here. • Drawn to inquire in a fresh way? You can fully join in the spirit of what the indigenous people are trying to do by creating a related ritual, ceremony or inquiry with your group, church, friends or colleagues. For ideas to get you started, click here. • Feeling particularly moved? Why not contribute a song, poem, drawing or short video of yourself expressing from your heart why you want to help protect the forest? Or write a personal note of encouragement to the forest guardians of Muara Tae. Simply put in the comments here, and we will share. For inspiration read the story of how this campaign began with a feeling.• Have the urge to get practical? Consider learning more about the challenges facing the indigenous people of the rainforest and doing what you can to support them. The videos and organizations listed at the foot of this page will get you started.• Want to bring this closer to home? Consider learning about the challenges faced by indigenous people in your area. They are all on the front lines, trying to protect the earth from environmental degradation for the benefit of us all and could really use the support of their neighbors.• Moved to deepen your connection to the earth? Asuy suggests that you get to know your local forest intimately so you can see the richness there — the plants that grow and their uses, the animals that use it as their home. We naturally protect and serve what we know and love.“I was in a split state of incredulity where the arrogance of my smallness was saying, ‘you can do nothing’ and another part of me was saying, ‘This is killing me. I’m living a lie. I’m colluding in a system that is destroying this planet. I can’t keep doing this.’ I woke up in that moment. What I realized is that my insecurities, my inadequacies, my smallness were nothing compared to what was going on and I had a choice to live a life that was completely meaningful. And what I needed was to give myself permission to feel the truth of what was going on and if I could feel that truth, I would move into action and I would move into right action.”—Clare Dakin

</b></div>","WE MADE IT!!
Sol Not Coal is 100% funded! (6/18)
Sending love and gratitude out to our amazing community and supporters from all over the nation! In the face of great climate change challenges, together we are creating the solutions we need for a clean energy economy. If we reach $30K by 11:59pm tonight, we will also be able to solarize The Pueblo of Tesuque Farm Greenhouse, extending the growing season for this farm that provides free organic food to elders, herbs for ceremonial purposes, and healthy food in local markets. THANK YOU for investing in Sol Not Coal!COMMUNITY-SCALE SOLAR 
Visible, high-impact organizations lead the way

Building by building, we can shift away from fossil-fuel
energy to clean, renewable alternatives. New Energy Economy has installed solar electric systems on the buildings of community organizations and fire stations throughout Northern New Mexico, and with your investment in our Sol not Coal campaign, we can do more! Solar today is cost-competitive, creates local jobs, and avoids huge amounts of water use - all with none of the environmental and health hazards of coal and other fossil fuels. For local nonprofits, farms, and public agencies, solar installation allows them to redirect funds previously spent on utility bills to the vital services they provide. Help us demonstrate the tangible economic, environmental, and health benefits
of solar to communities in need, and prove that the shift to renewable
energy is not only necessary but possible TODAY.THE IMPACT
The money saved by going solar will serve thousands of New
Mexicans. With your help, these powerful organizations will run on renewable energy: 

TEWA WOMEN UNITED

TWU is a Native health/cultural revitalization organization serving pueblos in Northern New Mexico since 1989. They provide education, reproductive health services, & domestic violence prevention programming. 

A new community
center will include programming space & a community midwifery
hub. Installation includes energy efficiency upgrades. 
NANCY RODRIGUEZ COMMUNITY CENTERThis community center provides a venue for public events on the underserved southside of Santa Fe. A beloved community gathering space, it provides a kitchen and meeting space for neighborhood meetings, community cooking classes, and public education events.MONTE VISTA FARM
Monte Vista Organic Farm began in 1993, when David and Loretta 
Fresquez started farming at their two-and-a-half-acre residence in
 La Mesilla, mostly as a hobby. They now farm on three additional acres in Rio Lucio to provide healthy, local food to people throughout the region.
New Energy Economy feels very strongly about the importance of building a low-carbon-impact food system that provides organic food locally.
PLAN OF ACTIONHelp us complete funding to:
Install distributed solar electric energy systems. 

Install computer monitors that in real-time record how much solar energy is produced, how much carbon pollution emissions are offset, and how much water is saved.

Install
 educational signage at each facility that explains “How
Solar Works” to further educate constituents, clients, and staff.
Spread the tangible benefits of decentralized solar, with local models for a global transition from a fossil fuel- dependent economy to one that is clean, renewable, and resilient. 
WHY SOLARIZE?
Save on utility bills and redirect these funds to community programs.
Reduce CARBON POLLUTION, conserve WATER, and save MONEY!
Create local jobs in the renewable energy industry.

Amplify awareness about New Mexico's potential for
     being a national leader in solar energy. The state is ranked second for solar potential!

Reduce reliance on coal-fired
     electricity. The Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM) provides
     electricity at the San Juan coal plant, which pumps 12 million
     tons of CO2, 18,000 tons of nitrogen oxide, and 5,500 tons of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere every year. It also uses 6.3 billion
     gallons of water annually (11,000 gallons a minute). 
Educate key organizations and
     their constituents on energy solutions. 

Debunk the utility mantra that
     solar is too costly/not a viable alternative.
Increase outreach
     about climate change and leverage creative solutions.
Build local community
     resilience in the face of climate disruption.
Did you know...

The US solar market grew by 76% in 2012 + an additional 41% in
     2013. More solar was installed in the last 18
     months than the 30 years prior.
As of November 2013, the solar industry employs 142,698 people across 50 states, up 19.9% from the previous year.
PROVEN SUCCESS- A SOLAR MOVEMENTSo
far, our solarization projects have saved our partners over $150,500. The money
previously spent on coal-fired electricity is now re-purposed into community programs. We've avoided over 1 million gallons of water use associated with coal energy production and offset more than 15.42 tons of carbon pollution emissions. Our celebrations include:2014- Chimayo fire station and Zona del Sol. (Zona del Sol is a Santa Fe Youth & Family Center that houses educational, recreational, and social service programs on the underserved south-side of Santa Fe.) 
2014- Santa Fe County fire stations. (We secured $182,000 for the solarization of all County fire stations. The legislative delegation allocated part of their capital outlay dollars to this landmark project.)
July 2013- Tesuque fire station. (At Santa Fe County's first solar-powered
     fire station, the electricity bill plummeted from more than $115 to $8.65 a month, PNM's base rate. Now, PNM sends a check every month.)
Fall 2012- Taytsugeh Oweengeh Intergenerational Center, Pueblo of Tesuque. (The center is home to a senior center, children's library, full basketball court, and the Tribal Council's administrative offices.)
2012- Cerrillos Road fire station.  (We partnered with the City of Santa Fe to install solar at

<p><strong>Did you know….</strong></p>
<p><strong>... Costa Rica uses more pesticides per capita than almost any other country?!...</strong></p>
<p><strong>… and that 96% of human sewage in Costa Rica goes into the natural waterways untreated?!...</strong></p>
<p><strong>… and, that most agriculture and illegal gold mining waste go directly into the local rivers that many communities and wildlife depend on in the Osa?!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm Rachael Eplee and I became passionate about water issues once I learned a few of these dire facts about the state of the waters in this once pristine wild area. Having moved from the US to live and work in the Osa, I am excited to be leading a program called Rios Saludables de Osa (Healthy Rivers of Osa) to promote healthy waters throughout this important area in Costa Rica.</p>
<p>The Osa Peninsula is known as one of “the most biologically intense places on earth” because it is home to 2.5% of the planet’s biodiversity! From the lush tropical rainforests to the pristine beaches, the Osa Peninsula houses many spectacular wildlife, including unique birds, monkeys, turtles and jaguars.  Being passionate about environmental policy and planning,  I was thrilled earlier this year to move to Costa Rica to work with Osa Conservation, an environmental nonprofit organization working to protect the Osa Peninsula.</p>

<h3><strong>THE ISSUE AT HAND</strong></h3>
<p>No one should have to worry that the water they drink, bathe in and use for washing could make them sick!</p>
<p>Osa’s numerous streams and rivers flow through local neighborhoods and then directly out into the open waters surrounding the peninsula.  Public health, community livelihoods, marine life, and the complex natural ecosystems are all greatly threatened by polluted water in the area.</p>
<p>The main sources of this water contamination include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Cattle ranching and agriculture,</strong> which are economic engines in Costa Rica. Despite being a very eco-friendly country, Costa Rica uses more pesticides per capita than almost any other country! Agricultural chemicals and livestock waste pollute creeks and streams which then feed into nearby rivers and marine environments.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Human waste is a big problem, </strong>with<strong> </strong>only 4% of sewage water in Costa Rica being treated before it is released into the environment! Not only is untreated sewage in our waterways gross but it is also highly dangerous. E. coli and other dangerous bacteria contaminate the water and can make people sick.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Illegal gold mining</strong> is another harmful activity that we unfortunately see a lot in the Osa. Run-off from gold mining can disrupt the course of a river and change the water’s composition, as sometimes harmful chemicals like mercury are used.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>We need YOUR HELP to monitor and protect these incredibly important river systems before it is too late!</strong></p>

<h3>TEACHING OTHERS TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE</h3>
<p>To tackle these issues, the Rios Saludables Program has established groups of “citizen scientists,” regular community members like you and me. Participating directly in conservation, these groups are trained on how to “adopt a river” by collecting water samples which are then tested and logged into a shared online map.</p>
<p>Please help us grow our enthusiastic network of local water warriors! While the kids love spending time alongside their stream to monitor the water’s health, the adults enjoy conducting scientific tests and gaining a sense of ownership for protecting this crucial, life-giving resource. </p>

<p><br/></p>
<p><b>So Why Solar?</b></p>
<p> I have always had a fascination with solar power both active and passive.  So much so that I converted my barn into a giant passive solar absorber that is thermostatically controlled.  I constructed a polycarbonate wall with aluminum extruded frames 6"" in front of the garage door but flush with the exterior. When the temperature in the void exceeds 90 degrees the garage door opens exposing a wall of black corrugated steel.  The heat is more than sufficient to heat my workspace...a propane heater takes the chill off on very cold days.</p>
<p>Recently,  I began to experiment with active solar and the need for portable solar generation and more specifically charging storage batteries.  My fascination turned into a passion and I would like to share my findings with anyone that has ever had the notion of harnessing the Sun's power and converting it into electrical energy.</p>
<p>I realize that charging a battery with a solar panel is nothing new or game changing, however, I would challenge you to find an auto-tracking charger or generator that is both affordable and portable. </p>
<p><b>Fixed Angle Panels vs. Tracking Panels</b></p>
<p>There are a lot of portable solar generators on the market but very few of them track the Sun.  A solar panel propped up at a ""fixed angle"" facing due south will only generate the maximum power for about an hour of the day...if the Sun is shining.  Even a 200 watt panel at a fixed position will not produce nearly as much power as a 50 watt panel that tracks the Sun all day long. Depending on your geographical location you have only a few hours a day of sunlight to replace the power you may have consumed the day before. Cloudy days will also reduce the efficiency and the output will drop off dramatically. See illustration below.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/764461/files/20140804021245-solar-panel-rotating-vs-fixed.jpg?1407143565"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>I have always wanted to produce a solar mount that was light-weight and portable and would track the position of the Sun. My goal is to create a unit that is made with readily accessible materials that can be wheeled easily into position and be operational in moments. What I am proposing is a means of charging a typical lead acid battery with a portable charging system that tracks the Sun.  </p>
<p>Although this system will <b>not</b> produce AC power, in this present state, it can produce AC power by simply plugging in a DC to AC inverter of your choosing into the provided battery housing.  There are a number of reasons why I will not include an inverter or a battery for this system. A lead-acid battery is heavy and requires special shipping requirements and an inverter is more a matter of the consumers specific needs and power requirements. A common mistake made by consumers is to expect a single storage battery to produce enough power to run multiple appliances.  That simply is not the case.  </p>
<p><b>What Can You Run?</b></p>
<p>There are a lot of applications where this system is ideal.  A camping trip is the first thing that comes to mind. Charge it during the day and run it off the battery at night using a small inverter.  A remote workshop or job site would also be ideal. In both applications it is possible to run Ac and DC loads while the system is charging if you have an inverter. perhaps the best application for this system is with a Portable Power Generator.  Duracell and Goal Zero are a couple of small lightweight units that can be charged with this solar mount. Your system would include all of the necessary connectors to charge either unit.</p>
<p>This system would be ideal for camping, job sites, workshops or simply just a backup for the Zombie Apocalypse. I personally use one in front of my barn to charge individual storage batteries when they run low.  I also have a 100 watt system that I have anchored to the ground with a 20' quick connect cable to the side of the barn that charges (4) 100 AH batteries. Along side the batteries is a 3000 watt inverter. </p>
<p><b>How it Works</b></p>
<p>The portable solar mount can be easily assembled in minutes, rolled into position and stowed very quickly. It is designed to charge a deep cycle lead acid storage battery (provided by the customer) that would fit in a molded plastic battery housing (this would be provided by me). Connecting the battery to the system powers the electronics and the linear actuator, it also starts the charging process.  </p>

<p>The solar mount can withstand a steady wind of 10-15 knots and it is resistant to water and corrosion. This system is not limited to just charging a storage battery it can easily be used to charge any number of existing ""power generators"" on the market (Duracell, Goal Zero, Mr. Emergency). This provides the consumer with a means of producing immediate AC power because the inverter is ""built-in"" to the power pack.</p>
<p><b>The Solar Tracking System Includes:</b></p>
<p>A 50 watt solar panel on an extruded aluminum frame.  </p>
<p>A 7 amp charge controller mounted on the solar panel</p>
<p>Single Axis Auto-tracking circuit in azimuth</p>
<p>Manual inclination adjustment</p>
<p>12 vdc linear actuator</p>
<p>Battery case w/ built-in charge state &amp; power socket (battery not included) </p>
<p>Quick-connect cables</p>
<p>The purpose of this campaign is not just to sell a portable solar charger that can track the Sun it is an announcement to the world that solar can be affordable, efficient and a really neat way of harnessing the Sun' energy. This is also a gentle reminder that purchasing a ""fixed angle"" solar panel is not nearly as efficient as it could be.  </p>
<p><b>Universal Auto-tracking Mount</b></p>
<p>It is also worth mentioning that this system can easily be adapted to accept up to a 100 watt panel.  This means it is possible to provide auto-tracking for a system that you may have already purchased.  In short, you can improve the performance of an existing system by mounting your solar panel to this mount. Your pledge of $400 would pay for a universal mount conversion (please see perk). The physical footprint of this mount is a little bit more robust and requires more extrusion and hardware. </p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p> I have dumped several thousand dollars in research and development on electronic sensors, aluminum extrusion and linear actuators. I have selected the most cost effective components that I could find but the only way to truly reduce the cost of these units is to purchase these items in bulk.  </p>
<p>I am looking to raise $7500 to purchase extrusion in bulk and to procure enough of the other components to assemble 50 units.  These 50 units would be given in exchange for a full pledge of $500.  I am also offering other incentives in exchange for your pledge. </p>
<p><b>Distribution of Funds</b></p> <ul>
<li>$4000 dollars would be allocated toward extrusion and hardware.</li> <li>$2000 dollars would be applied toward electronics.</li> <li>$1500 dollars would be for actuators and to be applied toward shipping.</li>
</ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>I plan on making this unit affordable for everyone.  I want to keep the retail price of this system at $500.  I am already capable of producing these units but I am essentially giving them away at this price.  I am prepared to honor all pledges even if I am unsuccessful in my attempt to procure the necessary funds.  </p>
<p>There is no reason that the systems I plan to produce could not be used anywhere in the world.  There are parts of the world that have very long solar days that could benefit from a communal charging station. Small power packs could be provided for homes without electricity. The limiting factor is again the battery, A typical 100 AH deep cycle battery can weigh 60-70 pounds.  For this reason I started to construct small light-weight power packs that use LiFePO4 batteries instead of lead acid.  A 20 AH LiFePO4 battery weighs only 8 pounds and it can be discharged lower than 50% of capacity unlike a lead acid battery.</p>
<p>Pictured below is a working prototype with an internal 1200 watt inverter. This type of battery is also safer to transport with a lower shipping cost. Imagine a bank of these on a portable trailer that are powered by a large solar panel that tracks the Sun. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/769948/files/20140806044049-2013-09-06_17.42.29.jpg?1407325249"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>So why would anyone want to have a secondary power source that generates ""Free Power"" that can be converted to useable power to run vital circuits during a power outage?  Who wouldn't?<br/></p>
<div><br/></div>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> I have never attempted to raise funds through a crowd funding source before, I have always funded my own projects and managed to sell them online.  I have been selling my canvas stretching machine for 7 years and we have them all over the world (cheap plug for the Gallery Stretcher). </p>
<p>There are no risks to producing this system because I have already spent the time streamlining the design and I am able to produce them now. It is merely a matter of reducing the overall cost per item to a point where I can sell them at $500.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p></p>
</div>Thank you for viewing my project.  Please use the Indiegogo share tools they are easy to help spread the word. Please take a look at the <a href=""http://www.weedzinger.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Weed Zinger</a> it really is a fun way to remove weeds. No bending or kneeling and the weed shoots directly into the waste bin.<div><br/></div><div>Thank you for any and all help.</div><div>.<p></p>

Recently,  I began to experiment with active solar and the need for portable solar generation and more specifically charging storage batteries.  My fascination turned into a passion and I would like to share my findings with anyone that has ever had the notion of harnessing the Sun's power and converting it into electrical energy.
I realize that charging a battery with a solar panel is nothing new or game changing, however, I would challenge you to find an auto-tracking charger or generator that is both affordable and portable. 
Fixed Angle Panels vs. Tracking Panels
There are a lot of portable solar generators on the market but very few of them track the Sun.  A solar panel propped up at a ""fixed angle"" facing due south will only generate the maximum power for about an hour of the day...if the Sun is shining.  Even a 200 watt panel at a fixed position will not produce nearly as much power as a 50 watt panel that tracks the Sun all day long. Depending on your geographical location you have only a few hours a day of sunlight to replace the power you may have consumed the day before. Cloudy days will also reduce the efficiency and the output will drop off dramatically. See illustration below.


I have always wanted to produce a solar mount that was light-weight and portable and would track the position of the Sun. My goal is to create a unit that is made with readily accessible materials that can be wheeled easily into position and be operational in moments. What I am proposing is a means of charging a typical lead acid battery with a portable charging system that tracks the Sun.  
Although this system will not produce AC power, in this present state, it can produce AC power by simply plugging in a DC to AC inverter of your choosing into the provided battery housing.  There are a number of reasons why I will not include an inverter or a battery for this system. A lead-acid battery is heavy and requires special shipping requirements and an inverter is more a matter of the consumers specific needs and power requirements. A common mistake made by consumers is to expect a single storage battery to produce enough power to run multiple appliances.  That simply is not the case.  
What Can You Run?
There are a lot of applications where this system is ideal.  A camping trip is the first thing that comes to mind. Charge it during the day and run it off the battery at night using a small inverter.  A remote workshop or job site would also be ideal. In both applications it is possible to run Ac and DC loads while the system is charging if you have an inverter. perhaps the best application for this system is with a Portable Power Generator.  Duracell and Goal Zero are a couple of small lightweight units that can be charged with this solar mount. Your system would include all of the necessary connectors to charge either unit.
This system would be ideal for camping, job sites, workshops or simply just a backup for the Zombie Apocalypse. I personally use one in front of my barn to charge individual storage batteries when they run low.  I also have a 100 watt system that I have anchored to the ground with a 20' quick connect cable to the side of the barn that charges (4) 100 AH batteries. Along side the batteries is a 3000 watt inverter. 
How it Works
The portable solar mount can be easily assembled in minutes, rolled into position and stowed very quickly. It is designed to charge a deep cycle lead acid storage battery (provided by the customer) that would fit in a molded plastic battery housing (this would be provided by me). Connecting the battery to the system powers the electronics and the linear actuator, it also starts the charging process.  






The provided battery housing includes a charge-state indicator and a quick-connect power plug.  The charged battery could then be used to power a string of DC lights or to power an inverter to produce AC power. 
The solar mount can withstand a steady wind of 10-15 knots and it is resistant to water and corrosion. This system is not limited to just charging a storage battery it can easily be used to charge any number of existing ""power generators"" on the market (Duracell, Goal Zero, Mr. Emergency). This provides the consumer with a means of producing immediate AC power because the inverter is ""built-in"" to the power pack.
The Solar Tracking System Includes:
A 50 watt solar panel on an extruded aluminum frame.  
A 7 amp charge controller mounted on the solar panel
Single Axis Auto-tracking circuit in azimuth
Manual inclination adjustment
12 vdc linear actuator
Battery case w/ built-in charge state & power socket (battery not included) 
Quick-connect cables
The purpose of this campaign is not just to sell a portable solar charger that can track the Sun it is an announcement to the world that solar can be affordable, efficient and a really neat way of harnessing the Sun' energy. This is also a gentle reminder that purchasing a ""fixed angle"" solar panel is not nearly as efficient as it could be.  
Universal Auto-tracking Mount
It is also worth mentioning that this system can easily be adapted to accept up to a 100 watt panel.  This means it is possible to provide auto-tracking for a system that you may have already purchased.  In short, you can improve the performance of an existing system by mounting your solar panel to this mount. Your pledge of $400 would pay for a universal mount conversion (please see perk). The physical footprint of this mount is a little bit more robust and requires more extrusion and hardware. 
   What We Need & What You Get  I have dumped several thousand dollars in research and development on electronic sensors, aluminum extrusion and linear actuators. I have selected the most cost effective components that I could find but the only way to truly reduce the cost of these units is to purchase these items in bulk.  
I am looking to raise $7500 to purchase extrusion in bulk and to procure enough of the other components to assemble 50 units.  These 50 units would be given in exchange for a full pledge of $500.  I am also offering other incentives in exchange for your pledge. 
Distribution of Funds 
$4000 dollars would be allocated toward extrusion and hardware. $2000 dollars would be applied toward electronics. $1500 dollars would be for actuators and to be applied toward shipping.

  The Impact I plan on making this unit affordable for everyone.  I want to keep the retail price of this system at $500.  I am already capable of producing these units but I am essentially giving them away at this price.  I am prepared to honor all pledges even if I am unsuccessful in my attempt to procure the necessary funds.  
There is no reason that the systems I plan to produce could not be used anywhere in the world.  There are parts of the world that have very long solar days that could benefit from a communal charging station. Small power packs could be provided for homes without electricity. The limiting factor is again the battery, A typical 100 AH deep cycle battery can weigh 60-70 pounds.  For this reason I started to construct small light-weight power packs that use LiFePO4 batteries instead of lead acid.  A 20 AH LiFePO4 battery weighs only 8 pounds and it can be discharged lower than 50% of capacity unlike a lead acid battery.
Pictured below is a working prototype with an internal 1200 watt inverter. This type of battery is also safer to transport with a lower shipping cost. Imagine a bank of these on a portable trailer that are powered by a large solar panel that tracks the Sun. 




So why would anyone want to have a secondary power source that generates ""Free Power"" that can be converted to useable power to run vital circuits during a power outage?  Who wouldn't?

  Risks & Challenges  I have never attempted to raise funds through a crowd funding source before, I have always funded my own projects and managed to sell them online.  I have been selling my canvas stretching machine for 7 years and we have them all over the world (cheap plug for the Gallery Stretcher). 
There are no risks to producing this system because I have already spent the time streamlining the design and I am able to produce them now. It is merely a matter of reducing the overall cost per item to a point where I can sell them at $500.

Their purchase gave them power—the power to run a business <em>their </em>way. La Florida produces organic coffee, bananas, macadamias, and honey that are tastier and more healthful for their customers and better for the environment. With the power to keep their own profits, the people of la Florida have reinvested those savings in the community to improve their living and working conditions, found a school for its children, launch an <a href=""http://fincalaflorida.com/visit.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ecotourism program</a>, protect the rain forest ecosystem, and set aside for the future.</p>
<p>But on November 8 a <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/08/world/americas/guatemala-earthquake-leaves-dozens-dead.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">magnitude 7.4 earthquake</a> less than 100 km (60 miles) away ravaged la Florida. Ten families’ homes need serious repair. A wall fell in La Casa Grande, the community center which houses visitors’ rooms and the school. Most devastatingly, other damage is preventing la Florida from running its business. A water pipe that is crucial for processing coffee beans has broken. Many young coffee trees (almácigo) are hurt, and damage to bee housing has caused an 80% loss of honey.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://fincalaflorida.com/images/header-sml3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>Why Give to La Florida?</strong></h3>
<p>La Florida needs your help! Although the people of la Florida have made immense progress building a strong business and community, they do not have the resources to recover from such a blow alone. This earthquake has destroyed much of their work and threatens their future wellbeing. </p>
<p>Donating to la Florida makes a long-term impact. You are investing in the enduring empowerment of its people. Everything they have achieved, they have achieved in conditions that are physically, politically, and financially more difficult than most of us have ever faced. Now this natural disaster has made those conditions so much worse—but <em>you</em> have the power to give them a fighting chance again.</p>
<p>What’s more, La Florida has a strong tradition of ethical responsibility. Businesses in Central America commonly ignore the best interests of social justice and the environment in order to squeeze the most profit possible out of a property. But the people of la Florida have faith in a better system.  Your donation supports their community <a href=""http://fincalaflorida.com/values.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">values</a> and sustainable, conscientious treatment of the land that they love—their home.</p>
<p><em><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://fincalaflorida.com/images/slide5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></em></p>
<h3><strong>What Will My Donation Do?</strong></h3>
<p>Leaders at la Florida have reported the following breakdown of needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>$1,400 to replace destroyed bee hives, which have resulted in an 80% loss of honey</li>
<li>$1,500 for ten 8-inch PVC pipes and $75 for glue to replace a broken water pipe crucial to coffee bean processing</li>
<li>$2,000 for 50 4x4s and $525 for 36 2x2s to repair 10 families’ homes and the coffee processing building </li>
</ul><h3><strong>Why Give Now?</strong></h3>
<p>The sooner la Florida has the funds to repair the earthquake damage, the sooner everyone will be living in safe shelters and producing organic goods to support themselves once more.</p>
<p>But giving now also takes advantage of the holiday season! If you’re unsure of what to give your loved ones—or if you want to present them with a truly meaningful gift—donate to la Florida in their honor. Nothing tells a person that he or she brightens your life better than a donation that passes on your blessing and improves other lives.</p>
<p>You can also ask your loved ones to donate on <em>your </em>behalf! Avoid receiving material gifts that you don’t much like or intend to use by requesting a donation to a cause that is important to you.</p>

A water pipe that is crucial for processing coffee beans has broken. Many young coffee trees (almácigo) are hurt, and damage to bee housing has caused an 80% loss of honey.

Why Give to La Florida?
La Florida needs your help! Although the people of la Florida have made immense progress building a strong business and community, they do not have the resources to recover from such a blow alone. This earthquake has destroyed much of their work and threatens their future wellbeing. 
Donating to la Florida makes a long-term impact. You are investing in the enduring empowerment of its people. Everything they have achieved, they have achieved in conditions that are physically, politically, and financially more difficult than most of us have ever faced. Now this natural disaster has made those conditions so much worse—but you have the power to give them a fighting chance again.
What’s more, La Florida has a strong tradition of ethical responsibility. Businesses in Central America commonly ignore the best interests of social justice and the environment in order to squeeze the most profit possible out of a property. But the people of la Florida have faith in a better system.  Your donation supports their community values and sustainable, conscientious treatment of the land that they love—their home.

What Will My Donation Do?
Leaders at la Florida have reported the following breakdown of needs:

$1,400 to replace destroyed bee hives, which have resulted in an 80% loss of honey
$1,500 for ten 8-inch PVC pipes and $75 for glue to replace a broken water pipe crucial to coffee bean processing
$2,000 for 50 4x4s and $525 for 36 2x2s to repair 10 families’ homes and the coffee processing building 
Why Give Now?
The sooner la Florida has the funds to repair the earthquake damage, the sooner everyone will be living in safe shelters and producing organic goods to support themselves once more.
But giving now also takes advantage of the holiday season! If you’re unsure of what to give your loved ones—or if you want to present them with a truly meaningful gift—donate to la Florida in their honor. Nothing tells a person that he or she brightens your life better than a donation that passes on your blessing and improves other lives.
You can also ask your loved ones to donate on your behalf! Avoid receiving material gifts that you don’t much like or intend to use by requesting a donation to a cause that is important to you.

Who made this page? My name is Katie Barnes, and I created and manage this campaign page with help from other supporters of la Florida. (My pictures show me picking coffee beans off the trees and one of the kids we met at la Florida!) I have visited la Florida twice, first with my older daughter in 2007 and then again in 2011 with my younger daughter. I wanted both of them to have the great experience!  I have supported la Florida since that first amazing visit and hope to return to see them again soon. I was horrified at the news of the earthquake and joined forces with some others from Me Encanta Finca La Florida, Guatemala! on Facebook to help our Guatemalan friends get back on their feet.
