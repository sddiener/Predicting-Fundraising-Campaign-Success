<p><strong>Necessity Really is the Mother of Invention!</strong></p>
<p> <strong>Swabbies </strong>was developed<strong> </strong>out of necessity.  As a single mother of three children, I experienced years of diaper changings and wrangling squirming babies, often which go hand in hand.  Desperately wishing I had a free hand and a clean hand at the end of it, I was inspired to create a <strong>better diaper rash formula</strong> combined with an <strong>effective, no mess, one-handed method</strong> for administering. </p>

<p>  </p> <p>   The design of the applicator is such that it can be applied with <strong>one hand</strong>.  Not only will<strong> Swabbies</strong> allow for one hand to remain free, but its design also reduces and almost <strong>eliminates any messy applications</strong>.  Because the foam applicator is a part of the original design, the person administering the treatment will not need to put any of the cream on their hands, unlike all other diaper creams on the market.  This aspect of the product is most appealing when in a rush, when traveling when concerned about <strong>sanitary purposes</strong> or <strong>ON-THE-GO!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Athletes and a caretaker of an elderly patient</strong> will also appreciate the design not only for sanitary reasons, but or the efficiency of applying the cream.</p>

<p>ANF works with a network of over 1,200 governmental, religious, and nonprofit entities — schools, rural clinics, orphanages, elderly homes, hospitals, etc. — to ensure the delivery of humanitarian aid to the most vulnerable communities in poverty-stricken Nicaragua. Since 1992, ANF has distributed over $1.6 billion worth of aid across the country.</p>
<p>In 2014, we distributed 378 ocean-freight containers of aid, all stored in our 3 warehouses, which together have the surface area of a US football field. After 20 years of wear and tear, these warehouses are in danger of collapsing.</p>
<h3>Nicaragua’s poor are at risk of losing 36,000 meals per day, medicine and supplies for 140 medical centers, and educational materials for 75,000 children and 600 schools. Will you help us prevent this potential catastrophe?</h3>
<p>Nicaragua's rainy season starts in June. Heavy rainfall and strong tropical winds put our entire operation at risk. We need your help.</p>
<p>As Nicaragua’s 2nd largest importer and 1st largest relief and development organization, ANF depends on its worn-down warehouses to store donated aid.</p>
<p>What will you be safeguarding with your donations? Items include:</p>

<li>Medicine and medical equipment</li>
<li>Wheelchairs and mobility assistive devices</li>
<li>School supplies</li>
<li>Classroom furniture</li>
<li>Household items and construction materials</li>
<li>Food such as vitamin-fortified soy blends, rice, beans, milk, cereals, etc.</li>

<p>ANF operates to achieve maximum impact for every donation. Of every $1 received, only $0.02 is spent on administrative expenses, maximizing what can be contributed to those who need it most: Nicaragua’s poor.

<p>The total cost of the roof repairs is quoted at <strong>$164,153 </strong>(roughly $2.50/ft<sup>2</sup>), an out-of-pocket expense that can no longer be avoided.

<p><b>What we want the Eco Art Village to be ? </b></p>

<div>We are now in what's called Low Season (May till November) when there is a lot of rain and there is very little tourism on the island. Therefore, this is our time to work, to be ready to welcome people to our community in November! </div>
<div>The strong rain and frequent storms bring all sorts of things to the beach that we can re-use like ropes, fisherman equipment that can be turned into various useful/artistic projects, hangers, lighters (we make lamps and installations) and most important for us - lots and lots of beautiful, unique and strong drift wood, our main building material that we can make almost anything with - tables, chairs, outdoor shower, garden set up, chilling platforms and more... All reclaimed and re-used wood, often very unique because of the sea shaping.</div>

<li>Bamboo hut for visitors to stay. We plan to have 6 for start(we have one already), although we have enough space for about 8 or 9 and if we go over with our goal we will buy more. Cost of one fairly basic hut is 350$ so 5 huts will be - around <b>1750$</b>

</li>
<li>Cement platform (decorated with bottles, shells, sea glass and broken tiles) for circus and yoga workshops and palm leaf roof - around <b>150$</b>
</li>

</li>
</ul>
<div><br/></div>
<div>In case we don't reach our full goal... We cannot exactly tell you now which of projects we will chose to go on with. It all depend on the funds we will raise. After the campaign finishes and we know how much money we've raised<span style=""background-color: initial;""> we will make a detailed plan and share it with you!</span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">  </span>
</div>
<div>
<br/>If we are lucky to raise more money than our goal there is so much more we can do! We would buy 1 or 2 more of the huts to allow more people to stay in the community. We would buy a TV or with more money - a projector, as we are dreaming of having a sleep over movie nights and documentary watching evenings. We would buy more paint. We would buy a tattoo gun for Noi, so we can open alongside a tattoo shop (a little dream of Noi). We would also buy more hammocks ;) <span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span>
</div>
<div>
<br/><b>For your generous contributions</b>, you will have our eternal gratitude, facebook thank yous, skype calls, invitations to stay with us as VIP guests and...</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we just added few new handmade perks:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>One and only unique lamp, made entirely out of lighters and plastic that was picked up from the sea in low season. It took Noi 2 months to pick up the lighters (about 1500) and one month of work to create it! </div>

Hello! Welcome to 




In a beautiful Koh Lanta island, Thailand




We are a group of 3 people, a couple and a friend and we share 3 big passions: art, ecology and fire dance. In March this year we came across this amazing land (2400 sq m) with a house and a huge front room on Koh Lanta island in Thailand. We've decided to rent it and start a venture called Eco Art Village.














What we want the Eco Art Village to be ? 
We want to create a small, artistic and peaceful community where people can just visit for an hour or stay for a month. A place for travelers, tourist, backpackers and locals. 


We want the village to be a small guest house, which we build ourselves with help of international volunteers, created mainly by means of natural building, drift wood, old jungle wood, shells, stones, creative recycling and up-cycling. Guest house where our guests will be encouraged to join us in artistic activities.
We are already running Fire/Circus School. It is a school where people can learn how to dance with fire with various props and how to walk the slackline.


 We will educate visitors about environment and ecology and promote sustainable and natural ways of living. We are already working with Trash Hero Koh Lipe organization and in near future we will be big part of Trash Hero Koh Lanta

 We will hold various artistic workshops (creative recycling, jewelery making, natural building and more).

We will hold daily, donation based, yoga classes.


We will grow our own food. 


We will have a daytime bar with healthy, homemade drinks and food (Thai and Western).

 We will have a Happy Hippy shop with handmade jewelery, clothing, accessories and home decorations (open to artist/travelers to display and sell their work without commission.) .
We will teach English for free to local children and get our guests and volunteers involved.

 The Village is located by the road which cuts through the island, connecting West and East side. We are surrounded by nature and jungle, but only 1,2 km away from beautiful, 4 km long beach with amazing sunsets almost every day. The nearest bars and restaurants are 1 km away which makes this place quiet and peaceful at night. Our next door neighbor are: Elephant Safari Camp, Butterfly farm, Orchid Farm and Fruit Farm
Let me introduce the team to those who don't know who we are:
Kat is 26 years old traveler, artist and fire performer from Poland. She's been living abroad and traveling for over 7 years. Before coming to the village, she lived in and managed another art community/backpacker hostel for 14 months. She is a hard working dreamer who knows how to be realistic and organize work and resources, she is a problem solver, 20 years yoga practitioner, artist, jewelery maker and fire dancer. She also knows how to build things, using power tools and natural resources. She can speak 3 languages and now she is studying Thai. 


Noi is one of the most diversely talented Thai people you will probably meet and he's been living on Koh Lanta for 11 years. He is 40 and he can dance with fire (almost every kind of prop), cook, make jewelery, design and build (house, toilet, furniture, bar, rabbit cage - you name it), mix cocktails, paint masterpieces, tattoo, make beautiful things out of trash picked up from the sea, dance, do landscaping and gardening... And he is amazing at all of those skills!  He's super handyman and speaks 2 languages.

Ronny is half Thai, half Swedish, incredible fire performer (Poi and staff) and great teacher, traveler and also very creative soul. He is 28 years old and when he isn't traveling, he's living in Sweden. He speaks 3 languages. Ronny will be joining us around September/October and staying for all high season. He will help with the building and artistic part, but mostly, he will be teaching in the fire school and make play props (poi, sticks, etc) for the Happy Hippy shop. 


   
We are now in what's called Low Season (May till November) when there is a lot of rain and there is very little tourism on the island. Therefore, this is our time to work, to be ready to welcome people to our community in November! 
The strong rain and frequent storms bring all sorts of things to the beach that we can re-use like ropes, fisherman equipment that can be turned into various useful/artistic projects, hangers, lighters (we make lamps and installations) and most important for us - lots and lots of beautiful, unique and strong drift wood, our main building material that we can make almost anything with - tables, chairs, outdoor shower, garden set up, chilling platforms and more... All reclaimed and re-used wood, often very unique because of the sea shaping.





What We Need & What You Get We already paid a rent for one year and invested some money into painting, renovating and making it a home for us and other wanderers.







But in order to make it to the functional and thriving community we are dreaming of -  we need your help.
Here is the list of the projects that need financial support and estimated cost (please note we pay for almost everything in Thai Baht thats why we give rough US dollar price):




Bamboo hut for visitors to stay. We plan to have 6 for start(we have one already), although we have enough space for about 8 or 9 and if we go over with our goal we will buy more. Cost of one fairly basic hut is 350$ so 5 huts will be - around 1750$

Electric supplies to connect huts to power - around 125$
Outdoor shower  - around 80$


Outdoor compost toilet - around 95$

Manure compost bin  - around 65$
More sophisticated and cleaner rain water collection system ( we have one already, but very very basic, a funnel at the edge of roof with 50 gallon/200 l container below, which we fill daily in rain season) - around 65$

Running water system (we use bucket system at the moment)  - around 160$

Set of 6 colors acrylic paint cans for our guests and us  - around 65$

Sewing machine to create beautiful unique designs for our Happy Hippy Shop (We have lots and lots beautiful, mostly re-claimed fabric)  - around 95$

Dremel machine to help us create amazing handmade jewelery - around 50$

Fridge with a freezer (we live without one at the moment) - around 300$ for new one but we will try to get a second hand

2nd hand pillows and sheets and mosquito nets for our huts - around 80$

4 double mattresses for the huts (we have 2 already) - around 150$

3 fans for the huts (we have 3 already) - around 40$

Installation of the Internet  - around 80$

Cement platform (decorated with bottles, shells, sea glass and broken tiles) for circus and yoga workshops and palm leaf roof - around 150$

Lawn mower (it's ridiculous how fast the grass grow here and with 2400 sq m it's not easy to manage) - around 150$ for a new one but we will try to get a second hand 

Palm leaf fence to separate us from Elephant Camp and Banana Farm - around 95$

Soil and seed, garden tools and equipment  - around 90$

Alminium pipes, tenis balls, socks etc to make more training props - around 40$

7 Yoga mats - around 70$



In case we don't reach our full goal... We cannot exactly tell you now which of projects we will chose to go on with. It all depend on the funds we will raise. After the campaign finishes and we know how much money we've raised we will make a detailed plan and share it with you!  


If we are lucky to raise more money than our goal there is so much more we can do! We would buy 1 or 2 more of the huts to allow more people to stay in the community. We would buy a TV or with more money - a projector, as we are dreaming of having a sleep over movie nights and documentary watching evenings. We would buy more paint. We would buy a tattoo gun for Noi, so we can open alongside a tattoo shop (a little dream of Noi). We would also buy more hammocks ;)  


For your generous contributions, you will have our eternal gratitude, facebook thank yous, skype calls, invitations to stay with us as VIP guests and...

we just added few new handmade perks:

One and only unique lamp, made entirely out of lighters and plastic that was picked up from the sea in low season. It took Noi 2 months to pick up the lighters (about 1500) and one month of work to create it! 


Hand made coconut and shells gratitude ""bells""


And hand wrapped various beautiful shells from Andaman sea.... Made into pendants that can be either used to make a necklace or key ring. With or without macrame necklace cords.





The Impact

   This project is an amazing opportunity for us to create something really unique on Koh Lanta - peaceful and relaxed community without the distractions of loud music and bars, yet civilized enough for most levels of comfort (and with a wi-fi!). Only 1 km away from busy seaside village, where travelers can go out and enjoy the vibrant island night life, but be able to return to the quiet village for a peaceful night sleep. Place with so little light pollution that enables incredible night sky view, place where they will wake up to birds chirrups, where you will open  your doors to elephants and horsesPlace where you can learn how to re-use something you thought of as garbage, to turn it into something useful or decorative. Place where you can learn about natural medicines and natural beauty. We are also working with Trash Hero Koh Lipe and helping to start Trash Hero Koh Lanta.We will be hosting weekly free English lessons for the local Thai children



We believe in our success as we are all experienced in many areas relevant to the project: Kat  before moving to the village managed another well known  community/backpacker hostel for 14 months, where she gained experience in natural building (clay, bamboo, drift wood), organizing a life and finances for the community, volunteer management and much more. She is also a very creative artist, DIY person, creative ""recycler"", yoga practitioner with 18 years experience and a fire performer, with teacher level for majority of her skills. You can watch the video of her giving a tour of her last project in the Extras.Noi is experienced builder and handyman, he helped to build, create and run many bars and shops in Thailand. He is super creative artist, creative ""recycler"", DIY person, amazing cook, fantastic fire performer and very good teacher for all the skills he posses.Ronny owned and run a beach bar before, he is amazing fire performer with great teaching skills and also a handyman with a lot of super creative ideas.
 
   Risks & Challenges There are always risk in any kind of business or venture. But we believe we are qualified and ready to overcome any as they come, as we are all extremely passionate about what we are doing!
 It's not just a business, those are our passions (art, ecology and environment, building, creations, communal living style,  yoga, fire dancing) which we turn in to way of living and earning our living. By sharing our passions with the world, and at the same time, promote sustainable living and help the health of our planet. Plus we are best friends and have good network of amazing people around us, ready to support us.

Please help us to make some noise about our campaign, by sharing it with your friends and family, who knows, maybe in your friends circle there will be folks who will get super excited about our project.Please don't be shy to use the sharing tools! :)

(17m-long) swimming pool, kitchen, toilets and a pizza oven. He is a skilled
builder and a local leader and he is passionate about helping the local
community. As for many Mozambicans, life is a struggle but by starting his own restaurant/campsite
he hopes to provide many jobs for his family and the community. When the
charity moved earlier this year, Pintrasonne was given the use of the future
campsite as a reward for his hard work and loyalty. With 6 children of his own,
he and his wife have also adopted his 8 orphaned nephews and nieces. Paulinho, his eldest son is an ace student
and as the family member who speaks most English, it is he who appeals on video

<p>Every donation really helps. Every infrastructure improvement we can make will lead to the next one. Pintrasonne wants to work and is very sad that he has come that far in creating the first buildings but still cannot offer guest more than the stunning view.

employees, farmers and staff from its 4 schools and 2 hospitals. The city Blantyre in Malawi is just one hour and 15 minutes away. The busy market town of
Mulanje is just over the border. Milange has no tourist facilities outside of
town and those inside provide basic food and drinks sometimes (if you are
lucky). Pintrassone’s ‘Leopard Spot’ is well needed for travelers to and from
Malawi and Mozambique. It is already a favoured picnic spot at weekends. The
countryside is stunning with steep hills, waterfalls and gorgeous flowers.</span></p>

place up and running. ‘The Leopard Spot’ as the campsite has been named,
is a beautiful site with wildlife (hence the name), rivers and streams with
stunning views over neighboring Malawian tea plantations.

 
View from The Leopard Spot 
Pintrasonne started working
on the campsite in 2008 when it was developed by a charity. He helped  build the restaurant and restore the ruined
(17m-long) swimming pool, kitchen, toilets and a pizza oven. He is a skilled
builder and a local leader and he is passionate about helping the local
community. As for many Mozambicans, life is a struggle but by starting his own restaurant/campsite
he hopes to provide many jobs for his family and the community. When the
charity moved earlier this year, Pintrasonne was given the use of the future
campsite as a reward for his hard work and loyalty. With 6 children of his own,
he and his wife have also adopted his 8 orphaned nephews and nieces. Paulinho, his eldest son is an ace student
and as the family member who speaks most English, it is he who appeals on video
on behalf of his dad.

                                           Pintrasonne with his family 


Because Mozambican banks don’t lend money to workers to start a project like this, Pintrasonne needs help. His family forms a perfect team and with a small injection of cash - your help  - he can transform the tourism scene in town, ensuring local ownership, sustainability...and some great times for travellers!!
Every donation really helps. Every infrastructure improvement we can make will lead to the next one. Pintrasonne wants to work and is very sad that he has come that far in creating the first buildings but still cannot offer guest more than the stunning view. He wants to sell them drinks and pizza and he wants to offer accommodation. He only needs a few things done before he can officially open.

About Milange
A small bustling Mozambican town on the
border with Malawi. It is full of businessmen, truck drivers, local government
employees, farmers and staff from its 4 schools and 2 hospitals. The city Blantyre in Malawi is just one hour and 15 minutes away. The busy market town of
Mulanje is just over the border. Milange has no tourist facilities outside of
town and those inside provide basic food and drinks sometimes (if you are
lucky). Pintrassone’s ‘Leopard Spot’ is well needed for travelers to and from
Malawi and Mozambique. It is already a favoured picnic spot at weekends. The
countryside is stunning with steep hills, waterfalls and gorgeous flowers.

So, why not take this moment to become a member of our community, and build with us.</p>We need the support of any who will give it so that we can provide our members with the best benefits possible. We need financial support to gain official non-profit status, host, and sponsor Asatru related events around the world. <p><br/></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>Update: We also need to raise funds for official non profit status. </p><p>We need the help of the world, to help spread diversity, to help spread culture, and religious freedom, not just for ourselves, but for all peoples. If we can show the world that heathens can be good, kind hearted, completely non racist people, it will be better for all minority religions. </p><p>Very simply, we need money. Our organization is completely free to join, and free to partake in. We charge for nothing (save items we may sell) It is difficult to fund events, and our members without membership dues etc. But we do not want to charge our members money. We will only do what we can. That is why we need your help! We need help to provide for our members, in many ways:</p><p>What we would use the money for:</p><p>Community strengthening events and gatherings </p><p>Website maintenance (Websites arn't free!) </p><p>Our Community Outreach program where we help support the less fortunate </p><p>Magazine production</p><p>Student Programs and Scholarships </p><p>The furtherance of Asatru, and our place in the world. </p><h3>The Impact</h3><p> The Asatru Community is not like other Asatru organizations that you may be a part of, or have heard of. While I cannot, and would not dare claim that TAC is perfect, or better, but we do strive to be different than what the world currently offers.</p><p>Before we get any farther, I think it is important to define what Asatru is: </p><p>So what do we do? What are we for? Well, that all depends on why you are a part of TAC. We are not a “single use” organization, as a matter of fact, you may not even want to call us an organization. We are more of a network; connecting kindreds and individuals around the world so that they can provide each other, through TAC, knowledge, teachings, and aide when possible. Our goal at TAC is to try and unify as many heathens as possible to create a network of knowledge and wisdom that all members can tap into. We want to provide the tools needed to grow already existing kindreds, and help create new ones. We want to help those who wish to stay individuals with the resources that they need to learn and grow in the way that they want to.</p><p>TAC is not a church, and nor do we want it to be. TAC is not a physical organization, it is an idea. An idea that heathens of various belief systems can come together in a safe, free environment to share, spread, and gain knowledge from their fellows. An idea that events can be hosted around the world by various individuals and kindreds to help support their local communities.  We understand that ideas will vary greatly, and we support, and hope that they do. There can be no free thought without varying ideas. This is how we learn, and experience the real world, how it was intended to be experienced.</p><p>So what makes The Asatru Community different? Well there are a few ways in which The Asatru Community differs from other organizations. Are we better? Well that is for you to decide, but we do try to be different. We do not have any membership fees. It is free to join, and you shall never be asked to pay in order to be part of TAC. A few other ways that we are different include:</p><ul>
<li><p>We strictly abide by our By-Laws, which we have created and feel are fair. </p></li>
<li><p>While some groups cater to kindreds, or to individuals, we put both on the same level, and honor, and provide our services to both equally. An individual is just as important to us as a large kindred.</p></li>
<li><p>TAC is not led by an individual, but The Board of Directors, and they only manages affairs, that are strictly TAC related issues, not you, or your kindred.</p></li>
<li><p>You do not have to compromise, or change your ideals to join TAC, or participate. There will be many varying ideas.</p></li>
<li><p>You are still you, not something or someone else.</p></li>
<li><p>Those are just some of the differences between us and some of the other Asatru or Heathen organizations.</p></li>
</ul><p>So what will TAC offer? Think of it this way, you, or your kindred is an individual village. You run things the way you want to, you are isolated, and do things the way you want. You have your own rules, you have your own ways to honor the holy powers, and you take care of your own the way that your own community needs to. But here and there you travel to the market place to trade, gather news, hear stories, partake in raids (we will not be doing this) and join in some greater community events outside of your own village’s. That is exactly what TAC is! TAC is the market place you go to! You come bringing your goods to trade, (knowledge, the want to host events, services that you can provide, members, ideas, wisdom, your own networks etc.) and you get those things back in return from others around the world who have come to that marketplace, that network to trade. Do the traders present tell you what to do, or how to do something? No! So where does The Council come in then if they do not tell you what to do? Why, they would be the market guards! They stand at the side and watch. They do not tell you what to do, however If there is a fight, or a thief in the market they kick them out of the marketplace in order to keep the peaceful trading going! It is the same! The marketplace has some basic rules, which the traders and villagers have to follow in order to keep the piece, but not to control them. Are you starting to see what TAC is?</p><p> TAC is the tools and the network, but you are still the providers and the people that will make TAC grow, and become what we know it can be! Unlike other organizations, we are not all unified under one way of doing something or thinking. All of our members are free to do as they please (as long as they abide by our COC). Unlike other organizations and groups, we allow you to practice, and do things the way that you want to do them. We are a growing organization, both in the real world, and in the virtual one. But it all depends on you, and your needs.</p><p>So why should you join TAC? Well TAC is not for everyone. If you want a network, with anchors in real people and real communities, that is safe and free of racism, a place where you can have access to growing “libraries” of information, a place where you can reach out to others similar to you, a place where there is a true sense of community, then The Asatru Community is right for you.</p><p>If you would like to learn more, please send an email to theasatrucommunity@outlook.com, with an appropriate subject please. Thank you!</p><p><strong>If we are able to have funds, our goals can be reached, our reach can be unlimited. The heathen community would never be the same. </strong></p><p><strong>Heathens could get that much farther in finding their proper place in the world. We stand not only for the freedom of heathens, but of all people. Equality. That is what it is all about. And we need your help. </strong></p><h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3><strong>Can't Contribute? That's fine! There are many ways in which you can help! You can become a charter member of TAC, spread the word about out mission statement and goals, and just help show the world what being a heathen truly is!</strong><p></p><br/></div>","Short SummaryOur Mission Statement:TAC is a community of heathens from all walks of life, who have joined together with a unified goal: To bring heathenry into the modern age.

There can be no free thought without varying ideas. This is how we learn, and experience the real world, how it was intended to be experienced.So what makes The Asatru Community different? Well there are a few ways in which The Asatru Community differs from other organizations. Are we better? Well that is for you to decide, but we do try to be different. We do not have any membership fees. It is free to join, and you shall never be asked to pay in order to be part of TAC. A few other ways that we are different include:
We strictly abide by our By-Laws, which we have created and feel are fair. 
While some groups cater to kindreds, or to individuals, we put both on the same level, and honor, and provide our services to both equally. An individual is just as important to us as a large kindred.
TAC is not led by an individual, but The Board of Directors, and they only manages affairs, that are strictly TAC related issues, not you, or your kindred.
You do not have to compromise, or change your ideals to join TAC, or participate. There will be many varying ideas.
You are still you, not something or someone else.
Those are just some of the differences between us and some of the other Asatru or Heathen organizations.
So what will TAC offer? Think of it this way, you, or your kindred is an individual village. You run things the way you want to, you are isolated, and do things the way you want. You have your own rules, you have your own ways to honor the holy powers, and you take care of your own the way that your own community needs to. But here and there you travel to the market place to trade, gather news, hear stories, partake in raids (we will not be doing this) and join in some greater community events outside of your own village’s. That is exactly what TAC is! TAC is the market place you go to! You come bringing your goods to trade, (knowledge, the want to host events, services that you can provide, members, ideas, wisdom, your own networks etc.) and you get those things back in return from others around the world who have come to that marketplace, that network to trade. Do the traders present tell you what to do, or how to do something? No! So where does The Council come in then if they do not tell you what to do? Why, they would be the market guards! They stand at the side and watch. They do not tell you what to do, however If there is a fight, or a thief in the market they kick them out of the marketplace in order to keep the peaceful trading going! It is the same! The marketplace has some basic rules, which the traders and villagers have to follow in order to keep the piece, but not to control them. Are you starting to see what TAC is? TAC is the tools and the network, but you are still the providers and the people that will make TAC grow, and become what we know it can be! Unlike other organizations, we are not all unified under one way of doing something or thinking. All of our members are free to do as they please (as long as they abide by our COC). Unlike other organizations and groups, we allow you to practice, and do things the way that you want to do them. We are a growing organization, both in the real world, and in the virtual one. But it all depends on you, and your needs.So why should you join TAC? Well TAC is not for everyone. If you want a network, with anchors in real people and real communities, that is safe and free of racism, a place where you can have access to growing “libraries” of information, a place where you can reach out to others similar to you, a place where there is a true sense of community, then The Asatru Community is right for you.If you would like to learn more, please send an email to theasatrucommunity@outlook.com, with an appropriate subject please. Thank you!If we are able to have funds, our goals can be reached, our reach can be unlimited. The heathen community would never be the same. Heathens could get that much farther in finding their proper place in the world. We stand not only for the freedom of heathens, but of all people. Equality. That is what it is all about. And we need your help. Other Ways You Can HelpCan't Contribute? That's fine! There are many ways in which you can help! You can become a charter member of TAC, spread the word about out mission statement and goals, and just help show the world what being a heathen truly is!",0.0,0,"8 Campaigns

 INTRODUCING: 


     
Attractive design. The Vinesso has a thermostat control dial for maintaining a perfect temperature for red, white or rose wines.  Insulated cooling compartment keeps chamber cool up to 3 hours after shut off.  Convenient, retractable drip tray keeps the area clean.
The Vinesso will hold most 1.5 - 3 liter bag-in-box products or two - 750ml bottles, or insert the reservoir tank to chill your personal favorites! 
    
Great for COMMERCIAL ESTABLISHMENTS. 
Single glass pours become cost effective - keep product fresh, economical B-I-B, ecologically friendly, less waste.
Includes a 12 volt adapter - perfect for tailgating, the RV, camper or boat. 




       


The Vinesso cooler from Beviamo Products was featured at the International Housewares Show in Chicago, March, 2015. 
                         ""Gadget of the Month""



From Kitchen News & Housewares Review, March 2015

  WHAT DAMAGES WINE THE MOST? 
Answer: Temperature and Oxygen!
(The Vinesso chills beverages to perfect temperature every time)

THE PROBLEMS:


Serving wine  at an improper temperature (too hot or too cold) destroys flavor and bouquet.


Serving guests from a cardboard box - is that really appropriate? 


Vacuum pumps are not very effective for preserving wine properly. Vacuum pumping your wine, just as in some food products, can affect and destroy flavor.


Spray cans are not that effective either! There are many blends and types of  spray canisters of Nitrogen, Argon and CO2. They will all work - to a point. The problem lies in the application itself. You simply lay a ""blanket"" of nitrogen over the wine replacing the oxygen. Perfect... until you force the cork back in. That pressure alone causes a  remix of the nitrogen and oxygen thereby limiting its effectiveness. Residual oxygen also creeps back in when reaching for the cork. Plus - the straw always seems to fall out into the bottle.





                             



            How do wine producers keep wine fresh? 

(Hint: They don't use a vacuum pump!)

The ""head-space"" in the bottle is back-flushed with nitrogen removing damaging oxygen from being in contact with the wine.  Approximately 78% of the air we breathe is nitrogen. 100% safe, effective and natural.





THE SOLUTION:



_____________________________________________________________________________



The blanketing process utilizing the Duckit is more   effective than anything available on the market! 

Keep your wine fresh, the way the producers do. 

The Duckit is a patent pending, two way silicone rubber duckbill (like a sippy cup) inserted into a specially formed and vented silicone rubber bottle stopper. 





   THIS IS THE PERFECT SOLUTION FOR KEEPING                                    WINE FRESH!



Use in conjunction with canister of Natural Preserve. 100% safe and effective, food grade nitrogen with a fold-down STAINLESS STEEL STRAW. No other preserver on the market has this unique feature!

Straw will not fall out into the bottle - like so many others and... the Stainless Steel Straw helps reduce cross-contamination. 





What will the funds be used for?

I now have three daughters and I would like to bring Rick's music to a new medium and produce the type of creative interactive animation projects that will encourage exploration, and inspire imagination and creativity among today's generation of kids. 'Alligator in the Elevator: Learn to Count' is the first of these projects and why I formed Little Starship Productions. 






The 'Alligator in the Elevator: Learn to Count' app will contain an animated cartoon video for the song ""Alligator in the Elevator"" along with simple interactive learning activities targeted for preschool-age children that will extend the themes and situations explored in the cartoon and will follow an educational curriculum that includes basic counting skills. Subsequent apps in the series will cover letters, shapes, memory skills, art and music appreciation as well as social awareness.

To assist with character development and art direction I have enlisted the help of Brian Main, creator of the highly-acclaimed lil'Red storybook app.

Risks & Challenges




Krishna Ramnath
With 20 years of animation/video production and project management experience under my belt, and a network of talented creative collaborators I feel that we are well equipped to tackle any risks associated with this project. My expertise encompasses all aspects of the digital production spectrum from creative idea generation  through technical production, post production final delivery as well as marketing and advertising. I have run a successful design firm in the past and I have the experience and knowledge to grow this business.
We are presently on target to complete production on 'The Alligator in the Elevator:Learn to Count' app by the end of April 2015.
Other Ways You Can Help Even the smallest donation is extremely helpful and appreciated.

<p>I'm
Mario, from Italy. I'm an entrepreneur and an inventor involved
in technology since 80' and also CEO of my companies Project Studio and Computer Design. I would like to change the way to approach solutions <i><b>using a</b></i>
<b><i>smart point of view</i></b>.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>After many patents and time spent to understand what is really important and what we really need from technology I understood that the best thing<i><b> we </b><b>need is a smart tech</b></i>  that <i><b>permit to us to reach ubiquity</b></i>. Imagine how cool it will be when you will be able to control any event you care for in the real world, from every place, by simply accessing a special cloud space and immediately interacting with that event! It will be Awesome!<br/></p>
<p></p>This idea jumps over all limits if I introduce a least but not last concept. I am not alone!. We are not alone!. Maybe we have a family or maybe we have friends and we want, or simply we need to share or delegate with them this control .<br/><br/>The question becomes hard. What it is sure is that we don’t want to become an engineer or a tech specialist to realize this dream, and above all,  we do not want to spend time and money for it.<p></p>
<p><i><b>We simply need to improve our life quality, saving time,</b></i> simply acting, controlling, sharing and delegating actions from any place without moving, <i><b>simply using the network.</b></i></p>
<p>This
was my staring point, <b><i>this was the seed of ShareZeroSpace technology</i></b>, now developed into a tree.</p>

<h2>How does it works?<br/>
</h2>
<p>Now let me explain how the system works. You only need to have at least one ShareZeroSpace device composed by a standard core board + a standard multi purposes shield or a specialized functions shield.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1388384/files/20150416081235-board_cor_shield_photo.jpg?1429197155"" src="""" style=""""/>       <i>(Photo of SZS core board connected + multi pourposes shield on bottom)</i><br/></p>
<br/>
<p>You need then to connect the device to the internet network from one side and to the event you need to control on the other. The controlled events may for example be related to <b>electrical motor driven gates, light or light systems, socket or socket stripes, irrigation systems, electrical locks, heating or cooling systems.</b> Or they may consist in events that you need to supervise, such as access to controlled doors, water level controls, power or water metering systems or whatever else is furnished of  an input or output dialogue. The example below shows the capabilities of core SZS board + multi purposes in/out/temp shield.</p>

No problem, if you buy a micro-cloud server running SZS you can create your personal and even private SZS cloud. This mean you can put it in you private network and running it by controlling and sharing event like the world wide cloud on your private network. <br/>If you connect it to the internet (e.g. by your home adsl or wan) this will spread all over the world, and you can reach from any place, but remain your provate SZS cloud </p><p><b>Q</b>: After buy a SZS device, how I need to do for connect it to SZS cloud for control and share event connected to my SZS device</p><p><b>A:</b> What is needed is simply input the unicode serial string (proviced with yout SZS device) in the page ""Device"" after clicking add device. After this operation,you can assign descriptive names to your events and after configuring Ip address of yor network all is done. From now you'll find all event in your ""Zone"" page.  You can from now; control, share and delegate any event. SZS Cloud allow you can do everythings  from any device connected to the internet all over the world.<br/></p><p> <b>Q:</b> Why you think the product also without case?</p><p><b>A</b>: Because we consider the owner want to embed the SZS device in their appliance instead of place another case. However, we design the all-weather case for everytype of installation, inside and outside. In the future we plan to have a case for inside with better design.<br/></p><p><b>Q:</b> How long takes to electrically connect SZS device to an event?</p><p><b>A:</b> Depend on event. In most case, like the electric gate, the irrigations system, the garden lights, etc. is a question of minutes. Consider that digital output o SZS device consist in a relay with open-common-close contact. It's like to connect a standard switch. </p><p><b>Q:</b> Can I use SZS device like a smart house bus component?</p><p><b>A:</b> Yes, the SZS device can work like a smart house bus component. Configuring it with function ""digital input act on related digital output""  and all is done. Locally you'll connect the wall switch to digital input and the related digital output (relay) will work like a switch. From this point you can locally switching the charge (eg.lamp) with your old wall switch and remotely you can use SZS cloud  in your account for control the switch event. The output can work like a two state switch (open/close) or if you want like a push button with desidered hold time (programmable). The power stripe output wokr like this. Remotely you can control related output socket and locally the same using the small red button (see socket stripe demo's photo). Feedback on SZS cloud is always the true state of input or output.  </p><p><b>Q:</b> What type of internet connection need SZS device<br/><br/><b>A:</b> SZS device work with all type of internet connection from super slow 33.6K, to a fast 100M fiber optic. Every type such fixed ADSL, WAN, HDSL work well and for mobile applications GPRS, 3G, 4G are suitable. <br/>Traffic from SZS clousd and SZS device use a very small bandwith and the footrprint of SZS on your network is very small.<br/></p><p><b>Q: </b>What about SZS device in mobile use</p><p><b>A: </b>SZS device work perfecty in mobile use. The device can work with a low power supply (9-12 VDC@ 0.6A max with all relay engaged) and is suitable to work with battery operated or with energy saving system such battery and solar pannel. Communication with internet can be realized using a GPRS, 3G or 4G connection. If SZS device is equipped with a WiFi expansion, it can operate also using smartphone or portable router. This means you can use for eg. for control door car opening or anti theft solution for cutting fuel simply stopping electric fuel car pump.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>

Let the vision take control!""Share Zero Space is the new and revolutionary technology allow you to be protagonist in the; all over the world, event control!""



I'm
Mario, from Italy. I'm an entrepreneur and an inventor involved
in technology since 80' and also CEO of my companies Project Studio and Computer Design. I would like to change the way to approach solutions using a
smart point of view.



After many patents and time spent to understand what is really important and what we really need from technology I understood that the best thing we need is a smart tech  that permit to us to reach ubiquity. Imagine how cool it will be when you will be able to control any event you care for in the real world, from every place, by simply accessing a special cloud space and immediately interacting with that event! It will be Awesome!
This idea jumps over all limits if I introduce a least but not last concept. I am not alone!. We are not alone!. Maybe we have a family or maybe we have friends and we want, or simply we need to share or delegate with them this control .The question becomes hard. What it is sure is that we don’t want to become an engineer or a tech specialist to realize this dream, and above all,  we do not want to spend time and money for it.
We simply need to improve our life quality, saving time, simply acting, controlling, sharing and delegating actions from any place without moving, simply using the network.
This
was my staring point, this was the seed of ShareZeroSpace technology, now developed into a tree.
                                                       (Photo of SZS core board)  This board is the smart hardware core of SZS technology. This is the connector of real events to the SZS cloud. Since the internet network is now spread all over in the world (fixed or mobile) and it does not discriminate on speed or nations, once you have connected the SZS device to internet you have the full control of any event to which this device is locally connected.And this is the simpliest device with SZS technology inside that allow to transform a normal power-stripe to a smart 4 socket power-stripe.    (This SZS smart 4 socket power stripe used in demo is also available as a perk!)Using the cloud portal and a super-simple multilanguages graphic user interface, on tablet, mobile smartphone or PC's, you can interact with the event, fully freeing the power of Share Zero Space vision. 
               (Here pictured a space zone of user account. This is the place for                                controlling event also with a webcam vision) 

How does it works?

Now let me explain how the system works. You only need to have at least one ShareZeroSpace device composed by a standard core board + a standard multi purposes shield or a specialized functions shield.
       (Photo of SZS core board connected + multi pourposes shield on bottom)

You need then to connect the device to the internet network from one side and to the event you need to control on the other. The controlled events may for example be related to electrical motor driven gates, light or light systems, socket or socket stripes, irrigation systems, electrical locks, heating or cooling systems. Or they may consist in events that you need to supervise, such as access to controlled doors, water level controls, power or water metering systems or whatever else is furnished of  an input or output dialogue. The example below shows the capabilities of core SZS board + multi purposes in/out/temp shield.
This stage will require in most cases ten minutes of work by a non super-tech user, may be you or your electrician, or zero minutes by buying a ready to use device, such the power strip exhibit on demo.


                                            ( SZS in all-weather case with dimension)Then you need to register your new ShareZeroSpace device on the cloud, and, after a ultra simple localized language configuration, all is done.
No specialized devices, no apps, no software, no servers, no long time learning curve. By means of any kind of internet connected device, such as mobile phones, tablets, PC’s, internet totems, etc., you can access your ShareZeroSpace zone using your personal account. Immediately, you be able to operate on your controlled event through a simple and powerful graphic interface.
You can have multiple ShareZeroSpace devices connected and joined to your account in multiple place all over the world. Awesome superpower!.

But, if you remember, we said, we are not alone. So we introduce the opportunity, with no complications, with no overwork, with no wast of time, to share every single controlled event with others, to delegate and allow others to control atspecfied times signle event connected to the ShareZeroSpace device.The friend or delegate will be authorized and alerted with a mail that includes the appropriate information. From this point on, your friend can interact with event, and you, if you desire, will be warned anytime. The cool side is that your shared-event friends, in their ZSZ zone on their accounts, can find and use the shared event. When you desire to stop the sharing, with a simple action you can cancel it. Finally you can also be warned if something has changed by e-mail ( we plan in the future to integrate a sms alert function) if someting event  has changed status, like a opened SZS controlled door or a electric motor failure when SZS will be adopted for check power overcharge.Since also other people may have an account and multiple SZS device under their control, also they can share with you the control of events. It's like a social network of things, instead of a social network of words. You can do what you want no matter of community (share), no matter of time (zero), no matter of distance (space). We are designing a special functionality that permits in the future the release of software to share and interact with SZS technology directly by common socials network.The vision emerging from ShareZeroSpace is that with zero time (without waiting) and zero space (without moving) we can interact with real world events, sharing the resource. That's all.Simple, sure, instantly and primarily all, smart!.If you help us joining this campaign, we help you not only to enjoy of this smart solution, but we together can really change our way to enjoy life and have more free time and fun!.Together we can make the difference from suffer the technology to steer technology!

No problem, if you buy a micro-cloud server running SZS you can create your personal and even private SZS cloud. This mean you can put it in you private network and running it by controlling and sharing event like the world wide cloud on your private network. If you connect it to the internet (e.g. by your home adsl or wan) this will spread all over the world, and you can reach from any place, but remain your provate SZS cloud Q: After buy a SZS device, how I need to do for connect it to SZS cloud for control and share event connected to my SZS deviceA: What is needed is simply input the unicode serial string (proviced with yout SZS device) in the page ""Device"" after clicking add device. After this operation,you can assign descriptive names to your events and after configuring Ip address of yor network all is done. From now you'll find all event in your ""Zone"" page.  You can from now; control, share and delegate any event. SZS Cloud allow you can do everythings  from any device connected to the internet all over the world. Q: Why you think the product also without case?A: Because we consider the owner want to embed the SZS device in their appliance instead of place another case. However, we design the all-weather case for everytype of installation, inside and outside. In the future we plan to have a case for inside with better design.Q: How long takes to electrically connect SZS device to an event?A: Depend on event. In most case, like the electric gate, the irrigations system, the garden lights, etc. is a question of minutes. Consider that digital output o SZS device consist in a relay with open-common-close contact. It's like to connect a standard switch. Q: Can I use SZS device like a smart house bus component?A: Yes, the SZS device can work like a smart house bus component. Configuring it with function ""digital input act on related digital output""  and all is done. Locally you'll connect the wall switch to digital input and the related digital output (relay) will work like a switch. From this point you can locally switching the charge (eg.lamp) with your old wall switch and remotely you can use SZS cloud  in your account for control the switch event. The output can work like a two state switch (open/close) or if you want like a push button with desidered hold time (programmable). The power stripe output wokr like this. Remotely you can control related output socket and locally the same using the small red button (see socket stripe demo's photo). Feedback on SZS cloud is always the true state of input or output.  Q: What type of internet connection need SZS deviceA: SZS device work with all type of internet connection from super slow 33.6K, to a fast 100M fiber optic. Every type such fixed ADSL, WAN, HDSL work well and for mobile applications GPRS, 3G, 4G are suitable. Traffic from SZS clousd and SZS device use a very small bandwith and the footrprint of SZS on your network is very small.Q: What about SZS device in mobile useA: SZS device work perfecty in mobile use. The device can work with a low power supply (9-12 VDC@ 0.6A max with all relay engaged) and is suitable to work with battery operated or with energy saving system such battery and solar pannel. Communication with internet can be realized using a GPRS, 3G or 4G connection. If SZS device is equipped with a WiFi expansion, it can operate also using smartphone or portable router. This means you can use for eg. for control door car opening or anti theft solution for cutting fuel simply stopping electric fuel car pump.",14.0,0,"3 Campaigns

</div><p>Anderson’s Bookshop is a 6th generation family owned business in the Chicago area and this year we celebrated our 50th year! Our history dates back to 1875 when our great-great grandfather opened a Pharmacy in Naperville, Illinois and started selling books on the second floor. In 1964 our grandfather opened our first official bookstore above the drugstore, calling it Paperback Paradise. Since then we have moved to a separate location in downtown Naperville and opened a location in Downers Grove and became Anderson's Bookshop. </p><p>Anderson’s Bookshop strives for more than being just a bookstore. We want to share a passion and knowledge of books to create lifelong readers. To provide a place where the exchange of ideas and thoughts have a diverse playing field. To be a destination for our community to keep open the dialogue of free speech and free expression. To be a part of our greater community in support of education. And to be a place of good company, great reads, and engaging conversations for everyone.<br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433186182/lu0du5bfs4saiz3hng3x.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div> <p></p>In return for your support, you’ll be one of the few to own an exclusive, t-shirt, tote bag or mug with artwork created exclusively for this campaign.

I Built a Bookshop is a project to develop a brand new independent, community-involved bookshop in La Grange, Illinois. There’s a range one-of-a-kind donation perks for you to choose from, with all proceeds going toward building the new store.
Anderson’s Bookshop is a 6th generation family owned business in the Chicago area and this year we celebrated our 50th year! Our history dates back to 1875 when our great-great grandfather opened a Pharmacy in Naperville, Illinois and started selling books on the second floor. In 1964 our grandfather opened our first official bookstore above the drugstore, calling it Paperback Paradise. Since then we have moved to a separate location in downtown Naperville and opened a location in Downers Grove and became Anderson's Bookshop. Anderson’s Bookshop strives for more than being just a bookstore. We want to share a passion and knowledge of books to create lifelong readers. To provide a place where the exchange of ideas and thoughts have a diverse playing field. To be a destination for our community to keep open the dialogue of free speech and free expression. To be a part of our greater community in support of education. And to be a place of good company, great reads, and engaging conversations for everyone. In return for your support, you’ll be one of the few to own an exclusive, t-shirt, tote bag or mug with artwork created exclusively for this campaign. All created and designed by a local artist. Or you could choose a “Golden Ticket” that guarantees you autographed books and the first spots in line to meet authors of your choosing!

</ul> </div>","MSS KITS is a recently created UK based engineering technology
brand specialising in the development of tailored adjustable performance spring
kits primarily aimed at prestige German cars with factory (OE) electronic (active)
suspensions - Audi MagneRide™, BMW EDC™, Porsche PASM/S™ and VW ACC/DCC™.







We develop Premium Fully Adjustable Performance Spring systems in
partnership with Eibach and key partners. Find below an infographic on the eight key benefits. 
We offer four distinctive types of performance spring kits to meet each individual needs, MSS Streets, MSS Sports, MSS Track Pack and MSS 'LS'  explained below. 

MSS Streets is our most popular, compliant riding and ideal kit for the
daily commute or regular open roads drive as shown in the customer road test video below. The occasional trip to a race circuit can be accomplished competently, which is what our customers tell us. It is a well rounded and well received product.
MSS Sports is
our signature product and the most versatile kit we offer. Use for the Monday to Friday commute however, at the weekends, it is the perfect solution for the regular track going sports car. This kit was on our Development car for three years which we constantly evolved to get the product as it stands now. 
MSS Track Pack enables higher speed cornering; later braking; sharper turn-in. This kit enables the chassis to cope well with the challenges
a race circuit offers. Don't take our word for it, watch the video below of our test race driver, Nick, lapping cars during this short demo ride given to Tim of SHMEE150...fab! &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;h3&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;What Car Makes and Models are available today?

Below is our planned 2015 products release schedule for VW and Audi cars.




Suspension engineering is complicated because there are vehicle load capability, weight and
damper travel tolerances to take in to consideration with any design. 

We have 5-years experience in the design and development of our products
supported by Eibach, our chosen spring manufacturer with over 60-years spring
technology experience. Combined, we have in place well rehearsed processes which has helped mitigate
known manufacturing, testing and product launch risks. 
Manufacturing

The quality of our CNC parts have been widely commented on by customers and we are proud to use quality raw material, which cost a little more to produce. We want to continue using quality raw material however it requires money.Eibach manufacture springs to our exacting specifications from their TUV
approved world-class facilities in Germany - used by Formula 1; Indycar; WRC
Rally, DTM, MotoGP, Nascar (to name but a few) race teams. We know we
have the right spring manufacturer and customer feedback indicates that we have the right choice.  Development and Testing
Each kit developed goes through a series of tough road and track tests which requires time and money. Our aim is to continue with these thorough processes.",52.0,2,"1 Campaign

<span><b>Who are we?</b>
<br/>We are antifascists based in the Midlands, UK – currently in Birmingham,
Coventry, Leicester and Nottingham- who are committed to challenging
fascism, nationalism, racism, Islamophobia and anti-Semitism.

<br/><b><br/>What do we believe?</b>
<br/>We need to be proactive against fascism- this means no longer relying on
the empty promises made by politicians that leave working class and
communities of colour out in the cold. Fascism is used by the ruling
class – rich people and 'decision makers' like politicians – to pit
everyday people against each other based on the colour of their skin or
which country they have travelled from. Fascism does nothing to
alleviate the conditions of working class people, and relies on working
class division and fear to thrive. We believe in tackling fascism
physically, during demonstrations, outside of demonstrations, to have
anti-racist messages seen in the built-environment and promote
cooperative, egalitarian modes of being. Bringing the community
together to educate each other and build networks of solidarity is what
Midlands Antifascists is about.

<br/><br/><b>Why fundraise?</b>
<br/>There's a lot of work to be done, so, taking the lead from our
antifascist comrades in London, we've decided to start fundraising
online. Funds will be needed for posters, leaflets, banners, stickers,
merchandise, transport for travelling to antifascist demonstrations
around the country, room booking fees for community meetings, and any
other resources needed for direct action.

Even if you may not have the funds yourself to make a donation, then do
make sure you share this page with other supporters and comrades! If
you'd like to get involved as well, or you know people who've been
involved with antifascist action in the Midlands, please send them our
way! We're looking to expand to other towns and cities, and to reach the
point where groups are strong enough we can cover smaller areas.

We are a collection of people with many backgrounds all coming together to build a local farm where farming was not even possible before.  We are working in a facility that has been a diesel repair shop, a cultured marble manufacture and a boat building shop.  All of these entities have damaged the soil and the local environment to the point that traditional farming is not possible. We are working towards building a large aquaponic farm that will not only allow us to grow, but outgrow larger farms! All using less water, no pesticides and no man made fertilizers! Another plus is we are local so our transportation needs to the customer will be small compared to the traditional ways! We don't think about the cost of moving vegies from across the country!  Fish and produce growing in a closed ecosystem makes this possible.</p>
<p>Help us:</p>
<p>1. Improve local food production!</p>
<p>2. Create local jobs! ( we will have to hire helpers and delivery drivers soon)</p>
<p>3. Improve health with better foods! </p>
<p>4. Help other local farms with our CSA!</p>
<p>5. Work towards teaching others to grow like we grow!</p>
<p>6. Clean up a small part of the environment!</p>
<p>7. Help Improve local food security!</p>
<p>8. Start a new farm where one couldn't have happened before!</p>
<p>9. Help local food charities by giving them fresh good foods!</p>
<p>Who are we?</p>

<p>Frank Savage</p>
<p>Frank has been a production engineer, a plastic manufacturing engineer, a boat builder and a mechanic. Franks engineering and knowledge of building and repurposing of materials gives us a unique  knowledge and experience base in building and maintaining the systems of aquaponics. </p>
<p>Steve Savage</p>
<p>Steve brings an amazing array of assets to the table. Steve has many years in fiberglass manufacturing and boat building. Steve also bring many years experience in repurposing materials and non tradition techniques in construction.  Steve also has extensive electrical and electronic knowledge. Building greenhouse, setting up pumping and building of tanks and growbeds are just a few things that Steve gives to the team. He and his brother Frank have run there own shop for close to 30 years so they also bring the business knowledge to the table.</p>

<p>So why do we need the money? The start up of this type of farm is not cheap. Traditional funding channels still see it on the fringe and don't want to invest. Its funny that we can change the way we grow food but the banks and farm loan people don't want to lead the charge. That why we are coming to the people and giving you the chance to change the world!! We are in the process of building a 20 foot by 90 foot green house and buying or building the pieces of the aquaponics. That's were you help us! Your money goes to construction and start up costs. That's were all the money is going.  Yes this is a business, but one that knows that it cant live without the community its in and the people it grows for.  Even $5 to $10 dollar contributions help! It all goes to the goal of getting Southern Green up and running</p>
<p> </p>
</div></div>","WE WILL DONATE 1 POUND OF FOOD FOR EVERY DOLLAR DONATED!!!!!

We will donate to an Atlanta area food pantry or food outreach for every dollar donated!Helping our local community, changing the farming model and being environmentally more responsible is what Southern Green Farms is all about. We want to build a model aquaponic vertical facility to teach others to grow like this and help localize food production.





We are a collection of people with many backgrounds all coming together to build a local farm where farming was not even possible before.  We are working in a facility that has been a diesel repair shop, a cultured marble manufacture and a boat building shop.  All of these entities have damaged the soil and the local environment to the point that traditional farming is not possible. We are working towards building a large aquaponic farm that will not only allow us to grow, but outgrow larger farms! All using less water, no pesticides and no man made fertilizers! Another plus is we are local so our transportation needs to the customer will be small compared to the traditional ways! We don't think about the cost of moving vegies from across the country!  Fish and produce growing in a closed ecosystem makes this possible.
Help us:
1. Improve local food production!
2. Create local jobs! ( we will have to hire helpers and delivery drivers soon)
3. Improve health with better foods! 
4. Help other local farms with our CSA!
5. Work towards teaching others to grow like we grow!
6. Clean up a small part of the environment!
7. Help Improve local food security!
8. Start a new farm where one couldn't have happened before!
9. Help local food charities by giving them fresh good foods!
Who are we?

Chris Cadle, 
Chris was an automechanic for 18 years but has also been a gardener and raised livestock most of his life. Chris Started his first aquaponic system in his bedroom many years ago. It was a small beginning that lit a passion for sustainable green farming. He has been part of several local farming ventures including 413 farms and Sunshines Egg farms.
Sabrina Payne-Cadle
Chris's spouse is very active also in agriculture. Sabrina has been an Organic dirt farmer and a poultry farmer in Georgia. She has managed a commercial egg farm as well raised her own organic produce farm making her a great part of the team. Sabrina also helped in construction of 413 farms. She owned and managed Sunshines Egg Farms plus helped Chris set up and manage there first CSA.
Frank Savage
Frank has been a production engineer, a plastic manufacturing engineer, a boat builder and a mechanic. Franks engineering and knowledge of building and repurposing of materials gives us a unique  knowledge and experience base in building and maintaining the systems of aquaponics. 
Steve Savage
Steve brings an amazing array of assets to the table. Steve has many years in fiberglass manufacturing and boat building. Steve also bring many years experience in repurposing materials and non tradition techniques in construction.  Steve also has extensive electrical and electronic knowledge. Building greenhouse, setting up pumping and building of tanks and growbeds are just a few things that Steve gives to the team. He and his brother Frank have run there own shop for close to 30 years so they also bring the business knowledge to the table.

</div><p></p><h3>Short story about myself</h3><p>Hello there! My name is Alexandru Cîrstoiu. I was born in Romania back in 1989 with muscular dystrophy, a degenerative condition that slowly destroys most muscles and has no cure. The illness has a really deceitful start and, so, until around the age of 6, I was a perfectly healthy boy. But then I started falling at random moments for no reason. My legs would suddenly lose all strength and I would drop on my knee. The falling was shortly followed by difficulty going up or down the stairs and lifting myself up, as well the inability to jump.</p><p>After the first symptoms, my parents notice something was wrong and they took me to a neurologist, and that's when I was first diagnosed with muscular dystrophy. At this moment in time the doctors thought it was the far less brutal form call Becker, but judging by how fast it was advancing they decided to take a biopsy. When the result came in, it couldn't have been worse; I had Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the nastiest and more lethal one of the bunch, with an average life expectancy of 25.</p><p>Hearing this kind of news when you're a child changes you, makes you see the concept of life differently. It ends up either crushing you and erasing any trace of hope or making you fight harder to survive and become a stronger person. The latter is hard to achieve, considering the degenerative nature of the illness, you stand there watching as each day you lose a piece of yourself. As such, by the age of 10, I was already bound to a wheelchair.</p><p>As any parents would do, mine too went through a period of denial, where they refuse to accept that their child had an incurable condition. And so we visited countless hospitals and tried numerous alternative remedies, which unfortunately meant my sister spent most of this time back at home with grandma, far from us. Eventually though we had to face reality and move forward.</p><p>So my family settled for the next best thing, helping me get a proper education. This is why I managed graduating University and even getting a Master's degree. It wasn't without expenses though. As my condition worsened we had to change several cars, which meant taking a loan that we are still paying even today. When you add to that the expenses with the different treatments I have tried, it adds up to a hefty amount over the years.</p><p></p><h3>What exactly do I need help with</h3><p>My entire life I have lived in an apartment situated at third floor, so the whole time I was in school, my parents had to carry me down and up the stairs close to everyday. It was even harder for my mom during the times when my dad would work; carrying someone taller than yourself is not an easy task for a woman.</p><p>But just like everybody does, my parents are growing older,the years of carrying me has had its toll on them and it's harder and harder to take me outside. This means I now spend most of my days in my room with the exception of the times I go for my medical checkups.</p><p>And this is why I need a house, a place where I can easily go outside without too much of an effort and that's more suited for my needs, the needs of a person mostly stuck in a bed because he doesn't really have easy access to the other rooms.</p><p>Unfortunately my country does little when it comes to helping disabled people get their on place that can actually improve their quality of life. The only thing the state has helped me with since becoming an adult is a monthly sum of 175$ or 140€, which is not enough to even live off of, never mind trying to get a home with that.</p><p>So here I am, humbly coming to ask for your help in my quest to getting a home.</p><div>

free; we wish for everyone to have access to some proper nutritional information
and a possibility to create healthy diets with ease.

<p>Seriously, youcan benefit from using Fudbot no matter what your
level of success or occupation is. With the free version you can fix your diet
to be a better one, without any required knowledge of nutritional science. With
the pro version, whether you are a personal trainer, a doctor, a nurse or a guru
of everything, you can help others to make even more complex diet plans.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Could there BE any challenges? </h3>
<p>Well, yes. The ethnical and culinary diversity in the world is vast,
so there must be a huge food database to cover the different needs of various
countries and continents with their unique natural sources and farming
products. There will be a tool for everyone to use and add foods to the
database. This is probably the easiest way to globalize the food database, so
our Japanese friends won't need to wonder about Finnish traditional pastries
and so on. However, we will moderate everything that will be added to database,
so you will not find anything like lembas or chocolate salty balls in there. </p>
<p></p>
<h3>No cash? </h3>
<p>So you are running short of everything but still want to help?
No worries! Just use Indiegogo’s share tools and let the world know of
Fudbot. </p>

our Japanese friends won't need to wonder about Finnish traditional pastries
and so on. However, we will moderate everything that will be added to database,
so you will not find anything like lembas or chocolate salty balls in there.

<p><b>Luis &amp; Caterina Manriquez</b>: In the area of Huilo Huilo there
was no possibility of canyoning until Luis Manriquez came up with the idea.
Together with his sister Caterina, they are offering this sport that includes descending
down by rivers, waterfalls and others, for the tourists who want to experience
an adrenaline-filled activity. Luis and Caterina were one of the winners in the first social program that Smartrip and Emprediem made in 2012 with the entrepreneurs in Huilo Huilo, with the support of Huilo Huilo Hotels.</p>
<p><u>What they need?</u>: increase their equipment (suits, helmets,

they are innovative, passionate, persevering and optimistic, and they need our
help to be able to  overcome obstacles
and enlarge their business.
In Smartrip
(www.smartrip.cl), a travel agency with social focus ,
we have worked with this group of small entrepreneurs before through several social
programs:  Balloon Chile in alliance with the B Corp, Emprediem ( six programs
in different destinations, + 800 entrepreneurs supported, www.balloonchile.com) and ""Más Artesanía Local"" in alliance with TKO consultores (www.turistiko.cl two programs in different destinations + 30
craftsmen supported).
For this crowdfunding
campaign we have selected the people we know from our social programs. We have
witnessed their commitment and the tremendous potential they have. We know that
additional support is required in order to make it possible to fulfill their
dreams, and to be able to continue rescuing their culture and local identity
through their work.
Smartrip - About UsWe are a
travel agency with a social focus, and we aim to finance social projects in
major tourist destinations in Chile. We have partnerships with a group of
leading hotels (https://www.smartrip.cl/paginas/hoteles) that gives us special conditions to sell their available rooms,
to support this social purpose. + 50 hotels partners committed with local
developmentSmartrip

- campaign, our partner hotels have donated free nights in their rooms as a
reward for those who make their contributions to the campaign. In addition to
the hotel nights and the unique products that our small entrepreneurs produce,
Smartrip is donating also hundreds of Travel Gift Cards. These prizes make it
even more interesting for the people who not only want to help the local small entrepreneurs
in need, but also want to travel with sustainability.All the
profits that we are going to raise with this campaign will be divided among the
entrepreneurs, depending on their needs which were surveyed on a detailed
diagnosis for  each of them. If we exceed
our goal, we can support more entrepreneurs from other tourist destinations in
Chile.

dream, together with the other craftsmen, is to have a place where we can work better.
We also need more advertising to make us known widely""

empezó a incursionar el volcán Sollipulli. Quedó tan impresionada con los

The purpose behind this coffee shop is to advance higher level education in Nicaragua by providing training, part time work and to support college students currently studying in Nicaragua.</span></p><p><b>About Us<br/></b><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Nadia Garcia, is from Nicaragua and has a degree and Economics and an MBA at Thomas More university. After being in the market place for 2 years  and getting trained at UMD university in Minnesota she pioneered a campus based organization called Chi Alpha in Nicaragua and has been the director for the past 10 years. Her other work includes Habitat for Humanity, the Ministry of Statistics and Census in Nicaragua, and procurement for Vapensa- Serquimsa. She is passionate about working with college students and assisting them in their personal and professional lives.</span></p><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Slavik Melnik has a Bachelor’s degree in Supply Chain Management and he is a Certified Associate in Project Management. He is passionate about creating positive social change with small business enterprises. He joined the team when he first visited Nicaragua for a 3 month volunteering trip  to work with university students for teaching English and volunteering with Chi Alpha. While serving in Nicaragua he clearly saw the need to create opportunities for the students and wanted to work on this project to make it a reality.</span></p><p><b>The Impact<br/></b><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Through the past 10 years of experience working with students Nadia has seen many challenges that students face in order to stay in college. On rare occasions a student may be able to find a full time job to support themselves or help support their family. But for most students that is not a feasible option and part time work is currently non-existent across Nicaragua. Often times when family is not able to pay for education the students have no option but to drop out of the university. This challenge can be overcome with a simple part time job that would allow a student to earn an income while they continue to go to the university.<br/><br/></span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">This is where Alpha Cup Cafe comes in with your help. Our intent is to structure the business so that it is a self sustaining cafe that will employ 10-15 part time baristas. By partnering with us you will help many students to complete their degrees successfully. There will also be opportunities for students from US and around the world to experience a different culture and volunteer for short term trips in Nicaragua. This is Alpha Cup Cafe’s first location and it is a big step to making a positive impact in the community.</span></p><p><b>What We Need<br/></b><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">We need an estimated of $120,000 to open this coffee shop. $30,000 for the equipment, $30,000 for remodeling (will vary based on the final location selection) $20,000 for furniture, $45,000 for first three months of operating expenses and salaries and $5,000 for startup inventory. Currently we already have $45,000 from direct investments and we are looking to fundraise $75,000 more through crowdfunding (after the cost of  the products).</span></p><p><b>The Risks and Challenges</b><br/><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">If anyone has run a coffee shop they know that it can be challenging to break even with operating expense in this industry. After surveying the industry in Nicaragua we have noticed that many improvements can be made in this industry that will enable us to be competitive because the market is not yet saturated as in United States. Furthermore, 3 months of operating expenses will provide us with enough time to refine our business and operations for profitability. The second challenge is location. Coffee shop owners know that it is all about location. The plan is to open Alpha Cup Cafe in a location nearby a university and visible from a busy intersection and shopping center in Managua with a great amount of foot traffic. Recently there is an influx of over a million tourists coming through Nicaragua every year. By opening near a busy area and developing center in Managua we will be able to ensure future growth and success. We have received great advice and feedback from coffee shop and restaurant owners from United States as well as in Nicaragua. And with many insights and suggestions from our advisors we are confident we can overcome all of theses challenges.</span></p><p><b>Our Vision</b><br/><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Our vision is to partner with college students to make a positive influence in the community and in the business sector. We see Alpha Cup Cafe eventually going outside of the walls of the coffee shop to partner with other organizations such as Chi Alpha to nurture better community and establishing other development projects in our area. Furthermore we also hope that other businesses will begin to replicate our model and also begin to provide part time work to college students. </span></p><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><b>Support Us Today!<br/></b></span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Help us reach our goal of $100,000 on Indiegogo by partnering with us at one of the levels. </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">You can also your support by sharing this page with your friends and family and on Facebook. You will provide us with enough funding to position Alpha Cup Cafe as the leader in the industry for quality of coffee and service, fair wages, social change, and part time job opportunities.</span></p><p><b>Biggest Thank You and Many Blessings,</b></p><p><b>Alpha Cup Cafe Team</b></p><br/><p><b>Contact us at: </b><a href=""mailto:alphacupcafe@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">alphacupcafe@gmail.com</a></p><p><b><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/alphacupcafe"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Also follow us on Facebook :-) </a></b></p><div><b>Perks:</b></div><div>

</div></div>","Alpha Cup Cafe in NicaraguaWe are starting a coffee shop in Nicaragua, and we want you to be part of it. The purpose behind this coffee shop is to advance higher level education in Nicaragua by providing training, part time work and to support college students currently studying in Nicaragua.About UsNadia Garcia, is from Nicaragua and has a degree and Economics and an MBA at Thomas More university. After being in the market place for 2 years  and getting trained at UMD university in Minnesota she pioneered a campus based organization called Chi Alpha in Nicaragua and has been the director for the past 10 years. Her other work includes Habitat for Humanity, the Ministry of Statistics and Census in Nicaragua, and procurement for Vapensa- Serquimsa. She is passionate about working with college students and assisting them in their personal and professional lives.Slavik Melnik has a Bachelor’s degree in Supply Chain Management and he is a Certified Associate in Project Management. He is passionate about creating positive social change with small business enterprises. He joined the team when he first visited Nicaragua for a 3 month volunteering trip  to work with university students for teaching English and volunteering with Chi Alpha. While serving in Nicaragua he clearly saw the need to create opportunities for the students and wanted to work on this project to make it a reality.The ImpactThrough the past 10 years of experience working with students Nadia has seen many challenges that students face in order to stay in college. On rare occasions a student may be able to find a full time job to support themselves or help support their family. But for most students that is not a feasible option and part time work is currently non-existent across Nicaragua. Often times when family is not able to pay for education the students have no option but to drop out of the university. This challenge can be overcome with a simple part time job that would allow a student to earn an income while they continue to go to the university.This is where Alpha Cup Cafe comes in with your help. Our intent is to structure the business so that it is a self sustaining cafe that will employ 10-15 part time baristas. By partnering with us you will help many students to complete their degrees successfully. There will also be opportunities for students from US and around the world to experience a different culture and volunteer for short term trips in Nicaragua. This is Alpha Cup Cafe’s first location and it is a big step to making a positive impact in the community.What We NeedWe need an estimated of $120,000 to open this coffee shop. $30,000 for the equipment, $30,000 for remodeling (will vary based on the final location selection) $20,000 for furniture, $45,000 for first three months of operating expenses and salaries and $5,000 for startup inventory. Currently we already have $45,000 from direct investments and we are looking to fundraise $75,000 more through crowdfunding (after the cost of  the products).The Risks and ChallengesIf anyone has run a coffee shop they know that it can be challenging to break even with operating expense in this industry. After surveying the industry in Nicaragua we have noticed that many improvements can be made in this industry that will enable us to be competitive because the market is not yet saturated as in United States. Furthermore, 3 months of operating expenses will provide us with enough time to refine our business and operations for profitability. The second challenge is location. Coffee shop owners know that it is all about location. The plan is to open Alpha Cup Cafe in a location nearby a university and visible from a busy intersection and shopping center in Managua with a great amount of foot traffic. Recently there is an influx of over a million tourists coming through Nicaragua every year. By opening near a busy area and developing center in Managua we will be able to ensure future growth and success. We have received great advice and feedback from coffee shop and restaurant owners from United States as well as in Nicaragua. And with many insights and suggestions from our advisors we are confident we can overcome all of theses challenges.Our VisionOur vision is to partner with college students to make a positive influence in the community and in the business sector. We see Alpha Cup Cafe eventually going outside of the walls of the coffee shop to partner with other organizations such as Chi Alpha to nurture better community and establishing other development projects in our area. Furthermore we also hope that other businesses will begin to replicate our model and also begin to provide part time work to college students. Support Us Today!Help us reach our goal of $100,000 on Indiegogo by partnering with us at one of the levels. You can also your support by sharing this page with your friends and family and on Facebook. You will provide us with enough funding to position Alpha Cup Cafe as the leader in the industry for quality of coffee and service, fair wages, social change, and part time job opportunities.Biggest Thank You and Many Blessings,Alpha Cup Cafe TeamContact us at: alphacupcafe@gmail.comAlso follow us on Facebook :-) Perks:

leaders get things done.</h4>
<p>Two examples:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">1) 
A small group of regular people got an indoor swimming
pool built in a tiny rural community. At first, no one thought it was a good
idea, but after many meetings and phone calls, the community rallied behind it.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">2) 
Another small group saw a need to bring
awareness and support to the many people who came from around the world to help
build Canada. This was in a small farming town where people didn’t really love
immigrants much (okay there was rampant racism). After many community meetings, lots of phone calls, posters, a
formal proposal to the County, the Stony Plain Multicultural Heritage Centre became a reality (""Centre"" is the Canadian spelling) . <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p><p>Here's a ""before"" pic:</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1451339897/fc1yss9ymy6vzgyqhoki.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>And today:<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1451339921/ui5spwdfdwbccqaqo3of.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>It was amazing. </p><p>And it was really hard to do, mostly because the
tools to communicate and rally support and make a plan just weren’t there. That
was 40 years ago, and the Stony Plain Multicultural Centre is still going
strong today. If that small group had had Syntention, they would have had an
easier time. They would have been able to do more.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>We wonder:</b></p><p>How many great things <b>don’t</b> get done because dreamers, builders, and community leaders don’t have
something like Syntention to help them?</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">How many times have you seen something appalling or disheartening, and
wished you could actually do something about it? How many times has everyone around the world wished they could actually do something?</p>
<p>It’s uncountable.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">All the lost opportunities; the unnecessary suffering around the
world; the strife that we didn’t have to go through – it all makes us shiver. We know... you, too.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>
<h3><b>Let’s do something about it.</b></h3>
<p>Now that we all have the ability to develop Syntention together,
shouldn’t we? So that once and for all we all have the ability to do what needs

Do you want regular people to be able to change the world?
Regular people, everywhere.Your world and your neighborhood.
How many great things don’t get done because dreamers, builders, and community leaders don’t have something like Syntention to help them?
.Since the beginning,people have yearned for a wayto make things better. 
People everywhere have always wanted to make decisions that work best for them. Governments, dictators, multi-nationals, and the political establishment have rarely had your best interests at heart. (Is that putting it mildly?).




So how about if anyone or any group could propose a change, or an improvement to their local community, or the world as a whole? Gather support, get together, plan how to get it done, and do it?
Syntention lets us do that.

Syntention isonce and for allhow people everywhere will choose their futureand actually make it happen.Locally and globally.
People want to improve the world, or their local community,
or both. The words people use to describe how they feel are very powerful. Often, those words boil down to fear and hope...  People
who want something better really care about it.
It could be a global issue, like improving how countries treat refugees, or ending poverty, as UN Leader Ban Ki-moon's T-shirt says in the pic above.But it doesn’t have to be earth-shaking to be important.Need more daycare spaces in your community? Is there a dead space in your neighborhood that could be transformed into a park? Or maybe you wish a company would offer an additional service (breakfast all day at your favorite fast food place!!). Maybe you want to build a path through the wilderness:
We expect local Missions will be more
numerous than global Missions.
Syntention is the place for action......beyond petitions, which can feel like begging at the feet of the powerful.Plan how to gather support, and from where. Then together, plan how to get it done. Build a budget. Fund it. Assign tasks. Track progress. Celebrate success. All in one place.


Here's a quote from Rahul Gandhi: 
""Give a government all the power you want. Give it everything. It cannot solve the problems of a billion people. Give a billion people the power to solve their problems and it will be done immediately."" 

Team MembersSyntention’s founders are Warrick Harrison - that's me! - and Preethi Ram. Preethi has the business education to hold everything together and the passion to drive it. She's also a pretty good presenter, which will soon be vital. Fun fact: she also speaks 5 languages, so you should be able to chat with her! We both have an HR background, which will be a huge help. I have a dozen years of experience as a professional leader of Volunteers, so I know: Dedicated people get amazing things done. I helped develop
a couple of organizations from scratch. I also built a web-based platform (ClientPlaza), so you know I can bring a tech enterprise to launch. Here's ClientPlaza's logo, just for fun:.Growing up on the Canadian prairies, I saw informal community
leaders get things done.
Two examples:
1) 
A small group of regular people got an indoor swimming
pool built in a tiny rural community. At first, no one thought it was a good
idea, but after many meetings and phone calls, the community rallied behind it.
2) 
Another small group saw a need to bring
awareness and support to the many people who came from around the world to help
build Canada. This was in a small farming town where people didn’t really love
immigrants much (okay there was rampant racism). After many community meetings, lots of phone calls, posters, a
formal proposal to the County, the Stony Plain Multicultural Heritage Centre became a reality (""Centre"" is the Canadian spelling) . Here's a ""before"" pic:And today:It was amazing. And it was really hard to do, mostly because the
tools to communicate and rally support and make a plan just weren’t there. That
was 40 years ago, and the Stony Plain Multicultural Centre is still going
strong today. If that small group had had Syntention, they would have had an
easier time. They would have been able to do more.
We wonder:How many great things don’t get done because dreamers, builders, and community leaders don’t have
something like Syntention to help them?
How many times have you seen something appalling or disheartening, and
wished you could actually do something about it? How many times has everyone around the world wished they could actually do something?
It’s uncountable.
All the lost opportunities; the unnecessary suffering around the
world; the strife that we didn’t have to go through – it all makes us shiver. We know... you, too.
Let’s do something about it.
Now that we all have the ability to develop Syntention together,
shouldn’t we? So that once and for all we all have the ability to do what needs
doing.
Whatever comes up, almost anywhere around the world – we can
make things better.
We can make a decision, make a plan to get it done, budget
it, fund it, assign tasks, track progress, and celebrate success. All of that
in one place.

We'll go ahead, and continue fundraising as required. If there isn't enough support to justify the risk, then we'll have to reassess.

Short term vision

<div>First, you may be asking yourself ""what is a croft?"" In short, according to Webster's dictionary, a ""croft"" is: ""a small farm worked by a tenant.""</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Harp &amp; Shamrock Croft, LLC, est. 2013, is simply on a journey to realize with hard work and dedication anyone can accomplish what they set out to do. For us, our goal is to continue to expand in size and grow larger quantities of our product for the community to enjoy.<br/><br/>As of today, much of the expansion has been achieved by reinvesting every dollar earned back into the business from the selling of produce. The 2015 market season was a sheer joy as our products grabbed the attention of not only the market community but many local residents and shoppers in the area. What is unique about us is that we measure everything in square feet given our various growing areas, allowing us to give immediate care to each garden. By the beginning of the 2016 growing season, which is right around the corner, we will be tackling almost 10,000 square feet of actual growing space. Needless to say, we have BIG plans. But we need YOU as a partner to make this happen.<br/><p><br/></p>

<h3>Pawsitivity in the city of Knoxville</h3>
<p>Hello to each and everyone of you who have found this page! To begin with introductions, we are four undergraduate students at the University of Knoxville all enrolled in the same English class that gave us the project and goal of raising $1,000 for a local nonprofit. Us four, Julien, Bailey, Katelyn, and Katy, all chose our local non-profit, the <a href=""http://www.young-williams.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Young-Williams Animal Center</a>, out of a handful of others <i>because</i> we care too much about animals.</p>
<p>They're a huge part of our lives, with them being family who welcome us home with kisses upon kisses after a semester away here in Knoxville. And it's not just the four of us who have animals to welcome us home; it's <i>everyone </i>who has ever had a pet. The man who works is welcomed home by his golden retriever, by being tackled by the weight of his dog, and the woman who works is greeted by the excited ""meows"" of a kitty cat who missed her dearly. With that we all found in the YWAC, is that they give you those animals who will love you unconditionally for the rest of their lives, but they need the community's help. They need, mostly, a new x-ray machine, and obviously supplies such as food. No one benefits from animals more than people, and the four of us feel like we need to help them get what the YWAC, a temporary home, needs so they can find those forever homes.</p>
<p>The Young-William's Animal Center has a Vision and a Mission on their website which state:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vision: A healthy community through compassionate care of animals.</li>
<li>Mission: To serve the community though innovative approaches to sheltering, adopting, the spaying/neutering of animals and public education about animal welfare.</li>
</ul>
<p>The four of us, just undergraduate students at UTK, want to help the Young-Williams Animal Center achieve their vision and mission, and we plan to this semester and hopefully afterwards into the later years of our college lives. And for that to happen, we need you, the most important part of our efforts.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The breakdown you need to know:</p>
<p>Our total is $1,000 for a <strong><a href=""https://youtu.be/suivXDfVSlo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">new x-ray machine</a></strong> that the YWAC needs for the animals that are under their care before finding new homes by the loving families and people in the Knoxville area, and while those cost more than just $1,000, every little bit counts for them to properly take care of those lovable animals.</p>
<p>Perks! Who doesn't love stuff? And more importantly, who doesn't love animal themed stuff?! We have come up with some small mentions or gifts for donations that YOU contribute! See those below!</p>

<h3>The Impact That YOU'RE Making</h3>
<p>You might live in Tennessee, you might not, but sharing, donating, speaking about it, <i>seeing this page and what it means</i>, is more help than most anyone would make for most things. Almost everyone has interacted with animals in some way, and sometimes it's negative, but a lot of times there's a bond made, a <i>positive </i>bond that is something you'll never feel with a person. Animals give you unconditional love; they love with all they have because <strong>you're</strong> all they do have. Helping   animals helps people because those animals they get will be healthy and happy and ready for belly scratches during the day and snores at night that are right in your ear.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>All this money does go to the Young-William's Animal Center for their x-ray machine, no matter how much is raised. For them, they have to raise a total of $23,000 dollars, and we're only contributing to $1,000 of that. However, they have reached roughly to $10,000, which is wonderful. It's a challenge for us to help the successfully, and it's a challenge for you to decide to help them or not.</p>
<p>But we went to Mardi Growl, which is an event the YWAC has put on for the last ten years, and we wrote about it in the first part of our most recent blog post <strong><u><a href=""https://pawsitivityweb.wordpress.com/blog/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>,</u></strong> and from our experience with them, they fully believe in their cause to help the animals in their care, educate their community in which they reside, and help with innovations when it comes to sheltering.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>While you may not be able to donate yourself, others might. Share the page on social media, talk about it to friends and families and pull the page up on your phone even. </p>
<p>And if it's not us, help other shelters and centers around your area. There are more than just the YWAC that need your help.</p>
<p> All of us here who are ""Pawsitivity"", Julien, Bailey, Katelyn, and Katy, would love to thank each and every one of you for taking the time to read this and consider your effort into our cause here in Knoxville!</p>

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Your room in the capital of Portugal</span><br/>
</h3>
<p>Many years ago we fell in love with Lisbon. Its architecture, light, beach, people, food: each and all exquisite. After months of house-visits and endless talks with banks today we have bought an 18th century apartment that we would like to share with you.</p>
<p>A renowned 19th century Portuguese actor lived on our street with his name: Rua de Augusto Rosa. On that street there is a pink house where a lady was living for 70 years. Walking through that door was like travelling back in time. Original tiles (the famous azulejos), wooden floors and doors, a bath on feet, and furniture from the start of century till the seventies. This incredible Pombaline apartment has kept the original structure. And we were able to buy it with ALL the furniture!</p>
<p>Now YOU can help restoring this beauty in the heart of old Lisbon, Alfama. We will dig in history and make sure that the best comes out for you to enjoy afterwards. The 120m2 terrace will help in making you feel comfortable.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Pictures</h3>
<p>We have booked another trip to pick up the keys on September 21. Till then we can only show you the pictures we took at our visits when wanting to buy the apartment. Better ones will follow later.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>We need you for the renovation : electricity, add a toilet, paint, new windows, appliances and nurture the wooden floor. This will all be ready for 2017 !</p>
<p>It will cost 40000€ of which we still need 10000€. We will make sure to get the best local craftsman,  buy from local dealers in the city, and work in the most ecological and sustainable way possible.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>You will get a fabulous stay in an incredible city near the most beautiful cathedral (Sé) and viewpoint (Miradouro Santa Luzia). A truly authentic, back-in-time experience where you will know what Lisboa people live like. We will make sure you get a famous ""Pasteis de Nata"" on top ! (delicious pastry)</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>You can make a difference to this city (and to our lives for that matter). Too many apartments are emptied or only façades are kept so the charm of the old Lisbon is often unnecessarily replaced with new. Now is your time to save a piece of history and stay in it !</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenges are over. Buying an apartment in a foreign country was quite an adventure. Banks, lawyers, agencies, ... We have been through giant steps to purchase the apartment. Of course the challenge remains to make it a true home yet with help of locals and Portuguese friends in Belgium, it is possible to go to the next step.</p>
<p>In Belgium we have been renting out properties for over 20 years and over time we restored over 10 apartments. From a manor house to an art deco gem to a seventies tower flat to an industrial loft: we investigate a lot to make sure the restoration respects the origins and values authenticity.</p>
<p>Even if we don't reach 10000€ we will restore a maximum and it will only take slightly more time to get to the full result.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You can't contribute financially ? Maybe there is other ways you can help ? We are open to exchanges ! </p>
<p>In any case : you can share this so that your friends are aware of a new home to be !</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>What started many years ago as simple and passing thought - ""Wouldn't it be fun to operate a coffee shop?"" - has taken shape as the opportunity presented itself to open a unique experience in the Dacula area.</p>
<p>TradeWind Coffee Co. is a new coffee house to serve Dacula and the surrounding community. We seek to provide a place for the community to gather for meet-ups with friends, business meetings, church groups or student activities.</p>
<p>No stranger to entrepreneurship, owner Christian Jolly has built a successful video production company over the past 13 years and now seeks to leverage that business experience by building Dacula's first complete-service coffee house.</p>
<p>Some of the featured services and amenities will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Beverages </strong>- Selection of coffees, tea varieties and blended fruit and chilled frappe beverages.</li>
<li>
<strong>Variety of Brewing Methods - </strong>Espresso, pour over, drip, French press, siphon, cold brew, Aeropress <i>and more!</i>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Premium Coffee Beans</strong> - Varieties include single origin, organic, fair trade and select blends - all provided by our local roasters.</li>
<li>
<strong>Food </strong>- Breakfast, lunch &amp; dinner menus designed around high-quality ingredients and quick service options.</li>
<li>
<strong>Private Room</strong> - Available by the hour for small/medium groups or off-site business meetings.</li>
<li>
<strong>Children's Area</strong> - separate room for young children to play while parents enjoy the cafe</li>
<li>
<strong>Large Outdoor Patio</strong> - open-air accomodations for general dining and special outdoor events</li>
<li>
<strong>Educational Events</strong> - Learn innovative methods and techniques for at-home brewing.</li>
<li>
<strong>Live Music</strong> - Regional musicians performing regularly in-house</li>
<li>
<strong>Retail Merchandise</strong> - Whole bean coffees - including those brewed in our shop - will be available for purchase by-the-pound, along with a selection of brewing equipment and tools, loose leaf and bag tea varieties, take home food items and quality promotional merchandise (mugs, bottles, t-shirts and more).</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need (Funding!) &amp; What You Get (Perks!)</h3>
<p>While we are using our own resources and traditional funding methods to help build the shop, we still need <strong>your help</strong> to accomplish all our goals and pave a clear path for this endeavor. Why would you support us? A few possible reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>You live in/near the area and want to help bring a <strong>real </strong>coffee shop to life for your own enjoyment.</li>
<li>You really love supporting small businesses and are just happy to be part of it!</li>
<li>You think our perks are pretty cool and you love getting something awesome while supporting something awesome.</li>
<li><i><strong>ALL OF THE ABOVE!</strong></i></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Perks?</strong> <i>We got 'em!</i> Check out the different ways you can support our efforts while receiving something to tide you over until the shop is completely open to the public. All perk details are listed in the specific support levels.</p>
<p><strong>Interested in more than one perk?</strong> If you'd like to take advantage of multiple perks (either for yourself, or as gifts for others), you'll need to check out a separate time for each perk.</p>
<p><strong>Want to avoid shipping?</strong> Shipping is required on all physical goods orders except when a special event is included in the perk. However, if you want to wait and pick up your items, we can refund your shipping and you can get them when the shop opens.</p>
<p>*** Design previews are subject to change for physical perks ***</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As previously mentioned, this concept is something the area has not previously enjoyed. While there are a number of places to grab a quick cup of joe, there's never been anything as accommodating and extensive as the offering proposed by TradeWind Coffee Co.</p>
<p>In addition to the customer experience, the community will benefit from <strong>employment opportunities </strong>- full time and part time positions for experienced employees as well as high school and college students. Regionally, businesses will benefit from our sourcing of food and beverage ingredients from <strong>local suppliers</strong>, further enhancing the number of dollars retained in the area and aiding in the freshness of our prepared items. Lastly, the presence of a <strong>high-end coffee shop</strong> in the neighborhood adds value of living in this community, which becomes attractive for new families and helps maintain and boost property values for all residents.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Part of the reason we are seeking additional funding through Indiegogo is to hedge our cash flow over the start-up period, providing a better opportunity to compete in the market for many years. The byproduct is that we are also able to remain <strong>innovative and responsive </strong>to customer preferences by leveraging additional cash flow into new service areas.</p>
<p> </p>

What started many years ago as simple and passing thought - ""Wouldn't it be fun to operate a coffee shop?"" - has taken shape as the opportunity presented itself to open a unique experience in the Dacula area.
TradeWind Coffee Co. is a new coffee house to serve Dacula and the surrounding community. We seek to provide a place for the community to gather for meet-ups with friends, business meetings, church groups or student activities.
No stranger to entrepreneurship, owner Christian Jolly has built a successful video production company over the past 13 years and now seeks to leverage that business experience by building Dacula's first complete-service coffee house.
Some of the featured services and amenities will include:


Beverages - Selection of coffees, tea varieties and blended fruit and chilled frappe beverages.

Variety of Brewing Methods - Espresso, pour over, drip, French press, siphon, cold brew, Aeropress and more!


Premium Coffee Beans - Varieties include single origin, organic, fair trade and select blends - all provided by our local roasters.

Food - Breakfast, lunch & dinner menus designed around high-quality ingredients and quick service options.

Private Room - Available by the hour for small/medium groups or off-site business meetings.

Children's Area - separate room for young children to play while parents enjoy the cafe

Large Outdoor Patio - open-air accomodations for general dining and special outdoor events

Educational Events - Learn innovative methods and techniques for at-home brewing.

Live Music - Regional musicians performing regularly in-house

Retail Merchandise - Whole bean coffees - including those brewed in our shop - will be available for purchase by-the-pound, along with a selection of brewing equipment and tools, loose leaf and bag tea varieties, take home food items and quality promotional merchandise (mugs, bottles, t-shirts and more).

 

What We Need (Funding!) & What You Get (Perks!)
While we are using our own resources and traditional funding methods to help build the shop, we still need your help to accomplish all our goals and pave a clear path for this endeavor. Why would you support us? A few possible reasons:

You live in/near the area and want to help bring a real coffee shop to life for your own enjoyment.
You really love supporting small businesses and are just happy to be part of it!
You think our perks are pretty cool and you love getting something awesome while supporting something awesome.
ALL OF THE ABOVE!

Perks? We got 'em! Check out the different ways you can support our efforts while receiving something to tide you over until the shop is completely open to the public. All perk details are listed in the specific support levels.
Interested in more than one perk? If you'd like to take advantage of multiple perks (either for yourself, or as gifts for others), you'll need to check out a separate time for each perk.
Want to avoid shipping? Shipping is required on all physical goods orders except when a special event is included in the perk. However, if you want to wait and pick up your items, we can refund your shipping and you can get them when the shop opens.
*** Design previews are subject to change for physical perks ***

 
The Impact
As previously mentioned, this concept is something the area has not previously enjoyed. While there are a number of places to grab a quick cup of joe, there's never been anything as accommodating and extensive as the offering proposed by TradeWind Coffee Co.
In addition to the customer experience, the community will benefit from employment opportunities - full time and part time positions for experienced employees as well as high school and college students. Regionally, businesses will benefit from our sourcing of food and beverage ingredients from local suppliers, further enhancing the number of dollars retained in the area and aiding in the freshness of our prepared items. Lastly, the presence of a high-end coffee shop in the neighborhood adds value of living in this community, which becomes attractive for new families and helps maintain and boost property values for all residents.
 

Risks & Challenges
Part of the reason we are seeking additional funding through Indiegogo is to hedge our cash flow over the start-up period, providing a better opportunity to compete in the market for many years. The byproduct is that we are also able to remain innovative and responsive to customer preferences by leveraging additional cash flow into new service areas.

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>Hello, I am Jim Richards, founder and CEO of mediadogg Software LLC. Since from a young age, I have had an intense interest in science, electronics and video / audio media. This has led me to careers in computing and education, with travels to a number of countries, thereby appreciating a wide range of cultural variations in music, art, language and cuisine.</p>
<p>Solar energy has been my hobby focus for the past few years. I wanted to find more ways to participate in efficient solar use without breaking the bank. Most of us can’t afford the large expense of installing solar panels. So I thought about “small” and “portable” as themes for solar exploitation and even monetary savings.</p>
<p>I then experimented with circuits that would safely capture energy from batteries that were about to be discarded, and developed a battery selection methodology (Smartsort™). I also experimented with the use of portable folding solar panels and rechargeable batteries. By collaborating with Shenzhen Digiway Electronics CO., LTD in China, I have stocked the first perks for this campaign, and have begun to design the future products. I intend to use the funding from this campaign to finance this continued development, as well as replenish some of my initial investment.</p>
<p>If you decide to help me, you will get some fun, easy to use products, as perks, that allow you to tap the power of the sun, reduce the impact of discarded batteries on our landfills and actually SAVE MONEY by incrementally adding to your savings – much like with a piggy bank - that eventually will more than pay for your initial purchase of the perks.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>So far, we have spent nearly $4,500 in the design, development and production of a small inventory of eTopper™ products that we are using as Perks that are in-stock, and available now. So it is possible for you to get immediate value from your investment if that is your desire.</p>
<p>Of on the other hand, you are willing to place your trust in us, you may purchase the Perks that will not be available until sometime in 2017 – some perhaps as early as 1Q2017. These additional funds will be used to start immediately with the testing of prototypes and preparing for production of the 2017 Perks, as well as paying for some necessary business elements such as official UPC codes and insurance so that we can participate in wider markets. If sales are brisk enough, we are likely to also need to hire help for fulfillment and shipping.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>We have worked hard to develop products that are both effective and inexpensive. This means that there is a better chance that your investments, in addition to being earth-friendly, can actually save you money in a reasonable amount of time, say 1- 2 years. This is exciting. Many of us want to make an impact, but cannot do so, due to the high cost of implementing a solution. A good example of this is “off-grid” solar installations, that can cost up to $20,000. So we have developed a low-cost, high impact strategy for people who want to be earth-friendly and save money at the same time!</p>
<p>The primary component of our strategy is using rechargeable batteries to replace disposable batteries in the wide array of electronics devices, toys and gadgets that most of own, is entirely within reach of most of use financially, because we implement the strategy bit by bit. Today’s rechargeable batteries are much more powerful, efficient and cost effective than they were just few years ago.</p>
<p>The second component of this strategy is coupling the capture of solar energy with the use of rechargeable batteries. Portable folding solar panels are very affordable, and have enough power to charge a set of rechargeable batteries in a few hours. The planned eTopper™ set of products augment compliments this strategy by providing various adapters and tools to make it easier to adapt various solar panel designs and battery charging platforms. Furthermore, we plan to make available powerful, easy to use USB power banks that are populated with replaceable batteries instead of permanently embedded Li-ion batteries.</p>
<p>A third, but important aspect of our strategy is providing an effective way of using all the energy available in disposable batteries. Most batteries are discard with significant energy remaining. Extracting this energy is tricky and can lead to battery overheating and leakage. We have created a design that solves this problem, and will be bringing a product to market in 2017.</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>As with any business endeavor, there are real risks that we will not achieve our goals. The competitive technological environment and the rapid changes in the costs and capabilities of specific technologies can dramatically change business assumptions. We will do everything humanly possible to meet our obligations under the terms of this campaign, but at the end of the day – we are only human, and thereby subject to many things beyond our control. We will do our best.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>If you cannot or choose not to fund us by selecting a Perk, there are other ways you can help. Please tell anyone you know: friends, family or business associates that might be interested in our work, about this campaign. Posting on social media would be very helpful.</p>
<p>Of course, if you have any suggestions or comments on anything you see here, please post them, and we will try our best to be respectful and responsive to your concerns.</p>
<p>Just for reading this far, we have created a special discount code for 15% off the Amazon.com prices for eTopper™ products. Just search for “eTopper,” select the product you want and go from there. There are several options. At checkout, you can apply the promotion code <strong>O9VC2AKU</strong> for 15% off. Note also that <strong>USA shipping is free</strong>, and <strong>holiday gift wrapping</strong> is available for a small extra charge. This discount cannot be applied in conjunction with other discounts or Perks. Thanks for your support.</p>

<h3>Why Town Square?</h3>
<p>Wikipedia* describes a town square as ""an open public space commonly found in the heart of a traditional town used for community gatherings.""</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492792192/cr9w1ar5cxrwsfobcydz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Our desire is to reach out to people and give them a  life-changing experience. When our customers become our friends and family, we've formed community.</p>
<p>The decision to create this eatery and brewery has come out of a creative desire to impact the community through the passions we can share with like-minded individuals. We want to build a sustainable place that can pour financial support back into the community through utilizing local suppliers and supporting local charities. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490203562/pzvklshssxunhoot8s7h.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Town Square will be a place that will offer an environment where the only distractions will be the new items on the menu and the chatter of fulfilling conversations. You will not find large televisions, loud music or noisy broadcasts. We are offering an opportunity to disconnect so that you can re-connect with some of the more important things in life; friends, family, the arts and the passing of time. </p>
<p>*<u><a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_square"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_square</a></u></p>
<h3><strong>Who are we?</strong></h3>
<p>Town Square consists of three young families that share a passion for local food, drink and building the communities we belong to. </p>
<p><u><i>Brandon and Megan Boutin</i></u></p>
<p>Brandon is the driving force and visionary behind Town Square. His excitement and passion for community and craft beer is what drove Town Square from dream to reality.

<p><strong>Why Indiegogo and not the other guys?</strong></p>
<p>This was a simple decision. Other crowdfunding platforms offer only an all-or-nothing option, which is ideal for a startup that will require the goal to be met in order to get off the ground.  As mentioned above, Town Square is moving forward if we raise $1 or $1 million (Stretch...stretch...stretch goal!). What we are asking is: Will you join us in creating a community like no other?  And for your hard work in helping us, we want to reward you with some super cool perks!  </p>
<p>You will find our perks to the right of our blabber, but we want to highlight some unique ones that we feel are the best:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Our Community Gallery Wall </strong>- We want you!  We want to showcase you, our amazing community of supporters.  But we don't want just any photo.  Requirements consist of: Grade school  photos (awesome haircut and all), your awkward family photos (70's,80's,90's - they're all good!), Cute pet photos, and silly face selfies!</li>
<li>
<strong>Become a canning member</strong> - We are planning to can limited batches of our beer on a quarterly bases. You will be among the first to get your hands on these. </li>
<li>
<strong>Community Member</strong> - Get an exclusive invite to come and join us once a month to taste our new beers prior to being released to the community.</li>
<li>
<strong>You Brew</strong> - Work with the brew master to make a seasonal brew that you will be able to share with up to 10 friends at your own VIP private party. Not forgetting, of course, to boast about your own blood, sweat, and tears that went into it.</li>
<li>
<strong>Shave the Beard </strong>- This is Brandon's mom's favorite. You get the honours in taking a razor to Brandon's beard. If that is not enough, you get a canning &amp; private membership with the VIP package + ceramic growler. Oh, wait, and we will also be donating half of this perk to the charity of your choice.</li>

</div></div>","Why Town Square?
Wikipedia* describes a town square as ""an open public space commonly found in the heart of a traditional town used for community gatherings.""

Our desire is to reach out to people and give them a  life-changing experience. When our customers become our friends and family, we've formed community.
The decision to create this eatery and brewery has come out of a creative desire to impact the community through the passions we can share with like-minded individuals. We want to build a sustainable place that can pour financial support back into the community through utilizing local suppliers and supporting local charities. 

Town Square will be a place that will offer an environment where the only distractions will be the new items on the menu and the chatter of fulfilling conversations. You will not find large televisions, loud music or noisy broadcasts. We are offering an opportunity to disconnect so that you can re-connect with some of the more important things in life; friends, family, the arts and the passing of time. 
*https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_square
Who are we?
Town Square consists of three young families that share a passion for local food, drink and building the communities we belong to. 
Brandon and Megan Boutin
Brandon is the driving force and visionary behind Town Square. His excitement and passion for community and craft beer is what drove Town Square from dream to reality. Megan is Brandon's endless support and, when necessary, voice of reason. They have two beautiful young girls that help keep them both focused on creating an environment that a family can be part of.
  
Tyler and Katrina McNaughton                           
Tyler's design and tech experience has brought Town Square to life through floor space and web designs. Katrina's fun, magnetic personality keeps us all going and smiling. Tyler and Katrina have one sweet young son with another expected (Boy or Girl?) to join us around the same time as we open the doors of Town Square. 
Sterling and Mellissa Nordin                               
Born and raised in a small town south-east of Edmonton, Sterling and Mellissa have a deep understanding of what can be accomplished through community. High School sweethearts, they now have three awesome kids who keep them busy!
You
It is you that will make Town Square what we desire. We want to give you the opportunity to join us in creating this beautiful space. As contributors you will get some awesome perks and you will be able to say you helped in creating Town Square Brewing Co. - A place you can call your own.

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3><i>WHY DO WE WANT IT?:</i></h3> <p>A community space like our cafe would be the center of an amazing leather, kink and LGBTQ community. Portland has lost many spaces this year, and we want to offer a permanent location for our community to rally its resources. We want a home of our own to provide some of the following services:</p> <ul> <li>Safe space for meeting and negotiating with prospective partners where staff can assist in safety, vetting and even negotiation processes. </li> <li>Workshops every weekend on a variety of topics taught by instructors from all over the country, and hopefully, the world.</li> <li>Dining space to sustain a multitude of community munches.</li>
<li>Retail area to allow local vendors to feature their hand-crafted items and support them with sales.</li>
<li>Creative collaboration space to allow kink-friendly businesses to showcase their services while having a safe space to operate (i.e. massage, mental health services, artists, etc.).</li>
<li>Internships for job training, protocol training, service experience and education.</li>
<li>High Protocol Food Service events and training for servers. Assistance with Food Handlers Permit testing and job opportunities for LGBTQ and Leather community members. </li>
<li>Safe space to be kinky, eat, drink and be merry!! </li> </ul> </div> <br/><div> <h3><i>Risks &amp; Challenges</i></h3> <p> One of the biggest challenges we face with this project is the need to spread the word. We have found a fantastic space that we will be able to open our doors without ANY limitations about who we are and what we do, but we have limited time to raise the remaining money needed to secure the space before our time runs out on the opportunity. Our owner has been hosting Fetish Night events and workshops for two years to save the funds that have gotten us part of the way, so now, we reach out to share our plans with the community and ask for your support!</p>
<p>Portland's recent loss of kink-friendly spaces has brought to light the need to be completely legally licensed and insured in order to prevent the same from happening. The legal fees for appropriate licensing, insurance and building the space to code means the start of a TRULY safe space. With a solid business plan and the goal to start the business without the limitations of bank loans and credit card debt, the cafe is without our reach. </p>
<p>We have legal support. We have construction support. Now our investors, want to see the support and help of our communities! </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>What if there were a place where you could go to <i>completely</i> <strong>disconnect</strong> from the hustle and bustle of your everyday? A place where the constant stimuli from the outside world would just float away and you could <i>truly </i><strong>unwind</strong>?  </p>
<p>Well there is, just not in the triangle...<u>yet</u>.  </p>
<p>Float tanks have been around since the 50's and are now widely used thorough the world by people from all different backgrounds.  From pro and college athletes, high stress business people, to mindful yogis &amp; creative artists, <b>there isn't a single person </b>that wouldn't benefit something from floating.</p>
<p>Benefits include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduction in anxiety &amp; stress</li>
<li>Enhanced creativity &amp; focus</li>
<li>Improved skin</li>
<li>Chronic pain relief &amp; reduction in swelling</li>
<li>Intense Relaxation</li>
<li>Relieve old injuries (especially back aches etc.)</li>
<li>Ease Arthritis</li>
<li>Release Endorphins – the body’s natural pain killer and happy pill</li>
<li>Improve the condition of the skin</li>
<li>Detoxify the system</li>
<li>Useful in pregnancy (for the full 9 months)</li>
<li>Increase circulation and energy levels</li>
<li>Balance the left &amp; right brain</li>
<li>An aid for addictions, phobias and depression</li>
<li>Regulate sleeping patterns – simulates 6-8 hours of sleep</li>
<li>The list goes on and on...</li>
</ul>
<div>Opening this studio is important to me because I've experienced first hand how AMAZING the experience can be.  I've had residual pain from broken bones, lower back injuries that eventually turned in to sciatica, and general aches from just living life to the fullest.  Relief was never as great as it was while in and after getting out of a float tank.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>There are endless other people who have used floating as therapy to help relive headaches, ailments from fibromyalgia,  eating disorders, general anxiety, and so many more. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Ultimately, having a flotation therapy studio alongside all the other wellness modalities, will help make our community a more mindful, focused, thoughtful, stress free place to work, live, and play!  Who wouldn't want that!?   By donating to this campaign, you can help contribute to making our area a more awesome place to be! </div>
<div> </div>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In this initial push, we're hoping to raise $17,000.  By achieving this goal, we'll be able to secure more funding from other investors and bank loans, and opening costs of the studio including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buildout</li>
<li>Equipment</li>
<li>Licences &amp; permits</li>
<li>Overhead costs</li>
<li>Employees</li>
<li>and more!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>As this is an initial push for funding it may not be enough to get the center completely up and running.  So, we're working with banks and potential private investors to help secure whatever we don't earn through this campaign.  Because there aren't other float centers currently in our area, banks are  a little more apprehensive in providing a loan, but with you all behind us, we'll be able to show the mass appeal and desire for a float center and a comprehensive business plan has been completed to help show the possibility of success to ease any unsure minds.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Buildout and bringing potential locations up to code can be challenging and expensive as well.   We've already reached out to the town and health departments to get the ball rolling and smooth out any potential kinks before they happen. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I know all this work it's worth it because <strong>our community is worth it</strong>.  I am SO excited to bring this to our area in top notch fashion.</div>

</p><p><b>Short
Summary</b></p>
<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>My name is Paul Kilgore, I am the owner and head brewer of
WAORGANY Brewing. WAORGANY Brewing pronounced (War-Gah-Knee) will be a small nano
brewery located in Northern New York, near Ft. Drum, home to the US Army’s 10<sup>th</sup>
Mountain Division.  We will be licensed as a New York State Farm Brewery, hand
crafting our ales 3 barrels at a time in on our all electric American made brew
house. The name WAORGANY comes from the abbreviations of the states; Washington, Oregon, Georgia and New York, representing where my family is from and just a few of the many places I have lived and brewed beer. I am a service disabled combat veteran who has spent over 21 years in
the Army, and I am a two time cancer survivor.  <br/></p>
<p>Currently WAORGANY Brewing is in the startup phase. I am a full time grad student and am 1 course away from graduating with my
MBA.  I graduated from the EBV Program at
Cornell University in 2014. Earlier this
year I competed in a National Business Plan Competition for Veterans. There were
close to 50 entries, and my BP for WAORGANY Brewing took 2<sup>nd</sup> place, helping validating my business plan for the brewery. </p>
<p>I started brewing beer in 1994, and have been expanding my knowledge and perfecting my techniques ever since. I am currently a Certified Beer Server and working on becoming a Certified Cicerone.  Many people have told me over the years that I should make beer for a living, but it wasn’t until 2013 when I was
diagnosed with prostate cancer that it really struck me...I should be doing
something that I love and am passionate about. 
That passion is brewing beer.  Two surgeries and 39 radiation treatments later, my health is back on track,
I am cancer free and now it is my goal to open my own local craft brewery. </p>
<p><b>What
We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>Overall WAORGANY Brewing needs close to $500K to open the
doors to our brewery.  Through this campaign
we hope to raise 5% of that, in the amount of $25K. I have already put in a substantial amount of
my own funds, including the money that I won in the business plan competition.
However, that is still not enough to get the brewery up and operational. That
is where I need your help. We have found a location, and working with local town
zoning for approval, but need some additional help for equipment and startup
costs. I am working with a local bank to secure the remaining funds needed, but
will still need money for closing costs and down payment. The funds raised
here will help offset the cost of our brewing equipment which is $75,000.  If we fail to meet our goal, we will still
move forward opening the brewery, it will just be at a slower pace. </p>
<p><b><u>Perk Levels Rewards  <br/></u></b></p>
<p>We will offer the following perks as a reward for helping us out. Anyone local to the area in Jefferson County NY or willing to travel to us to pick up your perks, can waive the shipping fees. As our campaign progresses, we will add additional perks or extend the numbers under each section to help give you more options for helping us!</p><p>We will have a local and out of the area perks for each level that will allow for anyone local to our area in Northern NY (13637) pick up the merchandise and not have to incur any shipping charges...but this is only if you are able and willing to come pick the items up, we can not deliver them (sorry), if you are unable to pick items up please select the away perks and we will gladdly ship them too you for our costs through the USPS, thanks.  <br/></p><p>1  $10  WAORGANY Brewing Sticker and a
Thank You on our web site<br/></p>
<p>2  $25  Perk
1, and WAORGANY Brewing Pint Glass</p>
<p>3 $75  Perk 2 &amp; WAORGANY Brewing

<p>4 $125  Perk 3, &amp; Limited Edition  WAORGANY Brewing Founders Fitted Hat</p>
<p>5 $250  Perk 4, &amp; WAORGANY Brewing

<p><b>The
Impact</b></p>
<p>Starting any business
is a daunting task, and a brewery is no exception. We need help funding
WAORGANY Brewing to help make my dream come true, which is to start and operate a local
brewery, serve those in our community, especially our veterans, and help create
jobs for the veteran community for years to come.<span>  As a combat veteran and cancer survivor I can
no longer wait for things to happen, I am taking my life into my own hands, and

Summary
Greetings,
My name is Paul Kilgore, I am the owner and head brewer of
WAORGANY Brewing. WAORGANY Brewing pronounced (War-Gah-Knee) will be a small nano
brewery located in Northern New York, near Ft. Drum, home to the US Army’s 10th
Mountain Division.  We will be licensed as a New York State Farm Brewery, hand
crafting our ales 3 barrels at a time in on our all electric American made brew
house. The name WAORGANY comes from the abbreviations of the states; Washington, Oregon, Georgia and New York, representing where my family is from and just a few of the many places I have lived and brewed beer. I am a service disabled combat veteran who has spent over 21 years in
the Army, and I am a two time cancer survivor.  
Currently WAORGANY Brewing is in the startup phase. I am a full time grad student and am 1 course away from graduating with my
MBA.  I graduated from the EBV Program at
Cornell University in 2014. Earlier this
year I competed in a National Business Plan Competition for Veterans. There were
close to 50 entries, and my BP for WAORGANY Brewing took 2nd place, helping validating my business plan for the brewery. 
I started brewing beer in 1994, and have been expanding my knowledge and perfecting my techniques ever since. I am currently a Certified Beer Server and working on becoming a Certified Cicerone.  Many people have told me over the years that I should make beer for a living, but it wasn’t until 2013 when I was
diagnosed with prostate cancer that it really struck me...I should be doing
something that I love and am passionate about. 
That passion is brewing beer.  Two surgeries and 39 radiation treatments later, my health is back on track,
I am cancer free and now it is my goal to open my own local craft brewery. 
What
We Need & What You Get
Overall WAORGANY Brewing needs close to $500K to open the
doors to our brewery.  Through this campaign
we hope to raise 5% of that, in the amount of $25K. I have already put in a substantial amount of
my own funds, including the money that I won in the business plan competition.
However, that is still not enough to get the brewery up and operational. That
is where I need your help. We have found a location, and working with local town
zoning for approval, but need some additional help for equipment and startup
costs. I am working with a local bank to secure the remaining funds needed, but
will still need money for closing costs and down payment. The funds raised
here will help offset the cost of our brewing equipment which is $75,000.  If we fail to meet our goal, we will still
move forward opening the brewery, it will just be at a slower pace. 
Perk Levels Rewards  
We will offer the following perks as a reward for helping us out. Anyone local to the area in Jefferson County NY or willing to travel to us to pick up your perks, can waive the shipping fees. As our campaign progresses, we will add additional perks or extend the numbers under each section to help give you more options for helping us!We will have a local and out of the area perks for each level that will allow for anyone local to our area in Northern NY (13637) pick up the merchandise and not have to incur any shipping charges...but this is only if you are able and willing to come pick the items up, we can not deliver them (sorry), if you are unable to pick items up please select the away perks and we will gladdly ship them too you for our costs through the USPS, thanks.  1  $10  WAORGANY Brewing Sticker and a

The
Impact
Starting any business
is a daunting task, and a brewery is no exception. We need help funding
WAORGANY Brewing to help make my dream come true, which is to start and operate a local
brewery, serve those in our community, especially our veterans, and help create
jobs for the veteran community for years to come.  As a combat veteran and cancer survivor I can
no longer wait for things to happen, I am taking my life into my own hands, and
need help getting the brewery operational. You will be part of that, helping my
dream come alive, and for that I will forever be grateful. 
Risks
& Challenges
Nothing is guaranteed. We still have a
long way to go. We need approval by the local town, our facility needs to be
inspected by our bank, and we need to begin renovations, and order equipment.
Then once this is all done, we can apply to the Federal Government, (TTB), for

Anything could derail these steps and time line. It will take an additional six

<p>Every bottle of Free Water will make a huge

Free Water today you can personally help change the way millions of people can

<p><b>#freewaterforlondon</b></p>
<p>It is a simple concept.  We plan to advertise on water bottles in
order to make them commercially viable and be able to give them away for free. Commuters
would use their free bottles to refill during the day, and in so doing they
will continue to advertise wherever they drink from their bottle – at work, in
the gym, in the park with their children, on their bicycle.  You get the idea.</p>

<div><p><b>Why We Need You</b></p></div>
<p>For Free Water in London to happen we are
looking for £20,000 seed money.  We would
use this towards renting an office and a warehouse.  As you are all aware London rental prices are
sky-high and to get up and running it is a bridge we have to cross.</p>
<p>As 100 percent of our profits are given
directly to WFA, we can't approach traditional investors. Therefore we have
come to Indiegogo to ask the public for a hand making this dream of Free Water
for Londoners a reality. If we can encourage a small percentage of Londoners to
donate £1 or £2 then we can bring Free Water to the Capital this year.</p>
<p>And if you want to see first-hand how change happens
in a West African community when a well is dug we would love to fly you to
Africa to be part of the digging team if you make a donation of £5,000.  An experience of a life time!</p>

its turn. It is for this reason that we have incorporated a bold new concept in
the world of craft beer. By using a self-pour tap system, wishing you could try
one of every beer on tap at your favorite taphouse is a thing of the past. By
being able to pour as much or as little as you want, you will be able to sample
as many of our 40 taps as you desire. If that IPA is too bitter for your taste,
good thing you just tried a few ounces finding that out. Not sure what a Lambic
is? Now you can face your beer fear and give it a shot. Since all our beer is
priced by the ounce, you can let your fear of commitment be your guide as you
take a tour of dozens of breweries of which you may have never even heard.</p>
<p>At the Promiscuous Pint we are all about supporting the local
brewers. With a focus on unique and rare offerings from local Colorado
breweries, we will have rotating taps of all your Rocky Mountain
favorites. </p>
<p>The Promiscuous Pint was founded by Angela McLeod and Michael
Austell based on our passion for fine craft beer. Angela retired from the
Marine Corps and relocated back to Colorado to focus on her family and her dream
of opening her own craft beer bar. Michael, a consummate business man with a
wealth of knowledge in varied fields, came to Colorado with the desire to
create something to call his own.  With a love of live music, sports,
games and of course, fine craft beers, the dream of The Promiscuous Pint began
to organically take form. </p>
<p>Our vision begins when you walk in, the concierge will give you
a bracelet with a RFID chip in it which activates each tap and keeps track of
your expenditures. They will then explain the how to operate the system and
where to find the different style glasses as you change beers. At this point
the journey is in your hands. </p>
<p>We will have all of your favorite bar games such as pool, foosball,
corn hole, and more. We also look forward to having a stage where local
musicians can share their passion with us, whether it is open mic night or a
featured act. TVs all around will show your favorite sporting events
(especially Gator football ;) and you can count on all the Pay-Per-View fights
being live at the Promiscuous Pint.</p>As for food, we will be rotating Denver's finest gourmet food trucks to keep the dining options as fresh as the drinking options.<div>

priced by the ounce, you can let your fear of commitment be your guide as you
take a tour of dozens of breweries of which you may have never even heard.
At the Promiscuous Pint we are all about supporting the local
brewers. With a focus on unique and rare offerings from local Colorado
breweries, we will have rotating taps of all your Rocky Mountain
favorites. 
The Promiscuous Pint was founded by Angela McLeod and Michael
Austell based on our passion for fine craft beer. Angela retired from the
Marine Corps and relocated back to Colorado to focus on her family and her dream
of opening her own craft beer bar. Michael, a consummate business man with a
wealth of knowledge in varied fields, came to Colorado with the desire to
create something to call his own.  With a love of live music, sports,
games and of course, fine craft beers, the dream of The Promiscuous Pint began
to organically take form. 
Our vision begins when you walk in, the concierge will give you
a bracelet with a RFID chip in it which activates each tap and keeps track of
your expenditures. They will then explain the how to operate the system and
where to find the different style glasses as you change beers. At this point
the journey is in your hands. 
We will have all of your favorite bar games such as pool, foosball,
corn hole, and more. We also look forward to having a stage where local
musicians can share their passion with us, whether it is open mic night or a
featured act. TVs all around will show your favorite sporting events
(especially Gator football ;) and you can count on all the Pay-Per-View fights
being live at the Promiscuous Pint.As for food, we will be rotating Denver's finest gourmet food trucks to keep the dining options as fresh as the drinking options.

Contributions
Though
our hard work, sacrifice, and dedication to the Promiscuous Pint we have saved
$100,000.  We are asking for an additional $20,000 to purchase the
software for the tap system.  
We
know you have worked just as hard for your money so we are not asking for a
free hand-out.  We are offering perks for your contributions, everything
from Promiscuous Pint swag to multiple levels of membership. Here's a little
clarification of the various perks.

Without your

software system to allow self-serve taps.  This self-serve tap system will
be a one-of-a-kind Denver taphouse. Your contributions will set us apart from
your average taphouse.  Giving you a place to enjoy friends, good local
craft beer, and freedom to pour your own.

<p><br/></p>(updates at the bottom)<h3>Hello Indiegogo!</h3> <p>My name is Kate Eastmead, and I live in Port Orange, Florida with my husband Tj. We both grew up here in the greater Daytona Beach area, and we've found that Daytona Beach has much more to offer then just the ocean. It has a welth of culture and tourism hiding just on the other side of the bridge, centralized around the Daytona International Speedway, and the Daytona Flea and Farmers Market, which was voted one of the top 5 markets in the whole country. </p>
<p>In 2013 Daytona Beach got its first Vegan restaurant, and ever since then the vegan (and vegitarian) population has been growing like crazy. The only problem is, the resources haven't. There is still only one vegan restaurant, though many big chains have added vegan options. And, we do have many ""health food"" stores, but they are extremely over priced and don't have many options. We know personally that there is a huge demand for vegan stores here, and we want to take advantage of that by being the first.</p>
<p>A year ago I started making my own personal care products, and getting very into baking, because finding cruelty free vegan products and vegan baked goods just wasn't at all easy in our area. I ended up honestly loving my products, and so did my husband and the rest of our family. One day he suggested we could sell them, and it just clicked. We now sell our products from our Etsy store, and to people in person just by word of mouth. It's gone pretty well so far, but now we can't get enough.</p>
<p><b>Our Current Products: </b>keep in mind, this is just what we can currently AFFORD to make. </p>
<p>Face Wash, Facial Toner, Facial Moisturizer For Oily Skin, Facial Moisturizer For Dry Skin, Sun Screen, Deodorant, Lip Balms, and combinations of those. </p>
<p><b>Products we Plan To Make: </b>this is just what we have thought up so far, the possibilities are endless!</p>
<p>Shampoos, Conditioners, Body Washes, Body Lotions, Body Scrubs, More Variations Of All Of The Products We Currently Make, Handmade Soy Candles, Handmade Recycled Jewelry (a percentage of the jewelry proceeds will go to an animal rights organization or charity to be later decided), Perfumes, Bath Oils, Bath Bombs, Bubble Baths, And Our Own Personal Art Designs To Be Printed On Shirts And Tote Bags, ect, To Advertise Veganism. </p>
<p>Food/Snacks: Granola Bars, Fudge, Cookies, Brownies, Trail Mixes, Dried Fruit.</p>
<p>Everything we have ever made, and everything we will ever make, has 100% Vegan ingredients and is NEVER tested on animals, it is also all personally handmade by me (and sometime my husband lol), and packaged in all recycled materials. (The current stock of plastic containers we have are not recycled, but all future plastic containers will be.) </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Want To Do &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Our big idea is to open up a permanent store in the Daytona Flea and Farmers Market, and have separate portable equipment to travel to the many other markets and events that go on in central Florida. The Daytona Flea and Farmers Market is open Friday Saturday and Sunday, and all week long over any holiday. And, the many other events that go on around here happen year round, a lot of which are themed for health and fitness, which veganism is a big part of. We don't feel that leasing a store space or office space would benefit as much as this plan would, because being mobile lets us reach out to more people. And, that's what our real mission is; to educate more people on veganism, and show them in person how easy and affordable it really is to be vegan.</p>
<p>We need: The money to begin our rent for the Flea and Farmers Market, the portable tables, chairs, and tent, to bring to events, money to stock up on more of our products and be able to make the products we haven't yet, a printer for making the designs we will put on shirts and bags, and equipment for candle making.</p>
<p>We will be furnishing our shop with all recycled (and up cycled) materials we will personally build, keeping the money we raise strictly for the business itself. We set our goal at $1,000, which is not a lot of money when you're talking about starting a whole business, but that's our point! We do things cheaply and mindfully, leaving the smallest footprint we can, and bringing the most affordable products to our customers. If we DO NOT make our goal, we will still use every penny in this same way! It will only take us longer to fulfill our plan. </p>
<p>PERKS: for every person who contributes no matter how big or small, they will get a handmade thank you card made of all recycled and up-cycled paper. </p>
<p>Every contributions $5+ will also get a Lip Balm</p>
<p>Every contribution $10+ will also get an Eastmeads Vegan Earth sticker</p>
<p>Every contribution $20+ will also get a Decal/Bumper Sticker stating that you contributed to Eastmeads Vegan Earth in Daytona Beach</p>
<p>Every contribution $50+ will get the handmade thank you card, a Lip Balm, 2 stickers, and 2 Decal/ Bumper stickers </p>
<p>Contribute $100 or more and get all that to begin with, Plus, 1 product of your choice free, once every month for a year! (Starting after our store opens).</p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Veganism is becoming more and more prominent all around the world. All the major cities in America have lots of vegan restaurants now, even Orlando has quite a few. Daytona Beach is the next one to go, and we want to be a part of it. We plan to have a lot of informational pakets, stickers, and other advertisements with us everywhere we go to spread the word. </p>
<p>Your contribution to our store, is more then just a great way to help the local economy. It's a great way to advocate for veganism and animal rights! It's just another way to do your part in helping to end animal agriculture and testing. </p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>We are aware that not everything always works out the way you plan. Where as we know veganism will always prevail, our store may not at first. If we do not raise enough money for our plan, we will continue saving and it will still happen sooner or later. But, if we do fulfill our plan now with your contributions, and it does not make a profit quickly enough, we will have to consider a business or personal loan to keep us afloat until we can turn a profit. Of course that is not idea, but this project means enough to us to do whatever it takes. It's not about our own gain, it's about the bigger picture, and a Vegan Earth.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Absolutely any contribution will help and be so greatly appreciated! If you cannot contribute in funds, but still want to help, PLEASE share our campaign on all your social media sites! Get the word out and help us make Daytona Beach the first stop in our new Vegan Earth!</p>
<p>Thank you so much for reading! We will keep everyone updated on all of our progress, and we hope to see you soon at our new store!</p>

<p>Updates: </p>
<p>For the last two weeks we've gone out to the Sugar Mill Market in Port Orange, and brought with us all of our online products, as well as some delicious vegan snacks and deserts we baked. They were just tweaked recipes we found online, and they are not a direct representation of what we would bake for our store, but they all tasted great, and it was a good way to see what people liked and didn't. We sold a lot of product, and snacks, and many people donated to our campaign while we were there.</p>
<p>We've also gone door to door once so far, in the Port Orange area subdivisions, giving out our baked goods and snacks for free, and asking for donations to anyone who could afford to.  Everyone we spoke to loved our idea, loved the food, and many people donated as well. We also had a lot of people tell us they have sisters/brothers or friends that are vegan, and that they would love a store like ours to open up in the area. </p>
<p>So as of today (March 6th 2016) we've made $150 in cash donations. And we've opened our own online store outside of Etsy, at the domain EastmeadsVeganEarth.com</p>

<span>About The Red Hen</span><br/>
</h3> <p>Do you remember your favorite story from childhood?  Mine was The Little Red Hen, as told by Florence White Williams.  It is a folk tale that tells the story of a hard working hen who finds a grain of wheat, grows it, and turns it into bread.  Throughout the tale she perseveres against the challenges and succeeds at what seemed like an impossible task.  </p>
<p>That story has stuck with me and remains relevant to me today, though my challenges are slightly different than those of a chicken trying to grow wheat and bake bread.  </p>
<p>My home town currently faces a challenge: there are no ""just"" book stores that appeal to the local readers and that carry a wide array of books.  I want to answer that challenge, and open a book store for the community-a place people can gather, a place to learn new things, a place for children to come to and create memories (most of my earliest memories revolve around books and stories).  </p>
<p>Here's where the Red Hen is asking for help:</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>I am asking for $5,000 to cover licensing fees and getting a website established, so I can start selling and generating business while I work on the ""bricks"" part of the clicks and bricks model.  </p>
<p>Once the initial goal is met, additional funds will be directed toward the costs and development of the ""bricks""-establishing a book store that people can visit to find books or conversation.</p>
<p><b>What's in it for you?</b></p>
<p>My everlasting gratitude-any amount will make a difference, just like a single grain of wheat grows into a head of wheat with many grains.  </p>
<p>Knowledge that your contribution will ultimately benefit a community-once the bricks are in place, classes in life skills will be made available to the community, reading incentives will be provided to encourage children to read, and the money spent at the store will be recirculated into the community.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Next Step</h3> <p>The next step from your contribution-a website is set up, and I start doing business and building up community awareness of the business.  From that point, a physical location is the next goal.  Once I have the funds, The Red Hen will move into a brick and mortar location, and I will be able to expand my inventory, start community classes in life skills, and provide a meeting place for early readers and avid book lovers to get together.  Ideally, this will happen this year.  Realistically, it may not, but this Red Hen likes to shoot for the ideal.</p>

</ul> </div> </div>","About The Red Hen
 Do you remember your favorite story from childhood?  Mine was The Little Red Hen, as told by Florence White Williams.  It is a folk tale that tells the story of a hard working hen who finds a grain of wheat, grows it, and turns it into bread.  Throughout the tale she perseveres against the challenges and succeeds at what seemed like an impossible task.  
That story has stuck with me and remains relevant to me today, though my challenges are slightly different than those of a chicken trying to grow wheat and bake bread.  
My home town currently faces a challenge: there are no ""just"" book stores that appeal to the local readers and that carry a wide array of books.  I want to answer that challenge, and open a book store for the community-a place people can gather, a place to learn new things, a place for children to come to and create memories (most of my earliest memories revolve around books and stories).  
Here's where the Red Hen is asking for help:   What We Need & What You Get I am asking for $5,000 to cover licensing fees and getting a website established, so I can start selling and generating business while I work on the ""bricks"" part of the clicks and bricks model.  
Once the initial goal is met, additional funds will be directed toward the costs and development of the ""bricks""-establishing a book store that people can visit to find books or conversation.
What's in it for you?
My everlasting gratitude-any amount will make a difference, just like a single grain of wheat grows into a head of wheat with many grains.  
Knowledge that your contribution will ultimately benefit a community-once the bricks are in place, classes in life skills will be made available to the community, reading incentives will be provided to encourage children to read, and the money spent at the store will be recirculated into the community.
    The Next Step The next step from your contribution-a website is set up, and I start doing business and building up community awareness of the business.  From that point, a physical location is the next goal.  Once I have the funds, The Red Hen will move into a brick and mortar location, and I will be able to expand my inventory, start community classes in life skills, and provide a meeting place for early readers and avid book lovers to get together.  Ideally, this will happen this year.  Realistically, it may not, but this Red Hen likes to shoot for the ideal.

Challenges and Risks
The immediate challenge facing The Red Hen right now is getting off the ground.  Once up and moving, the challenges keep coming, just as the Little Red Hen faced many challenges in her story.  And just as the Little Red Hen kept moving forward, so will the store, meeting each challenge as it comes, and addressing or avoiding risks that come up.

<p>Hello!</p><p>My name is Andrei Filatov. Im 24 years old and I live and work in Shanghai, China. First time I came here in 2010 to study Chinese language(Ni Hao!) in Fudan University and since then I can call Shanghai my home. I remember this crazy week I had when I just came here, NOBODY speaks English, everything is in Chinese(of course, you’re in China! Haha) and me standing outside the airport and thinking where to go and how to get there... After 5 years spent here I want to apply all the knowledge and experience I have to provide affordable and cozy place to stay for people who travel around or moving to Shanghai!</p>
<p><b>Shanghai</b> is a huge city which brings people from all around the world in one place.

Foodies can find great variety of cuisines here, from the diverse regions of China to newest techniques of molecular gastronomy. Students come to study in best universities around China! Shanghai can fit any persons needs and many of them already enjoy what it has to offer!</p>

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">The Impact</span><br/>
</h3>
<h3></h3>
<p>We live in a time in which cities are consuming the land that once provided natural healthy foods and a lifestyle to sustain us.  Haute Goat Farm is a magical alternative,  if for only a few hours, for those who are willing to venture 5 minutes north of Canada's busiest thoroughfare, the 401 - less than an hour from Toronto. We offer young and old alike an opportunity to stop, breathe fresh air, engage with our farm animals and experience nature in many different ways.  We don't take people back in history, but share a vision of the future through a traditional, thoughtful updated lens.  </p>
<p>  </p>
<p><b>BACKGROUND</b></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Shain and I, like so many people, dreamed of getting a piece of land in the country. Shain's idea was to have a 'country place' to retire to - My idea was to have the horses and goats I'd always longed for.  </span><span>We found our little piece of heaven on 25 acres in eastern Ontario.  And when we brought home our first Nigerian Dwarf goats, we fell madly in love.  These wee beasties don't just steal your heart - they run away with it forever...</span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458609691/y2sbzy8a0398pmj8gupf.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 500px;height: 387px;""/></p>I<span style=""background-color: initial;"">t wasn't too long before were looking for ways to share them with others.  </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">So, just about 2 years ago, we started a small company called HAUTE GOAT as a way to celebrate all things goat (ours in particular), and to get back in touch with our roots, the land, farm animals,  local food.</span><p></p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">We invited people to the farm and to learn more about where their food comes from, how it is grown, all about our adorable goats and most of all a chance to 'get back to basics' in a way that you never could in the city.  The tours have become so popular, we added a visit to Shain's Shiitake lodge to see how those mushrooms are grown.</span></p>

<p>When Shain asked Debbie, eight years ago, if she'd like to buy a farm in the country - after she picked herself up off the ground, she said 'yes' at the speed of light. Shain, a true urbanite, successful literary agent and theatre producer, must have lost his mind for just a moment she figured.  Debbie had a small, but successful television production company in Toronto but she'd always loved the country and animals. Three weeks later, they found themselves the owners of a magical 25 acre property in Campbellford, Ontario.  For two years, Shain and Debbie commuted between city and farm.  In 2009 when Shain decided to retire, Debbie leaped at the opportunity to bring home goats.  The impossibly cute Nigerian Dwarf Goats who don't just have the sweetest, richest milk of all the goat breeds, but steal your heart and run away with them.  Those first 4 goats, grew into a herd of 30 or more (depending on the season) and became the inspiration for the business that has become Haute Goat.</p>

HAUTE GOAT FARM is a place where visitors of all ages can really get back to basics - animals, nature, food in their natural environment. This is a place to feel truly alive, explore, discover and be inspired. Our goal is to build on what we've already established and create even more unique and engaging experiences for visitors to the farm.  Where getting back to basics is about to get even better!  We invite you to help us fund this ambitious growth and help us realize those dreams.



The Impact


We live in a time in which cities are consuming the land that once provided natural healthy foods and a lifestyle to sustain us.  Haute Goat Farm is a magical alternative,  if for only a few hours, for those who are willing to venture 5 minutes north of Canada's busiest thoroughfare, the 401 - less than an hour from Toronto. We offer young and old alike an opportunity to stop, breathe fresh air, engage with our farm animals and experience nature in many different ways.  We don't take people back in history, but share a vision of the future through a traditional, thoughtful updated lens.  
  
BACKGROUND
Shain and I, like so many people, dreamed of getting a piece of land in the country. Shain's idea was to have a 'country place' to retire to - My idea was to have the horses and goats I'd always longed for.  We found our little piece of heaven on 25 acres in eastern Ontario.  And when we brought home our first Nigerian Dwarf goats, we fell madly in love.  These wee beasties don't just steal your heart - they run away with it forever...
It wasn't too long before were looking for ways to share them with others.  So, just about 2 years ago, we started a small company called HAUTE GOAT as a way to celebrate all things goat (ours in particular), and to get back in touch with our roots, the land, farm animals,  local food.
 
We invited people to the farm and to learn more about where their food comes from, how it is grown, all about our adorable goats and most of all a chance to 'get back to basics' in a way that you never could in the city.  The tours have become so popular, we added a visit to Shain's Shiitake lodge to see how those mushrooms are grown.

And no tour is complete without meeting our Icelandic horses, Lukka, Fabeina and Rocky...
Clearly people (especially people from the city) crave getting in touch with farm animals, the country, fresh, local food and all the things that remind us of where we come from.  



GETTING BACK TO BASICS IS ABOUT TO GET EVEN BETTER
In the summer of 2015 we had the incredible luck to find and buy a 200 acre farm just one hour east of Toronto and we began to imagine the possibilities.

We decided to turn to crowdfunding to help grow the experience for our visitors to include even more.  
It's ambitious, a little grand, and it's all very exciting.  We hope you agree and join us in the next stage of this adventure.

What We Need & What You Get


Our goal is to raise $33,700 for some ambitious new initiatives.  These will build on the great things we've already established and make the experience for visitors even better.


* SECRET GARDEN AND LIVING WOODLAND - Cost - $10,700


To be designed by nature conceptualist, educator and professional garden designer Carolyn Lecker, visitors are invited to walk the paths and explore what is natural here and what has been more recently nurtured as a complimentary life industry of shiitake mushroom zones.


In the secret garden, visitors will come across tall educational ""totems""...   information trees between the other trees.  Conclude your walk with a living library of tree trunk tables and benches with weather protected books of information and detail about this marvellous ""forest population.""
* FARM KID ZONE - Cost $10,500
Led by Julie Tufts, the Farm Kids program is designed just for kids.  Letting them experience the farm animals up close and personal, giving them a chance to dig in the garden to plant and then harvest vegetables, this area just for them will be pint-size and kid-friendly.




* ALPACA MOUNTAIN - Cost - $12,500

We are adding Huacaya Alpacas to our family.  This opens up the world of fibre to Haute Goat and we're pretty excited about that.  Alpaca fibre is incredibly light, comfortable and is hypoallergenic because it has no lanolin.  And a bonus!  Alpaca poop (called 'beans') is (second to goat poop) some of the best garden fertilizer for vegetable gardens and can be used fresh from the pasture.   And if all of that weren't enough, they are the most gentle, sweet natured animals.

UNIQUE PERKS
We've put together a fun list of perks to choose from.  This is our way of thanking you for your sponsorship and giving something unique back.     
About Us   




Debbie Nightingale and Shain Jaffe

When Shain asked Debbie, eight years ago, if she'd like to buy a farm in the country - after she picked herself up off the ground, she said 'yes' at the speed of light. Shain, a true urbanite, successful literary agent and theatre producer, must have lost his mind for just a moment she figured.  Debbie had a small, but successful television production company in Toronto but she'd always loved the country and animals. Three weeks later, they found themselves the owners of a magical 25 acre property in Campbellford, Ontario.  For two years, Shain and Debbie commuted between city and farm.  In 2009 when Shain decided to retire, Debbie leaped at the opportunity to bring home goats.  The impossibly cute Nigerian Dwarf Goats who don't just have the sweetest, richest milk of all the goat breeds, but steal your heart and run away with them.  Those first 4 goats, grew into a herd of 30 or more (depending on the season) and became the inspiration for the business that has become Haute Goat.
Juliette Tufts

A teacher with more than 25 years of Primary and Special Education teaching, curriculum development and recreation experience. A graduate of Laurentian University, obtaining an honours degree in Physical Health/Education and a Bachelor of Education degree from Nipissing University. Juliette and her husband of 37 years moved to the Northumberland area, where they embarked on owning and running their own small cottage resort on Rice Lake. There three children are experiencing their careers in Australia, Europe and Peterborough. Juliette's love of animals, nature and the farm life has led her to Haute Goat. 
Carolyn Lecker

“A Living Woodland” is a creation of Carolyn Lecker, a nature conceptualist, educator and professional garden designer. Carolyn is the Director and designer of the award winning Black Walnut Educational Gardens, in Prince Edward County, where innumerable gardens; heritage; medicinal; exotic and notably the Fragrant Tactile Garden for the Visually Challenged are situated on a 17 acre site. The facility showcases gardens both for their beauty and inspiration but also as a tool in learning. There is an emphasis on intergenerational activity (seniors and at-risk youth). Visiting classes; school age and university come for programming and many others of many ages visit from around the world participating in tours, workshops, special programs and occasionally volunteer. 
As a designer, Carolyn is a specialist in raised bed gardening, sustainable landscape, rooftop horticulture and forest gardening. As a visiting lecturer, Carolyn has brought her focus of gentle permaculture and sustainability to three continents.

Most of my family still eat meat, this is about educating and enlightening EVERYONE to make their OWN choice! You may still love animals and support the vision for World Peace, but may just find that you don’t want to or cant stop eating meat. We are not intending to force anyone into anything. You are welcome to support too for $1, and take a look at why we are so PASSIONATE as Vegans. In this campaign I have structured it to break the BIG 1 Billion People Target down into smaller, more attainable targets. Meaning I will run 8 campaigns, consisting of a launch month (to spread the word) and a ACTION/fulfillment month, where we will do the 1 month Vegan 4 Good experience and support each other and others exploring being vegan for the first time.Each meal plan will be different from the last, Ill have new coaching videos and interviews with more experts too. This is intended to be a very dynamic, ever expanding campaign and I will be documenting everything in this process.When this gains more momentum more people will hear and know about it, and then decide to join us.It's also up to YOU to share it :-) - if we can exponentialize it to the power of 10 in each round we will be that much closer to the end target of 1 Billion people Vegan for a month.Of course if it is done sooner then that will be even MORE AWESOME!I must be honest, I am excited and scared all at the same time! I wonder what amazing possibilities this will open up for ALL of us!Here is a video of me explaining the strategy:**Timeline to Success Vegan 4 Good VideoAnd here is a simple idea of the timeline and targets I have set for us to reach:Simply choose your perk on the right hand side of the page, pledge your amount and BOOM! You will have taken the first step with us to an amazing adventure of being Vegan for 4 weeks. The rewards will be fulfilled from the last week of April, since we want you to prepare to start the 4 week program as a group collective on May 1st 2016.The target for this campaign (Round 1)  is 100 - 1000 people (or more), and you can share and encourage your friends and family to join too. When we reach or exceed the target, the next rounds target will be higher, so we could even have 1 billion people be Vegan for a month in our first round! What amazing things are possible?I ask that when you choose to do this with us for the 4 weeks, join the Facebook group, join us on the coaching calls, ask questions and for support. That is the whole reason I put this together, because the No.1 thing that holds us back is a weak support system. Support yourself and ask for support.We can DO THIS!Facebook Vegan 4 GoodYoutube Vegan 4 Good Ok… I have a confession to make… I’m a tree hugging fairy that believes in riding rainbows on unicorns. You got me!I love dancing with bunnies and butterflies in my spare time (which is most of the time). I laugh more than I frown and I think I might be addicted to raw chocolate.I’m more in LOVE with myself and my life now than ever. I feel as if I can just be myself and that’s ok. I believe that the number one thing that is contributing to ALL of this is the fact that I have become Vegan. My wish is that every human being on earth could feel how great this feels, which is why I started this Indigogo campaign.If I could choose to leave any legacy it would definitely be ‘The fairy who inspired one billion people to be Vegan for a month and sparked the initiation of world peace’. So if you feel like you would like to be a part of this amazing adventure, back this campaign.Also, since I love hugging trees, I firmly feel that there should be plenty more on the planet. So whatever profits get generated from this campaign I have full intention of buying lots of land and planting food forests with lots of cacao (chocolate) trees, and retreat center where you can come for a magical Vegan getaway too!",51.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What is KlikCup
</h3>

<ul><li>In this time of modern technology, it is strange that it doesn't exist a common website for bars where they can offer their service at one place and on global level. With KlikCup, bars will have the possibility to upload events and at

<ul><li>Today online accommodation booking service  is too
expensive for facility owners where they are literally being robbed. With most popular travel websites commission
can go to 30% of room price. Due to high rates, owners are
forced to add this commission to room price and in this way their rooms are more
expensive to their clients. At the same time, owners have lower profit from renting these rooms. Through KlikCup platform, facilities manage reservations directly with their costumers. Reservation offer to wide audience, with no
commission is a “dream come true” to every owner. </li></ul>

<h3><b>How KlikCup was created</b></h3>
<p>Idea for KlikCup came to me when I was visiting beautiful city of Bratislava in Slovakia. After a long walk exploring the city I wanted to take a brake and drink a coffee. Since it was my first visit to Bratislava, I didn't know the city and where to go, but I wanted to see more and I didn't had time to waste.<br/></p>
<p>I saw a small bar sign in city center and I decided to take a chance because the bar outside looked more like a warehouse than like a bar. When I entered, I was amazed. Beautiful interior with story behind it and the location in a historical building. <br/></p>
<p><span>I thought to myself that it is a shame that there is no way to share this story to others. Luckily this bar was in city center and I was wondering what is with others in side streets? <br/></span></p>
<p><span>In that moment i decided to create a tool that will give me reliable information in few seconds, verified description given by the facility management but also visitor comments </span>to make the best decision. <br/></p>
<p>I wanted to help others with the same problem but also those looking for a restaurant or a place to sleep. I wanted to help travelers but also facilities to promote them, to tell the real story. Let them communicate between themselves.  <br/></p>
<h3><b>KlikCup today<br/></b></h3>

</p>
<p>First KlikCup website has been developed to make market research and it is still active on domain <a href=""http://www.klikcup.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.klikcup.com</a>. We wanted to show the
idea to wide public and to gather opinions. Now when the project is completed, the old website is

</h3>New website

countries; France, Italy, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Direct
visits to facility owners would be done with 8 commercial agents. For verified
photos and taking the real story information, we need equipment to take photos of
facilities. To show right away how the website works, we need additional
equipment that shows the website functionality. Equipment for 8 commercial

KlikCup to the whole world.<br/></p>
<h3><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></h3>
<p>We have already done market research in several countries and questioned more than

<br/><p><i></i></p>
<p>A story for the hope, expectancy and a miracle...</p>
<p>When I was 23 years old, my husband was 30. We had a dream – to have a baby and every day for two years we dreamed of that time to come. I fancied how I carry a life in me until one morning my dream came true. There were two lines, two red lines! I was so happy... We were so happy.</p>
<p>I called my doctor and after a few days she officially announced my pregnancy. I was subjected to all the necessary tests – blood tests, genetic testing, screening, etc. Everything was alright.</p>
<p>During the 5th month, I started having contractions and was emergently accepted in a hospital for 5 days. After that, every day I listened to classical music, caressed my belly and talked to my baby, my little boy.</p>
<p>One day I felt an awful pang in my abdomen. I remember that I couldn’t sleep all night. On the next morning, I was accepted in the hospital once again. I couldn’t remember anything. Like it wasn’t happening to me.</p>
<p>I wondered if it was true or not. Yes, it was true.</p>
<p>I remember being in a wheelchair and how I waved to my husband, and... that pain, and that fear in my heart.</p>
<p>I heard the doctor say: ”Don’t worry about the child, don’t care about it. Fast! Faster, we have to save the mother”.</p>
<p>I prayed for myself and the baby to stay alive.And for nothing, nothing else.</p>
<p>40 hours in the operating room. I was intubated. In that hospital, there was no medical equipment to save my life. But the other hospitals refused to admit me (although I have insurance).</p>
<p><b>Scanner. Embolism.</b></p>
<p>Plasma, blood, more blood! And that voice which told me about what was happening with the baby, about the operations, about hysterectomy; about how the doctors cut me and what exactly they were doing to me. I thought “What the hell is that?”</p>
<p>I felt my body in the middle of a room, maybe a green room.</p>
<p><b>Coma. Coma. Coma.</b></p>
<p>It sounds so scary. Where were they moving me? I think there were 4 or 5 doctors, I heard different voices.</p>
<p>“Give me something! Faster! I can’t stop the blood. Everything is in blood. Push it. Hold her hand!” – said a doctor’s voice.</p>
<p>I was thinking ”My hand, oh no. I want my hand. Please, don’t cut my hand”.</p>
<p>My next memory is fear, fear, fear, but no pain. And that white light, so blinding.</p>
<p>Silence, peace, quiet.</p>
<p>I prayed again: “Oh my God, please, take me. I can’t fight anymore. I can’t. I don’t have enough strength”.</p>
<p>And that song “You Are Wonderful Tonight”. In my mind, I saw my husband singing it. And I heard a voice in my head saying: “Don’t worry. You must be strong. You have a child. You are a mother. Who will take care of your son? Aren’t you going to fight? Don’t you want to hear the word “mom”? You must fight because he is fighting for you”. I saw my baby, how small and premature it was. I hugged him. I loved him. And I knew I would be fighting for him.</p>
<p>I heard my husband’s voice and I felt his hand. But I couldn’t do anything. I couldn’t speak, I couldn’t move. I could only cry, cry in myself. I heard the heart monitor: beep, beep, beeeep....And that fear again. No, no... I was thinking: “I don’t want to die...” I heard a voice: ”Sorry, I have to change the bank”.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">My next clear memory is how one of the doctors said to me: “Take a breath and cough strength. You are my pride”.</span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>“Where is my hand? I can’t speak. I can’t ask anyone what has happened. I don’t even know that I’m a mother. Where is my baby?”</p>
<p>Next memory...</p>
<p>Maybe 25 doctors were bent over me and they were looking at me. “Can she hear us? Does she know something? Hey Monika, how are you? Tell us something, please”. But I really couldn’t.</p>
<p>“Who are these people? Why are they looking at me?”</p>
<p>Then in my mind appeared a red light with memories and dreams. I looked at my belly and I panicked because I knew that there wasn’t any baby inside. However, my baby wasn’t next to me. If I was seeing lights up till that moment, now they had died away. I was too scared to ask what had happened. The doctors told me that I had a baby, but we were in two different hospitals because of our physical conditions.</p>
<p>On the 20th day after birth, I managed to walk on my own and they took me to my little boy. I saw him for the first time. I was standing secretly in the hallway and waited there for hours. It was dark, heavy and I could barely see through those dirty windows in front of me....</p>
<p>A loud noise sounded through the hall. My heart was beating so hard that I couldn’t hear anything. Then, for a moment it stopped beating, there was nothing on my mind. The whole pain and the absolute happiness, which can exist in the world, now existed in my head together at the same time. There was an ocean of tears in my eyes, which I tried to hide. I was smiling as never before in my whole life. This changed my entire world. Suddenly, I realized that this pure human being is my little baby – my child, my new world! At that moment, I felt myself much stronger and ready for the “fight” because I knew that I had to be with my child in these tough times.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448015661/ds8ujgulkow2uza27wkl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>Although I could see him through a glass window for only 2 minutes, I went to the hospital every day. I prayed and waited for this moment when I could touch and hug him. And this moment actually came. After 45 days, I touched my new world and hugged my dreams for the very first time.</p>
<p>I’m proud of him and his strength. Believe me, these little children are the strongest human beings in the world. Therefore, when they annoy you in the future, don’t forget that they have extremely tenacious character and they are doing their battle at all costs.</p>
<p>I would like to thank my husband, who was with me during this tough period, my parents, who prayed for us, our friends, who gave us such huge support. I would like to extend my gratitude to the doctors, who saved my life, also to the doctor, who took care of my treasure and who continues doing it even now.</p>
<p>I share our story and I hope that it would give support to other mothers. Be strong and believe!</p>
<p>This is my story.</p>
<p>This is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HELLP_syndrome"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HELLP syndrome</a>. It can happen suddenly, unexpectedly, but can be prevented, if diagnosed in time.</p>
<p>Thus was born the idea to establish the ""Healthy mothers, healthy babies"" Foundation – from my personal history. We want to help women to be responsible for themselves and the health of their babies. To remind them how important regular reviews are! To urge them to be interested in changes in the body and comment them with their doctors. Building trust between the doctor and the patient and between the obstetrician and the patient. We focus on prevention and all the necessary tests for the good health of mother and baby.</p>
<p>Because the information gives us peace! </p>

We are introducing these Warm Hug knits on Indiegogo to raise funds for an awareness campaign and need your help to unlock the potential of this project.
By ordering your knits now, you'll receive them in time for the Winter season. 
The one and only BunnyThe one of a kind Teddy bearBoth knits are made of 100% cotton and are filled with silicone fluff. Their size is 32 centimeters.Giving tests to pregnant women helps:1. Declining the death rate caused by high blood pressure (preeclampsia)'2. Protein self-control at home, especially for pregnant who are far from hospitals;3. Raising awareness regarding the high blood pressure disorders during pregnancy.Preeclampsia sometimes develops without any symptoms. High blood pressure may develop slowly, but more commonly it has a sudden onset. Monitoring your blood pressure is an important part of prenatal care because the first sign of preeclampsia is commonly a rise in blood pressure. Blood pressure that is 140/90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or greater — documented on two occasions, at least four hours apart — is abnormal.Other signs and symptoms of preeclampsia may include:
Excess of protein in your urine (proteinuria) or additional signs of kidney problems
Severe headaches
Changes in vision, including temporary loss of vision, blurred vision or light sensitivity
Upper abdominal pain, usually under your ribs on the right side
Nausea or vomiting
Decreased urine output
Decreased levels of platelets in your blood (thrombocytopenia)
Impaired liver function
Shortness of breath, caused by fluid in your lungs
Sudden weight gain and swelling (edema) — particularly in your face and hands — often accompanies preeclampsia. But these things also occur in many normal pregnancies, so they're not considered reliable signs of preeclampsia.
Our goal: to provide 1000 test strips to pregnant woman in BulgariaThank you for reading our campaign. So if you want something different than a knit, but still hadmade and loveable, feel free to choose from the cards below, made by mothers  to support pregnant women!

I was thinking ”My hand, oh no. I want my hand. Please, don’t cut my hand”.
My next memory is fear, fear, fear, but no pain. And that white light, so blinding.
Silence, peace, quiet.
I prayed again: “Oh my God, please, take me. I can’t fight anymore. I can’t. I don’t have enough strength”.
And that song “You Are Wonderful Tonight”. In my mind, I saw my husband singing it. And I heard a voice in my head saying: “Don’t worry. You must be strong. You have a child. You are a mother. Who will take care of your son? Aren’t you going to fight? Don’t you want to hear the word “mom”? You must fight because he is fighting for you”. I saw my baby, how small and premature it was. I hugged him. I loved him. And I knew I would be fighting for him.
I heard my husband’s voice and I felt his hand. But I couldn’t do anything. I couldn’t speak, I couldn’t move. I could only cry, cry in myself. I heard the heart monitor: beep, beep, beeeep....And that fear again. No, no... I was thinking: “I don’t want to die...” I heard a voice: ”Sorry, I have to change the bank”.
My next clear memory is how one of the doctors said to me: “Take a breath and cough strength. You are my pride”.

“Where is my hand? I can’t speak. I can’t ask anyone what has happened. I don’t even know that I’m a mother. Where is my baby?”
Next memory...
Maybe 25 doctors were bent over me and they were looking at me. “Can she hear us? Does she know something? Hey Monika, how are you? Tell us something, please”. But I really couldn’t.
“Who are these people? Why are they looking at me?”
Then in my mind appeared a red light with memories and dreams. I looked at my belly and I panicked because I knew that there wasn’t any baby inside. However, my baby wasn’t next to me. If I was seeing lights up till that moment, now they had died away. I was too scared to ask what had happened. The doctors told me that I had a baby, but we were in two different hospitals because of our physical conditions.
On the 20th day after birth, I managed to walk on my own and they took me to my little boy. I saw him for the first time. I was standing secretly in the hallway and waited there for hours. It was dark, heavy and I could barely see through those dirty windows in front of me....
A loud noise sounded through the hall. My heart was beating so hard that I couldn’t hear anything. Then, for a moment it stopped beating, there was nothing on my mind. The whole pain and the absolute happiness, which can exist in the world, now existed in my head together at the same time. There was an ocean of tears in my eyes, which I tried to hide. I was smiling as never before in my whole life. This changed my entire world. Suddenly, I realized that this pure human being is my little baby – my child, my new world! At that moment, I felt myself much stronger and ready for the “fight” because I knew that I had to be with my child in these tough times.

Although I could see him through a glass window for only 2 minutes, I went to the hospital every day. I prayed and waited for this moment when I could touch and hug him. And this moment actually came. After 45 days, I touched my new world and hugged my dreams for the very first time.
I’m proud of him and his strength. Believe me, these little children are the strongest human beings in the world. Therefore, when they annoy you in the future, don’t forget that they have extremely tenacious character and they are doing their battle at all costs.
I would like to thank my husband, who was with me during this tough period, my parents, who prayed for us, our friends, who gave us such huge support. I would like to extend my gratitude to the doctors, who saved my life, also to the doctor, who took care of my treasure and who continues doing it even now.
I share our story and I hope that it would give support to other mothers. Be strong and believe!
This is my story.
This is the HELLP syndrome. It can happen suddenly, unexpectedly, but can be prevented, if diagnosed in time.
Thus was born the idea to establish the ""Healthy mothers, healthy babies"" Foundation – from my personal history. We want to help women to be responsible for themselves and the health of their babies. To remind them how important regular reviews are! To urge them to be interested in changes in the body and comment them with their doctors. Building trust between the doctor and the patient and between the obstetrician and the patient. We focus on prevention and all the necessary tests for the good health of mother and baby.
Because the information gives us peace!

Currently our handmade knits and cards are available exclusively on Indiegogo.
1. What are the knits and hats made of? First of all, they are made of pure LOVE. Used materials for knits are: 100% cotton and filled with silicone fluff.
For hats: 25% wool and 75% premium acrylic.


2. Are the knits and hats machine washable? We recommend you to hand wash your knit/hat and lay it flat to dry to help preserve the knit's shape and details.
3. What is the appropriate age for these knits and hats? Our knits are designed  for 3y.o. and up. Our hats are suitable for children from 1y.o. to 7 y.o.
4. Can my child choke on the knit? We do recommend that young children always be supervised when playing with all toys.
5. What if my child doesn’t like the knit/hat? If your child doesn’t love his or her knit, please give it away to another kid. We thank you for that kind effort of yours!
6. Where do you ship? We ship worldwide! Enjoy free shipping to Bulgaria. For orders to international destinations, we offer a subsidized shipping rate of $20 USD. 
7. Can I buy a knit as a gift?  Yes, they make wonderful gifts! Thank you for choosing us!


8. How can I help support your Foundation? You can support us by spreading the word! Sharing our given story and posting photos of our knits on social media will help us reach more people and ultimately help more pregnant women get informed!
9. Is this a charity? Yes, we are a non-profit organization. Our mission is to help women to be responsible for themselves and the health of their babies. To remind them how important regular reviews are! To urge them to be interested in changes in the body and comment them with their doctors. Building trust between the doctor and the patient and between the obstetrician and the patient. We focus on prevention and all the necessary tests for the good health of mother and baby. 


10. How do you give the 10 test strips? We provide tests by simply buying and giving them away.
""Healthy mothers, healthy babies"" charity foundation is registered and operates according to Bulgarian laws.


11. What exactly is the test? Regular self-monitoring of blood pressure and self-testing for proteinuria could improve detection of pre-eclampsia in the higher risk pregnant population, as well as reducing the time, cost, stress and inconvenience of frequent appointments without compromising the ability to detect and monitor a potentially serious disease.
12. If you’re a Bulgarian company, why don’t you work with Bulgarian Giving Partners? We are a proudly Bulgarian organization and  we love to work with Bulgarian Giving Partners as we grow. Each informational campaign requires large financial and resource commitment, so as we grow, we look forward to work with and increasing the number of countries in which we give.

<h3><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The House of The Wounded Healer</span></h3>
<p><strong>The House of the Wounded Healer</strong> is the inspired vision of Noemí Ko-jí Santana and Francisco ""Paco"" Genko-ji Lugoviña to build a space for rest, reflection and refuge so they may continue their life-affirming work with renewed energy.</p>
<p>Paco is an ordained Buddhist priest and Noemí is a Dharma Holder of the Zen Peacemaker Order. With over 20 years of international missions committed to promoting anti-conflict programs and peace initiatives, Noemí and Paco deeply understand that the caregivers of the world need their own space in order to recharge and reconnect.</p>
<p>And so was born the idea of a space for self-healing for the healers of the world!</p>
<div> </div>
<div><h3>$50,000 to Build a Foundation for the Healers of the World!</h3></div>
</div><div>
<p>A few years ago, Noemí and Paco bought the historic site of Don Ricardo Alegría, known as the ""father of modern Puerto Rican archaeology"".  Villa Alegría is 7 acres of beautiful lush land in the sloping hills of Cayey, Puerto Rico.  </p>
<p>They decided to rehabilitate the large historic home and transform the land into a retreat center as a place of refuge for caregivers and peacemakers to honor his legacy and preserve the beauty of the mountain area called Jájome (pronounced Há Ho Meh).  </p>
<p>The plan includes using the main house to be used for guest rooms, meditation hall, dining room, kitchen, and garden.  Long-term plans will include bungalows, a chapel and two long houses for conferences and group meetings.</p>
<p>The main house, also known as a ""quinta"" (pronounced kin-tah) is almost 100 years old and needs major rehabilitation and modernization in order to complete the transformation into a holistic center for wounded healers.</p>
<p><b>$50,000 will help pay for the costs of rebuilding the foundation of the main house. </b></p>

<h3><u>Passing of the Torch</u></h3>
<p>Hi, I am Alyce Ray, a native of Opelousas, lover of fashion, art and culture, and aspiring business owner. I have been offered the amazing opportunity to acquire Pistache, a treasured local shop in the heart of historic Grand Coteau, Louisiana. </p>
<p>Over the past few years, I have developed a close relationship with the current shop-owner, Nancy Brewer, helping her around the shop on a seasonal, as-need basis. I feel extremely grateful to have been under her tutelage as an aspiring entrepreneur and woman in business. Working so closely with Nancy has given me an understanding of the ins and outs of owning a small business and instilled in me the confidence of my own abilities in moving forward as the owner of Pistache.</p>
<p>Nancy won't be too far away as she will continue to bake her world-famous Gateau NaNa right next door at The Kitchen Shop!  Nancy and I can't wait to be shop neighbors and co-host fun events that mix shopping, music, art, and food in the courtyard. All of these ideas are so exciting, but I need a coup de main -a little boost- to off-set my start up expenses while leaping out on my own and realizing my dream!</p>

What I Need & What You Can Get
I need $15,500 for start-up costs. Specifically, I need will help with: 
-the down-payment-operating permits and deposits required-a business computer-new inventory for the holiday season, including lines from  local jewelers and artisans-new website for the shop!
Here's the Best Part: You receive your contribution back! That's right! 100% of funds contributed over $10 will be given back to you on a Pistache gift-certificate. I will even break the total down into multiple gift-certificates, upon request, making this the perfect opportunity to knock out your Christmas shopping!  

The Impact
Each small business of Grand Coteau uniquely contributes to the success of the community at-large. Pistache has been successful for the past 12 years, providing women with timeless, classic clothing styles for work, play and all of life's milestones. The charm of Pistache represents the essence of the community itself. It is my intention to continue this tradition by contributing to the commerce of historic Grand Coteau!Every SINGLE dollar counts! Your contribution, no matter how much, will help me successfully transition into entrepreneurship and become the owner of Pistache. Shop ownership changes hands on September 1st.

Other Ways You Can Help
You may not be able to contribute financially, but that doesn't mean you can't help!

Folks, you can help me simply by spreading the word! Make some noise about my campaign on your Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram accounts.

 Christmas will be here before you know it and those gift cards will come in handy to offset your expenses in December!

After all, EVERYONE knows that New Orleans is already the sexiest city around. But there’s one thing the Crescent City currently lacks – an inclusive, welcoming, sex-positive shop. That’s where we come in!</p><p>Dynamo is an independent, female-run romantic boutique, founded right here in New Orleans. We’ve been around since 2013 as an online store and pop-up shop. You may have seen us at LA46, The New Movement Theater, or at shows inside the Allways Lounge. We’ve been working hard to turn our little pop-up into a real brick and mortar. And we’ve just found our dream home, right on St Claude Avenue! Problem is, some renovations are required before we can officially open our doors.</p><p>Sexuality-related businesses are actually ineligible for SBA loans. Weird, right? So instead, we’re asking our amazing community to help us get over this last hump (heh!).

After all, we’ve been in business as a pop-up shop for three years! The business has grown organically as demand has increased, and we have never spent beyond our means. So we’re actually doing fine on inventory, furniture, and even our point of sale system! And our new location is a total dream – one third of an amazing 1800s-era building, right on the new St Claude streetcar line. We've checked with the city and our zoning is A-OK. We’ve even got a wonderful, supportive landlord! <strong>But it turns out that this dream location requires a final round of renovations to bring it up to code.</strong></p><p>In order to open, we will need to improve our unit’s fire safety and update it for accessibility.

In the words of the Progressive Pleasure Club, a coalition of amazing sexuality stores around the US and Canada, sex positive shops:</p><ul>
<li>Provide pleasure-based, shame-free education</li>
<li>Provide a sex-positive, hate-free space in our stores and online</li>
<li>Are inclusive of all genders and orientations</li>

It’s important. What it shouldn’t be is shameful. We welcome everyone, regardless of gender or orientation, and strive to provide a cheerful, comfortable, stress-free environment. Our store is lovely, clean, and well-lit: perfect for nervous first-timers, curious couples, and sexual olympians alike. We want to be the place you’re proud to be seen leaving with bags in hand!</p><h3><strong>High Quality</strong></h3><p>Dynamo carries ONLY high quality, body-safe products. Did you know that the sex toy industry is completely unregulated? That means manufacturers can create and sell adult toys with no oversight – and they often use harmful chemicals to cut costs. Ever have a vibrator break after one use? Ever seen a melted sex toy? That’s because it was made with cheap, unregulated materials – which not only decrease the lifespan of the toy, but can harm the most sensitive areas of our bodies as well. For example, chemicals called phthalates have been deemed so toxic that they are actually banned in children’s and specific dog toys. But you can still find them in some vibrators!</p><p>That’s why at Dynamo, we completely curate our inventory for quality and safety. We only carry toys made of 100% silicone, non-porous plastic, glass, and/or metal. Our lube, bath and body, and kink selections are carefully vetted as well. Your sexual health is paramount to us.</p><h3><strong>A Community Resource</strong></h3><p>We’re more than a retail shop. We’re a community center, a safe space, and an inclusive resource for honest, accurate information about sex. Many of us who grew up in the South never received sex education growing up – or if we did, it was severely lacking or tinged with misinformation. Dynamo provides a place for adults to ask questions and learn about sex in a welcoming environment. We bring in nationally-recognized educators to speak on topics from kink to safer sex to keeping monogamy fresh. We’ve presented to university students, festival organizers, and bachelorettes.

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Much like American Idol offered a chance for the people to support and select their idol instead of allowing the big corporate star makers to choose for them, In Lakesh Magazine wants to do the same.  We believe we should give the power back to the people and offer them a product filled with positivity, inspiration, compassion and good intentions and allow them to help mold the kind of magazine they wish to receive.</span></p>
<p>Our goal is to continue to offer In Lakesh Magazine in as many languages as we can in order to share our message of unity and compassion to all.   The magazine is currently available if both French and English and will be released in Portuguese in January 2017, and hopefully in many more languages in the years to come!</p>

The media and the world of advertising have always been an integral part of our lives.   Although they serve a great purpose, they can also shape our way of thinking in ways we may not be aware.   In Lakesh Magazine, would like to continue to provide an ad-free environment for its readers  and enable them to fully enjoy the written pieces without the distraction of promotional messages. 
In addition, we want to give the reader the opportunity to connect in an even more profound way to the stories via an audio option that is included in each monthly publication!    HOW AWESOME IS THAT!





In Lakesh Magazine's mission is to create greater and stronger unity of people from every corner of the world.  Our online publication truly has a beating heart!

The Impact

 In Lakesh Magazine wants to change the way we receive information, by offering the reader cover to cover content without any advertising. It also offers an AUDIO OPTION to listen to the article or story giving a more intimate experience to its audience.  We want to give every subscriber the opportunity to explore their own thoughts without any disruptions.  
Much like American Idol offered a chance for the people to support and select their idol instead of allowing the big corporate star makers to choose for them, In Lakesh Magazine wants to do the same.  We believe we should give the power back to the people and offer them a product filled with positivity, inspiration, compassion and good intentions and allow them to help mold the kind of magazine they wish to receive.
Our goal is to continue to offer In Lakesh Magazine in as many languages as we can in order to share our message of unity and compassion to all.   The magazine is currently available if both French and English and will be released in Portuguese in January 2017, and hopefully in many more languages in the years to come!

<div><div><div>
<p>Imagine the delight of a child enjoying a cotton candy pedicure while devouring a princess ice cream sundae uniquely prepared exactly to their liking. Then, take a moment to imagine moving on to a Fruit Loop manicure, topped off with a hair wrap doused in hot pink and orange, and to complete the ‘sweet’ experience -- some glitter make-up for the ultimate sparkle.</p>
<p>Immersed in a heavenly Candyland atmosphere, with cupcakes on the walls and cherries hanging from above, ‘Sundae Spa’ is a magical fantasy of kids everywhere.  A fairy tale brought to life, Sundae Spa is the business that ‘love’ built.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476744957/uhsw26pzj0uty66exsdg.png"" src="""" style=""width: 54px;height: 58px;""/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;"">Inspiration</span></p>
<p>Sundae Spa is the brilliant concept of former science teacher Kimberly Swan whose inspiration evolved during a family vacation. After booking a spa experience for her kids that promised a lot of fun and sweet treats, the experience left them with nothing more than a sour taste.  During their 3-hour drive home, the Swan family’s creative juices started flowing and the idea for a ‘yummy’ spa experience was cooked up!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476744957/uhsw26pzj0uty66exsdg.png"" src="""" style=""width: 54px;height: 58px;""/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;"">Sundae Spa</span></p>
<p>Sundae Spa was first ‘made’ in Kim’s office, with a huge story board filled with ideas. Those ideas transformed her basement into a mini-lab, with her kids morphing into blue Smurfs and pink princesses and a lesson learned <i>NOT</i> to use food coloring, which is suggested online.</p>
<p>After years of research and countless experiments, Kim had developed a book of recipes that would create the sweetest of spa experiences for kids.</p>
<p>Combining her love of teaching with what her kids loved, Kim created a concept that included an interactive experience.  Kids not only pick their own colors and flavors, but they learn about the science behind the services offered, like how one’s hair turns blue!</p>
<p>Following a two-year search for capital, the first Sundae Spa opened its doors in 2010.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476744957/uhsw26pzj0uty66exsdg.png"" src="""" style=""width: 54px;height: 58px;""/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;"">Sundae Spa Mobile -- 'Wish' Upon a Sundae Star</span></p>
<p>Six years later, there are two Sundae Spa locations in Connecticut and now Kim’s ‘wish’ is to make dreams come true for those who are unable to come to one of the spas. To do that, kim wants to take Sundae Spa on the road and has launched this campaign to generate support for the ‘Wish’ Upon a Sundae Spa mobile.</p>
<p>Sundae Spa has partnered with one of the most recognizable national charities/organizations that grants 'wishes' to children with life-threatening illnesses.</p>
<p>The initial plans are to launch the ‘Wish’ Upon a Sundae Spa mobile in four locations:</p>
<p>- Hartford, CT</p>
<p>- Boston, MA</p>
<p>- Philadelphia, PA</p>
<p>- New York, NY</p>
<p>With your help, ‘Wish’ Upon a Sundae Spa mobile will travel to each city and host 12-15 of the national children’s organization Sundae Spa has partnered with to give those kids with life-threatening illnesses the most magical and incredible party ever.  These parties will be provided to the charity at NO CHARGE.</p>
<p>In addition, we will be auctioning off a party in each market with all proceeds being donated to the charity Sundae spa has partnered with.</p>
<p>The ‘Wish’ Upon a Sundae Spa mobile has created a special event package dedicated to this charity and a percentage of all parties will be directed back to the charity for more ‘wishes’ to be granted. </p>

<p>It has been a life-long dream to open my own business.  I was told by many that it would never happen.  I raised  7  girls, so no one knows better than me that anything is possible.  It took an extraordinary amount of time, dedication, sacrifice, do-overs and love, but at the end of the day I am a success and I couldn't be more grateful.</p>

Imagine the delight of a child enjoying a cotton candy pedicure while devouring a princess ice cream sundae uniquely prepared exactly to their liking. Then, take a moment to imagine moving on to a Fruit Loop manicure, topped off with a hair wrap doused in hot pink and orange, and to complete the ‘sweet’ experience -- some glitter make-up for the ultimate sparkle.
Immersed in a heavenly Candyland atmosphere, with cupcakes on the walls and cherries hanging from above, ‘Sundae Spa’ is a magical fantasy of kids everywhere.  A fairy tale brought to life, Sundae Spa is the business that ‘love’ built.
Inspiration
Sundae Spa is the brilliant concept of former science teacher Kimberly Swan whose inspiration evolved during a family vacation. After booking a spa experience for her kids that promised a lot of fun and sweet treats, the experience left them with nothing more than a sour taste.  During their 3-hour drive home, the Swan family’s creative juices started flowing and the idea for a ‘yummy’ spa experience was cooked up!
Sundae Spa
Sundae Spa was first ‘made’ in Kim’s office, with a huge story board filled with ideas. Those ideas transformed her basement into a mini-lab, with her kids morphing into blue Smurfs and pink princesses and a lesson learned NOT to use food coloring, which is suggested online.
After years of research and countless experiments, Kim had developed a book of recipes that would create the sweetest of spa experiences for kids.
Combining her love of teaching with what her kids loved, Kim created a concept that included an interactive experience.  Kids not only pick their own colors and flavors, but they learn about the science behind the services offered, like how one’s hair turns blue!
Following a two-year search for capital, the first Sundae Spa opened its doors in 2010.
Sundae Spa Mobile -- 'Wish' Upon a Sundae Star
Six years later, there are two Sundae Spa locations in Connecticut and now Kim’s ‘wish’ is to make dreams come true for those who are unable to come to one of the spas. To do that, kim wants to take Sundae Spa on the road and has launched this campaign to generate support for the ‘Wish’ Upon a Sundae Spa mobile.
Sundae Spa has partnered with one of the most recognizable national charities/organizations that grants 'wishes' to children with life-threatening illnesses.
The initial plans are to launch the ‘Wish’ Upon a Sundae Spa mobile in four locations:
- Hartford, CT
- Boston, MA
- Philadelphia, PA
- New York, NY
With your help, ‘Wish’ Upon a Sundae Spa mobile will travel to each city and host 12-15 of the national children’s organization Sundae Spa has partnered with to give those kids with life-threatening illnesses the most magical and incredible party ever.  These parties will be provided to the charity at NO CHARGE.
In addition, we will be auctioning off a party in each market with all proceeds being donated to the charity Sundae spa has partnered with.
The ‘Wish’ Upon a Sundae Spa mobile has created a special event package dedicated to this charity and a percentage of all parties will be directed back to the charity for more ‘wishes’ to be granted. 
For more information on the National charity, please visit our website:  www.sundaespa.com
What We Need & What You Get




The Perks
The perks are a small token of the generous contribution you will make to help us move forward.  Every perk includes a thank you. Some perks will include personalized cards and photos from the kids involved in our charity of choice.  Higher levels of giving will be rewarded not only with our heartfelt thanks, but additionally you will receive some of the party rewards that the kids will receive as part of their special day.  We want you to truly be involved with the experience you are bringing to those special kids.
 
The Campaign
The 'Wish"" Upon a Sundae Spa campaign is a 60-day campaign.  If the necessary funds are not raised in this initial round, we will continue to fundraise through Indiegogo and alternative methods. 
 
I am so personally invested in this effort and determined to do everything I can to make 'Wish' Upon a Sundae Spa a reality.  If for some reason we are unable to raise the funds needed within a year, the money we do raise will be directed to the National charity we have partnered with.  We will meet with them and explore the most suitable way for the money to benefit the children.
 
For the larger contributions, with rewards that include website, social media and advertising, we will give you the option of receiving a $10,000 refund or you can request that all the money be donated to the charity.
 


The Impact
It has been a life-long dream to open my own business.  I was told by many that it would never happen.  I raised  7  girls, so no one knows better than me that anything is possible.  It took an extraordinary amount of time, dedication, sacrifice, do-overs and love, but at the end of the day I am a success and I couldn't be more grateful.
From the very beginning, I have shared my good fortune with child-related charities including : The Sunshine Kids Foundation; Make-A-Wish Foundation of Connecticut; Yale New Haven Children's Hospital; Department of Children and Adoption Services as well as taking part in smaller child fundraising events. Each one of us has the ability to make an incredible difference in a child's life.  I know, personally, how making a difference in a child's life has impacted my own -- I kiss them good morning and good night every single day.  While it does take money to help make some wishes come true, the personal rewards are immeasurable.
I need your help to make this special project, 'Wish' Upon A Sundae Spa, a dream come true.  Please know, that I have done extensive research and planning with my charity of choice to ensure that this campaign will be successful and will truly make a difference.  The charity has committed to be an integral part of all the events we have planned to launch our 'Wish' Upon a Sundae Spa mobile.  In addition to running this online campaign, we will be hosting other events to bring awareness to our efforts.  Along the way, we promise to keep you updated about our progress and to make you feel like you are on this journey with us.  At all of our events, we will interview the kids and post spotlights on our webpage allowing everyone to get to know the kids and their stories.
You have my promise and commitment that your money will make the difference in a child's life. Again, for more on the National charity we have partnered with, please go to our website:  www.sundaespa.com.

At the present, Dó plants have become more and more noble due to its existence far in the primitive forests as well as a wide distribution with small species.Being under threat of extinction with severe living environment damages, Dó tree have been put into the Red book.In other words, this kind of handmade traditional paper, together with long lasting handicrafts villages like Yen Phong, Dong Cao, Dong Ho…, is in danger of extinction and a likelihood of forever disappearance.Dướng (mulberry) is gradually being replaced with Dó for traditional manual paper production, as a result of its toughness, persistence and wasp repellent. Through corporation with the skillful craftsmen, several unsound of material excavation have been found, well illustrating the fact that the purchasers in Bac Ninh have no idea of the plant origins; whereas the artisans from Hoa Binh randomly collect mulberries for their production. This, in a nutshell, not only has a great impact to the original forestry but also the quality of handmade products.Therefore, we have reached the solutions on growing forest alternatively with materials plant as a way to ensure the stable quality and manage the uncontrollable choppings.Zó, as a social enterprise with the mission of preserving the ancient technique of handmadepaper of Vietnam, we always follow a total handmade procedure of producing papers without harmful environmental effects. In this campaign, an association has been made with Vietherb and Dichung to bring up the status of herbs growing for enhancing local economic development, as well as coloring the green surroundings here.The projectThe expected location occupies a large amount of forestry land; furthermore, the residents here are also focusing on developing their traditional handmade products, enhancing the extension of cultivating paper mulberry as a way to preserve the traditional industries and keep these plants from oncoming extinction. We identified the area with the 3 ha in total for planting trees along existed nature forest. We plan to plant a total of 6,900 trees from different species (dướng tree, Abelmoschus manihot, Polyscias fruticose,ect ) -  6900 cultivars-  600 kg of compost-  Workforce (planting + fence construction + maintenance)

The 01 year old plants shall be multiplicated through making planting trays on top of the pad, building and taking care of the incubator.The paper mulberry, however, will be brought for cultivation in the forestry.
However, there’s a need for maintaining annual forest protection and recycling (at least within the first two years).

<h3>Let me Introduce you to my vision!</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>My name is Suzanne Lundquist and may I just start off by saying thanks for your interest in my campaign! I have always seen the beauty of art in the world and it really started coming out in my photography. I love the fine arts and would love to start reminding the world and future generations that there is still plenty of beauty in the world. I am a single mother of three beautiful children and trying to start my life over after my divorce forced me to close my business, after two years of great customers and clientele. I am not at a point where I am able to restart my photography business, with you help! Hopefully you see something worth funding here!</li>
<li>I am starting this campaign mainly to get the equipment I need to start my photography business again. Before forced to close my business a few years back, I always had great feedback and plenty of clients. And to this day, just using my smartphone I have still been able to move people with my images. Now I have been given this opportunity to work toward my dream of photography again and become a storyteller in the world of art again. With your help I will be able to reach out to others with my photographs and tell their stories to the world.</li>
<li>With your help you will be helping me by getting my name out there again and helping me establish myself as a photographer. You will also be helping those in my community with advertising of their own work and businesses; I intend to help them with some charity work, as well as my normal business. I want to help the world see all that is happening when we look in the right direction and eventually showcase my work.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What I need to make this happen.</h3>
<p>Here is a list of the equipment needs I would need to start-up again.</p>
<ul>
<li>Canon 5D Mark III</li>
<li>Two Lenses: Canon EF 70mm-200mm f 2.8 telephoto zoom lens &amp; Canon EF 100mm f2.8 Macro Lens</li>
<li>Canon Speedlite Flash 430 EX III RT External Flash</li>
<li>Memory Cards: 2 16 GB CF Cards and 1 32 GB CF Card</li>
<li>Canon lens hood</li>
<li>If enough is left over I would be looking at purchasing a more up to date Laptop also</li>
</ul>
<p>These would be the necessities for the startup process of the business to get it up an running. With your help you will be able to bring smiles to many old and new customers alike and help out surrounding communities and local businesses. </p>
<p>I will be taking fine art prints, family, wedding, equine, all sorts of engine types, and marketing and advertising for businesses. By helping me I am going to be reaching out to others to, ""pay it forward,"" by helping people who have started movements to help the world or individuals in need. The world is a beautiful place and there are so many individuals and groups trying to help out in their communities, whether it be helping: the homeless, veterans, children, or anyone else in need, I would like to give back to those who are trying to make the world a better place. I would like to help show the beauty in compassion and remind the communities around us that there is still plenty of good in the world.</p>
<p>I will do this not only for people in need but, also for my customers with the pictures I create because, its these little moments we catch, in all the hustle-and-bustle, that we can share with our family and future generations to come. Because, we all leave behind something and wouldn't we like to leave behind more than just a story? Wouldn't we we like too leave behind a legacy and a story line full of pictures to give someone the very real feeling that you were here, and at that very moment have them feel the same things you did?</p>
<p>If I do not reach my goal amount the money invested into here will still go towards the business and I will still try my hardest to make my way back into the creative edge again. I feel the passion for this dream is strong and will lead not only me but my family back into a sustainable future and keep the arts alive for my kids and their future stories.</p>

<h3><strong>1 idée et 3 hommes : 1 concept avec 3 directions.</strong></h3>
</div><p>La publicité représente un budget colossal pour nombre de petits producteurs, artisans, fabricants. Ce budget se traduit par un prix de vente plus élevé que le coût de production. Le consommateur en fait les frais et le producteur n'en tire aucun avantage si ce n'est d'arriver à mieux se faire connaître.</p><p><strong>Le concept s'articule dans 3 directions:</strong></p><p>1. Des consommateurs grâce à une plateforme de consommation collaborative et participative offrent à tous les producteurs, artisans, fabricants la possibilité de se faire connaître et de promouvoir leur savoir faire.</p><p>2. Cette plateforme permet aux acteurs de la production et des services de vendre leurs compétences et leurs produits sans frais de publicité. Ils peuvent ainsi garantir leurs meilleurs prix, ceux-ci n'ayant plus besoin d'inclure de frais publicitaires. Le consommateur paye pour savoir et se fait ensuite rembourser par un tarif préférentiel et garanti comme tel.</p><p>3. Cette plateforme est véhiculée par un magazine/catalogue virtuel qui présente tous les produits et services de ceux qui le veulent. Le magazine a un coût fixe qui est largement compensé grâce aux tarifs offerts avec le meilleur prix garanti. L'intégralité du produit de la vente de ce magazine est ensuite partagée entre les consommateurs et producteurs qui souhaitent promouvoir sa diffusion . Un tirage au sort de produits et services offerts par les annonceurs  (environ 200 produits et services) a lieu chaque mois.</p><p><strong>Tout ceci est donc né de la rencontre de 3 personnes:<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509707024/qlnuans0yqcbyyn6bnpi.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p><p>Des années d'expériences dans le commercial, le marketing et le coaching ont permis à <strong>Philippe RIAT</strong> d'asseoir ses convictions quant à ce projet.

1 idée et 3 hommes : 1 concept avec 3 directions.
La publicité représente un budget colossal pour nombre de petits producteurs, artisans, fabricants. Ce budget se traduit par un prix de vente plus élevé que le coût de production. Le consommateur en fait les frais et le producteur n'en tire aucun avantage si ce n'est d'arriver à mieux se faire connaître.Le concept s'articule dans 3 directions:1. Des consommateurs grâce à une plateforme de consommation collaborative et participative offrent à tous les producteurs, artisans, fabricants la possibilité de se faire connaître et de promouvoir leur savoir faire.2. Cette plateforme permet aux acteurs de la production et des services de vendre leurs compétences et leurs produits sans frais de publicité. Ils peuvent ainsi garantir leurs meilleurs prix, ceux-ci n'ayant plus besoin d'inclure de frais publicitaires. Le consommateur paye pour savoir et se fait ensuite rembourser par un tarif préférentiel et garanti comme tel.3. Cette plateforme est véhiculée par un magazine/catalogue virtuel qui présente tous les produits et services de ceux qui le veulent. Le magazine a un coût fixe qui est largement compensé grâce aux tarifs offerts avec le meilleur prix garanti. L'intégralité du produit de la vente de ce magazine est ensuite partagée entre les consommateurs et producteurs qui souhaitent promouvoir sa diffusion . Un tirage au sort de produits et services offerts par les annonceurs  (environ 200 produits et services) a lieu chaque mois.Tout ceci est donc né de la rencontre de 3 personnes:Des années d'expériences dans le commercial, le marketing et le coaching ont permis à Philippe RIAT d'asseoir ses convictions quant à ce projet. Comme il a beaucoup voyagé, il partage avec l'équipe une vision qui va bien au delà de nos frontières. Il est l'Activateur et le chef d'Orchestre de cette aventure extraordinaire qu'est en train de devenir le CACHE-CA$H-MAGAZINE. Lorsqu'on lui a remis la partition de l'oeuvre, il n'en a plus dormi. Il a travaillé à ce que tout concorde pour plaire aux auditeurs. Il a imaginé le concert en se mettant à la place de chacun.

<p><strong>Bonjour ! </strong></p>
<p><strong>Mon nom est Renaud Paradis, je suis un tisserand et designer de Val-David, Québec, Canada.</strong> Ça fait environ 16 ans que je me passionne pour les métiers de la fibre,  En 2013, j'ai démarré mon entreprise <strong><a href=""http://echeveaudivin.wixsite.com/lecheveaudivin"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">L'Écheveau Divin</a>,</strong> aussi connue pour certains, sous le nom de<strong> <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reddragonweaving/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Red Dragon Weaving</a></strong></p>
<p>Mes créations textiles, sont tissées main avec des fibres haut de gamme pour offrir des créations uniques, d'une beauté et d'une qualité incomparable. Les fibres utilisées sont issues du bébé alpaga, de la jeune chèvre mohair, de la laine mérinos, de la soie, et du bambou.  Chaque pièce est créée avec amour et dans le calme; l'environnement de création leur est alors transmis.</p>
<p><strong>J'ai reçu une très bonne nouvelle, je suis sélectionné pour une Exposition Internationale de Métiers d'Arts qui se tiendra ce novembre en France</strong>.  C'est une opportunité exceptionnelle, un grand pas dans ma carrière et je me sens honoré de pouvoir participer et surtout d'avoir été choisi pour l'ensemble de mes créations pour représenter le Québec et Val-David.</p>
<p>J'ai déboursé les frais de mon expo, j'ai acheté mon billet d'avion et maintenant je me lance dans le vide et je pratique mon lâcher-prise afin de remettre la suite à l'univers, c'est à dire vous :)</p>

<p><strong>Hi ! </strong></p>
<p><strong>My name is Renaud Paradis, I am a weaver and designer from Val-David, Quebec, Canada.</strong>  My passion for fiber arts began about sixteen years ago. In 2013 I launched my business <a href=""http://echeveaudivin.wixsite.com/lecheveaudivin"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">L'Écheveau Divin</a> , a.k.a. <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reddragonweaving/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Red Dragon Weaving</a> .</p>
<p>My creations are hand weaved by me with luxury hand dyed yarn to offer unique creations of unmatchable beauty and quality.  The fibers I use are: baby alpaca, kid-mohair, merino wool, silk and bamboo.  Each creation is weaved in an energy of love  and in a  peaceful environment.</p>
<p><strong>Lately I have received a wonderful news: I have been selected to participate at an Internationnal Arts and Crafts Show in France, this coming november. </strong> This is a great opportunity, a large step for my career and I feel honored to have been chosen for the  totality of my creations to represent the province of Quebec and the town of Val David, and of course my country Canada.</p>
<p>My booth is paid, as well as my plane ticket (leaving on the 29th of october), at this point I practice ""letting go"" and I hand over my life to the Universe, this means you :)</p>
<p>Your financial support would be greatly appreciated.  This chapter of my life sums up to a new adventure that has been offered to me in the present for a greater future. I need your contribution so I can realize this dream but mostly to have a safe business trip, fulfilled with happyness.</p>

<li>All of the gifts that are offered here are footprint of the energy of love and calm; Shawls, ponchos, dress, throws and murals will charm and dress fine fiber arts enthusiasts</li>
<li>I've set a fundraising goal of $2K. Even if I don't meet this goal, Indiegogo wil still release the funds raised for me and I'll still deliver the gifts that are ordered.  I will still go to France but lets say that I will be more limited with food supplys , transport and lodging on europeen territory.</li>
<li>If I raise more than $2K, up to this amount I will make a safe and happy business trip.  The exceeding funds will be reinvested to purchase yarn and weaving materials.</li>
</ul>

<p>My mission is to share to the largest number, this time in France, my passion for fiber arts in offering creations that are ultra-soft and of remarquable beauty and elegance.  (I also give weaving courses for this purpose but, at this time, in France it will not be possible).  With this adventure I will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share my passion and culture</li>
<li>Acquire new knowledge</li>
<li>Meet new business partners</li>

<p>To jump in an adventure like this might, for some people, seem out of the ordinary but for me and most of the people surrounding me, to believe in the Universe or in the abundance that is offered according to the energy that we resonate is common knowledge.  To live in this beautiful community has brought me a lot and I feel much gratitude; It has helped me to regain the self-confidence I had lost in the last chapter of my life.  I am now footprint of light and slowly I apply the knowledge acquired so one day more people shall benefit from it.</p>

<h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3>
<p>My name is Marianne Frisenvang and I have for the last 4 years had a close cooperation with a small cooperative producing sustainable handspund alpaca wool knitting yarn in an isolated village in the Marcapata region in Peru. </p>
<p>On my trips to Peru I visit areas usually not accessible for tourists. It is for me the ""real Peru"" to walk with the alpaca breeder Maruja among a herd of 400 alpacas, to visit a local school class in Marcapata or to watch the skilled artisans in the workshop handspinning my yarn.</p>
<p>The artisans, alpaca breeders in the High Andes and I will invite tourists to visit the outstanding and beautiful parts of the Hidden Peru.</p>
<p>This Indigogo project will support me and my partners in Peru setting up the tours. First tourist  trip is planned to be ready in May 2020.</p>
<p>Travels to <i>Hidden Peru</i> will be outstanding experiences for exploreres, will be empowerment of the local population and will create extra income for people in the remote areas presently living under the extreme poverty line.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555771798/wkm3lfgyal3ptnbvxr8i.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>The backside of the fantastic Peru</strong></p>
<p>When you as a tourist visit Peru there are lots of things to see. The country is so beautiful with breathtaking landscapes, fantastic cities and an amazing history. But only few visitors will even know that a big part of the Peruvians are struggling every single day to keep themselves alive and to create a better future for their children.</p>
<p>Climate changes have impacted the seasons: Winters with extreme cold temperatures and an extended rainy season with much larger quantities of rain make the already difficult living conditions even harsher. </p>
<p>The population in the high Andes primarily consists of alpaca breeders, craftsmen and agricultural workers. All these professions are relevant to those areas, but often they do not provide enough income for the families to live comfortably. The women living in the mountains are skilled craftswomen and they weave, knit and spin quality yarns. But the customer base in the local areas is extremely small, very few tourists or non at all are visiting the remote villages so sales of the wonderfull crafts does hardly generate any income. As a result 50% of the families live below the general or extreme poverty line, almost half of the children under the age of 5 are permanently malnourished and a large part of the population is illiterate.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555776927/wap24wtugouff3iixvnj.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>My <i>Hidden Peru</i></strong></p>
<p>My company Frisenvang has for the last 4 years had a close cooperation with a small cooperative producing sustainable hand spund alpaca wool knitting yarn in an isolated village in the Marcapata region. My company is a socio economic company with focus on supporting the local initiative in Marcapata (not building any profit to myself ).  My small Danish company is the only customer supporting the cooperative in the Andes Mountains.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555777540/prnvaqn9xtcexachsd7c.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The income the women receive from spinning yarn for Frisenvang has changed their lives and, in particular, it has been of great importance to the future of their children. Many families in the area live many hours walking distance from the nearest school, and as they previously could not afford to pay for the bus, their children rarely attended school. With increased income, the children can now go to school every day, which opens up a future with completely different opportunities compared to those their parents had.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555777431/hd3vd7cozt2vruhknpro.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Another major difference is their nutritional state. Previously their diet primarily consisted of a certain types of potatoes, which grow in the mountains, but it is now supplemented with meat and other foods.</p>
<p><strong>Why will tours to <i>Hidden Peru </i>be a success?</strong></p>
<p>Lots of agencies offer explorer trips typically with focus on hiking, rafting, climbing and home stays in Lake Titicaca. You can also visit workshops to see the skilled artisans produce woven and knitted textiles, but most of those places are very touristic.</p>
<p>The modern traveller wishes to do unique travels and this kind of organized tours with stays in small villages, attending crafts workshops and spending time with alpaca breeders and their animals is presently not available. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555767094/jbbmotlxeg4brjjxldsv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The target group will be wide; people interested in visiting the unknown and authenthic Peru</p>
<p>I already have a list of app. 40 persons interested in visiting The <i>Hidden Peru</i>.</p>
<p><strong>A trip to <i>Hidden Peru </i>will be truly unique</strong></p>
<p>To keep the visits unique and special the aim is to travel with only small groups with max 6-8 persons pr. group. In this way the focus in the programme can be decided from group to group. There can be tours with focus on yarn production and craftsmanship and groups with a stronger focus on hiking and nature experiences.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555778071/yc5qetlirtguc0fcyxgr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><u>Highlights of Hidden Perutour:</u></p>
<p>* Driving in the high Andes - an extremely beautifull trip in itself</p>
<p>* Lunch at altitude 4000 meters - the most delicate fried fish I have ever had</p>
<p>* Visit the women in the small workshop in Marcapata producing handspun yarn, take part  in     the production, for 1 full day </p>
<p>* Enjoy relaxing hours at the hot Springs in Marcapata</p>
<p>* Homestay with families in Marcapata</p>
<p>* Visit at a local school</p>
<p>* Stay at a small local mountain ranch at altitude 4200</p>
<p>* 4W drive in the isolated mountains to visit alpaca breeders Marua, Valentino and their 3 sons</p>
<p>* Walk around a herd of 400 alpacas and hold a baby alpaca</p>
<p>* Hike the fantastic lakes in San Martin</p>
<p><strong>Support of the UN sustainable development goals and impact on the population in the local areas </strong></p>
<p>The yarn production is the key income for the cooperative in Marcapata but I am constantly exploring new opportunities to add more businesses to the areas. </p>
<p>The<i> Hidden Peru</i> trips will add extra income for the local areas. The cooperative and the alpaca breeders will be paid hourly during the visits. Homestay and meals are paid at good rates for the area. Restaurants and hot springs will have new customers and the local businesses and small craftsmen will be able to sell their products at better prices than selling to the neighbours.</p>
<p>At school visits we will aim at having one of the guests or myself giving a small introduction about a specific topic from the visiting country, this will add new knowledge. </p>
<p>The production of Frisenvangyarn is done according to traditional methods which is organic and with less negative impact on the environment compared to most other yarn productions.</p>
<p>The Frisenvang yarn production and also the <i>Hidden Peru</i> trips will support several of the UN sustainable development goals.</p>

My name is Marianne Frisenvang and I have for the last 4 years had a close cooperation with a small cooperative producing sustainable handspund alpaca wool knitting yarn in an isolated village in the Marcapata region in Peru. 
On my trips to Peru I visit areas usually not accessible for tourists. It is for me the ""real Peru"" to walk with the alpaca breeder Maruja among a herd of 400 alpacas, to visit a local school class in Marcapata or to watch the skilled artisans in the workshop handspinning my yarn.
The artisans, alpaca breeders in the High Andes and I will invite tourists to visit the outstanding and beautiful parts of the Hidden Peru.
This Indigogo project will support me and my partners in Peru setting up the tours. First tourist  trip is planned to be ready in May 2020.
Travels to Hidden Peru will be outstanding experiences for exploreres, will be empowerment of the local population and will create extra income for people in the remote areas presently living under the extreme poverty line.


The backside of the fantastic Peru
When you as a tourist visit Peru there are lots of things to see. The country is so beautiful with breathtaking landscapes, fantastic cities and an amazing history. But only few visitors will even know that a big part of the Peruvians are struggling every single day to keep themselves alive and to create a better future for their children.
Climate changes have impacted the seasons: Winters with extreme cold temperatures and an extended rainy season with much larger quantities of rain make the already difficult living conditions even harsher. 
The population in the high Andes primarily consists of alpaca breeders, craftsmen and agricultural workers. All these professions are relevant to those areas, but often they do not provide enough income for the families to live comfortably. The women living in the mountains are skilled craftswomen and they weave, knit and spin quality yarns. But the customer base in the local areas is extremely small, very few tourists or non at all are visiting the remote villages so sales of the wonderfull crafts does hardly generate any income. As a result 50% of the families live below the general or extreme poverty line, almost half of the children under the age of 5 are permanently malnourished and a large part of the population is illiterate.

 
My Hidden Peru
My company Frisenvang has for the last 4 years had a close cooperation with a small cooperative producing sustainable hand spund alpaca wool knitting yarn in an isolated village in the Marcapata region. My company is a socio economic company with focus on supporting the local initiative in Marcapata (not building any profit to myself ).  My small Danish company is the only customer supporting the cooperative in the Andes Mountains.

The income the women receive from spinning yarn for Frisenvang has changed their lives and, in particular, it has been of great importance to the future of their children. Many families in the area live many hours walking distance from the nearest school, and as they previously could not afford to pay for the bus, their children rarely attended school. With increased income, the children can now go to school every day, which opens up a future with completely different opportunities compared to those their parents had.

Another major difference is their nutritional state. Previously their diet primarily consisted of a certain types of potatoes, which grow in the mountains, but it is now supplemented with meat and other foods.
Why will tours to Hidden Peru be a success?
Lots of agencies offer explorer trips typically with focus on hiking, rafting, climbing and home stays in Lake Titicaca. You can also visit workshops to see the skilled artisans produce woven and knitted textiles, but most of those places are very touristic.
The modern traveller wishes to do unique travels and this kind of organized tours with stays in small villages, attending crafts workshops and spending time with alpaca breeders and their animals is presently not available. 

The target group will be wide; people interested in visiting the unknown and authenthic Peru
I already have a list of app. 40 persons interested in visiting The Hidden Peru.
A trip to Hidden Peru will be truly unique
To keep the visits unique and special the aim is to travel with only small groups with max 6-8 persons pr. group. In this way the focus in the programme can be decided from group to group. There can be tours with focus on yarn production and craftsmanship and groups with a stronger focus on hiking and nature experiences.

Highlights of Hidden Perutour:
* Driving in the high Andes - an extremely beautifull trip in itself
* Lunch at altitude 4000 meters - the most delicate fried fish I have ever had
* Visit the women in the small workshop in Marcapata producing handspun yarn, take part  in     the production, for 1 full day 
* Enjoy relaxing hours at the hot Springs in Marcapata
* Homestay with families in Marcapata
* Visit at a local school
* Stay at a small local mountain ranch at altitude 4200
* 4W drive in the isolated mountains to visit alpaca breeders Marua, Valentino and their 3 sons
* Walk around a herd of 400 alpacas and hold a baby alpaca
* Hike the fantastic lakes in San Martin
Support of the UN sustainable development goals and impact on the population in the local areas 
The yarn production is the key income for the cooperative in Marcapata but I am constantly exploring new opportunities to add more businesses to the areas. 
The Hidden Peru trips will add extra income for the local areas. The cooperative and the alpaca breeders will be paid hourly during the visits. Homestay and meals are paid at good rates for the area. Restaurants and hot springs will have new customers and the local businesses and small craftsmen will be able to sell their products at better prices than selling to the neighbours.
At school visits we will aim at having one of the guests or myself giving a small introduction about a specific topic from the visiting country, this will add new knowledge. 
The production of Frisenvangyarn is done according to traditional methods which is organic and with less negative impact on the environment compared to most other yarn productions.
The Frisenvang yarn production and also the Hidden Peru trips will support several of the UN sustainable development goals.

Project budget
The objective of this Indiegogo project is to collect funds to do the final planning of project trips to The Hidden Peru.  I have been there several times and know which places worth visiting as a tourist and have the key contacts in place, so what is left is the detailed planning of the trips.
If this planning trip is not going to be executed, the funds collected from this Indigogo project will be transferred to the small community in Marcapata.

Timeline
Key milestones:
* July 2019 - Travel in Peru to set-up The Hidden Peru tours
* May 2020 - First The Hidden Peru Trips

The Aim is to execute 2-8 trips in 2020. For 2021 and the comming years the no. of trips can be increased. Trips can take place from May till September (to avoid the rain season where the remote areas can be difficult to vist).
Risk and challenges
A professional set-up will ensure smooth trips
To make sure the trips are planned professionally I have partnered up with an experienced travel agency to take care of booking of flights, payments and who will organize an add-on programme for those interested in seeing more of Peru after the trip to the Hidden Peru. Joining the trips will also be Ronald - member of the cooperative in Marcapata and my key contact in Peru and Martin - an experienced Peruvian guide and translator. Thus any possible questions about Peru, life in the Andes and the alpacas can be answered and this set-up will also ensure that the programme runs smoothly. We will also have a key contact at the travel association in Cusco who will be our support in unforeseen cases.
As the tours will be booked one by one and costs not committed until each group is fully booked there are no financial risk involved.
Your help means a lot
The families in Marcapata, alpaca bredders in San Martin and I will be extremely greatfull if you support the Hidden Peru project. We will be happy for any bagging amount but you can also help us spreading the word through social media. Remember to use the Indiegogo share tools.",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Dianne and Tamara love books. We really love books. We love books so much we opened a bookstore. Crazy? Nah! But we do need $10,000 to get our bricks and mortar store completely fixtured. Here's a bit about us:</h3>
<p>A typical date is a trip to the used bookstore before or maybe after dinner, or after heading out to do some birding.  This is an old-married-couple-nerdy-conversation, which is basically all of our conversations really:</p>
<p>""Bird! Some kind of Hawk!""</p>
<p>""Awesome. Red Tailed? I don't know, I don't have the guidebook. Where's the guidebook?""</p>
<p>""Oh! There's a heron!"" (Dianne takes many photographs of herons.)</p>
<p> ""It's cold, let's go get warm... where is the closest bookstore? We need a new guidebook."" </p>
<p>We know all the used book stores from Point Grey to Hope, and all along the Oregon Coast too! And Powell's Books. Ahhh Powell's. We dream of trips down the I5, and don't even care about the bumper to bumper traffic from Everett to Olympia, Powell's is at the end of that journey...</p>
<p>We built the store through a long year which unfortunately did not include a trip to Powell's Books. Just as Tamara started her self-employment program at the local college to learn how the heck to become a small business person, she was diagnosed with Lymphoma. Large B cell cancer death tumor of doom whatever whatever. Scary stuff. Our friend Robyn helped with the final drafting and editing of the business plan, which had to be submitted 3 days after the first chemo treatment. Dianne juggled her work in the floral industry, our other family obligations, and care for Tamara (as she ended up in hospital several times throughout treatment.) Family and friends helped in innumerable ways (our kids and grand-kids and  best-besties most especially) and everyone encouraged us towards wellness and to keep the bookstore dream alive. </p>
<p>Well the cancer is gone, and by the good grace of having been born and continuing to live in Canada, the medical care has been excellent and we are not bankrupt. So we got to continue with the  work of creating our independent, community based bookstore! We are so grateful for this chance! We pinch ourselves every single day that this gets to be our lives: words, books, stories. So many amazing stories.</p>
<p>Donations of books come in regularly, and all the little generosities of everyday people  allowed us to open our doors. We mean it about the smiles and the hugs, particularly from our customers at the local markets this summer and fall.</p>
<p>So we're open and starting to sell books as people find us and we've booked our first readings with local writers. But our space does not have much electricity - we got some light fixtures put in and a few outlets, but we need more lights and more power. We also do not have a sign on the front of the store, which requires permitting from the city, working with the outer shell of the building to get some electrical out there,  as well as the design and creation of the sign. With a second bathroom, we can have many more people attending our events, so we can really become the vibrant literary hub we're dreaming of. And all these books need to get onto more shelves. We got shelves but we need more.</p>
<p>$10,000 is our request of you, fellow book lovers and believers in all things indie, who want to shop local and dig through stacks to find that one book, and then the next, who want to share their favourite book from childhood with their children, grandchildren, nieces and nephews, or their new or long time companion, who want to support local writers,  who want to walk into a place that feels and smells like home, and who just want a place in the world where things are alright and good and peaceful for a minute or an hour. Bookstores are all of these things. Western Sky Books hopes to be all of these things to all of you. </p>
<p>We are loosely Oz themed, so everyone who donates will be thanked with their name being added to a brick on the yellow brick road which will weave through the store by the end of the campaign. We'll also offer $10 gift certificates to every donor of $100 or more.</p>
<p>We understand that not everyone can contribute money. We ask if you are in this situation, that you forward our links on to other folks through your networks. Let us know you did and if one of your folks contributes, we'll still add your name, to acknowledge your contribution. And all of you who brought us books, or who will in the future, your names will be added too,</p>
<p>We are learning as we go, and we understand this request is a big one. Tamara has managed projects in the non-profit and social housing sector for a long time, so you can be sure that every dollar will be accounted for and and spent wisely.  If we don't quite make goal, that's ok; we'll adjust our plans and make sure you all know what we  accomplish now and we will will plan for the future.</p>

We named the Game Center JoeGs after our two sons JoVon (8yrs old) & Gianni (11yrs old). By introducing our next generation arcade to Lakeside Mall in Sterling Heights, MI,JoeGs Game Center is a unique spin on an old gaming conceptThere may be hope for parents who have a hard time getting their kids out the house to go shopping at the mall and parents with love ones that are more introverted but love gaming.
