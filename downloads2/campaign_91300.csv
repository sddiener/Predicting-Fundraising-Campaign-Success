<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Frequently Asked Questions</b></p>
<p><b>Q: </b>How ASO is safer than other email and cloud clients?</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>A: </b>Traditional email and Cloud
providers like uses their own server in a place full of random people.  The chances are extremely high of your
important files falling into somebody else’s hands. With AirSpaceOne you have
your own private server that all your emails are sent to that is in the privacy
of your own home or office only offering the people you want to have access to
it. </p>
<p><b>Q:</b> Do I need to continuously run
my server to get emails? If so, what happens if the power goes out?</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>A:</b> Yes, you need to continuously
run your server to get emails. The server should be connected to a power source
at all times in an uninterrupted way. But do not worry, AirSpaceOne servers
have a built in lithium battery that won’t let the servers experience any down
time due to power shortages. The lithium built in battery allows up to 8 hours
of video play back. </p>
<p><b>Q:</b> Is there any monthly or
reoccurring fees?</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>A:</b> Our email and cloud service is
absolutely free. There is only a one time purchase cost for your own private
AirSpaceOne server, and you can choose different plans listed in the “Perks
Section”. </p>
<p><b><b>Q:</b></b> Can AirSpaceOne have multiple
accounts set up on one single server?</p>
<p><b><b>A: </b></b>Yes, You can set up to 5 accounts
per server.(We are working to add more accounts)</p>
<p><b>Q:</b> Why do we need funds?</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>A:</b> On Average we have to invest
50+ hours per week to get the project completed before December 2013. Funding
helps ensure that we reach our deadline as well as making any enhancements
possible.  Also, funding helps with
marketing expenses to promote the product and ensure the first set of
productions of AirSpaceOne servers.</p>

my server to get emails? If so, what happens if the power goes out?
A: Yes, you need to continuously
run your server to get emails. The server should be connected to a power source
at all times in an uninterrupted way. But do not worry, AirSpaceOne servers
have a built in lithium battery that won’t let the servers experience any down
time due to power shortages. The lithium built in battery allows up to 8 hours
of video play back. 
Q: Is there any monthly or
reoccurring fees?
A: Our email and cloud service is
absolutely free. There is only a one time purchase cost for your own private
AirSpaceOne server, and you can choose different plans listed in the “Perks
Section”. 
Q: Can AirSpaceOne have multiple
accounts set up on one single server?
A: Yes, You can set up to 5 accounts
per server.(We are working to add more accounts)
Q: Why do we need funds?
A: On Average we have to invest
50+ hours per week to get the project completed before December 2013. Funding
helps ensure that we reach our deadline as well as making any enhancements
possible.  Also, funding helps with
marketing expenses to promote the product and ensure the first set of
productions of AirSpaceOne servers.

</p><h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Gary, the Founder of GAMER, THE beverage brand created specifically for...the video gamer. Many moons ago I was watching my teenage son play video games, when the idea for GAMER popped into my noggin. My 3 boys, relatives &amp; friends all loved the concept, but what were the odds that one of the ""big boys"" didn't already own the trademark for such an obvious name...a brand for gamers called GAMER? We hired a great attorney and were very pleasantly surprised to find no such trademark! With great excitement, we decided as a family to trademark the name &amp; get to work creating a delicious, high quality brand with the video game enthusiast in mind!</p>
<p>We launched GAMER as a soda, May, 2009, and continue to operate locally as a family business. GAMER receives awesome consumer feedback wherever we sample, so it's time to improve access to beverage enthusiats everywhere. Expanding production into non-breakable containers will help make GAMER more readily accessible for our fans.</p>
<p>Importantly, we have benefited as a family from charitable organizations &amp; have made it our mission to give back too! Expanding our business gives us more opportunity to help local &amp; nationals causes!</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise $44,000 in funds to package 2 of our most popular GAMER flavors, puchase a gently worn delivery van, and provide warehousing, marketing, and insurance as part of this next step. We will co-pack in cans primarily because the shelf life is 4x longer than plastic. Unlike our current glass bottle packaging, cans are high-volume fill, which means you have to commit a significant amount of dough before you fill your 1st can. This includes design &amp; pre-purchase of thousands of cases of printed empty cans. When it's time to fill, minimum runs are 1,000 cases...enought to fill a tractor trailer. Once packaged, we need to pay for shipping &amp; warehousing before we're ready to start delivering to customers. We have many pre-orders for GAMER from non-retail vendors...rec baseball programs, skateboard parks, hockey arenas, paintball fields, etc. Since our distributors serve retailers only, a delivery van becomes critical.</p>
<p>In return for your generous &amp; most appreciated support, we have a bunch of exciting perks! GAMER stickers, pens, koozies, t-shirts, hats, hoodies, and of course, our delicious GAMER soda! If you're a collector, we have a unique offerring: autographed &amp; authenticated GAMER soda packs from our very 1st production run! Imagine if GAMER goes worldwide someday!</p>
<p>Initial costs for the 1st production run is approximately $12,000 per flavor. If we don't hit our goal of $44,000, we will aim to co-pack 1 flavor at this time. </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>GAMER started as a name, but will always be more than just trendy branding. GAMER is all about quality! Sweetened with real sugar, fortified with vitamins, and never a trace of artificial colors or high fructose corn syrup. Better ingredients + light carbonation = a very refreshing soda experience with GAMER!</p>
<p>A number of our more mature GAMER fans have inquired about an ""energy"" version. This is part of our original business plan, and success with the expansion into non-breakable containers could get things in motion sooner for GAMER Energy. Our sodas were carefully planned &amp; created as a ""hybrid"" beverage, so we promise to do the same with an energy drink. GAMER Energy will be BOTH functional &amp; delicious!</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>The US &amp; World economy has been tough for a long time now, so we understand if you are not able to contribute. Either way, we would love everyone's support to spread the word about GAMER and help bring friends &amp; family to our campaign through IndieGogo quick links.</p>
<p>From our family at DSJ Beverages, LLC, THANK YOU SO MUCH for your support!</p>
<p>Best Wishes, Gary</p></div>","Short Summary

The goal of this project is to build a free web-based version of our software development tool LogicGem. LogicGem is a logic processor and decision table analysis tool. LogicGem has a two-fold audience, software developers (programmers) and business analysts (non-programmers). The common thread between these two diverse groups is that they both need to design logically complete business rules.
For the programmer, the business rules are in fact functional requirements for a software application that are translated into a programming language that becomes part of the application. For the business analyst or domain expert, the same need exists with the exception of translating the logic to a programming language. Business analysts need to develop concise business rules that represent real life or proposed business processes and these processes need to be every bit as logically robust as a software implementation. Collectively, we can refer to both groups of programmers and business analysts as a ""logic engineer"".



Figure 1 - LogicGem Logic Editor
LogicGem is a software tool called a ""logic processor"" that addresses these issues using decision table theory. LogicGem consists of a logic editor, and logic compiler. With the logic editor shown above, you can create logic tables — spreadsheet-like constructions that encapsulate a set of logical rules.
Much of the effort in software development does not involve writing code, but rather the process of covering every possible combination of circumstances — user input, database transaction, or any other event — that the program will encounter. When the programmer or analyst overlooks a possible combination of inputs or events, the program may do things essentially at random. Even worse are errors made during program maintenance, usually by programmers who do not fully understand the interaction between dozens of different possibilities. As it is, logical analysis is tedious and error prone: it's easy to omit, duplicate, or contradict conditions.
 
Figure 2 - LogicGem Finds Missing, Redundant and Contradictory Rules
The LogicGem logic processor is designed to provide a familiar, easy-to-use way to create, edit, verify and compile decision table logic. LogicGem's logic tables express a problem visually, making it easy to understand. One part of a table contains conditions that can be linked to create a rule, and the other part contains actions that are related to the rules.
Once you've defined the rules, to ensure that a table's logic is complete, unambiguous and contains every applicable rule in an expanded or reduced format, the editor will automatically analyze them, add missing rules, and remove those that are redundant or contradictory. Decision table technology is the vehicle by which logically complete business rules may be constructed.
 


Figure 3 - LogicGem Generates Your Source Code
When you're done perfecting the rules, the logic compiler is available to generate source code in Basic, C, C++, Fortran, FoxPro, Java, Pascal, PowerBuilder, SAS, Visual Basic, Visual Basic.NET, Visual C#.NET, or Xbase programming languages.
 
Figure 4 - LogicGem Generates English for Documentation
The compiler will produce a set of English, Spanish, French or German rules that can be used as documentation or as a knowledge base. LogicGem provides the means to prototype and expand a high-level procedural concept into a decision table, work it through analysis and design phases, and then generate English language documentation.

This will mean more logically complete business rules and processes and software with fewer bugs. In order to get a better idea of how LogicGem works, here are two tutorial videos:

You can read all about LogicGem by going to our Technical Reference guide and our QuickStart Guide (PDF) is also available.
You can also download a FREE 30-day trial version of LogicGem (without a serial number, LogicGem will install as a fully functional evaluation copy).
What We Need & What You Get
In order to pull this off we need to fund a development project that will take the C source code of our current downloadable software and convert it to run on the web. We'll also need funding for hosting services.For LogicGem product rewards, you can download the Trial version above (which is the fully functioning product just without a serial number) and we will e-mail you your LogicGem serial number within 24 hours.

<p>We
designed the iShove Wallet because we think that most of the iPhone wallets on
the market are making your iPhone very bulky, hard to use and ugly to look at. The
iShove Wallet hasn’t got these problems. It has a beautiful look, is very thin,
it has got a credit card stand and you can always use your iPhone easily.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>Your iPhone still looks beautiful!</h2>
<p>The front view of the iPhone is more beautiful created by the aluminum bumper, which also gives your iPhone a good protection.  </p>
<p>The back side is made from a high-quality high-gloss plastic that also gives the back side a nice look. </p>

<h2>You can cary everything you need with instand access to your iPhone</h2>
<p>The iShove Wallet is able to carry 4 cards and 3 bills in the card section and there’s a secret compartment where you can stash 2 keys.  Of course you can use it in the way you like. You can also use the secret compartment to stash a bill, some coins or for example your medications. And you can use the card section to carry less cards and more bills and business cards, that’s your choice. </p>

""iShove Wallet"" - Beautiful iPhone 5/5S Wallet Case With Card Stand""

Where the idea came from
We
designed the iShove Wallet because we think that most of the iPhone wallets on
the market are making your iPhone very bulky, hard to use and ugly to look at. The
iShove Wallet hasn’t got these problems. It has a beautiful look, is very thin,
it has got a credit card stand and you can always use your iPhone easily.

Your iPhone still looks beautiful!
The front view of the iPhone is more beautiful created by the aluminum bumper, which also gives your iPhone a good protection.  
The back side is made from a high-quality high-gloss plastic that also gives the back side a nice look. 







You can cary everything you need with instand access to your iPhone
The iShove Wallet is able to carry 4 cards and 3 bills in the card section and there’s a secret compartment where you can stash 2 keys.  Of course you can use it in the way you like. You can also use the secret compartment to stash a bill, some coins or for example your medications. And you can use the card section to carry less cards and more bills and business cards, that’s your choice. 




The iShove Wallet is very thin


The total thickness is limited to 0.6 inches, which is much thinner than most iPhone Wallets on the market and it fits perfectly in your pocket.






The ingenious credit card stand


The iShove
Wallet even has a credit card stand that allows you to put your iPhone in
portrait of landscape mode. It’s very easy to use. You only need to get a card
from your iShove Wallet and the stand is ready to use.
The built-in credit card stand is very useful if you for example want to watch a movie on your iPhone. 
The credit card stand is also very good to use as stand for the iPhone navigation in your car.

<h3>Finally something that solves YOUR problem!</h3>
<p>Tabber lets you order anything at restaurants and bars without having to wait for service! Just get a table, open Tabber on your smartphone and select whatever you want from the menu. The order goes directly to the restaurant without having to talk to anyone. You also pay your tab with Tabber, eliminating any delay in your dining experience!</p>
<p>I'm sure YOU had this problem many times, haven't you? Waiting for the menu, waiting to place an order, waiting to pay the tab... There is a whole lot of waiting in the way restaurants operate - which can be translated into FRUSTRATION for the customer and INEFFICIENCY for the venue.</p>
<p>Tabber solves this issue forever - no more waiting! All of it within a single app that works in any registered restaurant. Check it out, it is available both in the App Store and Google Play.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our History</h3>
<p>It all started when four of us were trying to order another drink at a restaurant... The waiter was nowhere to be found, and while we waited in frustration, we were all browsing on our smartphones. </p>
<p>BINGO! Why not order our drinks with our own smartphones? Why wait for the server to come to our table? At that moment, TABBER was born.</p>
<p>After developing the technology we ran a pilot program with 8 restaurants for 4 months, and the results were amazing! Everyone loved the experience and the restaurants were very happy to see that people using Tabber spent on average <strong>24.5% more than their regular customers</strong>! </p>
<p>With over 65 years of combined professional experience in technology, and top-level business track record, our team took the idea and turned it into a world-class solution that is already operational in the USA and Brazil on a small scale.</p>
<p>What we need right now are the resources to aggressively execute our go-to-market strategy to make our technology widely available in restaurants all over the US. Together, we can change the restaurant experience forever!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Will do With Your Money &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Now that we already have the technology in place, we are asking for US$ 50,000 to get us started in promoting Tabber and spreading the word. We will hire a couple of sales people and spend some cash in social media campaigns. Obviously, what we are asking is not enough to really take us all the way, but we take it one step at a time. With the progress generated by this amount, we will be in a much better position to raise more if necessary - and to start generating our own consistent revenue that will be re-invested into the company. Our only goal is to have as many restaurants as possible.</p>
<p>In order to express our gratitude towards your involvement in this cause, we have set up a few rewards:</p>
<p> $1 - You get a Thank You email with some inside scoop about our plans;</p>
<p>$10 - Your name in the ""credits"" page in our website;</p>
<p>$20 - Your name in the ""credits"" page in our mobile apps + all of the above;</p>
<p>$40 - Get a Tabber ""Early Supporter"" t-shirt + all of the above;</p>
<p>$60 - Get a $10 coupon on Tabber + all of the above;</p>
<p>$100 - Get a $20 coupon on Tabber + all of the above;</p>
<p>$400 - Get five $10 coupons to give to your friends + all of the above;</p>
<p>$1,000 - Get a special personalized Tabber app + all of the above;</p>
<p>$5,000 - Tabber Task Force for two days to get restaurants signed up in your area (USA) + all of the above;</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>One of the most important rewards that everyone gets automatically is the fact that you will be helping us to get Tabber installed in restaurants near you very soon!</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>

<p>** Share Tabber's campaign with your friends on Twitter, Facebook or anything else that can help us reach more people.</p>
<p>** Talk to restaurants in your area and ask them to reach out to us. They can start using Tabber for free and without any risk! The email is restaurant@tabber.pro</p>
<p> </p>
</div></div>","Finally something that solves YOUR problem!
Tabber lets you order anything at restaurants and bars without having to wait for service! Just get a table, open Tabber on your smartphone and select whatever you want from the menu. The order goes directly to the restaurant without having to talk to anyone. You also pay your tab with Tabber, eliminating any delay in your dining experience!
I'm sure YOU had this problem many times, haven't you? Waiting for the menu, waiting to place an order, waiting to pay the tab... There is a whole lot of waiting in the way restaurants operate - which can be translated into FRUSTRATION for the customer and INEFFICIENCY for the venue.
Tabber solves this issue forever - no more waiting! All of it within a single app that works in any registered restaurant. Check it out, it is available both in the App Store and Google Play.
 
Our History
It all started when four of us were trying to order another drink at a restaurant... The waiter was nowhere to be found, and while we waited in frustration, we were all browsing on our smartphones. 
BINGO! Why not order our drinks with our own smartphones? Why wait for the server to come to our table? At that moment, TABBER was born.
After developing the technology we ran a pilot program with 8 restaurants for 4 months, and the results were amazing! Everyone loved the experience and the restaurants were very happy to see that people using Tabber spent on average 24.5% more than their regular customers! 
With over 65 years of combined professional experience in technology, and top-level business track record, our team took the idea and turned it into a world-class solution that is already operational in the USA and Brazil on a small scale.
What we need right now are the resources to aggressively execute our go-to-market strategy to make our technology widely available in restaurants all over the US. Together, we can change the restaurant experience forever!
 


What We Will do With Your Money & What You Get
Now that we already have the technology in place, we are asking for US$ 50,000 to get us started in promoting Tabber and spreading the word. We will hire a couple of sales people and spend some cash in social media campaigns. Obviously, what we are asking is not enough to really take us all the way, but we take it one step at a time. With the progress generated by this amount, we will be in a much better position to raise more if necessary - and to start generating our own consistent revenue that will be re-invested into the company. Our only goal is to have as many restaurants as possible.
In order to express our gratitude towards your involvement in this cause, we have set up a few rewards:
 $1 - You get a Thank You email with some inside scoop about our plans;
$10 - Your name in the ""credits"" page in our website;
$20 - Your name in the ""credits"" page in our mobile apps + all of the above;
$40 - Get a Tabber ""Early Supporter"" t-shirt + all of the above;
$60 - Get a $10 coupon on Tabber + all of the above;
$100 - Get a $20 coupon on Tabber + all of the above;
$400 - Get five $10 coupons to give to your friends + all of the above;
$1,000 - Get a special personalized Tabber app + all of the above;
$5,000 - Tabber Task Force for two days to get restaurants signed up in your area (USA) + all of the above;
 
One of the most important rewards that everyone gets automatically is the fact that you will be helping us to get Tabber installed in restaurants near you very soon!

<p>BrokeMyCell.com was launched in October 2012 with $60,000 by a father of 2 young boys. Our founder having shattered the screen on a once brand new Samsung Galaxy S3 concluded that he had no repair options and the replacement cost for the phone was $649. By accident a glaring need for a professional, accessible, and affordable cell phone repair solution was identified.</p>
<p>BrokeMyCell offers affordable repair solutions for the current most expensive and popular mobile phones and devices. By concentrating parts and technical talent on the most common repair problems: Broken Glass Screens, and LCD's. BrokeMyCell.com is able to offer competitive prices and industry leading technical expertise.</p>
<p>The majority of consumers do not have cell phone insurance and those that do find out the that a $200 deductible is typically required for popular phones including iPhones and Galaxy devices. Not to mention the $10-$15+ a month the customer pays for the 'peace of mind' of having insurance.</p>
<p>When customers contact BrokeMyCell and learn that most of our screen replacement repairs are around $100 to $150 they are thrilled. The days of a $50 flip-phone are long gone replaced by devices in our pockets and purses that cost closer to $1,000 so an affordable repair service provider has become a necessity. </p>

It then optimises the images, reducing the file size by 90%, keeping beautiful gorgeous copies on your phone, even offline.

With the IceCream Camera you can take full resolution, gorgeous photos - and back those up to the secure IceCream Cloud instantly. But we keep only an optimise version on your device to save space. That's clever. And means you can take 10x more photos. That's sweet.</span></p><p></p> <p></p><h3><br/></h3><p></p><h3>Don't Apple and Dropbox already do this?</h3><p>NO! They don't. We've been devotees of Apple and Dropbox for years, but we don't think their solutions are good enough. Let's explain why:</p><p></p><ol>
<li>
<b>Limited and Expensive Storage</b>. Dropbox costs $120 (£70) per year for the cheapest option (and they only give you 2 Gb of storage for free). Apple is also expensive, with the cheapest option (not launching until late 2014) costing $12 (£7) per year but it only offers a fraction of the Dropbox storage.<br/><br/>
</li>

The Goal for IceCream is to Free Up Space on your iPhone, and do it Fast.


Find out more at: www.givemeicecream.com   IceCream offers 3 KEY FEATURES:   1 . Free Up Space On Demand   2. Do it Fast   3. Space-Saving Camera1. FREE UP SPACEImagine a clever app that allows you to Free Up Space for 250, 1000, 2,500 or even 5,000 more photos on demand. Wouldn't that be a dream come true? Imagine if the app could tell you when you only had space for a few more photos, or even intelligently began freeing up space for you? That's what IceCream does.IceCream backs up a fixed number of original, full resolution photos to the secure IceCream Cloud (build on Amazon's massively robust, scalable and safe data centers). It then optimises the images, reducing the file size by 90%, keeping beautiful gorgeous copies on your phone, even offline. We then help you remove the big images from your device (now that they're safe in the Cloud).2. SPEED IS GOODThrough some amazing technology, and our experience at Imperial and MIT, we've been able to make both the backing up process, and the image optimisation process super fast. We have Free Up Space for 250 more photos in about 40 seconds, and for 2,500 photos in about 2 minutes. That's magic.
3. A Space Saving CameraIceCream also gives you a great alternative to the default camera app. With the IceCream Camera you can take full resolution, gorgeous photos - and back those up to the secure IceCream Cloud instantly. But we keep only an optimise version on your device to save space. That's clever. And means you can take 10x more photos. That's sweet. Don't Apple and Dropbox already do this?NO! They don't. We've been devotees of Apple and Dropbox for years, but we don't think their solutions are good enough. Let's explain why:

Limited and Expensive Storage. Dropbox costs $120 (£70) per year for the cheapest option (and they only give you 2 Gb of storage for free). Apple is also expensive, with the cheapest option (not launching until late 2014) costing $12 (£7) per year but it only offers a fraction of the Dropbox storage.


No Organisation. Too Complex. Unfortunately Dropbox is not integrated with a camera app, doesn't auto-organise your photos and doesn't make it easy to create or share albums. Apple, similarly makes it complicated with three different products - Camera, Photos and iCloud. Why can't it be one single app? Why can't it be organised a lot better?


Anti-Social. Dropbox is designed for files, not photos. As a result its not particularly social. It doesn't even have a friend list to show you who's sharing what with you? Similarly, Apple has never managed to make their products social. Even the iCloud Photo Stream feature is clunky at best, and could be made soooo much better.

<h3>What is StartupBus?</h3>
<p>StartupBus is loved by Time Magazine, Inc., Huffington Post, Techcrunch, and many news channels including CNN, ABC7 etc. StartupBus is in its 4th year of competition. The goal is for teams to create, develop, and pitch a new startup while on-board a bus bound for South-by-Southwest (SXSW) in Austin TX. This year's trip will have a camera crew on-board to document the journey for a television reality show or documentary release.</p>
<p>I have been selected to be on-board the westcoast bus traveling to Austin starting in San Francisco on March 3, 2013. Along the way I will form a team, build an idea, get customers, make buzz on internet and prepare a pitch for competition against the other teams/buses.</p>
<p>Besides this great journey with entrepeneurs, the winners might get funding from an investor and build a viable business. At the very least, it is an opportunity for me to exercise my business/strategy knowledge and develop relationships in the StartupBus community that I can bring back to my hometown San Jose, CA</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>I am Prateek Gupta, and I am a 23 years old broke cofounder/CEO of a promising startup based in Silicon Valley. We are currently seeking investment round, and getting good attention out there. </p>
<p>I am living with my parents to pursue my startup dream, and make it big in the Valley. 100% of my time is dedicated to my unpaid job at my startup, and I am learning and making so many things possible to change the way people communicate through video conferencing. (more on that in the link below)</p>
<p>In June 2012, I started my startup with a friend, made a solid team out of a San Francisco hackathon, won second place there. We launched the company at DEMO Fall Conference in October 2012 with full scholarship and valuation of $1.5 million among 75 startups from 15 countries. (more on that in the links below)</p>
<p>The reason I want to join this startupbus so desparately is because I want to learn and meet great people who are on a mission to start new things to change the world. Currently, I have around $350 dollars in cash, and I have no idea where I will be living in Austin, and where I will be eating. This is why I need your help.</p>

<h3>Why FroipMe?</h3>
<p>IP-based calling is the wave of the future, with companies like Vonage and Magic Jack causing significant disruptions in the business models of local and regional companies. Many people wonder - when will this same revolution occur in mobile phones?</p>
<p>The answer? Right now.</p>
<p>Simply put, Froip.me transforms your smartphone into a hybrid internet phone. Using your current dialer and contact list, Froip.me transmits your calls via the internet. Unlike current mobile VoIP apps, which require you to install and use a separate dialer and contact list, Froip.me operates entirely in the background, intercepting the calls you make and transmitting them via the internet. This gives you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlimited talk time WITHOUT a cell phone voice plan (Save $500 or more per year!)</li>
<li>FREE calls to the United States from anywhere in the world (requires WiFi or data connection)</li>
<li>Crystal-clear call quality</li>
<li>Freedom from talk limits, coverage gaps, and roaming charges</li>
<li>The ability to call from 3G, 4G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or any other mobile internet connection</li>
</ul>
<p>And best of all, there is no new app interface to learn! Froip.me users can call any US number (even non-Froip.me users) for free!</p>
<p>Our goal is to provide unlimited, FREE voice communication worldwide. We have developed an Android app and voice communications service that will serve as the backbone of this effort. With just $9,999 in contributions and a pilot group of 2000-2500 founding users, we can begin making this goal a reality. With a contribution of as little as $4, you can be one of these founding users and help revolutionize the way the world talks.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As a founding member, you'll get access to the Froip.me app months before it becomes available to the general public, and you'll be able to help drive the development and evolution of our service to suit your needs.</p>
<p>Today, we have a working mobile application, a proven voice server architecture, and some initial agreements with phone carriers in the United States. We're less than a month away from launching our service, but we need a little bit of help to get the rest of the way there. Our upcoming needs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scaling our server systems to support large volumes of concurrent calls</li>
<li>2000-2500 founding users for a pilot program to test our offering and gather vital user feedback</li>
<li>Finishing development of our first application based on user feedback</li>
<li>Securing long-term contracts with call termination providers to guarantee free service years into the future</li>
</ul>
<p>To make it worth your while, here's what we're offering:</p>
<ul>
<li>Participation in our beta/pilot program - get free, unlimited calls starting in January, months before the general public!</li>
<li>Invitations for your friends and family to join before the service is generally available</li>
<li>An edgy Froip t-shirt with text of your choosing! (subject to review; threatening, hateful or obscene text may be refused at our discretion)</li>
<li>A Wi-Fi-enabled Android phone with the Froip.me application pre-installed and configured: Ditch your cell phone provider!</li>
</ul>
<p>Contributors participating in the beta will start receiving their copies of the application in mid- to late January, before the campaign is even over! If we hit our $10k goal, beta users will begin receiving their invitations within 30 days of the end of the campaign, and the free Froip.me service to be publicly available in the first half of 2013.</p>
<p>If we don't hit our funding goal, all money raised will fund the pilot program for all founding members; however, the invitations and public launch may be delayed.</p>
<p>If we raise $20,000 or more, ALL founding users will have the opportunity to join our ongoing Froip.me Focus Group - a group of individuals who get access to key Froip.me features and upgrades before the general public. These users will have the opportunity to be involved in deciding which features are developed and improved infuture versions.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>James Hammons and Pervez Syed started Froip.me after meeting at Thunderbird School of Global Management. As frequent international travelers with heavy calling needs, we understand the frustration with today's mobile phone market. We're paying outrageous monthly plan rates, coupled with exorbitant international use fees, to do something as simple as transmit voice communication. There is a better way.</p>
<p>We envision a world where communication in ALL forms is unbound by geography, home network, time of day and minute allotments - where your voice is as free and ubiquitous as the internet. Froip.me is a critical first step to bringing this world to life.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">Developed and enhanced based on our acclaimed hybrid system, W900 is at the summit of our ideology of fusing the best traits out of dynamic and balanced armature drivers. Instead of creating high order RC crossover network, which usually causes chaotic phase shift and scrambled arrival timing, AAW uses a complete new approach called TrueXross to solve the classic coherence issue in hybrid earphones. The dynamic driver is proprietary tuned diaphragm wise and by further utilizing a physical low pass filter, it is to only function in minimal overlapping frequency range as opposed to the balanced armature driver. Coupled with delicate positional arrangement and front acoustic chamber design, AAW is able to achieve improved coherence, minimized phase shift and optimized arrival timing of music signal.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1313/3711/files/IMG_0912____1_grande.jpg?v=1480357373"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;"">W900 is designed to be true reference equipment, it offers powerful yet natural sub bass which you will never find in a full balanced armature CIEM. The 4 way crossover network configures dedicated woofer, mid, treble and super tweeters. Inherited AAW's highly praised musical imaging, instrument separation and realistic sound stage, W900 steps up the game by offering extended treble and superior detail retrieval. The end result being a high-end speaker like performance condensed in a tiny footprint of CIEM.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1313/3711/files/A1D_11-30_grande.png?v=1480496121"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;"">AAW worked with the best balanced armature maker in the world to develop the bespoke super tweeter drivers used in W900. It ensures non-compromising sound pressure all the way up to 20kHz and further extends to 40kHz. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1313/3711/files/W900FR-2_1024x1024.png?v=1480496296"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;"">Suitable for stage performers, recording studio, audio engineers and the most critical audiophiles. Every AAW custom is customised to fill exact cavity of your ears. The CIEM experience is started with a trip to audiologist to have ear impressions taken and AAW will carefully craft the monitor shells mirroring their shapes. Delicately tuned and matched transducers are then mounted into the shells to create a one of a kind earpiece for you and you only. Universal shape for W900 is also available.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><strong><u>1. How do I tell a Lightning audio device is authentic MFI approved?</u></strong><br/>A. If you find your Lightning audio solution does not have one of the following traits: 1) three button array 2) capable to update firmware through iDevice 3) Flexible padding on the Lightning connector where it connects to iDevice, then regardless of its form factor, earphone, cable or adapter, it is probably hacked or fake (with exception to Apple’s own product). Moreover, phone call function is not mandatory on authentic accessories but fake solutions can’t realise this function anyway. So if your Lightning earphones have a nice remote control but unable to make phone calls, it is probably fake.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;""><strong><u><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">2. What would happen if a Lightning audio device is not MFI approved?</span></u></strong><br/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">A. It most likely uses a hacked chipset to communicate with iDevice. Any future iOS update may change protocol and rendering this device useless.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><strong><u>3. How do I know if my earphone has 2PIN or MMCX connector?</u></strong><br/>A. Popular IEM with MMCX connector:</span></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><strong><u>9. Why balanced audio signal?</u></strong><br/>A. It has been hotly debated in the audiophile community for decades, still we have seen it implemented in a slew of high end portable audio players. In a battery driven, low power scenario, we think it offers significant benefit in terms of noise reduction and power amplification. For working principle of balanced audio signal path, see this <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balanced_audio"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">link</a>.</span></p>

</div></div>","Meet Capri

To avoid the bulk of carrying amp stack or navigating through some awkwardly designed UI and laggy OS on digital audio players, Capri is AAW's latest offering for ultra portable music application. Designed to achieve Hi-Res music on-the-go and stay uncompromised on sound quality and mobility. 

Without internal battery, storage, screen, complex operating system software, Capri uses your iPhone for these non-audio related functions and really focuses on the sound design while lowering the overall cost. Therefore we can deliver sound quality which usually costs a few hundred dollars at a fraction of the price tag. Here comes Capri, barely bigger than the footprint of a traditional analog IEM cable, it brings an entirely new breed of portable audio experience on the table!




 


 
Capri can be ordered as complete earphone package with Capri In-Ear Monitor or standalone cable with MMCX/2Pin male connectors.

 Sound




Featuring AAW's advanced acoustic designs, Capri offers 24bit high resolution digital conversion. Balanced DAC/HPA offers differential audio signal with up to 128mw output power to feed the most demanding earphones. Carefully designed audio signal path and premium grade electronic components meet the most strict interference elimination requirement and keeps an ultra low output impedance. 

Specially designed for this campaign and backers without a detachable cable enabled IEM. The Capri UIEM (Universal In-Ear Monitor) is armed with 9.2mm Beryllium Physical Vapor Deposited diaphragm with Neodymium magnet micro-drivers. The PVD synthesised superconductive Beryllium thin film coating is able to achieve a thickness of 0.2 micron while maintaining excellent physical integrity and rigidness.  This translates to excellent transient response and extraordinary resolution. It is also equipped with 3 sets of inter-changeable gold/chromium plated brass nozzles, each with a unique sound signature to better suit your musical taste. For this campaign we only provide 2Pin option for Capri UIEM.
Prototypes of the Capri Universal In-Ear Monitor

Final color of Capri UIEM will be black + carbon faceplate
Now Fully Customizable!
Coming from a Custom In-Ear Monitor maker, what AAW does best is to make your earphone looks as fancy as it sounds. After consulting with Indiegogo and discussing with our tooling suppliers, we decided this will be our first stretch goal!

If no customization perk is chosen, default setup will be black shell/silver trim/CF faceplate.
 

 Versatility

For backers with existing branded IEMs, Capri digital cable offers 2Pin and MMCX. 2Pin connectors are in 0.78mm size,  MMCX on the other hand fits universal IEMs from most major brands. The angled design offers the most ergonomic cable entry angle for the best wearing experience. Capri is connected to iPhone 7/7 Plus via the Lightning connector and has retrospective compatibility up to iOS 7.2 and above. 

Users who wish to use connectors other than MMCX/2Pin please see FAQ section for details.
Capri cable prototype matched with AAW's custom in-ear creations:

 

 Cable

Both the analog and digital cables on Capri are constructed with 99.9997% purity OCC copper wires, supplied by our long time partner, cable specialist Null Audio. It is of excellent conductivity property and offer very low impedance to ensure obstruction free transportation of both the analog and digital signals. The digital cable connecting the Lightning connector and the control capsule is additionally shielded for maximum protection and to repel EMI interference. Leading into the IEM connector, Capri offers formable memory wire with over-the-ear configuration to keep a secure fit.
 

 Remote Control & Phone Call
Capri’s control capsule is equipped with a tri-button array, it mirrors the operation of a typical inline remote control with support of volume adjustment, next/previous tracks, answer/end phone call, call up Siri. Capri has high sensitivity microphone and 24bit/48kHz ADC circuitry built-in the control capsule and supports normal/conference phone calls, Siri or any iOS apps which utilise microphone functions. Noise filtering design ensures crystal clear call quality.
 

 iOS APP & MFI Approval


Capri is official MFI approved and utilised Apple’s authorised chipset and Lightning connectors. Its firmware is updatable through its matching iOS app. It is important that Capri’s functionality is uncompromised along with Apple’s future iOS development. Whenever Apple rolls out newer iOS update, Capri will remain in full force and 100% compatible with future protocol changes. 

 
 Android & Type-C Variant
Capri will be offered with Type-C variant for mainstream Android phones too. Type-C version will share exact hardware with its Lightning counterpart and support phone call and remote functions on mainstream Android phones. You will be offered a selection when you choose the perk.
 

 W900: World's First 9 Driver Hybrid CIEM
Developed and enhanced based on our acclaimed hybrid system, W900 is at the summit of our ideology of fusing the best traits out of dynamic and balanced armature drivers. Instead of creating high order RC crossover network, which usually causes chaotic phase shift and scrambled arrival timing, AAW uses a complete new approach called TrueXross to solve the classic coherence issue in hybrid earphones. The dynamic driver is proprietary tuned diaphragm wise and by further utilizing a physical low pass filter, it is to only function in minimal overlapping frequency range as opposed to the balanced armature driver. Coupled with delicate positional arrangement and front acoustic chamber design, AAW is able to achieve improved coherence, minimized phase shift and optimized arrival timing of music signal.

W900 is designed to be true reference equipment, it offers powerful yet natural sub bass which you will never find in a full balanced armature CIEM. The 4 way crossover network configures dedicated woofer, mid, treble and super tweeters. Inherited AAW's highly praised musical imaging, instrument separation and realistic sound stage, W900 steps up the game by offering extended treble and superior detail retrieval. The end result being a high-end speaker like performance condensed in a tiny footprint of CIEM.

AAW worked with the best balanced armature maker in the world to develop the bespoke super tweeter drivers used in W900. It ensures non-compromising sound pressure all the way up to 20kHz and further extends to 40kHz. 

Suitable for stage performers, recording studio, audio engineers and the most critical audiophiles. Every AAW custom is customised to fill exact cavity of your ears. The CIEM experience is started with a trip to audiologist to have ear impressions taken and AAW will carefully craft the monitor shells mirroring their shapes. Delicately tuned and matched transducers are then mounted into the shells to create a one of a kind earpiece for you and you only. Universal shape for W900 is also available.

 FAQ
1. How do I tell a Lightning audio device is authentic MFI approved?A. If you find your Lightning audio solution does not have one of the following traits: 1) three button array 2) capable to update firmware through iDevice 3) Flexible padding on the Lightning connector where it connects to iDevice, then regardless of its form factor, earphone, cable or adapter, it is probably hacked or fake (with exception to Apple’s own product). Moreover, phone call function is not mandatory on authentic accessories but fake solutions can’t realise this function anyway. So if your Lightning earphones have a nice remote control but unable to make phone calls, it is probably fake.
2. What would happen if a Lightning audio device is not MFI approved?A. It most likely uses a hacked chipset to communicate with iDevice. Any future iOS update may change protocol and rendering this device useless.
3. How do I know if my earphone has 2PIN or MMCX connector?A. Popular IEM with MMCX connector:

Shure SE215/315/425/535/846 
Ultimate Ears UE900/900S 
Westone W series, UM Pro series, ES series, AM Pro series

Popular IEM with 2PIN connector:

AAW CIEM lineup
Westone UM2 RC/UM3X RC/4R and all Westone CIEMs
Noble, 64 Audio, Empire Ears, Vision Ears, JH 2-pin series, Earsonics. 

most CIEM brands with 0.78mm socket size

4. What if my earphone's connector is neither 2 pin nor MMCX? Can I get customized modification service?A. Please contact authorised mod provider Null Audio to have Capri re-calibrated to 3rd party connectors and keep warranty intact. For the Indiegogo campaign, please contact us after you have backed the campaign, we will ship Capri to Null Audio in advance and have them shipped directly to you after the mod.
5. Do you have a list on supported models for modification?A. Please refer to the list below (non-exhaustive):

Ultimate Ears TF 10
Ultimate Ears CIEM
Sennheiser IE8/80
FitEar Custom Fit IEM
Etymotic ER4P/B/S
Audio Technica IM series, CK100Pro, E40/50/70 (A2DC connector)
Sony XBA A/Z series
If unsure, contact us.

6. Is Capri power-hungry?A. Capri consumes only less than 2% of the battery power per hour, therefore it is very power efficient. 
7. How long is Capri's warranty?A. One year parts & labor.
8. Is Capri digital cable powerful enough to drive my headphones?A. Capri should able to drive headphones up to 300ohm impedance. Do verify with your headphone manufacturer for compatibility.
9. Why balanced audio signal?A. It has been hotly debated in the audiophile community for decades, still we have seen it implemented in a slew of high end portable audio players. In a battery driven, low power scenario, we think it offers significant benefit in terms of noise reduction and power amplification. For working principle of balanced audio signal path, see this link.
10. I have Android phone with micro-USB port, can I use Capri?A. We have no plan to support micro-USB at the moment.
 
 Risks & Challenges
Supply Chain: Capri has utilised certain Apple supplied chipsets, which have long and sometime unpredictable lead-time and inventory. Information regarding lead-time is occasionally limited too. Most of Capri's tooling is done in-house by AAW, while minor but important bits such as some flexible parts are outsourced. Planning and control are serious tasks at hand.
Delivery: AAW has mature logistic department. However, we are accustomed to low volume/high value shipments such as custom in-ear monitors. With volume rises, AAW team strives to provide as efficient and timely shipping as possible. Shipping method wise, Singpost and FedEx are our long time partners. All shipments will be traceable and insured.
Customer Service: Similar to logistic, AAW's service team is excellent in handling various volume levels of high complexity service flow. Our staffs are well-trained and deep-knowledged about our products. They will step up and prove themselves to be capable of handling broader client base.
Quality Control: AAW is meticulous about our CIEM production and quality checks. We have accumulated much experience in large volume production as our Nebula and Q UIEM are picking up pace. Complete quality control process has been implemented with IQC, IPQC and PQC procedures in place, material or finished products will all go through multiple checks.

<h2><strong>Our Vision</strong></h2>
<p>Flipside is a new and extremely simple way to play console games. It's the least amount of hassle for the maximum amount of gaming bliss. There is NO reason to lug around consoles, tv's and bags full of gear anymore. Flipside proposes to be the fastest, lightest, full featured gaming controller on the market. One of the best things about the controller is it NEVER needs to be plugged in to charge. It immediately starts working using ambient light and can hold a charge for over 6 hours with no light. It works directly with your iPhone, iPad, Windows PC, Mac, and yes, EVEN Android games. Imagine what iPhone gaming would be like with a real controller. Apple, has been imagining the same thing. It's with great excitement that we are joining in with Apples vision for the next level of gaming. It all begins with the launch of iOS 7 this fall, and it gets exciting with the launch of the Flipside controller. But we need your help to speed up our production.</p>

<p>Every console had controllers with buttons. Transitioning to a touch screen had its many woes. Touch screen gaming has many limitations and only a few benefits.

Justice gave me my first freelance job about a year ago now, and I was happy to make the initial images but I admit deep down I considered this to be an ambitious, almost impossible task. But when I started seeing the real prototype images appearing in our shared dropbox folder, I knew this was going to be a reality. Justice is a meticulous, highly focused character and I am honoured to have been involved with Flipside in some small way. iPhone gaming is going to take more and more market share and Flipside will be right there to take advantage.""</span></p>

<h3><strong>What have we done so far?</strong></h3>
<p>The Flipside(TM) brain child was born in late 2011.  It came from a realization that, although the iPhone is a phenomenal device, gaming on it is not.  The need for a realistic controller for the iPhone was evident on my first attempt at ""NOVA 2."" Trying to play first person shooter games on a touch screen where your fingers are covering half the visual field is often maddening.  So, I decided that if I was going to create the ultimate gaming device that I was not going to compromise on anything.  I want it all! I started at the top. My list was long.  I wanted it to be bluetooth, have all the game buttons I need, including shoulder and trigger buttons, work with all the games I love, and definitely not fall apart in my hands.  Lastly, I wanted it to be TRULY wireless - never having to plug in to charge.  Thanks to solid state, thin film batteries and solar cells, it's all possible now.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""timeline for iphone flipside gaming controller case "" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/902539/pictures/full/20130630150655-timeline_finish.png?1372630018"" src="""" style="""" title=""Timeline""/></p>
<p>The next thing was to fine tune the design.  Through the work of a 3D modeler, we were able to ""see the future"" of the Flipside and use the designs to aid in the next step - building a prototype.  The first rough prototype for the case design was completed in summer 2012.  From there the work ramped up into high gear. The first electronics board was created, and we developed a working prototype. At that point we were confident that our idea would transform into reality.  Contacts were made with distribution companies, investors, and Apple, who gives their support!!  After research, knowing that the market has a place for us, that people have interest, and we would have IOS support has given us the momentum we need to push ahead with this exciting project.  In recent months we have hired an amazing Electrical Engineer to finish the electronics board and he is scaling it down to the final size of &lt;4mm off any surface after the overmolding is done. We're proud to say that ALL of the initial ""must haves"" will be included int his first production run  .Currently we are just working out minor kinks and setting up the production and distribution timeline for this based on certain ""milestones"" we acheive though this campaign. Here is where YOU come in!!</p>

<h2>Do I have to be a gamer to enjoy the Flipside case?</h2>
<p>No! The Flipside is a specially designed case with serious gaming controls added that, in addition to just being fun, can help good gamers get better, and great gamers just go nuts!  But, if you are like my wife, and play maybe one or two games a year, it is still a fully functional phone case that looks awesome and is a great conversations piece. As per my wife ""I can't wait to have one. Even though I'm not a big gamer, at least I know that when I am playing that it will be comfortable, and ergonomic. And hopefully it will eventually cause me to overtake my husband and son as king of the gamers!!!"" (note from ""the boss"" that will never happen, sorry babe)</p>

The fastest, lightest, hassle free gaming controller for your iOS, PC, Mac, or Tablet games. 
Why
Console Gaming should no longer be limited to ""at home play"". With advanced tablet graphics, massive game library's and the Flipside controller, an incredible gaming option is finally available to the masses. 
When
With proper funding we can be market ready in 6 months. iOS 7 launches this fall, giving a 4 month head start for developers for gaming compatibility. 
How
Using solid state thin film batteries, solar charging, and Bluetooth 4's low energy profile we can make a light, thin, overmolded plastic case for the iPhone or any mobile device that houses the controls we need for gaming. 
Where
This is the best part. Anywhere. Real games, real fun, real easy.
 
 
Our Vision
Flipside is a new and extremely simple way to play console games. It's the least amount of hassle for the maximum amount of gaming bliss. There is NO reason to lug around consoles, tv's and bags full of gear anymore. Flipside proposes to be the fastest, lightest, full featured gaming controller on the market. One of the best things about the controller is it NEVER needs to be plugged in to charge. It immediately starts working using ambient light and can hold a charge for over 6 hours with no light. It works directly with your iPhone, iPad, Windows PC, Mac, and yes, EVEN Android games. Imagine what iPhone gaming would be like with a real controller. Apple, has been imagining the same thing. It's with great excitement that we are joining in with Apples vision for the next level of gaming. It all begins with the launch of iOS 7 this fall, and it gets exciting with the launch of the Flipside controller. But we need your help to speed up our production.

The controller we are making is a dream device! 
Features
 
 * COMPLETELY WIRELESS 
 
This means not a single cable, not to plug it into the phone, or into the wall. With this          case you won't have to stop and think about what else you need to bring. 
 
 
 
* ULTRA FAST BLUETOOTH 4.0 LOW ENERGY
 
Besides being 16x faster than older Bluetooth, this means we will have the highest compatibiilty with any device supporting Bluetooth. (Bluetooth 4.0 required for optimal battery life) 
 
 
  * LIGHTWEIGHT 
 
By using the iPhone body for rigidity we are able to make a very solid very lightweight controller that wraps and protects your phone whle providing the most coveted functionality to your phone. True gaming controls. 
 
 
 

* SOLAR CHARGING
 
Solar charges inside and out faster than it depletes. Store your phone in your pocket? Not a problem, almost as soon as the case hits the light its ready to go. (think old school solar calculator) Dark place no light at all? The Flipside case holds over 5+ hrs of projected battery life and is usable while it charges. 
 
 
 
* A FULL SET OF GAMING CONTROLS
 
This is not just a game controller for your phone, but your computer games as well. So we have added a full set of gaming controls (triggers, dual analog controls, shoulder buttons) 
 
*  IOS 7 compatibility
Controllers are only useful if you have games to use them with. With iOS 7 adding a standard for gaming controllers we now have the BEST SOLUTION for game compatibility. No Hacks! This is OFFICIAL APPLE support. 
 
*  Customizable control pads
*  Open API for developer use
*  Looks beautiful on your iPhone 5
*  Will support future iPhone releases iPhone 5s/iPhone 6
 
And the best part is that we have a working prototype! This multifunctional device is already proving to be a serious ""game changer,"" so-to-speak in the gaming device community.  We wanted to give you the BEST.  Which is why this is such an exciting project to invest in. Join us in the beginning of the next generation of high-end gaming fun, but priced for REAL PEOPLE.

</div></div>","The Edge Desk System is the World's Best Desk for how we work today.  The All-in-One Desk, Chair and Easel comes fully assembled, folds to 6"" for easy storage, is incredibly comfortable, promotes good posture and allows for increased productivity/creativity at home, at work or on-the-go!  With more than 1,000 backers already in 27 countries, we want to help even more people fill their need for the best work/creative experience possible.  

  
Why The Edge?The way we work has changed. Your laptop (or smartphone) can do more than an entire office full of typists, phones, and fax machines. So, why are we working on static, bulky, cluttered desks?
That’s why The Edge is so important. Changing with the way we work, it provides a space to work anywhere, anytime.  The built-in chair naturally engages perfect posture and focus, making for a portable and positive work environment with a chic design discouraging clutter.

</div><div><strong> <br/>It is very easy to analyze a frequency. Such analysis promise more complex applications, but here it is more than just a frequency analysis and, as such, projects remain on paper.</strong></div><div>

Many Start-ups have created Electroencephalogram (EEG) headsets, but  not real applications hve resulted.It's always the same scenario: good hardware,plentiful publicity and some applications using the differents states of the brain (beta, alpha, theta and delta).
 It is very easy to analyze a frequency. Such analysis promise more complex applications, but here it is more than just a frequency analysis and, as such, projects remain on paper.
Many nice video, beautiful advertisings, many beautiful headsets EEG and sdk was created....

FOR EXAMPLE THAT................sorry

The market of EEG gadgets is a gold mine.


VERY GOOOD NEWS AFTER TEST WE FUND THE REAL GOOD HARDWARE
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/openbci/openbci-an-open-source-brain-computer-interface-fo


But :
can I write a text with my mind?NO!
Peoples with disabilities use it to improve theire lives? NO!
Can I play at call of duty with my brain? NO!
Current applications work on a simple principle, I focus or not
...like a button.. It's a beginning...
But, we need to
create a keyboard!!!!

But for this, we need you.The problem is that real eeg have many sensors.


Yes, this isn't very nice and the sensors must be a specific places, not approximate
I can't publish the picture of such a beautifully designed headsets because the pictures are copyrighted but just Google ""headset"".
A part of our work is testing commercial headsets and creating software for them. 
Another problem is all people have a different head morphology and the position of sensors is very important.


Our goals are:


Provide a real solution to analyze
and using EEG waves in real applications.
Determine where, and how many
electrodes are required for each specific use.
Creating specific systems for good
uses and adapted to the morphology of the user through 3D printing.
To provide those who do not have such
equipment, the best equipment at the best prices.

But
the first and real goal is softwares !!!!, we make  softwares for listen
to the brain not only to hear its noise.
Six months I did not even know crowdfunding existed. And a friend told me: 

""hey, look it take millions to make simple eeg headset and you don't
develop your project because you don't have such money ask in the world!!""
We did not wait for the creation of beautiful eeg headset. We have worked for
seven years in our ""garrage"" joke :-) for create a system that can
correctly interprets brain waves.
We are near the finish line,
BUT we need YOU.Potential uses:Medical :  

Neurofeedback
Treatment of anxiety, obsessive
compulsive disorder, depression...... (many studies uses EEG and
neurofeedback)
Treatement of TDAH
Classifications and intepretations of EEGs.
etc...


Technical :

Control any device with mind
Word recognition (like vocal
recognition)
Detecting the state of brain, stress,
meditation etc...
Gamming
etc.

 

At a few important moments in history, some discovery,one that people have been waiting for for a long time, suddenly emerges and gives us access to a new age. One that's going to be a revolution for the world.

Today many groups and organizations are starting in this race.

Thousands of applications are being generated.existed 

The next question is who will shake the big entreprises? Is it the control of applications with your mind?  Imagine the potential !
Thousands of software packages in hundred of domains. But, just imagine something other, something new.
We didn't offer you just a better system. We offer you a different system in its conception, distribution and concept.
Today we are at the dawn of a new era which will revolutionize many fields. Twelve years ago I started to get interested in neural networks and signal processing and their fabulous capacities to solve problems which nonheuristic mathematics cannot be solve. 

A
little story
Seven years ago a person I knew was constantly challenged by anxiety.
I knew that an eminent doctor was using neurofeedback to help patients. I wanted to help my friend, so I learned about this technique.
One publications for understanding neurofeedback is the Harvard Mental Health Letter.  http://www.isnr.net/index.cfm  (Search on: ""neurofeedback and autism"".)
I had in my possession an old EEG. By seeing the differences between the moments of calm and anguish on the EEG, we can recognize the premise of the crises.  My friend was able to take appropriate drugs before the crisis and with hard work, and learning to focus his brain, he was able stop some crises. With practice, we succeeded in improving his condition.
It's very difficult to recognise crisis on a EEG
But an idea appeared to me! 
An idea appeared to me!
I developed an application based on a network of neuron.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network
I developed an application based on a network of neurons.
He had learned  to recognize the premise of the crises.
This has become a project for me. During the last seven years, I developed a complex and refined system based on a system of analysis of signals by neural network.
I would like to thank all who help me. I was not alone. Many brilliant people in many organisations helped me when I was at an impasse. Many people and various software helped me to understand and create my system.
AND a particular thanks for my wife and my daughter. My wife supported my project and resulting investment of time and money.

A
simple explanation of our technology

Each signal emitted by one of the sensors is connected to an independent network.  The results of each one are treated by a new network thus forming a complex.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organizing_map

Currently the results are beyond my expectation: attenuations of unwanted noise, detection of the movements of the eyes, detection of certain words, etc.
While Google and Microsoft have created monster networks to win the race of image learning, our approach is very diffenent.
Our brain isn't only a big neural network! With neurobiology, we know that the brain is a collection of millions of sub-networks, each used as a tool for a particular use. 
It is on this idea that our system works.

 


A summary of our system.
We test the system with script character recogition and have 70% best results with a reduction of 80 % of time to find the result, relative to a standard ocr recognition.  (Don't know how to fix this one.  Sorry.) 
This approach is very effective.
A major feature of nnXbrain is the automatic creation of new dedicated networks when there is a need.



And
now we are a little international team with all skills for the success.
Wher are we now ? What remains to be done?A
lot of softwares for use our system is on the way.
For windows, linux and Apple

ThoughtMouse this first software is designed for move the mouse and clic on the
screen with the mind.

ThoughtMove analyze movements of the head (if you think I turn my head left: the screen
scrolls to the right etc...)


ThoughtWords can detect if
you think a word, (the software includes a learning system that sends
your data to our supercomputer, to allow your software to learn your
way of thinking about words.) 

nnXneurofeed
is dedicated to use in medical neurofeedback for personal use or for
practician.
nnXbrainUltimate
is a software for the developer for make everythink with acces to our
GPU server for make the neural network of their software.

All
are on the way and is waiting the supercomputer and our final learning
software.
For the
learing software we want to optimize the code for GPU CUDA server, and
create a global software with thousand script and sub-programs.WHY
WE ARE NOW IN INDIEGOGO ?REMEMBER many big
projects was started in a garage! but...Now we have lot of work
for transform a laboratory project to commercial product.The learning phase
requires a lot of computation time.With our PCs, we should have hundreds
of years of computation......
We need 30 Teraflops in single precision if we want to complete the
project in 2 years.
For this computing power we need a server which costs between 50,000
and 60,000 euros.
We need money for the development team, for the research of the better
hardware etc...
We believe that we obtain the sum of 150000 euros , in approximately 2
years we have a complet application to detect, words, movements,
symptoms of disease… and after we have an universal system.
The goal is to create one universel system for EEG recognition.

We want to create the future of
software, not just something that works a little bit .....
We must transform scripts in a
standalone program.
Through learning from our network we
can define the exact location of the sensor for each use.
Each person has a different cranial
morphology, our headset will be creeated with 3D printing for each
person with the right settings and of course with a wide range of
design.
We need to create software that will
exploit the neural network created for each discipline.


Many work, many time of develpment, big computer then... many money
it's life....And that's the reason why
we need YOU to end quickly.What you will receive in return
You will receive free end user applications and access to our supercomputer for adjust your applications.And other little thinks.
Remember, on a
crowdfunding site more than 1,000,000 dollars was collected for an EEG
headset, currently no software performs a real task, like real
game control, medical help etc...

Risks and challenges
Although being a challenge of size, i'm sure, we have a big part of the
solution, but we need you.
""Creativity
is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did
something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it,
they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while.
That's because they were able to connect experiences they've had and
synthesize new things.""Steve

<h2>So why do you I need to record my phone conversations? </h2>
<p>Ever had a phone-call where you’ve not had a pen and paper to write down the details? Or simply forgotten what you were just told? It happens to the best of us. There’s also the ever-common hands-free situation where you’ll be talking on your handsfree system on your car and get told something you really wish you could write down.</p>
<p>That’s why the <b>BlueCarbon ™</b> exists. Get told a key number?  The device has you covered. It’s like having a second memory, letting you focus on having a great conversation or simply having the piece of mind that you won’t miss anything.</p>
<p>Better yet, if you’re a professional, such as a reporter interviewing a source or an HR professional assessing a candidate, you don’t have to worry about missing key details. It’s right there, waiting to be backed up.</p>

<div><span><span><p>Ever try and record a VOIP call? It sucks. With <b>BlueCarbon ™</b> it’s a few seconds of work, and you’ll never think about it again. Most Macs now include internal Bluetooth connectivity and if your PC doesn’t have it, you can pick up a simple USB Bluetooth connector from most electronics stores.</p>
<p>No more awkward software packages or dongles. If a computer has Bluetooth, <b>BlueCarbon ™</b> will record the conversation. </p>

<h1><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bluewire™
story</a></h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Avi, the creator of the <b>BlueCarbon ™</b>. I’m not new
to the world of tech, and I’m not here to ask for your money to maybe create
something. I’m a real guy creating real products for real people, from
governments to police forces to Hollywood movies. </p>
<p>As a child I always loved the James Bond movies.  I was always a fan of the action, but my
favorite part was Desmond Llewelyn as Q. He’d create those insane doodads and
gadgets that would get the job done, and I wanted to be somebody who would be
both Bond and Q mashed up.</p>
<p>So, I devoted my life creating cool and useful gadgets
that sold mainly to government agencies and law enforcement personnel. I did
this for twenty years, creating everything from a wristwatch-attached 720p
camera to the camera glasses from the first Mission Impossible movie. I’m a
perfectionist – those glasses actually <i>worked</i>,
unlike many movie props that are simulated. My process was always centered
around taking things further than something “just working.” For example, the
watch would automatically adjust using an accelerometer to the position of the
wrist – so that you didn’t have to constantly flip the image to watch the
video.  </p>
<p>To put it bluntly, I don’t half-bake anything. I don’t
want anything I’ve created to be done before, or done better. It’s not about
winning, it’s about doing things right.</p>
<p>The idea for the Bluewire came to me from one of the
most common and least interesting parts of the job - phone calls.  I’d frantically take notes, I’d get a call and
have to search for a pen and paper, or I’d simply hope I’d remember. I didn’t
want to pay an external service to do so for me, as it was both a security risk
and a huge cost.</p>
<p>Naturally, I assumed I’d find it easy to create a
small, wireless recording device. It wasn’t. As a small company creating an
affordable, mass-market device, it took eight months to create the product
design, and another five to find a Qi antenna to fit inside it. We could have
easily created a large, bulky device - but that would have been the opposite of
our goals. We wanted it to be so portable that you’d always be able to have it
with you, with low power consumption and so simple that anyone who could use a
smartphone could use it. We wanted it to work for educators, for business
people, or for people simply saving calls.</p>
<p>The most telling moment for me during the Bluewire’s
development was totally outside of the development cycle. My friend, a
locksmith, constantly got calls for jobs. He’d receive them and hastily write
down things<i> while driving</i>. It wasn’t
safe, but to him it was necessary. “I have no choice. It’s all about providing
a service and making money.” </p>
<p>It’s a little dramatic to say that this made me want
to save the world, but as much as I want business people to have an easier time
referring back to their calls, there’s such a larger opportunity. There’re
countless service jobs where people are driving from place to place and
constantly having to write things down (which you might get wrong if you’re
also <i>driving</i>). They have to do this –
otherwise how can they keep up with the demand of incoming business <b>and</b> still make it to their next job?
Sitting with my friend, I knew I was already making the solution.</p>
<p>Looking at the market, our competition wasn’t fierce,
but the challenge was. It has taken us a year to
get the Bluewire™ to this point. We didn’t want to start the campaign until we
had a functional prototype with software that was approaching completion.
Otherwise we’d be letting you down. We don’t want this to be a little gadget
you use once. We want it to be both essential and invisible; something you rely
on every day and don’t have to worry about. </p>

<h2></h2></b><h2><span>Where Are We With The Development?</span></h2>
<p>As of today, we have finalized completely the electronics and PCB design of the Bluwire™. The hardware has been tested and is working. In plain English: we have the unit, it works well, and we are going to keep making it better. This isn’t a vaporware product; it’s a device that we use ourselves that we are going to take many more months to make even better. We’re perfectionists. You’re putting your money into a device that even in its current state some companies would ship.</p>
<p>Not us. We want it to be brilliant.</p>
<p>Okay, enough grandstanding. The Industrial design is complete, and most of the pictures you see above are real.  What you see is what you get  - but it’ll be much better after the tooling will be made  and the parts will be injected.</p>
<p>As far as the Firmware design goes, we are in the last stages of tweaking and improving it. By our anticipated delivery date of the Bluwire™ in July, we will have complete and fully tested stable product. Having great software to match great hardware is something that’s very, very important to us.</p>
<p>App Development is going well. We are working to improve our internal Android version, and have started on our iOS version. By delivery, we will have completed and fully tested a stable App design on both platforms.</p>Either way, the <b>BlueCarbon ™</b> headset will support remote firmware updates and upgrades. We are not going to simply release the product and forget about you; this is a device we want you to use, love and integrate into your life for a long time.<p><b></b></p>

<h1><b>Why choose <b>BlueCarbon ™</b>
over Recording apps</b></h1>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<p></p>
<p>A question we’re often asked is why we’re
better than any of the “free” recording apps out there for both smartphones and
VoIP. </p>
<p>To be blunt: <b><i>have you used any of them</i></b>?</p>
<p>On iOS, due to Apple’s rules, you use an app
that will call your phone<i> back</i> to
make the call, files are awkward-to-access, and very often don’t have great
call quality. They’re incredibly hard to use with a car’s hands-free system and
you’ll spend extra time fumbling around to make it work. The “free” options are
limited on how long you can record. If your call drops, you go through the
entire process again.</p>
<p>On Android, your options are less limited but
still lack in quality of recording and ease of use. Furthermore, you’re still
stuck with the limitations of your device’s memory.</p>
<p>VoIP recording solutions are either
horrendously expensive or immensely awkward, and in some cases record the
entire<i> sound coming out of your computer</i>,
including any notification noises. There are conversation-recording software
packages. They’re as expensive as the Bluewire, if not more so. </p>
<p>In some cases, the software also can’t record
both sides of the conversation. In all cases, it’s an absolute pain to do.</p>
<p>Beyond that, these applications cannot
compensate for the undeniable hardware limitations that all phone manufacturers
are implementing, which cause poor sound quality one side recording only and
other recording defects.</p>
<p>The level of quality control on these apps also
leads to some users finding their call isn’t recorded. </p>
<p>To be selfish for a second, we’re also making
Bluewire for ourselves. We can’t randomly lose our conversations. That’d annoy
us a lot. And it’d annoy you more after you bought the device.</p>
<p>That’s why Bluewire™ is a hardware solution
combined with software, enabling two-way recording to run seamlessly, reliably
and deliberately built <i>for
business-critical situations</i>. That sounds like jargon, but we started this
project with the quality goal to be for those who <b>can’t afford to lose a conversation.</b> By setting an insane quality
and reliability standard from the get-go, we wouldn’t let down even the most
casual user of the product. </p>
<p>We’re relying on the almost universal Bluetooth
standard, so that the Bluewire™ can record conversations using cellphones made
even 15 years ago. These older phones don’t have access to the Bluewire app, but
will still be able to record both sides of their conversation and store it on
the internal memory of the Bluewire™ headset. They’ll be waiting on the headset
until you plug it into a computer. </p>
<p>As Bluewire™ can connect to any Bluetooth
device, it enables any Bluetooth device to take advantage of two-way recording.
Any tablet, any PC, any Mac or any<i>thing</i>
that can make a call works with our device.</p>

<h1>THE RISK
AND CHALLENGES</h1>

<p></p>
<p>Our team of engineers is experienced team and has developed many
complex products in the last 20 years. Avi, our founder, spent two decades
creating devices for governments agencies and big-budget movies (Mission Impossible and
Miss Congeniality). For example, Avi invented video glasses for covert operation 19 years ago and built other miniaturized complex devices  like a watch with a 720p
camera built into it for a government that would intelligently switch position
for active monitoring of a situation. <b>He
did this eight years ago.</b> </p>
<p>Our engineers have extensive experience in hardware and software
design, and we have been developing Bluewire™ for around a year. Throughout the
course of R&amp;D, we have created several iterations of prototypes and have
continuously improved their functionality and quality. We actively refuse to
release something we’re not happy with.</p>
<p>We have a team of nine people working on the Bluewire™. </p>
<p>We understand that Indiegogo backers want their Bluewire™as soon
as possible, and on time, but quality control is at the top of the list. Even
though we are confident we can deliver on our deadline, there are always
unforeseen challenges, or small changes that could cause delays. We will
not, however, disappear or fail to answer your questions. We’re in this
together.</p>
<p>As we push the Bluewire™ toward the finish line, we will focus
on real-life testing to make sure we deliver the best product possible that <b>real people will use with ease. </b>We
don’t just see this as a cool tech product but as something that could make the
average person really, really happy.</p>
<p>We are dedicated to our timeline and Bluewire™’s quality, and
will keep you informed on the status of our the project’s progress on the first
of each month (at a minimum), and will continue to send further updates as we
have them. We are committed to being transparent and keeping Bluewire™ fans
and Indiegogo backers informed. </p>
<p>
We are far from new to manufacturing new and innovative hardware and software,
and have done so for the toughest, most mission-critical situations. We mean
that completely literally. </p>

<h2>Is It
Legal To Record Phone Conversations?</h2>
<p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(42, 42, 42); letter-spacing: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""></p>
<p>Somebody is going to ask, and we’re here to answer it as
simply and plainly as possible. We want Bluwire™ to be a device that people use
legally. </p>
<p>There are two primary laws concerning the recording audio.</p>
<p>One Party Consent Laws: This is federal law and the law in 38
states. You can record a phone call or conversation so long as you are a party
to the conversation. Furthermore, if you are not a party to the conversation, a
""one-party consent"" law will allow you to record the conversation or
phone call <b>so long as your source
consents and has full knowledge that the communication will be recorded.</b></p>
<p>Two Party Consent Laws: Twelve states require the consent of
every party to a phone call or conversation in order to make the recording
lawful <b>(California, Connecticut,
Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire,
Pennsylvania and Washington)</b>. Although they are referred to as
""two-party consent"" laws, consent must be obtained from every party
to a phone call or conversation if it involves more than two people. </p>
<p><b><u>In addition it is important to note a general
trend in privacy/legality in public</u></b></p>
<p>Privacy Expectation: Generally speaking, however, you will not
be liable for intrusion if you photograph or capture video of people in public
places, even if they have not consented to being recorded, because individuals
cannot have a reasonable expectation of privacy when in public. </p>

<p><b>How does Bluewire pair with other devices?</b></p>
<p>Bluewire™ acts as an independent device, such as your smartphone
or car Bluetooth system and connects to various devices accordingly. </p>
<p><b>How to listen to the recorded calls?</b></p>
<p>Bluewire™ can be used as a headset where playback is enabled via
the dedicated cellphone application. Alternatively, you may connect your
Bluewire™ device to your computer, via Bluetooth or USB, and listen using your
preferred video playback application.  </p>
<p><b>How long you can I record a voice memo on the <b>BlueCarbon ™</b>?</b></p>
<p>Five minutes.</p>
<p><b>** Why we made a five minutes voice memo limitation?</b></p>
<p>Recording audio without a person’s permission is almost always illegal.
Since the microphone is hidden inside the headset, it theoretically could be
used as a covert Audio recorder. There are definitive federal and state laws
prohibiting surreptitious recording and monitoring of audio
conversations. We want this to be use for your own personal memos and we
have created it to be used as such. We do not condone, support nor take any
responsibility for any of any functionality of the Bluwire™.</p>
<p><b>Please note: the five minute limitation is only on relating to
the voice-recording option. Normal call recording has no time limit.</b></p>

</div></div>","World's smartest Bluetooth headset call recorderIntroducing BlueCarbon ™  (Patented) is the easiest-to-use smartphone and
VOIP call recorder. With simple Bluetooth connectivity, it’s the ONLY
Bluetooth headset on the market that can record both sides of a smartphone or
VoIP conversation and store the recordings securely on the headset itself. it’ll record whatever conversation is passing through the phone; so if you’ve
already got a Bluetooth device you’re comfortable with,  BlueCarbon ™  can still record the
call and store the recordings on it's built-in memory, regardless of what Bluetooth device you’re going to use.


Record from any phone you own
Easy to Playback Recorded FilesAll of your calls are automatically saved on  BlueCarbon ™  and can be accessed through your  BlueCarbon ™  App.Send Files with a Single TapWhen you hang up, just tap your  BlueCarbon ™  to your phone, and that last call will be transferred and saved to your mobile device and sent to your email inbox.
Compatible with Any Headset on the Market



BlueCarbon™  Ivory Edition






As long as it’s paired with your phone and in range, whether you’re using the BlueCarbon ™ headset, another Bluetooth-enabled headset or device, or even your car’s hands-free system, Bluewire ™ will automatically record your conversations for you.




So why do you I need to record my phone conversations? 
Ever had a phone-call where you’ve not had a pen and paper to write down the details? Or simply forgotten what you were just told? It happens to the best of us. There’s also the ever-common hands-free situation where you’ll be talking on your handsfree system on your car and get told something you really wish you could write down.
That’s why the BlueCarbon ™ exists. Get told a key number?  The device has you covered. It’s like having a second memory, letting you focus on having a great conversation or simply having the piece of mind that you won’t miss anything.
Better yet, if you’re a professional, such as a reporter interviewing a source or an HR professional assessing a candidate, you don’t have to worry about missing key details. It’s right there, waiting to be backed up.
Record Skype or other VOIP Calls


Ever try and record a VOIP call? It sucks. With BlueCarbon ™ it’s a few seconds of work, and you’ll never think about it again. Most Macs now include internal Bluetooth connectivity and if your PC doesn’t have it, you can pick up a simple USB Bluetooth connector from most electronics stores.
No more awkward software packages or dongles. If a computer has Bluetooth, BlueCarbon ™ will record the conversation. 

Easy to Charge  Wirelessly through Qi Wireless Pad



If you don’t know what Qi charging is, it’s a standard that lets many phones and devices charge just by leaving it on the charger.
We want you to use BlueCarbon ™ as easily as possible, so we’ve integrated the Qi wireless antenna – not only is it a mark of true technological and design innovation, it makes your life just that much easier.
Additional FeaturesFind Your Keys With Just One Shake



With the BlueCarbon ™  comes with a ring to add it to your keys. This isn’t just to make sure you always have it with you.
With the BlueCarbon ™ App for iPhone (iOS) and Android, you can quickly find your keys around the home using the ""Find Bluewire™"" button. The  BlueCarbon ™  will then ring loudly, making it pretty obvious where you left your keys.
Alternately, if you’ve lost your phone you can shake the BlueCarbon ™- your phone will start ringing.

Use BlueCarbon™ as a Burglar Alarm with BlueGuard



Plus, there’s a built-in flashlight





Two way communications
Have a two way communication, ""walkie talkie""  between your phone and BlueCarbon™ (provided that you in a Bluetooth range)

















Prototypes 




BlueCarbon ™’ casing has
been in development for over seven months. The design has gone through more
than ten iterations to get a geometry and size that can fit all our complex
components as well as fitting neatly on your key-ring or in your pocket. We
also didn’t want to make something ugly.  
The electronics have also
been refined several times to achieve the lowest power consumption possible.




Patent NO.: US 9,167,086

Bluewire™
story
Hi, I’m Avi, the creator of the BlueCarbon ™. I’m not new
to the world of tech, and I’m not here to ask for your money to maybe create
something. I’m a real guy creating real products for real people, from
governments to police forces to Hollywood movies. 
As a child I always loved the James Bond movies.  I was always a fan of the action, but my
favorite part was Desmond Llewelyn as Q. He’d create those insane doodads and
gadgets that would get the job done, and I wanted to be somebody who would be
both Bond and Q mashed up.
So, I devoted my life creating cool and useful gadgets
that sold mainly to government agencies and law enforcement personnel. I did
this for twenty years, creating everything from a wristwatch-attached 720p
camera to the camera glasses from the first Mission Impossible movie. I’m a
perfectionist – those glasses actually worked,
unlike many movie props that are simulated. My process was always centered
around taking things further than something “just working.” For example, the
watch would automatically adjust using an accelerometer to the position of the
wrist – so that you didn’t have to constantly flip the image to watch the
video.  
To put it bluntly, I don’t half-bake anything. I don’t
want anything I’ve created to be done before, or done better. It’s not about
winning, it’s about doing things right.
The idea for the Bluewire came to me from one of the
most common and least interesting parts of the job - phone calls.  I’d frantically take notes, I’d get a call and
have to search for a pen and paper, or I’d simply hope I’d remember. I didn’t
want to pay an external service to do so for me, as it was both a security risk
and a huge cost.
Naturally, I assumed I’d find it easy to create a
small, wireless recording device. It wasn’t. As a small company creating an
affordable, mass-market device, it took eight months to create the product
design, and another five to find a Qi antenna to fit inside it. We could have
easily created a large, bulky device - but that would have been the opposite of
our goals. We wanted it to be so portable that you’d always be able to have it
with you, with low power consumption and so simple that anyone who could use a
smartphone could use it. We wanted it to work for educators, for business
people, or for people simply saving calls.
The most telling moment for me during the Bluewire’s
development was totally outside of the development cycle. My friend, a
locksmith, constantly got calls for jobs. He’d receive them and hastily write
down things while driving. It wasn’t
safe, but to him it was necessary. “I have no choice. It’s all about providing
a service and making money.” 
It’s a little dramatic to say that this made me want
to save the world, but as much as I want business people to have an easier time
referring back to their calls, there’s such a larger opportunity. There’re
countless service jobs where people are driving from place to place and
constantly having to write things down (which you might get wrong if you’re
also driving). They have to do this –
otherwise how can they keep up with the demand of incoming business and still make it to their next job?
Sitting with my friend, I knew I was already making the solution.
Looking at the market, our competition wasn’t fierce,
but the challenge was. It has taken us a year to
get the Bluewire™ to this point. We didn’t want to start the campaign until we
had a functional prototype with software that was approaching completion.
Otherwise we’d be letting you down. We don’t want this to be a little gadget
you use once. We want it to be both essential and invisible; something you rely
on every day and don’t have to worry about.

Where Are We With The Development?
As of today, we have finalized completely the electronics and PCB design of the Bluwire™. The hardware has been tested and is working. In plain English: we have the unit, it works well, and we are going to keep making it better. This isn’t a vaporware product; it’s a device that we use ourselves that we are going to take many more months to make even better. We’re perfectionists. You’re putting your money into a device that even in its current state some companies would ship.
Not us. We want it to be brilliant.
Okay, enough grandstanding. The Industrial design is complete, and most of the pictures you see above are real.  What you see is what you get  - but it’ll be much better after the tooling will be made  and the parts will be injected.
As far as the Firmware design goes, we are in the last stages of tweaking and improving it. By our anticipated delivery date of the Bluwire™ in July, we will have complete and fully tested stable product. Having great software to match great hardware is something that’s very, very important to us.
App Development is going well. We are working to improve our internal Android version, and have started on our iOS version. By delivery, we will have completed and fully tested a stable App design on both platforms.Either way, the BlueCarbon ™ headset will support remote firmware updates and upgrades. We are not going to simply release the product and forget about you; this is a device we want you to use, love and integrate into your life for a long time.






So What Do We Need The Money For?



· We want to further improve our app design. 
· We want to further refine our firmware.
· Certifications - FCC, CE, Bluetooth
· Tooling and First production run



Why choose BlueCarbon ™
over Recording apps


A question we’re often asked is why we’re
better than any of the “free” recording apps out there for both smartphones and
VoIP. 
To be blunt: have you used any of them?
On iOS, due to Apple’s rules, you use an app
that will call your phone back to
make the call, files are awkward-to-access, and very often don’t have great
call quality. They’re incredibly hard to use with a car’s hands-free system and
you’ll spend extra time fumbling around to make it work. The “free” options are
limited on how long you can record. If your call drops, you go through the
entire process again.
On Android, your options are less limited but
still lack in quality of recording and ease of use. Furthermore, you’re still
stuck with the limitations of your device’s memory.
VoIP recording solutions are either
horrendously expensive or immensely awkward, and in some cases record the
entire sound coming out of your computer,
including any notification noises. There are conversation-recording software
packages. They’re as expensive as the Bluewire, if not more so. 
In some cases, the software also can’t record
both sides of the conversation. In all cases, it’s an absolute pain to do.
Beyond that, these applications cannot
compensate for the undeniable hardware limitations that all phone manufacturers
are implementing, which cause poor sound quality one side recording only and
other recording defects.
The level of quality control on these apps also
leads to some users finding their call isn’t recorded. 
To be selfish for a second, we’re also making
Bluewire for ourselves. We can’t randomly lose our conversations. That’d annoy
us a lot. And it’d annoy you more after you bought the device.
That’s why Bluewire™ is a hardware solution
combined with software, enabling two-way recording to run seamlessly, reliably
and deliberately built for
business-critical situations. That sounds like jargon, but we started this
project with the quality goal to be for those who can’t afford to lose a conversation. By setting an insane quality
and reliability standard from the get-go, we wouldn’t let down even the most
casual user of the product. 
We’re relying on the almost universal Bluetooth
standard, so that the Bluewire™ can record conversations using cellphones made
even 15 years ago. These older phones don’t have access to the Bluewire app, but
will still be able to record both sides of their conversation and store it on
the internal memory of the Bluewire™ headset. They’ll be waiting on the headset
until you plug it into a computer. 
As Bluewire™ can connect to any Bluetooth
device, it enables any Bluetooth device to take advantage of two-way recording.
Any tablet, any PC, any Mac or anything
that can make a call works with our device.






THE RISK
AND CHALLENGES


Our team of engineers is experienced team and has developed many
complex products in the last 20 years. Avi, our founder, spent two decades
creating devices for governments agencies and big-budget movies (Mission Impossible and
Miss Congeniality). For example, Avi invented video glasses for covert operation 19 years ago and built other miniaturized complex devices  like a watch with a 720p
camera built into it for a government that would intelligently switch position
for active monitoring of a situation. He
did this eight years ago. 
Our engineers have extensive experience in hardware and software
design, and we have been developing Bluewire™ for around a year. Throughout the
course of R&D, we have created several iterations of prototypes and have
continuously improved their functionality and quality. We actively refuse to
release something we’re not happy with.
We have a team of nine people working on the Bluewire™. 
We understand that Indiegogo backers want their Bluewire™as soon
as possible, and on time, but quality control is at the top of the list. Even
though we are confident we can deliver on our deadline, there are always
unforeseen challenges, or small changes that could cause delays. We will
not, however, disappear or fail to answer your questions. We’re in this
together.
As we push the Bluewire™ toward the finish line, we will focus
on real-life testing to make sure we deliver the best product possible that real people will use with ease. We
don’t just see this as a cool tech product but as something that could make the
average person really, really happy.
We are dedicated to our timeline and Bluewire™’s quality, and
will keep you informed on the status of our the project’s progress on the first
of each month (at a minimum), and will continue to send further updates as we
have them. We are committed to being transparent and keeping Bluewire™ fans
and Indiegogo backers informed. 

We are far from new to manufacturing new and innovative hardware and software,
and have done so for the toughest, most mission-critical situations. We mean
that completely literally. 


Is It
Legal To Record Phone Conversations?

Somebody is going to ask, and we’re here to answer it as
simply and plainly as possible. We want Bluwire™ to be a device that people use
legally. 
There are two primary laws concerning the recording audio.
One Party Consent Laws: This is federal law and the law in 38
states. You can record a phone call or conversation so long as you are a party
to the conversation. Furthermore, if you are not a party to the conversation, a
""one-party consent"" law will allow you to record the conversation or
phone call so long as your source
consents and has full knowledge that the communication will be recorded.
Two Party Consent Laws: Twelve states require the consent of
every party to a phone call or conversation in order to make the recording
lawful (California, Connecticut,
Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire,
Pennsylvania and Washington). Although they are referred to as
""two-party consent"" laws, consent must be obtained from every party
to a phone call or conversation if it involves more than two people. 
In addition it is important to note a general
trend in privacy/legality in public
Privacy Expectation: Generally speaking, however, you will not
be liable for intrusion if you photograph or capture video of people in public
places, even if they have not consented to being recorded, because individuals
cannot have a reasonable expectation of privacy when in public.

What Bluetooth Profiles Does BlueCarbon ™ use?
Connectivity 
• Wireless Technology: Bluetooth 
• Supports Bluetooth™ for wireless connectivity 
• Supports Bluetooth® version 4.0 
• AVRCP: This device
does not support AVRCP, meaning you cannot control your music directly from the
device.

can play music from a source, such as a smartphone, Bluetooth enabled laptop or
tablet. 
• Charging Interface:
Micro USB, Qi wireless charging
What is the recording capacity of a 16G Bluwire?
Up to 1,000 hours of recorded calls.
Where are the audio recordings stored?
Audio files (encrypted or not) are stored within Bluewire™’s
internal memory.
How does Bluewire pair with other devices?
Bluewire™ acts as an independent device, such as your smartphone
or car Bluetooth system and connects to various devices accordingly. 
How to listen to the recorded calls?
Bluewire™ can be used as a headset where playback is enabled via
the dedicated cellphone application. Alternatively, you may connect your
Bluewire™ device to your computer, via Bluetooth or USB, and listen using your
preferred video playback application.  
How long you can I record a voice memo on the BlueCarbon ™?
Five minutes.
** Why we made a five minutes voice memo limitation?
Recording audio without a person’s permission is almost always illegal.
Since the microphone is hidden inside the headset, it theoretically could be
used as a covert Audio recorder. There are definitive federal and state laws
prohibiting surreptitious recording and monitoring of audio
conversations. We want this to be use for your own personal memos and we
have created it to be used as such. We do not condone, support nor take any
responsibility for any of any functionality of the Bluwire™.
Please note: the five minute limitation is only on relating to
the voice-recording option. Normal call recording has no time limit.
Disclaimer: We are NOT lawyers, and the materials provided above
are informational and should not be relied upon as legal advice. If you are
concerned about using the Bluewire™ in a particular situation, seek legal advice

<h3><b>What is Pixelinvaders?</b></h3>PixelInvaders is an open-source hardware project for artists, geeks and YOU!</div><div>
<br/>The PixelInvaders LED system consists of 3D RGB LED panels, that are capable of playing back real-time generated video animations or simple color changes.<br/><br/>
</div><div>Multiple PixelInvader panels can be connected with each other to form a panel of any size. The panels are based on the latest LED technology - besides low heat dissipation and long life, a panel may illuminate an entire room and consume less energy than a standard lightbulb!<br/><br/>
</div><div>PixelInvaders panels are perfectly used as effect lighting in clubs, bars, fairs, museums, on stage, in a lobby or in your living room.<br/><br/>
</div><div>The control software ""<a href=""https://github.com/neophob/PixelController"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">PixelController</a>"" generates the video animation in real time. This has the advantage of video animations that are synchronized to music. PixelController is released as open-source project on GitHub.<br/><br/><h3><b>What are you using the money for?</b></h3>I'm running this Indiegogo crowd funding campaign to enable me to bulk purchase parts for at least 20 PixelInvaders DIY kits in order to offer you a great price. </div><div>

The PixelInvaders LED system consists of 3D RGB LED panels, that are capable of playing back real-time generated video animations or simple color changes.
Multiple PixelInvader panels can be connected with each other to form a panel of any size. The panels are based on the latest LED technology - besides low heat dissipation and long life, a panel may illuminate an entire room and consume less energy than a standard lightbulb!
PixelInvaders panels are perfectly used as effect lighting in clubs, bars, fairs, museums, on stage, in a lobby or in your living room.
The control software ""PixelController"" generates the video animation in real time. This has the advantage of video animations that are synchronized to music. PixelController is released as open-source project on GitHub.What are you using the money for?I'm running this Indiegogo crowd funding campaign to enable me to bulk purchase parts for at least 20 PixelInvaders DIY kits in order to offer you a great price. 
And after about 9 months of private alpha testing, I want a public beta test phase to get other ideas, to find bugs and maybe find one or more talented developer supporting me. Your pledge is what makes this project possible, I need your support!What do I need to use the PixelInvader panel?Besides a computer running OSX, Windows or Linux you need a 12V power supply and an Arduino compatible microcontroller board. I recommend a Teensy microcontroller board due to the performant serial throughput/latency. You may (re-)use an old ATX power supply as 12V power source.
What do I need to build the PixelInvader panel?You need some cables, a cutter, a drilling machine and plexiglas adhesive like Acrifix 116 or Ruderer L530. And of course time and patience.

How do I control a PixelInvaders panel?
By using the Open Source matrix controlling software ""PixelController"". I published the source on my GitHub site, some features:

17 video generators (plasma, images, blinkenlights movies...)

12 video effects (inverter, tint, rotozoom...)

12 video mixer (additive, multiplication, xor mixer...)

4 video fader (slide in, fader, switch)

Multi platform, tested on OSX, Windows and Linux

Beat/Snare/HiHat detection

The fronted is coded in PureData, this means you can control your PixelInvaders panels by using a Midi device (for example MPD26), an OSC application from your iPhone/Android Phone or tablet or by keyboard and mouse.

Control the PixelInvaders Panel by yourself or let the application handle that stuff depending on its environment.

<p>Phone Toaster is the world’s most feature-packed phone sanitizer. Make phone sterilization a daily habit by disinfecting effortlessly every time you charge your phone. Phone Toaster removes nearly all harmful bacteria and viruses swarming on your phone in just 5 minutes.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1597885680/pjpqsy4keupctw9v9wju.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Short answer: because your phone is filthy. Really filthy. A cell phone is typically ten times dirtier than a toilet seat. More than 17,000 bacterial gene copies may exist on your phone. Phones can also harbor bacteria and current deadly viruses as well like E.coli and Staphylococcus. </p>
<p>Sounds gross? Well, consider that you spend all day holding that dirt and disease in your hands or next to your face. No wonder acne and other infections can be traced to mobile phones.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1597885827/rwwhtx4ejtuxf5vfmi8z.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Because you bring it everywhere. In the subway. On the bus. To the gym. You eat with it. You sleep with it. And let's be honest — you bring it with you to the bathroom, too. It’s a big, dirty world out there, and your phone gets to experience ALL of it. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1597885901/fdbar73l61607emc2zpc.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>You should wash your hands six to ten times a day, so why not do the same with your phone? We designed Phone Toaster so phone sanitization becomes a daily habit, just like charging your phone — something you hardly need to think about. Phone Toaster’s sophisticated design also makes it perfect for any environment, be it your living room, your bedroom or even your office.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1597885950/lgfqulzmtquakuwutat2.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Phone Toaster is very effective at killing germs. Phone Toaster uses five powerful UV-C LEDs to kill nearly ALL harmful bacteria and viruses on your phone in just 5 minutes. Ultraviolet light between 200-280nm — called UV-C, or the ‘germicidal range’ — is proven to kill harmful bacteria like E. coli and Staphylococcus. It’s also proven effective against viruses like SARS and MERS, close relatives of the pandemic we're facing today, for which similar results can be expected, according to a factsheet published by the International Ultraviolet Association.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1597885985/afg3jeqih0agwwfmrpxy.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Phone Toaster uses a custom configuration of five LEDs inside a touchless light-proof enclosure to deliver germ and bacteria-destroying UV-C light to your phone’s entire surface, regardless of the make or model. There’s no need to flip your phone! In contrast, the majority of our competitors are only able to sanitize part of the phone at any one time. With Phone Toaster, you can always rest assured your phone will be “evenly toasted.”</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1597886056/l0e8mny6gro4fkwn3ip9.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Hey, aren’t UV-C rays harmful? Yes, they are. Which is why we painstakingly designed Phone Toaster to be perfectly safe. Its unique light-proof seal completely prevents harmful UV-C from escaping from the internal sanitizing and charging chamber. And its internal UV-C lights only operate when the device is completely closed. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1597886079/fuyiybvqftkhlausi2ne.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Sure, there are a ton of phone sanitizers on the market now. We think Phone Toaster eclipses the competition, however, with its full-phone coverage and safety-first design. Plus we look cool. </p>

</div></div>","Phone Toaster is the world’s most feature-packed phone sanitizer. Make phone sterilization a daily habit by disinfecting effortlessly every time you charge your phone. Phone Toaster removes nearly all harmful bacteria and viruses swarming on your phone in just 5 minutes.


Short answer: because your phone is filthy. Really filthy. A cell phone is typically ten times dirtier than a toilet seat. More than 17,000 bacterial gene copies may exist on your phone. Phones can also harbor bacteria and current deadly viruses as well like E.coli and Staphylococcus. 
Sounds gross? Well, consider that you spend all day holding that dirt and disease in your hands or next to your face. No wonder acne and other infections can be traced to mobile phones.

Because you bring it everywhere. In the subway. On the bus. To the gym. You eat with it. You sleep with it. And let's be honest — you bring it with you to the bathroom, too. It’s a big, dirty world out there, and your phone gets to experience ALL of it. 

You should wash your hands six to ten times a day, so why not do the same with your phone? We designed Phone Toaster so phone sanitization becomes a daily habit, just like charging your phone — something you hardly need to think about. Phone Toaster’s sophisticated design also makes it perfect for any environment, be it your living room, your bedroom or even your office.

Phone Toaster is very effective at killing germs. Phone Toaster uses five powerful UV-C LEDs to kill nearly ALL harmful bacteria and viruses on your phone in just 5 minutes. Ultraviolet light between 200-280nm — called UV-C, or the ‘germicidal range’ — is proven to kill harmful bacteria like E. coli and Staphylococcus. It’s also proven effective against viruses like SARS and MERS, close relatives of the pandemic we're facing today, for which similar results can be expected, according to a factsheet published by the International Ultraviolet Association.

Phone Toaster uses a custom configuration of five LEDs inside a touchless light-proof enclosure to deliver germ and bacteria-destroying UV-C light to your phone’s entire surface, regardless of the make or model. There’s no need to flip your phone! In contrast, the majority of our competitors are only able to sanitize part of the phone at any one time. With Phone Toaster, you can always rest assured your phone will be “evenly toasted.”

Hey, aren’t UV-C rays harmful? Yes, they are. Which is why we painstakingly designed Phone Toaster to be perfectly safe. Its unique light-proof seal completely prevents harmful UV-C from escaping from the internal sanitizing and charging chamber. And its internal UV-C lights only operate when the device is completely closed. 

Sure, there are a ton of phone sanitizers on the market now. We think Phone Toaster eclipses the competition, however, with its full-phone coverage and safety-first design. Plus we look cool. 

Every Phone Toaster order will include: 
- 1 Phone Toaster
- 1 power cable (110V - 240V)
- 1 power adapter with the proper plug and voltage for your country
- 1 manual (in English & Korean)


- Dimensions: 234mm x 155.5mm x 120mm (w/h/d)
- Weight: ~1.5 kg
- Max Phone Size: 80.8 x 172.3 x 11.9 mm
- Accommodates: iPhone11 Pro Max, Galaxy S20 Ultra and all smaller phones
- Power: 12V 2A (Max 30W) with included adapter
- Can Handle: 110V - 240V
- Casing: ABS, PC
- UV-C LEDs: 275nm (+/-10), at least 5 LEDs
- Wireless Charging: 9V 1.67A 15W Qi-compatible fast charging
- USB Charging: USB-A, 9V 1.67A 18W Fast Charging
- Bluetooth Speaker: 8W, Bluetooth version 5.1

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Why LocalJob?</strong></h2>
<p>The idea came from my personal experience of living in several different cities and being in the need of maintenance services for my apartment without having any established contact with local professionals. Another important factor was also the relatively high price usually asked for this kind of interventions; I felt the need to find a way to increase competition in the market and allow customers like me to compare prices and services offered.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What is the customer problem we will address?</strong></h2>
<p>The venture will address and solve the troubles related to finding reliable, fast and cheap technicians, who provide a spectrum of house maintenance services. The rating system and the auction mechanism will allow customers to find high-standard services at the lowest possible cost.</p>
<p>The app also meet the need for advertising of small enterprises and professionals, who can benefit of an easy and cheap way to promote their activities and gain visibility in their local area of interest.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Market segments</strong></h2>
<p>Given the bifocal nature of the venture, two are the main market segments. One is represented by young people (20-40), prone to use web-based services or mobile apps and open to new technologies, living in medium-to-big cities; the second consists in small enterprises and indipendent professionals, who operate in local markets and cannot afford extensive marketing and promotional strategies.</p>
<p>The initial launch phase will be limited to selected cities (Milan and Bologna in Italy), which provide the sufficient critical mass of users, combined with a predominating presence of a substrate of SME and professionals operating at a local and hyper-local level.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Who are your most relevant competitors?</strong></h2>
<p>Relevant competitors and substitutes for LocalJob can be classified into three main categories.</p>
<ul>
<li>Traditional advertisement, such as <em>Yellow Pages</em>, which are slower, less cost-efficient and with limited interactivity compared to LocalJob.</li>
<li>Web-based advertisement services, such as <em>craigslist.com </em>(or <em>subito.it</em>, <em>bakeka.it</em> <em>or Ebay Annunci</em> in the italian market targeted in the launch phase), which do not provide neither an integrated payment system nor a feedback-based valuation systems.</li>
<li>Other geolocalization-based social apps with advertisement components, such as <em>Foursquare</em>, which do not allow the bi-directional interaction provided by LocalJob (customers asking for interventions, professionals offering services and promoting their activities).</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<h2><strong>How will the venture make money? </strong></h2>
<p>LocalJob is based on two main revenue centers, a transaction fee on every transaction and the possibility to buy premium accounts.</p>
<ul>
<li>The transaction fee consists in either 3% of the transaction amount (if the payment is processed via the internal payment system) or a fixed fee of 3€ (in case of cash payments)</li>
<li>The premium accounts require the payment of a monthly fee, and offer to professionals more efficient advertising, greater visibility and a software for invoice management.</li>
</ul><p>Main costs are represented by software development costs, salaries for IT experts and marketing and promotion.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What are the three biggest risks for the venture?</strong></h2>
<p>The first critical risk for the venture is related to the fact that the apps needs an initial critical mass of users to be effective and useful. In fact, the service start being competitive compared to traditional methods only when a sufficient amount of costumers starts being involved in the network.</p>
<p>The second main risk is connected to the limited barriers to entry protecting the business from incumbent and new entrants, and to the possibility that established players in the <em>classified advertisement </em>market could jump on the opportunity with greater resources and platforms.</p>
<p>The third risk is represented by the considerable impact that phenomena like <em>black markets </em>and <em>shadow economy</em> have in the main target market (Italy). The established use of avoiding formal economy channels, especially in the market for professional services provision, could significantly hamper the development of a venture like LocalJob, that requires payment to be registered and formalized.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>The only thing this money will be used for pay the servers and we will handle all other costs ourselves too. We just want to hire two extra developers and hope that by doing some pre-sales here we will be able to delay having to raise funding, and maybe even prevent ever having to raise funding at all.</p>

The LABB: short for The Loopless And Buckleless Band. #welcometothefutureLESS IS MORE. The LABB’s strength lies in its apparent simplicity. No buckle, no loop, but a secure, hard-wearing, easy-to-use fastener. #smallbutstrong         The LABB is available in 5 different colors and 2 types of lugs (black and silver), a unique patented fastening system. Customising your Apple Watch with the LABB becomes a fun game.  Due to a lot of requests, we wanted to show you that black lugs with rose gold Apple Watch looks awesome too!  If you get two LABB you can start personalising your band by mixing colours depending on your mood.At Noomoon, we don’t « do » theory, we apply it. From purchase to use, it’s all about experience, with each new discovery becoming a part of who you are. So take a deep breath and get the Noomoon reflex! #noomoonwayoflifeThe strictiest tests from the industry have been made to make sure the LABB is safe.This amazing material called FKM can only be found on luxury watches nowadays. The cost is a lot higher than regular silicone or PU but it's totally worth it. At Noomoon, we speak a language full of acronyms and technical terms. The LABB is the perfect expression of the innovative, 100% Swiss material from which it’s made. A unique, future-proofed object – call it a UFO. – that is supple, soft to the touch, odourless, waterproof, resistant, smart and skin-friendly.  The LABB can currently only fit the 42mm Apple Watch! But depending on the success of the project, we might quickly adapt it the 38mm version of the Apple Watch. Also, it can fit wrists from 155mm to 220mm. In order to bring the LABB to life, we partnered with LAYER design studio, owned by the creative and multi-award wining designer, Benjamin Hubert.About a year ago we got an idea and felt we were on to something, but also realised the amount of work needed to accomplish it. Thanks to our amazing team and partners we are now reaching the final stage of development. Last but not least, we need your support to launch extra moulds and kick off the production!Noomoon is about dynamics and synergies pulling together. It’s about the hard core of individuals who built the brand, the boss who has faith in his employees, the designers who work on the products, the customers and fans who help pick out the colours and generally make their input felt. And the creative types who swear by nothing more than innovation and can’t wait to get onboard. Because creativity is always better when it’s shared. You are Noomoon.Want to write about NOOMOON and the LABB? Download our Press Pack (http://bit.ly/noomoon)! Any questions or concerns? Feel free to email us at press@noomoon.ch

<a name=""english"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">1.</a> Why Sports.ws Needs Your Help</h2><p>Hello general managers, as you may already know Sports.ws is owned and operated by one guy - me. Lately I find myself struggling to pay off the debt associated with the purchase of the website, with the revenue from advertisements barely covering costs associated with the site (server costs, stat licenses, etc.). I'm afraid that, without outside help, I'll have to look for work elsewhere - and that means less time and attention for Sports.ws.</p><p>With your help I can ensure that my financial situation doesn't hold me back and that Sports.ws remains my full-time priority. How can I prove I'm serious about this? If we meet the campaign goal, I'll even vow to develop an official Sports.ws app in time for the 2016-17 NBA season.</p><h3>A Sports.ws App? Really?</h3><p>Yes. For at least iOS and Android. So long as I am able to afford to give the time and labor required, I want Sports.ws to have an official app. If we reach this campaign goal, I'll be able continue to work on new Sports.ws features like this without having to waste my time dealing with new advertisers or looking for an alternative full-time job.</p><p>In addition to a Sports.ws app, if we meet this campaign goal, I can cut back on parts of our advertising campaigns to ensure a faster user experience on the website. Why? Because I won't need to pay off the original purchase.</p><p>Oh, and just for the fun of it, I'll give every user at Sports.ws advanced commissioner tools for the 2015-16 season.</p><h3>Individual Donor Perks</h3><p>Although everybody will benefit from the creation of an app and the aforementioned rewards, I've made unique perks available specifically to users who donate towards this Indiegogo campaign. Some are low key, some are pretty significant.</p><p>It would be a lifesaver for me personally if commissioners in Sports.ws keeper leagues tried to round up money from their owners. I wanted to set up perks that could benefit an entire group. If you donate as a group, you can secure some pretty substantial features.</p><p>If a league is able to top $1,000, for example, I want to let them design their very own default scoring method. That means every single league will have the option of using your scoring format, the same way that they do Standard or Production scoring.</p><h3>A Personal Letter From Austin Kent</h3><p>Hey Sports.ws GMs, my name is Austin Kent - I'm the one who has been running things around here for the past few years. I've proposed this Indiegogo campaign because I need your help.</p><p>Three years ago I bought the fantasy basketball site off of the original creator. It's been an honor to run Sports.ws ever since, but it's also been a challenge. You see, when I bought Sports.ws, I did so as an individual, not as a company or corporation. To be honest, the website has been on a line of credit for my wife and I ever since.</p><p>These days Sports.ws is barely able to cover its operating costs (servers, stat licenses, etc.) through our ad revenue and annual perk campaigns. The problem is that the debt associated with the original purchase has proven to be a concern and the attention required by the advertising campaigns to keep up with the ever-changing online ad industry takes up the majority of my Sports.ws time. </p><p>It has me wondering how much longer I'll be able to continue.</p><p>I don't want to have to advertise more than we already do, nor do anything that would more intrusively monetize the site. That being said, if I don't get a handle on this original purchase debt, there may come a time when I would have to walk away from Sports.ws altogether.</p><p>I love managing Sports.ws and being there when users need me. If we work toward this campaign goal together, I can guarantee that Sports.ws will always get the attention that it deserves.</p><hr/><h2>
<a name=""spanish"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">2.</a> ¿Por Sports.ws necesita tu ayuda?</h2><p>Hola gerentes generales, como usted ya sabe, Sports.ws es propiedad y está operado por un hombre - yo. Últimamente me encuentro luchando para pagar la deuda asociada a la compra del sitio web, con los ingresos de la publicidad apenas cubren los costos asociados con el sitio (costos de servidores, licencias de estadísticas, etc.). Me temo que, sin ayuda externa, voy a tener que buscar trabajo en otros lugares - y eso significa menos tiempo y atención por Sports.ws.</p><p>Con su ayuda puedo asegurar que mi situación económica no me detenga y que Sports.ws sigue siendo mi prioridad de tiempo completo. ¿Cómo puedo demostrar que soy serio sobre esto? Si nos encontramos con el objetivo de la campaña, yo incluso comprometo a desarrollar una aplicación oficial Sports.ws a tiempo para la temporada de 2016 a 17 de la NBA.</p><h3>Una aplicación Sports.ws? De Verdad?</h3><p>Sí. Durante al menos iOS y Android. Así que mientras yo sea capaz de permitirse el lujo de dar el tiempo y el trabajo necesarios, quiero Sports.ws tener una aplicación oficial.

<a name=""italian"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">3.</a> Perché Sports.ws ha bisogno del vostro aiuto</h2><p>Ciao General Manager, come forse già sapete Sports.ws è posseduto e gestito da una sola persona – me. </p><p>Ultimamente mi sono trovato in difficoltà nel saldare i debiti associati all’acquisto del sito web, con il guadagno proveniente dalle pubblicità che copre a mala pena le spese relative al sito (costi del server, licenze delle statistiche ecc.). </p><p>Temo che, senza un aiuto dall’esterno, dovrò cercare lavoro da un’altra parte – e questo significa meno tempo e attenzione per Sports.ws. </p><p>Con il vostro aiuto posso garantire che la mia situazione finanziaria non ostacolerà il mio impegno e che Sports.ws rimarrà la mia priorità a tempo pieno. </p><p>Come posso provare di essere serio riguardo a ciò? Se noi raggiungiamo l’obiettivo di questa iniziativa, io posso anche promettere di sviluppare una applicazione ufficiale di Sports.ws in tempo per la stagione NBA 2016-2017. </p><h3>Una app di Sports.ws? Veramente?</h3><p>Certo. Almeno per iOS e Android. Finchè sarò in grado di garantire il tempo e il lavoro necessari, vorrei che Sports.ws avesse una sua app ufficiale. </p><p>Se raggiungiamo l’obiettivo di questa iniziativa, io potrò continuare a lavorare su funzioni di Sports.ws come questa senza dover perdere il mio tempo con altre pubblicità o per cercare un altro lavoro a tempo pieno. </p><p>In aggiunta all’applicazione, se raggiungiamo l’obiettivo di questa iniziativa, potrò diminuire i banner pubblicitari per assicurare una navigazione più veloce sul sito. Perchè? Perché avrei una minore necessità di rientrare nei costi dell’acquisto originario di questo sito. </p><p>Oh, e solo per il gusto di farlo, darò ad ogni utente gli strumenti avanzati del Commissioner della stagione 2015-2016. </p><h3>Particolari vantaggi per i donatori</h3><p>Sebbene tutti usufruiranno della creazione di una app e dei benefici sopra menzionati, io creerò unici vantaggi disponibili solo agli utenti che doneranno per questa “Indiegogo Campaign”. Alcuni sono di poco conto, altri invece sono particolarmente significativi. </p><p>Personalmente per me sarebbe una benedizione se i Commissioner delle leghe keeper di Sports.ws raccogliessero donazioni dai loro owner. </p><p>Voglio creare vantaggi che possono dare un beneficio all’intero gruppo. Se donate come gruppo, potrete assicurarvi sostanziali e significative features. </p><p>Se una lega è in grado di raggiungere $1,000 per esempio, io lascerei ideare ai suoi utenti un proprio sistema di calcolo dei punteggi di default. </p><p>Questo significherebbe che ogni singola lega avrebbe la possibilità di scegliere il vostro scoring format, allo stesso modo in cui è possibile scegliere tra Standard o Production scoring. </p><h3>Una lettera personale da Austin Kent</h3><p>Hey GM di Sports.ws, il mio nome è Austin Kent, io sono colui che sta facendo funzionare le cose in questo sito negli ultimi anni. </p><p>Io ho proposto questa “Indiegogo campaign” perché ho bisogno del vostro aiuto.</p><p>Tre anni fa ho acquistato questo sito dal creatore originario.

<a name=""tagalog"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">4.</a> Bakit kailangan ng Sports.ws ang inyong tulong? </h2><p>Hello General Managers, para po sa kaalaman ng lahat, ang Sports.ws ay nasa pag-aari at ino-operate ng iisang tao - ako. Nitong mga nagdaang araw, ang inyong lingkod ay nagkakaproblema sa kung papaano mababayaran ang pagkakautang sa pagkaka-purchase nitong ating mahal na website. Ang kinikita po sa mga advertisements ay halos sumasapat lang sa mga bayarin ng website (such as server costs, stat licenses, etc.). Ang kinakatakot ko, kung wala akong matatanggap na tulong, baka kailanganin na maghanap ako ng panibagong trabaho/pagkakakitaan, na nangangahulugan ng kaunting oras at atensiyon ng inyong lingkod sa pag ooperate ng Sports.ws. </p><p>Sa pamamagitan ng inyong tulong, masisigurado ko sa inyo na hindi tayo maapektuhan ng aking financial situation, at mananatiling ang Sports.ws ang aking magiging priority. Sa katanuyan, kung ating mapagtutulungan na maabot itong ating campaign goal, ako po ay nangangako na magdedevelop ng Official Sports.ws app na magagamit natin sa 2016-17 NBA Season. </p><h3>Isang Sports.ws app? Seryoso? </h3><p>Opo, atleast sa IOS at Android. Hangga't kaya kong makapagbigay ng sapat na oras at paggawa, gusto kong magkaroon ng Sports.ws app. Kung maaabot natin ang ating campaign goal, maipagpapatuloy ko ang pag iimprove sa mga Sports.ws features nang hindi nag aaksaya ng oras sa pakikitungo sa mga bagong advertisers o sa paghahanap para sa isang alternatibong trabaho. </p><p>Bilang karagdagan sa Sports.ws app, kapag ating natugunan ang campaign goal, pwede kong putulin ang ibang mga advertising campaigns para mas mapabilis natin ang paggamit sa ating mahal na website. Bakit? Dahil hindi ko na kailangan pang bayaran ang pagkakapurchase ko sa ating website. </p><p>Oh, at para sa ikasisiya ng lahat, bibigyan ko ang lahat ng user ng Sports.ws advanced commissioner tools para sa 2015-16 season. </p><h3>Mga benepisyo para sa mga donor</h3><p>Kahit na ang lahat ng users/general managers ay makikinabang sa paggawa ng Sports.ws App at sa mga nabanggit na premyo, Gumawa ako ng mga ""Unique Perks"" partikular sa mga users na nagdonate o sumuporta sa Kampanyang Indiegogo na ito. Ang ilan ay low key, ang ilan ay medyo exciting at makabuluhan. </p><p>Ito ay magiging lifesaver sa akin kung ang lahat ng commissioners sa Sports.ws keeper leagues ay makikipagtulungan sa kanilang mga owners/GMs para makalikom ng pera. Gusto kong gumawa ng ""perks"" na magbebenefit sa inyong league/grupo. Kung magdodonate kayo as a group, masesecure niyo at maeenjoy ang ilang magagandang substantial features. </p><p>Kung halimbawang ang isang grupo ay makakalikom ng $1,000, gusto kong mabigyan sila ng priviledge na gumawa ng sarili nilang default scoring method.

Iminumungkahi ko ang Indiegogo Campaign dahil kailangan ko ng inyong tulong. </p><p>Tatlong taon na ang nakakaraan, binili ko ang fantasy basketball site na ito sa orihinal nitong creator. Isang karangalan ang pamamalakad ng Sports.ws simula noon, subalit naging isa din itong hamon. Para sa inyo pong kaalaman, binili ko ang Sports.ws bilang isang indibidwal, at hindi isang korporasyon o isang kumpanya. Sa totoo lang,ang website na ito ay naging isang linya ng pagkakautang sa akin at ng aking asawa. </p><p>Nitong mga nagdaang araw, ang Sports.ws ay bahagya nang nacocover ang operating costs ( servers, stat licenses, etc. ) sa tulong ng mga ad revenue at annual perk campaigns. Ang problema ay yung pagkakautang noong orihinal na nagmamay ari ang aking inaalala at ang kinakailangang atensyon ng mga advertising campaigns para lang makasabay sa malimit na pagbabago ng online ad industry, ang siyang kumokonsumo ng karamihan ng aking oras sa Sports.ws. </p><p>Na nagpapa-isip sa akin kung hanggang kailan kong kakayanin na ipagpatuloy pa ito. </p><p>Hindi ko nais na mag-advertise ng higit pa sa ginagawa namin ngayon, at hindi rin gumawa ng anumang bagay na mas makakapagbigay ng pera sa site. That being said, kung wala akong makakatulong sa pagbabayad ng pagkakautang noong orihinal na pagkakapurchase, maaaring dumating ang oras na iwanan ko na ang pagmamanage ng Sports.ws. </p><p>Mahal ko ang pamamahala sa Sports.ws at ang pagiging laging andiyan kapag ako ay kinakailangan ngmg users. Kung sama sama nating pagtutulungan na maabot ang campaign goal na ito, sinisiguro ko na ang Sports.ws ay palaging makakakuha ang atensiyon na nararapat. </p><h2>Mga Pakinabang</h2><p><u>2015-16 Forum Package</u></p><p>Donors na isangla ang halaga na ito ay makuha ang standard Forum at Daily Dubs pakete na magagamit sa pamamagitan ng taunang sumigla kampanya.</p><p><u>2015-16 Ad-Free Package</u></p><p>Ang mga gumagamit na maabot ang milestone na ito ay makuha ang 2015-16 ad-free package na naging magagamit bilang isang sumigla sa website.

1. Why Sports.ws Needs Your HelpHello general managers, as you may already know Sports.ws is owned and operated by one guy - me. Lately I find myself struggling to pay off the debt associated with the purchase of the website, with the revenue from advertisements barely covering costs associated with the site (server costs, stat licenses, etc.). I'm afraid that, without outside help, I'll have to look for work elsewhere - and that means less time and attention for Sports.ws.With your help I can ensure that my financial situation doesn't hold me back and that Sports.ws remains my full-time priority. How can I prove I'm serious about this? If we meet the campaign goal, I'll even vow to develop an official Sports.ws app in time for the 2016-17 NBA season.A Sports.ws App? Really?Yes. For at least iOS and Android. So long as I am able to afford to give the time and labor required, I want Sports.ws to have an official app. If we reach this campaign goal, I'll be able continue to work on new Sports.ws features like this without having to waste my time dealing with new advertisers or looking for an alternative full-time job.In addition to a Sports.ws app, if we meet this campaign goal, I can cut back on parts of our advertising campaigns to ensure a faster user experience on the website. Why? Because I won't need to pay off the original purchase.Oh, and just for the fun of it, I'll give every user at Sports.ws advanced commissioner tools for the 2015-16 season.Individual Donor PerksAlthough everybody will benefit from the creation of an app and the aforementioned rewards, I've made unique perks available specifically to users who donate towards this Indiegogo campaign. Some are low key, some are pretty significant.It would be a lifesaver for me personally if commissioners in Sports.ws keeper leagues tried to round up money from their owners. I wanted to set up perks that could benefit an entire group. If you donate as a group, you can secure some pretty substantial features.If a league is able to top $1,000, for example, I want to let them design their very own default scoring method. That means every single league will have the option of using your scoring format, the same way that they do Standard or Production scoring.A Personal Letter From Austin KentHey Sports.ws GMs, my name is Austin Kent - I'm the one who has been running things around here for the past few years. I've proposed this Indiegogo campaign because I need your help.Three years ago I bought the fantasy basketball site off of the original creator. It's been an honor to run Sports.ws ever since, but it's also been a challenge. You see, when I bought Sports.ws, I did so as an individual, not as a company or corporation. To be honest, the website has been on a line of credit for my wife and I ever since.These days Sports.ws is barely able to cover its operating costs (servers, stat licenses, etc.) through our ad revenue and annual perk campaigns. The problem is that the debt associated with the original purchase has proven to be a concern and the attention required by the advertising campaigns to keep up with the ever-changing online ad industry takes up the majority of my Sports.ws time. It has me wondering how much longer I'll be able to continue.I don't want to have to advertise more than we already do, nor do anything that would more intrusively monetize the site. That being said, if I don't get a handle on this original purchase debt, there may come a time when I would have to walk away from Sports.ws altogether.I love managing Sports.ws and being there when users need me. If we work toward this campaign goal together, I can guarantee that Sports.ws will always get the attention that it deserves.
2. ¿Por Sports.ws necesita tu ayuda?Hola gerentes generales, como usted ya sabe, Sports.ws es propiedad y está operado por un hombre - yo. Últimamente me encuentro luchando para pagar la deuda asociada a la compra del sitio web, con los ingresos de la publicidad apenas cubren los costos asociados con el sitio (costos de servidores, licencias de estadísticas, etc.). Me temo que, sin ayuda externa, voy a tener que buscar trabajo en otros lugares - y eso significa menos tiempo y atención por Sports.ws.Con su ayuda puedo asegurar que mi situación económica no me detenga y que Sports.ws sigue siendo mi prioridad de tiempo completo. ¿Cómo puedo demostrar que soy serio sobre esto? Si nos encontramos con el objetivo de la campaña, yo incluso comprometo a desarrollar una aplicación oficial Sports.ws a tiempo para la temporada de 2016 a 17 de la NBA.Una aplicación Sports.ws? De Verdad?Sí. Durante al menos iOS y Android. Así que mientras yo sea capaz de permitirse el lujo de dar el tiempo y el trabajo necesarios, quiero Sports.ws tener una aplicación oficial. Si llegamos a este objetivo de la campaña, voy a poder seguir trabajando en la nueva Sports.ws características como esta sin tener que perder el tiempo tratando con nuevos anunciantes o en busca de un trabajo a tiempo completo alternativo.Además de una aplicación Sports.ws, si cumplimos con este objetivo de la campaña, puedo recortar partes de nuestras campañas de publicidad para garantizar una experiencia de usuario más rápida en la página web. ¿Por qué? Porque no voy a necesitar para pagar la compra original.Ah, y sólo por el gusto de hacerlo, voy a dar a cada usuario en Sports.ws herramientas comisionado avanzada para la temporada 2015-16.Beneficios de los donantesAunque todo el mundo se beneficiará de la creación de una aplicación y los beneficios antes mencionados, he hecho ventajas únicas disponibles específicamente para usuarios que donan a esta campaña Indiegogo. Algunos son de bajo perfil, algunas son bastante significativos.Sería un salvavidas para mí personalmente si los comisionados en ligas keeper Sports.ws intentaron acorralar a dinero de sus propietarios.

Me he propuesto esta campaña Indiegogo porque necesito tu ayuda.Hace tres años me compré el sitio de baloncesto de fantasía fuera del creador original.

3. Perché Sports.ws ha bisogno del vostro aiutoCiao General Manager, come forse già sapete Sports.ws è posseduto e gestito da una sola persona – me. Ultimamente mi sono trovato in difficoltà nel saldare i debiti associati all’acquisto del sito web, con il guadagno proveniente dalle pubblicità che copre a mala pena le spese relative al sito (costi del server, licenze delle statistiche ecc.). Temo che, senza un aiuto dall’esterno, dovrò cercare lavoro da un’altra parte – e questo significa meno tempo e attenzione per Sports.ws. Con il vostro aiuto posso garantire che la mia situazione finanziaria non ostacolerà il mio impegno e che Sports.ws rimarrà la mia priorità a tempo pieno. Come posso provare di essere serio riguardo a ciò? Se noi raggiungiamo l’obiettivo di questa iniziativa, io posso anche promettere di sviluppare una applicazione ufficiale di Sports.ws in tempo per la stagione NBA 2016-2017. Una app di Sports.ws? Veramente?Certo. Almeno per iOS e Android. Finchè sarò in grado di garantire il tempo e il lavoro necessari, vorrei che Sports.ws avesse una sua app ufficiale. Se raggiungiamo l’obiettivo di questa iniziativa, io potrò continuare a lavorare su funzioni di Sports.ws come questa senza dover perdere il mio tempo con altre pubblicità o per cercare un altro lavoro a tempo pieno. In aggiunta all’applicazione, se raggiungiamo l’obiettivo di questa iniziativa, potrò diminuire i banner pubblicitari per assicurare una navigazione più veloce sul sito. Perchè? Perché avrei una minore necessità di rientrare nei costi dell’acquisto originario di questo sito. Oh, e solo per il gusto di farlo, darò ad ogni utente gli strumenti avanzati del Commissioner della stagione 2015-2016. Particolari vantaggi per i donatoriSebbene tutti usufruiranno della creazione di una app e dei benefici sopra menzionati, io creerò unici vantaggi disponibili solo agli utenti che doneranno per questa “Indiegogo Campaign”. Alcuni sono di poco conto, altri invece sono particolarmente significativi. Personalmente per me sarebbe una benedizione se i Commissioner delle leghe keeper di Sports.ws raccogliessero donazioni dai loro owner. Voglio creare vantaggi che possono dare un beneficio all’intero gruppo. Se donate come gruppo, potrete assicurarvi sostanziali e significative features. Se una lega è in grado di raggiungere $1,000 per esempio, io lascerei ideare ai suoi utenti un proprio sistema di calcolo dei punteggi di default. Questo significherebbe che ogni singola lega avrebbe la possibilità di scegliere il vostro scoring format, allo stesso modo in cui è possibile scegliere tra Standard o Production scoring. Una lettera personale da Austin KentHey GM di Sports.ws, il mio nome è Austin Kent, io sono colui che sta facendo funzionare le cose in questo sito negli ultimi anni. Io ho proposto questa “Indiegogo campaign” perché ho bisogno del vostro aiuto.Tre anni fa ho acquistato questo sito dal creatore originario. E’ stato un onore gestire Sports.ws da allora, ma è stata anche una sfida. Vedete, quando ho acquistato Sports.ws, io l’ho fatto come singolo, non come compagnia o corporation. Ad essere onesto, il sito è diventato una linea di credito per me e mia moglie da allora. In questi giorni Sports.ws è a mala pena in grado di coprire i suoi costi operativi (server, licenze per le statistiche) attraverso i nostri redditi pubblicitari e le nostre iniziative di donazione annuali. Il problema sta nel fatto che il debito associato all’acquisto originario si è rivelato sempre più motivo di preoccupazione e l’attenzione richiesta per le iniziative pubblicitarie necessarie a tenere il passo con la continua evoluzione del settore pubblicitario online sta occupando la maggior parte del mio tempo su Sports.ws. Mi sto chiedendo per quanto tempo sarò in grado di andare avanti. Non voglio dover pubblicizzare più di quanto già facciamo, né fare qualcosa che possa monetizzare intrusivamente il sito. Detto questo, se non riesco a gestire questo debito dell’acquisto originario, potrebbe arrivare il momento in cui dovrò allontanarmi definitivamente da Sports.ws. Amo gestire Sports.ws ed essere qui quando gli utenti hanno bisogno di me. Se lavoriamo all’obiettivo di quest’iniziativa insieme, posso garantire che Sports.ws avrà sempre l’attenzione che merita. Benefici2015-2016 Forum Package I donatori che si impegnano per questo importo riceveranno l’accesso ai pacchetti standard Forum e Daily Dubs disponibili attraverso la campagna annuale di donazione. 2015-2016 Ad-Free Package Gli utenti che raggiungono questo traguardo riceveranno il pacchetto 2015-16 senza pubblicità, disponibile come beneficio accessorio sul sito. Sfoglia il sito senza alcuna pubblicità e ottieni anche l'accesso ai nostri forum VIP e agli strumenti avanzati del Commissioner. Beta Access a Sports.ws Fino a quando non raggiungeremo l’obiettivo della nostra iniziativa, avrò bisogno di utenti che mi aiutino nello sviluppo dell’app. di Sport.ws. I donatori che raggiungono questo traguardo otterranno l’accesso alla app. iOS/Android non appena sarà disponibile. Questo vantaggio include il pacchetto Ad-Free. Two Pixelated Posters Non c’è veramente miglior modo per supportare il tuo fantasy team di esporre il poster a casa o in ufficio. Gli utenti che acquistano questo pacchetto potranno scegliere tra due poster, a differenza del singolo poster del pacchetto standard. Lo vuoi di due fantasy team? Lo vuoi di un fantasy team e della tua squadra NBA preferita? Contattaci. Lifetime Ad-Free Package I banner pubblicitari sono un male necessario, ancora, ma è possibile sbarazzarsi del tutto di loro raggiungendo questo traguardo. Non solo navigherai senza banner pubblicitari nel 2015-2016, ma potrai navigare senza pubblicità per tutto il tempo in cui avrai un account di Sports.ws. Questo pacchetto include l’accesso beta alla app. appena sarà disponibile. Immortalize a Sports.ws LegendAllo stesso modo in cui siti come Basketball Reference ti permettono di sponsorizzare i profili individuali dei giocatori, noi ti permetteremo di lasciare il tuo segno sulla pagina del profilo di un giocatore. A condizione che il tuo messaggio sia appropriato, ti daremo 250 caratteri per scrivere qualsiasi cosa, dal pubblicizzare il tuo profilo al vantarti per la tua percentuale di vittorie in carriera su Sports.ws. Rendi immortale una Leggenda di Sports.ws Barney Stinson…Kimmy Gibbler… A Pony... _________. Il raggiungimento di questo traguardo darà ai donatori la possibilità di decidere chi sarà la prossima leggenda di Sports.ws. Sei tu? Un cibernetico Stephon Marbury? Il tuo personaggio preferito dello show che tu e i tuoi compagni di lega citate sempre? Sentitevi liberi di riunire i vostri compagni di lega e di donare insieme per usufruire di questo vantaggio. Con questo benefit saranno disponibili l’accesso beta all’applicazione e il pacchetto 2015-16 senza pubblicità per 10 utenti. Design a New Scoring MethodAvete giocato nelle Standard e nelle Production league, ma forse nessuno dei due scoring format vi ha accattivato quanto il custom scoring che avete creato con i vostri amici. I donatori che raggiungono questo traguardo possono progettare un metodo di calclo che vivrà per sempre, accessibile a tutti coloro che giocano su Sports.ws. Sentitevi liberi di riunire i vostri compagni di lega e di donare insieme al fine di raggiungere questo traguardo. Con questo benefit saranno disponibili l’accesso beta all’applicazione e il pacchetto 2015-16 senza pubblicità per 20 utenti. Lifetime VIP Sports.WS Support Commissoner, riunite i vostri compagni di lega e donate insieme. Oltre al vantaggio di ideare un metodo di punteggio, mi renderò direttamente disponibile, 24/7, per assistervi riguardo a qualsiasi questione, da questioni connesse ad eventuali problemi tecnici a dispute riguardanti le transazioni del gioco, fino a quando possiederò e gestirò il sito. Potrete progettare il vostro metodo di punteggio e rendere immortale una leggenda di Sports.ws. Con questo benefit saranno disponibili l’accesso beta all'applicazione e il pacchetto senza pubblicità per sempre per 30 utenti. 
4. Bakit kailangan ng Sports.ws ang inyong tulong? Hello General Managers, para po sa kaalaman ng lahat, ang Sports.ws ay nasa pag-aari at ino-operate ng iisang tao - ako. Nitong mga nagdaang araw, ang inyong lingkod ay nagkakaproblema sa kung papaano mababayaran ang pagkakautang sa pagkaka-purchase nitong ating mahal na website. Ang kinikita po sa mga advertisements ay halos sumasapat lang sa mga bayarin ng website (such as server costs, stat licenses, etc.). Ang kinakatakot ko, kung wala akong matatanggap na tulong, baka kailanganin na maghanap ako ng panibagong trabaho/pagkakakitaan, na nangangahulugan ng kaunting oras at atensiyon ng inyong lingkod sa pag ooperate ng Sports.ws. Sa pamamagitan ng inyong tulong, masisigurado ko sa inyo na hindi tayo maapektuhan ng aking financial situation, at mananatiling ang Sports.ws ang aking magiging priority. Sa katanuyan, kung ating mapagtutulungan na maabot itong ating campaign goal, ako po ay nangangako na magdedevelop ng Official Sports.ws app na magagamit natin sa 2016-17 NBA Season. Isang Sports.ws app? Seryoso? Opo, atleast sa IOS at Android. Hangga't kaya kong makapagbigay ng sapat na oras at paggawa, gusto kong magkaroon ng Sports.ws app. Kung maaabot natin ang ating campaign goal, maipagpapatuloy ko ang pag iimprove sa mga Sports.ws features nang hindi nag aaksaya ng oras sa pakikitungo sa mga bagong advertisers o sa paghahanap para sa isang alternatibong trabaho. Bilang karagdagan sa Sports.ws app, kapag ating natugunan ang campaign goal, pwede kong putulin ang ibang mga advertising campaigns para mas mapabilis natin ang paggamit sa ating mahal na website. Bakit? Dahil hindi ko na kailangan pang bayaran ang pagkakapurchase ko sa ating website. Oh, at para sa ikasisiya ng lahat, bibigyan ko ang lahat ng user ng Sports.ws advanced commissioner tools para sa 2015-16 season. Mga benepisyo para sa mga donorKahit na ang lahat ng users/general managers ay makikinabang sa paggawa ng Sports.ws App at sa mga nabanggit na premyo, Gumawa ako ng mga ""Unique Perks"" partikular sa mga users na nagdonate o sumuporta sa Kampanyang Indiegogo na ito. Ang ilan ay low key, ang ilan ay medyo exciting at makabuluhan. Ito ay magiging lifesaver sa akin kung ang lahat ng commissioners sa Sports.ws keeper leagues ay makikipagtulungan sa kanilang mga owners/GMs para makalikom ng pera. Gusto kong gumawa ng ""perks"" na magbebenefit sa inyong league/grupo. Kung magdodonate kayo as a group, masesecure niyo at maeenjoy ang ilang magagandang substantial features. Kung halimbawang ang isang grupo ay makakalikom ng $1,000, gusto kong mabigyan sila ng priviledge na gumawa ng sarili nilang default scoring method. Ibig sabihin lang noon ay lahat ng league sa Sports.ws ay magkakaron ng option na magamit ang dinesign ninyong scoring format, katulad lang din ng pagpili sa Standard or Production scoring method. Isang personal na liham, mula kay Austin KentMagandang araw Sports.ws GMs, Ang aking pangalan ay Austin Kent - Ako ang siyang nagpapatakbo ng site na ito sa mga nakalipas na taon. Iminumungkahi ko ang Indiegogo Campaign dahil kailangan ko ng inyong tulong. Tatlong taon na ang nakakaraan, binili ko ang fantasy basketball site na ito sa orihinal nitong creator. Isang karangalan ang pamamalakad ng Sports.ws simula noon, subalit naging isa din itong hamon. Para sa inyo pong kaalaman, binili ko ang Sports.ws bilang isang indibidwal, at hindi isang korporasyon o isang kumpanya. Sa totoo lang,ang website na ito ay naging isang linya ng pagkakautang sa akin at ng aking asawa. Nitong mga nagdaang araw, ang Sports.ws ay bahagya nang nacocover ang operating costs ( servers, stat licenses, etc. ) sa tulong ng mga ad revenue at annual perk campaigns. Ang problema ay yung pagkakautang noong orihinal na nagmamay ari ang aking inaalala at ang kinakailangang atensyon ng mga advertising campaigns para lang makasabay sa malimit na pagbabago ng online ad industry, ang siyang kumokonsumo ng karamihan ng aking oras sa Sports.ws. Na nagpapa-isip sa akin kung hanggang kailan kong kakayanin na ipagpatuloy pa ito. Hindi ko nais na mag-advertise ng higit pa sa ginagawa namin ngayon, at hindi rin gumawa ng anumang bagay na mas makakapagbigay ng pera sa site. That being said, kung wala akong makakatulong sa pagbabayad ng pagkakautang noong orihinal na pagkakapurchase, maaaring dumating ang oras na iwanan ko na ang pagmamanage ng Sports.ws. Mahal ko ang pamamahala sa Sports.ws at ang pagiging laging andiyan kapag ako ay kinakailangan ngmg users. Kung sama sama nating pagtutulungan na maabot ang campaign goal na ito, sinisiguro ko na ang Sports.ws ay palaging makakakuha ang atensiyon na nararapat. Mga Pakinabang2015-16 Forum PackageDonors na isangla ang halaga na ito ay makuha ang standard Forum at Daily Dubs pakete na magagamit sa pamamagitan ng taunang sumigla kampanya.2015-16 Ad-Free PackageAng mga gumagamit na maabot ang milestone na ito ay makuha ang 2015-16 ad-free package na naging magagamit bilang isang sumigla sa website.

This technology is for your own
good. Well, it's for the good of all mankind, at least all of us who want to feel
safe paying for everything we need or want, without
the risk of identity theft or fraud.* 



I have partnered with Northern California inventor and
entrepreneur Frank E. Smith to bring you this ground-breaking product. Frank has patented his secure thumbprint technology, and he has incorporated
this into a revolutionary system: “GoPay” – the only secure payment system backed by thumbprint identification.*Please note: With the GoPay system, your personal and payment 
information, as well as your fingerprint, are NOT being placed or shared
 into any other system, company or organization.
Your fingerprint and card info are stored ONLY in your GoPay device, 
which is not connected to any other entity, ensuring your information 
remains secure for YOUR OWN use only.The GoPay system by Chameleon ID Inc. has the ability to store all the information
and identification from ANY OTHER CARD YOU USE in one convenient place - the GoPay 
device. This device stores all your card information in one place, 
completely securely, protected by the user's own fingerprint. You can even use the device to shop online from the user screen, more securely than any other mobile shopping method.Not only that, but the world is moving toward using credit cards that 
have microchips embedded within the card. European countries have 
implemented this exclusively, and the United States will soon be 
changing over to this technology as well. With the GoPay card, you are 
one step ahead because it has a microchip embedded into it.CreditCards.com states: ""If you've traveled overseas recently, you may have had a
moment when your magnetic stripe credit card didn't work. In places where most
credit cards are identified by microchip -- Europe, Asia, Canada, Mexico,
Brazil, to name a few -- relying on standard American magnetic-stripe cards can
be inconvenient.  It can also make you
more vulnerable to fraud.""  Source: http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/us-slowly-rolls-out-emv_chip-technology-1276.php PROTECT YOUR NEST EGG!As
you know, these are treacherous times for even the most careful individual
making payments with their credit and debit cards. The GoPay card and partner
device uses patented thumbprint technology*  to create a completely secure
environment for consumers, so they can feel good about swiping their card whenever
and wherever they need to, whether at a business, or with another person, using
a card swiping device on their cell phone.
What We Need 
We  have a manufacturer standing by, ready to begin the tooling and
creating of our prototype reader/writer device. We have the patented micro-chipped credit cards made and ready, so we are raising $350,000 in order to get the prototype device made. The design and technical specs are in place, so now need your help in order to begin manufacturing
the most secure Payment System in the world!
The GoPay System by Chameleon ID will allow only
you (and no one else) to shop with your credit or debit card! All of your
credit cards are stored electronically within the GoPay Device; you can leave
your physical cards at home and store them in a safe place.BE A ROCK STAR; Help us reach our goal, so we can create this device and bring our system to the world. You’ve seen the headlines, and by now you’re wondering
how consumers and retailers alike can secure their information and payment
systems against hackers:


‘Target data breach affects at least 70 million customers, online shopper’

“…Target said an investigation has found that the hackers
stole the personal information of at least 70 million customers, including
names, mailing addresses, telephone numbers and email addresses. Previously,
the No.3 U.S. retailer said the hackers stole data from 40 million credit and
debit cards…” (Chicago
Tribune)
'Hackers Steal Credit Card Data from
Neiman Marcus Customers'
“Luxury retailer Neiman Marcus announced that customers’ credit card data
may have been stolen in a hack similar to the Target security breach that
affected millions. On Jan. 1 the company found evidence that hackers had breached
its cyber-security.” [ABC News]
'Protecting Your Financial Accounts From
Hackers'
“Consumers are getting bombarded with news of cyber security attacks at
well-known retail stores such as Target and Neiman Marcus. They are concerned
about their personal information and are left to wonder what can be done to
protect themselves…” [LowCards.com]*Pay close attention to what Mr. Crapo says in the following video, particularly at  2:45*Of course the risk goes beyond the consumer to retailers as well, with the government's own Homeland Security warning retailers about sophisticated malware that potentially affected a large number of stores. 

By now you can see what the GoPay card  system can do for consumers; the convenience of making all your payments and purchases from ONE credit card, along with the added security of being protected by thumbprint identification, and the potential uses beyond those basic options.How It Works
When you feel like shopping, simply

<br/><h2>Risks and challenges</h2>One
 of the biggest challenges is the manufacturing process. Quality control
 will be at the top of the list and most important issue. There are many
 reasons why the manufacturer's cooperation will not be easy. We 
understand that Indiegogo backers want their product as soon as 
possible, but we are limited by factory's capabilities. In our 
experience, most pre-production samples still have a slight variation 
from the final mass produced unit.<br/><br/><h1>
	FAQs</h1>
<h4>
	What is it?</h4>
<p>
	Diamond Nano Shield Coat Clear is a glass protection treatment which provides an 
invisible, water repellent, non-stick barrier to protect the glass 
surface. It chemically bonds to the glass, so won't rub off, and 
protects against scale and/or salt damage, while making the surface 
extremely easy to clean.<br/>
	 </p>
<p>
	Works on ALL glass types, phone, tablet, , e.g., windows, pool fencing, shower screens, 
splashbacks, exterior glass doors, facades, balustrades, skylights, 
automotive windscreens and automotive windows.</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<h4>
	Does it work on ceramic tiles or grout?</h4>
<p>
	Diamond Nano Shield Coat  Clear will work on glazed ceramic tiles, and ceramic baths, 
basins and toilets (treat the toilet BEFORE you fill it with water) as 
it would on glass. The product will work on new grout for a limited 
time, but will wear off long before it will on glass. Diamond Nano Shield Coat Clear was
 specifically designed for glass.</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<h4>
	Can anyone apply it?</h4>
<p>
	Yes. Application is simple and instructions are included with each purchase.</p><br/><h4>
	Is it safe to use?</h4>
<p>
	Diamond Nano Shield Coat Clear is alcohol based, so safe to use.</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<h4>
	What is the coverage rate?</h4>
<p>
	Approximately 5ml per 4 Square Feet.</p>
<p>
	Diamond Nano Shield Clear 5 ml will protect approximately 4 square Ft of glass,

</p><p>
	 </p>
<h4>
	How long does it last?</h4>
<p>
	Depends upon the age of the surface and level of exposure to environmental conditions. Typically 2-3 years in most conditions.</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<h4>
	Does it work on other surfaces?</h4>
<p>
	work on plastics, ceramics, glass</p>
<h4>
	Will it leave a mark or stain the surface?</h4>
<p>
	No. The appearance and clarity of the glass will not change after treatment.</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<h4>
	Does the surface need to be cleaned prior to application?</h4>
<p>
	Yes. Surface preparation is important to obtain maximum effects. A 
special glass cleaner is available (Quartz-Clean) and cleaning 
instructions are provided with each purchase.</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<h4>
	What if the surface has already been marked or stained?</h4>
<p>
	If the glass is scale or salt damaged (cloudy appearance which will not
 clean off), the damaged areas will need to be repaired before Diamond Nano Shield Coat 
Clear can be applied.</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<h4>
	Is an aftercare program needed?</h4>
<p>
	Treated glass becomes easy to clean, NOT self cleaning. Regular wiping 
with a wet microfibre cloth is all you need. Avoid the use of harsh 
chemical cleaners on the glass or ceramic surfaces as this may reduce 
the lifetime of the product, and are not needed to clean the treated 
glass or ceramic surface.</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<h4>
	Will the coating crack, peel or discolour over time?</h4>
<p>
	No. Diamond Nano Shield Coat Clear chemically bonds to the glass, and is not affected 
by UV light or heat (up to 250°C) so will not crack or discolour over 
time.</p><p></p></div>","Diamond Nano Shield is a remarkable Super Science  in nanotechnology. It is a fluid

We believe that ""Diamond Nano Shield  Coating"" will change the
 world; empowering people to do things they never could before. It 
brings convenience into people's everyday lives. 
Risks and challengesOne
 of the biggest challenges is the manufacturing process. Quality control
 will be at the top of the list and most important issue. There are many
 reasons why the manufacturer's cooperation will not be easy. We 
understand that Indiegogo backers want their product as soon as 
possible, but we are limited by factory's capabilities. In our 
experience, most pre-production samples still have a slight variation 
from the final mass produced unit.
	FAQs

	What is it?

	Diamond Nano Shield Coat Clear is a glass protection treatment which provides an 
invisible, water repellent, non-stick barrier to protect the glass 
surface. It chemically bonds to the glass, so won't rub off, and 
protects against scale and/or salt damage, while making the surface 
extremely easy to clean.
	 

	Works on ALL glass types, phone, tablet, , e.g., windows, pool fencing, shower screens, 
splashbacks, exterior glass doors, facades, balustrades, skylights, 
automotive windscreens and automotive windows.

	 

	Does it work on ceramic tiles or grout?

	Diamond Nano Shield Coat  Clear will work on glazed ceramic tiles, and ceramic baths, 
basins and toilets (treat the toilet BEFORE you fill it with water) as 
it would on glass. The product will work on new grout for a limited 
time, but will wear off long before it will on glass. Diamond Nano Shield Coat Clear was
 specifically designed for glass.

	 

	Can anyone apply it?

	Yes. Application is simple and instructions are included with each purchase.
	Is it safe to use?

	Diamond Nano Shield Coat Clear is alcohol based, so safe to use.

	 

	What is the coverage rate?

	Approximately 5ml per 4 Square Feet.

	Diamond Nano Shield Clear 5 ml will protect approximately 4 square Ft of glass,


	 

	How long does it last?

	Depends upon the age of the surface and level of exposure to environmental conditions. Typically 2-3 years in most conditions.

	 

	Does it work on other surfaces?

	work on plastics, ceramics, glass

	Will it leave a mark or stain the surface?

	No. The appearance and clarity of the glass will not change after treatment.

	 

	Does the surface need to be cleaned prior to application?

	Yes. Surface preparation is important to obtain maximum effects. A 
special glass cleaner is available (Quartz-Clean) and cleaning 
instructions are provided with each purchase.

	 

	What if the surface has already been marked or stained?

	If the glass is scale or salt damaged (cloudy appearance which will not
 clean off), the damaged areas will need to be repaired before Diamond Nano Shield Coat 
Clear can be applied.

	 

	Is an aftercare program needed?

	Treated glass becomes easy to clean, NOT self cleaning. Regular wiping 
with a wet microfibre cloth is all you need. Avoid the use of harsh 
chemical cleaners on the glass or ceramic surfaces as this may reduce 
the lifetime of the product, and are not needed to clean the treated 
glass or ceramic surface.

	 

	Will the coating crack, peel or discolour over time?

	No. Diamond Nano Shield Coat Clear chemically bonds to the glass, and is not affected 
by UV light or heat (up to 250°C) so will not crack or discolour over 
time.",9.0,0,"2 Campaigns

“Since the beginning of my life, I had the need to destroy things because I had to know how they were built … how they worked. Every time I saw a lamp, a LED, a moving component a electronic device ... I had to disassemble it. The more machines and electronic components I destroyed, the more machines I would buy and tear apart.”
Marco progressed from the inside workings of toy trains and radios to laptops and phones – his attention shifted to connecting with and controlling the world around him, a lamp, a TV and even an airplane. HIRIS’ goal is to put in the hands of every person an instant but natural ability to control the world around them.
“Freedom is the idea behind the HIRIS philosophy. I want people to think about HIRIS as a new type of key, not as a wellness companion. Our lives are made up of several different tasks, HIRIS will help us manage these tasks with simple gestures.”

Smart devices have become the most popular and used electronic devices in our lives. We also love to carry our favorite musics and enjoy them during commuting, traveling, or even just while sitting back and relaxing in the sofa. So, why don't we deserve to have a Hi-Fi environment anytime and anywhere, just as easily as we use our smart devices? No heavy equipment, and no lousy cabling! 

The Ladybugs will give you the tiniest form factor but prime Hi-Fi listening experience, which your smart devices never do!








Bit-Perfect
No Up/Down Sampling by Software/Hardware!


Hints to enjoy the ""Bit-Perfect"" music:




Use lossless audio source. Consider the limited storage size of mobile device, 16Bit/48KHz, or 24Bit/96KHz FLAC files are highly recommended.


Use native 24Bit/96KHz player app like ""USB Audio Player PRO"" on Android, and ""FLAC Player"" on iOS.


Definitely use Ladybug1 for most popular CD format, or Ladybug2 for Hi-Res 24Bit/96KHz format. Most importantly, with our design, they provide high volume output, and just consume few power from the mobile devices.



Android Phone with app ""USB Audio Player PRO"":






iOS Device with app ""FLAC Player"" (Camera Connection Kit Needed): 






Windows/MAC/Linux:





Ladybugs spec in detail:





*DAC Highlight: 

  ESS Sabre ES9023






The higher input impedance of your headphone, the higher output voltage ES9023 delivered. Perfectly match with the premium headphones like Sennheiser's HD650, HD800, or Beyerdynamic's DT990, DT90, T1 etc.

The audio signal goes straight out of the DAC chip and into headphone or amplifier.  There is no DC voltage to remove from the output of ES9023, which guarantee not only the widest audio bandwidth, but also the excellent sound quality.


Patented Hyperstream(TM) architecture for Time Domain Jitter Eliminator.


112dB DNR/SNR


*Low Noise Design Highlight:


The ultra low noise low drop voltage regulator used: Ultra Low Noise (<30uVrms) from 10Hz to 100KHz. High power-supply rejection ration (>70dB) from 10Hz to 10MHz.
1-oz copper, 4-layer PCB design with star-routing methodology for power trace routing.
Low ESR capacitors used.
High precision resistors used.
Gold-plated 3.5mm audio jack used.
Aluminum case used, to provide better noise immunity.

<p>The idea for PANDOO goes back to 1999, when co-founder Michael Patellis conceived of a way to connect medical patients and providers online, while digitizing and centralizing medical records. At that time, the notion of “the cloud” was in its infancy, and Michael’s idea took a back seat on his list of priorities, but was never forgotten!</p>
<p>Michael spent the next 10 years on other projects, but continued to believe the world needed a better way to store, access, and use information and services online. In late 2012, he carefully adjusted his cloud platform
project with a new vision: to give people the ability to do everything they do on their computers in one place, on the cloud.</p>
<p>In March of 2013, Michael met George Delaportas, a talented enterprise IT architect, entrepreneur, and self-described “geek,” who immediately saw the potential to revolutionize people’s lives with the first-ever personal computer, on the cloud. So Pandoo TEK, the company behind PANDOO, was born!</p>
<p>Pandoo TEK incorporated in Vancouver, Canada, in June 2013. In addition to Michael and George, the company currently consists of an international team of five developers and two designers. Our backgrounds and talents are diverse, but we all have one thing in common: <i>""A belief that PANDOO will change the world by building a powerful cloud-based O/S that makes computing more affordable, accessible, and easy to use—for everyone""</i>.</p>

<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">You've got questions—we've got answers! Want to know even more about PANDOO? <a href=""mailto:contact@pandoo.cc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Contact us</a> with any questions that aren't covered in the FAQ.</p>
<p><b>Q: How is PANDOO different from other personalized web platforms?</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">A: PANDOO is the world’s first personal computer on the cloud. It functions as a virtual computer that runs its own web-based O/S where everything is on the cloud. Unlike other web dashboards, which are just shortcuts that lead to services and apps on other web pages or platforms, PANDOO provides a real web desktop where apps are being developed and run in one screen. PANDOO is also the only system that offers true personalization and multitasking.</p><p style=""font-weight: normal;""></p><p><b>Q: What is the difference between PANDOO and Google Chrome OS?</b></p><p>A: Chrome OS is a downloadable Linux kernel-based operating system designed to work primarily with web applications. The user interface is entirely based on the Google Chrome web browser and it's like a dashboard. All the apps are links or shortcuts to other pages. Finally, it's performance is highly dependent on the computer you have. PANDOO, on the other hand, is a non-downloadable web-based Ecosystem and Meta-O/S where apps, games and services are being coded, deployed and run. PANDOO provides a universal desktop, not a dashboard, that resembles the classic Windows/Mac/Linux desktops. Finally, PANDOO disengages the device resources and uses the merits of the cloud and the web.</p><p></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""><b>Q: Can I use the applications installed on my computer (such as MS Office) with PANDOO?</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">A: Currently, PANDOO supports only web-based apps. However, we are working hard with a large open source community in order to provide a unified mechanism that enables all native and downloadable apps, games, and services, on Windows, Mac and Linux, to operate seamlessly on PANDOO. For now, PANDOO enables integration with numerous cloud applications and office suites that are 100% compatible with MS Office—such as Zoho, Google Docs, and more.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""><b>Q: With PANDOO, can I continue to use all the cloud-based applications I already use, and access the data I already have stored on the cloud?</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">A: Absolutely! PANDOO makes the process of using your favorite apps and cloud storage services many times easier and more user-friendly by integrating them all in one browser window, using one secure login.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""><b>Q: Does PANDOO work on a smartphone or tablet? </b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">A: PANDOO operates regardless of the device since it lives on the cloud. Currently, PANDOO has limited functionality on smaller screens, but we are working hard to offer an amazing experience to mobile users.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""><b>Q: Can PANDOO be used with any web browser?</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">A: PANDOO can run on all major web browsers. It is 100% compatible with any device and its minimum requirements are less than that of a 10-year-old computer.</p>
<p><b>Q: Can I access any of my critical data on PANDOO even if I don't have the Internet?</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">A: You can access recent data without the Internet using PANDOO's temporary local cache. However, PANDOO offers a better experience if you have Internet access.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""><b>Q: Why are some of the perks not available immediately at campaign launch?</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">A: Because we need your support to make PANDOO a reality, it is still in the early alpha stage / demo phase. Perks that involve app development and early access to the PANDOO API and Integrated Development Environment won't be available until PANDOO is fully launched.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""><b>Q: When will a premium sponsored listing for development of an app in the PANDOO Marketplace be available if I purchase the Vendor perk?</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">A: A premium sponsored listing for development of an app in the PANDOO Marketplace will be available at Beta launch—less than a year from now, in March 2015.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""><b>Q: When will early access to the PANDOO API and Integrated Development Environment be available if I purchase the Developer or Builder perks?</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">A: Early access to the PANDOO API and Integrated Development Environment will be available after the Beta launch—approximately one year from now, in May 2015.</p><p style=""font-weight: normal;""></p><p><b>Q: What programming languages does PANDOO support for development?</b></p><p>A: PANDOO supports all server-side programming languages and JavaScript for client-side (browser) development. The concept behind PANDOO is that the diversity of the cloud technologies and programming languages should continue to extend and evolve while PANDOO silently and transparently unifies them into a seamless interface.</p><p></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""><b>Q: What are the possibilities for customizing my PANDOO interface and apps?</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">A: PANDOO is all about you. You can personalize your PANDOO desktop by customizing everything from sounds and music, to colors, skins, and FX. PANDOO's functionality is also personalized to the user, with a dynamic environment that adjusts buttons, images, window sizes, etc. to fit your activities and preferences.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""><b>Q: Can I share and work collaboratively on documents and files using PANDOO?</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">A: PANDOO is THE platform for managing, collaborating and sharing your work efficiently and securely. With PANDOO Cloud, which provides UNLIMITED space, and “PANDOO talk”, the unique Internet communicator of PANDOO, you can easily do your work any time of day regardless of your location or the device you use.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""><b>Q: How does PANDOO use the login and other data I provide? Is my information private and secure?</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">A: Unlike other web desktops, PANDOO enables users to choose the kind of information they share with PANDOO and/or others. PANDOO also has a “Swipe Everything” mechanism so that users can delete every piece of information. Finally, PANDOO stores information only temporarily. In contrast to all other systems that store every single piece of information on you, PANDOO uses only information on-demand and then discards any data when you finish your tasks. We are working hard to develop smart technologies so that you enjoy secure cloud computing. Your personal data has never been more
secure!</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""><b>Q: Is PANDOO free?</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">A: PANDOO is FREE—for everyone. However, PANDOO makes money from personal and highly targeted advertising. We also receive commissions from apps sold on the PANDOO Marketplace and fees from developers who want to register and develop apps on the PANDOO Platform.</p>

""Internet of Things (IoT), will become a $1.6 trillion market within four years"" - Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft.
""I don't need a hard disk in my computer if I can get to the server faster carrying around these non-connected computers is byzantine by comparison."" – Steve Jobs, Former CEO of Apple.



PANDOO in action!

PANDOO offers an intuitive and user-friendly web desktop. You can run unlimited apps at one time. On PANDOO, everything is just one click away.

Turn any web browser into your personal computer


Simply log in to PANDOO on any web browser, and get FREE access to a powerful desktop running on a cloud-based operating system that you personalize with all the apps, documents, settings, and web services you care most about—all in one place, with an easy-to-use, customizable interface.

Break free from your devices

With PANDOO, you’re no longer limited by devices or hardware. All you need is a web browser to access your own personal cloud computer, on any desktop or laptop computer, tablet, or smartphone. Whether you’re on the go, on a public computer, or sharing a device with friends and family, PANDOO gives you access to a fully functional, personalized operating system that securely stores and runs all your apps, documents, files, and web services on the cloud, providing unlimited processing power and storage.

The easiest way to do it all on the cloud

Other web-based dashboards simply aggregate shortcuts and links to other websites and platforms, leaving you with a mess of tabs and “back” buttons to navigate. With PANDOO, you get your favorite apps and web services—plus new ones you haven't even dreamed of—all integrated directly into the PANDOO desktop. Get everything you need, customized just the way you like it, running side-by-side in one window. That makes PANDOO more powerful, more personalized, and more fun to use than anything else out there.

A better world through equal access to technology

PANDOO believes that no person’s future
should be limited by a lack of access to computing technology. By turning any
Internet-connected device into a fully-functional personal computer, PANDOO makes it possible for schools, young people, and those living in economically-challenged areas to do more with less. That’s why we’re partnering with Computer Aid, a UK-based charity dedicated to reducing poverty by collecting IT equipment for distribution in hospitals, universities, schools and not-for-profit organizations in over 100 countries. Every Indiegogo donation at the “Philanthropist” level of $100 or more will be split 50/50 to help bring more computers to people who need them!

FAQ

Who is behind PANDOO?
The idea for PANDOO goes back to 1999, when co-founder Michael Patellis conceived of a way to connect medical patients and providers online, while digitizing and centralizing medical records. At that time, the notion of “the cloud” was in its infancy, and Michael’s idea took a back seat on his list of priorities, but was never forgotten!
Michael spent the next 10 years on other projects, but continued to believe the world needed a better way to store, access, and use information and services online. In late 2012, he carefully adjusted his cloud platform
project with a new vision: to give people the ability to do everything they do on their computers in one place, on the cloud.
In March of 2013, Michael met George Delaportas, a talented enterprise IT architect, entrepreneur, and self-described “geek,” who immediately saw the potential to revolutionize people’s lives with the first-ever personal computer, on the cloud. So Pandoo TEK, the company behind PANDOO, was born!
Pandoo TEK incorporated in Vancouver, Canada, in June 2013. In addition to Michael and George, the company currently consists of an international team of five developers and two designers. Our backgrounds and talents are diverse, but we all have one thing in common: ""A belief that PANDOO will change the world by building a powerful cloud-based O/S that makes computing more affordable, accessible, and easy to use—for everyone"".
Connect with us to spread the word!

                                                               
We are PANDOO. Nice to meet you!

Michael Patellis :: Founder, President, CEO, Treasurer.Michael was born in Greece and has lived in Canada since 1973. He has been a “serial entrepreneur” since 1985. Over the years, Michael has initiated, invested in and promoted numerous new ideas and companies in industries such as transportation and technology. For the past ten years, he has worked to
establish seaplane operations in Greece.

FAQ

Frequently Asked Questions
You've got questions—we've got answers! Want to know even more about PANDOO? Contact us with any questions that aren't covered in the FAQ.
Q: How is PANDOO different from other personalized web platforms?
A: PANDOO is the world’s first personal computer on the cloud. It functions as a virtual computer that runs its own web-based O/S where everything is on the cloud. Unlike other web dashboards, which are just shortcuts that lead to services and apps on other web pages or platforms, PANDOO provides a real web desktop where apps are being developed and run in one screen. PANDOO is also the only system that offers true personalization and multitasking.Q: What is the difference between PANDOO and Google Chrome OS?A: Chrome OS is a downloadable Linux kernel-based operating system designed to work primarily with web applications. The user interface is entirely based on the Google Chrome web browser and it's like a dashboard. All the apps are links or shortcuts to other pages. Finally, it's performance is highly dependent on the computer you have. PANDOO, on the other hand, is a non-downloadable web-based Ecosystem and Meta-O/S where apps, games and services are being coded, deployed and run. PANDOO provides a universal desktop, not a dashboard, that resembles the classic Windows/Mac/Linux desktops. Finally, PANDOO disengages the device resources and uses the merits of the cloud and the web.
Q: Can I use the applications installed on my computer (such as MS Office) with PANDOO?
A: Currently, PANDOO supports only web-based apps. However, we are working hard with a large open source community in order to provide a unified mechanism that enables all native and downloadable apps, games, and services, on Windows, Mac and Linux, to operate seamlessly on PANDOO. For now, PANDOO enables integration with numerous cloud applications and office suites that are 100% compatible with MS Office—such as Zoho, Google Docs, and more.
Q: With PANDOO, can I continue to use all the cloud-based applications I already use, and access the data I already have stored on the cloud?
A: Absolutely! PANDOO makes the process of using your favorite apps and cloud storage services many times easier and more user-friendly by integrating them all in one browser window, using one secure login.
Q: Does PANDOO work on a smartphone or tablet? 
A: PANDOO operates regardless of the device since it lives on the cloud. Currently, PANDOO has limited functionality on smaller screens, but we are working hard to offer an amazing experience to mobile users.
Q: Can PANDOO be used with any web browser?
A: PANDOO can run on all major web browsers. It is 100% compatible with any device and its minimum requirements are less than that of a 10-year-old computer.
Q: Can I access any of my critical data on PANDOO even if I don't have the Internet?
A: You can access recent data without the Internet using PANDOO's temporary local cache. However, PANDOO offers a better experience if you have Internet access.
Q: Why are some of the perks not available immediately at campaign launch?
A: Because we need your support to make PANDOO a reality, it is still in the early alpha stage / demo phase. Perks that involve app development and early access to the PANDOO API and Integrated Development Environment won't be available until PANDOO is fully launched.
Q: When will a premium sponsored listing for development of an app in the PANDOO Marketplace be available if I purchase the Vendor perk?
A: A premium sponsored listing for development of an app in the PANDOO Marketplace will be available at Beta launch—less than a year from now, in March 2015.
Q: When will early access to the PANDOO API and Integrated Development Environment be available if I purchase the Developer or Builder perks?
A: Early access to the PANDOO API and Integrated Development Environment will be available after the Beta launch—approximately one year from now, in May 2015.Q: What programming languages does PANDOO support for development?A: PANDOO supports all server-side programming languages and JavaScript for client-side (browser) development. The concept behind PANDOO is that the diversity of the cloud technologies and programming languages should continue to extend and evolve while PANDOO silently and transparently unifies them into a seamless interface.
Q: What are the possibilities for customizing my PANDOO interface and apps?
A: PANDOO is all about you. You can personalize your PANDOO desktop by customizing everything from sounds and music, to colors, skins, and FX. PANDOO's functionality is also personalized to the user, with a dynamic environment that adjusts buttons, images, window sizes, etc. to fit your activities and preferences.
Q: Can I share and work collaboratively on documents and files using PANDOO?
A: PANDOO is THE platform for managing, collaborating and sharing your work efficiently and securely. With PANDOO Cloud, which provides UNLIMITED space, and “PANDOO talk”, the unique Internet communicator of PANDOO, you can easily do your work any time of day regardless of your location or the device you use.
Q: How does PANDOO use the login and other data I provide? Is my information private and secure?
A: Unlike other web desktops, PANDOO enables users to choose the kind of information they share with PANDOO and/or others. PANDOO also has a “Swipe Everything” mechanism so that users can delete every piece of information. Finally, PANDOO stores information only temporarily. In contrast to all other systems that store every single piece of information on you, PANDOO uses only information on-demand and then discards any data when you finish your tasks. We are working hard to develop smart technologies so that you enjoy secure cloud computing. Your personal data has never been more
secure!
Q: Is PANDOO free?
A: PANDOO is FREE—for everyone. However, PANDOO makes money from personal and highly targeted advertising. We also receive commissions from apps sold on the PANDOO Marketplace and fees from developers who want to register and develop apps on the PANDOO Platform.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h3><strong>PROBLEM</strong></h3>
<p>Citizens who lose power because of a natural or man-made disaster, lose access to their normal electronic communications channels. Televisions and cable modems stop working. Often, the only communications devices left are battery-powered radios and mobile phones.</p>
<p>Also, the information that citizens need after an emergency is different than during normal times.</p>
<p>There needs to be a system that lets local government create instant hubs for the information citizens need after an emergency – accessible to the devices they have. Not Facebook, not Twitter, but an online place specifically created for collecting and distributing reliable information.</p>
<h3><strong>PRODUCT</strong></h3>
<p>I experienced this need myself last year after Hurricane Irene, so I created MarkerFlare, a web-app for creating local information hubs and optimized for smartphones. It provides citizens with the community-specific information they need during emergency events, adds mass notification via text, email and online posting, and collects official and citizen-contributed reports. It includes an automated routing mechanism for authorities so that they can fact-check and approve everything before it is publicly posted. The entire system can be accessed by citizens or managed by officials from any web device, even if that can only be a smartphone at a WiFi hotspot.<br/><br/>MarkerFlare fills a huge hole in the emergency information collection and distribution abilities of local governments and their citizens. It provides the capabilities of social media, but incorporates fact-verification processes critical to official communications.</p>
<h3><strong>WHERE WE ARE</strong></h3>
<p>The prototype has already gotten great reviews from emergency managers and they want to include MarkerFlare as one of their tools. But it needs some additional development and a very large test before it can be certified as ready. If MarkerFlare can sustain the load of the test, our region's largest emergency management agency has arranged a space for us in the data center of their hurricane-proof data center, which means instant credibility and the opportunity to really spread this product across the country. Getting to that point and launching for our first communities will take about $65,000.</p>
<h3><strong>HOW YOU CAN HELP</strong></h3>
<p>Unfortunately, I have already invested all that I can and have no more to go forward. Thus this campaign. The funds will let us augment system security and optimize performance, pay for better servers and hosting, reskin the software, conduct our benchmarking test – and pay to have all of the legal work done.  Completing all of this gets us to where we can actually turn the system on for a couple of early adopter towns. If we go over our target and get all the way to $125,000, we will be able to actually launch and operate the system for a year.</p>
<h3><strong>THE TEST EVENT AND PERKS</strong></h3>
<p>MarkerFlare is a necessary service that can help lots of communities, but it may not be the most thrilling sounding product ever. That’s why we came up with testing it by having an interactive story created by the noted science fiction/fantasy author, <a href=""http://genedoucette.me/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Gene Doucette"">Gene Doucette</a>. He’s going to create an amazing scenario, and then we’ll run our emergency management test of MarkerFlare as if that scenario is actually occurring.<br/><br/>For perks we are offering permanent recognition on the individual launch screens that appear for each community as well as bigger benefits like actually experiencing or helping to manage the test. For companies, we are offering the chance to be exclusive sponsors of the product for individual communities, states, or the whole country. It’s a corporate social responsibility opportunity like nothing before.</p>

It makes sure that everyone who needs to sign-off, does.</em></p>
<h3>
<br/><strong>WHY YOU SHOULD CARE </strong>
</h3>
<p>We see reports of towns that need this service every week. MarkerFlare isn't free, but we designed it from the start to be very inexpensive. Because of that, it's a perfect vehicle for companies to engage in true social responsibility. After we get going, companies of any size that now just talk about social responsibility will be able to prove their commitment, by sponsoring MarkerFlare for their state, area, or local communities. It's an overt way that they can do something good, by providing a benefit to citizens and local governments that really matters. Also, there needs to be a different way to do important things. There is no reason a service designed specifically to help people can't be built while keeping the profit motive in check. We want to benefit from what we are creating so that we can keep doing it, but there’s a difference between profiting and pillaging.</p>
<h3><strong>WHY WE NEED MARKERFLARE</strong></h3>
<p>The majority of broadcast and cable news channels focus on wide distribution of a narrow range of content. Even if they are accessible, they are not set up to gather or provide the kind of local information that citizens need to answer all of the questions that arise during an emergency. Neither news outlets, or local agencies can mobilize all of the eyeballs needed to collect detailed information from every place within an emergency-affected area, evaluate it, and then incorporate it into a digestible form. Only the on-location involvement of citizens can fill the gap.</p>
<h3>SOCIAL MEDIA AND TOWN WEBSITES AREN'T THE ANSWER</h3>
<p>Local government agencies in many communities have begun to use a combination of their own websites, Facebook, and Twitter to distribute local information online, understanding that smartphones and some tablets can still access the web wirelessly. <em>This approach might seem like the ‘Grail’ but it’s not.</em> Town websites are often hosted in the affected area and can easily become inaccessible, or the personnel needed to update them may have no way to connect.

Citizens who lose power because of a natural or man-made disaster, lose access to their normal electronic communications channels. Televisions and cable modems stop working. Often, the only communications devices left are battery-powered radios and mobile phones.
Also, the information that citizens need after an emergency is different than during normal times.
There needs to be a system that lets local government create instant hubs for the information citizens need after an emergency – accessible to the devices they have. Not Facebook, not Twitter, but an online place specifically created for collecting and distributing reliable information.
PRODUCT
I experienced this need myself last year after Hurricane Irene, so I created MarkerFlare, a web-app for creating local information hubs and optimized for smartphones. It provides citizens with the community-specific information they need during emergency events, adds mass notification via text, email and online posting, and collects official and citizen-contributed reports. It includes an automated routing mechanism for authorities so that they can fact-check and approve everything before it is publicly posted. The entire system can be accessed by citizens or managed by officials from any web device, even if that can only be a smartphone at a WiFi hotspot.MarkerFlare fills a huge hole in the emergency information collection and distribution abilities of local governments and their citizens. It provides the capabilities of social media, but incorporates fact-verification processes critical to official communications.
WHERE WE ARE
The prototype has already gotten great reviews from emergency managers and they want to include MarkerFlare as one of their tools. But it needs some additional development and a very large test before it can be certified as ready. If MarkerFlare can sustain the load of the test, our region's largest emergency management agency has arranged a space for us in the data center of their hurricane-proof data center, which means instant credibility and the opportunity to really spread this product across the country. Getting to that point and launching for our first communities will take about $65,000.
HOW YOU CAN HELP
Unfortunately, I have already invested all that I can and have no more to go forward. Thus this campaign. The funds will let us augment system security and optimize performance, pay for better servers and hosting, reskin the software, conduct our benchmarking test – and pay to have all of the legal work done.  Completing all of this gets us to where we can actually turn the system on for a couple of early adopter towns. If we go over our target and get all the way to $125,000, we will be able to actually launch and operate the system for a year.
THE TEST EVENT AND PERKS
MarkerFlare is a necessary service that can help lots of communities, but it may not be the most thrilling sounding product ever. That’s why we came up with testing it by having an interactive story created by the noted science fiction/fantasy author, Gene Doucette. He’s going to create an amazing scenario, and then we’ll run our emergency management test of MarkerFlare as if that scenario is actually occurring.For perks we are offering permanent recognition on the individual launch screens that appear for each community as well as bigger benefits like actually experiencing or helping to manage the test. For companies, we are offering the chance to be exclusive sponsors of the product for individual communities, states, or the whole country. It’s a corporate social responsibility opportunity like nothing before.
  Upper left: ONE TOWN, ONE SPONSOR - A sponsor's social responsibility splash screen, linkable to their own sub-site. Appears on launch if there is no active emergency, or anytime with the ""Sponsor"" button. Users receive obvious benefit and sponsors get an undiluted platform limited to one sponsor per town.Upper right: SECURE, SIMPLE MANAGEMENT - Only authorized users can see or access official tools. Extremely simple design lets Administrators operate all system functions with virtually no training needed. 
  Lower left: EVERY USER CAN CONTRIBUTE - Citizens can submit their own information, not just passively receive. They can provide the eyewitness detail necessary to provide a real understanding of any situation. A citizen-submitted bulletin is shown.Lower right: AUTOMATIC APPROVAL WORKFLOW - Local administrators can vet official and citizen-submitted bulletins for completeness, accuracy and benefit using a fully customized and automated routing process before anything is posted. It makes sure that everyone who needs to sign-off, does.

WHY YOU SHOULD CARE 

We see reports of towns that need this service every week. MarkerFlare isn't free, but we designed it from the start to be very inexpensive. Because of that, it's a perfect vehicle for companies to engage in true social responsibility. After we get going, companies of any size that now just talk about social responsibility will be able to prove their commitment, by sponsoring MarkerFlare for their state, area, or local communities. It's an overt way that they can do something good, by providing a benefit to citizens and local governments that really matters. Also, there needs to be a different way to do important things. There is no reason a service designed specifically to help people can't be built while keeping the profit motive in check. We want to benefit from what we are creating so that we can keep doing it, but there’s a difference between profiting and pillaging.
WHY WE NEED MARKERFLARE
The majority of broadcast and cable news channels focus on wide distribution of a narrow range of content. Even if they are accessible, they are not set up to gather or provide the kind of local information that citizens need to answer all of the questions that arise during an emergency. Neither news outlets, or local agencies can mobilize all of the eyeballs needed to collect detailed information from every place within an emergency-affected area, evaluate it, and then incorporate it into a digestible form. Only the on-location involvement of citizens can fill the gap.
SOCIAL MEDIA AND TOWN WEBSITES AREN'T THE ANSWER
Local government agencies in many communities have begun to use a combination of their own websites, Facebook, and Twitter to distribute local information online, understanding that smartphones and some tablets can still access the web wirelessly. This approach might seem like the ‘Grail’ but it’s not. Town websites are often hosted in the affected area and can easily become inaccessible, or the personnel needed to update them may have no way to connect. Facebook and Twitter are free and more robust, but because they are social media services they are open to a vast range of modern-day abuses, such as “trolling” and “flaming.”  They have also become so large that navigating through them for specific local emergency information is a daunting task.
When a citizen’s last powered communications device has ten minutes of battery-life remaining, using it to wade through advertisements, searching a giant municipal web site, or dodging requests to “Like” the latest dance video, are frustrations that no one should need to experience.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Imagine you could create, arrange and group notes online as you can do with your sticky notes on a whiteboard. This is Noo. This will be Noo, with your support. It will be a visually appealing, easy-to-use open-source note taking application. Implemented using latest HTML5 standards and supporting mobile devices, too.</p>
<p>I'm the co-founder of <a href=""http://www.mediabird.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mediabird</a> (famous for its <a href=""http://moodle.org/mod/data/view.php?d=13&amp;rid=2354&amp;filter=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Mediabird Moodle Integration"">Moodle integration</a>) and I've created web apps (such as <a href=""http://www.stream-docs.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""StreamDocs Document Review Tool"">StreamDocs</a>) for almost four years now - using various technologies from Java, PHP, jQuery, Grails, Google Web Toolkit, HTML5 etc. I am constantly getting emails what has happened to the Mediabird Moodle extension. With this project, I want to make it easy for students to prepare for exams by taking lecture notes, memorizing important facts from their notes and discussing topics in detail. By arranging sticky notes on a virtual white board.</p>
<p>From my exam preparations at university, I remember how important it is to keep notes organized and to collaborate with study mates to get better results. Providing the students with the right tools to do so, is my key motivation why I'm doing this. Now I need your financial support to work on this project.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Since I cannot charge for this open-source project and have no particular funding also, I rely on your financial support to be able to invest my time in this project. Fully funded, this project will cover my personal expenses for about three/four months which is the rough estimate of how long it will take me to implement everything.</p>
<p>What you will get is a well-documented, highly-scalable application that you can integrate into your own web app, deploy it onto your intranet or host in the cloud. The bigger perks include support as well as individual instructions on integration patterns.</p>
<p>If I don't reach the entire goal, I hope to be able to at least start this project and find other contributors and get it running (I'm using git)</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Noo will not only make it easier for you to manage your notes, collaborate on your notes and group these, with the legacy intuitive usability known from sticky notes on a whiteboard. Additionally, it will allow you to enrich your existing web app or mobile application with the ability to easily manage notes.</p>
<p>As with the open-sourced version of Mediabird, I am looking forward to all the community contributions and use cases of this tool.</p>
<p>Supporting this project, you will allow educators, teachers, students, business people, teams, volunteers and many many more to easily create, arrange and group notes online. This project is about making this visually appealing and easy-to-use. No list-based approach, but all graphical.</p>
<p>Since I am creating Noo open-source, other developers can not only participate, but also benefit from my work.</p>
<p>Once this is done, I am looking forward to Dropbox, Google Drive, Moodle, Google Apps and further integrations.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you're a Grails or jQuery developer, software architect, designer or someone who'd like to give me some feedback, please get in touch with me</p>
<p>And please share this pledge with your friends, colleagues or people that will be willing to support me! Thank you very much.</p>

<h3>About The New Alexandrian Library Project and The Assembly of the Sacred Wheel</h3>
<p>The New Alexandrian Library (NAL) will be a resource for those that believe in true freedom and equality for religious studies - a resource that includes all of the esoteric and non-mainstream (but growing!) religions - not just the the usual 3 or 4.  The NAL will make as much content (literature, periodicals, art...) available via the web the greates extent allowed by copyright law, etc.  - so it can be a true resource for ALL of those that can benefit from such a resource!</p>

The Assembly was incorporated in the state of Delaware in 1993 and was granted 501(c)(3) status by the IRS in 1995.</span></p>

</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; How We Would Like To Thank You For Your Support</h3>
<p>The total project construction cost is around $175,000 for the first phase.  To date, the Assembly of the Sacred Wheel (ASW) has raised $46,687 in direct donations (80% of that from ASW members.  We put our own money where our mouth is!) and $84,000 from fundraisers over the last 10 years. The land was donated by ASW members and is not counted in these figures.</p>
<h3>Urgent Help Needed Now</h3>
<p>We need a total of an additional $50,000 in the next 5 months, BUT RIGHT NOW, we are asking for immediate funds to cover the next construction payment of $12,500 by October 1, 2012. That means a deadline for this campaign of September 11, 2012 to let the funds clear.</p>
<p>And while we know you know this project is worthy of support all on its own, we have produced several products over the years to help fundraising and we would like to send you a selection fo them to say 'Thank You!"" for your support.  See the Perks!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The NAL will serve to support and advance serious academic study for new, non-mainstream, esoteric, 'living' religions that are most likely to be the guiding forces in guiding the Earth and Humans back to health and evolution of Spirit in the coming century. </p>
<p>Like the original Great Library of Alexandria, the schools of Qabala in medieval Spain, and the flourishing of magick that occurred in renaissance Italy, the diverse confluence of minds and resources would result in great leaps forward in theory and practice. The NAL will be one of the cornerstones (of many created by various groups across the globe we hope!) of a new magickal renaissance. The benefits of this growing network for future generations will be incalculable.</p>
<p>The content of the library will also be made available via internet to the greatest extent possible (respecting copyrights, etc.) to be a resource for the entire esoteric community.  The facility will evolve to meet accreditation criteria and serve as the library of record for formal esoteric religion studies at a variety of institutes of higher education.</p>
<p>The NAL will be located on 100 acres of Sacred Land at Seelie Court  - a third of which has been donated to the NAL project - in Georgetown, DE.  The facility will be accessible to visiting scholars and is serviced by Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. airports - while maintaining a wonderfully secluded atmosphere for serious study.</p>

<p>My name is James Ng – I’m a mechanical engineer that has
found passion in product design. After nearly 20 years of working in manufacturing, much of my work is now focused on product design. I am continuously striving to create products that help
people in their every day lives.</p>
<p>Variform is a collection of projects I have started with my
partner, Erin Hung. Our team hopes to launch products in various categories
ranging from smartphone camera lenses and photography accessories to Bluetooth enabled
camera remotes and personal training devices. We have a strong interest in lifestyle
innovation and hope to introduce fresh and novel products to the market.</p><p>
</p><h3><b>Why Indiegogo?</b></h3>
<p>I’ve come to Indiegogo to bring my ideas directly to the
public and I hope to help close the gap between product design and the people.
Crowd-funding will allow our team to produce a product ourselves and reduce the time to market.  We believe in the creative goal of design. That, overall, the goal is to help people. Through this project, we want to bring this objective front and center.</p>
<h3><b>Why the Hangout
Case?</b></h3>
<p>The Hangout Case concept was inspired by the very people we ‘hang out’ with - our friends! As people living in the bustling and
work-obsessed metropolis of Hong Kong, time is precious and
opportunities to see friends are often few and far between. When we do have the chance to catch up, we just want to kick back and unwind. </p><p>The
Hangout Case is the perfect iPhone accessory that allows you to open a
few bottles of beer, light up that bbq, and capture that group pic you can wait to post
online.</p>
<p>Having your phone with you everywhere you go is the perfect
opportunity to make it a tool that comes in handy! Invite the Hangout Case to your next hangout! It’ll be an instant
conversation starter!</p><h3>Our Plans and Timeline</h3>
<p>Development of the Hangout Case began with 3D engineered drawings of its components on a computer. After drafting multiple
versions, it was prototyped and some internal components were fitted
to the prototypes. At the moment, we only have several of these prototypes, but we are
hoping to get production rolling with your support. </p>
<p>The
production process is costly, and often requires a great deal of investment. If
we are successful, our Indiegogo campaign will allow us to not only gauge the
interest of the public in the Hangout Case, but it will also allow us to
advance it’s overall development and enable us to share the Hangout Case with the world.</p>

<p><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></p>
<p>- This is our second crowdfunding project. Our first crowd funded project failed just before going into production. However, we have learned lessons and now better understand the risks across the product development and mass production cycles that startups have to experience.

For AnyTouch Blue we have resolved to start our funding campaign once the production schedule and costs are definitely determined.</p>
<p>- Cost risks. Our previous project consumed more than a million US dollar and the development also took more time than expected. Because of the current tight budget and production costs we are in need of supporters that believe in and can pre-order the product.</p>
<p>- Global market risks. Because AnyTouch is a new product, how to use it and the different ways it can be used are not widely known. We would like to overcome this through our backers by turning this product into a viral campaign.</p>

Risks and challenges
- This is our second crowdfunding project. Our first crowd funded project failed just before going into production. However, we have learned lessons and now better understand the risks across the product development and mass production cycles that startups have to experience. In our previous project there were risks of launching our crowdfunding campaign without knowing the specific mass production and final costs of the product, but we launched anyway hoping to be able to succeed. For AnyTouch Blue we have resolved to start our funding campaign once the production schedule and costs are definitely determined.
- Cost risks. Our previous project consumed more than a million US dollar and the development also took more time than expected. Because of the current tight budget and production costs we are in need of supporters that believe in and can pre-order the product.
- Global market risks. Because AnyTouch is a new product, how to use it and the different ways it can be used are not widely known. We would like to overcome this through our backers by turning this product into a viral campaign.
- Finally we would like to thank everyone with interest in our product and specially our supporters.",20.0,9,"3 Campaigns

<p>Our goal is to set the new Internet standard for digital written communication from unencrypted and unprotected to anonymized and encrypted.</p>
<p><b>p≡p</b> solutions are needed today to reclaim our privacy, not in two or three years. Please support us to make these solutions available now.</p>
<p><b>p≡p</b> is the only solution that allows you work with existing communication tools to provide full Internet privacy to private and corporate users. The solution can be implemented in an invisible layer to accommodate users’ existing ways of communicating. There is no learning curve! No changes! No pressures!</p>
<p>pEp-project.org is the open source project that is set to finally deliver free software for what the cypher-punk movement has been striving for since the late 1980: Easy Encryption for Everyone.</p>

<p style=""text-indent: 20px;font-style: italic;"">""<span style=""font-style: normal;""><b>p≡p</b></span> has enormous potential as it fills a need and it does for encryption the same thing that Skype did for VoIP: It takes an existing hard-to-use technology and makes it simple and easy for everyone to enjoy the benefits.""<br/><br/></p>

<p style=""text-indent: 20px;font-style: italic;"">""<span style=""font-style: normal;""><b>p≡p</b></span> has the potential to solve some of the largest obstacles to ubiquitous secure and private communication. It establishes a unified trust management that seamlessly integrates into all forms of digital communication and provides an easy-to-use and easy-to-understand interface to the user for managing his trust relationships. After a two decades struggle to teach users to manage certificates and install complex crypto plugins, this may be the right approach that is simple and yet powerful enough to enable secure communication for ordinary private and business users.""<br/><br/></p>
<p><b>Prof. Dr. Elgar Fleisch (ETH Zurich / Hochschule St.Gallen, Switzerland):</b></p>
<p style=""text-indent: 20px;font-style: italic;"">""Communicating via email today is like sending trade secrets on post cards. <span style=""font-style: normal;""><b>p≡p</b></span> addresses this major threat all business partners face – from SMEs to large corporates.

<p style=""text-indent: 20px;font-style: italic;"">""Now, more than ever, we need the means to interact and communicate while enjoying the security and privacy of our personal data.

Proposed solutions either reduced security for professional users, or were largely false promises, and sometimes dangerous. <span style=""font-style: normal;""><b>p≡p</b></span> is different. It makes strong cryptography secure, effortless and elegant for everyone. Strong setups stay strong. Everyone else's security gets lifted by orders of magnitude.

	changes the default for written digital messages from unencrypted and unprotected to anonymized and encrypted.







	is open source and available as free software.







	provides end-to-end encryption, peer-to-peer without central infrastructure. Our objective is to revolutionize the security industry by making privacy and security available to everyone. And that with no hassle!







	is zero-touch, secure and private communication on your own servers and on any hosted communication platform, like Microsoft Office365, Gmail, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Twitter Private Messages, SMS, ….







	makes privacy the default.


What are  ’s features?







p≡p is peer-to-peer communication with end-to-end encryption and an unmatched meta-data level of privacy.
		








p≡p will synchronize keys and contacts between all devices and hence provides a back-up of your key chain and contacts.
		










p≡p means converging all Mail and Messaging services into one single mobile App.
		








p≡p removes the complicated user driven key management through a zero-touch user experience.
		










p≡p works on any communication channel like E-Mail, Jabber, WhatsApp, Twitter,… and can integrate with any E-mail platform providing an API (Kolab, Gmail, ….)
		








p≡p is an automated key management solution for various key systems combined. It implements OpenPGP, S/MIME, CMS among others.
		










p≡p avoids all central infrastructure - like servers, portals, directories - and the vulnerabilities related to such centralized setups.
		








p≡p eliminates the man-in-the-middle with a simple 'handshake' based on safe words in your own language.
		










p≡p encrypts even without the same client on both sides.
		








p≡p does not slow down your computer.
		



 In summary: No Hassle Privacy

What is our Goal?
Our goal is to set the new Internet standard for digital written communication from unencrypted and unprotected to anonymized and encrypted.
p≡p solutions are needed today to reclaim our privacy, not in two or three years. Please support us to make these solutions available now.
p≡p is the only solution that allows you work with existing communication tools to provide full Internet privacy to private and corporate users. The solution can be implemented in an invisible layer to accommodate users’ existing ways of communicating. There is no learning curve! No changes! No pressures!
pEp-project.org is the open source project that is set to finally deliver free software for what the cypher-punk movement has been striving for since the late 1980: Easy Encryption for Everyone.


 impressions
Let’s see below two example of p≡p:
In Microsoft Windows/Outlook/Office365:
You double-click on the p≡p Outlook install file, then ‘Install’ and then ‘Finish’. Et voilà - you are up and running. No other action needed.





	When you e-mail a new friend, the first message will be unencrypted at trust level ‘Gray’, meaning it is as secure as any normal internet communication.







	If your friend can encrypt already, p≡p will automatically encrypt with him in his standard (PGP, S/MIME, CMS,…) at trust level 'Yellow', meaning the encryption is technically safe. Only the risk of a man-in-the-middle attack remains.
	You eliminate that risk with a simple phonecall (the Handshake) to exchange ‘Safe Words’ in your own language. p≡p issues these safe words once to you upon installation.







	Now you have reached trust level green: you are fully protected from any known attack.


On the iPhone:

How will the funds be used?
We will use the funds to create a foundation and to ramp up the delivery of more solutions based on the p≡p engine. We will also expedite the penetration of p≡p solutions in the community.
The commercialization of the corporate solution will happen through p≡p Security SA and provide a sustainable long-term funding for support and innovation.
As our goal is to provide everything as open-source software, your contributions will offer the financial means to create this software faster. This is where your contributions make a difference. 
The indicated US$ amounts below are cumulative, in other words for $300k we develop both an Android and iOS App.If we do not reach a level, we will nevertheless produce the solutions. If we receive only $200k for the iOS App (shortfall of $50k), we will nevertheless produce it. Only the timing and sequencing might change. 
Your contributions will be utilized to speed up the development of the following products and features:







				$50,000
			

				Android mobile App for p≡p











				$300,000
			

				iOS mobile App for p≡p











				$500,000

Endorsements
Lars Rabbe (former CIO of Yahoo & Skype):
""p≡p has enormous potential as it fills a need and it does for encryption the same thing that Skype did for VoIP: It takes an existing hard-to-use technology and makes it simple and easy for everyone to enjoy the benefits.""
Prof. Dr. Frank Kargl (University of Ulm, Germany):
""p≡p has the potential to solve some of the largest obstacles to ubiquitous secure and private communication. It establishes a unified trust management that seamlessly integrates into all forms of digital communication and provides an easy-to-use and easy-to-understand interface to the user for managing his trust relationships. After a two decades struggle to teach users to manage certificates and install complex crypto plugins, this may be the right approach that is simple and yet powerful enough to enable secure communication for ordinary private and business users.""
Prof. Dr. Elgar Fleisch (ETH Zurich / Hochschule St.Gallen, Switzerland):
""Communicating via email today is like sending trade secrets on post cards. p≡p addresses this major threat all business partners face – from SMEs to large corporates. It delivers a security solution that bases on an open and completely transparent technology stack, and that is so stunningly simple and non-interruptive to use, that it has all the ingredients to turn into a new standard.p≡p might as well help to solve emerging security issues in an Internet of Things, when smart objects communicate with humans.""
Prof. Dr. Peter Ryan (Security & Trust, University of Luxembourg):
""Now, more than ever, we need the means to interact and communicate while enjoying the security and privacy of our personal data. Up to now however, products and technologies to provide such security in a user friendly fashion have been scarce. The product suite being developed by p≡p shows promise of redressing this situation and helping to usher in an era in which Johnny can encrypt.""
Georg Greve (Founding President of FSFE and CEO of Kolab Systems):
""Making cryptography effortless to use has been one of the toughest nuts to crack. Proposed solutions either reduced security for professional users, or were largely false promises, and sometimes dangerous. p≡p is different. It makes strong cryptography secure, effortless and elegant for everyone. Strong setups stay strong. Everyone else's security gets lifted by orders of magnitude. No project of the past two years will do more to increase security and privacy on a global scale. Kolab* has been the leading open security-centric collaboration solution for over ten years. Together with p≡p we'll dramatically increase the level of usability for all our current and future users.""(* Kolab was initially developed to the requirements of the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) and is still used there)
Meinhard Starostik (Solicitor and Judge at the Constitutional Court, Berlin):
""We have been deprived of our privacy by government agencies. It seems there is no one to help this but ourselves. p≡p is a wonderful device to do so. Let's get started, let's fund p≡p.""
padeluun (Artist and Honorary Member of Chaos Computer Club, Germany):
""What we urgently need is encryption and anonymization for everyone. p≡p is a project which offers exactly that. I'm supporting p≡p – please do so, too!""

Why do we need your help?
Several initiatives were launched since the ‘Snowden Revelations’, and we support all of them. Nevertheless none of them has enabled the Internet users to easily protect their privacy and led to mass adoption yet.
We designed p≡p with the user in mind, as the solution that seamlessly integrates with the habits of the user, avoids central infrastructure and is available for many platforms, mail clients, and communication channels. And we need that solution – p≡p – now for all environments!
Help us promote the spread of p≡p solutions by multiplying our development team and regain your privacy now. Your donations will ensure that we can continue to provide you further free, open source versions of the p≡p software to protect your digital privacy.

What type of contribution do you prefer?





Why do we still need p≡p?p≡p is needed because as of today no solution has been brought to market that is transparent to the user and that requires no interaction on the user’s part. We are still without a simple, open and common system to protect our privacy, which is appreciated by all user groups – corporate, consumer & community.



In what ways is p≡p different from other encryption solutions?Most solutions are too difficult to use, others have introduced central elements (and hence unnecessary risk) to simplify key management.p≡p eliminates the complicated key management with a zero-touch approach for the users as well as the administrators.p≡p is the only solution that allows you work with existing communication tools to
provide full Internet privacy to private and corporate users. The solution
can be implemented in an invisible layer to accommodate users’ existing ways of
communicating. It will protect you automagically on all channels (e-mail, messaging, SMS, …). It also supports multiple encryption standards automatically and you do not need p≡p client on both sides to encrypt successfully. However, if you have p≡p on both sides, you will get meta-data anonymization in addition to encryption.



Am I supporting terrorism while using p≡p?No, absolutely not. Cryptography solutions have existed for a long time. Sophisticated and motivated users have mastered these tools since the late ‘90s.p≡p does not create anything new, only integrates these existing tools and makes them available to less sophisticated users. p≡p does not protect any suspect(s) against a targeted surveillance by our law enforcement services. p≡p only protects your constitutional rights to privacy.
		Please find here two pertinent quotes from the White House NSA Review Panel
		a) “[…] there has been no instance in which NSA could say with confidence that the outcome [of a terror investigation] would have been any different” [without the metadata]
		b) Communication metadata adds “only a modest contribution to the nation security”



Can I still send encrypted messages if my friends don`t have p≡p?If your friends cannot encrypt, we offer 2 possibilities:
		1) You can send an encrypted message to your friend with a link that allows them to download a free p≡p reader. 
		2) You can send them an unencrypted message inviting them to install p≡p or another encryption tool like OpenPGP, and your first reply after this installation will be encrypted completely automatically.



Does it work with all mail providers?Yes, if you use p≡p in your mail client, such as Microsoft Outlook, Thunderbird, Apple Mail...
		If you only use webmail through a browser, then we will support all those webmail providers that provide an API for our browser plug-ins. This will be the case with providers like Kolab, Gmail, …



How long does it take to set up p≡p?On your computer, the automated set-up takes about 30 seconds and does not ask any questions. The installer does it all for you in the background.



How can I send an encrypted mail to a new contact?Simply by installing p≡p or sending a message if you already have p≡p installed. If your friend has p≡p already installed then your communication is encrypted, if your friend uses another technology like S/MIME or PGP, it will work seamlessly as well.



Is the subject and metadata of my email encrypted as well?If both parties use p≡p, then the subject and metadata are encrypted as well.



What happens if I already have PGP installed on my computer?p≡p will recognize this automatically upon installation and will use the installed keys for encryption.



Will p≡p indicate how good my privacy is?p≡p shows the level of trust you have with your contacts. If the trust level is grey, there is not enough information to indicate any trust. If the trust level is yellow, your encryption is technically perfect, but you are still vulnerable to a man-in-the middle attack. After the handshake with safewords, you have the highest trust level (green) where you are protected against any known attack and you can securely communicate with that contact on all your p≡p devices.



Can I use webmail in the browser with p≡p?Yes, we will provide free browser plugins for all major browsers that allow you to use p≡p with webmail in the browser.



What do you mean by zero touch?Zero-touch means that the user does not need to do anything to create and manage keys nor to communicate at the highest level of privacy available with his/her counterpart (other than the handshake).



Do you store my data?No, p≡p is completely peer-to-peer with end-to-end encryption. Hence we are not storing any data of any kind. We just provide you with the p≡p software or app.



Are e-mails and instant messages stored encrypted on my iPhone or Android phone?No, they will be stored unencrypted but you have the option to store them encrypted.



Can I use p≡p with WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger?p≡p mobile app will encrypt communication with WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger contacts if both parties use p≡p.



Which versions of Outlook are supported?From Outlook 2010 & up. And Office365 is secured of course.



I use different e-mail accounts. Can p≡p work with all of them when I install it on my computer?Yes, p≡p works with all accounts and will add those addresses to your key if needed.



I want to reinstall my computer, do I have to backup p≡p or can I just re-install it and will p≡p function immediately?If you have p≡p on a single device, you will need to back-up. If you have p≡p on another device it is possible to receive the key pair without backing up from that device using the new key from your newly installed system - as p≡p synchronizes all your devices securely peer-to-peer.


What type of contribution do you prefer?We prefer and recommend that you contribute directly by credit card, not via Paypal.
		Paypal’s support for privacy initiatives is at least questionable, as the disaster it caused for the crowdfunding campaign of our same minded friends from Protonmail shows.
		As in the support of all communication tools, we decided not to limit the options of our contributors and impose channels. Hence we keep Paypal switched on for those that prefer this option.

<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>Help me help myself to get TMS treatment for Autism/Depression:</p>
<p>My name is Sharmaine. I am 35 and from California. I have high-functioning Autism or what used to be called Asperger's Syndrome and Major Depression/GAD and I need help. I was misdiagnosed for many years and was put through the torture of pretty much every psychiatric medicine out there.</p>
<p>This campaign is to raise funds to have a treatment called TMS or Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation. You can learn more at Neurostar.com and also see a first hand experience told by a famous author who is also Autistic(linked in videos). Medicare currently only covers this treatment in 3 states and I am unfortunately not a resident of any of them and cannot afford this on my fixed limited income.</p>
<p>This treatment has the potential to completely alter my life and give me a better chance at being a successful member of your community. I want to go to college successfully and be able to function on my own.</p>
<p>Your contributions not only help me out but they help everyone out if you think about it. If I'm able to lead a more successful life I will no longer be completely dependant on my family, friends, community and government to take care of me.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm raising a base amount of $12,000 dollars. This is a new treatment, and although approved by the FDA it's expensive.</p>
<p>The only thing I can offer in return at the moment is my unending gratitude and I can knit scarves and make necklaces for donors. Any additional monies left over will go towards my education.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is so important. As we move forward as a society with so many people being affected by Autism, people have to take notice. We need help and we want to be functioning people. We aren't lazy, we aren't stupid. We just function differently and need some assistance navigating humanity so we can be successful too.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you can't donate, pass this around to the people you know. I don't have a lot of friends and could use the visability.</p>

So you can connect just about any appliance, such as a stove top, 12V thermo-electric cooler, your smartphone and more.<div>
<br/><h4>Power output</h4>
<p>Our M24 mPower Solar Generator can power enough devices simultaneously for up to 1200 watts. <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/mpower-solar-generator-clean-power-anywhere-you-go--2/edit#applications"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">See the application examples above for more details</a>.</p>
<h4>Daisy chain for more power</h4>
<p>If you need even more power from your generator, you can daisy chain two or more mPower Solar Generators to double, triple or more, the available energy.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>mPower App</h4>
<p>The mPower is the world’s first solar generator to come with a smart App, which is very much needed to keep you powered, extend the life of the battery and deliver the best value for your investment.</p>
<p>The App delivers the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Estimated time to charge or discharge of the battery.</li>
<li>How to orientate the solar panels with respect to the sun for optimum generation of power.</li>
<li>Local weather forecast for the coming days. If cloudy or rainy, the App calculates if the reduced solar generation will be enough to power your typical consumption. If needed, it alerts you so you can choose to save energy today to have more power during the upcoming cloudy days.</li>
</ul>

<h2 style=""color:#39b54a;"">Our <span style=""color:#f37224;"">BUY 1 — DONATE 1</span> Model</h2>
<p>Why “Buy 1—Donate 1”?<br/>
Because in developing countries, <b>one billion people still depend on kerosene for light. </b>And the burning of kerosene lamps leads to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The equivalent of smoking 4 packs of cigarettes a day</li>
<li>Respiratory illnesses such as asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia and lung cancer</li>
<li>The premature death of 1.5 million people every year</li>
<li>Trapping a family in poverty—about 20% of their income goes into buying kerosene</li>
<li>Global warming—kerosene burnt in Africa releases more CO2 than all CO2 released in the UK</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460726481/buy-1-donate-1_fb6zgs.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Within our Perks (see right column) you'll find that <b>when you buy one M12 or one M24 Solar Generator, we'll donate in your name one M6 Solar Generator</b> plus an LED light to one family without electricity. Enough for this family to charge their cellphones, have harmless light at night and stop using their kerosene lamp. The M6 and the LED light save them time and miles of walking, and give them a better quality of life so they can read and study to escape poverty.<br/>This may feel like a drop in the ocean, helping a handful of people out of the billion without electricity, but your contribution will be LIFE-CHANGING for the one family that receives an mPower Solar Generator because of your purchase.</p>
<p><b><span style=""color:#f37224;"">IMPORTANT NOTE:</span> You do not pay more because of the donations.</b></p>
<p>Why? Because instead of spending money on advertising, we redirect this money and part of our profits, towards the donations.</p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461695436/Sharing_Tutorial_gjy7vt.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Who can participate in the #LightUptheWorld Challenge?</b>
<br/><u>Anyone from around the world</u> that is 18 years old or older, by Apr-11-2016. General requirements are: passion for volunteerism and for helping families in need, enthusiasm about the outdoors and overcoming challenges, ability to engage with others and successfully lead teams, willingness to visit places with precarious accommodations and good written and verbal English skills
</p>
<p><b>Does it matter for the #LightUptheWorld Challenge the amount contributed by the 'Referrals' I attract to the campaign?</b>
<br/>No. The only thing that matters for the #LightUptheWorld Challenge is how many 'Referrals' actually visit the campaign. They do NOT need to contribute to add 'Referrals' points to your performance in the challenge.</p>
<p><b>Can I check how many 'Referrals' I’ve attracted so far within the #LightUptheWorld Challenge?</b>
<br/>Of course. You can check as often as you want to. Please refer to the following instructions to do so: <a href=""https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/203660683"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/203660683</a></p>
<p><b>How do I know if I am within the 12 finalists in the #LightUptheWorld Challenge?</b>
<br/>Starting May-10 we will send a weekly email informing their performance to the participants ranked within the Top 12 in the challenge (and also to those that are close to reach the Top 12). To make sure you will be receiving these emails please send us an email to community@mpowersolargenerator.com with the subject '#LightUptheWord Challenge' and your Indiegogo user name.</p>
<p><b>Are there other compensation components beyond the US$ 150,000 annual salary?</b></p>
<p>Yes! Additionally to the salary, the company will provide the mPower Ambassador with 12 round trip airfares from Applicant’s home nearest capital city, all travel expenses paid during the year of the assignment while delivering the donated solar generators and travel insurance for the same period.
</p>
<p><b>Does the Buy 1-Donate 1 business model impact the retail prices of the mPower Solar Generators?</b>
<br/>No. For-profit companies spend lots of money in advertising.  We use the advertising money (plus, a portion of our profits) for donations instead of doing
advertising. We are confident that lots of caring people also want to help create a better world and one way of helping is by spreading the word about causes and products they care about.  In this way, the portion of the sale that
usually gets reinvested in advertising, we can instead use it for donations resulting in a win/win/win for our customers, the company and the recipient of
the donation.</p>
<p><b>Where will you send the donated mPower Solar Generators?</b>
<br/>The units donated as a result of the current Indiegogo campaign will be delivered by the mPower Ambassador jointly with TECHO's team to families without access to electricity in Haiti.  After this campaign we will evaluate and design a distribution program to bring much needed mPower Solar Generators to other countries.</p>
<p><b>What is TECHO?</b>
<br/>TECHO.org (which means roof, in Spanish) is a youth led organization present in Latin America &amp; the Caribbean that seeks to overcome poverty in slums through engaging the joint work of volunteers and families living in extreme poverty. Over the last 19 years, through the work and donations of more than 750,000 caring volunteers and donors, TECHO has built over 100,000 transitional homes in 19 Latin-American countries for the poorest of the poor. Upon completion, TECHO implements social inclusion programs to show these people how to escape poverty for good.</p>
<p><b>Are mPower Solar Generators available in stores?</b>

Our Products

Our mPower Solar Generator provides a way to charge your devices & appliances with clean power anytime, anywhere.
In the U.S. there are instances when grid electricity is not available: outdoor recreation (camping, off-road & RV travel, boating), off-grid homes, outdoor work (film, photography, construction), and blackouts that affect some 150 million Americans annually.
In developing countries, one Billion people depend on kerosene for light with no access to a power source during the night. Kerosene smoke causes asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, and cancer; leading to the death of 1.5 million people every year. Your purchase of one mPower Solar Generator provides one family with clean electricity.

mPower Solar Generator Applications



Our M24 Solar Generator can power enough devices simultaneously for up to 1200 watts (M12: 600 watts)- that could be up to 24 full charges for a laptop! You get DC from the battery via two 5V USB ports, 12V from the two cigarette lighter connectors, and thanks to its internal inverter, you get alternating current (AC) via the two 110V (or 220V) sockets.








The mPower unique smart App will estimate the time to charge or discharge of the battery, help you orientate the solar panels with respect to the sun for optimum power generation and might even suggest you to save energy based on your typical consumption and the local weather forecast.



So what can you do with the mPower Solar Generator?  Here are some applications:
Take it Camping

Use your mPower Solar Generator to power a portable cooler, an electric burner, a coffee maker, an air mattress blower or even a heated blanket to keep you warm at night.  And of course you can use it to recharge all your devices from smartphones, to digital cameras and tablets.See the table below for the battery capacity of our three models (M6, M12 & M24) for camping applications.

Use it during Blackouts

Use your mPower for critical needs such as light, coffee maker and microwave, as well as to stay connected to the world through your smartphones, tablets, laptops and Wi-Fi; and why not for entertainment powering your TV, DVR and even a game console.See the table below for the battery capacity of our three models (M6, M12& M24) for blackout situations.

And this is not all, just about anywhere you need portable power you can consider using an mPower Solar Generator.
The solar panel charges the battery during the day and the battery provides you electricity day and night.  The following day, the panel recharges the battery, restarting the process.

Key FeaturesSturdy off road wheelsSturdy, off-road wheels that don’t break and don’t sink into the sand.Light durable casingThe mPower Solar Generator's casing is made from the lightest, yet most durable, polypropylene material on Earth. It is the same material used by the world’s top suitcase manufacturers, to ensure that almost everyone in your family can load the mPower in your trunk.OutletsEach mPower comes with two USB sockets and two 12V socket, and our M12 and M24 also have 110V (220V) outlets. So you can connect just about any appliance, such as a stove top, 12V thermo-electric cooler, your smartphone and more.
Power output
Our M24 mPower Solar Generator can power enough devices simultaneously for up to 1200 watts. See the application examples above for more details.
Daisy chain for more power
If you need even more power from your generator, you can daisy chain two or more mPower Solar Generators to double, triple or more, the available energy.

mPower App
The mPower is the world’s first solar generator to come with a smart App, which is very much needed to keep you powered, extend the life of the battery and deliver the best value for your investment.
The App delivers the following information:

Estimated time to charge or discharge of the battery.
How to orientate the solar panels with respect to the sun for optimum generation of power.
Local weather forecast for the coming days. If cloudy or rainy, the App calculates if the reduced solar generation will be enough to power your typical consumption. If needed, it alerts you so you can choose to save energy today to have more power during the upcoming cloudy days.

Our BUY 1 — DONATE 1 Model
Why “Buy 1—Donate 1”?
Because in developing countries, one billion people still depend on kerosene for light. And the burning of kerosene lamps leads to:

The equivalent of smoking 4 packs of cigarettes a day
Respiratory illnesses such as asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia and lung cancer
The premature death of 1.5 million people every year
Trapping a family in poverty—about 20% of their income goes into buying kerosene
Global warming—kerosene burnt in Africa releases more CO2 than all CO2 released in the UK


Within our Perks (see right column) you'll find that when you buy one M12 or one M24 Solar Generator, we'll donate in your name one M6 Solar Generator plus an LED light to one family without electricity. Enough for this family to charge their cellphones, have harmless light at night and stop using their kerosene lamp. The M6 and the LED light save them time and miles of walking, and give them a better quality of life so they can read and study to escape poverty.This may feel like a drop in the ocean, helping a handful of people out of the billion without electricity, but your contribution will be LIFE-CHANGING for the one family that receives an mPower Solar Generator because of your purchase.
IMPORTANT NOTE: You do not pay more because of the donations.
Why? Because instead of spending money on advertising, we redirect this money and part of our profits, towards the donations.


We believe every adult and child in the world should have access to electricity and through our BUY 1 — DONATE 1 model, we aim to provide millions of units to developing countries.



Access to electricity is essential to a family’s health, safety, education, economic progress and quality of life.
Imagine what your life would be without electricity. Say goodbye to your cellphone, laptop, internet, TV, radio, music, refrigerator, air conditioning, lights at night, most medical exams, treatments, surgeries and much more.
Well, one billion people don’t need to imagine life without electricity, they experience it every day of their lives.
Read how these people manage their lives without electricity.




“To study at night I use the light of a kerosene lamp. Many
children in our town have developed early sight problems due to the effort they
have to make to read.""—Nordine, from La Hatt, Haiti







“There’s no electricity in our village. We need to recharge
our cellphones to stay connected and to use them as a lamp at night. To
recharge my phone I travel to the nearest town with electricity, which is 15
miles away.”—Lacrete, from La Digue, Haiti









“Whenever my little brothers need my help with their homework when I return from work, I take them to la route nationale, which is an illuminated road about one mile away from home and our closest source of light at night. Many neighbors do the same.”—Louis, from La Hatt, Haiti

Why we need your help?
Through this campaign we are launching the mPower Solar Generator to provide clean portable energy, with a business model aimed at improving the daily life of families in need around the world.
Your contribution to this campaign will directly impact many of the one billion people without access to electricity.

How can you help?



Historically, gas generators have provided off-grid or portable electricity.
But gas generators have significant limitations


Solar energy has hardly any of these problems
Some products claim to be solar generators but they come in separate pieces with solar panels on one hand and batteries on the other, and they require you to carry each piece separately and additional setup.
Our mPower Solar Generator is all-in-one, easy to carry, easy to set up and easy to use.

Models M24, M12 & M6 (left to right). More details here.

Here are some of the other main differences between the mPower Solar Generator and a comparable solar kit currently on the market, which as you can see is not an all-in-one solution:



And like all technologies, solutions to the same problem evolve

Partnerships & collaborators

Through our BUY 1 — DONATE 1 program, initially, we’ll make donations through the amazing non-profit organization TECHO (which means roof in Spanish).
TECHO is youth led and present in Latin America & the Caribbean. Through the joint work of families living in extreme poverty with youth volunteers, TECHO seeks to overcome poverty in slums.
Over the last 19 years, through the work and donations of more than 750,000 caring volunteers and donors, TECHO has built over 100,000 transitional homes in 19 Latin-American countries for the poorest of the poor. Upon completion, TECHO implements social inclusion programs to show these people how to escape poverty for good.
We will be distributing the mPower Solar Generators with TECHO's Haiti organization.

United Nations has called on businesses, governments, and civil society to achieve Sustainable Energy for All by 2030.
The Energy Access Practitioner Network is at the heart of the movement to bring sustainable energy for all, helping expand energy access in 170 countries, facilitating partnerships and finance and catalyzing national efforts to move towards a clean energy future.

FAQs
** We are constantly adding more FAQs into this section, if your
question is NOT covered here please send as an inquiry and we'll get back to
you as soon as we can**
How do I share this campaign to get Referrals for the #LightUptheWorld Challenge?
Just make sure you are signed in to Indiegogo and use the social sharing menu on the left of this page (see below) to send a personalized link to your friends and family.


Who can participate in the #LightUptheWorld Challenge?
Anyone from around the world that is 18 years old or older, by Apr-11-2016. General requirements are: passion for volunteerism and for helping families in need, enthusiasm about the outdoors and overcoming challenges, ability to engage with others and successfully lead teams, willingness to visit places with precarious accommodations and good written and verbal English skills

Does it matter for the #LightUptheWorld Challenge the amount contributed by the 'Referrals' I attract to the campaign?
No. The only thing that matters for the #LightUptheWorld Challenge is how many 'Referrals' actually visit the campaign. They do NOT need to contribute to add 'Referrals' points to your performance in the challenge.
Can I check how many 'Referrals' I’ve attracted so far within the #LightUptheWorld Challenge?
Of course. You can check as often as you want to. Please refer to the following instructions to do so: https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/203660683
How do I know if I am within the 12 finalists in the #LightUptheWorld Challenge?
Starting May-10 we will send a weekly email informing their performance to the participants ranked within the Top 12 in the challenge (and also to those that are close to reach the Top 12). To make sure you will be receiving these emails please send us an email to community@mpowersolargenerator.com with the subject '#LightUptheWord Challenge' and your Indiegogo user name.
Are there other compensation components beyond the US$ 150,000 annual salary?
Yes! Additionally to the salary, the company will provide the mPower Ambassador with 12 round trip airfares from Applicant’s home nearest capital city, all travel expenses paid during the year of the assignment while delivering the donated solar generators and travel insurance for the same period.

Does the Buy 1-Donate 1 business model impact the retail prices of the mPower Solar Generators?
No. For-profit companies spend lots of money in advertising.  We use the advertising money (plus, a portion of our profits) for donations instead of doing
advertising. We are confident that lots of caring people also want to help create a better world and one way of helping is by spreading the word about causes and products they care about.  In this way, the portion of the sale that
usually gets reinvested in advertising, we can instead use it for donations resulting in a win/win/win for our customers, the company and the recipient of
the donation.
Where will you send the donated mPower Solar Generators?
The units donated as a result of the current Indiegogo campaign will be delivered by the mPower Ambassador jointly with TECHO's team to families without access to electricity in Haiti.  After this campaign we will evaluate and design a distribution program to bring much needed mPower Solar Generators to other countries.
What is TECHO?
TECHO.org (which means roof, in Spanish) is a youth led organization present in Latin America & the Caribbean that seeks to overcome poverty in slums through engaging the joint work of volunteers and families living in extreme poverty. Over the last 19 years, through the work and donations of more than 750,000 caring volunteers and donors, TECHO has built over 100,000 transitional homes in 19 Latin-American countries for the poorest of the poor. Upon completion, TECHO implements social inclusion programs to show these people how to escape poverty for good.
Are mPower Solar Generators available in stores?
Currently, mPower products are available exclusively on Indiegogo.
Where is the mPower Solar Generator manufactured?
We invented the mPower Solar Generator in Florida, USA, the Sunshine State, where we will continue to design, develop and ultimately assemble the product with the very best components sourced from around the world.
What are the characteristics of the main components of the
mPower Solar Generator?
The mPower M12 and M24 include: crystalline silicon flexible solar panels, lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries with an embedded battery management system (BMS) that includes overcharge and over discharge protection, pure sine wave inverters, and thermal circuit breakers.
Do I need any additional cables or components in order to use
the mPower Solar Generator?
No. The mPower Solar Generator has been designed to be ready to
use by any adult without the need of additional cables or components.
Can anyone use the mPower Solar Generator?
The mPower Solar Generator generates and store electric power similar to that of the electric grid at home. Minors should never use the mPower Solar Generator without adult supervision.
Can I connect additional solar panels to the mPower Solar Generator?
Yes, the mPower M12 and M24 accept additional solar panels to be connected to them. You will need special cables available from mPower that are not included with the product since they are not part of its core functionality.
Can I get more power by connecting two mPower Solar Generators together?
Yes, you can connect (daisy-chain) two mPower Solar Generators with special cables available from mPower.
What warranty do you offer on the mPower Solar Generator?
All mPower Solar Generators have a 1 year warranty including all of the components, even the battery.  The above warranty covers only defects arising under normal use and does not include malfunctions or failures resulting from misuse, abuse, neglect, alteration, problems with electrical power, usage not in accordance with product instructions, acts of nature, or improper installation or repairs made by anyone other than mPower or mPower’s authorized third-party service provider.
Where do you ship?
We ship worldwide! We make sure we ship the mPower Solar Generator according to safety transportation requirements.
Do you have a prototype ready?
Yes! We’ve built a fully-functional prototype following precise UL Certification guidelines and then produced a 3D printed case to fine-tune the design and test the connecting parts.",42.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>We spend a lot of time typing on our smartphones: writing emails, sending messages, and replying to comments on social media. While there are some keyboard apps that improve the screen-typing experience, a physical keyboard remains the best way to type on any electronic device. </p>
<p>Unfortunately for keyboard fans, there are only a few smartphones with keyboards to choose from and those tend to be older brands that lack the style, features and convenience that modern digital lifestyles require.  </p>
<p>That’s why we, Unihertz, created the all new, Titan. After two successful Kickstarter campaigns with over 20,000 backers, we are back with our latest launch - Titan the ultimate QWERTY phone for people who get things done! <strong>Titan is an unbreakable and versatile smartphone for working professionals, outdoor enthusiasts and QWERTY lovers.</strong></p>

 For People Who Get Sh*t Done
We spend a lot of time typing on our smartphones: writing emails, sending messages, and replying to comments on social media. While there are some keyboard apps that improve the screen-typing experience, a physical keyboard remains the best way to type on any electronic device. 
Unfortunately for keyboard fans, there are only a few smartphones with keyboards to choose from and those tend to be older brands that lack the style, features and convenience that modern digital lifestyles require.  
That’s why we, Unihertz, created the all new, Titan. After two successful Kickstarter campaigns with over 20,000 backers, we are back with our latest launch - Titan the ultimate QWERTY phone for people who get things done!

<p>Hi! We're Francis and Vidar - and we're building an iPhone app that revolutionizes how you capture and share your experiences - your life - by changing the format to one second videos. Less is more.</p>
<p><strong>Not convinced of the potential?</strong> Watch this <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjD995hJKOM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">AMAZING video</a> by Kevin Kelly to see the real power of one second videos:</p>
<p><a href=""http://youtu.be/OjD995hJKOM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Screenshot of One Second Vacation by Kevin Kelly on YouTube"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7131/7629442044_0bb5665470_z.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<p>                                                           </p>
<h1>Why?</h1>
<p>We love photography AND we love video. But shooting and editing good videos can be hard. Especially on a mobile phone. Long videos are also less immediate than a still image. That's why we often end up shooting pictures instead of videos.</p>
<p>But a static image can only contain so much information. Only so many emotions. Only so much of the ambience. And it has no sound.</p>
<p>That's why we created OneSec! It combines the simplicity and immediacy of pictures with all the advantages of video.</p>
<p>OneSec makes shooting and sharing videos fun and simple by changing the format to one second shots!</p>
<p>Like Twitter limits your tweet to 140 characters, OneSec limits your video to one second per shot. You then use the app to combine those shots into an awesome video.</p>
<p>We were inspired by the work of the awesome <a href=""https://twitter.com/CesarKuriyama"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cesar Kuriyama</a> and <a href=""http://www.kk.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kevin Kelly</a> to create this app. </p>

<h1>How?</h1>
<p>We're ready to build an awesome iPhone app for you to shoot and share one second videos!</p>
<p>But before we continue, we need to secure a little bit of funding. That's where <strong>YOU</strong> come in.</p>
<p>As much as this is a labor of love for us, love doesn't pay our rent or feed our families as we work on this. That's why we are asking for a donation, only as much as you think you can spare and as much as you think it would be worth to you.</p>
<p>Once we have secured basic funding, you can expect us to complete the app by the end of the summer.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>What?</h1>
<p>In return we'll give you appropriately awesome high-quality perks! Just check out the amazing list of perks on the right hand side of this page. Check back regularly - The list is always growing!</p>
<p>We're confident you'll find something that tickles your fancy and suits your budget.</p>
<p>And of course you'll get the OneSec app! It will be yours for free on the AppStore. Be sure to grab the $100 perk if you want it sooner, though!</p>
<p>And you'll get the satisfaction of seeing decent folks succeed.</p>

<p>We're both independent, self-financed startup entrepreneurs.

(Not to worry - those projects are still going full steam ahead. We're just continuing building while our teams take a well-deserved summer break.)</p>
<p>Together we thought we'd test and validate if crowd funding is a viable way to finance the creation great iPhone apps. So we decided to collaborate on this next awesome social mobile video photo app for you!</p>
<p>It sounds like a fun and exciting summer project to us. </p>

<h1>How are we going to spend it all?</h1>
<p>On boat drinks and party hats.</p>
<p>Noooo! Good party hats are actually hard to come by and this amount won't cover boats to go with the drinks.</p>
<p>We might have some awesome developer superpowers, but we still have to eat and pay our bills just like everybody else. You see, the boring truth is that awesome app creators are just people too.</p>
<p>The amount we are looking to raise will go towards covering the income lost (we're self-employed) in the period that we are focusing 100% on finishing OneSec. Just to make sure it gets the undivided love it deserves and to deliver an amazing product to you.</p>
<p>We think it's a <a href=""http://www.quora.com/How-much-does-it-cost-to-build-an-iPhone-app"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">modest amount</a>, considering the collective awesomeness we're putting into it.</p>
<p>And some of what you pledge is of course also going towards assuring that you get really awesome high-quality perks for your money.</p>
<p>And most likely, it cost more to create all of this than the amount pledged in total.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>What will we do if we raise more?</h1>
<p>We'll add it to our boat drinks and party hats slush fund.</p>
<p>No - We're kidding! We already tried that last year. The party hats didn't qualify as a tax deductible and everything sort of backfired. Don't ask.</p>
<p>Seriously - We will put all proceeding funds in a bucket for our next app project - where <strong>YOU</strong> get to vote on what we should build next!</p>
<p>How does that sound?</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>What if you can't or won't donate some of your hard earned money?</h1>
<p>You'll have to pay for boat drinks and party hats the next time you see us.</p>

<p><strong>1. Sharing is caring!</strong></p>
<p>Share this project to all your friends, contacts and random strangers! Again. And again! Share the link to this page on Facebook, Twitter and Google+.</p>
<p>At least you can pretend that you care, right? Everybody's good enough for some share-care.</p>
<p><strong>2. A little like-love goes a long way!</strong></p>
<p>It's more than symbolic - it actually helps us. Seriously! The more you share and like, the more exposure we get on this awesome IndieGoGo thing!</p>
<p>Like THIS page, like our page on Facebook and like our videos on YouTube, share us on Facebook, Twitter and Google+. Click, click, click!</p>
<p>At least you're good for a little (or A LOT of) like-love, right?</p>
<p><strong>3. Talk about this!</strong></p>
<p>Talk about this project with your friends, family, contacts and random strangers!</p>
<p>We know you know someone that may know someone who knows someone who would love to publish something about this somewhere. We know. Don't deny it.</p>
<p>It's SUMMER and everybody is craving for a story - and we're it! We'll sing, dance - and wear party hats for anyone remotely interested. We'll make it worth their while and do zany interviews. We're easy!</p>
<p>We also know that you know people who are not on the Internet. Yes. We know. Drag them over to the nearest browser and show them our project page, have them pull out their wallets and sit them through the whole payment process. You know they want to support us!</p>

Wearing the headset while sleeping or bathing is not comfortable. Bluetooth device radiation adds to the radiation pollution already around us. But, this new piece of device which is worn as a neck sweatband with a sensitive throat microphone has none of these drawbacks, and will have a unique voice based SOS switch apart from the usual SOS push button (<b>the stretch sensors or the capacitive touch sensors would anyway switch on if anyone presses on the neck too hard</b>).

digital world.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We were working on Touchless Technology devices for over more than 8 months from the initial stage of the company. We had developed a couple of products called Tryara, a virtual tool where you can try out jewelry without even touching them, Ferne Player- a Blackberry store app by which you can control the music player of your smartphone touch-less. After these products we always felt some factor missing in the technology itself.and it was the interaction mode. We stood in customer shoes and found its most suitable when you can actually feel it very close to you. That's how Fin was evolved. Fin removes all the stress and strain required while interacting with touchless devices.Your palm is your control.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><b><span>What Is FIN?</span></b><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p>Fin is a tiny hardware product that you can
wear on your thumb as a ring and it will make your whole palm as a gesture
interface. Fin can uniquely recognize each segments of the fingers and can
convert your palm into a numeric keypad. Fin is a Bluetooth enabled device that
we can connect to three different digital gadgets like Smartphones, Smart
TVs, Automobiles, and Home automation devices providing multiple device
compatibility. Fin reads different gestures from your palm and its
corresponding values control connected devices. </p><p></p><p> It uses smart Low Energy Technology such as Bluetooth for Communication with connected devices.<b style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><span> </span></b></p><p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><span></span></b></p><p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/297504/files/20140108064704-product-fin.jpg?1389192424"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p><p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/332036/files/20140127042516-finwithhand.jpg?1390825516"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p><p></p><p style=""display: inline !important;""><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/302547/files/20140111064338-What-is-Fin.jpg?1389451418"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);""/></b></p><p></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3><b><span style=""font-size: 13.5pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0.7pt;"">Unique Features Of FIN </span></b></h3><p><b><span style=""font-size: 13.5pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0.7pt;""></span></b></p><p></p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/301084/files/20140110101324-Unique-feature.jpg?1389377604"" src="""" style=""width: 604.7529411764706px; height: 362px;""/></b></p><p></p><h3>Fin can help 285+ million visually impaired to interact with Technology </h3><p>Here is a video feedback from some blind people on how Fin can make their life better and to have that hope and light in the life.</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe border=""0"" height=""326"" src=""https://media.embed.ly/1/frame?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dqi7evaeOSCs&amp;width=580&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;height=326&amp;secure=true"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p><h3><b><span style=""font-size: 13.5pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0.7pt;"">Where Are We Now? </span></b></h3><p><b><span style=""font-size: 13.5pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0.7pt;""></span></b></p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/301095/files/20140110101607-Where-are-we.jpg?1389377767"" src="""" style=""width: 575.0759878419453px; height: 344px;""/></b></p><p></p><h3></h3><p><b><span style=""font-size: 13.5pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0.7pt;"">Where Is The Money Going?</span></b><br/></p><p>Fin is a

If you were impressed by Fin, just wait until you see neyya!How Fin Makes Your Life EasierThis is how configurable Fin is! You can assign each activities of connected devices to each segments of your fingers and it can act like Hot Keys. Example: Just a tap using thumb on the Segment of the Finger to Make your Phone Silent Mode ON/OFF while phone in your pocketFeaturedFin Going for live demo at GSMA World Mobile Congress 2014, As Rohildev, the Founder of Fin is the Youngest Conference Speaker in the event .




Fin is one of the TOP 15 Startups in the world in TechCrunch Hardware Battlefield 2014 during CES2014 at Las Vegas.













 Who Are We?RHL Vision Technologies Pvt. Ltd. is a group of passionate individuals incubated at Startup Village, Cochin and a corporate office as Fin Robotics,Inc at Palo Alto,CA, who dream of a world where technology runs in the palm of your hand. Having a passion
to change the way humans interact with technology, long hours of
brainstorming led RHL Vision Technologies to come up with the Fin, A small wearable ring by which you can control your entire
digital world.We were working on Touchless Technology devices for over more than 8 months from the initial stage of the company. We had developed a couple of products called Tryara, a virtual tool where you can try out jewelry without even touching them, Ferne Player- a Blackberry store app by which you can control the music player of your smartphone touch-less. After these products we always felt some factor missing in the technology itself.and it was the interaction mode. We stood in customer shoes and found its most suitable when you can actually feel it very close to you. That's how Fin was evolved. Fin removes all the stress and strain required while interacting with touchless devices.Your palm is your control.What Is FIN?Fin is a tiny hardware product that you can
wear on your thumb as a ring and it will make your whole palm as a gesture
interface. Fin can uniquely recognize each segments of the fingers and can
convert your palm into a numeric keypad. Fin is a Bluetooth enabled device that
we can connect to three different digital gadgets like Smartphones, Smart
TVs, Automobiles, and Home automation devices providing multiple device
compatibility. Fin reads different gestures from your palm and its
corresponding values control connected devices.  It uses smart Low Energy Technology such as Bluetooth for Communication with connected devices. Unique Features Of FIN Fin can help 285+ million visually impaired to interact with Technology Here is a video feedback from some blind people on how Fin can make their life better and to have that hope and light in the life.Where Are We Now? Where Is The Money Going?Fin is a
rare kind of product that evolved from a technology that aims at natural human
machine interaction. Fin achieves one of its goal when it goes global. To make Fin
global we need your support. It not only help us find funds for manufacturing
but also spreads a word to the world about our innovation to make our planet
a better place to live in.
To list out
what will happen to the Funds that are raised is below:


  Materials and
Designs.


  Hardware
manufacturing.


  Hardware
design.


  Funding for
materials cost.


  Adding more
enhancements to Fin like Unique User Authentication.


  Assembly.


  Platform
integration and support.


  Casing and
packaging.


  And of course
shipping!


After
funding is complete, we will immediately invest the money to the above
expenses. Updates will be sent on completion of  each stage, keeping
supporters in the loop.How Can You Support Us?FIN is now
ready to go live after our consistent hard working for over one year.
We want the Fin to be more than just a prototype, but we can't do it
alone.  Your contributions will help us make Fin, a fully finished
reality.
Fin is going live on Indiegogo because
it’s a great way to reach out to creative developers, wearable tech pioneers,
enthusiastic early adopters, and premium platforms.
We’ve
come up with hundreds of ideas for applications to integrate with Fin, but we
know that we haven’t even scratched the surface of what is possible.
We
want you,the developer,
to propel the wearable tech movement forward by creating entire new categories
of applications with Fin and complementary
technologies.
We need you,wearable tech pioneers,
to collaborate with us to provide consumers with an ever-increasing web of
tightly integrated wearable technology products that enhance productivity,
learning, and social interaction.
We
want you,the early tech
adopter, to use your influence as trend-setters to show the world the
benefits of a smarter, interactive and more connected world.

And
so we’re making available – today –for
people who are passionate about wearable technology and want to help us create
something special.Specs

Fin should come with Water-proof: IP67.


Size/Fit: Flexible.


Battery: Li Po custom battery with micro-USB charging dock ; One charge will last for 1 week; more than one year durable.


Sensors: Fin can track accurate movement of your thumb on the palm also detect each part of your finger where you are touching.


Communication: Bluetooth 2.1+ EDR and 4.0

Compatibility: Windows, MAC, iOS, Android, Windows Phones.
Use CasesThumb is accessible to anywhere in the palm and its more natural too. So wearing
a Fin will make your palm as a touch interface that enables the people to interact with Smartphones [Dial Numbers, Attending
calls, SMS, Social media, Taking Quick Notes etc.] especially for visually challenged people
since they sense the world through touch.Fin can control your smart TV, to change the channels, control sounds by mere
natural finger swipes.Fin can control your car from
being your cars key to controlling
your phone while driving, navigate
your maps, receive calls and read messages, change music, and other car
utilities just by finger swipe without even taking your hands off the
steering wheel  there by not distracting
yourself from driving.A big problem in all the
wearable devices is the input of Instructions. In the
much-Hyped
Google glass, a voice instruction and a touch
pad on devices is provided, but both the input methods are cumbersome in odd situations. Integration
with FIN will be ideal for these wearable, as FIN can control the device with much ease and
accuracy.For better entertainment experience
FIN can serve as controllers for gaming industry.Fin helps you access your Mobile utilities while jogging.Share your data with a tap of your finger.Our Prototype We will open up our FIN SDK for developers and there by paving a way to build an ecosystem,where people themselves will find new use cases for FIN. We have applied for the patent already, But we are not disclosing the whole technology now.1st Prototype:2nd Prototype: All in one3rd Prototype ,New 3D printed prototype with All in one board inside4th Prototype: Wear on Thumb

curve and is able to offer these benefits to devices on the current market and
those further behind.
Puracoat has also been tested on device speakers, and is found
to have no influence whatsoever on the effectiveness of finely-tuned acoustic
factors.

We want to put this incredible technology out there and
available for purchase. By donating a certain amount as outlined on the right,
you can have your own bottle of Puracoat to use on your devices.Even if you cannot fund us at this time, we encourage you to
share our campaign with the tools found below. If someone you know has a device
they need to protect permanently and completely, consider letting them know
about this project and what it can do for them.1) What is the capacity of 1 Puracoat?5ml per bottle.2) How many mobile phones can be coated from 1 bottle of Puracoat?1 bottle can be coated up to 4 smart Phones or an iPad with a consistent maintenance or re-coating every 3 months for a year or more depending on the usage.3) How long does the the Puracoat effect last?Puracoat for normal usage can last up to a year. However, it is advisable to re-coat once every 3 - 6 months to ensure tip top protection.4) shipping fee for multiple perks?1 shipping address requires a shipping fee of $5, unless is stated free shipping.5) How to add the shipping fees?You may select the ""forget shipping"" perk. Otherwise, just top up an additional $5 on top of the perk amount.6) When will you possibly ship the first batch?When we achieving the first 250 bottles of order on Puracoat. We will immediate arrange the posting and packaging. We experted able to complete the packaging and shipment in a week later.7) Does it affect the TouchID on iPhone 5s?No. it will not block the performance on the Touch ID sensor or even the performance of the Touch Screen.8) Can the device be submerged if the product is applied correctly?No, Water will only flow pass the device. If we submerged the device, the water pressure will force the water into device because every different device have different hole.9) Can it apply for glasses with plastic lens?Yes, it can apply to glasses with plastic lens. But some of the lens are come with existing coating, it may affect the existing coating of the lens.",7.0,0,"2 Campaigns

</div><p></p><h1>Final Hours!!!</h1><p>If you've been holding back, you're about to miss your chance. During our campaign we have hit a number of milestones and beyond what was originally promised, the following upgrades are already promised:</p><ul>
<li>Free filament for everyone. Explorer versions get one roll. Professional and Evil Scientist versions get 2 rolls</li>
<li>Carbon Fiber arms - The rods that control the effector are all carbon fiber now</li>
<li>All versions get Kysan stepper motors - yes, everyone gets Kysan motors</li>
<li>Evil Scientists versions get free dampers for the motors</li>
<li>You will get to add upgrades to your kit before it ships. If you don't want everything but (for example) wanted to add an LCD or Heated Bed, you get the chance to do so at a significantly reduced rate</li>
<li>Everyone who backs us get 5USD off on MakerLibre filament that they add to their printer..... </li>
<li>Our frames are all 100% openbeam usa frames. Also, everyone gets the choice to upgrade their frames to black.</li>
<li>If we hit $45K as our stretch goal, everyone who gets an LCD controller will get a free SD card!!!!</li>
</ul><p>---- now back to our story ---</p>Welcome back to the new and improved MakerLibre 3D Printer project page. We learned a lot from our last kickstarter and really thought about how to make a reliable, cost-effective 3D printer for the masses and we think we have the solution you've been seeking.<p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""Nuclear Green really pops in blacklight"" class=""fit lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/002/378/763/cddf7c1a8fc57208482fb2ead2aa4d91_large.JPG?1407048068"" src="""" style=""""/><figcaption>Nuclear Green really pops in blacklight</figcaption></figure><p></p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""3 of the many color options for your printer"" class=""fit lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/002/378/765/87f764fbb309d6fc220f832bf82f2e7a_large.JPG?1407048204"" src="""" style=""""/><figcaption>3 of the many color options for your printer</figcaption></figure><p></p><p>The<a href=""http://reprap.org/wiki/Kossel"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Kossel-Mini</a> printer is a wonderful, high-quality printer design that has a hundreds of users worldwide and a <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/deltabot"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">huge user community</a>. We chose to offer a Kossel-Mini rather than a new design because one of the most common problems faced by new users is where to get support when something goes wrong. If you need a part replaced or if you find a bug, it's best to have some help from people besides the manufacturer. While the Kossel-Mini has many advantages, we want to provide the following enhancements as part of this offering:</p><ul>
<li>
<b>We will only ship with the highest quality parts</b>. There are so many options for things such as hotends, controllers, motors, switches and other components. We have the experience necessary to find the best components rather than the cheap knockoffs from overseas. For example, we will not use cheap hotend knockoffs... your hotend will come from <a href=""http://hotends.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">hotends.com</a> For the upgraded kits, the stepper motors will come from Kysan and the controller board will be Panucatt Azteeg X5 mini controller. </li>
<li>
<b>We will start shipping in September 2014</b>. Most kickstarters that we see have long leadtimes before delivery. We have existing relationships and will begin shipping kits almost immediately.</li>
<li>
<b>We will document every aspect of building and tuning these marvelous printers</b>. One of the most common complaints about delta printers (and repraps in general) is that the documents are so hard to find. Every printer can have dozens of variants with little differences that can be hard to spot in the beginning. Every single printer that comes from this kickstarter will use the same parts and we will be able to tell you exactly what to do. All of the documents will come from us as either YouTube videos or blog entries (with photos) that we will save as a PDF on git (so that it will always be around). You won't have to search for anything.</li>
</ul><ul><b><i>So, what is a Kossel-Mini?</i></b></ul><ul>The Kossel-Mini is a delta 3D printer with the following design goals:</ul><ul>
<li>Zero backlash  </li>
<li>Speed: 320mm/s in X, Y and Z directions.  </li>
<li>Resolution: 80 steps/mm in all 3 directions  </li>
<li>Build Volume: 170mm diameter, 240mm height; (approx 5.5L build volume)  </li>
<li>Footprint: 300mm width  </li>

During our campaign we have hit a number of milestones and beyond what was originally promised, the following upgrades are already promised:
Free filament for everyone. Explorer versions get one roll. Professional and Evil Scientist versions get 2 rolls
Carbon Fiber arms - The rods that control the effector are all carbon fiber now
All versions get Kysan stepper motors - yes, everyone gets Kysan motors
Evil Scientists versions get free dampers for the motors
You will get to add upgrades to your kit before it ships. If you don't want everything but (for example) wanted to add an LCD or Heated Bed, you get the chance to do so at a significantly reduced rate
Everyone who backs us get 5USD off on MakerLibre filament that they add to their printer..... 
Our frames are all 100% openbeam usa frames. Also, everyone gets the choice to upgrade their frames to black.
If we hit $45K as our stretch goal, everyone who gets an LCD controller will get a free SD card!!!!
---- now back to our story ---Welcome back to the new and improved MakerLibre 3D Printer project page. We learned a lot from our last kickstarter and really thought about how to make a reliable, cost-effective 3D printer for the masses and we think we have the solution you've been seeking.Nuclear Green really pops in blacklight3 of the many color options for your printerThe Kossel-Mini printer is a wonderful, high-quality printer design that has a hundreds of users worldwide and a huge user community. We chose to offer a Kossel-Mini rather than a new design because one of the most common problems faced by new users is where to get support when something goes wrong. If you need a part replaced or if you find a bug, it's best to have some help from people besides the manufacturer. While the Kossel-Mini has many advantages, we want to provide the following enhancements as part of this offering:

We will only ship with the highest quality parts. There are so many options for things such as hotends, controllers, motors, switches and other components. We have the experience necessary to find the best components rather than the cheap knockoffs from overseas. For example, we will not use cheap hotend knockoffs... your hotend will come from hotends.com For the upgraded kits, the stepper motors will come from Kysan and the controller board will be Panucatt Azteeg X5 mini controller. 

We will start shipping in September 2014. Most kickstarters that we see have long leadtimes before delivery. We have existing relationships and will begin shipping kits almost immediately.

We will document every aspect of building and tuning these marvelous printers. One of the most common complaints about delta printers (and repraps in general) is that the documents are so hard to find. Every printer can have dozens of variants with little differences that can be hard to spot in the beginning. Every single printer that comes from this kickstarter will use the same parts and we will be able to tell you exactly what to do. All of the documents will come from us as either YouTube videos or blog entries (with photos) that we will save as a PDF on git (so that it will always be around). You won't have to search for anything.
So, what is a Kossel-Mini?The Kossel-Mini is a delta 3D printer with the following design goals:
Zero backlash  
Speed: 320mm/s in X, Y and Z directions.  
Resolution: 80 steps/mm in all 3 directions  
Build Volume: 170mm diameter, 240mm height; (approx 5.5L build volume)  
Footprint: 300mm width  
Hardware Cost: less than $600 USD
The standard Kossel-Mini with optional Viki controllerWe are using the standard Bill of Materials (BOM) including printed parts. The main reason for this is that you should be able to get replacement parts from anywhere and not be tied to any particular manufacturer. You should also be able to do upgrades later when improvements become available or if you discover your own preferences that differ from our design.Why a Kossel-Mini?  There are many printers to compare to the Kossel-Mini, but one of the most popular commercial printers today is the Replicator 5th generation:The Kossel-Mini compares favorably to the ReplicatorHow good is a Kossel-Mini?  Here are a few samples to let you see the quality of this printer.The Kossel-Mini can print with a variety of materials including Laywood (left), PLA (center) and Laybrick (right)One of these parts were printed on a Kossel-Mini and the other was printed on a Replicator. There is no distinguishable differenceA number of different useful objects can be printed on the Kossel-MiniThe Kossel-Mini is excellent at printing precision parts as well... such as gears and other mechanical partsThe Kossel-Mini supports the fine detail needed to make beautiful decorative prints.With Vapor Smoothing, your prints can look injection molded. Both parts were printed with 200 micron resolution, but the cat on the right was vapor treated for 15 minutes. We love printing in ABS for just this reason. UpgradesThe Explorer Version of the Kossel-Mini is a reliable, full-featured printer. For advanced users, a number of different upgrades are available through the Professional and Evil-Scientist versions of the kitThe Azteeg X5 32 bit integrated controllerThe mini-Viki LCD controller (for Evil Scientist Versions only)The heated bed is required to print ABS (Evil Scientist Version only)imagine this masterpiece in your evil-scientist lair. Rewards ShippingThe MakerLibre Kossel-Mini 3D Printer will ship anywhere in the world.

You have to be logged in to your Indiegogo account.


Use any of the share buttons below the campaign video or copy and share the link in the browser address bar. If anyone contributes to our campaign by using your link, you get one point.


After campaign ends, we will select 20 of the top referrers and award them with one STAGE5 dock in a color of their choice, so if at least two of your friends contribute- you could get a free STAGE5 dock. If five friends contribute- definitely a sealed deal, you are getting a free STAGE5 dock.


Let's start sharing!

Stage5 is a multifunctional dock, which supports most of the smartphones and tablets out there - all iPhones, iPads and any smartphone or tablet with a standard Micro USB port. In addition, you can listen to the music by connecting it to any other Bluetooth enabled device that plays music. Stage5 takes advantage of vibration speaker technology making any resonant surface into a high quality surface speaker which envelops the listener in immersive sound. Stage5 can be used for charging your device even if away from power supply.Designed to fit tablets and bigger size smartphones. Tablet dock works also with regular size smartphones.










•	Made of aviation grade aluminum•	Size 100mm x 90mm x 40mm•	Weight ~400-600g•	Vibration speaker 10W RMS or 20W RMS•	Bluetooth 4.0•	Touch sensitive power button• Battery 2000mAh (3200mAh upgrade optional)•	Replaceable connector tips•	Fits all iPhone, iPad models, other smartphones and tablets (connector                bottom center)•	AC/DC Power converter 100-240V to 5V 3.1A•	Standard Micro USB cable Stage5 control application adds functionality and makes Stage5 Dock even more fun and easy to use. App will be available for iOS/Android/Windows Phone.App’s features include:
Advanced features – including but not limited to auto connection, standby settings
Notifications - select the applications that are allowed to use vibration speaker for alert sounds.
Battery - shows battery charge status and allows setting at what percentage a low battery warning is displayed. Using APP you can switch between using battery for speaker and charging phone from battery (Please note, battery mainly is used for powering speaker and you may not get a full charge when charging a high capacity smartphone battery).
Profile - lets you save and load specific settings for different devices.
Equalizer - allows improving the sound by tuning different frequencies
Stage5 is made from aviation grade aluminum and it will be available in a variety of colors(clear coated glossy or bead blasted, anodized matte finish), so you can pick your favorite.The bottom side of the dock is made of micro suction rubber – it allows vibration speaker to transfer sound with greater efficiency. It also ensures that dock does not move when undocking your device. Micro suction rubber sticks to surfaces, but it won’t leave any residue when removed. The angle of the dock makes it convenient for video calls and skyping. You do not have to worry about changing the dock once you upgrade to different device as we offer a dock with multiple charger tips. It will also come in handy in case you charge various smartphones and tablets.Currently Stage5 will be available with replaceable connector types (Micro USB, Apple 30-pin and Lightning, Asus 40-pin, Samsung 30-pin). Apple connectors will be MFi certified.Vibration speaker will reveal you new and unforgettable way of listening to the music by using the surface as a speaker. Due to the output of powerful micro vibrations, Stage5 transducer energizes large areas of surfaces generating sound around the entire surface.Traditional speaker sends sound waves in a certain directionStage5 vibration transducer uses the whole surface as a speakerEvery time you change the surface, you will get a new and unique sound. It sounds equally well on wood, metal, glass, tiles and other resonant surfaces. The micro suction rubber on the bottom will not let it scratch the surface.Stage5 is equipped with low energy Bluetooth technology. You can sync it with any smartphone, tablet or Bluetooth enabled music player. It will allow for a smooth connection and the next time you use it, the link with your device will be established automatically.Stage5 can also be used when away from power supply – just put on your favourite song and place it anywhere in the room. You don’t have to worry about finding an electricity cable as Stage5 has a built-in battery allowing you to enjoy up to 3 hours of music without plugging it in. And battery can be used to charge your device as well.Stage5 is a perfect fit for your phone or tablet – docking and undocking is simple and easy. It doesn't matter if your phone has a case/cover – it will fit equally well.Stage5 has been designed with passion and
engineered with precision. Developed by an experienced team of members based in
London. At Rocket Sound Systems our product design goal is not just to be
different, but to make a real difference to the life of an everyday Stage5
user. This meant developing design specs., functions, hardware and software
from the ground up. Stage5 dock has been in development for over a year and our team has invested a lot of time and effort, as well as money, in this unique product.Currently we have made a couple of 3D printed and CNC machined prototypes and we do feel that we have found the best acoustic shape for the dock to provide an outstanding sound.June 2014

be a thing of the past.<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p>Although
Red Harbinger is a small team -  we know what we are doing.  We are everyday folks with traditional jobs,
the same as all of you - but we have the experience of globally releasing the
most complex PC case ever designed (The Cross Desk).  With only 5 employees, we have managed to
amass customers in Australia, New Zealand, Germany, Spain, UK, Canada, Mexico,
United States, Netherlands, Sweden, Singapore, and Korea and a global community
following that is MUCH larger.  We want
to continue this trend by getting fresh ideas to market - and only YOU can help
us achieve this. <br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p></p><p>Without a doubt, Red Harbinger was built by the Internet Community at large sharing our designs, ideas, and love of taking something PC cases to the extreme.  Even if
you can't assist financially, we would LOVE to have you help our cause by
sharing this project on your social media pages.</p>
<p>By sharing, you are helping a group of everyday people do our part to
continue ending routine and boring ideas. 
Routine stuff sucks.  Dopamine is
awesome - and we would really appreciate just a quick shout out to your friends
and family to show them that a veteran based company is doing their part to
make some waves.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/376651/files/20140217190522-dimensions.png?1392692722"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/376652/files/20140217190542-dimensions1.png?1392692742"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/376653/files/20140217190550-dimensions2.png?1392692750"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/376656/files/20140217190730-demo_shot.png?1392692850"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p></div>","Who is Red Harbinger?We are a veteran owned and operated group of guys from all over the

No clue what this cryptocurrency mining is all about?  No Problem!As hard as it is for us to believe sometimes, we realize that there is still a significant number of people who know very little about this subject aside from what they may have seen in news headlines.  We won't get into the myriad of benefits that cryptocurrency mining provides here, but we will say - regardless of whether you buy Dopamine or not, we'd suggest doing a bit of research on the topic to familiarize yourself if you haven't.  A bit of education is never a bad thing right?  And these days, it's very easy for an average PC user to dive right into mining and start reaping the benefits.While Dopamine was designed with scalable mining systems in mind, versatility is always a key component of Red Harbinger's cases.  With that in mind, this case can also easily be built into an open air gaming PC, a test bench for hardware testing, or any other type of PC that you can think of.  Easy access to core components makes upgrading and adding parts a breeze.What we need & what you get:In order to proceed and be successful with this product, we have to hit an acceptable price point in manufacturing so that we can offer a fair price for the quality of goods that you'll recieve.  With low production quantities, the price per unit increases. So, like every other product, more = better.As early adopters, your contributions will come at a lower-than-retail cost, and your investment will go into packaging, printing, hardware (nuts, bolts, screws, switches, grommets, etc), powder coating, manufacturing, assembly, shipping parts, tooling fees, designer costs, advertising, and distribution.  To keep things interesting, we've gathered a bit of help from some of our friends and have lined up some pretty sweet rewards, including:
A chance to hang out with the Red Harbinger crew and our friends Vanilla Ice and 3x UFC World Champion Jens Pulver while filming and live streaming the release announcement of our next product
Special early adopter pricing
Limited Edition White Dopamine cases
Discounts on purchasing multiple systems
Fully loaded turnkey Dopamine systems that are ready to be plugged in and start mining 
Custom powder coat color schemes
Special forum access on the Red Harbinger website
Access to Red Harbinger's team and products - see our products in the development stage before they are publicly announced - voice your opinions throughout the design process
Early access and options to purchase all future Limited Edition products before the general public




The Impact
By supporting Red Harbinger's Dopamine case, you are directly and indirectly assisting the mining community's growth.Your
contribution also assists the evolution of function into function and form; no
more milk crate Franken-cases or strictly utilitarian and less functional
designs.  Much like ugly 90’s websites
that “did the job” and glittery blinged out Myspace pages, we'd like those to
be a thing of the past.Although
Red Harbinger is a small team -  we know what we are doing.  We are everyday folks with traditional jobs,
the same as all of you - but we have the experience of globally releasing the
most complex PC case ever designed (The Cross Desk).  With only 5 employees, we have managed to
amass customers in Australia, New Zealand, Germany, Spain, UK, Canada, Mexico,
United States, Netherlands, Sweden, Singapore, and Korea and a global community
following that is MUCH larger.  We want
to continue this trend by getting fresh ideas to market - and only YOU can help
us achieve this. Other Ways You Can HelpWithout a doubt, Red Harbinger was built by the Internet Community at large sharing our designs, ideas, and love of taking something PC cases to the extreme.  Even if
you can't assist financially, we would LOVE to have you help our cause by
sharing this project on your social media pages.
By sharing, you are helping a group of everyday people do our part to
continue ending routine and boring ideas. 
Routine stuff sucks.  Dopamine is
awesome - and we would really appreciate just a quick shout out to your friends
and family to show them that a veteran based company is doing their part to
make some waves.",14.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>How does it work?</h2>

The Swedish Adrenaline Power Meter is the only
power meter using the RSG (Resonant String Gauge) technology. This means that
the sensing element is passive with no need for electrical power and can easily be integrated into a bicycle pedal. The problem that traditional
sensors have with high costs and unstable functions can therefore be avoided. <br/><br/>
The RSG technology works a bit like an electric guitar. The string is attached
to the axle inside the pedal. The transceiver electronics operate with high
frequency microwaves and is placed in the pedal. When the axle is bent, ever so
little, the string frequency is changed. This is picked up by the transceiver which
translates this induced power and sends it to the ANT+ or Bluetooth Smart<sup>®</sup>
cycle computer. <br/><br/></span><h2><span class=""notranlsate""></span></h2><span class=""notranlsate""><p>

that is dedicated to helping people make their dreams become a reality.  Our project is the Pro Lottery Mills App for
your phone, iPad, or tablet.  We are
bringing lottery science to life, in a quick, easy, Google-Play format, so that
the average lottery player can now have a better chance at success.  
How many success stories have been told over the years about
the person who was unemployed, down on their luck, and with one last gasp of
hope…bought a lottery ticket?  They took
one last shot, at a chance, to live a dream. 
How many people could use some help trying to pay their bills, keep
their cars, or even their homes?  This
App is for countless gamers to use just for fun.  But it is also a way for the more serious
lottery player to try to get an upper hand. 
With this App, you can check lottery results, find frequency of used
numbers, and obtain rankings of the most popular “Pick 3” and “Pick 4” winning
lottery combinations.  With this App, you
can get instant notifications of your winning numbers, so you can keep up on
what is working and what is not.  The user
can save their history of numbers played, and winning numbers, to establish
further trends and probabilities.  You
can even use this App to share your winnings on Facebook.

The deeply awesome users of www.gmap-pedometer.com did it! I'll post pictures of the Macbook Air to this campaign site as soon as I have it! Supersonic thank-you buttslaps all around! 
The www.gmap-pedometer.com Story

I am the one-man coder/proprietor of www.gmap-pedometer.com. The site is a tool that allows cardio freaks (such as myself) to track the distance they have run or cycled on a google map interface. I get over a million visits a month from all over the world. 

This functionality cries out to be a mobile app as well. I have a development environment set up, and coding is underway. However the greatest limitation is time. This site is still a side project, and what's it's on the side of is a busy family life (three kids ages 8 and under) and 9-5 (really 6) job.

LIONPAW
keyboard is based on a
comprehensive analysis
of the motions
of the human body when typing. The keys are arranged in such a way that the most frequently used keys are grouped together in the centre (black caps) and users primarily move their hands forward and backward across the keyboard when typing, instead of haphazardly. This revolutionary keyboard eliminates uncomfortable wrist movements and fingers-overstretch,
radically revamping keyboard design for more advanced ergonomics.
   



With Lionpaw keyboard, you can:
-avoid uncomfortable wrist turning and risk of repetitive wrist strain injury 
-experience less finger fatigue when typing
-touch-type instinctively, skipping arduous and complex touch-typing courses
-experience
intuitive simplicity of an interface designed to provide natural
comfort to your hands




The video and photos on this campaign page show the prototype that we used to develop an improved model for production. The keyboard model that will be shipped to our backers will contain all the advertised features with improvements over the prototype. In other words, what you will get is even better than what you see here!
ADDITIONAL INFO FOR KEYBOARD ENTHUSIASTS:


86 keys in split keyboard! LIONPAW keyboard is a set of two separate halves, one half for the left hand and one half for the right hand. Each half features two sections and consists of 31 standard-size keycaps for your palm fingers and 12 double-length keycaps for your thumbs, making a total of 86 keys on the keyboard. (The prototype in the video and photos features one-and-a-half length keycaps, which will be changed to more elongated double-length keycaps for more comfortable user experience in the shipped keyboard model.)
Mechanical
key
switches!
We
plan to ship LIONPAW keyboards
with “Brown” (non-clicky)
mechanical
keys with tactile feedback
that
makes each
of your
fingertips clearly feel the click inside each key when pressed.
In
choosing
the keyswitch manufacturer, we
are
mindful of our
supporters' best interests, and
we
are fully
aware that
this keyboard is an investment for computer users who spend long
hours at their computers.
No
more boring shining dots for lock keys! The
LIONPAW keyboard amazingly features hard-wired seven-segment LED
displays as
lock key indicators, and
additional
LEDs to guide the user in the peripheral vision. The seven-segment
LED displays that come in two colors complete this keyboard's sci-fi
industrial design while being purely functional to indicate lock key
modes: ""C"" for Caps Lock on, ""S"" for Scroll Lock
on, ""0."" for Num Lock on.


USB

Nylon-braided USB cables included!
We have already included a 3ft/1m-long nylon-braided USB cables with every LIONPAW
keyboard we ship, which you can use immediately while you shop for your ideal cables.


Unique
industrial design keyboard
body! With
sufficient backer numbers, this keyboard will be delivered to backers
with the
keyboard
bodies
made of injection-molded plastic. If backer demand is lower than

<p>Hello Indiegogoers! Meet Ditto, our very own Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF for short) 3D Printer. Building upon existing 3D printer kits, Ditto was designed from the ground up to be an innovative and user-friendly printer for both new and experienced users alike.</p>
<p>So what exactly makes Ditto unique? Well for one, Ditto features a large and open work space unlike any other, allowing sizable prints to be produced with ease. The joy of use you get from tinkering with Ditto is a truly remarkable experience. The affordability is also unparalleled considering the package you’re getting. The list could go on, but the bottom line is that Ditto is one awesome printer. You have our word for it!</p>
<p><img alt=""main ditto"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://tinkerines.com/images/Main_Ditto.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""main ditto""/></p>
<div>
<h3><img alt=""ditto and you"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.tinkerines.com/images/Ditto_and_you.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Ditto and You""/></h3>
<p>So what can you print with a 3D printer like Ditto? Just about anything! From creating custom game board pieces to functional gears for a machine, 3D printing allows you to quickly create solid plastic objects from a digital file. You can select from premade files on an online database such as Thingiverse or create your own with free modelling software such as Google SketchUp. Learning to create has never been easier!</p>
<p><br/>Aside from being a great household electronic, Ditto is great for educational purposes. While the concept of putting together a 3D printer from scratch may seem daunting to novice users, there has never been a greater opportunity for you and your friends to get together and collaboratively assemble, tweak, and produce usable objects with a machine. The fun doesn’t stop there! As open source hardware, Ditto is open for revision and improvement by members of the 3D printer community; personalize your printers, share your designs, or expand upon the works of others to help Ditto evolve with time.</p>

</div>
<p>So this is the part where we need your help. Over the past few months, we have devoted much time and energy into developing Ditto. During the process, we have designed many iterations of prototypes, completed a series of testing phases, and established a strong relationship with our suppliers. As we approach this final stage of delivering Ditto to the public, we need all your support to make this dream of ours a possibility. <br/><br/>In order to bring the cost of producing each printer down, we need to fill a sizeable order from our supplier. Your funding will help us drive down the cost of each individual part while helping us assure that our printer is produced with the utmost rigorous quality.</p>
<p><img alt=""the future"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.tinkerines.com/images/future.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""The Future""/></p>
<p>We plan to use the funding from this campaign to first fufill all of the orders we have received and then continue developing new and exciting 3D technologies and make them available to YOU. 3D printing should no longer be an exclusive novelty; we believe that every household and school can benefit greatly from owning a 3D printer, whether you are new to the 3D printing scene or a Tinkering veteran.</p>
<p>So pledge toward our cause today and become part of the 3D printing revolution!</p>

<p>We're organizing the Internet Ungovernance Forum on September 4-5, for people who demand that fundamental freedoms,
    openness, unity and net neutrality remain the building blocks of the Internet. Our ambition is to talk about the
    real problems of the internet, how we can solve these and to chart a path for action.
</p>
<p>
    Our forum will be in parallel to the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) 2014 which will also be held in Istanbul
    between September 2-5. Interested parties all around the world will join and follow this important event. We see
    that at IGF the most urgent problems of the Internet do not get the right attention. Due to the
    ""multi-stakeholderism"" format, the main perpetrators of many of the Internet's problems, governments and
    corporations, are getting representation in IGF they don’t deserve. Given these circumstances, we decided to take
    initiative to defend the Internet as we know it and to create a space to raise the voices of civil society
    initiatives, activists and common people. <br/></p>
<p>
    For us, the most vital problems today are censorship and freedom of speech; surveillance and privacy; excessive
    commercialization and super-monopolies; protective, prohibitionist and conservative governance approaches; awful
    governance examples as in the case of Turkey and the list goes on. Further, we do not see any of these problems
    independent of the greater political, social and economic contexts in which the Internet and related digital
    infrastructures are embedded in. We call on our participants to resist seeing the problems of the Internet as only
    technological and void of its materiality. We want to reclaim the Internet as a fundamental infrastructure of our
    societies, cities, education, health, work, media, communications, culture and everyday activities.
</p>
<p>
    Today, it is more imminent than ever to strengthen networks of solidarity and connect struggles across the globe for
    the Internet we want. For this we envision the Ungovernance Forum to be a space in which we can discuss the problems
    and solutions of the Internet openly, with courage, and without shying away from conflict. To develop the program of
    the forum we have relied on our powerful but inevitably limited existing networks. We therefore invite all of you to
    use this event to expand our collective imagination and circuits of action.
</p>
<p>
    As Alternative Informatics Association, we underline the necessity of the Internet as a free, equal and basic human
    right and regard it as fundamental to struggles of justice. If you want a free, secure and open Internet and you’re
    fighting for it, we ask you to join and support us at the Internet Ungovernance Forum in Istanbul!
</p>
<h3>What do we need? </h3>
<p>To boost participating, especially Turkish activists, we need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simultaneous interpretation Turkish - English and English - Turkish which costs $2400</li>
<li>Printing some materials for wider announcements which costs $400</li>
</ul>
<p>By this campaign we aim to get money only for these two purposes. We 
covered other expenses with our own resources and supporter NGO's

<p>4-5 Eylül'de yapılacak olan Internet Ungovernance Forum'u, temel hak ve özgürlüklerin, açıklığın birlikteliğin ve ağ
    tarafsızlığının internetin yapı taşları olarak kalmasını isteyenler için organize ediyoruz. İsteğimiz, internetin şu
    an sahip olduğu ciddi problemler hakkında konuşmak, bunları nasıl çözeceğimizi bulmak ve eyleme geçmek için bir yol
    çizmek.

</p>
<p>
    Forumumuz, yine 2-5 Eylül tarihleri arasında İstanbul'da yapılacak olan Internet Governance Forum (IGF) 2014 ile eş
    zamanlı olarak gerçekleşecek. Dünyanın dört bir yanından gelen katılımcılar bu önemli etkinliğe iştirak edecek.
    Bizler, internetin en önemli sorunlarının IGF'de hakettiği ilgiyi göremediğini fark ettik. Etkinliğin
    “Multi-stakeholderism” yapısı yüzünden, internetin sahip olduğu problemlerin çoğunun asıl müsebbibi olan devlet ve
    şirketler, IGF'de gereğinden fazla temsil edilmekte. Bu yüzden bizler de, interneti savunmak ve sivil toplum
    örgütlerinin, aktivistlerin ve halkın da seslerini duyurabilecekleri bir alan yaratmak için önayak olmaya karar
    verdik.
</p>
<p>
    Bizim için en hayati sorunlar; sansür ve ifade özgürlüğü, gözetim ve mahremiyet, aşırı ticarileşme ve süper
    tekeller, korumacı, yasakçı, muhafazakar yaklaşımlar ve Türkiye'de de tanık olduğumuz korkunç yönetişim
    örneklerinden oluşuyor. Bizler bu problemleri internet ve diğer dijital altyapıların bütünleşmiş olduğu siyasi,
    sosyal ve ekonomik bağlamlardan bağımsız olarak değerlendirmiyoruz. Katılımcılarımızdan da, internetin sorunlarını
    sadece teknoloji kaynaklı görmemelerini, zira bu tür bir bakış açısının sorunların çok da önemli değilmiş gibi
    algılanmasına yol açabileceğini bilmelerini istiyoruz. Bizler interneti toplumumuzun, şehirlerin, eğitimin,
    sağlığın, iş, medya, iletişim, kültür ve günlük aktivitlerin temel altyapısı olarak yeniden yapılandırmak istiyoruz.
</p>
<p>
    Artık, istediğimiz interneti yaratabilmek için tüm dünyada dayanışma ağlarını güçlendirmek ve birlikte mücadele
    etmek kaçınılmaz hale gelmiştir. Bu yüzden, Ungovernance Forum'u internetin sorun ve çözümlerini cesurca, hiçbir
    şeyi saklamadan ve tartışmaktan kaçınmadan konuşabileceğimiz bir etkinlik olarak hayal ettik.Forumun programını
    oluşturmak için, sahip olduğumuz güçlü, fakat sınırlı çevremizi kullandık. Bu yüzden sizleri, bu etkinliği kolektif
    hayalgücümüzü ve eylem taktiklerimizi geliştirmekte kullanmaya davet ediyoruz.
</p>
<p>
    Bizler, Alternatif Bilişim Derneği olarak, internetin herkesin temel hakkı olduğunu, özgür ve eşit olması
    gerektiğini ve hak mücadelesi için elzem olduğunu düşünüyoruz. Eğer siz de özgür, güvenli ve açık bir internet
    istiyor ve bunun için mücadele ediyorsanız, sizlerden Internet Ungovernance Forum'a mümkün olduğunca katkı sunmanızı
    ve destek olmanızı istiyoruz.

Getting back your power as a consumer may feel weird at first, but it’s addictive.  And getting on a fair and appropriate plan can only mean good for the industry, consumers and our pocketbooks.  When customers don’t feel ripped off they start to develop warm feelings for their providers. </p>

“[For data plans, Americans] pay three times the European average of $2.50 and more  than 10 times what consumers pay in Sweden, where a gigabyte costs as little as 63  cents.“ Kevin O’Brien, New York Times“Canadian cellphone rates among world's worst” Peter Nowak, CBC.ca


Today North Americans pay some of the highest prices for cell service in the world. We pay for more services than we use and plan pricing isn’t clear as day. Bottom line is today, 75% of us are paying more than we should for plans we don’t understand. It’s time for change. 




Become a beta tester: http://www.bit.ly/snoobe  and don’t forget to support us!


""A decision helping tool"", M. Lessard, Radio-Canada
""Snoobe mets le doigt sur un réel problème"", J. Brault, Les Affaires
""Help to find the ideal plan"", M. Johnson, Metro Journal
""The Expedia of the mobile world"", H. Rakotomalala, Montreal Tech Watch
""Mobile plan selection based on facts, not impressions"", J-F Coderre, La Presse






Snoobe tracks plans and prices for all North American letting mobile customers see the available plans that match their actual usage in real-time (soon for European countries).
Next, Snoobe analyzes user data usage and proposes cheaper and better alternatives from all the available plans in their area.
Snoobe doesn’t stop once the savings start. The app continues to hunt for better, more competitive plans and alerts users when it’s time to switch.  No more guess work, no more head scratching, just clear and transparent pricing across all of the competition. 
WANT PROOF? Snoobe is already saving Beta testers on average $300 per year: 
Try the beta app for FREE!
With your support and participation you’ll help Snoobe show mobile carriers and resellers that consumers are smart, savvy price conscious people who deserve fair and transparent pricing, period.



If you’ve ever choked at the sight of your cell phone bill; if you think it’s time to demand better and more affordable services from carriers; if you think we should stop complaining and actually do something we urge you to join the cause.
By supporting the Snoobe team with your pledge you can help change the face of the wireless industry!
All contributions will go directly toward the final stage development of our application - the ability to switch carriers easily anywhere in the world. With over 1 billion smart phone subscribers in the world, that’s a lot of people saving a lot of money. 
As a member of the Snoobe movement, we will add your name to our wall of believers - people who think getting fairer and affordable mobile services is only right and fair. You will also be front and center on new Snoobe features, lending your voice and vote on which plans and carriers we should add next. What’s more you’ll get special invites to share with your friends and family so they can join the cause.
But most importantly of course, by contributing you will also be one of the first people to get the full Premium app and start saving. This doesn’t hold true because you can be one of the first to use it without being a backer.







We are stronger together. By sharing Snoobe with your friends, family and co-workers on your favorite social networks and asking them to contribute, you become part of the mission to help protect and empower consumers like you and change the face of the mobile industry:

It’s exactly that dynamic that gave birth to the legend of Robin Hood and exactly what we hope to embody. Getting back your power as a consumer may feel weird at first, but it’s addictive.  And getting on a fair and appropriate plan can only mean good for the industry, consumers and our pocketbooks.  When customers don’t feel ripped off they start to develop warm feelings for their providers. 
Each month about 4 million wireless customers in the US switch providers. Giving those customers a clear shot at the best plans available will, we hope change all that. 















If the crowdfunding campaign is successful, we are planning to launch our Android app in December. We currently have a functional prototype and many satisfied early users. We are aiming to finish development by completing more quality tests, adding more plans, and making sure the application lives up to your expectations.",31.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>What Is CommBadge™?</h2>

<h2><img alt=""Women using Siri Handsfree in the Kitchen"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://images.gizmag.com/gallery_lrg/commbadge_indie_go_go-3.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Women using Siri Handsfree in the Kitchen""/></h2>
<h2>The Background</h2>
</div>
<p>Technology has finally caught up with the science fiction that was first imagined by Gene Roddenberry in Star Trek The Next Generation and it was called <em>combadge</em>. Finally, there is a real CommBadge, it's a miniature speakerphone with big sound. It utilizes Bluetooth Low Energy (4.0) to pair with your iPhone or Android smartphone. CommBadge measures only 1.5"" (39 mm) in diameter.</p>
<h2><strong>Why Not Just Wear a Bluetooth Headset Instead?</strong></h2>
<div>
<p>I don’t know about you but I personally hate wearing a Bluetooth headset. I’ve tried tons of them, and they are all uncomfortable or annoying to me. However, holding your phone while busy at work or doing household chores is a pain. For many situations using a speakerphone is a better solution, and the only way to truly multitask. For example, cooking, walking the two dogs, home projects, and the list goes on.</p>
<p>So I started thinking. Why can’t I just wear a speakerphone? I did some online research and I couldn’t find anything! Then, about a year ago I started prototyping and experimenting with placement and functionality. The more I tested it in various environments, some being very noisy, the more I was blown away. Why hasn’t anyone done this I thought? So I formed a team of five to build a real CommBadge.</p>
<p>With today’s noise canceling technology wearing a speakerphone totally makes sense. It’s super convenient and really great with Siri too. Put your iPhone away, and you can still access Siri from a distance of up to 30 meters!</p>
<h2>Can Everyone Around Me Hear My Conversation?</h2>
<p>The answer is no! One of the most important features of CommBadge, albeit the most time-consuming aspect of it's engineering, is the technology behind the speaker enclosure or ""cabinet"". Speaker cabinet design is a complex mixture of art and science.</p>
<p>In order to get crystal clear sound to the user, the enclosure is designed to prevent sound waves generated by the rearward-facing surface of the diaphragm of an open driver interacting with sound waves generated at the front of the driver. SORRY, what this all means is that we designed CommBadge so the clean sound waves reach the user, but the sound waves that travel beyond a foot or so from the users ears are scrambled. Therefore, someone near you can tell you are on a call, and not directly speaking to them, but they cannot discern the other end of your conversation. Thus, preventing that public Bluetooth headset syndrome of ""are you talking to me?"" in the supermarket line.</p>
<p><a href=""http://youtu.be/HNSQ9AUfB2E"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Personalized Speaker Technology"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/551812/pictures/full/20121124060726-Untitled.png?1353766051"" src="""" style="""" title=""Personalized Speaker Technology""/></a></p>
<p>Who cares anyway? Technology can sometimes seem quirky until it becomes ubiquitous. Nevertheless we solved this, with one quick tap you can transfer the call back to your smartphone.</p>
<p>Furthermore, most people are required to wear an identification badge while at work. A lot of people use badge reels for their access convenience. That’s how the CommBadge came to life, combining an ID badge reel and a tiny speakerphone. It’s always with you, and great for lunch breaks, etc. After work, simply remove your ID badge and it becomes your personal assistant. The uses are truly limitless; and you’ll be hands-free in your car if your car is not Bluetooth equipped. Once you start using it you’ll never go back to a Bluetooth headset. Science Fiction has now become a reality!</p>

<h2>CommBadge's Wireless Tether Feature</h2>
<p>                           <img alt=""Wireless Tether Feature"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/536653/pictures/full/20121113142413-CommbadgeLockScreen.jpg?1352845456"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: top;"" title=""Wireless Tether Feature""/></p>
<h2>What We Need and What You Get!</h2>
<p>The CommBadge demoed in the above video is an actual working pre-production model. CommBadge is beyond the prototype stage. After dozens of CAD redesigns, and over a dozen 3D printed prototypes we have finally nailed the design. We are ready for production! With your support, we can bring a real CommBadge to the world three centuries early!</p>
<p>While we have finalized the design for production, your contribution will move it from a functional pre-production model, to a finished commercial product. The CommBadge will require a number of manufacturing processes like final PCB design verification and then fabrication, as well as injection molding and stamping, all of which are very costly initially, which is why we're here on Indiegogo. Once the project ends in late-December, we will begin production testing shortly thereafter. We plan on partnering with <a href=""http://www.dragoninnovation.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dragon Innovation</a>, experts with facilitating all aspects of product design, production, and fulfillment. We will be posting regular updates and contributors will be able to get an inside look at our progress. CommBadge can be worn in many ways. Also, it was engineered to replace your daily corporate ID badge reel with a badge reel plus micro-sized speakerphone that's a wearable designer device.</p>
<p>For our Indiegogo launch we will be offering it in three configurations. The first package will include one low profile CommBadge Classic (no ID badge holder) that you can wear for personal use. The second package will include one low profile CommBadge that you can wear and display your corporate ID badge in a thin and light configuration. The third package is the CommBadge<strong>+</strong>, the ""<strong>+</strong>"" adds a built-in retractable ID badge reel. Wear it just like you do your current corporate ID badge reel; either on your collar, shirt pocket, or hanging on a lanyard. After fulfillment, other accessories are in the works.</p>

Thus, preventing that public Bluetooth headset syndrome of ""are you talking to me?"" in the supermarket line.

Who cares anyway? Technology can sometimes seem quirky until it becomes ubiquitous. Nevertheless we solved this, with one quick tap you can transfer the call back to your smartphone.
Furthermore, most people are required to wear an identification badge while at work. A lot of people use badge reels for their access convenience. That’s how the CommBadge came to life, combining an ID badge reel and a tiny speakerphone. It’s always with you, and great for lunch breaks, etc. After work, simply remove your ID badge and it becomes your personal assistant. The uses are truly limitless; and you’ll be hands-free in your car if your car is not Bluetooth equipped. Once you start using it you’ll never go back to a Bluetooth headset. Science Fiction has now become a reality!

CommBadge's Wireless Tether Feature
                           
What We Need and What You Get!
The CommBadge demoed in the above video is an actual working pre-production model. CommBadge is beyond the prototype stage. After dozens of CAD redesigns, and over a dozen 3D printed prototypes we have finally nailed the design. We are ready for production! With your support, we can bring a real CommBadge to the world three centuries early!
While we have finalized the design for production, your contribution will move it from a functional pre-production model, to a finished commercial product. The CommBadge will require a number of manufacturing processes like final PCB design verification and then fabrication, as well as injection molding and stamping, all of which are very costly initially, which is why we're here on Indiegogo. Once the project ends in late-December, we will begin production testing shortly thereafter. We plan on partnering with Dragon Innovation, experts with facilitating all aspects of product design, production, and fulfillment. We will be posting regular updates and contributors will be able to get an inside look at our progress. CommBadge can be worn in many ways. Also, it was engineered to replace your daily corporate ID badge reel with a badge reel plus micro-sized speakerphone that's a wearable designer device.
For our Indiegogo launch we will be offering it in three configurations. The first package will include one low profile CommBadge Classic (no ID badge holder) that you can wear for personal use. The second package will include one low profile CommBadge that you can wear and display your corporate ID badge in a thin and light configuration. The third package is the CommBadge+, the ""+"" adds a built-in retractable ID badge reel. Wear it just like you do your current corporate ID badge reel; either on your collar, shirt pocket, or hanging on a lanyard. After fulfillment, other accessories are in the works.

Frequently Asked Questions


FAQ: What is CommBadge? CommBadge is a next generation Bluetooth wireless speakerphone that is wearable. CommBadge is not a traditional Bluetooth headset!!! CommBadge attaches to your clothing quickly and securely. Additionally, CommBadge combines the ID badge reel you may currently be required to wear by your employer with a handsfree speakerphone.

FAQ: Can I use Siri? Yes, Siri works better with CommBadge! Access Siri handsfree around the house while your iPhone is in it's charger!

What about iOS 6 and iPhone 5? No problem, CommBadge was designed to work seamlessly with IOS 6. ALL iPhone's with IOS 4.0 and later will work with CommBadge.

FAQ: How do I wear CommBadge? CommBadge is a 39 mm diameter module that is less than 14 mm thick (before speaker dome)! It will come complete with everything you need for handsfree communication with your smartphone. The Indiegogo launch will include either the CommBadge Classic, CommBadge, or the CommBadge+ with ID Badge Reel (only adds 5 mm to the thickness), and all include a micro-USB charging cable.

FAQ: Can I run and jog with CommBadge? Yes, the clip has a secondary locking mechanism that will more than support the weight of the CommBadge without slipping or detaching.

FAQ: How do I wear CommBadge with my corporate ID Badge? The same way!!! It will clip to your shirt pocket, collar, or lanyard just like your old ID badge reel.

FAQ: How much weight does it add to my ID badge reel? CommBadge's components add less than two grams, so the weight difference is negligible

FAQ: What if I don't need an ID badge holder or reel? Great, just purchase the CommBadge Classic, it's a sleek minimalist design that's 5 mm thinner than the badge reel model.

FAQ: Can the ""gray"" securing clasp be removed? Yes, if you want to use velcro, magnets, etc., just unscrew and remove the clasp with a small phillips screwdriver.

FAQ: What is Bluetooth Smart? Bluetooth Smart also known as 4.0, enables devices to be continuously connected but with extremely low battery drain. CommBadge will last about a full day on a single charge with average use. Stand-by time is even longer.

FAQ: How do I charge it? Use the included micro-USB cable to connect to USB or a power supply

FAQ: How do I pair it to my iPhone or Android smartphone? Just like any late model Bluetooth headset. It takes less than a minute. You only have to do this once.

FAQ: What if I forget to take my smartphone with me while I’m wearing my CommBadge? CommBadge will alert you when you get a predetermined distance from your smartphone. You can adjust the range, warning tone, and vibration settings in the FREE to download iPhone and Android app.*

FAQ: Will my iPhone or Android phone detect if I forget to take my CommBadge with me? Yes, the CommBadge app works with iPhone and Android Notifications and will alert you when you get beyond the predetermined distance away from the CommBadge.*

FAQ: Where do I find the app? You can download it for free from the App Store or Google Play directly on your phone (coming soon).

But for these needs there are Klips plus. They are bigger, more powerful and they can solve problems much more difficult!    Do you want to multiply the benefit of Klips several times? Then hold the Dock! It will help you to organize your work and personal space much better. It’s made of magnetic stainless steel and can be attached to any flat surface thanks to a micro-suction tape. This will allow it to be fixed multiple times!    Klips is a unique accessory. There are still a huge number of ways to use the basic ones. Klips - a keychain, a magnet on the fridge for notes, a pencil case, a paper clip and even a curtain for the web camera! And the most important thing - the number of these methods is limited only by imagination!    Your time is your most valuable resource. This is the most essential argument in favor of Klips. According to our calculations, if you spend 10 minutes a day on unraveling your headphones, you lose at least 3 days of your life per year. But if you use Klips, this action will take about a second and a few seconds to stack them. Then you will spend about 24 minutes a year. Choosing Klips, you get more free time on things that are really important.      There are a lot of things in the world that make life easier for us. Such trifles like a bottle opener, different instruments, a lighter or even a needle - at the very right moment they are not by your side. But you can always rely on Klips. They are always at hand.     Just put them on and in a minute you will forget that they are on you. At the right time they will come for help!    Klips glow in the dark! This is one of the coolest things in our organizer. Thanks to the paint developed by us to cut the skin, Klips can accumulate daylight and glow in the dark.     This function can be very useful when you are looking for an item with Klips in a poorly lit place!      The main material of Klips is an Italian high-quality leather of two kinds and thicknesses.They are selected in such a way that the organizer will not be arbitrarily closed by magnets. Furthermore, to close Klips minimal human intervention is required.     The inner leather is thinner, in order to retain the force of the magnet cohesion and create a bulge for a better contact. The second is several times thicker for the strength and durability of the outer layer of Klips. High-quality magnets are placed between the layers of leather.    We also got rid of stitches! But don’t worry! This is absolutely reliable due to proper pressure bonding. Instead, this method allows to use magnets of a larger diameter and, correspondingly, the force of the cohesion without increasing the area of ​​the accessory!     The palette of Klips colors consists of brown, beige, gray and black. And since our organizer is bicolor, we decided to call Klips according to the external color of the skin.     We hope this won’t confuse anyone. And if you have any questions, feel free to send them to us! Isn’t it true that two-color Klips look great ?!",32.0,0,"1 Campaign

AllBe1 will connect to your smartphone via a unique application that will allow you to communicate with it and set the various actions you need it to do for you in your day to day activities. 
 

AllBe1 is the perfect personal guardian. Thanks to its multiple sensors it can ensure you, your family, and your belongings a better sense of security for an affordable price.
AllBe1 your guardian
 

AllBe1 your family guardian

AllBe1 guards your belongings
  

With its advanced infrared technology, AllBe1 will alert you when someone enters your home or office uninvited, directly to your smartphone. No one will be able to get by  you without you knowing about it! 
AllBe1 can help you find your valuable belongings when you’ve lost or misplaced them by directing you to their location so that you will always know where they are.
 

AllBe1 will alert you once your belongings have been touched or misplaced when out of your reach. Once the silent alarm is triggered the app will send you an alert to your smartphone.
 

 
You can place AllBe1 inside a drawer, and set it to send your smartphone an alert, whenever the drawer is opened in your absence.
 

 
Once you activate the AllBe1 app in your smartphone, you can set it to unlock or lock by itself, without the need for a password. The smart lock will activate according to your proximity, so if you are far away from your smartphone it cannot be opened by anyone else.
 
AllBe1 will detect motion changes in any given area, and alert you directly to your smartphone. This will allow you to protect your home or office, even when you are not there. If you place the AllBe1 in your car, for instance, it will alert you if anyone bumps into or moves it in your absence.

 

AllBe1 will count your steps, distance, and calories and then calculate the data, according to your personal physical parameters. AllBe1 will also send this information directly to your smartphone app.
 

AllBe1 will alert you whenever your body needs more sun exposure. You will receive this important information directly to your smartphone and be notified when it is time to spend some time in the sun.
 

If you find yourself in danger, AllBe1 can be used as a smart button with a preset number that it will alert with your GPS location once activated. With AllBe1, you will be safe no matter where you go.
 

Use AllBe1 to monitor your baby's room temperature and get an immediate alert to your smartphone if it gets too hot or cold.
 

Once in the sun, AllBe1 will notify you when it is time to protect your skin with additional sunscreen. This option will help you protect your children from the dangerous outcomes of excessive sun exposure.
 


Children have so much energy and just love to run around, sometimes it is very hard to keep track of them. Once AllBe1 is placed inside your child's pocket, it will monitor his or her movement, and send an alert directly to your smartphone once they leave your “safe zone”.
 


When AllBe1 is attached to your pet’s collar you will be able to keep track of them, in case they run away or go missing. Finding your lost pet has never been so easy.
 
 



 
You can attach AllBe1 to your t-shirt or pocket, wear it like a watch on your wrist or hang it around your neck on a necklace. This way AllBe1 will always be with you, wherever you go!  


AllBe1 can be placed on your computer, inside your drawer, on your child or pet and on a shelf with it’s designated holder. AllBe1 will guard you indoors and out. 



 



 

You can wear it, strap it on your wrist, attach it to your pet, your child and many other options. With AllBe1 accessories, you will have even more ways that will help you guard and protect the things dearest to you.
