Set in a fantasy dream of one of our monkey characters from the upcoming Banana Conspiracy it pulls you in a colorful and fun world of apes obsessed with space traveling and of course... bananas.</p>

<p class=""western"" lang=""hr-BA"" style=""margin-bottom: 0.35cm;"">As a part of a bizarre space program our monkey hero is sent to space in a rocket ship to collect as much bananas as possible on his way to the sun. The premise of whole monkey civilization, their technology and society is based around belief that the whole sun is yellow because it’s made of bananas. The only way to get there is by rocket and our monkey is following his “yellow brick road”. The game itself is sort of a presentation that main boss monkey is presenting to it's minions; how to get to the sun and what to expect from a space traveling from the monkey's point of view. Players will choose a specific mission by spining the wheel of fortune before the game. Your goal is to navigate the monkey spaceship on it's way to the sun. The rocket is powered by fire crackers, stars and planets are hanging from the ceiling and space is a giant theater. Both visual and sound styles are influenced by the fifties, atom-punk rendered with UPA-e &amp; Hanna Barbera cartoons and it's a part of the larger universe that we want to explore and expand in our sequel Banana Conspiracy.</p>

<p>...wait! Please don't leave yet! I said <i>simple</i>, not easy. This wasn't a casual decision. If it were, why would the company be called <b>GOTY</b>? It would've been called <i>Gamers Oppose Tart Yogurt</i>. no offense to tart. or yogurt. and no harm meant to any organization called that. They've already been thoroughly punished.</p>

<p>Hi, I'm Henry! Founder and CEO of <b>GOTY LLC</b>, a dedicated Awards Company for Interactive Entertainment. Our goal is to celebrate and award video games as <b>Works of Art</b>, for both the studios and their communities. Nominees and Winners are determined through Critic &amp; Player voting, industry opinion, and numerous x-factors.</p>
<p>Now the guideline said to talk about myself. I suppose this is used to build empathy and show capability to you, the contributor. I'd rather just give you a whole bunch of stuff as a thank you, but the suggestion-man threatened my caffeine. Sorry guys :'(</p>

<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Because you know. I was a foolish toddler. </span><br/>

<h4><b>The GOTY Campaign</b></h4>
</div><div>This project, this company. It was designed with two groups in mind. The studios who craft amazing work every year, and the dedicated community who enjoys that work. </div><div>I cannot emphasize enough the power of this community. You commit so much, yet are constantly burdened by inferior productions. Organizations that review games, award them, represent them; they should be the same quality as the titles themselves, and should be a reliable resource for this community to utilize.</div><div>We stress quality and fairness more than anything else. Awards selections should be based on the collective opinion of the entire industry, not just a select few ""specialists"". At the same time, ceremonies should effectively honor the winning Titles and their Respective Studios.</div><div>

<li>
<u>2nd Filter</u> - user/critic ratings that vary each year, designed to isolate out titles that are <i><b>Great</b></i>
</li>
<li>
<u>Exceptions</u> - unique conditions with certain titles that allows them to qualify for specialized awards when they otherwise might not (e.g. Best Art Direction)</li>
<li>
<u>Finalists</u> - the top two dozen titles are determined, in which the entire industry can vote on who they individually think deserves a nomination</li>
<li>
<u>Nominees</u> - the top titles in each category move on to receive a nomination during the awards show</li>
<li>
<u>Winners</u> - here votes serve as final tie breakers or confirmation for winners. It is quite common for both user and critic votes to tie. This where x-factors are incorporated, often in significant amounts in order to confirm a winner.</li>

<h3>What We Need</h3> <p>The Indiegogo pamphlet told me to paint you a desperate story on somehow if this campaign doesn't succeed, my kidneys will collapse. It's supposed to give you a sense of urgency to help contribute to the cause.</p>
<p>First of all, really? Secondary, I have two kidneys. selling one to support this idea is an easy trade-off.</p>
<p><b>We would love help, but respect any choice you make.</b> The more support and noise you bring, the easier it is for us all to move this idea to life. If you are unable to support us financially but wish to, don't get down about it!</p>
<p><i>Everyone working in this company has already committed their life to it</i>. Whether we take part-time jobs, sleep only a few hours, abandon social interactions, or sell a kidney, we have already made our decision.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Each member specializes in specific parts of the production and database.</span></li>
<li>As the founder, I handle all the creative work. I develop the website, create the media, design the Awards Process, and program the aggregation software. Sleep be damned.</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">However, no matter how hard and efficiently we work, we're very obviously an indie company, and as a result we're bound by the same limitations: 24hrs/day, food/water to fight entropy, and equipment costs to do our work.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">We've worked in the background for nearly a year in order to have something we believe to be worthwhile to show. Funds will greatly accelerate our progress, and communication will notify the world of our existence. So if you think what we're trying to do is interesting, make some noise! Tell your friends! and contribute if you believe we're worth it!</span>
</div><div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Succeed or fail, we will always find ways to thank contributors, far after this campaign ends. If the goal isn't reached, whatever funds we do raise will all go towards creating higher quality media. We recognize that GOTY's goals are ambitious, and we've all prepared for the long haul ;)</span>

<h3>What You Get</h3> <p>Everything we can possibly give. This company. This idea. It was established for the Industry, the Studios, the Community.

Our basic goal is to become the Oscars equivalent for Video Games. There, simple! Band-aid torn. No RPG marathon or ambiguous ending.
...wait! Please don't leave yet! I said simple, not easy. This wasn't a casual decision. If it were, why would the company be called GOTY? It would've been called Gamers Oppose Tart Yogurt. no offense to tart. or yogurt. and no harm meant to any organization called that. They've already been thoroughly punished.




Founder & Background

Hi, I'm Henry! Founder and CEO of GOTY LLC, a dedicated Awards Company for Interactive Entertainment. Our goal is to celebrate and award video games as Works of Art, for both the studios and their communities. Nominees and Winners are determined through Critic & Player voting, industry opinion, and numerous x-factors.
Now the guideline said to talk about myself. I suppose this is used to build empathy and show capability to you, the contributor. I'd rather just give you a whole bunch of stuff as a thank you, but the suggestion-man threatened my caffeine. Sorry guys :'(


I got into technology nearly two decades ago when I messed around with my parent's windows 91 and deleted everything


Because you know. I was a foolish toddler. 

A few years later at the budding age of 12, I programmed my first virus, software at 14, Game Design at 15, and by 16 Microsoft whispered curses at me and numerous other tinkerers as we turned the Xbox 360 into a public library. 

My parents thought I was a genius. Ha! As an immigrant, I had no friends, so I turned to the only source that could provide me with the comfort I needed: you guys. The internet.

With the support of everyone from around the world, and access to all the knowledge in the planet, I flourished. 

Degree in Chemistry to make mom & dad get off my back. And minors in engineering, physics, philosophy, and business because that was what I loved.



Deep bro, real deep. Yep, I'm getting all the feels.

The GOTY Campaign
This project, this company. It was designed with two groups in mind. The studios who craft amazing work every year, and the dedicated community who enjoys that work. I cannot emphasize enough the power of this community. You commit so much, yet are constantly burdened by inferior productions. Organizations that review games, award them, represent them; they should be the same quality as the titles themselves, and should be a reliable resource for this community to utilize.We stress quality and fairness more than anything else. Awards selections should be based on the collective opinion of the entire industry, not just a select few ""specialists"". At the same time, ceremonies should effectively honor the winning Titles and their Respective Studios.


The Awards Process


Categories

Our award divisions were designed and checked over the course of half a year to be as few and as broad as possible. Not everyone gets a cake, and only the best deserve to find out that it's a lie:


Best Art Direction -
     focuses strictly on the artistic design and aesthetic found within as well
     as inspired from the title


Best Sound Work -
     includes voice acting, narration, sound effects, songs, and orchestral
     compositions


Best Cast -
     encompasses the entire cast: protagonists, antagonists and supporting


Best Innovation -
     designed to be an ambiguous classification, this award recognizes distinctive
     creative and unique accomplishments, including elements that do not fit
     into any other category


Best Graphical Achievement - greatest engine utilization and execution
     within a title, factoring hardware limitations/advantages


Best Story -
     includes best script writing, character delivery, atmosphere, and world
     design


Best Studio -
     rated on the quality of their releases from imagining, innovations, to
     execution


Best Gameplay -
     the foundation of video games. Measuring creativity, replay value, immersion,
     flexibility and more


GOTY -
     the Game of the Year, the singular best title accomplishment. Takes every
     possible element into consideration, from the fundamentals such as
     graphics and gameplay, to x-factors such as market saturation and cultural
     influence


Selection
To ensure the most accurate selections, we researched and compiled the most accurate resource: Everything.
All qualifying Critics scores are aggregated, then error corrected. These are utilized as an initial filter so that only the most respected titles make it through.
User votes from every resource possible is collected, aggregated, error corrected (a bit more than critics). These votes are constantly utilized as a resource, from the beginning until the end of the selection process.
All relevant X-Factors are researched, from common considerations such as Public Opinion, Community, and Industry Influence, to less common considerations such as Game Culture, Market Saturation, and Profitability.
After all the data is obtained, titles each year are screened through 5 processes: 

Basic Qualification - fundamental precursors such as official release dates

1st Filter - user/critic ratings that vary each year, designed to isolate out titles that are Good

Wild Cards - user/community opinions that sway certain titles to be in a better standing

2nd Filter - user/critic ratings that vary each year, designed to isolate out titles that are Great


Exceptions - unique conditions with certain titles that allows them to qualify for specialized awards when they otherwise might not (e.g. Best Art Direction)

Finalists - the top two dozen titles are determined, in which the entire industry can vote on who they individually think deserves a nomination

Nominees - the top titles in each category move on to receive a nomination during the awards show

Winners - here votes serve as final tie breakers or confirmation for winners. It is quite common for both user and critic votes to tie. This where x-factors are incorporated, often in significant amounts in order to confirm a winner.

For complete rules & regulations  
What We Need The Indiegogo pamphlet told me to paint you a desperate story on somehow if this campaign doesn't succeed, my kidneys will collapse. It's supposed to give you a sense of urgency to help contribute to the cause.
First of all, really? Secondary, I have two kidneys. selling one to support this idea is an easy trade-off.
We would love help, but respect any choice you make. The more support and noise you bring, the easier it is for us all to move this idea to life. If you are unable to support us financially but wish to, don't get down about it!
Everyone working in this company has already committed their life to it. Whether we take part-time jobs, sleep only a few hours, abandon social interactions, or sell a kidney, we have already made our decision.

Each member specializes in specific parts of the production and database.
As the founder, I handle all the creative work. I develop the website, create the media, design the Awards Process, and program the aggregation software. Sleep be damned.
However, no matter how hard and efficiently we work, we're very obviously an indie company, and as a result we're bound by the same limitations: 24hrs/day, food/water to fight entropy, and equipment costs to do our work.

We've worked in the background for nearly a year in order to have something we believe to be worthwhile to show. Funds will greatly accelerate our progress, and communication will notify the world of our existence. So if you think what we're trying to do is interesting, make some noise! Tell your friends! and contribute if you believe we're worth it!

Succeed or fail, we will always find ways to thank contributors, far after this campaign ends. If the goal isn't reached, whatever funds we do raise will all go towards creating higher quality media. We recognize that GOTY's goals are ambitious, and we've all prepared for the long haul ;)
  

What You Get Everything we can possibly give. This company. This idea. It was established for the Industry, the Studios, the Community. You. When something we create isn't good enough, we scrap it because we're trying to create something bigger. greater. worthy of this amazing community.
PerksAccessories: we have a number of perks which award crystalline accessories. It is made with Silicon, sandblasted, with 32% Pb. Gemstone fans might recognize this composition to be the same as a rather famous crystal provider. The available designs are:

Some clarification on Blue Beam. The enemy AI is advanced and make the decision themselves, they are distributed in category 3, patrol, hunting and guard. They do not all have the same behavior you face, the average female will be frightened as some timid male but keep still less distance. While males or females will be dominant on the contrary, very angry or furious rage against you. Not to mention the army of the new order, which will be in outposts, spanking reconnaissance patrols by helicopter or ground reduced number kept an eye on the convoys and to find the fugitives. But bipedal creatures will be the last of your worry do djiins (spirits), because they are beings that you will be able to fight with weapons equipment ... I will also do my best to integrated as soon as a little craft with management of food and water, there already in some wells on the map but the heal management is not yet extensive, therefore the when she goes alone. Enemy of the game will be diverse strength and resistance, and every living species and live in their own areas, creatures are also Enemy militia, however it is not impossible to cross some who would wander like you... --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Fr:Merci à tous pour votre soutien au projet Blue Beam. quelques éclaircissement au sujet de Blue Beam. L'IA des ennemies est avancé, ils prennent les décisions de eux même, ils sont repartis dan 3 catégories, la patrouille, la chasse et la garde. Ils n'aurons pas tous les mêmes comportement face à vous, la moyenne des femelles des groupes seront effrayée de même que certains mâle craintif mais, ce tiendrons quand même moins à distance. Alors que les mâles ou femelles dominante seront au contraire, très en colère ou furieux de rage contre vous. Sans oublier l'armée du nouvel ordre, qui sera dans des avants postes, fessant des patrouilles de reconnaissance en hélico ou au sol en nombre réduite pour gardé un œil sur les convoies et pour retrouver les fugitifs. Mais les créatures bipède seront le dernier de vos souci fasse aux djiins (esprits), car ce sont des êtres que vous ne pourrai battre avec des armes matériel... Je vais également faire de mon possible pour incorporai au plus vite un peu de craft avec gestion de nourriture et d'eau, il y à déjà quelques puits sur la carte mais la gestion de la santé n'est pas encore approfondie, donc pour le moment elle remonte toute seule. Les ennemies du jeu seront de diverse force et résistance, et chaque espèces vie et habite dans sa propre zones, les créatures sont aussi les ennemie de la milice, cependant il n'est pas impossible d'en croisé certain qui ce promèneront comme vous.Thank you all!

</p><p><b>1.<span>  </span>What, when, and where is
Nerd HQ?</b></p>
<p>Nerd HQ is a <b>FREE</b>, four day event held the same weekend as San Diego
Comic Con and offers exclusive gaming and tech activations, nightly events,
and intimate celebrity panels benefiting Operation Smile. The event is scheduled to be held July 24-27, 2014 at Petco Park in San Diego, California. </p>
<p><b>2.<span>  </span>Do I get anything for my
contribution?</b></p>
<p>All
contributors will be part of the #NerdHQArmy, an exclusive email list that will
receive updates, photos, videos and much more throughout our event planning
process that can't be found anywhere else. Your name will also be placed on our
<b>""Nerd HQ Wall of Honor""</b> at the event and on our contributor page on
<a href=""http://www.thenerdmachine.com."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.thenerdmachine.com</a>. But most importantly, for your contribution, you will
receive our eternal gratitude, loyalty and our pledge to bring you the best
Nerd HQ ever!</p>
<p>Furthermore,
Nerd HQ brings you
twenty-five plus hours of ""Conversation for a Cause"" content,
live-streamed to everyone, <b>FOR FREE</b>, no matter where you are in the world
(some restrictions may apply based on country.) </p>
<p>Go to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/nerdmachinetv"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span>www.youtube.com/nerdmachinetv</span></span></a> for examples of our “Conversations.”</p>
<p><b>3.<span>  </span>What will the funds raised
by the Indiegogo campaign go towards at Nerd HQ?</b></p>
<p>Every dollar you give will go towards the production of
the event. The venue fees, staging, audio, video, production crew, event
lighting, staff, security, and activations are very expensive and every dollar
you donate will make a difference. It is up to <b>YOU </b>to help us make HQ happen. </p>
<p><b>4.<span>  </span>Does this money directly
support Operation Smile?</b></p>
<p>The contribution you are making here does not go to Operation Smile. It
enables Zac and the Nerd Machine to produce Nerd HQ and continue to raise money
for Operation Smile. Each year, we raise more money for the charity, and with
your help, we know that we can do so for years to come. </p>
<p><b>5.<span>  </span>Why should I participate if
I’m not going to attend Nerd HQ?</b></p>
<p>Great Question. Nerd HQ offers twenty-five plus hours of
""Conversation for a Cause"" content, live-streamed to
everyone, <b>FOR FREE</b>, no matter where you are in the world (some
restrictions may apply based on country.) </p>

<p><b>6.<span>  </span>Will I be able to
participate in the campaign if I live outside of the United States?</b></p>
<p>Yes! Indiegogo allows people from all over the world to contribute by
using a credit card or Paypal. If you participate, you will also receive all the
contributor benefits as a member of the Nerd HQ Army.</p>
<p><b>7.<span>  </span>If I donate to Nerd HQ can
I meet Zachary Levi in person? What if I want an autograph picture or a photo?</b></p>
<p>If you come to Nerd HQ, there is a great chance you will be able
to meet Zac. Nerd HQ offers many opportunities to interact with him, such as the “Smiles
for Smiles” and “Signings for Smiles” activations benefiting Operation Smile. </p>
<p><b>8.<span>  </span>What happens to my money if
you don’t reach your goal?</b></p>
<p>We believe with your help, the “I Want My Nerd HQ” campaign will be a success and reach the goal of $1,000,000 dollars. In the unlikely
event we do not reach our goal, Zac and the Nerd Machine will evaluate if the
event can still be produced with the money contributed, supplemented by sponsor
participation. If the event moves forward, your contributions will be used to create
the greatest Nerd HQ ever. If the funds raised are insufficient to produce Nerd
HQ, your money will be refunded minus the Indiegogo and Paypal fees. </p>
<p><b>9.<span>  </span>I don’t have any money
right now, how long do I have to contribute?</b></p>
<p>Thanks for checking out the page. The campaign will run for
45 days, until April 24, 2014. In the event that you can not give, please share
the campaign with everyone you know so that your voice is still heard. </p>
<p><b>10.  Is my donation tax
deductible?</b></p>
<p>Your donation is not tax deductible. We want to reiterate that
this is not a charitable donation, but a contribution to help produce Nerd HQ.
We are not a charity, but 100% of the panel fees, auction items, photos,
signings, and screenings at Nerd HQ benefit Operation Smile. </p>
<p><b>11.  Don't most campaigns offer perks for a contribution?</b></p><p>Usually, yes. But as Zac says in the video, Nerd HQ is the best perk we can offer. It's an amazing, free event that fans all over the world can enjoy. The ""Conversations"" are streamed live worldwide, for free. The event is open to everyone, for free. The gaming and tech activations are free. And by funding Nerd HQ you enable Zac and the Nerd Machine to continue their support of Operation Smile. Also, perks like tee shirts, posters, and special access to Nerd HQ cost time, money, and labor to fulfill. Our goal would have to be several hundred thousand dollars higher to provide these items and that would take away time and resources from planning the greatest Nerd HQ ever. </p><p><br/></p></div>","What is Nerd HQ?Here's how the campaign works.The ""I Want My Nerd HQ"" Campaign is very simple. We need your support for Nerd HQ 2014. The funding strategy we have been using to produce Nerd HQ is no longer viable due to venue deadlines and the commitments required by the Nerd Machine to properly plan the event. We wish we could continue to subsidize the event ourselves, but we simply no longer can. We believe in our hearts that YOU will help to ensure Nerd HQ can continue to offer an amazing FREE experience for fans in San Diego, fans watching online, and all the children we are able to help through the funds you contribute during Nerd HQ for Operation Smile. To date, the Nerd Machine has raised over $415,000 dollars for the charity. You have a powerful voice and the Nerd Machine needs you to use that voice and let the world know you support this campaign, whether you can contribute or not.  We love and appreciate you either way. We believe that everyone is nerdy about something, so please tweet, post, reddit, and email to get the word out and help us produce the greatest Nerd HQ ever.Please note that Nerd HQ is not affiliated with San Diego Comic Con International. Nerd HQ is planning to held at Petco Park at the same time as the convention. This part is very important. We want to make it very clear that the money you are contributing for Nerd HQ is not going to charity. The funds raised here will pay for the production of Nerd HQ in San Diego this July. 100% of the money raised by the ""Conversations,"" auction items, photos, and signings will continue to be donated to Operation Smile. In 2013, Nerd HQ raised $215,000 for the charity.Matt Smith, Zac Levi, and Richard Madden at Nerd HQ 2013Production costs include venue, staging, production crew, event lighting, video, audio, staff, security, and activations. These costs are very expensive and every dollar you donate will make a difference. It is up to YOU, to help us make HQ happen. We will continue the search for sponsors in order to make the event the most amazing HQ ever and bring you, the fans, the most dynamic ""Conversations"" and the newest in gaming and technology. Not to mention the most epic nights Nerd HQ has ever seen.Nerd HQ, the best perk we can offer.We understand that a lack of a perk structure is a rarity, if not a brand new concept, for a crowd funding campaign. However, we believe, and hope you do too, that Nerd HQ itself is the best reward we can offer. Nerd HQ brings you twenty-five plus hours of ""Conversation for a Cause"" content, live-streamed to everyone, FOR FREE, no matter where you are in the world (some restrictions may apply based on country.) The physical event in San Diego is COMPLETELY FREE for everyone to enter and enjoy. AND, we throw the most epic dance parties for both fans and celebs, again, TOTALLY FREE. In fact, the only things that cost you money at Nerd HQ, aside from all the charitable activations, is Nerd Machine merchandise and the food & beverage that you may buy while enjoying the festivities.On top of that, perks cost a great deal of money, time, and labor to produce and fulfill. If we offer perks like tee shirts, posters, or even special access at Nerd HQ, then we have to ask for even more funding from you to cover those costs. No physical perks means we can put all the money raised toward making the best Nerd HQ to date, and bringing it to you FOR...wait for it…FREE!What we CAN offer you is your NAME on the ""Nerd HQ Wall of Honor,"" that will be on display at Petco Park. This wall will be used to commemorate your victory of making HQ a reality. Each and every contributor will have their name printed on this wall. We will also place your names on the Nerd HQ contributors page at thenerdmachine.com for everyone to see. No hierarchy, nothing based on your contribution. If you give $5, your name could be next to someone who gives $500. We are all in this together.Most importantly, for your contribution, you will receive our eternal gratitude, loyalty and our pledge to bring you the best Nerd HQ ever! Fans enjoying the day at Nerd HQ 2013For those who have experienced our event, you know how amazing Nerd HQ is. For those of you that have not, we simply ask that you go to our YouTube page and watch a few ""Conversations.""

About Zac Levi and the Nerd MachineZachary Levi-Founder of the Nerd Machine and Nerd HQZachary Levi is best known for the title role on NBC’s hit show “Chuck.”  He portrayed a regular guy whose life gets scrambled
when government secrets are inadvertently downloaded into his brain while
reading an email sent from a long lost friend. ""Chuck"" has been a
media and fan favorite since its fall 2007 release and continues its worldwide popularity
even after the series finale. Zachary Levi as ChuckFans were thrilled to see Levi in the
2013 follow-up to Marvel's previous hit “Thor.”  Levi steps into the role of “Fandral the
Dashing” in fan favorite “Thor: The Dark World.” Zac as Fandral in Thor:The Dark WorldZac is also the founder of the Nerd Machine and the creator of Nerd HQ. Zac's goal was to create the most amazing fan/celebrity interaction ever at an event. He believes that YOU want a forum to speak directly to your favorite artists and be able to have an unique and intimate connection like none you have ever experienced. That goal has been reached and then surpassed. Nerd HQ is now the most popular event outside the convention center and that is all because of YOU.The Nerd Machine is spearheading a ""mission of redefinition""
that changes the global perception of what a NERD is, and thereby allowing everyone to celebrate the NERD in themselves. The question is: What are you nerdy about?Supporting Nerd HQ helps support Operation Smile.The Nerd Machine's Nerd HQ is a global experience. Not only because of the content created during the event, but the lives we are able to change around the world with the funds raised at Nerd HQ each year.Zac has been an ambassador for Operation Smile for several years and he has seen first hand what a difference they make in lives all over the world. With the help of amazing people like YOU, he and the Nerd Machine have raised over $415,000 for the charity. That is almost 1,700 lives that have been changed forever by your support of Zac, Nerd HQ, and the Nerd Machine. Again, we want to make it very clear that the money you are contributing for Nerd HQ is not going to charity. The funds raised here will pay for the production of Nerd HQ in San Diego this July. As always, One Hundred Percent (100%) of the money raised by panels, auction items, photos, and signings will continue to be donated to Operation Smile. Joss Whedon, Zachary Levi, and Nathan Fillion at Nerd HQ 2013The charity we love and support, Operation SmileGo to www.OperationSmile.org for more info about Operation SmileHelp us Obi Wan Kenobi(s), you're our only hope…(Disclaimer: Nerd HQ is not affiliated with San Diego Comic Con International. The event is scheduled to be held at the same time as SDCC at Petco Park in San Diego.)Frequently Asked Questions
1.  What, when, and where is
Nerd HQ?
Nerd HQ is a FREE, four day event held the same weekend as San Diego
Comic Con and offers exclusive gaming and tech activations, nightly events,
and intimate celebrity panels benefiting Operation Smile. The event is scheduled to be held July 24-27, 2014 at Petco Park in San Diego, California. 
2.  Do I get anything for my
contribution?
All
contributors will be part of the #NerdHQArmy, an exclusive email list that will
receive updates, photos, videos and much more throughout our event planning
process that can't be found anywhere else. Your name will also be placed on our
""Nerd HQ Wall of Honor"" at the event and on our contributor page on
www.thenerdmachine.com. But most importantly, for your contribution, you will
receive our eternal gratitude, loyalty and our pledge to bring you the best
Nerd HQ ever!
Furthermore,
Nerd HQ brings you
twenty-five plus hours of ""Conversation for a Cause"" content,
live-streamed to everyone, FOR FREE, no matter where you are in the world
(some restrictions may apply based on country.) 
Go to www.youtube.com/nerdmachinetv for examples of our “Conversations.”
3.  What will the funds raised
by the Indiegogo campaign go towards at Nerd HQ?
Every dollar you give will go towards the production of
the event. The venue fees, staging, audio, video, production crew, event
lighting, staff, security, and activations are very expensive and every dollar
you donate will make a difference. It is up to YOU to help us make HQ happen. 
4.  Does this money directly
support Operation Smile?
The contribution you are making here does not go to Operation Smile. It
enables Zac and the Nerd Machine to produce Nerd HQ and continue to raise money
for Operation Smile. Each year, we raise more money for the charity, and with
your help, we know that we can do so for years to come. 
5.  Why should I participate if
I’m not going to attend Nerd HQ?
Great Question. Nerd HQ offers twenty-five plus hours of
""Conversation for a Cause"" content, live-streamed to
everyone, FOR FREE, no matter where you are in the world (some
restrictions may apply based on country.) 
Plus,
all contributors will be part of the #NerdHQArmy, an exclusive email list that
will receive updates, photos, videos and much more throughout our event
planning process that can't be found anywhere else. Your name will also be
placed on our ""Nerd HQ Wall of Honor"" at the event and on our
contributor page on www.thenerdmachine.com But most importantly, for your
contribution, you will receive our eternal gratitude, loyalty and our pledge to
bring you the best Nerd HQ ever!
6.  Will I be able to
participate in the campaign if I live outside of the United States?
Yes! Indiegogo allows people from all over the world to contribute by
using a credit card or Paypal. If you participate, you will also receive all the
contributor benefits as a member of the Nerd HQ Army.
7.  If I donate to Nerd HQ can
I meet Zachary Levi in person? What if I want an autograph picture or a photo?
If you come to Nerd HQ, there is a great chance you will be able
to meet Zac. Nerd HQ offers many opportunities to interact with him, such as the “Smiles
for Smiles” and “Signings for Smiles” activations benefiting Operation Smile. 
8.  What happens to my money if
you don’t reach your goal?
We believe with your help, the “I Want My Nerd HQ” campaign will be a success and reach the goal of $1,000,000 dollars. In the unlikely
event we do not reach our goal, Zac and the Nerd Machine will evaluate if the
event can still be produced with the money contributed, supplemented by sponsor
participation. If the event moves forward, your contributions will be used to create
the greatest Nerd HQ ever. If the funds raised are insufficient to produce Nerd
HQ, your money will be refunded minus the Indiegogo and Paypal fees. 
9.  I don’t have any money
right now, how long do I have to contribute?
Thanks for checking out the page. The campaign will run for
45 days, until April 24, 2014. In the event that you can not give, please share
the campaign with everyone you know so that your voice is still heard. 
10.  Is my donation tax
deductible?
Your donation is not tax deductible. We want to reiterate that
this is not a charitable donation, but a contribution to help produce Nerd HQ.
We are not a charity, but 100% of the panel fees, auction items, photos,
signings, and screenings at Nerd HQ benefit Operation Smile. 
11.  Don't most campaigns offer perks for a contribution?Usually, yes. But as Zac says in the video, Nerd HQ is the best perk we can offer. It's an amazing, free event that fans all over the world can enjoy. The ""Conversations"" are streamed live worldwide, for free. The event is open to everyone, for free. The gaming and tech activations are free. And by funding Nerd HQ you enable Zac and the Nerd Machine to continue their support of Operation Smile. Also, perks like tee shirts, posters, and special access to Nerd HQ cost time, money, and labor to fulfill. Our goal would have to be several hundred thousand dollars higher to provide these items and that would take away time and resources from planning the greatest Nerd HQ ever.",18.0,3,"1 Campaign

<h2>Summary...</h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Keith Anderson, Game Developer and Creator of Numinis Online.</p>
<p>Numinis Online is a Fantasy Based FPS game, inspired by a passion for fantasy action, and the desire to feel quick accomplishments and progression.  Numinis has been in development for a little under 2 years now, and with the help of my great friend and phenomenal programmer Jonathan Hockman, we were able to accomplish a great deal of development during this time period. </p>
<p>Though Numinis was originally slated to be in beta by the end of 2012.  We were unable to keep the pace, due to real life scenarios.  Fortunately, our families support has been tremendous,  and we were able to keep the development alive by meeting up before and after work, and in between daily activities.</p>
<p>We have turned to the popular crowd-funding, because we are nearing completion of the game, and we still have some financial requirements to fulfill. We have been able to scrape up enough “out of pocket” funds to get us this far, but we aren’t there yet.  We still need to acquire specific licenses, servers and minor hardware / software components to see this project to completion. </p>
<p>Jonathan and I are “true” indie developers. We want to avoid knocking on large corporate doors, instead, we are asking people who really make all this happen.  The community! People just like you!</p>
<p>We hope that you become a supporter of Numinis Online.</p>
<h2>The Impact...</h2>
<p>We honestly didnt know that Game Development would be our ultimate destination.  Between us, we have 4 college degrees, and have probably held at least 50 different titles within the job market. From military to retail, and law enforcement to photography... we finally hit home with a passion for game development.  Its a unique story and a long road as to how we met and finally began developing, but neither of us will deny that it has been difficult.  However, we can honestly and faithfully say that it is a welcomed choice! </p>
<p>Our ultimate goal is to bring the game development industry to the local area of Kansas City. With successful funding, we will have a successful game! With a successful game, we will lead a successful company. With a successful company, we will create jobs, having successful, talented and creative teams, delivering unique games to the world!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>What we are asking for...</h2>
<p>Funding Numinis Online will be, “a dream come true” for us.  We will have the capability to properly complete this project.  We are seeking $2500 from the community.  Achievement of this goal will allow us to purchase the necessary license required to complete the project in its entirety.  In addition, we will be able to increase our server capacity and bandwidth in preparation of beta, leading us into, the “Launch”.</p>
<p><em>Your contribution will be rewarded with the following perks:</em></p>
<p><strong>Supporter:</strong>  As a supporter, you will receive guaranteed beta access (when the game becomes available for beta) and a copy of the game at release!</p>
<p><strong>Gamer</strong>:  A Gamer will receive an additional copy of the game to do with it as you please, and earn 1000 ability points to spend on your characters unlock-able abilities.  Also gain an in-game special ability earned by the achievement title ""Gamer"". Plus receive the Subsequent perk Supporter.</p>
<p><strong>Game</strong> <strong>Master</strong>:  The Game Master is included on the in game credits screen under the “Special Thanks” section. Also gain the in game achievement title “Member”, which unlocks a special ability that only a Game Master will have access to. Plus receive the Subsequent perk Supporter and Gamer.</p>
<p><strong>Adviser</strong>:  Gain alpha development access and testing with the dev's to give on the spot input and feedback before we take it to beta! You will be able to help the direction of the game and its later development.

</div></div>","Summary...
Hi, my name is Keith Anderson, Game Developer and Creator of Numinis Online.
Numinis Online is a Fantasy Based FPS game, inspired by a passion for fantasy action, and the desire to feel quick accomplishments and progression.  Numinis has been in development for a little under 2 years now, and with the help of my great friend and phenomenal programmer Jonathan Hockman, we were able to accomplish a great deal of development during this time period. 
Though Numinis was originally slated to be in beta by the end of 2012.  We were unable to keep the pace, due to real life scenarios.  Fortunately, our families support has been tremendous,  and we were able to keep the development alive by meeting up before and after work, and in between daily activities.
We have turned to the popular crowd-funding, because we are nearing completion of the game, and we still have some financial requirements to fulfill. We have been able to scrape up enough “out of pocket” funds to get us this far, but we aren’t there yet.  We still need to acquire specific licenses, servers and minor hardware / software components to see this project to completion. 
Jonathan and I are “true” indie developers. We want to avoid knocking on large corporate doors, instead, we are asking people who really make all this happen.  The community! People just like you!
We hope that you become a supporter of Numinis Online.
The Impact...
We honestly didnt know that Game Development would be our ultimate destination.  Between us, we have 4 college degrees, and have probably held at least 50 different titles within the job market. From military to retail, and law enforcement to photography... we finally hit home with a passion for game development.  Its a unique story and a long road as to how we met and finally began developing, but neither of us will deny that it has been difficult.  However, we can honestly and faithfully say that it is a welcomed choice! 
Our ultimate goal is to bring the game development industry to the local area of Kansas City. With successful funding, we will have a successful game! With a successful game, we will lead a successful company. With a successful company, we will create jobs, having successful, talented and creative teams, delivering unique games to the world!


What we are asking for...
Funding Numinis Online will be, “a dream come true” for us.  We will have the capability to properly complete this project.  We are seeking $2500 from the community.  Achievement of this goal will allow us to purchase the necessary license required to complete the project in its entirety.  In addition, we will be able to increase our server capacity and bandwidth in preparation of beta, leading us into, the “Launch”.
Your contribution will be rewarded with the following perks:
Supporter:  As a supporter, you will receive guaranteed beta access (when the game becomes available for beta) and a copy of the game at release!
Gamer:  A Gamer will receive an additional copy of the game to do with it as you please, and earn 1000 ability points to spend on your characters unlock-able abilities.  Also gain an in-game special ability earned by the achievement title ""Gamer"". Plus receive the Subsequent perk Supporter.
Game Master:  The Game Master is included on the in game credits screen under the “Special Thanks” section. Also gain the in game achievement title “Member”, which unlocks a special ability that only a Game Master will have access to. Plus receive the Subsequent perk Supporter and Gamer.
Adviser:  Gain alpha development access and testing with the dev's to give on the spot input and feedback before we take it to beta! You will be able to help the direction of the game and its later development. Additionally, you will gain the achievement ""Adviser"" which will unlock a unique special weapon and award you with 5000 ability points to spend on your characters development. Plus receive the Subsequent perk Supporter , Gamer and Game Master.
Game Master Supreme: Game Master Supremes are able to customize and host their own unique maps, and regulate who and how many players can participate.  In addition, you will have the capability to traverse standard maps and spice up game-play with randomized and timed abilities.  Become a dragon, create an earthquake, and devastate a battlefield with meteor strikes (to name a few). Plus receive the Subsequent perk Supporter , Gamer, Game Master and Adviser.

Risks and Challenges

There are risks with any crowd funded adventure, and Foxtail is no exception. Foxtail to us, is a pursuit of a dream that takes us back to the point n`clicks of yesterday, to the games that we enjoyed in all of their floppy disk, pixel art glory. We want to bring that dream to you, to entertain those who experienced these games when they were younger, and to animate a new generation of point n` click adventure lovers.

<h3>Protagonist Games</h3>
<p>Protagonist Games was founded in 2011 by David Martin in order to produce fun and engaging tabletop roleplaying games for new and old gamers alike. Shortly after ProtGames started development of its first games, David decided to bring in Matthew Dolan as the Art Director for the company's games and other product lines in order to have more time to, as David often says, ""Make da games.""</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>David has been a gamer since he was first introduced to Battletech and the STAR WARS Roleplaying Game well over 15 years ago now. In that time tabletop gaming has become his passion as a hobby, and there is no other social and leisure activity he loves more than rpgs and tabletop games. He has worked in the tabletop gaming industry as a freelance writer for about three years now, doing work for Daring Entertainment, Iron Crown Enterprises, and others. In founding Protagonist Games, David hopes to bring his own unique stamp to the tabletop gaming industry and push the current boundaries of gaming. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Matthew has been an artist is entire life and recently found the inspiration to develop his art for the gaming industry. Recognizing Matthew's rising talent in art and visionary direction, David decided to bring Matthew onto the team after the RAWR! project had begun. Since then, Matthew has already left his own personal mark on the game. Matthew is now officially part of the ProtGames production team.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Now, in late 2011, their efforts are about to pay off. <i>RAWR! The Monstrous Adventure Game</i> is almost finished, and with a planned PDF release in December 2011, David and Matthew are looking for ways to bring <i>RAWR!</i> into the print world as well. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Learn more about Protagonist Games by visiting our <a href=""http://www.protagonistgames.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">website</a>!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: 800;"">The Game</span></p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: 800;""><br/></span></p>
<p><i>RAWR!</i> is built on a simple 2D6 engine that adds the dice roll to a modifier against a target number. In other words, roll two six-sided dice, add them together, and add in your skill level. Then compare that number to a target number set by the gamemaster and you have your result. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>It's that simple to play a game of <i>RAWR!</i></p>
<p><i><br/></i></p>
<p>But the game is not just for new or younger gamers. There is a depth to the monster creation system that experienced roleplayers will enjoy as well, combining a trait system with Monstrous Abilities in order to facilitate the creation of ANY monster that could ever be imagined. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Mission: Send <i>RAWR!</i> to the printer!</h3>
<p>While much of tabletop gaming industry is moving into digital and PDF formats, there is still a strong and thriving print industry that local gaming stores rely upon. As well, gaming conventions such as GenCon, Origins, and others are a main income source for the majority of companies in the hobby industry. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Printing is not cheap, and our mission is simple. We need to raise enough money to cover the initial printing of <i>RAWR!</i> which will allow us to get it into local area gaming stores, take it to conventions, and share with the gaming community. The overall goal is to go from the ground up, growing the fan base of the game regionally and then nationally. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>For all of that, we need your help. </p>
<p><br/></p>

Now, in late 2011, their efforts are about to pay off. RAWR! The Monstrous Adventure Game is almost finished, and with a planned PDF release in December 2011, David and Matthew are looking for ways to bring RAWR! into the print world as well. 

Learn more about Protagonist Games by visiting our website!

The Game

RAWR! is built on a simple 2D6 engine that adds the dice roll to a modifier against a target number. In other words, roll two six-sided dice, add them together, and add in your skill level. Then compare that number to a target number set by the gamemaster and you have your result. 

It's that simple to play a game of RAWR!

But the game is not just for new or younger gamers. There is a depth to the monster creation system that experienced roleplayers will enjoy as well, combining a trait system with Monstrous Abilities in order to facilitate the creation of ANY monster that could ever be imagined. 



Mission: Send RAWR! to the printer!
While much of tabletop gaming industry is moving into digital and PDF formats, there is still a strong and thriving print industry that local gaming stores rely upon. As well, gaming conventions such as GenCon, Origins, and others are a main income source for the majority of companies in the hobby industry. 

Printing is not cheap, and our mission is simple. We need to raise enough money to cover the initial printing of RAWR! which will allow us to get it into local area gaming stores, take it to conventions, and share with the gaming community. The overall goal is to go from the ground up, growing the fan base of the game regionally and then nationally. 

For all of that, we need your help.

</h3>It has been a dream of mine to see the beautiful and historic Arcade, in the heart of downtown Cleveland, filled with independent shops again.  I've been given an opportunity to fill up storefront #156 from November 23 - December 23, and am reaching out to you for help in paying the rent and insurance, as well as supplies needed to help spruce up an empty storefront.  <br/><br/>As many of you may know, I have been selling my photographs at various outdoor markets and art festivals for almost two years.  It's hard work to set up a shop for a day, just to take it down several hours later, and nerve wracking to have to deal with Cleveland's weather for these outdoor markets.  But the excitement I see in people's faces when we discuss Cleveland's future at these markets is one thing that really keeps me going!  My little pop up shop might seem insignificant, but change has to start from somewhere.  And the Old Arcade is too beautiful a place to allow to sit empty any longer.  This opportunity will allow me to have a small taste of what it might be like to have a permanent space, in a building that is so important to Cleveland!<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <ul> <li>The Rent for the month is $500, insurance is $100.  I'd also need to jazz up the storefront in a temporary way as it is not in move in condition, to put it mildly!<br/>
</li> <li>If this goal is met, I plan on having an opening party after I get settled in.  So you'll have a reason to come to the Arcade and stop in the shop!</li>

<h4 style=""text-align: center;""><b>So... what is ""Super Six Card Game""
you ask?</b></h4>
<p>Super Six Card Game is
a 4 player game that uses the standard 52 card deck. Super Six Card
Game consists of 6 rounds played. The first initial 4 rounds will dictate
if you will qualify into the last 2 rounds. </p>
<p>In the beginning of
the game, you are able to bet a certain amount of credits, in which all the
players have agreed upon.</p>
<p>Example: Everyone
agrees to bet 5 credits, then that is 20 credits in the pot.</p>

<p>So here are the
detailed rules of the game. (If you don't like reading, then watching the
video below explains most of the rules.)</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">(This video has the old UI layout)</p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FDZaYtdQE3ns%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DDZaYtdQE3ns&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FDZaYtdQE3ns%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The Rules:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>1. Deal</b></p>
<p>The first person who
initiates the game becomes the dealer. The dealer deals 6 cards to each player.
This person also goes first; thereafter the winner of each round goes
first. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>2. Play</b></p>
<p>The dealer puts down
any card, playing it face up in the middle of the playing area. The other
players in turn must play a card of a higher value and of the same suit, that is, if they want to beat this card. Those who have no card of the suit played, plays
any card they choose face down. Card values are ranked highest to lowest
here <b>(A,K,Q,J,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2)</b>.</p>
<p>When all the players
have played one card, the first round is complete. Whoever played the highest
card of the suit that the first player played is the winner of the round. </p>
<p>Next, the cards played
are not gathered in but remain in a face up pile. </p>
<p>The winner of the
round then leads any card from his/her hand to begin the next round. He/she plays that card face up on top of the pile. </p>
<p>Then the same procedure happens again. Where the other
players must each play a card: this must be a higher value and of the same suit
as the card that was led, if possible, otherwise any other card.  You do this until four rounds have been played. The winner of
these first 4 rounds qualifies to be a participant in the last two rounds.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>3. Last Two Rounds</b></p>
<p>This is where it gets
really fun! It is basically the same concept as the earlier rounds but instead
of playing one card, you play two. </p>
<p>For example, the
winner of round 4 starts round 5. That person must now put the last two cards
that he/she has, on top of each other, in the order that he/she wants them to
be played. </p>
<p>This is done for all
the qualifying players. The players then show their hands and whoever wins the top card, leads the final sixth round, which is the bottom card. Exciting right?! Whoever
wins that last round wins the whole game and gets all the credits in the
pot! </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>Funds contributed will
be used for artwork to polish up the final version and web hosting. This means, in the
future, I can add a player database and in-game currency. Also I would like to create an in-game store where players are able to buy things with their credits (player customization). The funds received here will
contribute to the capability of betting in games as well. I assure you that I will do my best not to waste your money and spend the money only on where it needs to be. Also in future releases, I want to implement a single player mode with artificial intelligence so you can practice while waiting on other players to join the lobby. The funds will also go into developing that as well.</p>
<p>As of current, this
game is able to run on any browser that supports HTML5 such as the latest versions of Google Chrome, FireFox, and Internet Explorer. But that is not enough, I would like to have a dedicated ""Super Six Card Game"" app in various apps stores so the game will run smoother and have a broader audience. With that being said, the funds generated here
will help port this game to other platforms such as iOS and Android. This will
make it possible to expand the audience of Super Six Card Game.</p>
<p><b>What you get:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Every donation will be thanked publicly on our website!
     :D (unless you choose to remain anonymous)</li>
<li>Most of the perks consist of mainly receiving in-game
     credit.</li>
<li>New users will start out with 50 in-game credits, so
     get a head start and donate so you will receive more than that.</li>
<li>Credits can be used in game to bet with and also out of game, they can be used to enter into our monthly drawing for prizes. (Prizes will vary,)</li>

<p>The impact you will
have on this development is that you will make it very possible for this game
to come out the best it could have been.</p>

players have agreed upon.
Example: Everyone
agrees to bet 5 credits, then that is 20 credits in the pot.
                                                 Nice! Who doesn't like
to play dangerously right?! :P 
So here are the
detailed rules of the game. (If you don't like reading, then watching the
video below explains most of the rules.)(This video has the old UI layout) 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Rules:
1. Deal
The first person who
initiates the game becomes the dealer. The dealer deals 6 cards to each player.
This person also goes first; thereafter the winner of each round goes
first. 
2. Play
The dealer puts down
any card, playing it face up in the middle of the playing area. The other
players in turn must play a card of a higher value and of the same suit, that is, if they want to beat this card. Those who have no card of the suit played, plays
any card they choose face down. Card values are ranked highest to lowest
here (A,K,Q,J,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2).
When all the players
have played one card, the first round is complete. Whoever played the highest
card of the suit that the first player played is the winner of the round. 
Next, the cards played
are not gathered in but remain in a face up pile. 
The winner of the
round then leads any card from his/her hand to begin the next round. He/she plays that card face up on top of the pile. 
Then the same procedure happens again. Where the other
players must each play a card: this must be a higher value and of the same suit
as the card that was led, if possible, otherwise any other card.  You do this until four rounds have been played. The winner of
these first 4 rounds qualifies to be a participant in the last two rounds.
3. Last Two Rounds
This is where it gets
really fun! It is basically the same concept as the earlier rounds but instead
of playing one card, you play two. 
For example, the
winner of round 4 starts round 5. That person must now put the last two cards
that he/she has, on top of each other, in the order that he/she wants them to
be played. 
This is done for all
the qualifying players. The players then show their hands and whoever wins the top card, leads the final sixth round, which is the bottom card. Exciting right?! Whoever
wins that last round wins the whole game and gets all the credits in the
pot! 
VERY NICE!!! :D------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Project statusI've been constantly updating my progress on my website and Youtube channel. And I will continue to update the progress in the future.To sum up the project status for now: System:# 60% of the system are done. The game is already playable. Try Super Six Card Demo Now!(It need four players to start.)(If you want, open up four instances of the game in browser to test play as four players )(This video has the new UI layout)Content:# 3 of 6 stages design are done, 4rd and 5th in progress.# 50% of must-have environment objects ( art ) are done.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What We Need & What You Get
Funds contributed will
be used for artwork to polish up the final version and web hosting. This means, in the
future, I can add a player database and in-game currency. Also I would like to create an in-game store where players are able to buy things with their credits (player customization). The funds received here will
contribute to the capability of betting in games as well. I assure you that I will do my best not to waste your money and spend the money only on where it needs to be. Also in future releases, I want to implement a single player mode with artificial intelligence so you can practice while waiting on other players to join the lobby. The funds will also go into developing that as well.
As of current, this
game is able to run on any browser that supports HTML5 such as the latest versions of Google Chrome, FireFox, and Internet Explorer. But that is not enough, I would like to have a dedicated ""Super Six Card Game"" app in various apps stores so the game will run smoother and have a broader audience. With that being said, the funds generated here
will help port this game to other platforms such as iOS and Android. This will
make it possible to expand the audience of Super Six Card Game.
What you get:

Every donation will be thanked publicly on our website!
     :D (unless you choose to remain anonymous)
Most of the perks consist of mainly receiving in-game
     credit.
New users will start out with 50 in-game credits, so
     get a head start and donate so you will receive more than that.
Credits can be used in game to bet with and also out of game, they can be used to enter into our monthly drawing for prizes. (Prizes will vary,)
If you really want to start out ""Super"" fresh, then you will get to receive one of these shirt designs. Design 1:Design 2:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Impact
The impact you will
have on this development is that you will make it very possible for this game
to come out the best it could have been.
Seeing that there has
been a huge success in the ""Poker"" market had made me realize that
there is a very great possibility for a huge success in the ""Six Card""
market.
This is the vision I
see. I hope you see it too.
“An artist is not paid
for his labor but for his vision.""
- James Whistler
Yes, this will be the
first game of its kind. So invest!

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>""Fake Shemping"" is a method of creating supporting characters for tabletop roleplaying games from existing characters or even real people. The term was coined by film director Sam Raimi, and is based one of The Three Stooges, Shemp Howard. Shemp died while still under contract to Columbia Pictures. The Stooges completed four short films using existing footage, body doubles, and other trickery. Many of you are probably familiar with the Tim Burton film <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Ed Wood</span>, where Bela Lugosi died during the filming of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Plan 9 from Outer Space</span> and was replaced by Wood's wife's chiropractor. Same thing. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Shemping in roleplaying games includes recycling characters, reskinning monsters, and renaming familiar characters from movies, comics, and novels. But there's more, so much more. The book details a number of techniques for designing memorable and useful supporting characters with minimal effort, based on over 30 years of gamemastering experience. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Compleat Shemp</span> is expands upon a series of articles that originally appeared in <a href=""http://nevermetpress.com/products/open-game-table"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Open Game Table"">Open Game Table: The Anthology of Roleplaying Game Blogs, Vol. 1</a>.<br/></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The book is going to be completed one way or another. Funding just gives me incentive to prioritize this project ahead of others, rather than ""whenever I get around to it"". After release, the prices will go up, so if nothing else preordering save you money. Any excess funds will be rolled over to finance future projects. <br/></p>

<h3>HIGH QUALITY RESIN</h3>
<p>Miniatures are casted in France by ""GRX Creations"", known for the outstanding quality of his work. Working with this kind of professional is an excellent guarantee of quality.</p>
<p>We chose not to use metal for some simple reasons :</p>
<ul>
<li>Resin miniatures are incredibly much more detailed !</li>
<li>After miniatures coating, rendering and paint resistance are excellent and better, especially for the players.</li>
<li>Lighter Miniatures, which lowers shipping costs !</li>

<h3>Who are we ...?</h3>
<p>Skulls Mini was launched in Miniature World for over a year now. Our first project was <a href=""http://www.skullsmini-shop.com/categorie-produit/skulls-mini-products/the-unicorne/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>The Miniatures from The Unicorn</i></a>, licenced by Delcourt France.<br/></p>
<p>Our goals are simple :</p>
<ul>
<li>To always produce the highest possible quality miniatures.</li>
<li>To have the best contact, and an excellent customer service.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<br/>

<h3>Who follow us ?</h3>
<p>In order to obtain the highest quality miniatures, it seemed obvious that working with renowned actors was essential. However, we have not neglected the emerging talents from the miniature scene. Let me introduce them :</p>

</ul>

</ul>
<p><b>◢ Paint</b></p>
<p>A bit special, because these peoples gave their hands in the project. They painted with passion and were friendly invested in the project. It seemed very important to us to name them :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/dreamit.miniatures.7?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Martin Goumaz</a> for his unbelievable diorama, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/maxime.corbeil.3?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Maxime Corbeil</a> the Turtle, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/JuanTTC?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Nicolas Rouanet</a> aka Juan, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/yohan.leduc?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Yohan Leduc</a>, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/amon.chakai.7?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Amon Chakai</a>, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/john.keys.372?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">John Keys</a>, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=617738344&amp;fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">John Harrison</a>, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/banguetraphaelfigurines?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/jeanmarc.brisset.71?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jean-Marc Brisset</a>, and <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/laurent.bons?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Laurent Bons</a>

</ul>

<h3>And Skulls Mini, Who, When, How ?</h3>
<p>Let me introduce myself. I am ""<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Antonioooh?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Antonioooh</a>"" online, and called Antoine ROFFE (in real life!). What I have done for this project? <i>Well, not so much </i>... :)</p>
<p>I'm not very good to introduce myself. I was mostly very lucky to have the chance to work with all of these people !! Surely I am behind the project, by the countless hours devoted, but without the investment of all, this project could not have been carried out ...</p>
<p><b>        -  Special Thanks  -</b></p>
<p>A little special thanks to someone who created the first <i>Brik A Brak</i>, who followed and supported me, who translate me (as my English is not very high, especially written), and with who I shared the project from the beginning : Cécil HIS-MAHIER. This project is from him too ...             <i>""Merci à toi mon pote""</i> </p>
</div>
</div>
<div name=""WhyEuros"">
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
<a id="""" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>
<h3>WHY EUROS ?</h3>
<p>Pledges are in Euros, as we are based in Europe and everyone could simply make a credit card payment through PayPal.</p>
<p>You don't even need to own a PayPal Account !!</p>
<p>PayPal will automatically convert your currency in euros. It is as simple as reliable !</p>
</div>
<div name=""shipping"">
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>SHIPPING</h2>
<p><b><i>You must add shipping fees to your pledges ...</i></b></p>
<p>We hardly tried to create ""shipping include"" pledges and to be honest, we figured out that there will be too many issues to find a clear and fair solution for everyone; mainly looking at other previous campaigns ...</p>
<p>So, we worked to reach the lowest shipping fees as we could. You will just have to add for each pledge, corresponding shipping fees :</p>
<p><b>To France (Zone 0) : </b></p>
<ol>
<li>Gob'Da : 6 €</li>
<li>Gob'Novice : 6 €</li>
<li>Gob'Confirmed : 6 €</li>
<li>Gob'Manager : 7 €</li>
<li>Gob'Chief : 7 €</li>
</ol>
<p><b>To Europe (Zone 1) : </b></p>
<ol>
<li>Gob'Da : 7 €</li>
<li>Gob'Novice : 7 €</li>
<li>Gob'Confirmed : 7 €</li>
<li>Gob'Manager : 8 €</li>
<li>Gob'Chief : 8 €</li>
</ol>
<p><b>To International (Zone 2) : </b></p>
<ol>
<li>Gob'Da : 7 €</li>
<li>Gob'Novice : 7 €</li>
<li>Gob'Confirmed : 7 €</li>
<li>Gob'Manager : 9 €</li>
<li>Gob'Chief : 9 €</li>
</ol>
<p><span style=""color: #CC0000;"">If you take at least two pledges, only apply once the Gob'Chief fees ...</span><br/>It seems really simply to us, but if you have a doubt, fell free to ask !<br/></p>

<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
<h2>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</h2>
<p>This miniature range is our first project of this magnitude.</p>

GOB'Z'HEROES CREW









































NEW : The following miniatures are ADD-ONs. 
Not available in any Pledges, all informations bellow...





To GET ADD-ON : all informations bellow...





SCALE


We makes choice that they are big goblins heroes, this will be better for painters. We wanted to keep a lot of details... :) 

               Scale in centimeters
HIGH QUALITY RESIN
Miniatures are casted in France by ""GRX Creations"", known for the outstanding quality of his work. Working with this kind of professional is an excellent guarantee of quality.
We chose not to use metal for some simple reasons :

Resin miniatures are incredibly much more detailed !
After miniatures coating, rendering and paint resistance are excellent and better, especially for the players.
Lighter Miniatures, which lowers shipping costs !

DA CLASH CROSSOVER

Skulls Mini join Ammon Miniatures and their Da Clash Game with two Strech'Gobz : Tazzer'Gob et Gob'Rabbit !!
After their release, these miniatures will be playable in Da Clash. They will meet Gobleon and his friends in this awesome cocktail game !
Da Clash Game is available right now at Skulls Mini WebShop





Who are we ...?
Skulls Mini was launched in Miniature World for over a year now. Our first project was The Miniatures from The Unicorn, licenced by Delcourt France.
Our goals are simple :

To always produce the highest possible quality miniatures.
To have the best contact, and an excellent customer service.




Who follow us ?
In order to obtain the highest quality miniatures, it seemed obvious that working with renowned actors was essential. However, we have not neglected the emerging talents from the miniature scene. Let me introduce them :
◢ Sculpture


MIKH : Gob'Da and Sergeant'Gob


Valentin ZAK : Wonder'Gob and Torch'Gob


Patrick MASSON : Gob'Ninja


Benoit CAUCHIE : Grumpy'Gob


Christian HARDY : Aqua'Gob abd Hammer'Gob


Tom HUGUES : Tazzer'Gob, Super'Gob and Tree'Troll

Highlight to Stéphane CAMOSSETTO, who sculpted most of Gob'z'heroes: Big'Eye, Dragon'Gob, Gob'tective, Big'Red, Snot'Gob, Gob'Rabbit, and Troll'Thing. He will be chief sculptor in charge of BriK A BraK Episode 2, in cooperation with Mohammad Hossein Attaran.

◢ Design


Stephano Moroni : He is the pencil of original concepts. Decisive in this project development, he was the first I worked with, around a simple idea ...

Jean-Michel BRISSET : He realized every colorizations of Stephano's original concepts.

DarkElixir : StreetGraphist at his firsts, a really talented artist who allow me to apprehend different views about Gob'z.

Adrian Prado : He currently work for Bigchild Creative, Adrian make us an Episode 2 preview, in a beautiful scene.

◢ Paint
A bit special, because these peoples gave their hands in the project. They painted with passion and were friendly invested in the project. It seemed very important to us to name them :


Martin Goumaz for his unbelievable diorama, Maxime Corbeil the Turtle, Nicolas Rouanet aka Juan, Yohan Leduc, Amon Chakai, John Keys, John Harrison, Jean-Marc Brisset, and Laurent Bons

We confess we had the chance to work with Sergio Calvo, who painted GOB'DA. I offer my thanks to him, has he has not a lot of free time :-)




And Skulls Mini, Who, When, How ?
Let me introduce myself. I am ""Antonioooh"" online, and called Antoine ROFFE (in real life!). What I have done for this project? Well, not so much ... :)
I'm not very good to introduce myself. I was mostly very lucky to have the chance to work with all of these people !! Surely I am behind the project, by the countless hours devoted, but without the investment of all, this project could not have been carried out ...
        -  Special Thanks  -
A little special thanks to someone who created the first Brik A Brak, who followed and supported me, who translate me (as my English is not very high, especially written), and with who I shared the project from the beginning : Cécil HIS-MAHIER. This project is from him too ...             ""Merci à toi mon pote"" 





WHY EUROS ?
Pledges are in Euros, as we are based in Europe and everyone could simply make a credit card payment through PayPal.
You don't even need to own a PayPal Account !!
PayPal will automatically convert your currency in euros. It is as simple as reliable !



SHIPPING
You must add shipping fees to your pledges ...
We hardly tried to create ""shipping include"" pledges and to be honest, we figured out that there will be too many issues to find a clear and fair solution for everyone; mainly looking at other previous campaigns ...
So, we worked to reach the lowest shipping fees as we could. You will just have to add for each pledge, corresponding shipping fees :
To France (Zone 0) : 

Gob'Da : 6 €
Gob'Novice : 6 €
Gob'Confirmed : 6 €
Gob'Manager : 7 €
Gob'Chief : 7 €

To Europe (Zone 1) : 

Gob'Da : 7 €
Gob'Novice : 7 €
Gob'Confirmed : 7 €
Gob'Manager : 8 €
Gob'Chief : 8 €

To International (Zone 2) : 

Gob'Da : 7 €
Gob'Novice : 7 €
Gob'Confirmed : 7 €
Gob'Manager : 9 €
Gob'Chief : 9 €

If you take at least two pledges, only apply once the Gob'Chief fees ...It seems really simply to us, but if you have a doubt, fell free to ask !



RISKS AND CHALLENGES
This miniature range is our first project of this magnitude.
Our goal was to produce wonderful miniatures. We had to !
          ... and I hope we succeed !
We took big risks to get to this point, by our investment, both personal and financial. Many people have not heard of us yet. The challenge is just more exciting : provide a great product and convince you to remain into the project. Why that ?
Brik A Brak, it is 3 episodes :


Gob'z'heros
Gob'robots
Gob'vilains

If this episode is a success, the second one will launched as soon as possible (April or May), the third one will follow, and a game is scheduled for the end of the year. A real BRAWL GOB GAME !  ^^

     WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT TO MAKE 2015 ...

<p>Preventing and responding to adolescent <span class=""il"">dating</span> <span class=""il"">violence</span> can break the cycle of <span class=""il"">violence</span> in romantic relationships that starts early in life.

Students with smart phones can pre-program six of their closest friends' phone numbers into the app, and with two taps, ask for an interruption, to be picked up from an uncomfortable or dangerous situation, or just let each other know that they're supported. The app provides an easy way to ask for help without victims feeling the need to explain themselves.<br/><br/>The foundations of the  DVApp lie in the Social-Ecological Model (a framework for <span class=""il"">violence</span> prevention). DVApp intends to prevent sexual assault and <span class=""il"">teen</span> <span class=""il"">dating</span> <span class=""il"">violence</span> by promoting a self-driven understanding of factors that influence <span class=""il"">teen</span> <span class=""il"">dating</span> <span class=""il"">violence</span>and the safety measures to be taken. DVApp is a prevention tool based on a thorough use of avenues like relationships, communities, and societal factors.</p>
<p>DVApp is being developed based on the multiple levels of influence on today's young people and how each of these levels of influence could be used to prevent <span class=""il"">teen</span> <span class=""il"">dating</span> <span class=""il"">violence</span>. This approach is multifactorial, explores the interplay between several factors affecting <span class=""il"">teens</span> and their safety, and is more likely to generate a comprehensive sexual <span class=""il"">violence</span> and <span class=""il"">teen</span> <span class=""il"">dating</span> <span class=""il"">violence</span> prevention and response effort.?</p>
<p>INDIVIDUAL<br/>DVApp starts with the individual. Because of individual differences - age, gender, race, socioeconomic standing, etc.- every individual will use DVApp differently.

Lay siege to your friend’s cities as you cripple their empire! Protect your lands as your enemies close in around you! You rewrite the chronicles of history as you compete with up to three other friends to construct history’s most glorious NATION!


Nation is a worker based civilization card game where 2 to 4 players (up to 6 with further expansions) can play, vying to have the most victory points at the end of the game. Place worker tokens on map cards to play cards from your hand that give unique and sometimes game changing abilities and resources. Build up towns which give you victory points and battle your opponents to overthrow their towns or remove civilian cards they have placed in their nation. Explore new map areas to annex tribes or obtain more civilians.


Here is a video explaining who we are, what we hope to accomplish and at the end of the video there is a few minute example of game play. It will give you an idea of how easy of a game it is to play while still a depth of strategy that will keep you playing again and again.

Click here for a complete pdf of the rules.Nation consists of five map types: Water, Mountain, Plains, Forest and Desert each having their own inhabitants. These inhabitants are the civilians that build up your nation. Each Civilian has a unique ability that takes effect when you play that civilian into your nation. The Civilian also provides you with materials to build towns, food to play more workers, or military power to defend your towns and nation or battle your opponents. 4 Artists are contributing their talents to the look and feel of this game. 
In the game for each worker that you can play based upon the food you have, you can take 1 of 4 actions. Develop, Draw, Build or Battle. 
     The Develop action allows you to play a civilian card into your nation taking its unique action. The civilians in your Nation also work towards gaining victory points at the end of the game. 
     The Draw action lets you discard and draw cards from the civilian deck.
     The Build action caused you to build a populous on a map card. The populous are important to obtaining victory points at the end of the game. 
     The Battle action allows you to take over other players populous' as well as gives you the opportunity to remove civilians from their Nations. Giving you the advantage when it comes to count vitory points at the end of the game.
 
We (Jason and Dyson) are two avid boardgamers that have a great idea for a game. We want to raise the money for the initial printing of the game. With a goal of supplying all of the copies that you, the wonderful backer, deserves. As well as extras to market the game further. Our end goal is to be able to sell our game nationwide, and we want your help. After we get this game complete we have other great ideas that we want to be able to finish and produce. Currently our artists are feverishly working on getting the artwork complete, once that happens and our backing goal is met, we will be sending the game to the printers where the cards and components will be sent back to us. Then we will be boxing up the game and mailing it to you within 2 months of the art and backing complete.  


Along
 with the base game, there will be six expansions and a final backer 
expansion each adding their own aspect to the game without increasing 
the overall length of game. Expansions will come in packs of two. 
Expansions are interchangeable, in that, you may play one, some or all 
of the expansions if you so choose.Expansion #1: Magic vs. TechnologyThe
 Events Expansion can be a great bane or boon to all nations. From 
floods, volcanoes to bumper crops the effects of the events will leave 
their lasting impression on the nations.

The Magic Expansion opens the realm of the arcana into the game nation 
allowing spells to be flung back and forth slowing your opponents’ 
growth or expediting yours.The Technology Expansion adds 
technological advancements to your nation, from gunpowder to the 
printing press their benefits will allow your nation to flourish.Expansion #2: Political IntrigueThe Political Expansion brings the chance for you to vote on a political system that gives your continuous benefits throughout the game.The Intrigue Expansion can drastically change the outcome of a battle and adds randomness into every battle that have interesting effects.

Expansion #3: The Race for SpaceThe Race for Space Expansion brings the element of space exploration to your nation. Will you grow your nation on other planets or meet alien races willing to help you build the greatness of your nation? This expansion also allows for 2 more friends to join in for a total of 6 playing the game.Expansion #4: Custom CatdsAn
 expansion of 12 cards to add to your nation game designed by some of 
the special backers who contribute over 120$ to the game.

world of APOCalypse 2500</span></h2>
<p><span>The
game is set in the 26th century (hence the reference to the year 2500 in the
name) in a world markedly changed from the one we know in the 21st century. The
basic premise of the game is that science in its zeal to create instantaneous
pan-oceanic travel opened an uncontrollable wormhole. This new phenomenon
became self sustaining in the Arizona desert where it connects earth to
alternate realities in time and space.</span></p>

civilization collapse. The time of the game setting is 400 years after the
vortex's formation. The world of Apocalypse 2500 is populated by humans,
mutants, and aliens, and nearly all the ancient legendary races like elves,
dwarfs, and trolls. In this new world of the 26th century, or 4th century AV in
game time, it is entirely possible to encounter creatures using a mix of magic
and technology. This leads to some interesting scenarios where you have Orc
armies with horse drawn carts mounting .30 cal machine guns led by a
techno-sorcerer warlord.</span></p>
<p><span>In
writing this game I have gone to great lengths to explain the technology,
magic, and create new twists on the familiar creatures and monsters of legend.
The reason that magic exists in this post apocalyptic future and the reasons it
permeates ancient human legend is well explained in a very unique and believable
way.</span></p>
<p><span>This
mix and match of technology and magic is also available to player characters as
well, who are not bound to the rigid ""class"" systems allowing cross
vocational skill acquisition leading to an endless number of custom character types.
A large number of player character species are available as usage of many
creatures from the bestiary is possible. </span></p>

maintain such efforts until the game itself reaches a large enough audience

what money is raised will still be spent to promote the game and develop a better internet presence.  </p><h4>

Our first project, <i>Scissors</i>, will be a horror scarejump type game, with simple gameplay and clear objectives, as well as the purpose to scare you shitless. Our first purpose, except creating entertainment for people like us, was to discover what this sort of career would require and wether we'd like it or not. Your donation would help us greatly in improving <i>Scissors</i>' menus, graphics, story, gameplay, and spreading; and maybe saving up a little for future projects. <div>
<i><br/></i><div><big><i><b>What we need&amp;what you get </b></i></big></div>
<div>For this project, we need to raise a total of 3,000 € (euros). These will be used for funding game gadgets, purchase professional software, and drink a lot of energy drinks to keep us awake and at work at night!

</div></div>","About Us  We are Redlight Entertainment, a small game developing team from Italy, formed by five seventeen-to-twenty highschool and university students. Our first project, Scissors, will be a horror scarejump type game, with simple gameplay and clear objectives, as well as the purpose to scare you shitless. Our first purpose, except creating entertainment for people like us, was to discover what this sort of career would require and wether we'd like it or not. Your donation would help us greatly in improving Scissors' menus, graphics, story, gameplay, and spreading; and maybe saving up a little for future projects. 
What we need&what you get 
For this project, we need to raise a total of 3,000 € (euros). These will be used for funding game gadgets, purchase professional software, and drink a lot of energy drinks to keep us awake and at work at night! The software we need include the professional Japanese digital painting program Paint Tool SAI and an Adobe CS5 suite (containing programs such as Flash, Photoshop, AfterEffects, Illustrator and Dream Weaver) –  in case we get more than what we need, we'll also purchase Autodesk's 3D modeling program 3DS Max and a sound editing software like Cubase or Ableton. In case we don't make it to our goal – well, we'll still try to purchase as much as we can, with a priority for the badges.  For any amount you will donate, you will receive something!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Minecon Server Edition is one of, if not the, largest virtual Minecraft convention around. The whole premise of us is that if you cannot make proper Minecon, then, no matter where you are, you can get online and login to ours. Best of all, the tickets are free!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The demand for, well, pretty much everything this year has been overwhelming; you guys are amazing! However, we want to make this event the best in every single (and double) way. Having the Management Team all in England, as well as most of the Lead Staff means that all our Internets are slower than a dead creeper. As such, we really need to find a place where multiple streams in 1080p are possible, as well as creating an environment for the Lead Staff that means instant communication as well as un-interrupted work. Offices, ladies and gentlemen, offices!</p>
<p>We are looking at an office<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> that can hold 6 of our team/livestreamers for a week during the event. However, obviously this isn't cheap. Then coupled with lodgings as well, everything very much so stacks up! </span></p>
<p>But we don't want to be a boring piece of dirt. Instead, we offer you diamond like awards for pledging for this cause, as you can see below:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p></p>
<p>If we have offices, the streams will greatly increase in quality. The main one will be in 1080p, and we will also have a second one that currently exists in the form of a popular Spreaker.com radio broadcast. Two 1080p streams, peeps! </p>
<p>Of course there is also the perfect environment created as well; we're all together, and can shout at each other instead of messaging in Skype. Much better! This means less derps by the team. We all know how difficult it is to keep tabs on Skype when you're livestreaming to thousands of people, right? This'll fix it!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p></p>
<p>If you don't want to, or cannot pledge us money, but still support the cause, then please spread the word! Tweet this page, Facebook it, or whatever the kids do these days. Tell your friends! Your parents! Your children! Your uncles and aunties! </p>
<p>But most of all, spread the word to your dog. Woof.</p>

A talented, award-winning Creative, he’s responsible for the vision, concept, design and format of 13 UNBRACKETED. His attention to detail and focus on a user-friendly experience help deliver the goods in a simple yet fun way. http://venosdeladvertising.comCollaborating from the beginning with Gale, James is our UX and digital design expert. His deep understanding of web architecture is critical to the game’s success and he helps guide the project through the user’s perspective. http://rogueantdesign.comErik handles the programming as well as all of the fancy back end technology that brings 13 UNBRACKETED to life. He is a can-do problem solver with deep database experience. He also brings a designer’s attention to detail to the front end. http://www.upperhouse.usIn addition to the core creative team there’s Scott and Lea Ann. True believers and early investors in the game. They're Pioneer Elite #1 in our books. Also, we'd like to thank Lynn for helping behind the scenes and for her support. James, Erik, Gale, Scott & Lea Ann13 UNBRACKETED is an opportunity for our team to expand our horizons and grow creatively. We have carefully crafted what we feel is a great experience for the user. TIMING.We have planned the timing of the Indiegogo campaign to coincide with important dates of the tournament. The Indiegogo campaign will end at midnight on Tuesday, March 18th. Selection Sunday is March 16th and the first email invitations to the league creators and the public league players will go out that evening. Additional invitations will be sent as people continue to back the project.The tournament (minus the ""play-in"" games) begins on Thursday the 20th.

Liberty Ministries is an English ministry in a predominantly French province. There are over 8 million people in Quebec of which 1 million are English speaking. According to statistics, Quebec’s population is the second largest in Canada. This alone makes it a province that is in need of the Light of the Gospel. There are only .05% of Quebec’s population that are Christian, less than Japan’s 1%. Quebec is a mission field that is ripe for the Light of Jesus Christ to penetrate the darkness that surrounds it. If we were to take Quebec’s English speaking population alone it would still be Canada’s 6<sup>th</sup> largest province. English speaking people of Quebec are neglected because the focus is on the French speaking people – the larger population of Quebec.</p>

<p>There is a large percentage of Quebec that follows the Catholic faith. Some of these followers have been frustrated and/or disheartened because of the child abuses perpetuated by Priests that have come to the forefront of the news lately.

However our Sunday school program has been exploding and we are barely able to seat the new people that are coming to Sunday services. We have a building that we believe the Lord has selected for us and we also believe this building will be completely paid for the day we move into it. We are looking to raise $400,000 in order to purchase this building. $50,000 is our first phase of this project. The price is not very high considering it is a church.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>LiveAce is a subscription-based online poker site that allows players to play in ring games (limit hold’em, no limit hold’em, pot limit omaha) and convert their chips into real money and valuable prizes.  We are planning a live launch in June 2013.  <em><strong>Please check if you reside in an eligible state (in ""Eligible States"" below) before contributing.</strong></em></p>
<h3>The Team</h3>
<p>LiveAce was founded by a dedicated group of poker entrepreneurs to fill the void left in the online poker market after Black Friday when the U.S. government shut down the three largest offshore poker sites that catered to U.S. players. We’ve created a U.S.-based, legal poker site and have used our background in casino and online poker to comprehensively design a poker gameplay experience which caters to both serious and recreational players. We think you’ll agree that LiveAce brings back all the excitement of traditional online cash games - where you can play on your schedule and win real money – all while improving your skills.</p>
<h3>Why We're Different</h3>
<p>Today online poker players have a choice between tournament sites and “social” poker sites.  Because no money can be won, “social” poker sites are plagued by poor play as players assign no value to their chips and therefore don’t take the game seriously. While tournament sites allow the player to win cash or prizes, tournaments are a big time commitment and only a lucky few are able win anything of value.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Solution</h3>
<p>Because the chips you win on LiveAce can be used to win real cash and prizes, the quality of the gameplay more closely resembles a real money game.  Plus, we focus exclusively on ring games which allows you to play on your schedule.  Best of all we auction off real cash every day - paid right to your Paypal account or mailed via check without hassle or delay.</p>
<p>If you want to play competitive ring games as well as have the ability to win real money, LiveAce is your home. </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Funding a startup is expensive and time consuming.  In addition to working tirelessly on the business, the founders and investors have invested significant money to develop the site through our recent beta testing phase.</p>
<p>The funding for this project will be used to pay salaries for our U.S.-based software development team.</p>
<p>We’ll be offering two types of memberships: Basic and Club Live. </p>

<h3>Basic Membership</h3>
<p>A basic membership does not require you to spend anything to enjoy the games or win money.  You receive a modest amount of chips upon signup and also have the ability to “top up” reload once per day if you run low on chips.  Additional chip packages are available for purchase from $2.49 to $39.99.</p>
<h3>Club Live Premium Membership</h3>
Club Live is the best way to enjoy LiveAce.  In addition to a large signup and monthly chip award, you get access to Handmaker (which shows you real time odds of making strong hands) and a higher daily “top up” reload.  You may also choose from over two dozen custom avatars and enjoy advertising-free poker.  As a Club Live member you may also purchase chip packages a la carte.  Club Live is only $24.99 per month.</div>

We are here to show that these horses can be rehabilitated and turned into some of the best hunter/jumpers or even barrel racers! 

 
Choose from 5 different breeds currently (we will be expanding our breeds as we do more research into racing breeds).

Purchase a retired race horse from the track.
Complete the rehab time before you being training a new discipline.
 Use training tickets to help give your horse an extra boost. 
 Choose from 8 disciplines to train and compete your horse in.
Build your barn up to be the top barn in whatever category you choose. 
Achievable goals.
Genetics
Dynamic images to match your horses genetics.

Plus many more features to come!
 
   
 The main thing we currently need is extra funding. We can only provide so much out of pocket at the current moment which is hindering the progress. The contributions we receive will go towards paying for programming and site artwork. With your help we will be able to open the site even sooner! 
Main things funds will be used for:

<p><b>Update, May 31:</b></p>
<p>We've received excellent attention on social media, and you guys have shared this campaign like there's no tomorrow. Thank you! Unfortunately our goal has been badly formulated, and people coming to the site haven't become funders, even though they've loved the concept.</p>
<p>So we're revamping the campaign a little bit: The initial goal is much lower with the aim of creating a fancy supplement for <i>Age of the Tempest</i>. (Later on, we still have the stretch goal of making more translations, but that's too early for now.)</p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i>Age of the Tempest</i> is a tabletop roleplaying game for kids and beginners. We crowdfunded it in Finland two years ago, published last year in Finnish, and distributed it to gaming stores, book stores and even supermarkets. Now we want to do the same in English, and later in other languages.</p>

(You can use this campaign to pre-order your own copy with the <b>Boxed Set </b>and <b>Full Set</b> perks.)<p> </p>If we reach our goal, we'll also publsh a high quality supplement adventure for the game by designer Ville Vuorela, art by Marko Laine. If we reach our 6000€ stretch goal, we'll release a small monster manual.<br/><br/>The main motivation for this campaign is to introduce roleplaying to the new generation. Thanks for your help!<h3> </h3>

<h3>Who is this guy?</h3>My name is Mike Pohjola, I'm a game designer and writer from Finland. I've written novels, screenplays, transmedia productions, mobile games, stage musicals, comics, and have been recognized for them in the real world with an Emmy nomination, a Prix Europa, and that kind of stuff. But my real passion lies with role-playing games.<p> </p>
<h3> </h3>
<p>I started playing role-playing games in 1988 when my scout master introduced us to the Dungeons &amp; Dragons ""Red Box"" set. Since then I've played and run countless table-top role-playing games and larps, and designed four table-top role-playing games myself.</p>
<p>I'm one of a generation that started playing with the many beginner-friendly games of the late 80s and early 90s. Since then there's always been role-playing games available for us, of increasing complexity, and always speaking to us at a level suitable for our age and interests. So right now there are really many excellent role-playing games for 30-40 year-old experienced gamers.</p>
<p>But there are no role-playing games for a kid of eight or ten or twelve who's kind of interested, but doesn't know where to start. We fixed this problem in Finland last year, and now you and I will to fix this problem around the world!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Roleplaying for kids</h3>
<p>Age of the Tempest is an entry-level tabletop roleplaying game for kids. Nothing like this has been available for a generation, so it's up to us to remedy the situation.</p>
<p>The story is a fantasy adventure about a group of brave rebels who live in a secret camp in the forest and fight against an evil witch emperor, in the vein of Robin Hood, Star Wars and Knights of the Round Table. And yes, it has lots of strong female characters!</p>
<p>A good introductory roleplaying game and a good kids' roleplaying game are not necessarily the same, but this one is both.</p>
<p>The whole thing begins with a short solo adventure that is an introduction to roleplaying, to the world and the story, and to the basic rules mechanics. (If you remember the Dungeons &amp; Dragons Red Box with Aleena the Cleric and Bargle the Magic-User, then this serves the same purpose.)</p>
<p>After that we take our time explaining all the concepts you need to know when creating a character (from seven exciting archetypes), and so on.</p>
<p>Character creation is fairly streamlined with giving you a few choices (""choose one of two skills/weapons"", ""choose your weakness""), but not forcing you to go through skill lists or anything like that. There's plenty of time for more complex stuff later.</p>
<p>The Game Master's Guide is also targeted for beginners, meaning that if you just got the game as a birthday present this morning, you can run it for your friends at the party in the afternoon. While you're doing that, you learn the tricks of the trade, and eventually will get to do a bit of designing, too.</p>
<p>Most of the GM Guide is a pre-made campaign which continues directly from where the solo adventure left you. It has twists and turns, memorable characters and -- of course -- interesting opponents, puzzles and decisions. I'm a professional writer with experience in writing for children and young adults, so while the story is cool and exciting, it doesn't have any elements that you couldn't have in a Star Wars film or a Harry Potter book.</p>
<p>There are Age of the Tempest clubs and groups springing up all over, some of them with an experienced or adult GM, others where the kids play by themselves. Judging from the feedback, both have worked really well.</p>
<p>I've played the game with my 60+ parents, and my son who's almost four, and all of them have enjoyed it. It would help if he could read, but we're doing ok. (There's one monster that I won't show him until his six, though.)</p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We're not asking your money to make the game. We already have the game! We crowdfunded it two years ago in Finland, and published it last year in Finnish. We have the game design, the story, the art, the lay-out, all the content is there. It's available in Finnish gaming stores, book stores, toy stores, libraries, and even supermarkets, and people are starting role-playing clubs all over the country.</p>
<p>We already have an English translation, and demoed it at the Essen game fair last October.</p>
<p>Next, and this is where you come in, we want to properly publish and distribute the English version in English speaking countries and for those who want it in other countries. And create supplements for it: adventures, new character classes and skills, monster manuals and such.</p>
<p>Our initial goal is an original Age of the Tempest adventure designed by Finnish game design guru Ville Vuorela (of Stalker and Praedor fame).</p>
<p>If we reach 6000€, we'll release a second supplement: A monster manual. And I hope to make it the best monster manual in the world with not just statistics, but also great pictures, stories, and references to real world science, mythology and psychology from which these creatures come from.</p>
<p>If we reach our 50000€ stretch goal, we'll be able to afford a new translation, and have <i>Age of the Tempest</i> available in a third language. We'll contact you then, and have a vote on which language it should be!</p>
<p>So thanks to the people of Finland, we already have the game. Now we need your help to make it available for you! (The game is in no way specific to Finland, international distribution was our secret master plan all along!)</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/599251/files/20140523061312-photo37.jpg?1400850792"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>So what do you get out of it? For me one key motivation was to make sure my own son will have a chance to play role-playing games when he's a few years older. (Actually, I couldn't resist, we're already playing Age of the Tempest. He's almost four years old, and he plays the big brutish warrior guy Stallo.)</p>
<p>The main product of the campaign is, of course, a beautiful boxed set of Age of the Tempest - Sword of the High King. Plus we have tee shirts, wallpapers, and other fancy stuff.</p>
<p>Then, if we get enough funds, we'll be able to make supplements, sequels, adventures, monster manuals, new skills and character classes, prose anthologies, comic books, and apps to help you get further into the world of Age of the Tempest.</p>
<p>If you're feeling really generous, we have some high-end stuff available, as well, such as signed art prints, deluxe edition books, exclusive gaming sessions and more!</p>
<h3>The story so far...</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<p>This whole thing started two years ago with a crowdfunding campaign that I launched in northern Europe's biggest RPG convention Ropecon in Finland. The goal was $12 500 and we made $16 029. Yay!</p>
<h3> </h3>
<p>The project back then was to self-publish a prototype thousand-copy print-run of the game in Finnish re-using existing art I'd get from friendly artists. And to use that prototype to convince publishers, distributors, and retailers that they need to make a proper version of this game available for the kids of today.</p>
<p>Things escalated quickly. I got offers of help from artists, proof-readers and many other people, and suddenly we had a plan for getting proper new art for the game. Then we got lots of publicity for the project. Then we made our funding goal in about half of the time we'd reserved for it. It started to look like this would be a pretty well-made prototype.</p>
<p>And then the success of the crowdfunding campaign right here on IndieGoGo convinced Europe's fourth biggest board game publisher Tactic (based in Finland) that there was something to this thing. Boom! Now we had a publisher and a distributor, and a print-run of many thousands. And then together with them, we were able to use the successful crowdfunding campaign to convince retailers that they really have this game on their shelves.</p>
<p>And thus for the first time in twenty years bookstores, toy stores and supermarkets are selling a role-playing game. In a box! And people are buying it. And best of all, kids are playing it! Kids who'd never role-played before. (Also many other beginners, including my parents, who are both over 60.)</p>
<p>The Finnish-language boxed set was published in Ropecon in July 2013. We've shipped the copies to crowdfunders, and are planning sequels and supplements now. </p>
<p>At the Essen game fair in Germany in Octoboer 2013 we already had an English language prototype under the working title ""Heroes of the Storm"". Now we've settled on <i>Age of the Tempest - Sword of the High King</i>!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/599266/files/20140523062221-Staalo_crop.jpg?1400851341"" src="""" style=""width: 581.758px;height: 788px;""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How your money is used</h3>
<p>How will the money from the crowdfunding campaign be used? The exact percentages are dependant on the money we make and the perks selected, but if we make exactly 5000€ and everybody selects the ""Boxed set"" perk for 60€, the money will be divided like this.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/615934/files/20140531024535-Screen_shot_2014-05-31_at_1.01.38_PM.png?1401529535"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Which means if we get 5000€, we'll have enough to make the new adventure supplement. If we get 6000€, we'll make a little monster manual. But if we get more, we'll have new stuff we can make. And (as per our earlier goal), if we make 50000€, we can afford a new translation to bring <i>Age of the Tempest</i> into a third language.</p>
<p>As we go bigger, some percentages go up, others go down. But this is the rough outline. We will keep updating the budget to reflect the current status of the campaign.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/599269/files/20140523062304-Niekka4_crop.jpg?1400851384"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p> <p> </p>
<h3>Postage</h3>If you've paid for something physical (such as the game box), and you don't want to pick it up from wherever we happen to be, you will probably have to pay for the postage and packing. (Unless your perk says otherwise.)<p> </p>
<p>Finland: 13€<br/>Europe: 24€<br/>Globally: 33€</p>
<p>The only exception to this is, if you just want the Player's Guide without the box. In that case we can send it as a regular letter, and it's only 5€ no matter where you live!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks</h3>No crowdfunding campaign is entirely without risks, but the ones here aren't too big.<p> </p>
<p>The worst case scenario is that we don't reach 5000 €, and can't afford a new supplement. But we will still have the game available in English and Finnish, and you get your perks in one of those languages.</p>
<p>After that, we can use the publicity, the good-will, the community, and the interest to generate translations and distribution deals through traditional channels.</p>
<p>But let's make sure it doesn't come to that, but instead we will get lots of supplements and translations, and have <i>Age of the Tempest</i> available in your local supermarket, too!</p>

(We will also discontinue the InDemand option where you can order stuff directly from IndieGoGO. This way we can focus more on making games and less on carrying them to the post office.)Update April 15, 2016:All the backers who have paid for postage and told us their address have now received the boxed set and other physical perks. You can also purchase it in Finnish gaming stores (Fantasiapelit or Puolenkuun pelit) or in Sweden at SF Bokhandeln. All three also ship the game anywhere around the world.The look for more retailers and distributors has begun...Update March 8, 2016:The boxed set is now published! We will start sending copies to backers...Update December 22, 2015:Dear backers, thanks for your patience!* I hope to go through proofreader comments before the New Year, and finally send the game to my designer to get the lay-out done. That way we could print the game early next year.* We have ordered some new illustrations for the translation, based on feedback we've received from the Finnish players. Three out of four are finished, you can see one of them at the end of this message.* The translator is starting work on the adventure supplement over the holidays. We hope to have that, too, out early next year.Over all, things are slowly moving forwards, and we are set to get Age of the Tempest to you next year!Have a great winter holiday! Here's a little sneak preview of the cottage of the good witch Inya. The concept is inspired by Baba Yaga's house in Russian fairytales. The art is by Marko Laine.Update, April 30, 2015: While still finalizing the proof reading and beginning work on lay-out, we've opened the campaign in ""InDemand."" It means you can use this site to pre-purchase the game even if you didn't participate in the campaign -- or pay for postage, if you did.  
Update, June 27, 2014:The campaign is over. We will publish the game and the adventure in English, and contact each contributor to make sure they get what is theirs.
We made 5,535€ reaching 111% of our goal. We had 109 backers, and did all this in 42 days. We will get the next generation roleplaying.
Thank you!

Update, June 26:
We reached our goal! Thank you so much! This means all of you who believed in the campaign will get at least a PDF copy of Ville Vuorela's fairytale-like adventure for Age of the Tempest. (And whatever else is in your Perk.)
We have seventeen hours to go, and if we raise another 881€, we'll unlock our first stretch goal: a mini monster manual. It's going to be great, so let's keep on rocking on, and remind everyone this is their last chance to jump on board...
 
 
  
 
Update, June 25:
First stretch goal announced! If we reach 6000€, we will release a second supplement: A monster manual. And I hope to make it the best monster manual in the world with not just statistics, but also great pictures, stories, and references to real world science, mythology and psychology from which these creatures come from. All backers will get this as a PDF, and everyone who contributed for 50€ or more will get a physical copy.Let's keep pushing, friends!
Update, June 24:
We have reached our second Social Goal: 1000 shares on Facebook. If we make our goal, everyone who backed the campaign (even if it's for just 1€), will now get a PDF of the supplement. See Updates for more info, and a great sketch from the supplement artist. Let's get those kids roleplaying, friends! :)
Update, June 5:
First Social Goal reached: 500 shares on Facebook! As a thank you we're announcing a collaborative Author's Commentary, and the opportunity to become a playtester! See Updates for more info! And keep spreading the good word! :)
Update, June 3:
We went over 400 shares and 20% of funding yesterday! Thank you!
I also added some links to reviews and news about Age of the Tempest at the bottom of the page. Check them out! :)
Update, May 31:
We've received excellent attention on social media, and you guys have shared this campaign like there's no tomorrow. Thank you! Unfortunately our goal has been badly formulated, and people coming to the site haven't become funders, even though they've loved the concept.
So we're revamping the campaign a little bit: The initial goal is much lower with the aim of creating a fancy supplement for Age of the Tempest. (Later on, we still have the stretch goal of making more translations, but that's too early for now.)
Short Summary
Age of the Tempest is a tabletop roleplaying game for kids and beginners. We crowdfunded it in Finland two years ago, published last year in Finnish, and distributed it to gaming stores, book stores and even supermarkets. Now we want to do the same in English, and later in other languages.
 
We already have the game translated into English, and now we want to get it out there. (You can use this campaign to pre-order your own copy with the Boxed Set and Full Set perks.) If we reach our goal, we'll also publsh a high quality supplement adventure for the game by designer Ville Vuorela, art by Marko Laine. If we reach our 6000€ stretch goal, we'll release a small monster manual.The main motivation for this campaign is to introduce roleplaying to the new generation. Thanks for your help! 
 

Who is this guy?My name is Mike Pohjola, I'm a game designer and writer from Finland. I've written novels, screenplays, transmedia productions, mobile games, stage musicals, comics, and have been recognized for them in the real world with an Emmy nomination, a Prix Europa, and that kind of stuff. But my real passion lies with role-playing games. 
 
I started playing role-playing games in 1988 when my scout master introduced us to the Dungeons & Dragons ""Red Box"" set. Since then I've played and run countless table-top role-playing games and larps, and designed four table-top role-playing games myself.
I'm one of a generation that started playing with the many beginner-friendly games of the late 80s and early 90s. Since then there's always been role-playing games available for us, of increasing complexity, and always speaking to us at a level suitable for our age and interests. So right now there are really many excellent role-playing games for 30-40 year-old experienced gamers.
But there are no role-playing games for a kid of eight or ten or twelve who's kind of interested, but doesn't know where to start. We fixed this problem in Finland last year, and now you and I will to fix this problem around the world!
 
Roleplaying for kids
Age of the Tempest is an entry-level tabletop roleplaying game for kids. Nothing like this has been available for a generation, so it's up to us to remedy the situation.
The story is a fantasy adventure about a group of brave rebels who live in a secret camp in the forest and fight against an evil witch emperor, in the vein of Robin Hood, Star Wars and Knights of the Round Table. And yes, it has lots of strong female characters!
A good introductory roleplaying game and a good kids' roleplaying game are not necessarily the same, but this one is both.
The whole thing begins with a short solo adventure that is an introduction to roleplaying, to the world and the story, and to the basic rules mechanics. (If you remember the Dungeons & Dragons Red Box with Aleena the Cleric and Bargle the Magic-User, then this serves the same purpose.)
After that we take our time explaining all the concepts you need to know when creating a character (from seven exciting archetypes), and so on.
Character creation is fairly streamlined with giving you a few choices (""choose one of two skills/weapons"", ""choose your weakness""), but not forcing you to go through skill lists or anything like that. There's plenty of time for more complex stuff later.
The Game Master's Guide is also targeted for beginners, meaning that if you just got the game as a birthday present this morning, you can run it for your friends at the party in the afternoon. While you're doing that, you learn the tricks of the trade, and eventually will get to do a bit of designing, too.
Most of the GM Guide is a pre-made campaign which continues directly from where the solo adventure left you. It has twists and turns, memorable characters and -- of course -- interesting opponents, puzzles and decisions. I'm a professional writer with experience in writing for children and young adults, so while the story is cool and exciting, it doesn't have any elements that you couldn't have in a Star Wars film or a Harry Potter book.
There are Age of the Tempest clubs and groups springing up all over, some of them with an experienced or adult GM, others where the kids play by themselves. Judging from the feedback, both have worked really well.
I've played the game with my 60+ parents, and my son who's almost four, and all of them have enjoyed it. It would help if he could read, but we're doing ok. (There's one monster that I won't show him until his six, though.)
What We Need
We're not asking your money to make the game. We already have the game! We crowdfunded it two years ago in Finland, and published it last year in Finnish. We have the game design, the story, the art, the lay-out, all the content is there. It's available in Finnish gaming stores, book stores, toy stores, libraries, and even supermarkets, and people are starting role-playing clubs all over the country.
We already have an English translation, and demoed it at the Essen game fair last October.
Next, and this is where you come in, we want to properly publish and distribute the English version in English speaking countries and for those who want it in other countries. And create supplements for it: adventures, new character classes and skills, monster manuals and such.
Our initial goal is an original Age of the Tempest adventure designed by Finnish game design guru Ville Vuorela (of Stalker and Praedor fame).
If we reach 6000€, we'll release a second supplement: A monster manual. And I hope to make it the best monster manual in the world with not just statistics, but also great pictures, stories, and references to real world science, mythology and psychology from which these creatures come from.
If we reach our 50000€ stretch goal, we'll be able to afford a new translation, and have Age of the Tempest available in a third language. We'll contact you then, and have a vote on which language it should be!
So thanks to the people of Finland, we already have the game. Now we need your help to make it available for you! (The game is in no way specific to Finland, international distribution was our secret master plan all along!)

 
What You Get
So what do you get out of it? For me one key motivation was to make sure my own son will have a chance to play role-playing games when he's a few years older. (Actually, I couldn't resist, we're already playing Age of the Tempest. He's almost four years old, and he plays the big brutish warrior guy Stallo.)
The main product of the campaign is, of course, a beautiful boxed set of Age of the Tempest - Sword of the High King. Plus we have tee shirts, wallpapers, and other fancy stuff.
Then, if we get enough funds, we'll be able to make supplements, sequels, adventures, monster manuals, new skills and character classes, prose anthologies, comic books, and apps to help you get further into the world of Age of the Tempest.
If you're feeling really generous, we have some high-end stuff available, as well, such as signed art prints, deluxe edition books, exclusive gaming sessions and more!
The story so far...
 
This whole thing started two years ago with a crowdfunding campaign that I launched in northern Europe's biggest RPG convention Ropecon in Finland. The goal was $12 500 and we made $16 029. Yay!
 
The project back then was to self-publish a prototype thousand-copy print-run of the game in Finnish re-using existing art I'd get from friendly artists. And to use that prototype to convince publishers, distributors, and retailers that they need to make a proper version of this game available for the kids of today.
Things escalated quickly. I got offers of help from artists, proof-readers and many other people, and suddenly we had a plan for getting proper new art for the game. Then we got lots of publicity for the project. Then we made our funding goal in about half of the time we'd reserved for it. It started to look like this would be a pretty well-made prototype.
And then the success of the crowdfunding campaign right here on IndieGoGo convinced Europe's fourth biggest board game publisher Tactic (based in Finland) that there was something to this thing. Boom! Now we had a publisher and a distributor, and a print-run of many thousands. And then together with them, we were able to use the successful crowdfunding campaign to convince retailers that they really have this game on their shelves.
And thus for the first time in twenty years bookstores, toy stores and supermarkets are selling a role-playing game. In a box! And people are buying it. And best of all, kids are playing it! Kids who'd never role-played before. (Also many other beginners, including my parents, who are both over 60.)
The Finnish-language boxed set was published in Ropecon in July 2013. We've shipped the copies to crowdfunders, and are planning sequels and supplements now. 
At the Essen game fair in Germany in Octoboer 2013 we already had an English language prototype under the working title ""Heroes of the Storm"". Now we've settled on Age of the Tempest - Sword of the High King!

 
How your money is used
How will the money from the crowdfunding campaign be used? The exact percentages are dependant on the money we make and the perks selected, but if we make exactly 5000€ and everybody selects the ""Boxed set"" perk for 60€, the money will be divided like this.

Which means if we get 5000€, we'll have enough to make the new adventure supplement. If we get 6000€, we'll make a little monster manual. But if we get more, we'll have new stuff we can make. And (as per our earlier goal), if we make 50000€, we can afford a new translation to bring Age of the Tempest into a third language.
As we go bigger, some percentages go up, others go down. But this is the rough outline. We will keep updating the budget to reflect the current status of the campaign.
 

   
PostageIf you've paid for something physical (such as the game box), and you don't want to pick it up from wherever we happen to be, you will probably have to pay for the postage and packing. (Unless your perk says otherwise.) 
Finland: 13€Europe: 24€Globally: 33€
The only exception to this is, if you just want the Player's Guide without the box. In that case we can send it as a regular letter, and it's only 5€ no matter where you live!
 
RisksNo crowdfunding campaign is entirely without risks, but the ones here aren't too big. 
The worst case scenario is that we don't reach 5000 €, and can't afford a new supplement. But we will still have the game available in English and Finnish, and you get your perks in one of those languages.
After that, we can use the publicity, the good-will, the community, and the interest to generate translations and distribution deals through traditional channels.
But let's make sure it doesn't come to that, but instead we will get lots of supplements and translations, and have Age of the Tempest available in your local supermarket, too!

<h3><strong>The Problem</strong></h3>
<p>Have you ever had your buddies over and wanted to have a big game of Call of Duty, Halo or Madden? Then you realized that you only have one TV and one console, so some of your friends would have to sit and wait? Have you wanted to throw a party for your child but were worried about 20 kids running through your house causing havoc? GameTruck can solve those problems and plenty more!</p>
<p><a href=""http://youtu.be/PPf5O5nNsHk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Here it Comes!!"">Here it Comes!</a> </p>
<p><strong>The Solution!</strong></p>
<p>GameTruck is a mobile video game platform designed to give a premiere console multiplayer experience to groups of people. It's great for parents and kids. Inside the GameTruck trailer there are large flat-screen TV's and console systems like Xbox, Playstation and Wii. Gamers come in and pick from a wall of games to play and off they go. GameTruck is exploring ideas for an education program, taking the power of gaming and using it to educate school age children on a variety of subjects.</p>
<p><strong>Core Values</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Respect the Games:</strong> The GameTruck generation is one that will get to re-experience the thrill of collaboration and playing together. Today’s video games offer great opportunities for learning and socialization. We are here to help parents learn to use games as a tool for socialization rather than as a catalyst for isolation.</li>
<li>
<strong>Respect the Video Game Lifestyle:</strong> GameTruck players get moving! Physical activity and gaming cannot be mutually exclusive. This generation of kids is learning to play in a new way and we are on a mission to show how to embrace the games in a manner that leads to a healthy life style.</li>
<li>
<strong>Respect Mom:</strong> Parents are the decision makers when it comes to gaming and we are here to help you learn how to manage your child’s gaming activities even if you are not a gamer. We will help you not only sort through the labyrinth of games, but also give you core tactics and strategies for creating a positive and healthy gaming environment in her home.</li>
<li>
<strong>Respect Education:</strong> Behind every game is a great mind. Game developers are mathematicians, scientists, computer programmers, and artists. Leveraging the unique connection kids have with gaming to spur their interests in math and science is a core objective of GameTruck. We work with schools to create programs that help kids to explore the possibilities of the world around them.</li>

<p><strong>The Need</strong></p>
<p>We are here at IndieGoGo to get the last amount of funding needed to start business, We've already raised about half of what we need though loans but we've done as much as we can with traditional funding. We're so close, it's so exciting! This business is all about having fun and bringing video games out of the basement! We need $40,000 to complete our funding. The money will go to buying a truck to tow the trailer, the wrap on the truck and the franchise &amp; territory fee's. Remember this is an all or nothing project so I need any support you can give.</p>
<p>Once funding is complete we just have to wait for the trailer to finish construction then we are in business!! The Rewards will start being sent out as soon as the project ends.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or if you have something specific you'd like as a reward, please feel free to send me a message. </p>

<p>Using your tactics to guide these warriors, you will need the help of the kings! These kings boost your Morale, to allow you to gather more wood, or if your doing badly, they will start to try and boost your Morale, to lead you to victory!</p>

We've effectively raised the skill gap in Pokemon by sharing data-driven analytics that the game hasn't shared before.

Few websites can implement new functions as quickly and effectively as ours can due to our passionate working nature.
Our current obstacle is the financial cost to implementing new features because website developers aren't free.
We will look for unique ways to raise money while keeping this project ""ours"" as much as possible.

<p>This indigogo exists soley to fund this project, and pay the team. We have only 1 month to create this game, and they will need to be working full time on it to make it a success! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Hope to Achieve </h3>
<p>The custom game mode will exist as a resource for new players entering Dota via the Netflix Anime. Our main goal is to get them used to the game, learn its mechanics, and prepare them for their first bot match. </p>
<p>Furthermore, we can do what Valve cannot: directly link community resources like discords, content creators, and guide websites to the players so that they may start on a more advanced journey to learn Dota 2. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Understanding Our Limitations </h3>
<p>We are not setting out to make ""the official tutorial for the game"". Our custom game will be affected by the same issues all custom games are, such as breaking as soon as there is a major update (Icefrog removes outposts, and our game has a outpost guide).  WE WILL NOT BE UPDATING OR MAINTAINING this tutorial, unless we have some sort of insane fund raising here. Our goal is simple: <strong>make a tutorial for the current patch, with the current map, talking about current mechanics, at the time of the release of the netflix show to help first time players. </strong></p>
<p>Furthermore, there is currently a 30 game limit on custom games (you must play 30 regular games of dota before accessing custom games). This being a first time players guide, we hope to sway Valve to change this. However, we have no power over Valve, so should they choose to not change this rule we are at their mercy. </p>
<h3>How You Can Help </h3>
</div><div>
<p>Many Dota community members have offered to help or be part of the project! Here is how:</p>
<ul>
<li>donating to the indigogo to fund the mod makers and team will be a huge help, as the team will need to spend their full time to make our insane deadline</li>
<li>at certain levels, donating will allow you to see our scripts and gain access to the direct info. we would love feedback on those scripts and how we could improve! </li>
<li>donators will also be able to suggest community members to be included in the mod, for review. we will add these resources in for new players.</li>
<li>supporting the mod efforts by sharing the update blogs, playtesting the mod, and spreading the word!</li>
<li>help us get the 30 day limit removed by voicing your support! </li>
</ul>
</div></div>","Edit: Minimum Goal Reached! 
Incredibly, we have reached the minimum 10,000$ the moders said would be nice. We are going to add stretch goals to see if we can reach the 50,000$ which they said a normal team would be paid for a mod like this.  This will include trying to get the mod localized for South American and Chinese communities! 

A Simple Goal:

Valve, for a variety of reasons, would have a very hard time making a tutorial for the release of the new Netflix Dota 2 anime. Assuming that there will be an influx of new players brought in from the anime's release, we have banded together as a community to create a tutorial for these new players in the form of a custom game.

selected.</p><p>Each figure has different abilities, some powers are triggered by the passage of turns, each figure has a mode of attack, melee, distance, direction, range, area, and breath, how they combine skills and types of attacks up to you to victory, beating win prestige in the area, which will open new places, other challengers appear, among other benefits.</p><p>If you lose, you lose your coins bet and your miniatures will deteriorate, if your miniatures reach the maximum deterioration you may not use them until you return to your home or use a special object to regenerate, if all your miniatures with traveling reach the maximum of deterioration, your trip is over, you lose prestige, money, and go back to your hometown, be careful how you manage it and risking your miniatures.</p><p>You can increase the number of thumbnails with which you travel buying an expansion for your board, the better prepared further away you travel, you have to take into account the costs of your character and you pay transportation, lodging, food, tournament entries and other things.</p><p>Miniatures: They will be grouped into 4 types according to their power and rarity</p><p> Common (C)<br/> Uncommon (UC)<br/> Rare (R)<br/> Unique (U)</p><p>The meetings may vary by town or region tournament trips.<br/> (1 vs 1) (3 vs 3) (5 vs 5) (7 vs 7)<br/> Bear in mind that you took in choosing your miniatures as the number of thumbnails you put one type will be limited by rarity strategy.</p><p>Example: </p><p>In a standard game of 5 vs 5, you can only use 1 miniature rare maximum, 3 uncommon miniatures maximum or up to 5 maximum common miniatures, you must complete a set of 5 miniatures for the encounter, respecting these limits, in other words you may not put on two rare per encounter, or 4 uncommon.</p><p>1 (R), 1 (UC) and 3 (C) but you cannot make a team of 2 (R), 1 (UC) and 2 (C) because the maximum is 1 rare. </p><p>You can buy more models in 2 ways, the first is the standard collection you can buy a set of 5 or 10 miniatures randomly with coins that you seek the truth, this collection will consist of 50 different figures and every 6 months 10 new figures added to this collection.</p><p>The second is the Premium collections contain 50 different figures come out every 6 months and 50 new figures and can buy in sets of 5 or 10 models randomly, you paid real money.</p><p>What happens to repeated figures or do not want?</p><p>In your home you can store all the thumbnails on your shelves that you can expand later, the figures that

like potions, poisons, antidotes, Geomana less. </p><p>Equipment: These are weapons, armor, you can use them as often as you want as long as you give them maintenance (using Geomana). </p><p>Primordial Objects: These are two very important items and the Geomana Geovita, Geomana are for the maintenance of objects and thumbnails, Geovita are regenerating your models because of the

part to enter the great world of video games representing Mexico, where the platform will start Android, then IOS, and so gradually to expand into all mobile platforms, the game will be distributed F2P (Free to Play) mode.   The Game MiniQuest involves an ancient game of miniature figures sized chess pieces, with heroes and creatures of the past of this world, the adventure begins in the shop of your town that sell those figures that's where you will find the shopkeeper named Gustav, which will explain how the game is, it is the game board, miniatures, objects used in the game and how to start your travel.Gustav will give away the magical board game, which takes the form of diverse terrain of your choice that you unlock with mana crystals (VitroTerram), use the terrain to your advantage.We also explain how the miniatures are classified with which you play - Types of miniatures - Equipment to be used - Objects that you can use - Limits and Basic Rules - As expand the capacity of your board - and moreYou will choose your first miniatures, your first battle ground, and a bag of objects and be ready to travel to collect more miniatures.                                                       All pictures except the logo, they are not finished yet, day by day I will show you the progress of the project, within my means, because part of the proceeds here is for computer equipment to continue developing and designing the gameCampaignsCampaigns are trips that you do with a group of your choicest miniatures which you used in all your battles outside your place of origin, as you fight your miniatures magic ran out so it is very important to instill magic occasionally.If you lose, your miniatures will wear to the point that you cannot use them until you get home and regenerate, and restore magic infuse your miniatures can also do special items that you can buy at the store you visit each village and so can you go farther and have confrontations with various collectors in each village.With each victory you get coins, with which you can buy more miniatures, objects and more, remember that you also carries travel expenses (food, transportation, lodging, your miniatures should not eat or sleep but you do).  TournamentsThe collect and play with miniatures is not all you can also go in search of fame and glory.In some towns and cities have local, regional and kingdoms tournaments, where you will play with all kinds of collectors, some who've seen others that are legend in the game, win fame and not only get more challenging but also will unlock more places to travel, exclusive miniatures, a lot of coins among other things, (do not forget to defend your title in tournament kingdoms, to keep your title of champion of the kingdom). The esenario published here is only illustrative, still working on the design but because my computer is not as powerful my progress has been very slow, so I ask for your support to the project.Dynamic GameThe game basically involves visiting different places and fight local area collectors and some errant players, roads in towns and cities, the achievement of every win coins with which you can buy more packs of figures coming out at random in the each village shop (if available) can also buy items with which maintenance can be given on thumbnails cure or equip them to raise their effectiveness, power, life, among others.The game focuses on the magic board where clashes occur, the board takes the form of a field's choice winner of the coin toss to start the game, then the money to bet that wins the game, depending on how much risk it is the fierceness your opponent to attack you, so be careful with gain much from a single blow, then the figures with which you were faced with your opponent are selected.Each figure has different abilities, some powers are triggered by the passage of turns, each figure has a mode of attack, melee, distance, direction, range, area,

you lose your coins bet and your miniatures will deteriorate, if your miniatures reach the maximum deterioration you may not use them until you return to your home or use a special object to regenerate, if all your miniatures with traveling reach the maximum of deterioration, your trip is over, you lose prestige, money, and go back to your hometown, be careful how you manage it and risking your miniatures.You can increase the number of thumbnails with which you travel buying an expansion for your board, the better prepared further away you travel, you have to take into account the costs of your character and you pay transportation, lodging, food, tournament entries and other things.Miniatures: They will be grouped into 4 types according to their power and rarity Common

We would like to create as many Fantasy Japanese creatures as we can. These miniatures would be used in Kensei Miniature Wargame, but they could also be used in roleplaying games or for artistic painting.
Our friend Adam Ferrando is creating the creature designs for this project, so you can have a new way to look at this fantasy creatures. We are also working in the Kensei rules for every creature or character included in this campaing.
We hope you like this campaign and that you help us reach our goals by sharing it with your friends and choosing one of our Perks.
 
CAMPAÑA DE MINIATURAS FANTÁSTICAS DE KENSEI
Esta es la nueva campaña para conseguir fondos de Kensei. Nuestro objetivo principal es crear una gran serie de miniaturas inspiradas en la mitología Japonesa. Nos gustatía crear tantas criaturas fantásticas como sea posible. Estas miniaturas serán utilizadas en Kensei y también podrán ser usadas para jugar a rol o pintura artística.
Los diseños de este proyecto serán totalmente nuevos, creados por Adam Ferrando, de modo que tendréis la oportunidad de ver estas criaturas desde un nuevo punto de vista. A su vez nosotros ya estamos trabajando en las reglas para cada criatura y personaje incluido en esta campaña.
Esperamos que os guste y que nos ayudeis a alcanzar nuestras metas; compartiendo la campaña con vuestros amigos y seleccionando alguno de nuestros Perk.

We are company with long experience in the miniature world. We love what we do and we love Japanese mythology.

<p>RIAH Media is a brand new innovative outlook on how customer service should be addressed.  It stands for ""Real-time Interactive Advertising Host"". With the successful completion of this Indiegogo Campaign, we plan to simultaneously launch two RIAH Media systems located at shopping centers in the Southern California market and two RIAH Media/Mobile system platforms as well. Of which we already have a functional prototype &amp; green vehicles ready for production. These systems will employ LIVE broadcasters who will be ready to assist you, the customer, in any way possible. The interaction between the LIVE host &amp; consumer is what we call: RIAHtalk. These four systems along with our studio will create the foundation for RIAH Media. The system will not only benefit the gaming industry &amp; customer service, but several other industries as well.  Here's what we have lined up for the launch.</p>
<p><img alt=""Two Southern California RIAH Media Gaming &amp; Entertainment Locations"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1341.photobucket.com/albums/o745/Consumermedia/1.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Two Southern California RIAH Media Gaming &amp; Entertainment Locations""/>Two Southern California RIAH Media Gaming &amp; Entertainment Locations</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gaming Industry</strong></p>
<p>As stated earlier, the Gaming Industry is truly a market the RIAH system will be able to shine in. Game developers (Rockstar North, Bioware, Naughty Dog, etc.) along with game publishers (Microsoft, Sony, Rockstar, etc.) will be able to use our medium to test market their games and devices first hand and get instant feedback from consumers.  Gamers located at our RIAH Media systems will be able to compete with other mobile RIAH Media system gamers in games that will not be available elsewhere for months or even years.  After gaming matches, the gamers will be able to meet the game developers appearing LIVE on RIAHtalk for Question and Answer sessions.  For the first time being able to have their ideas and input have an audience with the gaming industry and hopefully become a part of the finished game.  </p>
<p> This sort of Gaming experience isn't available anywhere else at the moment.  Gamers will be overjoyed and excited that they were able to be a part of an opportunity like this. Not to mention creating quite the hype &amp; interest around the Gaming Industry. Development teams will be able to get direct feedback without having the gamer download anything. This same model can also be applied to games that have just been released. Or even older games in order to regenerate interest. Contests, tournaments, and other events can just as easily be staged on these systems. Our RIAH Media Mobile platform will be able to reach consumers who would otherwise miss out on an opportunity like this.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Product Knowledge and Customer Service</strong></p>
<p>Customer Service is another aspect where RIAH Media will be able to perform exceptionally well. When not playing games or having celebrities appear on RIAHtalk, the RIAH system will provide customer support. At our broadcasting center we will have specialists waiting for you to walk up to the RIAH system and ask a question.  The specialist will always be there ready to assist you in any way possible.  If you need directions in the retail location, they can provide them.  If you need to know which retial location is having the biggest sale, all you need to do is ask.  Just like the celebrity RIAHtalk experience, they can see you and you see them.<br/><br/> Product knowledge is just as important to us here as well. Whether you need assistance finding a product or even a demonstration video on how to use an item, the specialist can pull it up within seconds.  If they don't have the means to assist you with your question they can transfer you immediately to another agent who specializes in the field you need assistance in.  They can also email you literature and brochures about specific products along with instructions and help guides.  You will never have to wander around aimlessly looking for assistance.  You'll always know you can get it instantly at one of our RIAH Media systems free of charge.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Film Industry and Celebrities</strong></p>
<p>The RIAH Media system will benefit the Film Industry immensely by providing a public/industry interaction like never before.  At our studio, we will have celebrities and filmmakers from upcoming releases come in routinely and broadcast live to our RIAH Media systems nationwide through RIAHtalk. Do to the nature of this Industry, we believe Southern California to be the premier location to install our first RIAH systems. Its access to A-List talent and film studios that employ them is unparalleled. At each system, patrons will be lined up, ready to ask their favorite actor or actress a question and be able to talk to them live. You see them and they see you. Here they will answer any questions you'd wish to ask and just generally chat with you.<br/><br/> Likewise, the system is also perfect for anniversaries of classic films or TV shows. You might ask, why not just have a regular public appearances?  Well, a public appearance can only benefit one place at a time. But through the RIAH Media system they can be broadcast to multiple systems simultaneously, worldwide. Wherever there is a fan eager to talk. Just like in the Gaming Industry, this brings up the hype and appeal of the promoted entertainment.  Along with providing filmmakers valued feedback from their fans.  This once in a lifetime moment won't soon be forgotten. All patrons will generally have a positive attitude towards what's being promoted.  Unlike standard advertising practices, this is captivating. This interaction is the main draw of their attention. The system can be used for TV shows, webisodes, celebrity endorsements, athletes connecting with their fans, or just plain entertainment. This sort of connection is easily available through RIAH Media.</p>

<p>Community and City Service is of great importance to us here at Consumermedia.

We can also answer questions about recent big changes in the community or in more important cases; have public officials show up to answer questions LIVE on RIAHtalk. orchestrate</p>

With Indiegogo's help, he plans to bring RIAH MediaTM Technology to every US Market.</p></div>","What is RIAH Media
RIAH Media is a brand new innovative outlook on how customer service should be addressed.  It stands for ""Real-time Interactive Advertising Host"". With the successful completion of this Indiegogo Campaign, we plan to simultaneously launch two RIAH Media systems located at shopping centers in the Southern California market and two RIAH Media/Mobile system platforms as well. Of which we already have a functional prototype & green vehicles ready for production. These systems will employ LIVE broadcasters who will be ready to assist you, the customer, in any way possible. The interaction between the LIVE host & consumer is what we call: RIAHtalk. These four systems along with our studio will create the foundation for RIAH Media. The system will not only benefit the gaming industry & customer service, but several other industries as well.  Here's what we have lined up for the launch.
Two Southern California RIAH Media Gaming & Entertainment Locations
 
The Gaming Industry
As stated earlier, the Gaming Industry is truly a market the RIAH system will be able to shine in. Game developers (Rockstar North, Bioware, Naughty Dog, etc.) along with game publishers (Microsoft, Sony, Rockstar, etc.) will be able to use our medium to test market their games and devices first hand and get instant feedback from consumers.  Gamers located at our RIAH Media systems will be able to compete with other mobile RIAH Media system gamers in games that will not be available elsewhere for months or even years.  After gaming matches, the gamers will be able to meet the game developers appearing LIVE on RIAHtalk for Question and Answer sessions.  For the first time being able to have their ideas and input have an audience with the gaming industry and hopefully become a part of the finished game.  
 This sort of Gaming experience isn't available anywhere else at the moment.  Gamers will be overjoyed and excited that they were able to be a part of an opportunity like this. Not to mention creating quite the hype & interest around the Gaming Industry. Development teams will be able to get direct feedback without having the gamer download anything. This same model can also be applied to games that have just been released. Or even older games in order to regenerate interest. Contests, tournaments, and other events can just as easily be staged on these systems. Our RIAH Media Mobile platform will be able to reach consumers who would otherwise miss out on an opportunity like this.

Product Knowledge and Customer Service
Customer Service is another aspect where RIAH Media will be able to perform exceptionally well. When not playing games or having celebrities appear on RIAHtalk, the RIAH system will provide customer support. At our broadcasting center we will have specialists waiting for you to walk up to the RIAH system and ask a question.  The specialist will always be there ready to assist you in any way possible.  If you need directions in the retail location, they can provide them.  If you need to know which retial location is having the biggest sale, all you need to do is ask.  Just like the celebrity RIAHtalk experience, they can see you and you see them. Product knowledge is just as important to us here as well. Whether you need assistance finding a product or even a demonstration video on how to use an item, the specialist can pull it up within seconds.  If they don't have the means to assist you with your question they can transfer you immediately to another agent who specializes in the field you need assistance in.  They can also email you literature and brochures about specific products along with instructions and help guides.  You will never have to wander around aimlessly looking for assistance.  You'll always know you can get it instantly at one of our RIAH Media systems free of charge.

<p>IslaBomba is the first game made by Sons of a Bit Entertainment, co-founded by Eduardo and Alberto Saldaña (Yes, we are brothers). We have been playing and making videogames as amateurs even before starting to talk (exaggerated version), so we think it was time to release our first complete videogame. This is the dream of our lives. Do you help us?</p>

<p></p>
<p>
</p><p><br/>We've been working on the game partime for half a year and we've come to the conclusion we need your help to finish this exciting project.</p>
<p>We already have some equipment:</p>
<ul>
<li>iPhone 3GS</li>
<li>iPhone 4S</li>
<li>iPad 3rd Gen</li>
<li>MacBook Pro</li>
<li>Some professional pieces of software: Adobe CS5, Maya, Blender, Final Cut Pro, etc.</li>
<li>Midi instruments, screens, scanners, digital tablets etc.</li>
</ul><p>The game is playable, although playability must be polished and we need to create new stages and environments. If you, dear backer, help us, that’s what we’re going to spend your money on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improving graphics, music, physics… Everything.</li>
<li>Getting new devices to test our game. Emulators are not trustworthy.</li>
<li>Getting the pieces of hardware and software we need to make the game exactly as we imagined.</li>
<li>Our office expenses during the development of IslaBomba (light, water, professional Internet connection...)</li>
<li>Testing and bug fixing.</li>
</ul><p style=""text-align: center;""><img alt=""Budget Partition"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://islabomba.com/IMG/tabla-en.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Your contribution will go directly toward the project. We don’t want to buy a new car, we want to make our dreams come true thanks to your generosity.

<p><strong>Q: When will the game be released?</strong></p>
<p>A: We are working hard to release the game at some time in the first 6 months of 2014. We'll confirm the release date ASAP!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: What will happen if you don't meet your goal on Indiegogo?</strong></p>
<p>A: We will release the game, whatever happens. However, if we don't reach our goal, the game will be released on App Store, Mac App Store, Windows and Linux. The console and Android versions will have to wait a little bit.</p>
<p>On the other hand, aspects such as graphics, physics and optimization will be affected.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: I really want to help you, guys. How can I do it if I don't have enough money to contribute?</strong></p>
<p>A: There are many ways of helping us! For example, you can talk about us and IslaBomba to your friends, relatives, neighbours, classmates... Everyone!</p>
<p>If many people visit this campaign and share it on the social media, it will be more visible on Indiegogo website and more people might contribute.</p>
<p>So, if you want to help but you can't contribute with money, just spread the word!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: So, will the game be released on Wii U and PS3?</strong></p>
<p>A: We can't confirm anything yet. What we can say is that the PS3 version is more likely than the Wii U's right now. Stay tuned!</p>

<p>It’s really hard to make great video games. Everything has to be perfect if we want to create an unforgettable experience. However, we are committed to finish the game, whatever it takes. The only risk is that IslaBomba would take longer than expected if we don't reach our goal. But the game will be released anyway, for sure. Don’t worry about that! We know what we are doing!.</p>

<ul>
<li>Desafío para un jugador.</li>
<li>Mezcla perfecta de juegos de acción, puzzles y plataformas.</li>
<li>Traducido al español, inglés, italiano, francés, alemán y portugués.</li>
<li>Para PC, MAC, iOS, Android y XBox Live. Posiblemente también en PSN y WiiU e-shop.</li>
</ul><p>El juego se desarrolla en una pacífica isla en medio del océano llamada IslaBomba. La isla está gobernada por King Nasty, un rey tirano que quiere bombardear las tierras de sus habitantes para construir una pista de paddle, un circuito de karts, una bolera y otras cosas que King Nasty cree vitales para el reino.</p>
<p>Tu misión es arrojar las bombas de King Nasty a diferentes sustancias, tales como agua o arenas movedizas, antes de que la mecha se consuma. Para hacerlo, tomarás el control de tres animales al mismo tiempo, cada uno con características y habilidades únicas:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img alt=""Penguins"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img28.imageshack.us/img28/2197/3iqm.png"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: center;""/></p>
<ul>
<li>Los pingüinos pueden agarrar bombas y lanzarlas lejos.</li>
</ul><p style=""text-align: center;""><img alt=""Rabbits"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img823.imageshack.us/img823/3073/u34.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>Los conejos pueden saltar (¡Sorpresa!) y empujar bombas, así como otros objetos pequeños con su cuerpo.</li>
</ul><p style=""text-align: center;""><img alt=""Turtles"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img826.imageshack.us/img826/3249/qauf.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>Las tortugas pueden cargar con otros animales sobre su caparazón y además son las únicas que pueden pulsar botones con sus patitas para activar diferentes mecanismos.</li>
</ul><p>Junto con las habilidades de los personajes, cada fase incluirá elementos dinámicos, tales como: ráfagas de viento, arenas movedizas, puzles basados en físicas… ¡e incluso bandadas de palomas! Todo esto hará el juego cada vez más variado, divertido y desafiante.</p>

<p>IslaBomba es el primer proyecto de Sons of a Bit, fundada por Eduardo y Alberto Saldaña. Sí, somos hermanos. Hemos estado jugando y haciendo videojuegos como aficionados desde antes incluso de empezar a hablar (dramatización de los hechos), así que creemos que ha llegado la hora de lanzar nuestro primer videojuego comercial. Es el sueño de nuestra vida, ¿nos ayudas?.</p>

<p>
</p><p><br/>Hemos estado trabajando en el juego a tiempo parcial desde hace casi un año y hemos llegado a la conclusión de que necesitamos tu ayuda para finalizar este emocionante proyecto.</p>
<p>Ya disponemos de material en la oficina:</p>
<ul>
<li>iPhone 3GS</li>
<li>iPhone 4S</li>
<li>iPad 3rd Gen</li>
<li>MacBook Pro</li>
<li>Paquetes de software profesinal: Adobe CS5, Maya, Blender, Final Cut Pro, etc.</li>
<li>instrumentos MIDI, monitores, escáner, tableta digitalizadora etc.</li>
</ul><p>El título ya es jugable, pero necesitamos pulir el control, añadir elementos dinámicos y crear nuevas fases y escenarios. Si tú, querido colaborador, nos ayudas, invertiremos el dinero en:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mejorar los gráficos, la música, las físicas... Todo.</li>
<li>Adquirir nuevos dispositivos para probar el juego. Los emuladores no son de fiar.</li>
<li>Hacernos con los kits de desarrollo para PS3 y WiiU.</li>
<li>Sufragar los impuestos y gastos de oficina durante el desarrollo de IslaBomba (luz, agua, conexión profesional a Internet etc.)</li>
<li>Pruebas y solución de errores.</li>
</ul><p style=""text-align: center;""><img alt=""Reparto del presupuesto"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://islabomba.com/IMG/tabla-es.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Tu contribución irá directamente al proyecto. No queremos comprarnos un coche nuevo, queremos hacer nuestro sueño realidad y poder compartirlo con vosotros gracias a vuestra generosidad. Con tu ayuda podemos cubrir algunos de los costes que necesitamos para desarrollar, publicar y vender IslaBomba. Por supuesto, ¡te recompensaremos con geniales regalos por tu ayuda!</p>

Do you want to see how games are made? Have a look at this new video

 


Single-player
Perfect match of puzzle and action games
In English, Spanish, Italian, French, German and Portuguese.
On PC, MAC, iOS, Android and XBox Live. Hopefully, also on PSN and WiiU e-shop
IslaBomba, a peaceful island in the middle of the ocean, is ruled by Nasty, a tyrant king who wants to bomb its inhabitants’ homeland to build a paddle court, a kart circuit, a bowling alley and other important stuff King Nasty obviously needs.
Your mission is to throw King Nasty’s bombs into different substances, such as water or quicksand, before the spark burns the whole fuse. In order to do it, you’ll control three of these inhabitants at the same time, each one of them with unique features and skills:


The penguins can grab bombs and throw them far away.


The rabbits can hop (surprise!) and push bombs with their body.


The turtles can push buttons with their legs and carry other animals on their shell.
Together with the characters’ skills, stages will include dynamic elements, such as: changing wind, quicksand, physics-related puzzles and even flocks of doves! All this will make the game more and more varied, funny and challenging.


 


3 different characters with unique skills.
200 challenging stages.
4 different environments: jungle, desert, ice and an unlockable location only available when finishing the game.
Endless hours of fun and happines.
 Please, have a look at this gameplay video!
 




IslaBomba is the first game made by Sons of a Bit Entertainment, co-founded by Eduardo and Alberto Saldaña (Yes, we are brothers). We have been playing and making videogames as amateurs even before starting to talk (exaggerated version), so we think it was time to release our first complete videogame. This is the dream of our lives. Do you help us?

 


We've been working on the game partime for half a year and we've come to the conclusion we need your help to finish this exciting project.
We already have some equipment:

iPhone 3GS
iPhone 4S
iPad 3rd Gen
MacBook Pro
Some professional pieces of software: Adobe CS5, Maya, Blender, Final Cut Pro, etc.
Midi instruments, screens, scanners, digital tablets etc.
The game is playable, although playability must be polished and we need to create new stages and environments. If you, dear backer, help us, that’s what we’re going to spend your money on:

Improving graphics, music, physics… Everything.
Getting new devices to test our game. Emulators are not trustworthy.
Getting the pieces of hardware and software we need to make the game exactly as we imagined.
Our office expenses during the development of IslaBomba (light, water, professional Internet connection...)
Testing and bug fixing.

Your contribution will go directly toward the project. We don’t want to buy a new car, we want to make our dreams come true thanks to your generosity. With your help we can cover some of the costs of creating, publishing, and selling IslaBomba. Of course, we will give you great rewards for your help!
 


















Up to 30 contributors.


Up to 20 contributors.


Up to 5 contributors.


Only one available.

 
 

Q: When will the game be released?
A: We are working hard to release the game at some time in the first 6 months of 2014. We'll confirm the release date ASAP!
 
Q: What will happen if you don't meet your goal on Indiegogo?
A: We will release the game, whatever happens. However, if we don't reach our goal, the game will be released on App Store, Mac App Store, Windows and Linux. The console and Android versions will have to wait a little bit.
On the other hand, aspects such as graphics, physics and optimization will be affected.
 
Q: I really want to help you, guys. How can I do it if I don't have enough money to contribute?
A: There are many ways of helping us! For example, you can talk about us and IslaBomba to your friends, relatives, neighbours, classmates... Everyone!
If many people visit this campaign and share it on the social media, it will be more visible on Indiegogo website and more people might contribute.
So, if you want to help but you can't contribute with money, just spread the word!
 
Q: So, will the game be released on Wii U and PS3?
A: We can't confirm anything yet. What we can say is that the PS3 version is more likely than the Wii U's right now. Stay tuned!
 
If you have any other questions, please send an email to info@sonsofabit.com

It’s really hard to make great video games. Everything has to be perfect if we want to create an unforgettable experience. However, we are committed to finish the game, whatever it takes. The only risk is that IslaBomba would take longer than expected if we don't reach our goal. But the game will be released anyway, for sure. Don’t worry about that! We know what we are doing!.

 

 

 
¡Actualización!
¿Quieres ver cómo se hace un videojuego? ¡Echa un vistazo a nuestro nuevo vídeo!

 


Desafío para un jugador.
Mezcla perfecta de juegos de acción, puzzles y plataformas.
Traducido al español, inglés, italiano, francés, alemán y portugués.
Para PC, MAC, iOS, Android y XBox Live. Posiblemente también en PSN y WiiU e-shop.
El juego se desarrolla en una pacífica isla en medio del océano llamada IslaBomba. La isla está gobernada por King Nasty, un rey tirano que quiere bombardear las tierras de sus habitantes para construir una pista de paddle, un circuito de karts, una bolera y otras cosas que King Nasty cree vitales para el reino.
Tu misión es arrojar las bombas de King Nasty a diferentes sustancias, tales como agua o arenas movedizas, antes de que la mecha se consuma. Para hacerlo, tomarás el control de tres animales al mismo tiempo, cada uno con características y habilidades únicas:


Los pingüinos pueden agarrar bombas y lanzarlas lejos.


Los conejos pueden saltar (¡Sorpresa!) y empujar bombas, así como otros objetos pequeños con su cuerpo.


Las tortugas pueden cargar con otros animales sobre su caparazón y además son las únicas que pueden pulsar botones con sus patitas para activar diferentes mecanismos.
Junto con las habilidades de los personajes, cada fase incluirá elementos dinámicos, tales como: ráfagas de viento, arenas movedizas, puzles basados en físicas… ¡e incluso bandadas de palomas! Todo esto hará el juego cada vez más variado, divertido y desafiante.

 


3 personajes diferentes con habilidades únicas.
200 fases desafiantes y divertidas.
4 escenarios diferentes: el bosque, el desierto, las cumbres heladas y una ubicación secreta que estará visible una vez el jugador complete todas las demás.
Infinitas horas de diversión garantizadas.
 Por favor, echa un vistazo al siguiente vídeo del Gameplay pre-alpha:
 




IslaBomba es el primer proyecto de Sons of a Bit, fundada por Eduardo y Alberto Saldaña. Sí, somos hermanos. Hemos estado jugando y haciendo videojuegos como aficionados desde antes incluso de empezar a hablar (dramatización de los hechos), así que creemos que ha llegado la hora de lanzar nuestro primer videojuego comercial. Es el sueño de nuestra vida, ¿nos ayudas?.

 


Hemos estado trabajando en el juego a tiempo parcial desde hace casi un año y hemos llegado a la conclusión de que necesitamos tu ayuda para finalizar este emocionante proyecto.
Ya disponemos de material en la oficina:

iPhone 3GS
iPhone 4S
iPad 3rd Gen
MacBook Pro
Paquetes de software profesinal: Adobe CS5, Maya, Blender, Final Cut Pro, etc.
instrumentos MIDI, monitores, escáner, tableta digitalizadora etc.
El título ya es jugable, pero necesitamos pulir el control, añadir elementos dinámicos y crear nuevas fases y escenarios. Si tú, querido colaborador, nos ayudas, invertiremos el dinero en:

Mejorar los gráficos, la música, las físicas... Todo.
Adquirir nuevos dispositivos para probar el juego. Los emuladores no son de fiar.
Hacernos con los kits de desarrollo para PS3 y WiiU.
Sufragar los impuestos y gastos de oficina durante el desarrollo de IslaBomba (luz, agua, conexión profesional a Internet etc.)
Pruebas y solución de errores.

Tu contribución irá directamente al proyecto. No queremos comprarnos un coche nuevo, queremos hacer nuestro sueño realidad y poder compartirlo con vosotros gracias a vuestra generosidad. Con tu ayuda podemos cubrir algunos de los costes que necesitamos para desarrollar, publicar y vender IslaBomba. Por supuesto, ¡te recompensaremos con geniales regalos por tu ayuda!

We want to accomplish our dreams and goals working in our own enterprise. We started working in mobile applications development for our own way with the name of Cattleya Studios, we make our first app in around 4 months and we launch it, but we don't make much with this, and in that moment we understood that we need help of people for make our project and achieve our goals.

Since the beginning we have learned a lot for our own way, because in our country this is just beginning and we don’t have roads where we can guide yet, but we want learn and work, we really think that if you fight for the things that you want you can do it.

<h2><br/></h2>
<p>When we started this game, we never thought it would become the huge masterpiece it is today! We thought that it would be something that we could do on our spare time... </p>
<p>But as time progressed, the game development progress slowed down. As mentioned before, the minigames are a whole new engine to code and to make a different art style for. </p>
<p>Almost all of the puzzles are unique, and there is no copy pasting puzzle-code! They take time and care to fully implement into the game. And there are many to do...</p>
<p>Most of our time we would like to put into making this game goes to other jobs, just so we can pay the rent and everything else a normal life contains.</p>
<p>So, after 7 months of hard work, we decided to try out crowdfunding! To see if we can reach out to you, to see if we can make you see the beauty in this game, and help us out by giving us the time back to start working on it fulltime!</p>

Fran Bow is a Horror Point and click game that tells the story of Fran, a young girl struggling with a mental disorder and an unfair destiny. It is a trip to the deepest and darkest side of human psychology, delivered through blood and tears.
After being witness of the gruesome (and mysterious) loss of her parents, found dismembered at their home Fran runs away into the woods, together with her only friend: Mr. Midnight, a black cat that Fran had previously received as a present from her parents. In the forest, Fran loses senses and when she recovers, she is at Oswald Asylum, an oppressive mental institution for children, with no trace of Mr. Midnight.After having a dream about her beloved cat she decides to escape the institution to find him and go back to aunt Grace. Aunt Grace is her only living relative who she is very fond of.Nothing comes easy for Fran. There is also a strange creature, Remor, who wants to prevent Fran Bow from going home at any cost. But she is determined to find her cat, return to aunt Grace and together find out who is responsible for her parents murders.
 

 



Story driven psychological horror adventure game


Unique and peculiar hand drawn 2D Art-Style


Self-administer medication to open the terrible hidden world that will help solve puzzles and find objects


A bizarre variety of puzzles designed in different levels of difficulty and mostly based on the twisted relationship between Fran Bow's imagination and reality


Old Arcade inspired mini-games designed to be part of the transitions in the story


Interactive and occasionally playable pet cat, Mr Midnight


Several interactive characters with unique personalities that will help or prevent Fran Bow going home


      




When we started this game, we never thought it would become the huge masterpiece it is today! We thought that it would be something that we could do on our spare time... 
But as time progressed, the game development progress slowed down. As mentioned before, the minigames are a whole new engine to code and to make a different art style for. 
Almost all of the puzzles are unique, and there is no copy pasting puzzle-code! They take time and care to fully implement into the game. And there are many to do...
Most of our time we would like to put into making this game goes to other jobs, just so we can pay the rent and everything else a normal life contains.
So, after 7 months of hard work, we decided to try out crowdfunding! To see if we can reach out to you, to see if we can make you see the beauty in this game, and help us out by giving us the time back to start working on it fulltime!
             
 

We have done the first chapter and finishing the second one right now. There are still 3 to do! Natalia needs to draw and animate everything and Isak has lots to code! 
We haven't had any time to implement sound nor music, except for placeholder examples. We want a very unique sound design for it, and are able to do it, with time allowing.
 

We are aiming at a multi-platform release! That means Linux, Mac, iOS, Android, Windows, WP8 and Win 8! It could all be possible!
 

Where would my money go?

If we can raise the amount of money, then we could stay away from the other jobs we have and lock ourselves inside our home office and work with the game 200%! We would need to be able to pay the costs of living and making the game!
If by a weird chance of luck we get above what we ask for, we could hire another programmer and test it on more devices and platforms! And also translate it other languages!


What do I get, other than our eternal gratitude?
By contributing you will first of all get our gratitude, I mean really, you will get it! Whatever help you give means a lot!
After that, depending on the amount, you get alot of cool stuff we are able to make from our home! Most of it will be digital, because that's more enviromental friendly, but some perks will need to be sent by post! And because there are only two of us, we will not promise perks that we cannot deliver!

<h2>Capitol Bells</h2>
<h3>Real Democracy.</h3>
<p>In April I first launched <a href=""http://bit.ly/1923qt6"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Capitol Bells</a>, a free iOS app that tells you when Congress is voting using a radio receiver I installed near the Capitol that picks up signals from their internal notification system.

<p>This month, I released a massive update to invite the public to join their Representatives in this new virtual Congress. It lets you watch the progress of live votes, find all the bill details, plug into the social media discussion, and actually vote alongside your Representative on the app.</p>

</p><p>Have you ever felt like this?: You get a new piece of
equipment, then you have to dream up ways of making it more efficient. Last summer we got an Allen &amp; Heath QU16
digital sound mixer! It was amazing! Good quality sound, easy-to-use controls. </p>
<p>BUT, often we needed to control it remotely. A&amp;H only
worked with “apple”, which we didn’t have. At this point the brainstorming began.

</div>","History
Have you ever felt like this?: You get a new piece of
equipment, then you have to dream up ways of making it more efficient. Last summer we got an Allen & Heath QU16
digital sound mixer! It was amazing! Good quality sound, easy-to-use controls. 
BUT, often we needed to control it remotely. A&H only
worked with “apple”, which we didn’t have. At this point the brainstorming began.
Some hours later we had made a simple interface to control the input channels. There
was no stopping us now! There were more and more new needs and ideas:
equalizer, outputs, etc. 

Now we have a software with working functions (mixing,
load/store scenes, customize channel labels and colors, 4 channel PEQ, Mute,
Panorama, etc.). You can download it from Google Play.  We have even more ideas to make it extra efficient:
make a customizable interface, develop
all other functions. Sadly we have no way to use the mixer for developing and
testing purposes. That’s why we started this project. We would like to make a
professional software for QU owner sound engineers. Please help us with a donation

<p><strong>Err.. ok? So what do you want from us then?</strong></p>
<p>Right now, we want to introduce the game to the United Kingdom!</p>
<p><strong>But it's an app, just release it in the UK then?</strong></p>
<p>No can do! The game is free of charge, got no ads, and it takes lots of manual work to expand to new countries, make zones everywhere and make the neccessary marketing. Plus new servers and all the other stuff the users never notice.</p>
<p>Trust us, we know from the previous expansion in Scandinavia.</p>
<p><strong>So your plan is to make a great, free, game and make absolutely no money from it?</strong></p>
<p>Well, yes and no. Personally we need no money since we got real nice jobs already. But the project needs funding. Especially servers and marketing doesn't come for free.</p>
<p><strong>Ok, the cause might be legit. But is the game any fun?</strong></p>
<p>It sure is! Imagine a game where people WANT to bike, run, walk, inline, board around several hours every day. It's got to be giving some adrenaline and fun to the users in order to accomplish that. Did we mention Turf has been in loads of newspapers, radio, national tv, etc.?</p>

<p></p></div>","withFire aims to change lives through gaming. It is a company established to donate a portion of profits to community-chosen charities beginning at 35% from the first game. The plan is to begin developing games for mobile devices and to push out into the PC and console markets as the company grows. Who is withFire?My name is David Saxon and currently I'm a one-man team but I plan to expand into a small team in the future. I'm from Wellington, New Zealand and am a recent graduate of computer science. Basically, I love making games.Why not give more than 35%?The plan is to donate 35% of all profits to charity and to increase this percentage as the company grows. The rest of the money will go towards keeping the company afloat and expanding the team.Which charities will withFire support?That's the best part - the charities will be chosen by the community (to an extent, we don't want the money going to someone's personal charity to pay their rent... lol). The charities will be chosen online through a suggestion and voting system.Disclaimer: This is nothing like curling.Extreme Curling is the first game withFire will release. In this game you must dodge obstacles, collect power-ups and coins, get crazy speed from boosts, and hit sweet jumps in order to get the farthest possible distance. The game will be free-to-play and free of advertising.What features are in the game?There are two main game modes:
High Score mode: You compete against a global score board to hold the farthest distance reached on a procedurally-generated course.
Challenge mode: You must complete objectives (such as hitting all speed boosts) on increasingly difficult courses. 

Extreme Curling will also have an in-game store where you can spend coins collected in levels to purchase new things such as:
Areas: New areas to go extreme curling in such as a frozen river, a volcano, or 80's Sci-Fi.
Curling stones: More curling stones with improved abilities such as legs for better manoeuvring, helicopter blades or wings to get more air, and armour for better survival.
Power-ups: Add additional power-ups to the game to make it even crazier!
What platforms will Extreme Curling be released on?It is currently being developed for Android devices, but any money above the funding goal will be used to bring the game to iOS devices.Why does Extreme Curling need my money?The foundation of the game is complete but there is still a lot more to be done. The game requires an in-game store, more curling stones, more levels, better effects, and more music and sound effects before its release.What is Omicron?You may have noticed in the trailer that Extreme Curling is powered by Omicron. Omicron is my own engine for Android that I have been working on for the past year. Ideally it will eventually be available for public use.Wallpapers: $5+Get a set of digital wallpapers of Extreme Curling.Official Soundtrack: $35+Get a digital copy of the Official Extreme Curling Soundtrack plus the music from the promo video.T-shirt: $75+Get either a withFire or Extreme Curling T-shirt. If you purchase this perk just leave a comment to specify which one you prefer, your size, and whether you would like the male or female style.Both T-shirts: $150+Get both the withFire and the Extreme Curling T-shirts. Wear both at once and you can look twice as cool.Major Funder: $250+Be listed in the credits as a funder of Extreme Curling and withFire.Design a Curling Stone: $500+Got an idea for an extreme curling stone. Work with withFire to design a curling stone that will be available to use in the game. 5 to be claimed.Design an Area: $1000+Work with withFire to design an area that is playable in the game. 2 to be claimed.Other than contributing, the biggest thing you can do is share this campaign.

quality miniatures for Fantasy Football. We offer alternative designs to
 the ones existing and we provide the players with a wide variety of 
miniatures to help them complete their teams. To achieve this, we always 
work beside the most talented sculptors. </p><p> You can see our full catalogue and contact us here: <a href=""http://www.meikominiatures.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.meikominiatures.com/</a> </p><p></p><p align=""justify"">You
 can also see our previous Meiko Lizardmen Campaign. That campaign 
successfully ended on March 31st of 2013. All the packages were shipped 
before June 30th, so in less than 3 months after the campaign ended up, 
accomplishing the estimated shipment date of Late Spring 2013:</p><p><a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/meiko-miniatures-lizardmen-fantasy-football-team"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/meiko-miniatures-lizardmen-fantasy-football-team</a>
</p><h3><br/></h3><h3>Why crowdfunding? </h3><p></p>
<p align=""justify"">Not so long ago, Meiko Miniatures released the Lizardmen Team, and we have been showing the initial greens of our next team, the Chaos Dwarf Team. All these greens are receiving good reviews from our customers, so we decided to release a whole Chaos Dwarf Team as soon as possible. The Chaos Dwarf Team will include: 6 Hobgoblins, 6 Chaos Dwarves, 2 Bull Centaurs, 1 Minotaur and 4 Star Players: Chaos Dwarf Blunderbuss, Hobgoblin Assassin, Bull Centaur Star Player and Minotaur Star Player. Also, this campaign will include several more items: Stunned / Prone markers for Bull Centaurs and Minotaurs, racial RR markers, racial Dice Bags, Chaos Dwarf Plastic Gaming Mat, racial Range Ruler, racial T-Shirts, Sprint Dice…</p><p align=""justify"">The sculpting of most of these miniatures has been already made. But we need your help to speed up the casting process. That way, we will be able to release the Meiko Chaos Dwarf Team much sooner than when was initially planned. Using Indiegogo as a platform to rise funds helps us a lot since we can finance new miniatures and other interesting items, obtain feedback from our customers and it gives us confidence to keep working on. In exchange you will get some cool rewards.</p>
<p align=""justify"">All the miniatures will be casted in metal, including the Chaos Dwarf Turn Counter and the Stunned / Prone markers. The master moulds will be made by Miniaturas Alemany, the mouldmaker of other successful Fantasy Football Indiegogo campaigns like the Chaos Team and the two Halfling Teams of Willy Miniatures.</p><p align=""justify"">All the miniatures include round bases. Each Chaos Dwarf and Hobgoblin comes with one 25 mm standard round base and each Bull Centaur and Minotaur comes with one 40 mm round base. </p>
<p align=""justify"">The scultptor of this Chaos Dwarf Team is Franarcilla, skilled sculptor of many other Meiko teams like the Ogre, Goblin, Rotter, Orc and Wood Elf Teams, just to mention some of them. He will also sculpt the Chaos Dwarf Turn Counter, a great accessory for a great team. Franarcilla is one of Meiko Miniatures flagship sculptors. His dark sculpting style specially fits with all the chaotic races, and his Chaos Dwarf minis will fit with the image we all have in mind when we think about Chaos Dwarves. Currently, Franarcilla is considered by many Fantasy Football fans as one of the best and most talented Fantasy Football sculptors worldwide.</p><p align=""justify""></p><p><b></b></p><span style=""color: red;""><h3><b>NEW LEVEL!!!</b></h3></span> <p></p><p align=""justify"">Due to your expressed suggestions in different forums and though Facebook feedback, we have decided to make a new perk for our Meiko Chaos Dwarf Team. A more affordable team (<b>just 75 EUR!!!</b>) than the more complete options that we already had, but enough still to give our funders a minimum roster to complete their Chaos Dwarf Teams. This is the <b>NEW 12 PLAYERS TEAM LEVEL!!! </b>This Team will include 2 Bull Centaurs, 6 Chaos Dwarves and 4 Hobgoblins (Hobgoblin nº 1, 2, 3 and 4) .</p><p></p><p align=""justify""><u>This new level will be considered a Level 10 or higher in terms of Strech Goals</u>. That means that everybody who gets this “12 Players Team Level” will get all the Strech Goals stated on the campaign. For example, if the campaign reaches  the 5.500 EUR,you will get for free a human size miniature (7’95 EUR retail price or lower), from the whole Meiko Miniatures catalogue, except on new released miniatures.</p><p></p><p align=""justify"">If you are a Funder who have already got other Perk options but you prefer this new perk instead, when campaign ends contact us to change it and you will be compensated with other perks of your choice, or be refunded with the difference to your Paypal account. Just choose the option you like the most.</p><p></p><p align=""justify"">Also, we have decided to change Level 14 (which was composed of 5 teams of 14 players) for a <b>new version of Level 14 </b>with 5 teams of 12 players…<b> for just 350 EUR</b>!!!! We hope these modifications will encourage you to support our campaign.</p><p></p><p align=""justify"">From now on, and as a Meiko trademark policy, <b>it will not be possible to get any crowdfunded team with the same price or lower than the price stated on the campaign where the team belongs</b>. This will be applied on all the online forums, all the online stores as Comixininos, other partners which distribute Meiko miniatures and also to the future Meiko Miniatures e-shop. We will not offer any discount or special offers for teams that come from a crowdfunding campaign. <u>With this policy, we want to thank our backers their effort and trust in our crowdfunding campaigns</u>.</p><p></p><p align=""justify"">In addition, <b>the configuration</b> with which the team will be commercialized once the campaign ends <b>will not be the same</b> as in the crowdfunding campaign. We want to reward our funders with an optimal configuration for any game so they can get the best for less money than after it will be funded. So the composition with which this team will be put on sale after the campaign can be not so complete as it is in the Indiegogo campaign. For example, <u>team with 2 Bullcentaurs and Minotaur will be only available on Indiegogo</u>. Once the campaign ends, they will never be commercialized together again.</p><p></p><p align=""justify""><br/>In other words... it’s now or never, take advantage now!!! These <b>low prices, team composition, Strechgoal Perks and worldwide FREE SHIPPING</b> are not going to last much longer¡¡¡ <b>Just during this Indiegogo campaign¡¡¡</b></p><p>We hope you make the most of this campaign and help us to get our goal.</p><p>Thanks for your support!!</p><p></p><p><br/></p><p align=""justify""> </p><h3>Howo these Chaos Dwarves look like?</h3><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/318932/files/20140120055917-completeteam.png?1390226357"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">How can you support this team?</span><br/></p><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">LEVEL 1</span><br/></p><p><i>If you are already a contributor to this campaign</i>, you can claim this perk to get the Metal Turn or RR Marker for just 4 EUR!

</div>","About us Meiko Miniatures is a small company producing high 
quality miniatures for Fantasy Football. We offer alternative designs to
 the ones existing and we provide the players with a wide variety of 
miniatures to help them complete their teams. To achieve this, we always 
work beside the most talented sculptors.  You can see our full catalogue and contact us here: http://www.meikominiatures.com/ You
 can also see our previous Meiko Lizardmen Campaign. That campaign 
successfully ended on March 31st of 2013. All the packages were shipped 
before June 30th, so in less than 3 months after the campaign ended up, 
accomplishing the estimated shipment date of Late Spring 2013:http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/meiko-miniatures-lizardmen-fantasy-football-team
Why crowdfunding? 
Not so long ago, Meiko Miniatures released the Lizardmen Team, and we have been showing the initial greens of our next team, the Chaos Dwarf Team. All these greens are receiving good reviews from our customers, so we decided to release a whole Chaos Dwarf Team as soon as possible. The Chaos Dwarf Team will include: 6 Hobgoblins, 6 Chaos Dwarves, 2 Bull Centaurs, 1 Minotaur and 4 Star Players: Chaos Dwarf Blunderbuss, Hobgoblin Assassin, Bull Centaur Star Player and Minotaur Star Player. Also, this campaign will include several more items: Stunned / Prone markers for Bull Centaurs and Minotaurs, racial RR markers, racial Dice Bags, Chaos Dwarf Plastic Gaming Mat, racial Range Ruler, racial T-Shirts, Sprint Dice…The sculpting of most of these miniatures has been already made. But we need your help to speed up the casting process. That way, we will be able to release the Meiko Chaos Dwarf Team much sooner than when was initially planned. Using Indiegogo as a platform to rise funds helps us a lot since we can finance new miniatures and other interesting items, obtain feedback from our customers and it gives us confidence to keep working on. In exchange you will get some cool rewards.
All the miniatures will be casted in metal, including the Chaos Dwarf Turn Counter and the Stunned / Prone markers. The master moulds will be made by Miniaturas Alemany, the mouldmaker of other successful Fantasy Football Indiegogo campaigns like the Chaos Team and the two Halfling Teams of Willy Miniatures.All the miniatures include round bases. Each Chaos Dwarf and Hobgoblin comes with one 25 mm standard round base and each Bull Centaur and Minotaur comes with one 40 mm round base. 
The scultptor of this Chaos Dwarf Team is Franarcilla, skilled sculptor of many other Meiko teams like the Ogre, Goblin, Rotter, Orc and Wood Elf Teams, just to mention some of them. He will also sculpt the Chaos Dwarf Turn Counter, a great accessory for a great team. Franarcilla is one of Meiko Miniatures flagship sculptors. His dark sculpting style specially fits with all the chaotic races, and his Chaos Dwarf minis will fit with the image we all have in mind when we think about Chaos Dwarves. Currently, Franarcilla is considered by many Fantasy Football fans as one of the best and most talented Fantasy Football sculptors worldwide.NEW LEVEL!!! Due to your expressed suggestions in different forums and though Facebook feedback, we have decided to make a new perk for our Meiko Chaos Dwarf Team. A more affordable team (just 75 EUR!!!) than the more complete options that we already had, but enough still to give our funders a minimum roster to complete their Chaos Dwarf Teams. This is the NEW 12 PLAYERS TEAM LEVEL!!! This Team will include 2 Bull Centaurs, 6 Chaos Dwarves and 4 Hobgoblins (Hobgoblin nº 1, 2, 3 and 4) .This new level will be considered a Level 10 or higher in terms of Strech Goals. That means that everybody who gets this “12 Players Team Level” will get all the Strech Goals stated on the campaign. For example, if the campaign reaches  the 5.500 EUR,you will get for free a human size miniature (7’95 EUR retail price or lower), from the whole Meiko Miniatures catalogue, except on new released miniatures.If you are a Funder who have already got other Perk options but you prefer this new perk instead, when campaign ends contact us to change it and you will be compensated with other perks of your choice, or be refunded with the difference to your Paypal account. Just choose the option you like the most.Also, we have decided to change Level 14 (which was composed of 5 teams of 14 players) for a new version of Level 14 with 5 teams of 12 players… for just 350 EUR!!!! We hope these modifications will encourage you to support our campaign.From now on, and as a Meiko trademark policy, it will not be possible to get any crowdfunded team with the same price or lower than the price stated on the campaign where the team belongs. This will be applied on all the online forums, all the online stores as Comixininos, other partners which distribute Meiko miniatures and also to the future Meiko Miniatures e-shop. We will not offer any discount or special offers for teams that come from a crowdfunding campaign. With this policy, we want to thank our backers their effort and trust in our crowdfunding campaigns.In addition, the configuration with which the team will be commercialized once the campaign ends will not be the same as in the crowdfunding campaign. We want to reward our funders with an optimal configuration for any game so they can get the best for less money than after it will be funded. So the composition with which this team will be put on sale after the campaign can be not so complete as it is in the Indiegogo campaign. For example, team with 2 Bullcentaurs and Minotaur will be only available on Indiegogo. Once the campaign ends, they will never be commercialized together again.In other words... it’s now or never, take advantage now!!! These low prices, team composition, Strechgoal Perks and worldwide FREE SHIPPING are not going to last much longer¡¡¡ Just during this Indiegogo campaign¡¡¡We hope you make the most of this campaign and help us to get our goal.Thanks for your support!! Howo these Chaos Dwarves look like?How can you support this team?LEVEL 1If you are already a contributor to this campaign, you can claim this perk to get the Metal Turn or RR Marker for just 4 EUR! It will be shipped together with your other perks of Level 3 or higher.LEVEL 2If you are already a contributor to this campaign, you can claim this perk to get one Hobgoblin for just 7 EUR! We hope this level will help you to complete your team. Please let us know the number of the Hobgoblin that you wish after claiming this perk. It will be shipped together with your other perks of Level 3 or higher.If you wish two (or more) Hobgoblins to complete your team, you will need to claim two times (or more times) this Perk.In case you forget to let us know which Perk you wish, once the campaign ends up we'll contact you by e-mail to know which Perk you prefer.

<p><strong>Developing a game requires a lot of time, dedication and effort.</strong></p>
<p>With my past as a store manager for a big german computer chain I know very well how to dedicate myself to a task and with 2.5 years in which I spent most of my short spare time on developing this game I have already invested a lot of effort into this project.</p>
<p>The problem I need your help in solving is freeing up the time I need to concentrate more on <strong>Cars Incorporated</strong>. Most of the time I could spend developing this game for you I need to work on my regular job as a self-employed computer technican, so I have a roof over my head and enough to eat.</p>
<strong>The target of this Indiegogo-campaign </strong>is to raise enough funds to allow me to focus on development for at least half a year, essentially <strong>turning</strong> this project into a full-time-job. Every penny earned through this campaign will go towards accelerating the development and will get the game into or at least close to the beta-phase (v0.80) in early 2014 for a targeted release in mid-2014 - a task which would likely take several years otherwise. Essentially you can put the development of this game on the fast track by backing it up. And <strong>you </strong>can come along for the ride, play through dozens of alpha and beta versions, give feedback and ideas and help make this <strong>your </strong>game.<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What happens if the campaign fails?</strong></p>
<p>Contributions towards the campaign will not be in vain. As I said the money is used to free up time to work on the game instead of having to make money otherwise and even an amount of just 100 Euro will take 1-2 weeks off the waiting time as it allows me to work 1-2 days fulltime on the game. So even in the worst case this campaign already has shortened the waiting time for the next release.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Cars Incorporated will definitely be completed. Over 60 people have already preordered and paid for the game prior to this campaign and I owe it to these people to see this project to it's proper end. Even preparations for actually producing the boxed version have been done and at least a small batch of 300 copies will be produced, more depending on how well they sell. So yes: All perks will be fulfilled.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The only difference is how long it takes for the game to be completed and whether or not there will be an add-on. So contribute now and help spread the word to fast-track the development of <strong>Cars Incorporated</strong>.</p>

<h3> </h3>
But even without contributing to this campaign you can support Cars Incorporated by simply making people aware of it. And you can even win the game in digital and boxed versions, T-Shirts, access to development steps between releases and - if the campaign is successful - even cash prices paid from my own pocket.<p></p>
<p>All you have to do is use the tools provided by Indiegogo further up on this page to promote this campaign. If you are logged in when doing so Indiegogo can track how many people you sent here. Just be sure to send them here, not to the game's homepage as that can not be counted by Indiegogo.</p>
<p>For each referral (unique visitor) you will receive 1 point. Every Euro contributed by one of your referrals (limited to those Indiegogo could track) will give you 5 points. The 5 highest ranking people at the end of the campaign will receive the following prices:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>1. Price<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Will receive the Perk ""The Big Box"" for free. This includes immediate alpha-access, an autographed boxed copy with your key once the game is completed, access to the development versions and a cool T-Shirt with one of your ingame build cars on it.<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>If the campaign raises the initial goal of 6.600 Euro the winner will also get 100 € from me by PayPal or German/EU wire transfer (not taken from the funds raised).<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>2. &amp; 3. Price<br/></strong></p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>4. &amp; 5. Price<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Will receive the Perk ""Alpha Package"" for free. This means a digital copy of the game with immediate alpha access.<br/></strong></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><img alt=""Stretch Goals"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cars-inc-game.com/images/promo/promo-funds.png"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></h3>
<p>All funds raised by this crowdfunding campaign will go into the faster development and growth of <strong>Cars Incorporated</strong>, as well as into the further expansion of the game and the covering of production costs for physical perks.</p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""€ 6000 Initial Goal"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cars-inc-game.com/images/promo/fund6000.png"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: top;""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hitting this target will allow me to concentrate on the development for at least half a year. This will get the game into or at least close to the Beta Phase in the first quarter of 2014. Upon arriving in the beta phase all major features will be implemented.</p>
<p>Hitting this target will not only decrease the time required to get into Beta but it will also increase the amount of detail I can care about during development.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""€ 10000 Completion Goal"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cars-inc-game.com/images/promo/fund10000.png"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hitting this target will take the game all the way to the finish line, giving me the funds and time I need to get the game through the Beta Phase and on to the release version 1.00. When the game hits version 1.00 a limited amount of physical copies and other physical perks will be professionally manufactured and sent to those who ordered them.</p>
<p>This point will be reached eventually even if no or not enough funds are raised, but hitting this target will greatly speed things up.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""€ 15000 Add On Goal"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cars-inc-game.com/images/promo/fund15000.png"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: text-bottom;""/></p>
<p>If this target is hit, the game will be produced in one run and upon completion the add-on that is currently under consideration will be produced immediately. The add-on will add a driving simulation to the game, allowing you to test your cars or drive them in races yourself. It will also expand the playable timespan into the future and add future technologies to the new game years.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Funding beyond"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cars-inc-game.com/images/promo/fundbeyond.png"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Funds received beyond the required goals for completing the game AND the add-on will of course not go to waste. In fact there are many ways how more funds would benefit the game. Starting with additional time to make an even better game at no extra wait since most of you can play all the alpha versions, all the way to potential paid help such as a composer or a graphics artists to make the game even better. If it appears likely that more than 15.000 Euro will be raised you can post your ideas on how to use the money to improve the game in the comments, additional stretch goals will be added.</p>
<p>Funds that remain after <strong>Cars Incorporated</strong> is finished and I don't see other ways to improve this game will be used on my next game.</p>
<p><img alt=""The Future"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cars-inc-game.com/images/promo/promo-versions.png"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: text-bottom;""/></p>
<p> Most of the planed features such as an ingame newspaper, stock markets, a patent system or bulk orders (e.g. by the police or a cab company) will be added over time, usually in smaller updates. Below you will find a short list of the main targets for the major updates.</p>
<h2>
<br/>v0.30 - Components Update</h2>
<p>(<em>Already in development</em>) This update will introduce small components. Some of these will need to be placed in the body editor such as mirrors or headlights. Others can be added to improve your cars in general such as turbo-chargers or seat belts.</p>
<p>This update will also add the 3rd body generation and increase the playable timespan to 1950.</p>
<h2>v0.40 - Community Update</h2>
<p>This update will let the game go online (if desired). It will include multiplayer sessions by internet, allow you to share your successes via social media or add your topsellers to an online-highscore.</p>
<p>You will also be able to upload your companies from completed games and let your friends or strangers try to beat your best game. Or you can try to beat your old company yourself.</p>
<h2>v0.50 - Body Trim Update</h2>
<p>Add chrome trims to your newest cars and merge wheel houses with the main body while you take the 4th body generation all the way to 1970.</p>
<h2>v0.60 - Media Update</h2>
<p>With all the major elements in place this update will finally remove all the place holder graphics and replace them with much better looking, final elements, created for the most part with Blender.</p>
<p>Bigger screen resolutions, new backdrops, sounds, music and a limited amount of animations will give the game a much more refined look.</p>
<h2>v0.70 - 80s Update</h2>
<p>The car as a box. In the big times of the angular designs, body generation 5 will take you through the 70s and 80s, adding lots more of technical gagdets to the cars.</p>
<h2>v0.80 - Beta Update</h2>
<p>A headlight designer will allow you to make your cars even more individual for the final decades of the game taking you to 2020 with the 6th body generation.</p>
<p>With the arrival of v0.80 all major features will be integrated and the game status will change from alpha to beta. At this point the Beta package perk will yield keys to these supporters.</p>
<h2>v0.90 - Home Stretch Update</h2>
<p>The final ideas and player wishes that have come up during beta testing will be implemented. Further updates will concentrate on fixing final bugs while the game officially moves from beta versions to release candidates.</p>
<h2>v1.00 - Release Update</h2>
<p>This is the release version that will be delivered in boxes to those that ordered the Boxed Version or higher perks including it. Only minor updates and fixes are expected at this point.</p>
<h2>The Add-On</h2>
<p>If it is financially viable (e.g. because the Add-On-Stretch-Goal has been met) the development will continue on an Add-On that will let you drive your cars in races or just for fun. It will also expand the game time into the future and add some futuristic technologies to the game.</p>
<p>If it gets made it will be free to all who supported this project with € 10 or more and to all who preordered during the alpha phase.</p>

It's inspired by classic simulations like Detroit and Motor City. A chain of thoughts on how to grow from these classics has lead to a unique approach on how to build your cars ingame:
A semi-free body editor and components derived from tech-levels with improvable properties truly make your cars your cars.
In the game you can...
...see how your cars hold up against the competition in a simulated market that is based on what the cars in it can actually do.
...let your cars compete in simulated races and see how well they hold up to the competition in this field.
...sell cars on all 6 continents and become the greatest car manufacturer of all times in a game that will ultimately span the entire history of the automobile from 1900 all the way to 2020 (the current alpha version ends in 1930, the next major update v0.30 will end in 1950) and possibly beyond (an add-on is under consideration).

<h4><b>The Reasons, the Goals and How the Funds
are Utilized.</b></h4>
<p>I had the original Idea for this campaign while working on a
game art package that I hoped I could release, which would bring in the
occasional donation that would lead to saving enough for a new computer. Over the following weeks I had bigger and
better ideas on how to go about procuring those funds and it became more and
more about releasing an enormous art pack that was crowd-funded, crowd-directed
and (until it was finished) crowd exclusive. </p>
<p>I want to reward people with more than just
game art that <b>I </b>needed or wanted to create. I want them to tell me what they
need in that art pack and to receive more than just an ""I'll take that
into consideration."" You fund the art, you get to tell me what to create
using simple rewards that go up in price as they get claimed. Whether you want
more character customization or a mansion with hidden passages, you can have
it. All you need to do is contribute and pick your perk. Then, when I ask you
what you want, tell me. Don't hold back. Challenge me, because this is also a

<p>Some ever-so-handy bullet points follow below for more concise
information about this campaign <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">and the art. Then, a little about me.</span></p>
<h4><b>This is what funders with a contribution of
$5 or more will receive:</b></h4>
<ul>
<li>The
     timed-exclusive, restriction-less rights to use all the art that gets
     created through this campaign within your own game development projects.
     To be released as it is created, exclusively to funders until all rewards
     are fulfilled at which point it is released to
     the public under the public domain(CCO License).</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the perks to see what custom art is up for grabs. <b>The earlier the bird, the lower the required contribution will
be.</b> When all of the limited quantities of a perk are chosen, the perk
will be reintroduced with a higher required contribution being necessary to
choose it. The amount will not exceed what a fair price for such a
commission <i>would</i> be and they definitely begin very cheap.</p>
<h4><b>The funds from this campaign are used as
such:</b></h4>
<ul>
<li>The funds, up to
     the goal amount, will be used for me to get a new computer and set aside
     enough to replace the components my pen tablet should something break. I
     currently have a laptop that was gifted to me a few years ago. It was
     nothing special then, and now it is really showing it's age and price tag.
     It slows down consistently while using the programs required to create the
     art and this makes everything I do take more time. It was enough to get me
     into digital art with a cheap pen tablet and I would like to build a new
     computer that will <i>keep</i> me in digital art for the next
     few years. Nothing too fancy, but strong enough to not need replacing over
     the next few years, which is easily doable as I will build it myself with
     a friend that has done it multiple times.</li>
<li>I have some
     awesome stretch goals in mind that could very well be their own
     crowdfunding campaigns. Hopefully, I will get to present them here.</li>
</ul>
<h4><b>Why flexible funding? What if the goal
is <i>not </i>reached?</b></h4>
<ul>
<li>I chose flexible
     funding so that even if only one person contributed just enough for one
     creation, I would be able to honor that contribution the way I intended to
     from the beginning. By rewarding them.</li>
<li>If the goal
     is <b>not</b> reached, nothing changes. I simply don't get the
     new computer until I can save up the difference, which may take forever
     but one step closer is better than standing still. However the closer the campaign gets to the goal, the more art that will be created and released. If the current batch of 40 bundle rewards all get picked up, there will be over 200 assets in the package. The individual parts of characters and tiles of tile sets are not counted separately. A full tile set is <b>one </b>asset as is a character or an object.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About The Art</h2>
<p>The game art style has been chosen for both maximum ease-of-use
and ability to customize. As well as for my love of the projection in general. It allows 4, 8 or even full 360 degree movement, action and exploration which provides a bunch of game developing opportunities. Also because I haven't seen a pack in a similar style that contains more than the basics while plenty of strictly side-view art is out there.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Vector
     Origins - </b>Any size can be derived from just the one original
     working file when using vectors. It is also much easier to make small
     edits such as recolors if you so desire.</li>
<li>
<b>Consistent Style
     Across All Assets - </b>No more struggles to find free art that
     looks like it was made by artists with the same vision. Whether the game
     you make is about cavemen, aliens or both, you can rest easy knowing the
     game will have a consistent appearance. The rules by which the art is
     created will also be made available so that any one can make meaningful
     additions to the set. Also, while pixel art is great it is uncommon to
     find top down art that <i>isn't </i>pixel art, let alone a set
     that you helped create and expand.</li>
<li>
<b>Parts Based
     Animation - </b>Rig your character up like puppets or use
     pre-animated sprite sheets. Each has their pros and cons which is why
     I will provide the components of both. This also allows the mixing and
     matching of pieces from different characters. Even facial features can be
     swapped depending on what the developer or even player wants since
     implementing a character creator for your game or randomly generating
     enemies with slightly different appearances will be a breeze. An army of
     clones no more!</li>
<li>
<b>Interchangeable - </b>For
     example: The walls and the corner pillars of the walls are
     interchangeable. The red walls can be matched to the grey, square pillars
     and so on. This means that for each wall set that gets created, the new
     pillars can be mixed with the old walls and the old pillars can be mixed
     with the new walls. The best part is that I will create a new pillar set
     with each wall set that gets directed by a contributor, and vice versa.
     Ground sets can also be mixed thanks to transparency meaning no
     foreseeable “transition tiles” will be necessary.</li>
<li>
<b>Genre
     Independent - </b>Whether you wish to create a side-scrolling beat'em
     up, an RPG, an endless runner or a shooter; You can do so with this art.</li>
</ul>
<h4><b>How will the art be distributed? </b></h4><p>The art will be sent through emails as a link to download.  After the campaign and for as long as it takes to finish perk fulfillment, you will receive a weekly email that contains 2 links. One to download only any new art for that week and another to download the entire asset pack, including those newest items.</p><h4><b>How will the ""directing"" work? </b></h4><p>The directing will work through email, Skype, Facebook or any other suggested means of communication through one, or a combination of three following methods. You can fill out a detailed form that I have created, send me sketches or pictures that show what you mean and/or you can simply type out all you want. I recommend using all 3 as it will surely allow me better comprehension of what it is you have in mind. I will not recreate copyrighted characters, etc. in this campaign art's style as the point is to expand an art package that you can use within any game development project. That art would not be eligible for such distribution.</p><h4><b>What is in the pack so far?</b></h4>

</ul></div>","(Update 1 contains updated information on this campaigns perks!)About The Campaign
The Reasons, the Goals and How the Funds
are Utilized.
I had the original Idea for this campaign while working on a
game art package that I hoped I could release, which would bring in the
occasional donation that would lead to saving enough for a new computer. Over the following weeks I had bigger and
better ideas on how to go about procuring those funds and it became more and
more about releasing an enormous art pack that was crowd-funded, crowd-directed
and (until it was finished) crowd exclusive. 
I want to reward people with more than just
game art that I needed or wanted to create. I want them to tell me what they
need in that art pack and to receive more than just an ""I'll take that
into consideration."" You fund the art, you get to tell me what to create
using simple rewards that go up in price as they get claimed. Whether you want
more character customization or a mansion with hidden passages, you can have
it. All you need to do is contribute and pick your perk. Then, when I ask you
what you want, tell me. Don't hold back. Challenge me, because this is also a
means by which I aim to improve my capabilities. When all of the perks are
fulfilled I want an urge to recreate the earliest works to present itself. When
all is said and done, I want to think ""I can do that much better than
before"".
Some ever-so-handy bullet points follow below for more concise
information about this campaign and the art. Then, a little about me.
This is what funders with a contribution of
$5 or more will receive:

The
     timed-exclusive, restriction-less rights to use all the art that gets
     created through this campaign within your own game development projects.
     To be released as it is created, exclusively to funders until all rewards
     are fulfilled at which point it is released to
     the public under the public domain(CCO License).

Check out the perks to see what custom art is up for grabs. The earlier the bird, the lower the required contribution will
be. When all of the limited quantities of a perk are chosen, the perk
will be reintroduced with a higher required contribution being necessary to
choose it. The amount will not exceed what a fair price for such a
commission would be and they definitely begin very cheap.
The funds from this campaign are used as
such:

I have some
     awesome stretch goals in mind that could very well be their own
     crowdfunding campaigns. Hopefully, I will get to present them here.

Why flexible funding? What if the goal
is not reached?

I chose flexible
     funding so that even if only one person contributed just enough for one
     creation, I would be able to honor that contribution the way I intended to
     from the beginning. By rewarding them.
If the goal
     is not reached, nothing changes. I simply don't get the

<p>Okay. Well. That was nuts. 3.5x the goal in 24 hours. Many, many thanks for your generosity.

The outpouring of gratitude to Danny says it all.<br/></p>
<p>Okay, so that's that. What's next?<br/></p>
<p>The new goal is <b>$2,500</b> for the purpose of throwing a very excellent party (food, kegs, commemorative t-shirts?!) for the extended Field Gulls Writer's Guild. Show your support for the guys who make sure there is something new to read almost every time you load the site.<br/></p>

<h3>What?</h3> <p>Yeah, man. We should send this dude to a Seahawks game. Basically Danny Kelly has provided Seahawks fans with the following things<br/></p> <ul>
<li>Deeper understanding of the game, and the type of football Seattle plays<br/>
</li> <li>Genuinely the best online sports community in existence</li>
<li>If you like to write about the Seahawks, a platform on which to do so<br/>

My parents sent me to a psychologist to discuss the things that were happening to me.  I told him the truth--that I could hear voices, not just in the dreams, but even while I was awake.  They'd follow me walking down the hallways alone or going to school.  Everywhere I was I felt like I was being watched.  The psychologist first thought that I was schizophrenic, but without the family history, he said that I did not fit the profile--the facts just didn't add up.  Maybe I was schizophrenic.  Maybe I was crazy.  Even so, after all this time, what if it is real?  Are the shadows really following me?  Are the voices I hear ghosts, or spirits, or something?  Are they real?  Is SHE real?  Only recently I have started to see more than shadows. . . I saw her--a girl in the dark.  I didn't see her clearly at first, but later on I could see her more fully.  I could see the details on her face.  I could hear her voice clearly now.  I was not mistaken, it was ALWAYS her.  I think I can almost feel her presence.  My god!  Am I going crazy!?. . . or is this real?  And if so, who is SHE--what is SHE, and what the hell does SHE want with me!?</i></p><p></p><h3>Demo Scenes</h3><p>*These scenes have been stripped to 'terrible' graphics mode for web player versatility.</p><p>All scenes require the Unity Web Player plugin.  <a href=""https://unity3d.com/webplayer"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Download here</a></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/608202/files/20140527172836-TheCity.jpg?1401236916"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b><i><a href=""https://googledrive.com/host/0B67_rWK4SpwZMjkzaUkzbUFTQ1U/City.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://googledrive.com/host/0B67_rWK4SpwZMjkzaUkzbUFTQ1U/City.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Click to test</a></i></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/608206/files/20140527173444-TheAsylum.jpg?1401237284"" src="""" style=""""/></p><a href=""https://googledrive.com/host/0B67_rWK4SpwZM2VFQ1l1RWxrWlU/Small%20Asylum.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://googledrive.com/host/0B67_rWK4SpwZM2VFQ1l1RWxrWlU/Small%20Asylum.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b><i>Click to test</i></b></a><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Game Mechanics</h3><p></p><p>The object of the game is to survive and escape from your past.  There are many puzzles you will encounter, each with a different spirit that will tell you their story and either help you or kill you.  You will then solve these puzzles to escape and move onto another.  You will run into many different creatures throughout the adventure whilst you are being guided by the voice of a past life.  You will use everything you can possibly find to help you throughout your journey.  You will find different electronic devices (i.e. flashlights, infrared cameras, cell phones, etc.) to guide you through the atmospheric environment.

My parents sent me to a psychologist to discuss the things that were happening to me.  I told him the truth--that I could hear voices, not just in the dreams, but even while I was awake.  They'd follow me walking down the hallways alone or going to school.  Everywhere I was I felt like I was being watched.  The psychologist first thought that I was schizophrenic, but without the family history, he said that I did not fit the profile--the facts just didn't add up.  Maybe I was schizophrenic.  Maybe I was crazy.  Even so, after all this time, what if it is real?  Are the shadows really following me?  Are the voices I hear ghosts, or spirits, or something?  Are they real?  Is SHE real?  Only recently I have started to see more than shadows. . . I saw her--a girl in the dark.  I didn't see her clearly at first, but later on I could see her more fully.  I could see the details on her face.  I could hear her voice clearly now.  I was not mistaken, it was ALWAYS her.  I think I can almost feel her presence.  My god!  Am I going crazy!?. . . or is this real?  And if so, who is SHE--what is SHE, and what the hell does SHE want with me!?Demo Scenes*These scenes have been stripped to 'terrible' graphics mode for web player versatility.All scenes require the Unity Web Player plugin.  Download hereClick to testClick to testGame MechanicsThe object of the game is to survive and escape from your past.  There are many puzzles you will encounter, each with a different spirit that will tell you their story and either help you or kill you.  You will then solve these puzzles to escape and move onto another.  You will run into many different creatures throughout the adventure whilst you are being guided by the voice of a past life.  You will use everything you can possibly find to help you throughout your journey.  You will find different electronic devices (i.e. flashlights, infrared cameras, cell phones, etc.) to guide you through the atmospheric environment. You will be chased by spirits, causing you damage, and if you cannot escape you will surely perish.Adaption/Game AlterationThis is something that no game has ever done before to this extent!  The game will deliver an intensely frightening experience by exposing the player to their deepest fears.  The game will discover those fears and then alter itself to play with the fears of the player.  For example, if the player has a fear of darkness and loneliness, the game will discover this by observing the players actions, their movements, the paths and routes they take, their strategies, or other things that are much more subtle.  Once the system has gathered information accordingly, it will begin to alter the game to present the player with their deepest fears.  When the game starts, the system will begin by tracking the players movements and places visited.  It will then start testing between different fears and seeing the players reactions towards them, altering itself to maximize the fear factor.AlterationsThe game maps will consist of many rooms and parts of which can be swapped for one another.  The game will swap the rooms to whatever the game believes the player would suffer from the most.  These parts will contain many interactive and non-interactive events that the player will experience if their 'fear meter' runs too high (i.e. loneliness, darkness, ghosts, spiders, ambiance, color).  The game will also test for different ambiances to see which one will scare you the most and apply it throughout!We have calculated that there is over 607,019,550 alterations per interior that the player can adapt to!Here is an example of the interior alterations;Current StateRight now, the team under 'The Sounds of Silence' is working on expanding the world and story, layering detail, and increasing the game’s fear factor. We are working diligently and rapidly to prepare the BETA for release to backers.SuspenseTaking inspiration from our favorite game series, Silent Hill, 'The Sound of Silence' builds fear mainly with atmospheric effects and game mechanics.  Players sense the pursuit with the full power of the mechanics, creating dramatic shadows and lighting, and subtle visual cues. Why Back Us?Immersion is the most important thing in telling a great story, which means that the game will have to be detailed and scary.   It is very important that we design and build a game that our fans want.  This requires a lot of will and most importantly, time.  This, of course, requires a lot of money.  Up to this point, our team has been working part-time.  As we are able to get money to fund this project we will be able to focus more on the game full time with much more detail.  The money will also help us reach Sony, Steam, and many other publishers.  The game will look and feel beautiful with only the best of all designs picked with constant, thorough testing in the development processes.  We will build the game around the ideas that players have provided from the builds we send out. This game showcases things NEVER seen in games before.  This could easily change games forever and change the meaning of a true horror game.Risks and ChallengesMaking a game takes a lot of time, which in turn costs money.  If we don't have enough funding the time may become an issue, but we will try to overcome these issues.",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><b>Game concepts</b></h3>
<p>We are participating in a sports fieldlab setting and are developing all sorts of game concepts in collaboration with players, sports teachers and sports innovation organisations in the Netherlands. We started out with one-on-one games, pattern-play and YOU.FO golf. When more people got to test YOU.FO the idea for inflatable ring goals was born, and <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">they have already proven to be a great, fun addition to the game. </span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Another idea, yet to be tested, has been developed by an Industrial Design student; he applied his technical skills to develop a YOU.FO game including sensors telling you, through buzzing the stick(!), wether you are in the right zone to score. As you can tell we really embrace creativity and innovation and we invite everyone to join us!<br/></span></p>

YOU.FO (patent pending) is an
innovative sportsconcept, based on throwing and catching an aerodynamic ring
with specially designed sticks over distances of 10 to 30 metres. This requires
concentration, strength, flexibility and cooperation. The basic skills are easy
to learn but YOU.FO players continue to be challenged to improve their skills, and

Development of YOU.FO
Founder of YOU.FO, Bas Ruyssenaars, was on
summer vacation in 2010 when he recalled a game he had invented and played when
he was young. Bas and his son started improvising on the beach and the idea for
YOU.FO was born. Once back home Bas set up a team of industrial
designers, specialists in aerodynamics, sport innovation professionals and
trainee sports teachers. Now, after two years of concept development and fine-tuning, YOU.FO is market ready.
A YOU.FO set contains two sticks made of aluminum frames, and a plastic, double-layered, aerodynamic ring. The weight of a stick is 600 gram and the weight of a ring is 160 gram.  As we value sustainable, environment friendly production processes, a lot of thought has gone into the production materials: recycling of all YOU.FO plastic components is guaranteed through the Return2Sender (R2S) recycle programme. 




                        



Game concepts
We are participating in a sports fieldlab setting and are developing all sorts of game concepts in collaboration with players, sports teachers and sports innovation organisations in the Netherlands. We started out with one-on-one games, pattern-play and YOU.FO golf. When more people got to test YOU.FO the idea for inflatable ring goals was born, and they have already proven to be a great, fun addition to the game. 
Another idea, yet to be tested, has been developed by an Industrial Design student; he applied his technical skills to develop a YOU.FO game including sensors telling you, through buzzing the stick(!), wether you are in the right zone to score. As you can tell we really embrace creativity and innovation and we invite everyone to join us!


Our achievements up to now
YOU.FO has benefitted
from design collaboration with a wide range of partners and is proud to have
secured the support of the Netherlands Olympic Committee. YOU.FO won the 2012
European-wide award of ProFit Innovation Competition for the FieldLab
Eindhoven. The ProFit jury describes YOU.FO as “highly innovative, with the right mix between power and balance.” YOU.FO has been selected as finalist for both the Brand New Award 2013 at ISPO - the world’s largest sports trade fair- and for the National Sports Innovation Award 2013, in the Netherlands.


Why we need YOU? 

We are extremely happy to receive this recognition and praise for YOU.FO, in which we have invested more than 20.000 hours of research, design, training and -off course- playing. But we're not quite there yet. We need YOU: curious, sporty enthusiasts who want to join the creation of a new global sports game. We need your contribution to:
Produce the first series of sticks, rings and carrying bags - You can play YOU.FO by the end of this year and share your enthusiasm in your neigbourhood.

Develop more game concepts - Your contribution would be used to cover amongst others: the costs of YOU.FO development for children (6-12); costs for (testing) the materials and game attributes (like the inflatable ring goals); costs of testing the target groups' reaction to different game concepts; and the costs of human kinetics, researching the physical abilities stimulated by playing YOU.FO.


We are happy with any contribution you can make and from 79€ (or 99$), including shipping costs, we ensure you get your own exclusive YOU.FO set send to your home directly before it hits the stores! One YOU.FO set contains: two throwing sticks, one aerodynamic ring, one carrying bag, and only for indiegogo funders an extra ring! 



Estimated production schedule 
August 1st - production batch first 40 test sets (as shown in videoclip);
November 1st - Test results / Final approval for first production order; 
December 1st - Estimated time of arrival first production shipment. 
We expect to deliver your YOU.FO set at your door before the end of December (early birds). Before it gets to the stores!

Thank you so much for joining the creation of a new global sports game !

The way you build your base is totally up to you. You can play very offensive and build an army so you can raid other people bases , or you can play more defensive and build defense buildings to defend yourself from other player raids. <br/><br/>At the very beginning of the game player will be able to chose from few different landscapes where he wants to start his base. After you choose you landscape , your journey begins!<br/><br/>Now as in any strategy game you need some resources to construct a building. In Modern Tank the main resource for building is money. You get certain amount of money at the very beginning of the game , and you can generate more money by constructing so called ""Money buildings"". </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">There's no point in having a base if you can't defend it. To increase your total defense you will have to build so called ""Defense buildings"". Your army will increase your defense aswell but constructing Defense buildings will significantly increase your total defense.<br/><br/>With your base and economy in order , you will need to make your army. After creating your army , you will want to boost it so it can win in any battle you go into. To boost your army stats you can build so called ""Boost buildings"".</span></p><p>Now when you have everything set up you would probably want to do something with your army. Well this is where the game gets more interesting. In the game there are alot of missions that needs to be done. Missions can give you wide variety of items,units , experience points and of course money. Every missions has few objectives. For example , some missions will require you to construct certain building , then upgrade the same building few times , and other missions would send you to another side of the world to eliminate your enemies and destroy their headquarters!</p><p></p><p></p><p>Every player will have his own profile , where he can check his statistic, like how much money he generates currently or what is his total attack/defense and what's his current missions status. You will also be able to search for other players , and peek into their base to see what they are building and how their base looks like.</p><p>Speaking about game controls , they are fairly simple -  You will be able to move your camera , zoom in/out , rotate the camera and peek into every street in the game and check out any building in your base from every angle. </p><p>Currently we have more then 70 structures implemented in the game for players to buy.

<p></p><p></p></div>","hi guys .. after 2 weeks in to this campaign my game was removed from the ""gaming' section of the site .and this is the answer to it ..from indiegogo support .""Hi Eran,This best thing for you to do is to share the campaign with your friends and family. The key to a successful campaign is the ability to raise 30% of your goal through your own social network. Once you do this, you will be visible in the gaming section- the browse sections are composed of brand new campaigns as well as campaigns that have a high amount of activity.""i have done all in my knowledge to promote my game ,if i was able to get founded with family and friends .i wont be here .the all idea of this site is ""crowd founding"",and for backers to view and search the site gaming section and found the games they like .and not to beg family and friends for funds. yours Eran Modern Tank is a new strategy game in development by E.N Games.We started developing Modern Tank about a year ago to with the goal to create one of the best free 3D multiplayer strategy games.One of the main features in our game is player base. The game features wide variety of buildings for players to buy and place the way they like. Every building has it's own stats and will impact the player's gameplay in some way (beside decor buildings). Besides your base , you will have to rise an army , an army strong enough to defend yourself from other player raids but also to raid other bases and complete missions.Game features alot of missions spread across the world of Modern Tank. Missions will have different objectives , from building certain structures to going across the world to complete some objectives. There's a video of how the base worksMind that alot of material used in the video is not final since we're in the middle of the development process.And of course the sound track in the game-The game goal is to build your own base and army. The way you build your base is totally up to you. You can play very offensive and build an army so you can raid other people bases , or you can play more defensive and build defense buildings to defend yourself from other player raids. At the very beginning of the game player will be able to chose from few different landscapes where he wants to start his base. After you choose you landscape , your journey begins!Now as in any strategy game you need some resources to construct a building. In Modern Tank the main resource for building is money. You get certain amount of money at the very beginning of the game , and you can generate more money by constructing so called ""Money buildings"". There's no point in having a base if you can't defend it. To increase your total defense you will have to build so called ""Defense buildings"". Your army will increase your defense aswell but constructing Defense buildings will significantly increase your total defense.With your base and economy in order , you will need to make your army. After creating your army , you will want to boost it so it can win in any battle you go into. To boost your army stats you can build so called ""Boost buildings"".Now when you have everything set up you would probably want to do something with your army. Well this is where the game gets more interesting. In the game there are alot of missions that needs to be done. Missions can give you wide variety of items,units , experience points and of course money. Every missions has few objectives. For example , some missions will require you to construct certain building , then upgrade the same building few times , and other missions would send you to another side of the world to eliminate your enemies and destroy their headquarters!Every player will have his own profile , where he can check his statistic, like how much money he generates currently or what is his total attack/defense and what's his current missions status. You will also be able to search for other players , and peek into their base to see what they are building and how their base looks like.Speaking about game controls , they are fairly simple -  You will be able to move your camera , zoom in/out , rotate the camera and peek into every street in the game and check out any building in your base from every angle. Currently we have more then 70 structures implemented in the game for players to buy. Structures are divided in structure groups so you have Money buildings,Defense buildings,Boost buildings,Special buildings and Decor buildings. Once you bought and placed your building you will be able to upgrade that building several times. With each upgrade the stats of the building will rise.Players will be experiencing realistic weather system which includes day and night shifts , rain and snow and even some snow/sand storms depending where your base is.                              Here are some of the 3D models used in our game.Boost structures        in the game players have more then 200 units to buy.Here are just some of 3d unit modes.            Through out the game , players will get alot of missions to complete. You could get a missions that will require you to construct a certain building , and then upgrade that same building few times. Or they can send you across the world to eliminate certain targets. First you need to locate them and they can be scattered across the world then eliminate them. Here's a preview of one of the missions with certain objectives. Taping once on the building reveals what actions you can take against that building , and clicking it twice would execute that.Example of a mission war zone (work in progress) :     2$ Reward - As the reward label says , you get your name or nickname in ""The Credits"" under ""Special thanks"" section of our forum webpage.(and a hand shake).http://www.moderntank.ca/index.php?threads/indiegogo-special-thanks.7045/5$ Reward - If you pledge 5$ or more you will get the previous reward plus your name or nickname under ""Special thanks"" section of the game credits.10$ Reward - If you pledge 10$ or more you will get all previous rewards plus 50 E.N tokens. You can use these tokens to speed up certain processes in the game , regenerate stamina and energy quickly and buy some exclusive units or structures.20$ Reward - If you pledge 20$ or more you will get all previous rewards plus an indestructible tank unit. Indestructible means that this unit can't be looted or destroyed in battle or in any mission. It will also have an unique model with unique textures available only for indiegogo backers.50$ Reward - If you pledge 50$ or more you will get all previous rewards plus a special structure. This structure will boost your energy regeneration by 5%. The structure itself will also have an unique model and textures that will only be available to indiegogo backers.Creator of Modern Tank - Eran segalI live in Toronto, Canada and i have a wife and 2 girls(not planing for more)!

I am a complete nerd, a gamer, and a book junkie. I am rather a long winded
individual, though I believe the politically correct term is a Writer or Author.
Throw in some Attention Deficit Disorder, and you have…Oh hey look, a kitty!</p>
<p>So anyway, back in the day of avid gaming, I played
everything. I seriously was that one person that killed you twenty times. Yep. You
hated me. When I lost my ability to play for a long while, it didn’t take my
love of gaming away; it just pushed it into another direction.  Making games, not just any kind of games, but
games made from books. Seriously, do you know how many amazing books would make
incredible games? </p>
<p>So I put my idea into the works, and took it to a
trusted friend and avid gamer from work and showed him. His exact words were:
“This has never been done!”. From that statement and the look on his face, I
knew I had something. I took it to a few other hardcore gamer friends I also
worked with, and they were like, “OH MY GOD, THIS <i>has to</i> HAPPEN!!!”. They took the idea to their gamer friends, who
said the same thing. Then, I took it to Facebook and got so much interest, I
knew it had to happen. So <i>Buddy Boy
Technologies</i> (BBT), was created.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1429439/files/20150430095022-3.jpg?1430412622"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Come Hell or high water, I am going to make this
happen… The first ever adult romance, sexual, action packed, literary, and
educational video game. Let’s hear you say that three times fast! </p>
<p>And in order to make this reality, I’m going to need
an amazing team behind me. The first member of that team is Jules Warner, my
partner in crime! A mutual friend introduced me to my future partner. He has
the intelligence of <i>Stephen Hawking</i>, <i>Bill Gates</i>, <i>Steve Jobs</i>, and the education to back it up. He has degrees in
Electrical and Electronic Engineering, and he is an asset to BBT. I am lucky
enough to call him my friend and partner, he has chosen an amazing and creative team to follow our lead.</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p><p>Jules and I have a

<p><i><b>Pandora's Soldiers Synopsis </b></i></p><p><i><b>USMC
Major James Kennedy and Major Roger Dawson, along with
their Lieutenant Colonel Carter Banks and Gunnery Sergeant Riley Mason are on a
mission to find Samantha and Sophia, they vanished without a trace. Only to
find that their Investigation leads back to their dark past of being Elite
members of the Force Recon Company and as they soon discover, the team is being

interactive programming, you will not only enjoy the book, you will be able to
make, design, play, and conquer your own alternate journey and destination
ending. You will experience hands on feelings with remote controlled romance,
sex, drama, action, thriller, suspense, murder, and humor.</p>
<p>On the lower levels,
you follow the book until completed. You are assigned a character movie, then
given instructions to play out through the chapters. The higher the levels, the
more customizable the game. For example, when a sex scene comes along in the
book, on the lower levels you just watch the sexual interaction, which still
actually incredibly hot. However, on the higher levels, you will be able to
control the sex scenes, and the higher the level you get to, the hotter the
sex. The sex levels include basic scenes, all the way to BDSM. When you create
your characters, they are completely tailored for you, including body parts.</p>
<p>But the higher levels
have even more going for them then just sexual encounters. You will be able to
create your own characters and even your own avatar, if you wish. If you would
like to choose to play the book in a zombie, witch, or wizard version, again,
you can on higher levels. There is never an end to this game! </p>
<p>As you’ll recall, I
mentioned the game also having an educational aspect. This is where that
portion will come into play. You will have game checkpoints like any other
game, where your character will have to solve puzzles and figure out clues.
Let’s say your character gets to a checkpoint and in order to move on, you have
to answer a trivia question or even travel to a point of interest, so you will
learn about it. Example questions would be: “What year did the Library of Alexandria burn down … or …
what year was the Declaration of
Independence signed?” And example travel sites might be the Great Wall of China or Liberty Hall.  The higher the levels, the harder the game
gets. </p><p>Here's some concept art.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1429871/files/20150430115740-CONCEPT_ART.jpg?1430420260"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p>I have many incredible games lined up, so let's get down to business!</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p style=""font-style: italic;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1429561/files/20150430102023-v-for-vendetta2.jpg?1430414423"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>It takes more than

<p>My name is Volodymyr Dotsenko. I'm independent game developer from Ukraine, or more precisely want to earn the honor to be called 'independent game developer' by others. For that I'm developing my first game project, having more then six years of experience working in game industry, so I'm pretty confident in things I'm doing and can complete the task. All I need is your valuable support.</p>
<h3>Inverto history</h3>
<p>Game concept #1 was born in 2008 just after playing Portal game by Valve. But back then it was more of a Portal clone, and since I didn't have any programming experience, so idea went in hybernation.</p>
<p><img alt=""early game concept"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://inverto.gravityboxstudio.net/images/EarlyConceptScreen.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Early game concept (2011)""/></p>
<p><strong>Early game concept</strong></p>
<p>In three years when I was getting familiar with Unity, while making architectural presentations on this fantastic engine, idea came back to life as a little phisics experiment. That's when actual Inverto birth have happened.</p>
<p><img alt=""First playable version"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://inverto.gravityboxstudio.net/images/GravitronScreen.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>First playable Version</strong></p>
<p>Since then working on this idea as a part-time hobby-job untill end of last year, when I've decided that it's time to be serious about it. So I've left my job behind and till now I'm working fulltime on Inverto.</p>
<p><img alt=""Inverto in HD quality"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://sphotos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/p480x480/547791_180155298804043_2118479357_n.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""HD version""/></p>
<p><strong>Inverto HD version (Unity DirectX 11 contest)</strong></p>
<p>HD version was made for Unity DirectX 11 competition, and contained two playable levels. It can be downloaded from IndieDB : <a href=""http://www.indiedb.com/games/gravitron/downloads"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.indiedb.com/games/gravitron/downloads</a> </p>
<p>Note: If stretch goal(see above) will be reached, Inverto might get HD version graphics quality.</p>
<h2>
<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://inverto.gravityboxstudio.net/images/icon.ico"" src="""" style=""""/> <span style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">Why IndieGoGo?</span>
</h2>
<p>Working on a game is pure joy, but paying your living is sometimes expensive. I work fulltime on Inverto more then half a year, and my savings are quickly depleting, plus some software licenses and publishing do require a significant financing. But biggest problem is time, working on every single aspect of a game project takes a lot of learning, trials and errors, it takes a lot of time and often comes out not to be so proffesional as expected. That's why I need additional help, hire some specialists (and I think they don't need to work for free). Plus perks should be made and shipped to all of you. I'm expecting to collect lowest money amount possible, but really I do want Inverto to become HD.</p>

<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://inverto.gravityboxstudio.net/images/icon.ico"" src="""" style=""""/><span style=""font-size: 1.5em;""> When game will be ready?</span>
</h2>
<p>I'm aiming the end of 2013, but it's always a good point to add extra time just in case. So beginning of 2014 is more realistic, though extra money will speed up development.</p>
<h2>What platforms will game support?</h2>
<p>Primary platform is Windows. But Linux(Ubuntu) system is in my plans. Mac support is different, I'll have to buy Mac computer to seriously support this platform (that is also why I need money), wish I could find a developer to help me out with this problem.</p>

 Welcome

Hello and welcome to ""Inverto"" crowd-funding campaign page. ""Inverto"" is a first person shooter-puzzler with gravity manipulations, platformer elements and parkour phylosophy in mind. If you have not seen a traler video I strongly recommend doing so to get the idea of a gameplay. Or if you want more solid experience try Inverto Alpha in your browser WebPlayer or Download it from IndieDB.
Etalyx(GamersDissent) is previewing my alpha version on Youtube! (game was called Gravitron before)
 

 About Inverto


Main feature of Inverto is of course gravity manipulations. All levels are created around concept of changing gravity to get to the other side, some levels even can be changed with different gravity directions. Gyroscopic switches, force fields, teleports, dangerous laser traps, moving platforms, evil turrets droids, everything good sci-fi game needs, except portal gun and aliens.

If you remember ""Prey""(2006), game by Human Head Studios and 3D Realms, you might find similarity, I've enjoyed this game, but gravity manipulations there were more like spare feature, never discovering it's true potential. Inverto is here to fulfill the mission, besides there are not many fps gravity games on a market.

 Stretch Goals

It's a flexible funding campaign, so if campaign fails game will be only 9 levels long.
$4000 - game will get 7 extra levels, 16 instead of 9.
$7000 - game gets 24 levels in total and AI(vicious droids and bosses).

</h3> <p>Welcome to the indiegogo page for The Asylum, home of Sykotic Gaming! I am a 31-year-old Army veteran who dreams of being able to support his family by becoming a partnered broadcaster on Twitch.<br/></p> <ul> <li>I served in the Army from 2004-2015, and I was medically discharged at 80% disability. I'm a husband to an amazing woman, and a father to 6 absolutely incredible children.<br/>
</li> <li>This campaign is designed to cover the costs of hiring a graphic designer to do my complete design/branding for The Asylum, who would then advertise the channel itself. It will also help finish covering equipment costs for items I need to do a solid, professional, fun stream.<br/>
</li> <li>Achieving this goal would literally launch my stream far above others that are trying to start up, and get me on a solid path to partnership within a month or two, instead of over several years. You would enable me to be able to finally work from home, doing something I genuinely love and am passionate about, and be able to spend more time with my wife and kids, which is something I've been sorely missing for a long time, between Army life and working 50+ hours a week after getting out.<br/>
</li> </ul> <br/> </div> <div> <h3>So here's the low-down, y'all<br/>
</h3> <p>Here's how it's going to break down.<br/></p> <ul> <li>So, the guy who has offered to do my complete branding and advertising is asking $900(which is actually pretty low, considering). This would include all my channel buttons, offline banner, profile picture and banner for all my social media, and all the artwork I would need on Twitch. Any remaining funds that go beyond that will go straight to the channel, in terms of program licenses and streaming equipment.<br/>
</li> <li>All of the perks on this campaign are unique to my Twitch channel. If you're not a gamer, but would still like to contribute, please, by all means, feel free to message me and we can figure out suitable replacement perks!<br/>
</li> <li>Even if we don't meet the goal, all funds donated to this cause will go exclusively towards all costs associated with the channel, i.e. advertising, graphic design, and streaming hardware. Every single cent donated will go towards that.<br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>What it would mean to me<br/>
</h3> <p>This right here, being able to make video games a living, is my dream. It's something I've been passionate about ever since I was a little kid. And the ability to not only do that, but build a thriving, supporting community, where people can take refuge from the world for a few hours, and talk, joke, and commiserate with like-minded people while watching a grown man do silly stuff on a video game, is actually extremely therapeutic. The Twitch community is amazing, and is doing nothing but growing. BUT, consider the following:<br/></p> <ul> <li>Doing this for a living would allow me to be a stay-at-home dad and husband, which is something I have NEVER been able to do. I've missed out on a lot of milestones with my kids, and important dates/anniversaries with my wife because of work and life happening. Doing this would allow me to stay at home and spend time with my family, something I have desperately needed for a long time.<br/>
</li>
<li>Not only would a channel like this provide a safe haven for people who 
don't exactly feel comfortable in other places, my channel would be the 
perfect platform to launch something from. If you need something to get 
to a lot of people quick, a popular Twitch streamer is the best way to 
do it in real-time. They can literally reach thousands of people within 
seconds.<br/>

Credit Switch is here to put the identity of consumers back in their hands and
give them full control of their identity. 
As a company, we’ve realized
that most credit protection companies can only let you know after your
information has been used of fraud, but with our app, you can prevent it before
it occurs if your identity is “turned off.”

  
 
Please help us in
spreading the word about Credit Switch so that we can help decrease the number
of identity fraud victims in the United States and possibly the world. This is
an issue that can cost hundreds to thousands of dollars and many years to fix.
This can prevent you from getting a house that you would like to move your
family to and getting the car you want. 
Our website is
identityhelper.org where you will find information on the latest fraud scams,
tips to help identify if you’ve been a victim of fraud, and can sign up for
Credit Switch. Please share our site with your friends on all of your social
media outlets. We thank you for helping us in the prevention of identity fraud
and bring awareness to this ever growing issue.",11.0,0,"1 Campaign

</ul><p></p><p>Thank you so much for all of your help!  I thank you!  Your characters thank you!  The Great Purple Pony thanks you!</p></div>","Purple Pony BadgesHi!  I'm Laurie -- you may know me as Knit Me A Pony.  I've been a pencil-and-paper gamer since 1992, and a LARPer almost as long.  Nearly every LARP I've been in uses some kind of system involving name tags and safety pins to indicate names, character types, status, and other relevant information. Sticky name tags and pins can damage costumes, handwriting can be messy, and con-style badges can look cheap or take away from immersion.Purple Pony Badges to the rescue!  I'd like to provide reasonably priced, attractive badges to the gaming community.  Not only are they great for long-term LARPs or to set yourself apart at big games, but they're an inexpensive way to give one-shot players a souvenir of the experience.I need a little help getting this off the ground -- that's where you come in!What I Need & What You GetThe first $1000 will get me the following:
Standard materials for samples: a selection of wood and acrylic so I can make sample badges and get the settings just right.
New materials for prototyping: samples of aluminum, glass, special acrylics and other materials so I can develop truly unique badges
Paint and other finishing
Samples of clips, magnets, and other attachments
Font licenses 
Stock icons & image licenses
Equipment to improve my photography of samples
If we manage to go above the limit, I'll also look into the following:
Business setup, including a mailbox, domain hosting, and LLC registration
Official licensing from gaming companies so I can use their logos and sigils directly
New Deluxe options, including borders & different badge shapes
Professional photography of my samples
Development of a site that will let you preview your badge design before submitting to me
Specialty paints like magnetic, chalkboard, and whiteboard
Electronics including LED indicators for status/hit points/health
Below are the reward levels.  Some of these prices will go up when I open for business; consider it an early-bird reward!  All reward levels include shipping within the continental US.   For Canada please add $4 to your contribution.  For the United Kingdom, please add $4 for individual badges or $10 for any Game Pack.NOTE: You do NOT have to know what you want on your badge before ordering.  Once the fundraiser is over, I will contact each person individually to select your materials and customize the content.

Add $25 to upgrade to painted wood or acrylic. (Game information and colors must match on all badges, but names, titles, & character info can be customized).

$250: Be My Prototype: Be the first to know what's going on, and get a single badge of all prototypes and new materials I test with for 1 year. I currently plan to try out all the following materials: cardboard, wood, acrylic, glass, aluminum. There are multiple types of wood and multiple types of acrylic.  I will work with you to choose colors & customize each badge individually.  Once the badge is made, I will take photographs of the badges and use them to promote the new styles in emails, on social media and in my shop.  Then the badges will be shipped to you for your own use before the new styles are for sale.

<p>Android Etch... Where to begin? Well, let me start with an introduction.</p>

<p></p>
<p>At first, I just did it for myself, but once I posted a <a href=""https://plus.google.com/113044695486274225252/posts/PB5gm57qfGX"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'>picture on Google+</a>, I knew there was both a market and a demand for this sort of thing. Being in college (at the time), I had too much on my plate to try and make this a reality, but I still never forgot about it.</p>
<p>Now, I've since graduated college, have a steady job, and am finally at a point where I can try and make some moves toward this goal of mine, but I can't do it without your help.</p>
<p>Android Etch is, to me, a labor of love, and something I desperately want to see come to fruition. I know how enthusiastic Android fans are, (I am one!) and I just want to be able to provide them with awesome, Android-branded stuff.</p>
<p>You, as a contributor, are the absolute lifeblood of this idea. Without your kindness and support, I'd either have to take out a small business loan (that I'd probably be paying off for a while), or save for a few years just to purchase the laser engraver I'm after.</p>
<p>Without you, essentially, my idea is just that. An idea.</p>
<p>If I don't reach my goal, I'm taking the money I received and depositing it directly into a high-yield savings account, where it'll accumulate interest faster than a standard savings account, and where I'll continue to put money until I've got the funds I need.</p>
<p>I won't touch it, I won't waste it, and I certainly won't spend it on anything unrelated to getting Android Etch started.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>I've said it before, and I'll say it again: I can't do this without you. Anything you can give puts me that much closer to realizing a dream of mine, and for that, I can't thank you enough.</p>

<p>BB Bastard has been passionate about airsoft for almost a decade. We believe the continued health and growth of our beloved sport relies on community, education and participation. This project has been a dream of our since we started airsoft. The quest to answer the questions surrounding what ACTUALLY happens during a BB's short lifespan inside the barrel.</p>
<p>Contribution to this project are about more than simply getting some schwag. There are tons of manufacturers and businesses that say they understand what it takes to make the inherently in-accurate airsoft platform more accurate, but very little practical testing to back it up.</p>
<p>Contributors to this project will be funding the the empowerment of the airsoft community to make buying decision with more accurate, reliant and unbiased information.</p>
<h3>Project Goals and Expenditures</h3>
<p>The project mission is to build a stable, reusable base test rig and then, using custom clear Pyrex barrels of various diameters, film the behavior of the BB in the barrel with high speed camera in the range of 5000-150000 frames per second.</p>
<p>The funding raise here for this project will be directed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>the purchase of 12 clear lab grade borosilicate barrels (approx $500)</li>
<li>the rental of an appropriate high speed digital camera (approx $2500) and stroboscope</li>
<li>the creation of perks ($500)</li>

<li>hi intensity lighting rental</li>
<li>open source documentary video and photography</li>

</ul><p>Our perks are top notch. We are leveraging BB Bastards vendor relationships to get quality hoodies and tees, and of course we are throwing in our new line of eyepro that meets BOTH ANSI and MIL-PRF-31013!</p>
<h3>Underfunding - Over Funding</h3>
<p>If we do not reach our goal, we will assess at that time if we can complete the project with the funds we have attained.

<p><br/>Sounds In Space tells the story of the music monks, a group of people of all races in species out in space who work on developing new music for the love of it. When Travej Sargasso, one of the former students uses his skills to amass personal wealth and power. When word catches his ear that a new style of music that could overthrow him has been developed, Travej captures his former masters, unaware that the the new style had been developed by students. Now it is up to those students Lew Pine and Grace Land to save their masters and bring back music to space. </p>

<p>A bit about main parts of development.</p>
<p>All scenes and characters are <b>unique hand drawn</b> by our artists. Game soundtrack is composed for this game only and is not something that one can buy from different audio stock services. Voice acting will be recorded in high quality studio by talented actors. Basicly, we do everything from scratch.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Some things are not easy (or cheap) to get done by a small group. There are many costs associated like studio fees, we need additional software licenses to get game on different platforms and to pay artists for their job. We also need additional funds to get all PR-stuff done. Simple as that. </p>
<p>Even though the game is primary funded by the active team, additional funds are needed to get all things done. Our goal is to deliver <b>fun game</b> with <b>good feeling</b> and <b>unique storyline</b>.</p>
<p>We also want to give something back, so we have arranged a list of things what we can offer in change.   <br/></p>

Inspired by famous point & click games like Curse of Monkey Island, Leisure Suit Larry and many Sierra titles.

Game will be released on major desktop platforms (Windows, OS X), later Frederik will be seen also on mobile platform. 



A bit about main parts of development.
All scenes and characters are unique hand drawn by our artists. Game soundtrack is composed for this game only and is not something that one can buy from different audio stock services. Voice acting will be recorded in high quality studio by talented actors. Basicly, we do everything from scratch.

Some things are not easy (or cheap) to get done by a small group. There are many costs associated like studio fees, we need additional software licenses to get game on different platforms and to pay artists for their job. We also need additional funds to get all PR-stuff done. Simple as that. 
Even though the game is primary funded by the active team, additional funds are needed to get all things done. Our goal is to deliver fun game with good feeling and unique storyline.
We also want to give something back, so we have arranged a list of things what we can offer in change.

What if we surpass our goal more than couple of dollars?
We can add more concept art for game, even press it to fine  books and deliver to you? We have lot's of ideas what we like to give and offer to you all! 
What if we surpass our goal A LOT?
In that case, our dream may come true and we can publish our game on Xbox and Playstation platforms as well! Whoa!


Risks & Challenges in this project Game will be released even without funding, but it won't be what we really want it to be. We have very high standards and if the funding is lacking the development process will take more time, since we have our ""day to day"" jobs also to get the food to the table.

<h3>A Propos</h3>
<p>TOWN CENTER est un jeu de société de 2 à 4 joueurs, complètement en 3 dimensions, à partir de 12 ans.</p>
<p>Une partie dure en moyenne 10 minutes par joueur pendant lesquelles les joueurs vont incarner le role d'un maire qui va construire et gérer le centre de sa ville.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 120px;""><img alt=""Box shot"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img11.hostingpics.net/pics/716542towncenterboxshot2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Il faudra développer sa ville en 3 dimensions : Construire des commerces pour accroitre ses revenus, des appartements pour loger ses citoyens, des bureaux pour leur donner du travail.</p>
<p>Mais n'oubliez pas d'apporter de l'électricité à toutes vos constructions et de toujours garder un oeil sur vos capacités à construire de plus en plus haut  car plus vos tours seront hautes plus elles vous rapporteront des points de victoire à la fin de la partie.</p>
<p>L'acquisition des cubes se fait grâce à un mécanisme original mêlant le bluff et encore une fois la troisième dimension. </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 210px;""><img alt=""pile stacking"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img11.hostingpics.net/pics/712030pilestacking.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 179px; height: 117px;""/></p>
<p>Seuls les maires les plus rusés parviendront à construire les bons modules au bon moment dans la partie. Mais attention à ne pas donner des cubes trop intéressants à vos adversaires.</p>

<h3><strong>Les Cubes spéciaux</strong></h3>
<p>La collecte sur INDIEGOGO va permettre de faire éditer ce jeu de manière professionnelle.</p>
<p>En effet ce jeu existe déjà puisqu'il est sorti en édition très limitée au mois de mai 2012 dans une version semi professionnelle, mais devant la demande sur le salon d'ESSEN12 , nous avons décidé de le mettre en avant et de vous le proposer.</p>
<p>Les très bons retours des joueurs nous ont aussi permis d'améliorer le game play, certains détails ont également été ajouté dans la règle et d'autres situations ont été éclaircies pour vous proposer la version la plus aboutie possible de ce jeu.</p>
<p>D'autre part la taille et le <strong>NOMBRE</strong> des cubes en bois, vue les règles d'empilement possible, fait qu'il est impossible de proposer ce jeu dans un petit tirage. C'est donc pour celà que nous avons besoin de VOUS, joueurs du monde entier, pour permettre de faire exister ce jeu pour le plus grand nombre.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 90px;""><img alt=""game in progress"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img15.hostingpics.net/pics/674576empilementcubes.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>La taille des cubes dans un jeu dit à l'allemande est de 8 mm, mais dans cette édition, nous avons décidé de mettre le paquet et de proposer des cubes<strong> 8 fois</strong> plus gros en volume afin de rendre l'empilement possible sur <strong>5 étages</strong> (et plus gros encore dans la version DELUXE). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Voici d'ailleurs un comparatif de tailles de cubes suivant les versions DELUXE, NORMALE. Nous avons rajouté les cubes en 10mm pour ceux qui possèdent déà la première édition du jeu et les cubes en 8mm pour ceux qui ont l'habitude des jeux avec du Kubenbois dedans... Tout à droite un Meeples pour mieux visualiser les tailles...</p>
<p><img alt=""cubes sizes"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img15.hostingpics.net/pics/686191Cubes.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>Les stickers</h2>
<p>Pour augmenter le réalisme du jeu, nous avons ajouté des stickers (façades et toits) que les joueurs pourront (ou pas) coller sur les cubes avant de jouer.</p>
<p><img alt=""power"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img15.hostingpics.net/pics/269894power.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><img alt=""office sticker"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img11.hostingpics.net/pics/757963officesticker.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
<p>Ils permettent également d'ajouter un peu de complexité au jeu car selon la partie visible de votre ville vue par avion (les toits), le joueur obtiendra des bonus ou malus en argent et points de victoire. Il n'est pas obligatoire de jouer avec , mais celà ajoute une variante passionnante car le joueur doit se demander , en plus des difficultés de construction et de planification, s'il doit ou non laisser visible telle ou telle partie de sa ville en empilant ou pas ce cube sur celui ci.... Plein de choix, plein de choix...</p>
<h2>Réalisme et design <img alt=""the nurse"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img11.hostingpics.net/pics/877102nurse.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
</h2>
<p>Town Center est une représentation de la vision de l'auteur en 3D des jeux vidéos de construction et de simulation de villes.</p>
<p>En concevant ce jeu, l'auteur souhaitait rendre le plus réaliste possible le développement d'une ville. Il s'est donc attaché à recréer, en simplifiant, les noeuds et corrélations entre les différents éléments que constituent le centre d'une ville. </p>
<p>Il a développé le concept de <em><strong>Voisinage</strong></em>, à savoir que les bâtiments d'une ville évoluent en fonction des bâtiments qui leur sont adjacents</p>
<p><img alt=""living with people"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img11.hostingpics.net/pics/613538living.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 696px; height: 330px;""/></p>
<p>Une des phases primordiales du jeu, outre la subtile phase d'acquisition des cubes, est la phase de développement. En effet :</p>
<ul>
<li>Dans une ville, plus il y a de possibilités de travail , plus elle devient attractive et va donc attirer de nouveaux citoyens, développant ainsi les lieux d'habitation, c'est à dire les appartements...</li>
<li>Dans une ville, plus il y a de résidences et donc d'habitants, plus les commerces vont avoir de clients et donc plus ils vont pouvoir se développer, c'est le cas dans Town Center.</li>
</ul><p>C'est la compréhension de ce mécanisme d'évolution simple : Travail--&gt;Citoyens---&gt;Commerces qui vous ferra gagner la partie.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dans une ville, on obtient des revenus de ses commerces, ce qui est le cas dans Town Center</li>
<li>Dans une ville, on obtient des points de victoire quand on a beaucoup d'habitants, c'est le cas dans Town Center</li>
</ul><p>Plus les constructions réussissent à évoluer , grâce à une bonne planification de constructions, plus elles seront grandes et feront marquer de points de victoire (pour les appartements) aux joueurs ou d'argent (pour les commerces) à chaque tour...</p>
<p>Plus les constructions sont faites en hauteur, plus le joueur va gagner d'argent à chaque tour et plus il aura de points de victoire. </p>
<p>Chaque 5 Argent , c'est aussi 1 point de victoire....</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 150px;""><img alt=""player aid"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img11.hostingpics.net/pics/173489playeraid.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 295px; height: 87px;""/></p>
<p>Les règles sont donc simples et realistes, donc faciles à retenir dès la première partie !</p>
<h2>D'ailleurs les règles complètes, où sont elles ?</h2>
<p>En cliquant ici et ici vous aurez la dernière version des règles</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.ludibay.net/towncenter/towncenter_rules_FR.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.ludibay.net/towncenter/towncenter_rules_FR.pdf</a></p>
<h2>Vous avez lu les règles et vous voulez essayer TOUT DE SUITE ?</h2>
<p>Et bien c'est possible! Sans avoir le jeu, grâce à l'informatique et à Christophe Denoize (toooooof le seul humain avec 6 o!!! , son pseudo sur trictrac et BGG )</p>
<p>Mais attention, cette version informatique n'est que la version SOLO du jeu, elle n'est faite que pour comprendre les mécanismes, car le jeu multijoueurs possède une phase supplémentaire d'acquisition des cubes et évidemment plus d'interaction lors du tirage des cubes.</p>
<p>Nous avons ajouté un tutoriel pour ceux qui n'aiment pas lire les règles.</p>
<p>Les graphismes sont ceux de la version NORMALE</p>

<h2><strong>Le contenu et la qualité graphique:</strong></h2>
<p>Dans les 2 premières éditions de ce jeu, la boite et le plateau personnel étaient de qualité médiocre, même si celà n'affectait pas le jeu.</p>
<p>Pour cette édition, nous avons fait appel à un grand illustrateur puisque Sampo Sikio nous a fait l'honneur d'accepter de refaire entièrement les graphismes (Stickers, boites et Plateaux personnels). C'est lui qui a fait les graphismes d'ECLIPSE, entre autres.</p>
<p><em>DEUX VERSIONS DU JEU VOUS SONT PROPOSEES : </em></p>
<p>La version <strong>NORMALE</strong> et la VERSION <strong>DELUXE</strong></p>
<h3>Descriptif de la version NORMALE:</h3>

<li>4 plateaux : De grandes dimensions également : 20cmx20cm </li>
<li>124 Cubes EN BOIS au format géant de 16mm en 6 couleurs, du jamais vu sur le marché !!!</li>

<ul>
<li>Un coffre en bois géant de 42cmx32 cmx15 cm, permettant de stocker le matériel aux dimensions Gulliveriennes.</li>

<h3>Descriptif des extensions que vous pouvez souscrire MAINTENANT:</h3>
<p>Ces deux extensions peuvent être achetées suivant le niveau de souscription auquel vous adhérer. Les extensions coutent 5E de plus actuellement. Plus tard dans le commerce elles seront vendues au prix de 10E, soit 50% de remise</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Extension n°1 :</strong> <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">4 plateaux</span> supplémentaires <strong>ET</strong> <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">12 cubes</span> d'une 7ème couleur, avec deux configurations complètement différentes des zones constructibles de départ. Nous avons voulu simuler la construction de <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">NEW YORK</span></strong>, un ville à la densité incroyablement élevée et qui se devait d'avoir SA version dans Town Center Un plateau topologiquement complètement différent qui perturbera les habitudes des joueurs les plus aguerris . Les 12 cubes vert foncé, permettent d'ajouter les citoyens au jeu de base avec de nouvelles situations et nouvelles possibilités de construction... Celà aurait été dommage de construire une ville morte !!!!</li>

<strong>Extension n°2</strong> :<span style=""text-decoration: underline;""> 4 plateaux</span> supplémentaires <strong>ET</strong> <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">9 cubes</span> d'une 8ème couleur. En tant qu'éditeur français, nous avons demandé au créateur de nous faire un plateau spécial <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">PARIS</span></strong>. Et voici ce qu'il nous a proposé, des ponts, la Seine, les iles.... De quoi varier les configurations à l'infini. Les 9 cubes marrons permettront de créer un plateau de départ en 3 dimensions avec des scénaris de départ fournis dans les règles ( <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">San Francisco</span></strong> et <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Rome</span></strong> ou complètement aléatoire)</li>

</h2>
<p>Le projet est de réunir les fonds nécessaires pour lancer le tirage du jeu chez le fabricant Allemand LUDOFACT pour le printemps 2013. La qualité de la production (plateaux, boitage, peinture des cubes) est à nos yeux essentielle afin que le matériel soit de qualité supérieure.</p>
<p>En complétant le financement vous participerez, tous, au projet et particulièrement au cout des illustrations, à la fabrication des cubes géants de 16mm, la réalisation des grands plateaux personnels...</p>
<p>Garder la production en Europe a également un petit surcout, mais celà nous semble mieux adapté à notre politique de qualité et de distribution étant basé en France.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 240px;""><img alt=""ludofact"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img11.hostingpics.net/pics/299579logode.png"" src="""" style=""width: 109px; height: 141px;""/></p>
<p>L'ensemble s'élève à 10 000 Euros. Le magasin LUDIBAY existant sur le marché du jeu depuis plus de 8 ans, on peut faire confiance à son sérieux afin que la fabrication et la distribution soient parfaites, encore une fois !</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Notre vision de la souscription</strong></h2>
<p>Nous ne sommes pas des fervents défenseurs du système de crowdfunding, surtout si celui ci ne permet pas de donner de <strong>REEL</strong>S avantages à ceux qui nous aideront à souscrire à ce projet. Ludibay est un magasin de jeux sérieux et reconnu dans le monde ludique et c'est pourquoi nous garantissons que si vous souscrivez à ce projet, vous aurez :</p>
<p>- Un COUPON DE 5E, valable sur site <a href=""http://www.ludibay.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.ludibay.net</a> pour toute commande au niveau VILLAGE ou supérieur, valable sur l'ensemble du magasin</p>
<p>- Votre jeu <strong>2 mois avant</strong> les boutiques : Rien de plus horripilant que de souscrire à un projet et d'attendre son jeu pendant plusieurs semaines, puis de la voir disponible dans la boutique en bas de chez soi ! Ici pas de surprise, nous distribuons le jeu et nous le stockons, donc dès réception dans nos entrepots, nous vous garantissons qu'il sera chez vous 2 mois avant l'envoi aux boutiques, et ce partout dans le monde !!!</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 150px;""><img alt=""2 months before"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img11.hostingpics.net/pics/3924492mois.png"" src="""" style=""width: 205px; height: 161px;""/></p>
<p>- La qualité au <strong>meilleur prix</strong> : en souscrivant maintenant, vous nous aidez dans notre projet, c'est à dire que vous limitez le nombre d'intermédiaires en achetant directement à l'auteur du jeu et à son fabricant. Pour celà le souscripteur est en droit d'attendre un prix plus bas que s'il avait acheté sa boite dans le commerce. Nous garantissons donc un prix d<strong>'au moins 20% moins che</strong>r que le prix boutique qui sera proposé à 35Euros (28E là tout de suite)</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 210px;""><img alt=""discount"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img11.hostingpics.net/pics/27096820off.gif"" src="""" style=""width: 142px; height: 140px;""/></p>
<p>- <strong>Des goodies</strong> : Comme nous l'avons dit plus haut, l'avantage de ce système est de supprimer les risques d'investissement. Mais si le montant est atteint, alors nous pourrons produire , sans risque de pertes, plus de matériel et donc améliorer les possibilités du jeu. Nous avons décidé de proposer aux souscripteurs DEUX extensions.</p>
<p>Ces DEUX extensions sont accessibles à un tarif très avantageux pour ceux qui décident de nous soutenir pendant les 45 que durera la levée de fonds.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 180px;""><img alt=""expansions at half price for town center"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img15.hostingpics.net/pics/244930505.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ces DEUX extensions complètent et étendent les concepts fondamentaux du jeu. Elles s'adressent à des joueurs plus exigeants ou à des joueurs voulant nous aider à la réussite du projet.</p>
<h2><strong>Que se passe-t-il à la fin des 45 jours ?</strong></h2>
<p>Si le montant est atteint ou dépassé, alors nous payons le fabricant (LUDOFACT).</p>
<p>Les délais de fabrication sont de 6 semaines à cette période de l'année. Donc nous transmettrons immédiatement les fichiers à l'usine dès la fin de cette campagne.</p>
<p>Un mail vous sera envoyé dès que nous recevrons le jeu dans nos entrepots (début août). Suivant la destination vous aurez votre jeu à la mi aout. </p>
<p>Comme convenu, les boutiques auront le jeu à la fin du mois de septembre.</p>
<h2>Les frais de port</h2>
<p>Suivant le niveau de souscriptions auxquels vous souhaitez souscrire, les frais de port sont précisés et doivent être ajoutés au montant du niveau souscrit selon la zone géographique.</p>
<p>exemple : Vous décidez de souscrire au niveau VILLAGE+ à 35€ ET vous habitez en France. Les frais de port sont donc de 5€: votre total pour cette commande est donc de 35+5 = 40€. Il ne vous reste plus qu'à envoyer un paiement de 40€</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A NOTER QUE POUR LA FRANCE, LE COUPON DE 5E EN FAISANT UNE COMMANDE SUR LUIBAY VOUS PAIE LES FRAIS DE PORT</p>
<h2><strong>A propos du porteur du projet</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>L'auteur : <img alt=""auteur"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img11.hostingpics.net/pics/875161photo.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 35px; height: 45px;""/></strong></h3>
<p>""J'ai 38 ans, et depuis 10 ans, je crée des jeux et particulièrement des extensions pour le plus célèbre des jeux de train, Age of Steam. Town Center est mon deuxième projet sérieux. C'est une version simplifiée d'un autre gros jeu qui est en développement depuis 2007 et qui sortira en fin d'année prochaine, formant avec Card City un ensemble de 3 jeux indissociables.</p>
<p>J'aime les jeux qui ont un but simple mais dont les moyens pour y parvenir sont complexes et dont l'arbre de résolution est infini.</p>
<p>J'aime les jeux de connection en général ( Hex, ConHex, Dvonn...) et les jeux plus simples pour enfants en 3D avec beaucoup de matériel (Le Fou volant, l'île infernale, La couse aux Baobabs...) et vous retrouvez toujours dans mes jeux une composante connexe ou de connections, sans doute mon coté ageofsteamien ou mon coté mathématicien qui ressort, malgré moi, je vous jure !!!</p>
<p>Je n'aime pas les jeux pour lesquels le but est compliqué et les moyens sont simples pour y parvenir, c'est à dire les jeux dont il existe 100 000 facons de marquer des points de victoire...""</p>
<p>Si vous vous reconnaissez dans ce profil, si vous avez aimez le premier opus Card City, alors vous ne serez pas déçu avec ce jeu qui exploite à fond la composante 3 dimensions, comme on a rarement l'occasion de le voir dans les jeux de société.</p>
<p>Si vous avez trouvé Card City, un peu simplet , ici vous aurez de quoi vous triturer les ménages....</p>
<p>A noter qu'il n'est pas nécessaire de connaitre Card City pour jouer à Town Center, Town Center peut être vu comme une version Grand garçon de Card City...</p>
<p>Attention jeu hautement addictif...""</p>

<p>Sampo Sikio s'est fait connaitre du grand public en illustrant le célèbre <strong>ECLIPSE </strong>édité en France par Ystari Games. C''est un artiste scandinave. Vous aimerez en lui les graphismes épurés qui se déclinent à l'infini, son incoparable façon de simplifier les choses complexes en trouvant le symbol ou l'astuce qui fait qu'on comprend du premier coup d'oeil.</p>
<p>Sa patience avec nos demandes a été immense et nous l'en remercions.</p>
<p>Sampo a su gommer le côté abstrait du jeu en proposant un plateau sobre, mais fonctionnel, des stickers visuellement attractifs et une boite avec des personnages reprennant les personnages crées par Fanny dans Card City, afin d'unifier l'ensemble de la trilogie.</p>

<p>Ludibay n'est pas à proprement parlé une maison d'édition, puisque c'est plutôt un magasin de ventes par correspondance de jeux de société, mais Cédric, son patron a su faire confiance à l'auteur Alban Viard pour développer la Trilogie SMALL CITY, dont Town Center est le deuxième opus.</p>
<p>Ludibay a déjà édité Card City, le premier opus de la trilogie SMALL CITY. </p>

<strong>F.A.Q</strong> </h2>
<p>1) Puis je acheter plusieurs exemplaires de la version NORMALE de Town Center ?</p>
<p>Oui, si vous achetez 3 boites en souscrivant au niveau Hameau à 28€, alors vous paierez 28€+28€+28€=84€</p>
<p>2) Puis je combiner et réduire mes frais de port dans ce cas ?</p>
<p>Oui tout à fait, c'est d'ailleurs l'intérêt d'une commande groupée. Les frais de port n'excéderont pas 10€ pour la France, 18€ pour l'Europe et 45€ pour le reste du monde.</p>
<p>3) Si le montant total du projet n'est pas atteint (10 000€), que se passe t il davec mon argent ?</p>
<p>Votre argent vous est INTÉGRALEMENT restitué, pour vous, c'est une opération blanche!</p>

<p>Il suffit d'ajouter le montant du niveau de souscription avec le montant des frais de port indiqués.</p>
<p>6 ) Comment puis je servir du coupon de 5E Offert par LUDIBAY ?</p>
<p>C'est très simple, il suffit d'aller sur le site <a href=""http://www.ludibay/net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.ludiba</a>y.net et de valider une commande en insérant le mot de passe qui vous sera fourni à la fin du projet.

A Propos
TOWN CENTER est un jeu de société de 2 à 4 joueurs, complètement en 3 dimensions, à partir de 12 ans.
Une partie dure en moyenne 10 minutes par joueur pendant lesquelles les joueurs vont incarner le role d'un maire qui va construire et gérer le centre de sa ville.

Il faudra développer sa ville en 3 dimensions : Construire des commerces pour accroitre ses revenus, des appartements pour loger ses citoyens, des bureaux pour leur donner du travail.
Mais n'oubliez pas d'apporter de l'électricité à toutes vos constructions et de toujours garder un oeil sur vos capacités à construire de plus en plus haut  car plus vos tours seront hautes plus elles vous rapporteront des points de victoire à la fin de la partie.
L'acquisition des cubes se fait grâce à un mécanisme original mêlant le bluff et encore une fois la troisième dimension. 

Seuls les maires les plus rusés parviendront à construire les bons modules au bon moment dans la partie. Mais attention à ne pas donner des cubes trop intéressants à vos adversaires.
 


 
Les Cubes spéciaux
La collecte sur INDIEGOGO va permettre de faire éditer ce jeu de manière professionnelle.
En effet ce jeu existe déjà puisqu'il est sorti en édition très limitée au mois de mai 2012 dans une version semi professionnelle, mais devant la demande sur le salon d'ESSEN12 , nous avons décidé de le mettre en avant et de vous le proposer.
Les très bons retours des joueurs nous ont aussi permis d'améliorer le game play, certains détails ont également été ajouté dans la règle et d'autres situations ont été éclaircies pour vous proposer la version la plus aboutie possible de ce jeu.
D'autre part la taille et le NOMBRE des cubes en bois, vue les règles d'empilement possible, fait qu'il est impossible de proposer ce jeu dans un petit tirage. C'est donc pour celà que nous avons besoin de VOUS, joueurs du monde entier, pour permettre de faire exister ce jeu pour le plus grand nombre.
 

La taille des cubes dans un jeu dit à l'allemande est de 8 mm, mais dans cette édition, nous avons décidé de mettre le paquet et de proposer des cubes 8 fois plus gros en volume afin de rendre l'empilement possible sur 5 étages (et plus gros encore dans la version DELUXE). 
 
Voici d'ailleurs un comparatif de tailles de cubes suivant les versions DELUXE, NORMALE. Nous avons rajouté les cubes en 10mm pour ceux qui possèdent déà la première édition du jeu et les cubes en 8mm pour ceux qui ont l'habitude des jeux avec du Kubenbois dedans... Tout à droite un Meeples pour mieux visualiser les tailles...

 
Les stickers
Pour augmenter le réalisme du jeu, nous avons ajouté des stickers (façades et toits) que les joueurs pourront (ou pas) coller sur les cubes avant de jouer.

 
Ils permettent également d'ajouter un peu de complexité au jeu car selon la partie visible de votre ville vue par avion (les toits), le joueur obtiendra des bonus ou malus en argent et points de victoire. Il n'est pas obligatoire de jouer avec , mais celà ajoute une variante passionnante car le joueur doit se demander , en plus des difficultés de construction et de planification, s'il doit ou non laisser visible telle ou telle partie de sa ville en empilant ou pas ce cube sur celui ci.... Plein de choix, plein de choix...
Réalisme et design 

Town Center est une représentation de la vision de l'auteur en 3D des jeux vidéos de construction et de simulation de villes.
En concevant ce jeu, l'auteur souhaitait rendre le plus réaliste possible le développement d'une ville. Il s'est donc attaché à recréer, en simplifiant, les noeuds et corrélations entre les différents éléments que constituent le centre d'une ville. 
Il a développé le concept de Voisinage, à savoir que les bâtiments d'une ville évoluent en fonction des bâtiments qui leur sont adjacents

Une des phases primordiales du jeu, outre la subtile phase d'acquisition des cubes, est la phase de développement. En effet :

Dans une ville, plus il y a de possibilités de travail , plus elle devient attractive et va donc attirer de nouveaux citoyens, développant ainsi les lieux d'habitation, c'est à dire les appartements...
Dans une ville, plus il y a de résidences et donc d'habitants, plus les commerces vont avoir de clients et donc plus ils vont pouvoir se développer, c'est le cas dans Town Center.
C'est la compréhension de ce mécanisme d'évolution simple : Travail-->Citoyens--->Commerces qui vous ferra gagner la partie.

Dans une ville, on obtient des revenus de ses commerces, ce qui est le cas dans Town Center
Dans une ville, on obtient des points de victoire quand on a beaucoup d'habitants, c'est le cas dans Town Center
Plus les constructions réussissent à évoluer , grâce à une bonne planification de constructions, plus elles seront grandes et feront marquer de points de victoire (pour les appartements) aux joueurs ou d'argent (pour les commerces) à chaque tour...
Plus les constructions sont faites en hauteur, plus le joueur va gagner d'argent à chaque tour et plus il aura de points de victoire. 
Chaque 5 Argent , c'est aussi 1 point de victoire....
 

Les règles sont donc simples et realistes, donc faciles à retenir dès la première partie !
D'ailleurs les règles complètes, où sont elles ?
En cliquant ici et ici vous aurez la dernière version des règles
http://www.ludibay.net/towncenter/towncenter_rules_FR.pdf
Vous avez lu les règles et vous voulez essayer TOUT DE SUITE ?
Et bien c'est possible! Sans avoir le jeu, grâce à l'informatique et à Christophe Denoize (toooooof le seul humain avec 6 o!!! , son pseudo sur trictrac et BGG )
Mais attention, cette version informatique n'est que la version SOLO du jeu, elle n'est faite que pour comprendre les mécanismes, car le jeu multijoueurs possède une phase supplémentaire d'acquisition des cubes et évidemment plus d'interaction lors du tirage des cubes.
Nous avons ajouté un tutoriel pour ceux qui n'aiment pas lire les règles.
Les graphismes sont ceux de la version NORMALE

http://www.boiteajeux.net/jeux/tow/partie.php
Le contenu et la qualité graphique:
Dans les 2 premières éditions de ce jeu, la boite et le plateau personnel étaient de qualité médiocre, même si celà n'affectait pas le jeu.
Pour cette édition, nous avons fait appel à un grand illustrateur puisque Sampo Sikio nous a fait l'honneur d'accepter de refaire entièrement les graphismes (Stickers, boites et Plateaux personnels). C'est lui qui a fait les graphismes d'ECLIPSE, entre autres.
DEUX VERSIONS DU JEU VOUS SONT PROPOSEES : 
La version NORMALE et la VERSION DELUXE
Descriptif de la version NORMALE:

Une boite : Très grande, style Les colons de Catane en un peu moins épaisse, c'est à dire 30x30x5, afin de pouvoir ranger l'imposant matériel  , les grands plateaux pour un confort de jeu plus important.
4 plateaux : De grandes dimensions également : 20cmx20cm 
124 Cubes EN BOIS au format géant de 16mm en 6 couleurs, du jamais vu sur le marché !!!
8 Cubes de 8mm pour marquer l'argent possédé par les joueurs.
6 planches de stickers (façades et toits) à coller ou pas sur les cubes
un grand sac noir en tissu.
Une règle illustrée en couleur
Descriptif de la version DELUXE:
Parce qu'il existe des joueurs exigeants et que ce jeu s'y prête d'une manière assez incroyable, nous proposons à la souscription également (et UNIQUEMENT), une version hyper luxueuse, numérotée dont voici le contenu :

Un coffre en bois géant de 42cmx32 cmx15 cm, permettant de stocker le matériel aux dimensions Gulliveriennes.
4 plateaux en bois de 28 cmx 28cm avec impression du plateau (légérement différent du plateau de la version NORMALE pour des raisons graphiques et d'impressions), soit un plateau 2 fois plus grand en surface !!!
124 cubes de 30mmx30mm, pour une manipulation et un plaisir de jeu jamais atteint, en 6 couleurs également.
8 cubes de 10mm pour marquer l'argent possédé.
Une règle du jeu.
un très grand sac en tissus tissu.
Un PDF des stickers si vous souhaitez imprimez les stickers
Voici le coffret
 
Descriptif des extensions que vous pouvez souscrire MAINTENANT:
Ces deux extensions peuvent être achetées suivant le niveau de souscription auquel vous adhérer. Les extensions coutent 5E de plus actuellement. Plus tard dans le commerce elles seront vendues au prix de 10E, soit 50% de remise


Extension n°1 : 4 plateaux supplémentaires ET 12 cubes d'une 7ème couleur, avec deux configurations complètement différentes des zones constructibles de départ. Nous avons voulu simuler la construction de NEW YORK, un ville à la densité incroyablement élevée et qui se devait d'avoir SA version dans Town Center Un plateau topologiquement complètement différent qui perturbera les habitudes des joueurs les plus aguerris . Les 12 cubes vert foncé, permettent d'ajouter les citoyens au jeu de base avec de nouvelles situations et nouvelles possibilités de construction... Celà aurait été dommage de construire une ville morte !!!!



Extension n°2 : 4 plateaux supplémentaires ET 9 cubes d'une 8ème couleur. En tant qu'éditeur français, nous avons demandé au créateur de nous faire un plateau spécial PARIS. Et voici ce qu'il nous a proposé, des ponts, la Seine, les iles.... De quoi varier les configurations à l'infini. Les 9 cubes marrons permettront de créer un plateau de départ en 3 dimensions avec des scénaris de départ fournis dans les règles ( San Francisco et Rome ou complètement aléatoire)

A quoi va servir le financement ? 

Le projet est de réunir les fonds nécessaires pour lancer le tirage du jeu chez le fabricant Allemand LUDOFACT pour le printemps 2013. La qualité de la production (plateaux, boitage, peinture des cubes) est à nos yeux essentielle afin que le matériel soit de qualité supérieure.
En complétant le financement vous participerez, tous, au projet et particulièrement au cout des illustrations, à la fabrication des cubes géants de 16mm, la réalisation des grands plateaux personnels...
Garder la production en Europe a également un petit surcout, mais celà nous semble mieux adapté à notre politique de qualité et de distribution étant basé en France.

L'ensemble s'élève à 10 000 Euros. Le magasin LUDIBAY existant sur le marché du jeu depuis plus de 8 ans, on peut faire confiance à son sérieux afin que la fabrication et la distribution soient parfaites, encore une fois !
 
Notre vision de la souscription
Nous ne sommes pas des fervents défenseurs du système de crowdfunding, surtout si celui ci ne permet pas de donner de REELS avantages à ceux qui nous aideront à souscrire à ce projet. Ludibay est un magasin de jeux sérieux et reconnu dans le monde ludique et c'est pourquoi nous garantissons que si vous souscrivez à ce projet, vous aurez :
- Un COUPON DE 5E, valable sur site www.ludibay.net pour toute commande au niveau VILLAGE ou supérieur, valable sur l'ensemble du magasin

Ici pas de surprise, nous distribuons le jeu et nous le stockons, donc dès réception dans nos entrepots, nous vous garantissons qu'il sera chez vous 2 mois avant l'envoi aux boutiques, et ce partout dans le monde !!!

- La qualité au meilleur prix : en souscrivant maintenant, vous nous aidez dans notre projet, c'est à dire que vous limitez le nombre d'intermédiaires en achetant directement à l'auteur du jeu et à son fabricant. Pour celà le souscripteur est en droit d'attendre un prix plus bas que s'il avait acheté sa boite dans le commerce. Nous garantissons donc un prix d'au moins 20% moins cher que le prix boutique qui sera proposé à 35Euros (28E là tout de suite)

- Des goodies : Comme nous l'avons dit plus haut, l'avantage de ce système est de supprimer les risques d'investissement. Mais si le montant est atteint, alors nous pourrons produire , sans risque de pertes, plus de matériel et donc améliorer les possibilités du jeu. Nous avons décidé de proposer aux souscripteurs DEUX extensions.
Ces DEUX extensions sont accessibles à un tarif très avantageux pour ceux qui décident de nous soutenir pendant les 45 que durera la levée de fonds.

 
 
Ces DEUX extensions complètent et étendent les concepts fondamentaux du jeu. Elles s'adressent à des joueurs plus exigeants ou à des joueurs voulant nous aider à la réussite du projet.
Que se passe-t-il à la fin des 45 jours ?
Si le montant est atteint ou dépassé, alors nous payons le fabricant (LUDOFACT).
Les délais de fabrication sont de 6 semaines à cette période de l'année. Donc nous transmettrons immédiatement les fichiers à l'usine dès la fin de cette campagne.
Un mail vous sera envoyé dès que nous recevrons le jeu dans nos entrepots (début août). Suivant la destination vous aurez votre jeu à la mi aout. 
Comme convenu, les boutiques auront le jeu à la fin du mois de septembre.
Les frais de port
Suivant le niveau de souscriptions auxquels vous souhaitez souscrire, les frais de port sont précisés et doivent être ajoutés au montant du niveau souscrit selon la zone géographique.
exemple : Vous décidez de souscrire au niveau VILLAGE+ à 35€ ET vous habitez en France. Les frais de port sont donc de 5€: votre total pour cette commande est donc de 35+5 = 40€. Il ne vous reste plus qu'à envoyer un paiement de 40€
 
A NOTER QUE POUR LA FRANCE, LE COUPON DE 5E EN FAISANT UNE COMMANDE SUR LUIBAY VOUS PAIE LES FRAIS DE PORT
A propos du porteur du projet
L'auteur : 
""J'ai 38 ans, et depuis 10 ans, je crée des jeux et particulièrement des extensions pour le plus célèbre des jeux de train, Age of Steam. Town Center est mon deuxième projet sérieux. C'est une version simplifiée d'un autre gros jeu qui est en développement depuis 2007 et qui sortira en fin d'année prochaine, formant avec Card City un ensemble de 3 jeux indissociables.
J'aime les jeux qui ont un but simple mais dont les moyens pour y parvenir sont complexes et dont l'arbre de résolution est infini.
J'aime les jeux de connection en général ( Hex, ConHex, Dvonn...) et les jeux plus simples pour enfants en 3D avec beaucoup de matériel (Le Fou volant, l'île infernale, La couse aux Baobabs...) et vous retrouvez toujours dans mes jeux une composante connexe ou de connections, sans doute mon coté ageofsteamien ou mon coté mathématicien qui ressort, malgré moi, je vous jure !!!
Je n'aime pas les jeux pour lesquels le but est compliqué et les moyens sont simples pour y parvenir, c'est à dire les jeux dont il existe 100 000 facons de marquer des points de victoire...""
Si vous vous reconnaissez dans ce profil, si vous avez aimez le premier opus Card City, alors vous ne serez pas déçu avec ce jeu qui exploite à fond la composante 3 dimensions, comme on a rarement l'occasion de le voir dans les jeux de société.
Si vous avez trouvé Card City, un peu simplet , ici vous aurez de quoi vous triturer les ménages....
A noter qu'il n'est pas nécessaire de connaitre Card City pour jouer à Town Center, Town Center peut être vu comme une version Grand garçon de Card City...
Attention jeu hautement addictif...""

 
 
L'illustrateur:                      
 
 
Sampo Sikio s'est fait connaitre du grand public en illustrant le célèbre ECLIPSE édité en France par Ystari Games. C''est un artiste scandinave. Vous aimerez en lui les graphismes épurés qui se déclinent à l'infini, son incoparable façon de simplifier les choses complexes en trouvant le symbol ou l'astuce qui fait qu'on comprend du premier coup d'oeil.
Sa patience avec nos demandes a été immense et nous l'en remercions.
Sampo a su gommer le côté abstrait du jeu en proposant un plateau sobre, mais fonctionnel, des stickers visuellement attractifs et une boite avec des personnages reprennant les personnages crées par Fanny dans Card City, afin d'unifier l'ensemble de la trilogie.
 
L'éditeur:

Ludibay n'est pas à proprement parlé une maison d'édition, puisque c'est plutôt un magasin de ventes par correspondance de jeux de société, mais Cédric, son patron a su faire confiance à l'auteur Alban Viard pour développer la Trilogie SMALL CITY, dont Town Center est le deuxième opus.
Ludibay a déjà édité Card City, le premier opus de la trilogie SMALL CITY. 
 
                                                    
Avec ce projet plus ambitieux, il confirme sa volonté de s'inscrire dans le paysage ludique.
 

F.A.Q 
1) Puis je acheter plusieurs exemplaires de la version NORMALE de Town Center ?
Oui, si vous achetez 3 boites en souscrivant au niveau Hameau à 28€, alors vous paierez 28€+28€+28€=84€
2) Puis je combiner et réduire mes frais de port dans ce cas ?
Oui tout à fait, c'est d'ailleurs l'intérêt d'une commande groupée. Les frais de port n'excéderont pas 10€ pour la France, 18€ pour l'Europe et 45€ pour le reste du monde.
3) Si le montant total du projet n'est pas atteint (10 000€), que se passe t il davec mon argent ?
Votre argent vous est INTÉGRALEMENT restitué, pour vous, c'est une opération blanche!
4) Si le montant est atteint, comment puis être sur que le jeu sera produit et que mon argent servira à la production du jeu ?
Ludibay est un magasin de vente en ligne de jeux avec également un magasin en dur à Dunkerque, France. Il existe depuis plus de 8 ans et possède  le plus gros catalogue de jeux , goodies avec franchise. Il a déja édité le jeu CardCity et avait en 2012 un stand sur le salon d'Essen, le plus gros salon international de jeux.
5) Comment payer les frais de port ? 
Il suffit d'ajouter le montant du niveau de souscription avec le montant des frais de port indiqués.
6 ) Comment puis je servir du coupon de 5E Offert par LUDIBAY ?
C'est très simple, il suffit d'aller sur le site www.ludibay.net et de valider une commande en insérant le mot de passe qui vous sera fourni à la fin du projet. Attention cependant ce bon ne sera délivré que si la somme de 10000E est atteinte. Votre commande vous sera expédiée en même temps que le jeu Town Center

"""" A hidden gem that needs a bigger audience """" Don D from BGG
"""" the 3 D aspect mecanisms in this game are GENIUS"""" Clint Herron
""""Lot of things to discover and explore , just a stellar game """" Ingo Griebsch
TOWN CENTER is a fully 3-dimensional boardgame for 2 to 4 players, ages 12 and up.A game lasts an average of 10 minutes per player, during which each player will embody the role of a mayor who will build and operate the very center of the city.You will develop the town center in 3 dimensions, which means building shops to increase your income, apartments to give an attractive place to for customerscitizens to live, and offices to attract them to work and live and shop in your city!
 
But do not forget to supply power to your buildings, and always keep an eye on your ability to build higher and higher by increasing the height of your elevator. The higher your towers are, the more money you will earn, and the more victory points you will earn at the end of the game.The acquisition of cubes to build your town center is done through a mechanism that combines bluffing and building in three dimensions.
                                           The cleverest mayor, who manages to build the right modules at the right time in the game, will be the winner. But players also must be careful not to leave too many interesting cubes for their opponents….
 


Special Cubes
Your pledge on IndieGoGo will allow us to produce this game professionally.In fact, this game has already been published in May 2012 in a handmade, extremely limited edition, by the author himself; but many requests at the 2012 Essen fair have pushed us to highlight this unique game and offer it to you.
 
           Thanks to very good player feedback, we have also improved the gameplay: Some details have also been added in the instructions, and some situations have been clarified to provide you with the most complete version of this game.
The 3-dimensional system and the stacking concept make it nearly impossible to offer this game in a small print run. This is the reason why we need YOUR help, gamers from all around the world, to breathe life into this game, and bring it to a bigger audience.
 

The size of the wooden cubes in Eurogames is usually 8mm, which may mean nothing to you, but in this edition we have decided to include cubes with 8 times the volume in order to allow players to perfectly stack their cubes with ease. So, you will be handling nice 16mm cubes — and that’s in the NORMAL version. They’re even bigger in DELUXE version!

Stickers

To increase the realism of the game, we are adding stickers (facades and roofs) that players can choose stick to the cubes before playing.
 

 

 
 

Although they add nice visual pop to an already eye-catching game, they are not merely for improved aesthetics: They also add a bit of complexity to the game, because you will get bonuses or penalties applied to your money and victory points, depending on the bird’s-eye view of your buildings’ roofs. You can choose whether you want to play with this variant, but it adds an exciting dynamic, because, in addition to difficulties of construction and planning, a player must also consider whether to leave a beneficial roof visible even though a profitable opportunity to stack on it has arisen. Similarly, just how long can you afford to leave that negative rooftop exposed, waiting for just the right cube? Lots of agonizing choices!Realism and Design  

 
Town Center is the author's 3D vision of the classic video game, SIM CITY, familiar to gamers since 1989, when the first version of game was unleashed on an unsuspecting public…In designing this game, the author wanted to make the development of a city as realistic as possible. He really wanted to recreate the growth and evolution, while simplifying the elements and the correlations between the different aspects that constitute the center of a city.
 
He nurtured the concept of neighborhood, that the buildings of a city evolve as a result of buildings that are adjacent:One of the critical phases of the game, besides the subtle cube acquisition phase, is the evolution phase. In fact:• In a city, if there are more job opportunities, the city becomes more attractive and will therefore attract new citizens, which leads to the development of new housing, such as apartments…• In a city, if there are more homes and therefore more people, commercial areas will have more customers, and therefore they will be able to develop and grow.
…and that’s how it works in Town Center!This reality of urbanization drives city evolution in the game: Work → Citizens → Shops.• In a city, you get income from the shops, which is the case in Town Center.• In a city, you gain prestige as more and wealthier people are living in your apartments; this again is the case in Town Center.The more apartments have managed to evolve and grow, according to development rules, the more the denizens will be happy, and this will reward you with victory points…The more shops are develop, the more money you will earn each turn, which also feeds your victory points.
 

The rules are as simple as they are realistic, and so easy to remember at the end of a full game!But where are the complete rules ?Here and here you will find the final version of the rules. Please bear in mind that the rules layout is still a work in progress — we're still working on editing, tweaking, and adding art and examples to make the rules as clear as possible before the game goes into production. Well, hopefully into production — that's where YOU come in!

 
http://www.ludibay.net/towncenter/towncenter_rules_EN.pdf

You read the rules and you want to try it NOW?Well you can! Before the game even makes it into a box, thanks to those funny things we call “computers”, and the skillful work of Christophe Denoize (a.k.a.toooooof, or 6-O-in-a-row man, on BGG).

 

                                                                      http://www.boiteajeux.net/jeux/tow/partie.phpBut beware, this computer version is only a SOLO version of the game, which allows you to come to understand the mechanisms. In the multiplayer game, there is an additional cube acquisition phase, and obviously more interaction — and much more tension! — in drafting those cubes.We even added a tutorial for those who do not like reading the rules.The graphics used in this computerized solo game are the real graphics for the NORMAL version of the boxed game! Just imagine how nice it is to see that lovely 3D layout in front of you, on your table, where you can look at it from any angle you like….The content and graphical quality:In the first two editions of this game, the box and boards were of a poor quality. Although it did not affect the gameplay, we want to give you the proper mayoral treatment.For this edition, we contacted a great graphic designer, Sampo Sikiö, and we are honored to report that he is completely redoing the graphics (stickers, boxes, and player boards).THE TWO VERSIONS OF THE GAME AVAILABLE TO YOU:NORMAL version:• A nice, large box — large like the Settlers of Catan, i.e. 30cm × 30cm × 5cm, in order to store the massive cubes and the nice, large player boards that give you plenty of room to build a city in the comfort of your own home.• 4 large 20cm × 20cm player boards.• 124 large 16mm wooden cubes in 6 colors, never seen on the market!• 8 standard 8mm cubes to track the players’ money.• 6 sheets of stickers (facades and roofs) to stick on the cubes, if you like.• A large cotton bag for the cubes.• A full-color, illustrated rulebook.DELUXE version:Because there are demanding gamers, and this incredible game is well-suited for it, we are also offering you (and ONLY during the campaign) a hyper-luxurious, numbered extremely limited edition, with everything you see here:• A giant wooden pirate’s chest 42cm × 32cm × 15cm, for storing the components so large they would make Gulliver blush.• 4 wooden boards of 28cm × 28cm printed with graphics (the graphics will be slightly different from the NORMAL version for graphical and printing reasons) which means your player boards will give you twice as much room for your city’s opulence.• 124 cubic 30mmx30mm for handling and fun game ever, also in 6 colors.• 8 medium 10mm wooden cubes to track the players’ money.• A set of rules.• A very large cotton bag.No stickers for this version, but it comes with a PDF so you can print your own stickers, if you want them.

 
THE PIRATE's CHEST : 
 

THE EXPANSIONS:These expansions will never be commercially available later, so for the foreseeable future, the only way you can get them is to back this project! So we recommend that you back this project at the maximum level, so you can get all the goodies!• Expansion No. 1: 4 additional player boards, and 12 wooden cubes in a seventh color, with two completely different starting configurations. We wanted to simulate the construction of NEW YORK: a city with such an incredibly high density has to have its own version of Town Center. The board is topologically completely different, which would alter the deepest-rooted habits of even the most experienced players. The 12 new dark green cubes represent the citizens, which add new situations and new opportunities for construction to the basic game… It would be a shame to build The Big Apple as a ghost town!

 


• Expansion No. 2: 4 additional player boards, and 9 wooden cubes in an eighth color. As a French publisher, we asked the designer to make us a special set of player boards for PARIS. And here is what he sent us: bridges, the Seine, the two small islands… These really should add quite a bit of variety! You will use the 9 brown cubes to create a 3-dimensional player board. During the setup, the cubes are used to create hills and mountains. 2 scenarios are provided in the rules (San Francisco and Rome), but you can also do a completely random setup, or map the topology of your home town! If you crave variety, you can customize the game every time you play!

 

For what will the funding be used?  This project is to raise the necessary funds in order to start production of the game with the renowned German manufacturer LUDOFACT in spring 2013. The quality of the production (boards, boxes, painted cubes) is essential for us to ensure that we provide the mayor (Psst, that’s YOU!) the best possible material to show off to your VIP guests.

 

                                                    Your being a backer for this project will allow us to pay for the costs of graphics, producing the giant 16mm cubes, the realization of large player boards…The total amount of all fees is 12,000 Euros. Ludibay has been a shop for the world of gaming for over 8 years, and more recently we have gotten publishing experience, as well. So, you can trust in our reliability and reputation, and help us make the manufacturing and distribution of Town Center as great as it should be!Our vision of the CrowdfundingWe are not devotees of the crowdfunding system, especially if it does not give REAL benefits to those who help us to fund this project. Ludibay is a serious game retailer and is well known even in the USA: The shop has more than 490 ratings on BoardGameGeek and is an Amazon professional reseller. That is why we guarantee that if you subscribe to this project, you will get:

 
- You get ONE FREE COUPON OF 5E on the web site www.ludibay.net at the end of the campaign if the reach has been reached !!!- Your game 2 months before the retailers: Nothing is more horrifying than funding a project and waiting patiently for your game, only to see it available on the shelves at a local shop weeks before you get yours!
No surprises here: We distribute the game and we store it. So as soon as we receive it in our warehouse, we guarantee that it will be in your hands 2 months before sending it to the shops, anywhere in the world! Also, our high-quality manufacturer is not across some large ocean with a slow and uncertain sea voyage to our warehouse….
 
 
                                          - The best quality at the best price: By subscribing now, you will help us minimize the cost of our project; i.e. you limit the number of intermediaries by buying directly from the author of the game and its publisher. As a result, when you back this project, you are entitled to a lower price than if you had bought your box in a shop. We therefore guarantee a price of at least 20% cheaper than the shop price of 35 Euros: It’s yours for 28 €.
 
                                                - Goodies: As we mentioned earlier, the advantage of this system is to eliminate the risk of the investment. But if you help us reach the target amount, then we can produce the game without the risk of loss, which allows us to include more and better components; so, to broaden the play options for the game, we decided to offer backers TWO expansions.BOTH of these expansions will be available for the backers at half of the MSRP price ONLY during the crowdfunding campaign, and for those who have supported our project during the 45 days.BOTH of these expansions complement and extend the basic concepts of the game. They are intended for more demanding players, or players wanting to help the success of the project.
 

                                  What happens at the end of 45 days?If the amount is reached or exceeded, then we pay the manufacturer (LUDOFACT).Production time is 6 weeks at that time of year. So we immediately send the files to the factory at the end of this campaign.An email will be sent as soon as we get the game in our warehouses (early August). Depending on the destination you will have your game in mid August.As agreed, the retailers will have the game at the end of September.About the project leaders:The Author:  ""I'm 38 years old, I create games and especially expansions for the most famous train game, Age of Steam, and have been doing so for 10 years now. Town Center is my second serious project. This is a simplified version of a more complex game called SMALL CITY. This tremendous game has been in the development phase since 2007 and will be released at the end of this year. These two games will join Card City to form an inseparable trilogy.I like games that have a simple goal but the means to achieve this goal are complex, and whose resolution tree is infinite.I love connection games (Hex, ConHex, Dvonn…) and small, stupid 3D party games with a lot of plastic materials… You probably will always find a connection component in my games. It’s my Age of Steam side, or my mathematics dark side — despite myself, I swear!I dislike games where the goal is superficially complicated and with very simple resolution to achieve that goal, i.e. games in which there are 100,000 ways to score victory points…""If you recognize yourself in this profile, or if you like the first game, Card City, then you will not be disappointed with this game, which makes full use of the third dimension, in a way we rarely get to see in modern boardgaming.If you thought City Card was a bit cheesy, don’t worry: Town Center is a great, brain-burning filler game….Note that it is not necessary to have played Card City in order to play Town Center; Town Center can be seen more as a different interpretation of the same concept as Card City….Warning: This game is highly addictive….”The illustrator:     Sampo Sikiö’s rise to stardom in the boardgaming world was with the very famous game ECLIPSE. He is a Scandinavian artist. You'll love his very pure graphics. His patience with our requests has been immense and we thank him a lot.Sampo succeeded in erasing the abstract side of this boardgame by proposing clear but functional, visually attractive stickers and a box with characters inspired by the characters created by Fanny for the Card City cards, in order to unify the entire trilogy.The Editor:

 
Ludibay is not, strictly speaking, a publishing house, since it is primarily a mail order game store, but Cedric, the boss, has trusted the author, Alban Viard, to develop this SMALL CITY Trilogy, of which Town Center is the second opus.Ludibay has already published Card City, the first installment of the SMALL CITY Trilogy.
 
                                     With this more ambitious project, Ludibay confirms its willingness to explore this fun landscape further.                                            F.A.Q1) Can I order multiple copies of the NORMAL version Town Center?Yes, if you want to buy 3 boxes, back at the Hamlet level at € 28, then pay 28 € +28 € +28 € = 84 € 2) Can I combine and reduce my shipping fees in this case?Yes, absolutely, it is also in our best interest for you to make a bulk order. Shipping costs will not exceed 10 € for France, 18 € for Europe and 45 € for the rest of the world.3) If the total project amount is not reached (10 000 €), what happens to my money?Your money is FULLY returned to you; it is a risk-free transaction!4) If the goal is reached, then how can I be sure the game will be produced and that my money will be used for the production of the game?Ludibay has been an online retailer in Dunkerque, FRANCE for 8 years. We also have a retail shop. We have one of the largest stock of boardgames and goodies in Europe (over 9000 Games and accessories available).
 
We have already published our first game in 2012: Card City. We also had a booth at the 2012 Essen fair, which the largest international exhibition games.
We are not some fly-by-night, rob-you-blind operation! We already have an excellent reputation, and we intend to maintain it!

anybody and didn’t care about nobody. Oh Lilith, why you killed that 
stranger they wonder, as your teeth were soaked in the blood of 
wonders.” – Legend of Lilith BloodroseI'm simply a guy from Finland who has been passionate about video games for a few decades. As 28 year old, I'm still trying to get my name out there.However, as of now I lack funds to make my projects as I want them to really be, and here is where you come in. The Clans universe needs your help to have that extra polish I can't otherwise do in a realistic time frame.
While that 2000€ helps to cover needed part of the development cost, there are higher goals I want to achieve and you can help us to get there and get an awesome game in return once finished.
There are three main expenses from order of cost.Additional Art (This is the most expensive thing and it takes most of the 2000€ I'm asking.)Voice Acting (In a case funding goes exceptionally well, I might voice some scenes.)Additional Music (A few hundred euros go to this.)Expenses so far has been a bit over 1200 euros and mainly has gone to art so far with music taking a few hundred euros.Some of the features include.- Mouse support for movement, menus and combat.- Story heavy focus, if you want a story, you get it.- Crafting system.- Visible monster encounters (it is your choice to engage them.)- A lot of bosses to keep you busy and challenged.- A lot of comedic elements but still retains a serious world behind it.

Now let's take look at the perks.Tier 1 - Clan Recruit - 5€- You get a game once it is completed.- Your name in the credits.Tier 2 - Clan Member - 10€- You get a game once it is completed.- Your name in the credits.- Various high-res wallpapers showing off the characters (up to 3600x2800.)Tier 3 - Clan Adept - 20€- You get a game once it is completed.- Your name in the credits.- Various high-res wallpapers showing off the characters (up to 3600x2800.)- A full manga story based on ""the clans"" universe (at least 10 pages, depends of funding, if we do really well, I will do at least 30 pages long story.)Tier 4 - Clan Master - 40€- You get a game once it is completed.- Your name in the credits.- Various high-res wallpapers showing off the characters (up to 3600x2800.)-
 A full manga story based on ""the clans"" universe (at least 10 pages, 
depends of funding, if we do really well, I will do at least 30 pages 
long story.)- Full OST! Yes, all the music the game project will use for you to listen to plus a few potential extras.Tier 5 - Vampire Master - 80€- All the rewards above plus.- Jonnie91 gives you a free music commission with commercial rights!- Your name in the credits as major funder under ""SPECIAL THANKS"" section.- Your name will be used by one of the vampires.- Lilith Bloodrose will kill your vampire during the game.Tier 6 - Lilith Bloodrose Figurine - 100€- All the tier 1-4 rewards.- Your name in the credits as major funder under ""SPECIAL THANKS"" section.- Your name will be used by one of the vampires.- Lilith Bloodrose will kill your vampire during the game.- Lilith Bloodrose figurine (about 17 cm tall.)I have already made some impact in the indie scene by releasing a free contest entry called ""The Clans - Cursed Souls.""

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are looking to open the best indoor airsoft field in the sarasota/bradenton area. We have a total of  8 years airsofting experience behind us, and are looking to open an extravagant fun place to play, hang out, and be in a safe, fun, family environment. We will have concessions, staging area, 10,000 or more sq ft area to play close quarter airsoft, a small target shooting area and an arcade. We take safety very seriously, but will have the most fun possible. The field area will have a changing theme layout every month. For example, Halloween themes, maps from video games, such as nuke town, and much much more. For safety, full face protection will be required, and fps checks will be done before entering staging area. Rental equipment will be available, ranging from tactical equipment to guns. Separate rooms for parties, and special occasions will be available. Besides free play, and game modes there will also be league play and tournaments. For all your airsoft needs there is going to be a full fledge airsoft pro shop, with guns, ammo, and tactical gear.</p>
