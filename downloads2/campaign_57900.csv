<div>
<p>Hi, I am Teah, founder of Well.Fit. This
business was born out of my passion for creating a unique fitness experience
that takes you out of the gym and keeps you on your toes! I wanted to make
working out and getting fit fun and accessible to everyone in a non-traditional
setting. For the past 5 years I have been organizing and executing urban
bootcamps, working one on one with personal training clients, and running
the Ladies Gun Club; an all women's bootcamp program. From the River Arts
District, to downtown Pack Square, to Carrier Park we have been using every
inch of Asheville to keep people moving, excercising and sweating.   

</p>
<p><span>I have a great team, my husband and my family, each who are key players in one area or another of business development and
management.  We have also created a team of top notch instructors!</span></p>
<p>We plan to open Well.Fit, Asheville's premier indoor cycling and fitness studio,
in December 2015. In order to bring it all together we need a few more funds so
we are asking for your help. I am a born entrepreneur and leader and
opening a cycling and fitness studio has always been my DREAM! We are so
close to making it happen and with your contributions, together, we can do it!!!</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>My name's Audrey, and this is my friend, Bleu. We're moms, as well as </strong><strong>senior students conducting undergraduate research in women's healthcare, economic justice, and family wellness around the world. </strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>We're also both artists with decades of professional creative experience between us.</p>
<h2>We're going to Nepal...</h2>
<p>...to bring aid to one of the poorest countries in the world, where four out of five rural women go without healthcare, and where ""birth trauma"" and ""low birth weight"" are in the top 10 most common causes of death, with ""maternal conditions"" coming in at #13. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>We have an extraordinary opportunity</strong>: in our final quarter before graduation, we'll be traveling to Nepal to support two different organizations-- a women's clinic in the Annapurna region that provides critical,<strong> low-cost care to postnatal women</strong> with prolapsed uteruses (an ostracizing but easily correctable condition that is especially common in Nepali women), and a village clinic in the Khumbu region that provides healthcare for the residents of the sister Sherpa villages Khumjung and Kunde. Additionally, we'll be working with a residential program in Kathmandu, where young girls with injuries, illnesses, and physical disabilities are taken from dangerous circumstances (most living with their mothers in filthy city prisons). The girls are given <strong>shelter, healthcare, food, and education</strong>, while being taught vital life skills like handiwork, computers, martial arts and self defense, until their families are able to support them again. In addititon to our service, <strong>we will deliver critical medical supplies and educational materials to these organizations.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>After we've returned, and to continue raising money for these excellent organizations, we'll be documenting the state of healthcare, motherhood, and the family in rural Nepal through <strong>audio recordings, portrait photography, and storytelling</strong>. When we come home, we'll host a mixed-media exhibit at a public art venue in our city (we've already been granted the space!), where we'll sell prints and greeting cards (professionally printed at a local printing press) featuring our photographs to continue raising money for the clinics and residential program.</p>
<p>Sounds amazing, right?</p>
<p> Thanks to enthusiastic professors, scholarships, and student loans, we've already raised<strong> </strong>enough for: </p>
<ul>
<li>Tuition for the quarter we're away  </li>
<li>Airfare from the US to Nepal  </li>
<li>Necessary photography equipment </li>
</ul>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>So where will your money go? </h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Here's <strong>your</strong> opportunity to offer tangible &amp; lasting assistance to these organizations that reach beyond our volunteerism! Extend the impact of our trip through the purchase and delivery of <strong>critical medical supplies, educational tools, and medical equipment</strong>, as well as <strong>practical technical gear and clothing </strong>for medical practitioners serving remote and high-altitude villages, <strong>warm clothing and shoes</strong> for the village residents (many of whom make due with flip-flops year-round), and <strong>high-quality school supplies</strong> like pencils, calculators, new paper products, and books published after the 1970's. Additionally, we need to raise a bit more money for our personal expenses, which include<strong> travel within the country and our lodging and food</strong> costs. We also hope to offset some of the <strong>childcare expenses</strong> that our families will experience while we're away, and <strong>provide a good living wage to the porters</strong> who will help us carry the supplies to their destinations. </p>
<p>As far as specific medical supplies, it's the basics we're shooting for initially; we want to bring sterile gauze, clinical-grade scissors and scalpels, bulb syringes, speculums, fetoscopes, stethoscopes, nitrile exam gloves, suturing kits, topical analgesic, topical disinfectants... and more.</p>
<p>$8k is the low-ball figure. That gives us $2.5k for medical supplies and equipment, $1k for birth and contraception education materials, $1k for medicines (antibiotics, antifungals, anti-inflammatories, and prenatal vitamins), $1k for technical clothing and shoes, $2k for our personal expenses, and $500 for school supplies. The extra $700 on our goal total is to cover the costs of this online campaign (paypal and indiegogo both take cuts). </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>If we don't raise enough money</strong>, we'll host a few more fundraisers locally. If we can't meet our financing goals by January 2013, we'll cancel the trip (ie, no delivery of supplies, no photographic/storytelling journey) and all the money we've successfully raised will be split evenly between the two clinics and the girl's home, and wired to each of them directly. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>BUT IF WE GO OVER OUR GOAL: </h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Well, here's where it gets exciting!</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Here's a magical wish list of the things we would just really really love to buy for these clinics: </p>
<ul>
<li>A transcutaneous bilirubin monitor ($2.5k)</li>
<li>An external fetal monitor ($3k)</li>
<li>Two high-quality childbirth education sets ($1k for two)</li>
<li>Two laboratory-quality microscopes ($1k each)</li>
<li>Five clinical thermometers ($300 each)</li>
<li>Five Trav-L-Pure water purifiers ($200 each)</li>
<li>A generator (price dependent on size and shipment capabilities)</li>
<li>Two Solar-powered refrigerators ($700 each) </li>
</ul>
<p> ...and so much more!</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute financially at this time, but we've inspired you with our grand project scheme, please pass word along to your friends about this campaign. We're also collecting words and/or art pieces of support and encouragement on 5x5"" sheets of white paper which we'll be turning into sturdy, weatherproof flags to gift to each of the clinics upon our arrival. If you're interested in participating in this way, let me know and we'll work out our collection of your contribution! </p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My name is Lea Josey. On July 11, 2011 my brother-in-law, Matthew Davis (22yrs) was in a motorcycle accident on his way to work.  He and my sister Danielle Davis (24yrs) had just celebrated their 7 month wedding anniversary, when you're newlyweds every month counts.  Matthew suffered multiple fractures but the most troubling was the Severe Traumatic Brain Injury(TBI). Doctors and nurses urged us to remove him from life support giving us the statistics of his injury.  90% of people never wake up from this coma, and the 10% that do cannot retain any semblance of an independent life.  Less than 5% of people with this injury are able to lead anything similar to their previous lifestyle.  Taking him off of life support without even giving him a chance was unacceptable. After 2 months in hospitals Matthew was sent home, because Danielle refused to let him to go a nursing home. Our single mother, Donna Josey, and Danielle cared for Matthew while he was still comatose, fed through a feeding tube, changed, bathed and even did passive therapy to try to maintain his body 24/7 for a month.  After 3 months in a coma, miraculously, Mattie started talking one day.  He was admitted to an acute rehab in Savannah where he is now talking, feeding himself, using the restroom, dressing and bathing his upper body, sitting up on his own, learning to walk and still retain his kind, selfless, funny personality.  Matthew has the medical community in shock, as his recovery is almost impossible and very rarely heard of.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It's important to let other families that suffer from TBI understand the options and meaning behind the medical community's opinions of the outcome of certain injuries.  Nothing is black and white.  Matthew is living proof that anything can happen. The newly married man that was never supposed to open his eyes again, less than 6 months after the injury, is kissing his new wife and will be able to lead a normal independent life with minor mental deficits.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Matthew will be returning home soon and my mother's house is not equipped for his needs. He needs a suitable bathroom so he is able to bathe himself. We also want to close in the garage to give them a place to call their own.  This is a huge financial burden due to the astronomical amount of medical bills pouring in.  Matthew has fought so hard and so long to come this far and not have a place to go home to with his wife. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello. For those of you who do not know me personally, my name is Kaden. To jump into things, I am transgender (FTM). I have been living as male for one year in September of 2012. I have begun HRT (Hormone Replacement Therapy, meaning I receive weekly injections of testosterone.) I will celebrate one year on hormones December 15, 2012.</p>
<p>This fundraiser is about trying to raise money for my top surgery, otherwise known as a double mastectomy. I thought I could put if off longer and wait until I could find a job that offered insurance that covered it, or save the money completely myself. Living with the waiting was hard on me mentally/emotionally, but recently it has become hard on me physically, and I am trying to raise money to have the surgery as soon as possible. About two months ago, I was diagnosed with pleurisy. Currently, I am just getting over pneumonia, which I will probably now be more prone to until I have the surgery. I am in almost constant pain unfortunately. This is because to be read as male and feel comfortable leaving my house each day and feeling true to myself, I bind my chest with something called a binder, to give the appearance of a flat(er) chest.</p>
<p>I have gone through a lot of struggles in my life - to lay it out there, I have struggled with bipolar disorder, anxiety, and an eating disorder. Since beginning this journey of transitioning into my true gender and finally being my true self, I have finally started to become happy and stable and at peace with myself, my life, and so many other things. I have worked hard to get to where I am at today in life, and all I dream about every day is having a body I can be comfortable living in and love.</p>

<h3>What I'm Trying To Raise, and Perks for Your Donation</h3>
<p>I will be having the surgery locally, so I will not need travel/lodging expenses. The surgery itself costs $6,300, as my insurance denied me coverage, but I am hoping to raise the other $1,300 from savings, an online apparel site I started (<a href=""http://www.skreened.com/equalityshop"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.skreened.com/equalityshop</a>) and through a music and drag benefit that is currently in the works.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Hello. For those of you who do not know me personally, my name is Kaden. To jump into things, I am transgender (FTM). I have been living as male for one year in September of 2012. I have begun HRT (Hormone Replacement Therapy, meaning I receive weekly injections of testosterone.) I will celebrate one year on hormones December 15, 2012.
This fundraiser is about trying to raise money for my top surgery, otherwise known as a double mastectomy. I thought I could put if off longer and wait until I could find a job that offered insurance that covered it, or save the money completely myself. Living with the waiting was hard on me mentally/emotionally, but recently it has become hard on me physically, and I am trying to raise money to have the surgery as soon as possible. About two months ago, I was diagnosed with pleurisy. Currently, I am just getting over pneumonia, which I will probably now be more prone to until I have the surgery. I am in almost constant pain unfortunately. This is because to be read as male and feel comfortable leaving my house each day and feeling true to myself, I bind my chest with something called a binder, to give the appearance of a flat(er) chest.
I have gone through a lot of struggles in my life - to lay it out there, I have struggled with bipolar disorder, anxiety, and an eating disorder.

treating cancer. I want to take the treatment, but, of course, it would not be

<p>You may know that every round of chemo costs $19,000 on average.
Patients often go through many rounds of chemo over months or years or until
they die and spend hundreds of thousands of dollars in the process. It astounds
me that the treatment I want only costs $32,000 one time for 4 days and it is
finished. Resistant cancers can take a little longer to stop in their tracks.  Each
additional day over 4 costs $5,000.  No patient to date has needed more than 6

opportunity to take time away from regular life to get the book done.  If

if this is not a good time for you to offer financial support, help spread the
word about it using your own Facebook and email and utilizing the sharing tools
from Indiegogo.</p>
<p>My ultimate goal is not only my own physical healing.  I
want to be a source of encouragement, hope, and information to people seeking a
different way to approach cancer and wanting to stay healthy in the process. Being
able to schedule the treatment would be a fantastic way to start the New Year
for me.</p>

<p>Hello, my name is LeVette Thorne. I am the Executive
Director of The Place at the Lake, Benton County Missouri’s only domestic and
sexual violence organization.  We save
lives every day by helping not only break the cycle of domestic and sexual
violence in the lives of our clients, but also in future generations to come
through education and prevention which helps ensure brighter futures for the
lives of Benton County residents and those in the surrounding area.</p>
<p>This campaign will raise money for operating costs of the
emergency shelter provided to clients in order for our organization to continue
offering domestic and sexual violence services. This is important because our
shelter is usually at full capacity with both in house and outreach clients,
proving and making a definite need for the services The Place at the Lake
provides.  Some people may feel that
domestic violence isn’t a pressing issue in the Unites States, so I kindly ask
you to complete the following exercise and see if you feel it is pertinent. ..</p>
<p>Imagine four of the most important women in your life (mother,
sister, aunt, friend)</p>
<p>Picture their faces clearly!! Happy and smiling!! (But keep
your eyes open so you can read!)</p>
<p>Are you thinking of them?!?! </p>
<p>Can you imagine the color of their eyes, the texture of
their hair, their contagious laugh?!</p>
<p>Now choose one of them….</p>
<p>Focus specifically on just the one….</p>
<p>What qualities do you admire most, her kind heart, her true
sense of self, her intelligence?</p>
<p>Breathe her in for a moment and think of all the reasons why
she is so important to you!</p>
<p>Now imagine someone robbing her of all of the qualities you
hold so dear about her.</p>
<p>Imagine she is one of the millions of women suffering from
domestic and sexual violence each year…</p>
<p><b>What would you give to save her?</b></p>
<p>Did you know that one in four women will become victims of
domestic violence in their lifetime?  It
could be you that help make that statistic one in five, one in fifty, or one in
two hundred. Make a pledge today, make a stand today, save a life today….save
her….she is in someone’s favorite four.</p>
<p>What We Need:</p>
<p>We need to raise $5000.00 to help keep our shelter
open.  This money will be used for
operating expenses included but not limited to electric bills, required Missouri
shelter insurances, water/ gas bill, internet for clients and staff use, food,
toiletries, and shelter repair expenses. </p>
<p>There are several things that make Place at the Lake unique
like the extent of case management, for example staff asks clients to paint a
picture of how they would like to see their lives five years from now any way
they want. Once that image has been conveyed Case Managers immediately start
taking the steps to make their “dream” a reality! And there have been too many
success stories to count! </p>
<p>Also our shelter is like going to grandma’s house! We have a
beautiful country location surrounded by horses, a beautiful back deck and a
family dominated environment! Everyone cooks, eats, and works together to help
keep the house running smoothly! And while all domestic violence shelters are a
true blessing our home is an actual house which is very comfortable and quiet,
not institutional like by any means!</p>
<p>If for some reason Place at the Lake is unable to meet our
entire goal, all funds raised will still be used for their original purpose
which is operating expenses.</p>
<p>The Impact of your Contribution:</p>
<p>By making a contribution to Place at the Lake you will not
only be helping with financial expenses you will literally be helping us break
the cycle of domestic violence in our clients’ lives. YOU WILL BE HELPING
CHANGE THE LIVES OF OTHERS! You will be doing this by allowing us to continue
serving Benton County and the surrounding area, though we take clients from all
over the United States. </p>
<p>It doesn’t stop in this area though. Have you ever watched
rain come down on still water and witnessed the ripple effect that extends
outward at the place of impact? The same thing happens with domestic violence
survivors. They reach out and touch lives for the duration of their time on
this earth, helping others who have suffered as well, live a life free of abuse.
This makes the possibilities endless, literally endless! So while the place of
impact may be Benton County Missouri the ripple effect can touch California,
New York, China, Spain, etc! </p>
<p>Also, we need your help because Benton County is very rural
area with very limited funding sources. I ask you right now to remember the
special lady you had thought of in the very beginning of the exercise. Would
you save her if it meant a small monetary donation? You may be telling yourself
someone else will do it, maybe Place at the Lake isn’t even located in your
area! While we may not be located in your area we are all connected. We are all
in this country, and population of this world. So while we may not be next door
neighbors per say, we are figuratively just a couple of blocks away!</p>
<p>Risks and Challenges:</p>
<p>While I mentioned before that Benton County is located in a
rural part of Missouri and funding is limited, we have made a plan to conquer
these hurdles by reaching out to you and explaining that YOU can make the
difference in someone’s life TODAY!</p>
<p>Ways You Can Help:</p>
<p>I realize that times are tough and money is tight, so I
would like to thank you in advance for the kindness and generosity you shown
through your donation.</p>
<p>Also please share our link on your facebook, twitter, and
other social media accounts! Take a second to forward this to people in your
email contact list! Everything you do to help today is greatly appreciated! And
one last request. Reach out to that special lady in your life that came to mind
earlier. Let her know how valuable and loved she truly is! <span>J</span> </p>

<span>Ole Kassow started <a href=""http://cyclingwithoutage.org/about/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cycling Without Age</a> as a way of helping nursing home residents get back into society. As a cycling Copenhagener for whom the bicycle as transport is a given, Ole felt the need to help those with limited mobility. His solution? A classic Copenhagen rickshaw (see picture below). He was inspired by an elderly man, Thorkild, from his local nursing home and he offered to take him for a ride. </span>

<span><p><span>The reward of giving someone the experience of mobility and wind in the hair was indescribable. Before we knew it, Cycling Without Age spread to many cities in Denmark and beyond.

<p><span>We have passionate local ambassadors around the world who are working hard to start Cycling Without Age in their community.

<p>Each take-off package (bike, transport, education, transfer of know-how and campaign fees) costs <b>8,200 USD</b>. The number of licensees is increasing all the time. With this campaign we hope to raise money for bikes and know-how for at least 12 cities, but our wildest dream is that we can raise money for all 25 or 30 cities, so we can get them started down this amazing road. In total, we need <b>98,000 USD</b> for 12 cities. If we don’t reach our full campaign target, we will help kickstart as many cities as we can. Just one bike in a city can make a huge difference to 20 volunteers (called rickshaw pilots) and 100 elderly citizens. The elderly will once again be handed the opportunity to connect with their local community and the people in it.</p>

<p><strong>Why Physical Therapy In Your Pocket?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rick Good (the taller fellow in the picture) and I (Rod Sheffield) have been making products together in San Diego for the past 20 years.  He and I also have gone on a number of backpacking trips together.  At the time of this photo, I had recovered from several accidents, resulting in two broken arms, a couple of compressed vertebrae, and two broken legs.  I have done a lot of physical therapy exercises.  I have come to realize that I need to do those exercises daily, not only to recover quickly from an injury, but also to keep mobile.  My set of exercises is large enough that I need more than just the paper handouts given to me at the therapist office.  I’ve also done those exercises for long enough that I need a reminder about how to do them properly, and which ones I do each day.  Finally, I need to have continued feedback with the therapists so that they can upgrade my exercises when I get stronger in various areas of my body.  These needs can all be satisfied if only I had the proper mobile application on my smart phone, connected to an application my physical therapists use.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What our campaign is about.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>One of Rick’s product suites is comprised of software that does what I need.  He has created a mobile app that runs on an iPhone. That app downloads the latest set of exercises from a Cloud server accessed by a number of physical therapists.  He has created a Java program that the therapists use to organize the various exercises into protocols for daily use.  An important feature of Rick’s product suite is that the iPhone app and the therapists’ application communicate.  Daily progress is monitored, resulting in continuously tuned therapies based on actual progress.  My physical therapists can truly be in my pocket all the time, coaching me through my exercises, and receiving my inputs regarding exercise effectiveness.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The product suite has been used by The Egoscue Method <a href=""http://www.egoscue.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.egoscue.com</a> , a pain and posture therapy business, for the past 8 years.  The various parts of the product suite have been tuned over that time, yet there are areas where it can become even more effective. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The first and most important change we wish to make in this campaign is to improve the exercises.  There are 500 Egoscue exercises that exist in both annotated stills and on line videos.  We will improve these exercises by converting them to animation videos.  The animation videos allow for much more control when being used by the patient on Rick’s eCoach smart phone app.  We will use OpenGL to create these animation videos so that they can easily be played on a variety of smart phone operating systems. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We will integrate this new animated video format on Rick’s existing iPhone eCoach app during this campaign.  We will also update the Java application that the therapists use to an iPad app (PT Planner).  This will enable more efficient capture of stills and video while the therapist is doing examinations in the clinic. That information will be automatically uploaded into the Cloud repository with the patient’s protocol history. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Where your funding is going.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The conversion of videos into animation is a complicated process.  We have gotten estimates from professionals specializing in that process.  We will use $100,000 of our funding goal to convert the first 200 exercises.    Selecting which exercises to convert for physical therapy is estimated to use $25,000 of our funding.  The remaining $25,000 will be used to integrate the new animation videos into our apps, which are already underway.  We are using the IndieGoGo flexible funding vehicle so that we can get an early start on converting as many videos as possible.  Should we exceed our funding goal, we will select even more videos to convert so that we cover as many physical therapy protocols as possible.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How everyone benefits.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Not everyone has had quite as many injuries as I have.  However, there are nearly 2 million people in the US alone doing physical therapy daily and that number is growing rapidly.  According to the 2011 Bureau of Labor Statistics report, physical therapy is the fastest growing health business.  Use of our product can make a substantial difference to the recovery time of millions.  We are committed to getting our products out as quickly as possible, and to as many providers as we can.  Your funding will make that happen.  A select group of contributors will also get a chance to use, evaluate, and provide feedback on eCoach.  We encourage everyone, contributors and non-contributors alike, to talk to their physical therapists and health care providers, about getting the PT Planner app to use.  Even the best tool is no good if it is not used. </p>

Not everyone has had quite as many injuries as I have.  However, there are nearly 2 million people in the US alone doing physical therapy daily and that number is growing rapidly.  According to the 2011 Bureau of Labor Statistics report, physical therapy is the fastest growing health business.  Use of our product can make a substantial difference to the recovery time of millions.  We are committed to getting our products out as quickly as possible, and to as many providers as we can.  Your funding will make that happen.  A select group of contributors will also get a chance to use, evaluate, and provide feedback on eCoach.  We encourage everyone, contributors and non-contributors alike, to talk to their physical therapists and health care providers, about getting the PT Planner app to use.  Even the best tool is no good if it is not used.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Our enhanced battery management system enables you to train a whole month (21+ hours of training) on one single charge. Furthermore, the fast charge function charges the band to 50% in only 20 Min.The STRAFFR band has not only been invented and designed in Germany, but the main components are also produced and assembled here, ensuring the quality you expect from a premium sporting device. The band behind the band: Volker, Stefan, Torben and Hanno all have a passion for sport, but understand how a busy lifestyle can get in the way of staying on track. So, they banded together to make STRAFFR a reality. They all have backgrounds in engineering and tech, producing the functioning prototype and coding the STRAFFR app themselves. They know what is needed to take things to the next level and get STRAFFR to serial production and can't wait to get the bands into your hands! Your smart fitness journey is almost ready to begin.TAKING A LOOK AT THE CURRENT STRAFFR BAND AND APP PROTOTYPE

 
WHAT DOES THE FUTURE HOLD?Risks and challengesSweat, blood, tears and a lot of love went into the development of our prototype to make STRAFFR available to you. We have built a fully functioning prototype in hardware and software. Yes, the whole system works and has been tested by real people! Our band design underwent long term testing and the electrical and mechanical designs have been approved. The app design is fully functioning and has been tested and approved for launch. As with any hardware production, issues may arise in the process which could delay shipment, but due to our close relationship with our manufacturer and development partners, we don't foresee any issues prohibiting us from getting STRAFFR to you as soon as possible. Our main challenge is to deliver the best possible user experience - seamless integration of software and hardware.",25.0,3,"1 Campaign

<p>The scout hut that serves as home to our Boy Scout Troop 228 was originally a railroad depot.  The railroad came to New London, Minnesota in 1886.  Shortly thereafter this depot building was constructed from local materials.  Our Boy Scout Troop 228 adopted the building when it was no longer needed as a depot building.  In 1976 under the direction of scoutmaster Norm Peterson the building was moved to the current location.  The current location is on a generous gifted long term lease property from Peace Lutheran Church.  Now the property needs to be sold to a different owner and our lease will come to an end.  </p>
<p>                       History of New London Boy Scout Troop 228</p>
<p>New London Troop 228 was founded and chartered in 1920.  There was a brief hiatus during World War II when all able bodied citizens were working on the war effort.  Outside of that this troop is nearing 100 years of chartered service to boys, young men and community.  The troop has helped develop hundreds of young men.  Our troop has now awarded 75 Eagle Scout awards.  If one considers the national average of less than 2% of scouts go on to the Eagle rank then our troop has served thousands of young men.  We continue to have a very active troop with more than 30 currently enrolled Boy Scouts.</p>
<p>                         The building and the troop are inseparable</p>
<p>The video materials that we have attached were filmed, directed and edited by our scouts.  No parent involvement.  The video captures the spirit of the connection between the building and the boys in the troop.</p>
<p>                                          Saving a historic building </p>
<p>We have met with building movers and have determined tht the building is structurally sound and appropriate to move.  We have secured a new location for the building within our community.  We have decided that it is important to save the building for the sake of our troop and for the historic character it brings to our community.</p>
<p>               Ryane Clark, our Eagle Scout, Army veteran and American hero</p>
<p>Ryane Clark is an Eagle Scout from our troop.  He was drawn to law enforcement as a career.  He attended the law enforcement program at Aleandria Technical College in Alexandria MN.  He felt a call to serve all of us and his country in the United States Army.  In October of 2010 Ryane Clark was serving with his unit in Afghanistan.  His unit took enemy fire and Ryane was killed in action by a rocket propelled grenade.  He gave his life in service to his country and to all of us in protecting our freedom.  Boy Scout Troop 228 was able to welcome his body home at the airport and to assist at his funeral in New London, Minnesota.  Ryane would have been proud of his troop.</p>
<p>                                  Help us honor Ryane and his legacy</p>
<p>In addition to moving our hut and Ryane's former scout home we plan to augment Ryane's Eagle Scout project and to fund a perpetual scholarship fund in Ryane's name.  For his Eagle project, Ryane developed a trailhead parking area for our local trail.  The area is in need of further updating and completion.  We want to help his family complete the project.  Ryane's college scholarship fund is already in place and functional.  It simply needs more funds.  Our troop dreams of offering a check to his family and the fund to guarantee that Ryane's memory will be invoked every year as the fund offers an annual scholarship to a deserving student.  It takes a large amount of money to fund a perpetual scholarship gift but we think it is possible.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>                                                         Already at work</p>
<p>No Boy Scout waits for a hand out.  Our troop has been hard at work with fundraisers like spaghetti feeds, boy scout work-hour auctions, silent auctions and a well supported Eagle Scout matching grant effort.  We will continue to do this work.  We pledge that your tax deductible donation will go directly toward our efforts.  We have no troop overhead.  Like every Boy Scout troop we function with all volunteer time and this project will be no different.  We want to put every dime possible into Ryane's scholarship fund.  This is our incentive to be completely prudent with every cent you give.   The scouts and leaders of New London Troop 228 look forward to showing each of you our completed projects and the shared pride we will all have when the Ryane Clark memorial scholarship is fully funded.

<h3>What the heck?</h3>
<p>So Steve has these teeth. They're crookedy and charming, but some of them are needing some (okay, a lot) of work. One of his teeth (fortunately not one of the *really* cute ones) needs to come out, another is going to require an herculean effort to save, and there are root canals and crowns and all sorts of nasty things that will have to be done.</p>
<p>Our Steve is an educator, so naturally he doesn't get paid even close to what he's worth. He has some insurance, but does *anybody* have enough dental coverage? No. But if all of us band together, we can raise enough money to pay for his dental work, and maybe even get enough so he can take a couple of days off to recover from all this oral torture. </p>
<p>If you're reading this, you probably know how wonderful Steve is. If you don't, this man is the salt of the earth. He adores his children, and he has a smile that would stop traffic. He's one of nicest and kindest and funniest people in the whole world. Let's show some love and keep him healthy and smiling!</p>

<p>I'm John, a single 49-year-old man born and living in Santa Rosa, California.  I've been overweight as long as I can remember.  My top weight was 440 pounds.  I've tried multiple times to lose weight and have been somewhat successful, but have never reached goal, and have always put some back on.  I was diagnosed with type-2 diabetes at my top weight.  The lowest I've gotten was 238 pounds.  When I look in the mirror, I don't recognize myself.  I have one photo of myself as a thin child.  When I was at my lowest weight, I had a shock of recognition.  I saw that thin child.</p>
<h3>What I'm Trying to Do</h3>
<p>My goal, and the goal of this campaign, is for me to permanently lose weight, get fit, and get off my diabetes medication.  My most recent top weight is 383 pounds on May 31st, 2013.  As of today, August 6, 2013, I weigh 345.  I've done this by weighing and measuring my food, using the My Fitness Pal app and website to track my food and exercise, and riding my bicycle.</p>
<p>I need a new bicycle.</p>
<p>At my current weight, my bicycle is causing serious pain and impeding my ability to make progress.  I bought it brand new in 1991.  I've looked on the internet and talked to local bike shops about what I can do to make my bike more comfortable.  Frankly, my bike is too old and some of the specs are odd.  It would cost a lot of money to make the needed changes and it makes more sense to purchase a new bike.</p>
<p>I would use the bike as my primary mode of exercise and as transportation.  The weather in Santa Rosa and the roads are conducive to riding almost year-round.  What's a little rain?</p>
<p>The bike I'm looking at is nothing fancy, i.e., not carbon fiber, no suspension, etc.  The most fancy thing on it is disc brakes, since it takes a lot to stop this big fella, and they're better in the rain.</p>
<p>The gratitude I would feel is immeasurable.  Being obese, yes morbidly, has affected every aspect of my life.  My health, my self-esteem, my relationships (or lack of them), and my employment.</p>
<p>I am hoping to raise $569.99 US.  With this money, I will complete purchase of a bicycle for my use to get healthy and for transportation.  I will provide documentation of the completed purchase.  The bicycle originally cost $869.99.  I had not anticipated crowdsourcing and have already deposited $300.</p>
<h3>What You'll See</h3>
<p>You will see my progress towards my fitness goal by following me on Facebook, My Fitness Pal, or other arrangements can be made.  I plan on participating in cycling events and competitions as I progress and will post about these as well.</p>
<p>I've lost 150 or more pounds more than once.  I know I can reach my goal! I will get there!  You can help.  I have never been a normal weight in my adult life, so I've set a temporary goal of 200 pounds.  I will reevaluate this goal as I get closer and can make a more infomed decision.</p>
<h3>You Can Help</h3>
<p>I know you may not be able to contribute with money, but you can still help.  Make some noise, spread the word, let others know about what I'm trying to do.  Oh, and don't forget to use the Indigogo share tools.  Constructive feedback is also helpful.</p>
<p>Gratefully,</p>

<br/><h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>My wife, Grace and I believe that everything to heal our bodies was left here on planet Earth by God. We believe plant oils have the ability to heal our physical and emotional bodies and we've seen some miraculous healing using essential oils from plants. <br/></p>
<p>When I broke my left clavicle in 1998, Grace used four (4) plant oils on my broken ""collar bone"" that stopped my bone pain in 1 or 2 minutes and that pain has never returned! From that day forward, I've been studying, blending and researching plant oils. <br/></p>
<p>I teach clinical aromatherapy to my Massage Therapy students at our local Community College. I am certified in Clinical Aromatherapy. I studied 300 hours at the Institute of Spiritual Healing &amp; Aromatherapy. <a href=""http://www.ishaAromatherapy.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.ishaAromatherapy.com</a>  Grace and I have been teaching therapeutic massage and related courses since 1995 and still enjoy helping caring students pursue their dream of becoming a licensed massage and bodywork therapist.<br/></p>
<p>Grace and I are passionate about helping people accelerate their healing by using therapeutic grade essential (plant) oils. We use essential oils virtually every day.</p>
<p>Our dream is to start an Aromatherapy Factory where people can purchase  Organic and Vegan lotions and cremes filled with organic and wildcrafted plant oils through an online web site.  We'd like to start producing our Pain Potion © and Pain Potion Plus ©.</p>
<p>Your support will help make our Dream and Passion a real business. A business that may help provide many people the opportunity to try something natural for the relief of fibromyalgia, sore feet, tired muscles and joint pain.</p>

<p>""This oil relieved pain that I was having in my elbows as well as my neck. My Father has arthritis in his knees and after this oil was rubbed into both knees, he was able to move them more freely and ambulate without pain. It is great that a remedy that is all natural will restore mobility and relieve pain without all the side effects that so many other medications and analgesics usually produce. I strongly recommend this all natural analgesic oil for pain relief.""</p>

I was able to stretch the ankle more effectively and with less pain since first injuring the ankle five weeks ago. I also noticed that I was able to tolerate deeper soft tissue therapy to help improve the circulation to the area. I would welcome the opportunity to speak with you about testing this pain blend in our office.""</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>General Coach T Info</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>Q: Who is Coach T targeted for?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>We created Coach T primarily to help novice tennis players learn faster and more efficiently. It can also be used for tennis coaches, as well, allowing them to teach their students more efficiently and track their progress.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is Coach T secure when it’s tied to your racket?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  In order to prevent Coach T from falling off your racket when playing, we added a number of mechanical fasteners. It’s passed a number of designs and vigorous tests so we are confident that Coach T will be safe and secure when playing.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How did you implement the functions of Coach T?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Coach T features the latest Intel chip, Curie, which is about as small as a button and offers excellent performance. With CurieNeurons, Coach T can recognize any movement and offer feedback, which is why Coach T can improve the tennis learning experience with real-time instructions.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I change the color of my Coach T?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>You can easily change the color by replacing the silicone strap. We offer a variety of straps so you can personalize it as you wish. It’s about as easy as changing cell phone cases so you’ll be ready in no time.</p>

</div></div>","Coach T is an AI assistant for tennis players of all backgrounds. It aims to revolutionize how you learn tennis, ultimately helping your game and saving you money. Built with an Intel Curie chip, Coach T is placed on the tennis racket and analyzes your stroke movements, help tennis beginners correct their movements by delivering coaches' instructions in real time, just like the real coach is beside you.
A set of Coach T includes：

1. RACKET DEVICE

2. BLUETOOTH HEADSET
Coach T will revolutionize your tennis learning experience!
 


 


 


STEP 1. Place Coach T on the throat of your racket and connect it with your smartphone via Bluetooth.

STEP 2.  Coach T records the strokes of your racket, as well as the comments and feedback, given by your private coach, such as “finish higher”, finish lower”, or “nice shot!”

STEP 3.  When practicing alone, you can then wear Bluetooth-connected headphones and listen to your coach's instructions based on your swings. When you swing your racket, you will hear your coach's voice based on the movements of your swing. It feels like your coach is right by your side.












 



 



To further improve the record and analysis functions of Coach T, we use the Curie module, released by Intel earlier this year. The neuron networks in Curie automatically recognize and categorize movements.
Coach T recognizes your swing movements and matches it with your coach's vocal feedback, allowing you to improve your strokes with your coach's guidance even when the lesson is over.

Whether you want to save your top 10 favorite videos or abs workouts or combine your favorite warmup, workout and cool-down, you'll be able to completely streamline your fitness experience. Playlists will also play automatically back-to-back. Instead of looking for a warmup, then searching for a workout, then a sizzler, you simply store your favorite combos in a playlist and press once!</p>
<p>- Share your workout video playlists with friends and family via social media to encourage others to get fit. Know a friend who travels a lot and wants to get back in shape? Share your hotel room workout playlist! The options are truly endless to inspire others to make a change. Also, you will be able to share playlists with other StreamFIT members within the website.</p>
<p>- Create your own training plans by week, month, or year with an integrated calendar/scheduling function. This will also allow you to track your compliance to see how consistent you've been with your workouts. You'll be able to share these with other members or on social media in addition to searching the ever-growing database for new training plans. The more members who share their training plans, the more training plans all StreamFITTERS will have to choose from!</p>
<p>- Film 50 more streaming workout videos featuring more equipment-free calorie-killing routines you can do anytime, anywhere. Plus, you'll be able to vote for which types of workouts you want us to film!</p>
<p>- A StreamFIT community where all members can get to know one another, share their favorite workout/nutrition tips, and just have a virtual hangout spot with other like-minded fitness lovers from all over the world!</p>
With your help we'll be able to create the most complete online fitness experience the world has ever seen!</div>
<h3><em><strong>Think of how great it will be to store and share playlists of your favorite workouts and have a community of StreamFITTERS sharing training plans with each other!</strong></em></h3>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $100,000 of total funding. Most of the money will go to development and testing for all of the aforementioned website features. Of course, a percentage will go to Indiegogo fees and rounding up the fabulous awards we've put together for you. Remaining funding will be used to produce even more great content for our users.</p>
If we fall short of our goal, the money will still go to developing the workout playlist capability, but it will not be as comprehensive as we described above.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<em><strong>Note:</strong></em> <em>If you currently have an Unlimited Annual membership and contribute to a level that provides membership perks. You will get a coupon code that we ask you to use when your current membership expires. So if you are an Annual Member and contribute $150, that means you have your second year paid for!</em>
</div>
<div><em> </em></div>
<div><em>You can expect physical awards relatively quickly after we complete fundraising. We estimate mid to late September 2013. </em></div>
<div><em> </em></div>
<div><em>The workout download will come from a new collection of videos, so we will have to produce it after fundraising and should be expected in October 2013. <br/></em></div>
<div><em> </em></div>
<div><em>Memberships will be provided in coupon form. We will send them just before launching the new updates so you can enjoy the very development you contributed to. We will have a better idea of the exact date of completion at the end of the fundrasing campaign and will keep you consistently updated.<br/></em></div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>Wristband</strong> (We are going to personalize the message for this campaign, but you get the idea):</div>

<div> </div>
<div><strong>T-Shirt:</strong></div>
<div>
<strong><br/></strong>There will be two t-shirt options, a basic-T and a baby-T for ladies who want a snug fit. We will choose a fabric that is workout friendly with a crewneck style. This gives you an idea of how the front will look. The back will have a yet TBD commemorative message. </div>

<p>BJ took the concept of fast, fun workouts that could be done at home (or in a hotel room when traveling), and then applied the type of thinking that's made companies like Apple and Netflix hugely popular with its customers. Plus, he made it so that folks of ANY fitness level could benefit.</p>

<p>Whether you're a complete beginner or a longtime fitness enthusiast who loves ""extreme"" workouts, StreamFIT has a solution for you. Lots of them, in fact. With a click of a button, StreamFIT workouts instantly appear on your desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphone—even on your big-screen TV. But that's just the beginning. Here are some of the highlights:</p>

<li>
<strong>StreamFIT workouts are SIMPLE!</strong> <span>You can choose your goal, target area, and type of equipment you have available, and easily search the StreamFIT database of more than 250 workouts for the one that you'd like to try.

</li>
<li>
<strong>StreamFIT workouts are AWESOME! </strong><span>If you haven't heard of ""metabolic resistance training,"" don't worry. Just think of it as your resistance training and cardio workout all rolled into one. You'll use the resistance training —done with just your body-weight or a pair of dumbbells, or any number of other easily accessible equipment options that StreamFIT recommends — to target every muscle in your body. But you'll do it at a pace that also gives you an incredible cardiovascular workout. This approach torches as many calories per minute as running at a 6-minute per mile pace on the treadmill, according to research from the University of Southern Maine. Plus, studies show that it revs up your metabolism for another 48 hours after you're done working out!</span>

<li>
<strong>StreamFIT workouts are NEVER boring!</strong> <span>Right now, there are more than 250 workouts on StreamFIT — and that number is growing every single month. You'll not only find workouts from BJ, but also from a number of world-class fitness experts that BJ handpicked himself. From total-body transformation plans such as the Body-Weight Bootcamp (no equipment needed!) and Metabolic Mayhem (just a pair of dumbbells!) to specialty workouts like the Pregnancy Workout, Kettlebell Kaos, and Fit-Over 40, you simply won't find more incredible workouts — or a more convenient way to get in shape — ANYWHERE!</span>

We have a couple more days to make this happen! Below is a sample of what it would look like.

 
We have new contribution awards for: $5, $19, $33, and $79. Check them out!
Short Summary
StreamFIT (SF) is a subscription-based service featuring streaming fitness videos on a web mobile platform at StreamFIT.com.

The company was originally launched in December 2011 by company founder and CEO BJ Gaddour, CSCS. SF currently offers over 250 world class workout videos with new content added monthly, making it the most comprehensive online fitness resource on the market today.

Users can choose between a free membership with four preselected ad-supported videos per month or an unlimited membership with ad-free access to the entire workout database.

BJ is an internationally recognized fitness expert and a member of the Training Advisory Board for Men's Health, the world's largest men's magazine. He is probably best known for the being the creator of Men's Health DeltaFit Speed Shred, the best-selling DVD series in the history of RODALE Publishing.

BJ is also listed as one of the ""100 Fittest Men of All-Time"" by Men's Health Magazine and one of the ""50 Hottest Trainers in America"" according to SHAPE Magazine.

We want to further improve our web mobile platform to create a more complete social fitness media experience that helps our members stay more consistent with their training routines.

Your funds will go towards creating each of the following unique features within our web mobile platform:
- Build your own streaming workout video playlists like you can build your own streaming music playlists with a service like Spotify. Whether you want to save your top 10 favorite videos or abs workouts or combine your favorite warmup, workout and cool-down, you'll be able to completely streamline your fitness experience. Playlists will also play automatically back-to-back. Instead of looking for a warmup, then searching for a workout, then a sizzler, you simply store your favorite combos in a playlist and press once!
- Share your workout video playlists with friends and family via social media to encourage others to get fit. Know a friend who travels a lot and wants to get back in shape? Share your hotel room workout playlist! The options are truly endless to inspire others to make a change. Also, you will be able to share playlists with other StreamFIT members within the website.
- Create your own training plans by week, month, or year with an integrated calendar/scheduling function. This will also allow you to track your compliance to see how consistent you've been with your workouts. You'll be able to share these with other members or on social media in addition to searching the ever-growing database for new training plans. The more members who share their training plans, the more training plans all StreamFITTERS will have to choose from!
- Film 50 more streaming workout videos featuring more equipment-free calorie-killing routines you can do anytime, anywhere. Plus, you'll be able to vote for which types of workouts you want us to film!
- A StreamFIT community where all members can get to know one another, share their favorite workout/nutrition tips, and just have a virtual hangout spot with other like-minded fitness lovers from all over the world!
With your help we'll be able to create the most complete online fitness experience the world has ever seen!
Think of how great it will be to store and share playlists of your favorite workouts and have a community of StreamFITTERS sharing training plans with each other!

What We Need & What You Get
We need $100,000 of total funding. Most of the money will go to development and testing for all of the aforementioned website features. Of course, a percentage will go to Indiegogo fees and rounding up the fabulous awards we've put together for you. Remaining funding will be used to produce even more great content for our users.
If we fall short of our goal, the money will still go to developing the workout playlist capability, but it will not be as comprehensive as we described above.
 

Note: If you currently have an Unlimited Annual membership and contribute to a level that provides membership perks. You will get a coupon code that we ask you to use when your current membership expires. So if you are an Annual Member and contribute $150, that means you have your second year paid for!

 
You can expect physical awards relatively quickly after we complete fundraising. We estimate mid to late September 2013. 
 
The workout download will come from a new collection of videos, so we will have to produce it after fundraising and should be expected in October 2013. 
 
Memberships will be provided in coupon form. We will send them just before launching the new updates so you can enjoy the very development you contributed to. We will have a better idea of the exact date of completion at the end of the fundrasing campaign and will keep you consistently updated.
 

Wristband (We are going to personalize the message for this campaign, but you get the idea):
 

 
 
By the way, this one says: ""My performance enhancing drug is a great workout."" Didn't want people getting the wrong idea with only a partial message visible ;)
 
T-Shirt:

There will be two t-shirt options, a basic-T and a baby-T for ladies who want a snug fit. We will choose a fabric that is workout friendly with a crewneck style. This gives you an idea of how the front will look. The back will have a yet TBD commemorative message. 
 

 

Why StreamFIT?

<h3>Who we are</h3>
We are a group of students and community members helping to raise funds in support of the Smiles International Foundation; an organization of volunteer medical professionals who treat under-priviledged children with cleft pallet and other crono-facial deformities for free.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>For this fundraiser we're supporting the part of the organization that travels to Tecate, Mexico three weekends a year to perform these surgeries.</div>
<div>
<h3>Covering Surgery Costs</h3>
<p>A standard cleft pallet surgery can easily cost over $4,000 in the United States. Thanks to Dr. Moses and his team donating their services and even covering personal travel, they've gotten the cost of a surgery down to as little as $250.</p>
<p>This means money donated will go directly into covering the cost of anestesia gas, drugs, and other supplies. Even the smallest donation can make a huge difference in funding these life-changing surgeries.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
If left untreated these children are not only inflicted with ridicule because of their facial appearance, but also can not eat, or speak well causing them to be unable to communicate, negatively affecting their personal, work, and school life.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A program like the Smiles of Tecate allows these children the opportunity to live a normal life and grow up to be happy and productive members of society.</div>

Condition



My condition is called Arteriovenous
Malformation (AVM) and it's extremely rare. I was saved by emergency surgery
but 50% of the people who have an AVM bleed are not so lucky. My condition
changed my entire outlook on life and I decided to give back to patients who
have rare conditions by becoming a Doctor. After finishing business school, I
enrolled at UT Austin to complete my medical school pre-requisites. This summer
I took the MCAT and applied to medical school. I'm now on the
interview trail, anxious to see where I'll be in the Fall.
While recovering from my AVM, I couldn't
find a single support group in the Chicago area so I turned to the Internet for
help. Unfortunately there were no Internet support groups for AVM patients
either! I finally found the support I was looking for by creating my own group
at AVMSurvivors.org. Other AVM patients found us and we grew into a
close-knit online family of AVM survivors.
In 2008 we started more patient communities and
Ben's Friends has been tripling in size every year since. Almost all of our
members tell us that they have never before spoken to anyone with their rare
disease in their entire lives! They are excited and comforted to find hundreds of people experiencing the
same emotions they are experiencing. They don't feel so alone anymore.



Donations
are Appreciated
We launched Ben's Friends as a social enterprise, to do good in the world while breaking even. Over 90 volunteer moderators (patients themselves) volunteer their time and none of us take any compensation for our efforts. We have also contributed over $20,000 of our own money
because we believe in the cause. The very few online health sites that serve patients with
rare diseases, including Ben's Friends, have a very difficult time generating

receive donations from friends and patients totaling over $15,000.
I'm writing to ask you for help in the form
of volunteer time and/or a financial donation. We could use help getting the
word out by leveraging your personal network. In addition, we would be
incredibly grateful if you would make a donation to our fundraiser.
Our monthly costs are approaching $2,000
and a $100 donation would fund one of our communities for 3 months. A $500
donation would allow us to start a brand new patient community for a rare disease population that usually has no other option. We constantly have patients
writing in to ask us to start a support group for them. We have a waiting list
of 100 support groups that we could start tomorrow if we had the funds. If one of
your loved ones has been touched by a rare condition, we would be happy to
start a community for that condition.
Thanks for reading my story and for the
support along the way. Ben's Friends is truly a little Internet miracle and we
want to keep it going.

<p><span style="""">After over 30 runs down Bobsled / Skeleton track in one week, Josh Safarik returned home from Lake Placid Saturday night with a big smile and even bigger bruises.   Some of the athletes Josh was training with did not fair so well and one guy in particular unfortunately broke his collar bone when he crashed hard on one of the last curves in the track.  Josh did not break any bones but he does have some grapefruit size bruises on both his shoulders and triceps.   Apparently if you hit the wall at any point during the run, the force of the impact bounces you over and slams you into the opposite wall too.   So I guess its always a two-for-one special.  Driving the skeleton sled sounds quite complex as Josh describes it despite how simple it looks on TV.  Because of the high speed, any little twitch of your muscles or a glance in the wrong direction with your head can steer the sled in an unwanted direction.  This means that the athletes have to remain loose rather than tense for certain parts of the run, which is hard to do at 60 mph with your face an inch off the ice.  It also means that sometimes you can't really even look to see where you are going so the athletes have to study and memorize the layout of the track and sequence of the curves over and over again in their head.  This doesn't sound that easy when there are 20 different turns in the track.  Despite these challenges, Josh and some of the other athletes graduated to the top of the track by Thursday of this past week and ran the entire length of the course many times before training ended on Saturday.  So all in all it was a great week for Josh and its great to have him home in one piece.   Watch for Zeph and Josh on Kiii TV tonight.  Bill Churchwell is doing a follow up story on them and their new adventures in Boblsed and Skeleton.</span></p>

<p><span style="""">With Zeph back home from Bobsled training, its now Josh's time to feel the adrenaline rush at Lake Placid Skeleton School.  Josh flew out of Corpus Christi Sunday and arrived at The Olympic Training Center very excited and a little nervous about the upcoming week.  There are ten athletes in the school, all of them new to Skeleton.   After some dry-land push training, the coaches threw them right in the fire (or I should say ice) on Monday with their first runs down the lower part of the track.  The coaches start them lower down so they don't get up to ludicrous speed on their very first run.  After his slide, Josh described his first expeirence via txt message; ""There is not a roller coaster in the world that can beat this.""   The althletes continued training today and have been progressing quickly, starting further and further up the track to get more and more speed.  So far Josh has 8 runs under his belt in just two days and with the good runs also come some hard knocks.   Its suprising to hear from both Josh and Zeph how violent these ice sliding sports are.   Josh said on one of his runs he took a hit so hard on turn ten that he wasn't sure his arm was still attached until he got to the bottom and hand a chance to check it.  Later that evening he described the lingering sensation on his shoulder as ""getting a tatoo on a sunburn"".   He also mentioned the G-forces in the corners are so strong that you struggle just to keep your face off the ice.  Despite the human pinball type injuries, Josh reports a fun level of 20 on a scale of 1 to 10 and you can hear the excitment in his voice when he talks about the experience.  He is pumped to learn as much as he can from the fantastic Olympic coaches and very determined to keep..... going .......faster.</span><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<div style=""font-weight: normal;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">After two weeks of training, the US National Team Bobsled Racing Trials took place Saturday morning in Lake Placid, New York.  Zeph and his driver Hunter Church very much wanted to compete Saturday however their vicious crash this past Thursday on a training run left Hunter with a concussion; the effects of which he really started to feel Saturday morning.  Unfortunately this meant the medical staff at the Lake Placid Olympic Training Center could not clear him to race Saturday.  So despite a gigantic effort and the best intentions from this daring duo, they had no choice but to bow out of the competition.   So after saying goodbye to the Coaches and athletes, Zeph jumped on a plane Saturday afternoon back home to Rockport Texas in good spirits, filled with optimism about his future in the sport of Bobsledding.</span></div>
<div style=""font-weight: normal;"">Zeph's journey to this point has been truly exceptional despite this last unfortunate turn of events.  I<span style="""">t was only this past July when Zeph first learned about bobsledding and as a possible path for his athletic talent, and now just three months later, he was about to compete for a spot on the US National team against seasoned athletes and Olympic champions.  His odds of making the US National Team so quickly where slim but just the fact that he was able to compete at this level is nothing short of extraordinary.  Imagine learning a new sport one day and three months later competing in that sport at the national level.  That just doesn't happen to regular folks.</span>
</div>
<div style=""font-weight: normal;""><span style="""">Now that the honeymoon is over, Zeph will come back home and begin training and preparing for his next chance at a spot on the National Team.  Armed with this experience and the Olympic coaching resources he has gained from these past two weeks, he will be infinitely more prepared to qualify for the US National Team the next time around.  Even though the event is a year away now, the first step in qualifying will be a skills combine in early spring, which isn't too far away.</span></div>

<div style=""font-weight: normal;"">After 3 days of bobsled training without incident, Zeph and his driver decided it was time to crash today.  I'm sure they didn't plan on crashing but apparently if you go down the track enough times as fast as possible, you will eventually crash.  So what does a crash at 60+ miles an hour in a bobsled feel like?  According to Zeph, ""The most vicious thing I've ever experienced.""  The bobsled flipped on turn 5 which meant there were still plenty more turns to go through, except that they would go through them upside down, sideways, wrongways, and every other way you don't want to be on a bobsled track.  Most car crashes are over in a couple of seconds.  This one went on for probably a full minute before they came to a stop.  Much like a car wreck, Zeph said the safest place to be in a crash is inside the bobsled but apparently it is extremely difficult to stay inside when you are getting slammed into the corners at mach speed.  He even broke the handle off the inside of the sled because he was pulling so hard on it to stay inside.  And if this isn't fun enough for you, then imagine that while all this is going on you can feel your skin getting hot from the friction of your protective suit rubbing against the ice track at 60 mph.  Apparently the suit doesn't tear but your skin still gets rubbed raw.  Yet despite all this Zeph is pumped to do it all again tomorrow.  He said he's glad he got his first crash over with and that he will take a couple of advil and go out again tomorrow as long as they can get the sled back in working order tonight.  That's ARMY tough for you folks.  Hoo-ah!</div>

<div>Zeph will have his first run down the Lake Placid Olympic track on the first day of ice training tomorrow.  He's teamed up with a young driver who is a senior in high school that has been driving bobsled since he was 12 years old.  Apparently he has logged over 100 runs down the Lake Placid track without any crashes.  The coaches described to Zeph how that first run will feel;  ""Like stuffing yourself into a garbage can and bouncing down a mountain"".  Zeph's been fitted with special shoes, a helmet and some kind of protective suit and can't wait to get his first run in the morning.  Up until this point, this whole experience has been new, exciting and fun but when he laid out his gear on his bed knowing he was going to be actually bobsledding tomorrow, his comment was ""This just got real"", in slightly more colorful terms.  He ain't scared.  Maybe just a wee bit.</div>

<p><span style="""">Here is Zeph pushing on the practice track today.  Yesterday the athletes did some more skill testing which included a sprint and a 1 rep max power clean but... the weights were all in Kilograms.  Since he wasn't exactly sure what his max lift was in kg, he just kept lifting and adding more weight on in true Zeph fashion.  Eventually the coach told him to stop because he had scored 100 out of a possible 100pts for the skill.  Only then did he realize he had power cleaned 150kg (330lbs).  A new personal record for him by 15lbs.  It is also 1.75 times his body weight.</span></p>

<p>Zeph flew out of Corpus Christi yesterday and arrived at the Lake Placid, New York Olympic Training Facility last night.  He was excited and a little nervous but said everyone there was really nice.  This morning the athletes will be divided into groups and begin their training on pushing the bobsled.  Zeph will be there for one week, possibly two, then back home for a week.  Then he and Josh will head back to Lake Placid together for the Skeleton training.  Thanks again for all the support and contributions in the last few days!</p>

<h3>***UPDATE**  Oct 6th.</h3>
<div>Zeph got a call from USA Bobsled and they invited him to the US National Team Bobsled ""Push Championships"" .  This means he now has a shot to tryout for both Bobsled (Oct 12-19) and Skeleton (Nov 2-8).  We are still getting the details but any contributions over the $2700 goal will certainly be appreciated to get Zeph to this event as well.  Your support has been incredible.  Thanks so much!</div>

After over 30 runs down Bobsled / Skeleton track in one week, Josh Safarik returned home from Lake Placid Saturday night with a big smile and even bigger bruises.   Some of the athletes Josh was training with did not fair so well and one guy in particular unfortunately broke his collar bone when he crashed hard on one of the last curves in the track.  Josh did not break any bones but he does have some grapefruit size bruises on both his shoulders and triceps.   Apparently if you hit the wall at any point during the run, the force of the impact bounces you over and slams you into the opposite wall too.   So I guess its always a two-for-one special.  Driving the skeleton sled sounds quite complex as Josh describes it despite how simple it looks on TV.  Because of the high speed, any little twitch of your muscles or a glance in the wrong direction with your head can steer the sled in an unwanted direction.  This means that the athletes have to remain loose rather than tense for certain parts of the run, which is hard to do at 60 mph with your face an inch off the ice.  It also means that sometimes you can't really even look to see where you are going so the athletes have to study and memorize the layout of the track and sequence of the curves over and over again in their head.  This doesn't sound that easy when there are 20 different turns in the track.  Despite these challenges, Josh and some of the other athletes graduated to the top of the track by Thursday of this past week and ran the entire length of the course many times before training ended on Saturday.  So all in all it was a great week for Josh and its great to have him home in one piece.   Watch for Zeph and Josh on Kiii TV tonight.  Bill Churchwell is doing a follow up story on them and their new adventures in Boblsed and Skeleton.

With Zeph back home from Bobsled training, its now Josh's time to feel the adrenaline rush at Lake Placid Skeleton School.  Josh flew out of Corpus Christi Sunday and arrived at The Olympic Training Center very excited and a little nervous about the upcoming week.  There are ten athletes in the school, all of them new to Skeleton.   After some dry-land push training, the coaches threw them right in the fire (or I should say ice) on Monday with their first runs down the lower part of the track.  The coaches start them lower down so they don't get up to ludicrous speed on their very first run.  After his slide, Josh described his first expeirence via txt message; ""There is not a roller coaster in the world that can beat this.""   The althletes continued training today and have been progressing quickly, starting further and further up the track to get more and more speed.  So far Josh has 8 runs under his belt in just two days and with the good runs also come some hard knocks.   Its suprising to hear from both Josh and Zeph how violent these ice sliding sports are.   Josh said on one of his runs he took a hit so hard on turn ten that he wasn't sure his arm was still attached until he got to the bottom and hand a chance to check it.  Later that evening he described the lingering sensation on his shoulder as ""getting a tatoo on a sunburn"".   He also mentioned the G-forces in the corners are so strong that you struggle just to keep your face off the ice.  Despite the human pinball type injuries, Josh reports a fun level of 20 on a scale of 1 to 10 and you can hear the excitment in his voice when he talks about the experience.  He is pumped to learn as much as he can from the fantastic Olympic coaches and very determined to keep..... going .......faster.

***UPDATE***  Oct 26th


After two weeks of training, the US National Team Bobsled Racing Trials took place Saturday morning in Lake Placid, New York.  Zeph and his driver Hunter Church very much wanted to compete Saturday however their vicious crash this past Thursday on a training run left Hunter with a concussion; the effects of which he really started to feel Saturday morning.  Unfortunately this meant the medical staff at the Lake Placid Olympic Training Center could not clear him to race Saturday.  So despite a gigantic effort and the best intentions from this daring duo, they had no choice but to bow out of the competition.   So after saying goodbye to the Coaches and athletes, Zeph jumped on a plane Saturday afternoon back home to Rockport Texas in good spirits, filled with optimism about his future in the sport of Bobsledding.
Zeph's journey to this point has been truly exceptional despite this last unfortunate turn of events.  It was only this past July when Zeph first learned about bobsledding and as a possible path for his athletic talent, and now just three months later, he was about to compete for a spot on the US National team against seasoned athletes and Olympic champions.  His odds of making the US National Team so quickly where slim but just the fact that he was able to compete at this level is nothing short of extraordinary.  Imagine learning a new sport one day and three months later competing in that sport at the national level.  That just doesn't happen to regular folks.

Now that the honeymoon is over, Zeph will come back home and begin training and preparing for his next chance at a spot on the National Team.  Armed with this experience and the Olympic coaching resources he has gained from these past two weeks, he will be infinitely more prepared to qualify for the US National Team the next time around.  Even though the event is a year away now, the first step in qualifying will be a skills combine in early spring, which isn't too far away.

***UPDATE***  Oct 23rd

Check out this video link before you read anymore of this post.     Its worth it.

http://youtu.be/1ig4JLAgTJ0

After 3 days of bobsled training without incident, Zeph and his driver decided it was time to crash today.  I'm sure they didn't plan on crashing but apparently if you go down the track enough times as fast as possible, you will eventually crash.  So what does a crash at 60+ miles an hour in a bobsled feel like?  According to Zeph, ""The most vicious thing I've ever experienced.""  The bobsled flipped on turn 5 which meant there were still plenty more turns to go through, except that they would go through them upside down, sideways, wrongways, and every other way you don't want to be on a bobsled track.  Most car crashes are over in a couple of seconds.  This one went on for probably a full minute before they came to a stop.  Much like a car wreck, Zeph said the safest place to be in a crash is inside the bobsled but apparently it is extremely difficult to stay inside when you are getting slammed into the corners at mach speed.  He even broke the handle off the inside of the sled because he was pulling so hard on it to stay inside.  And if this isn't fun enough for you, then imagine that while all this is going on you can feel your skin getting hot from the friction of your protective suit rubbing against the ice track at 60 mph.  Apparently the suit doesn't tear but your skin still gets rubbed raw.  Yet despite all this Zeph is pumped to do it all again tomorrow.  He said he's glad he got his first crash over with and that he will take a couple of advil and go out again tomorrow as long as they can get the sled back in working order tonight.  That's ARMY tough for you folks.  Hoo-ah!






***UPDATE***  Oct 19th
Zeph will have his first run down the Lake Placid Olympic track on the first day of ice training tomorrow.  He's teamed up with a young driver who is a senior in high school that has been driving bobsled since he was 12 years old.  Apparently he has logged over 100 runs down the Lake Placid track without any crashes.  The coaches described to Zeph how that first run will feel;  ""Like stuffing yourself into a garbage can and bouncing down a mountain"".  Zeph's been fitted with special shoes, a helmet and some kind of protective suit and can't wait to get his first run in the morning.  Up until this point, this whole experience has been new, exciting and fun but when he laid out his gear on his bed knowing he was going to be actually bobsledding tomorrow, his comment was ""This just got real"", in slightly more colorful terms.  He ain't scared.  Maybe just a wee bit.








***UPDATE***  Oct 15th

Here is Zeph pushing on the practice track today.  Yesterday the athletes did some more skill testing which included a sprint and a 1 rep max power clean but... the weights were all in Kilograms.  Since he wasn't exactly sure what his max lift was in kg, he just kept lifting and adding more weight on in true Zeph fashion.  Eventually the coach told him to stop because he had scored 100 out of a possible 100pts for the skill.  Only then did he realize he had power cleaned 150kg (330lbs).  A new personal record for him by 15lbs.  It is also 1.75 times his body weight.


***UPDATE***  Oct 13th
Zeph flew out of Corpus Christi yesterday and arrived at the Lake Placid, New York Olympic Training Facility last night.  He was excited and a little nervous but said everyone there was really nice.  This morning the athletes will be divided into groups and begin their training on pushing the bobsled.  Zeph will be there for one week, possibly two, then back home for a week.  Then he and Josh will head back to Lake Placid together for the Skeleton training.  Thanks again for all the support and contributions in the last few days!




***UPDATE***  Oct 9th
Wow!  $3345 contributed in 4 days!  Your support and excitement for Josh and Zeph is nothing short of amazing.  For those who are wondering, we started this campaign before we knew Zeph was also going to get invited to the National Team Bobsled tryouts so....although we've surpassed our initial $2700 goal, your continued contributions will go a long way in getting him through the Bobsled event.  About 35% of the money contributed will be used to purchase all the sweet perks y'all have ordered so you can expect to get an email soon confirming your shirt sizes and shipping info.  
Both Zeph and Josh put in a hard workout today.  Zeph was also trying on cold weather sprinting tights this afternoon :)  (Its pretty chilly up there in New York)  He leaves for the National Bobsled Push Championships on Sunday.

***UPDATE**  Oct 6th.
Zeph got a call from USA Bobsled and they invited him to the US National Team Bobsled ""Push Championships"" .  This means he now has a shot to tryout for both Bobsled (Oct 12-19) and Skeleton (Nov 2-8).  We are still getting the details but any contributions over the $2700 goal will certainly be appreciated to get Zeph to this event as well.  Your support has been incredible.  Thanks so much!

They are doing what???! Zeph Littleton and Josh Safarik have been friends since high school and they are also both Coaches at the local CrossfitXLR8  gym in Portland, TX.   When they discovered that the Olympic Regional Development Authority was looking all over the country for athletes to develop into Olympic Bobsled and Skeleton champions, they jumped at the chance to attend a recruiting combine in Dallas this past July.  The combine consisted of three events; a 60m sprint, standing broad jump and a underhand shot toss.  Zeph and Josh both scored extremely well at the event.  They just recently received the exciting news that they have been invited to a 7 day Skeleton school in Lake Placid, New York (site of the 1980 Winter Olympics) by the Olympic Regional Development Authority!  Check out the ""Gallery"" tab at the top of the page to see quick videos of what Bobsled and Skeleton are all about.   What They Need  To get to the event this November at Lake Placid, New York, they could certainly use some help with 
Airfare to Albany, New York- $450 each Ground Transportation - Albany to Lake Placid return - $100 each 
Accommodations & Meals - $775 each 

  What You Get
All contributors will receive a real snowball from the Adirondack Mountains as well as .....

Any of the PERKS below for your contribution amount (shown on right).











Once we receive your contribution, we will contact you by email to confirm the size you would like.

The Impact of your Contribution The road to the Olympics is long and tough to say the least.  It takes almost unimaginable determination and resilience as well as the emotional and financial support of family, friends and community.   Zeph and Josh had the guts to take that first step to realize an almost impossible dream ; a South Texas Bobsled TEAM!!  We all know its a long shot, but as hockey legend Wayne Gretzky once said, ""You miss 100 percent of the shots you don't take"".  Help them take this shot.  With a little luck and a ton of hard work, we just might see these two South Texans on the world stage one day going 85 miles an hour down a brain bending ice track.  Yeeehaw!!

Like other communities in Appalachia it's history is riddled in stories of mining families, mutual aid, and an unwavering sense of place. This proud history lives on as Beards Fork is home to the Southern Appalachian Labor School (SALS). SALS works on vital projects such as the robust after school program, Energy Express, and Youthbuild programs that train local youth in trades, while building affordable housing throughout Fayette County. Over the decades their community programs have supported union miners fighting for Black Lung benefits, leading all the way up to today supporting union miners’ fight for fairness raging currently between Patriot Coal and their pensioners.</span></p>

The industry around Loop Creek  includes surface mining, to which recent studies have shown a correlative link between with  serious health problems.

</div></div>","Beards Fork is situated in the Loop Creek watershed in the  heart of central Appalachia, and smack dab in the middle of the billion dollar coal fields. Like other communities in Appalachia it's history is riddled in stories of mining families, mutual aid, and an unwavering sense of place. This proud history lives on as Beards Fork is home to the Southern Appalachian Labor School (SALS). SALS works on vital projects such as the robust after school program, Energy Express, and Youthbuild programs that train local youth in trades, while building affordable housing throughout Fayette County. Over the decades their community programs have supported union miners fighting for Black Lung benefits, leading all the way up to today supporting union miners’ fight for fairness raging currently between Patriot Coal and their pensioners.
All of this community building has happened while being in the middle of a region that has a lot of questions that need to be answered about public health. Beards Fork is in the heart of the diabetes belt, appears to have high levels of various respiratory illnesses such as: Asthma, COPD, and black lung, and through personal accounts of community members- high rates of cancer.
To date, there has been a cloudy understanding of the health problems faced by the people of Beards Fork and their causes. Beards Fork  has many indicators of heightened health risks, with a high poverty rate, food insecurity, contaminated water, air pollution, workplace hazards, and a high rate of industry in the area. The industry around Loop Creek  includes surface mining, to which recent studies have shown a correlative link between with  serious health problems. Local residents of Beards Fork have begun to question the state of public health within their  watershed, and are working together to build community knowledge about their health.
To  address these issues, residents of Beards Fork and the surrounding communities have decided to create a robust and participatory health survey. This survey will connect community members, volunteers, and experts in public health and epidemiology to engage  the community in an effort to learn more about their public health, and give the information needed to make community decisions about the conditions that determine their health. 
What We Need & What You Get
We are looking to raise 2,700 dollars. Your donation will go to the following.
. 500.00 Donation to the Southern Appalachian Labor School for housing, access to their office and resources. 
. 1000.00 Stipend for Project Coordinator Dustin Steele who is working full time with the Coalfield Environmental Health Project this summer to make this survey a reality. 
. 200.00 For travel costs for volunteers and trainers.
. 250.00 For food and other expenses during the kick off event and three volunteer days.
. 500.00 Stipend for the Community Coordinator from Beards Fork.  
The Impact
We believe that knowledge is a cornerstone of building power and strengthening communities. This survey will be shaped by the community; they'll help write and administer the survey. Residents will be able to have a common knowledge of the health of their community.  We believe that knowlede of community health can  be the foundations of further action to improve the health of Beards Fork and the surrounding communities.
 The methods of this survey are created with the intention of it being replicable, so that other folks in Appalachia can pick up the tools we used to gauge public health in their own communities.  
Finally, and most importantly knowledge of the health of one’s community should be a right to all. Only  through working together can we actualize healthier communities. This information is not only vital to explore if there are clusters of serious illnesses within the Loop Creek watershed, but to create a foundation that continues in the proud Appalachian tradition of neighbor helping neighbor.
Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help:

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My wonderful loving husband and father to 3 children passed away on March 7, losing his battle with cancer of the esophagus. Steve had his esophagus removed on February 7th and spent a total of 28 days in the hospital with 26 of those in ICU at UT Southwestern/St Paul in Dallas, TX.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> I have been unemployed since August of 2011, a month after we found out he had cancer. Me not working was a blessing in disguise as it allowed me to be by my husband's side in this final journey he took. We were not financially prepared for this so we are trying to raise some money to assist with the funeral cost. I realize going through this I am in the wrong field, to just cremate someone it is $3000.00!</p>

<p>We offer a nutrient dense snack, made of organic non-GMO ingredients in their whole form, that balances carbohydrates, proteins, and quality fats.

<p><strong>WHAT WE DO</strong></p>
<p>Imagine being 32 years old, having 34 surgeries in 9 months, having both legs amputated above the knees, missing fingers, and severe damage to your hands and forearms.</p>
<p>Imagine if these injuries were your daily struggle- all day, every day, for the rest of your life. What would you miss? What would you do to have the chance to do what you used to take for granted? What would you do to feel the wind again, catch a fish or even participate in some water sports- the chance to do what ordinary people do.  Sergeant First Class Aaron Causey (please view the video included) is one of 1600 multiple amputee veterans the BLUE WATER WARRIORS Foundation is trying to help through innovative rehabilitation programs away from the daily grind of military hospitals</p>
<p> <strong>WHAT WE NEED</strong></p>
<p>We are trying to raise ($10,000+) in order to purchase medical and safety equipment to fit out our custom built vessels. The vessels are custom built for the purpose of making the water accessible to those in wheelchairs or on prosthetic limbs and their families. The programs we offer are for all injured veterans to assist in their rehabilitation.  We take injured veterans and their families out on the water to feel the wind again, catch a fish, or spot a whale.  Your donation, however small, can go towards providing revolutionary means to achieve rehabilitation and reclaim lost capabilities.  Your assistance helps us to help those who have given so much in defense of our country and our way of life. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>HOW YOU CAN HELP</strong></p>
<p>When a 28 year old triple amputee veteran asked us if we could take him, his wife and daughter fishing how could we say no.  How could we say no to someone who has given everything but his life for us and his country?  How can we not assist those whose lives are forever changed for doing what they believe in?  We believe we have to help and give back to those who have given so much.  To see the smile on the face of not only our veterans, but also their families, as they do something they thought they would never do again is priceless. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Every donation, however small goes directly to the veterans, like Aaron, to assist in their rehabilitation and improves the quality of their lives. </p>
<p> <strong>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</strong></p>
<p>Not everyone can donate and those who can’t may help us spread the word about our efforts and bring potential contributors to our campaign.  Please use the share tools on the Indiegogo site also.</p>

<h2><strong> </strong></h2>
<h2><strong>The Kale Tea Project is Driven by 3 Objectives:</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Objective No. 1 - DRINK MORE KALE!</strong></h3>
<p><span>Kale is the hottest superfood on the planet. We won’t bore you with all the data and details. We intend to bottle up all those nutrients &amp; antioxidants in a super tasty Ready to Drink (RTD) beverage and put it on store shelves everywhere!</span></p>
<p><span>But, for that to happen, we need to raise $10,000 to fund our first bottling production run. We are confident that once Kale Tea™ gets into the hands of you, the consumer, the rest will fall into place. Join the Rooftop Revolution and back our project!</span></p>
<h3><span><strong>Objective No. 2 - Provide a healthy alternative to Sugary drinks.</strong></span></h3>
<p><span>We believe that sometimes less is more. What would you prefer, Kale, mint and water...or 12 teaspoons of sugar and a laundry list of chemicals that you can’t pronounce? Think before you drink. </span></p>
<p><span>Skeptics might think Kale Tea™ can’t possibly be healthy and taste good. Well, we did a taste test with the toughest focus group there is...kids. Guess what? They gave it their thumbs up. Now that’s Sweet!</span></p>
<p><span>Just in case you were wondering if we are a one trick pony...right now we have 3 different flavors ready to go. And we are constantly holding mixology sessions to come up with more. And did I mention that we we have collaborated with James Beard award winning Chef Alan Wong? Chef Alan loves Kale Tea™ and is currently tapping his creative juices to create an incredibly delicious world class Kale Tea™ flavor that is worthy of his Signature. Uh, yea...it's going to rock!</span></p>
<h3><span><strong>Objective No. 3 - Establish Rooftop Farms in Cities across the Country &amp; across the World!</strong></span></h3>
<p><span>Cities occupy just 2% of the earth, yet they consume 75% of its resources. Looking down from space you would see that 1/3 of our cities are flat roofs, which are doing nothing but reflecting heat, looking ugly, and taking up space.</span></p>
<p><span>Our BIG food system just loves our densely populated cities, aka; ""food deserts"" because they can pack trains, planes and automobiles full of food (or what they call food) and make huge profits. The System calls this ""Centralization"". We call it ""Unsustainable"".</span></p>
<p><span>So, what can we do to change the System? How about transforming some of those wasted rooftops into thriving organic farms that feed the very people that live in its shadow?  Those same rooftop farms can provide children with hands-on learning experiences, train the next generation of ""Green Collar"" entrepreneurs, and support local food economies. Great idea, but who's going to pay for them you ask? WE are. WE, as in you, me, and all the drinkers of Kale Tea™.</span></p>
<p><span>Yup, Crowd-sourcing rooftop farms...that’s our plan. Let me explain. 10 cents from every bottle of Kale Tea™ sold will be donated to the FarmRoof® Foundation, which in turn will donate rooftop farms to schools, non-profits, and other deserving organizations across the country and across the world.</span></p>

<h3><span><em>AFTER - Organic Farm (let thy food be thy medicine)</em></span></h3>
<h3><span> </span></h3>
<h2><span>Rooftop Farms? That’s Crazy!</span></h2>
<p><span>You're probably thinking to yourself, putting dirt on roofs is asking for trouble, it’s too heavy, the roof is going to leak, it’s Pie-In-The-Sky thinking, right??? Well, we just so happened to have invented the FarmRoof®, the World's first and only certified organic food producing green roof system.  And, we operate more rooftop farms than anyone else in the World (none of which have a leaky roof). So...we kinda know what we are talking about.</span></p>
<p><span>Take my word for it, Rooftop Farming WILL flourish in our cities, but it's going to take WE the people to make it happen. Let's Do This!</span></p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Since we are launching a new ready to drink (RTD) bottled tea, the small kitchen brews just won't cut it any more. Luckily we have an awesome micro-brewery that is supporting our mission and totally on board and ready to help. However, because we are using high quality organic ingredients and a sleek glass bottle, we need to have minimum bottling runs in order to get all the costs down so that we can make this an affordable beverage. Reaching our $10,000 funding goal will allow us to economically produce our first flavor of Kale Tea™. The more we raise, the more we can brew.</p>
<p>While we don't expect to replace soda entirely (O.K., I admit it, I occasionally enjoy an ice cold soda), we do dream of making a splash in the beverage world. Being a small family business with limited funds, we are going to need a lot of supporters just like you to bring our dream to fruition. We want to touch as many people's lives as we can and promote healthy lifestyles and rooftop agriculture in cities across the Country and across the World. We want Kale Tea™ to be available in stores everywhere. With your support, we can Change the System! So please, spread the word and pass this link along to your family, friends, and co-workers.</p>
<p>Together, we can reshape the Beverage Industry and Make History! Aloha! </p>

Skeptics might think Kale Tea™ can’t possibly be healthy and taste good. Well, we did a taste test with the toughest focus group there is...kids. Guess what? They gave it their thumbs up. Now that’s Sweet!
Just in case you were wondering if we are a one trick pony...right now we have 3 different flavors ready to go. And we are constantly holding mixology sessions to come up with more. And did I mention that we we have collaborated with James Beard award winning Chef Alan Wong? Chef Alan loves Kale Tea™ and is currently tapping his creative juices to create an incredibly delicious world class Kale Tea™ flavor that is worthy of his Signature. Uh, yea...it's going to rock!
Objective No. 3 - Establish Rooftop Farms in Cities across the Country & across the World!
Cities occupy just 2% of the earth, yet they consume 75% of its resources. Looking down from space you would see that 1/3 of our cities are flat roofs, which are doing nothing but reflecting heat, looking ugly, and taking up space.
Our BIG food system just loves our densely populated cities, aka; ""food deserts"" because they can pack trains, planes and automobiles full of food (or what they call food) and make huge profits. The System calls this ""Centralization"". We call it ""Unsustainable"".
So, what can we do to change the System? How about transforming some of those wasted rooftops into thriving organic farms that feed the very people that live in its shadow?  Those same rooftop farms can provide children with hands-on learning experiences, train the next generation of ""Green Collar"" entrepreneurs, and support local food economies. Great idea, but who's going to pay for them you ask? WE are. WE, as in you, me, and all the drinkers of Kale Tea™.
Yup, Crowd-sourcing rooftop farms...that’s our plan. Let me explain. 10 cents from every bottle of Kale Tea™ sold will be donated to the FarmRoof® Foundation, which in turn will donate rooftop farms to schools, non-profits, and other deserving organizations across the country and across the world.
 
BEFORE - Wasted Roof Space at Castle Medical Center
 

AFTER - Organic Farm (let thy food be thy medicine)
 
Rooftop Farms? That’s Crazy!
You're probably thinking to yourself, putting dirt on roofs is asking for trouble, it’s too heavy, the roof is going to leak, it’s Pie-In-The-Sky thinking, right??? Well, we just so happened to have invented the FarmRoof®, the World's first and only certified organic food producing green roof system.  And, we operate more rooftop farms than anyone else in the World (none of which have a leaky roof). So...we kinda know what we are talking about.
Take my word for it, Rooftop Farming WILL flourish in our cities, but it's going to take WE the people to make it happen. Let's Do This!

Risks & Challenges
Since we are launching a new ready to drink (RTD) bottled tea, the small kitchen brews just won't cut it any more. Luckily we have an awesome micro-brewery that is supporting our mission and totally on board and ready to help. However, because we are using high quality organic ingredients and a sleek glass bottle, we need to have minimum bottling runs in order to get all the costs down so that we can make this an affordable beverage. Reaching our $10,000 funding goal will allow us to economically produce our first flavor of Kale Tea™. The more we raise, the more we can brew.
While we don't expect to replace soda entirely (O.K., I admit it, I occasionally enjoy an ice cold soda), we do dream of making a splash in the beverage world. Being a small family business with limited funds, we are going to need a lot of supporters just like you to bring our dream to fruition. We want to touch as many people's lives as we can and promote healthy lifestyles and rooftop agriculture in cities across the Country and across the World. We want Kale Tea™ to be available in stores everywhere. With your support, we can Change the System! So please, spread the word and pass this link along to your family, friends, and co-workers.
Together, we can reshape the Beverage Industry and Make History! Aloha!",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>When I was born, the doctors thought I was blind. After a little debating they determined that I did have sight, just not a significant amount. So, at the age of 2, I started wearing glasses. They were a definite help, but not enough. I still ran into things and got hurt on numerous occasions because I just couldnt see well enough.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Doctors told my dad, that there were certanties that we would have to deal with in regards to my life, and how it would be lived. I would not be able to play sports when the time came. I shouldn't be allowed to ride a bike by myself, because I was likely to get hit by a car or just run into things. The biggest and most dissapointing thing though, was that I would never be allowed to drive. Or even attempt to. Even if I wanted to, my eyes would not allow me the safety required to get around.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All of these things didn't seem like big deals at the time. However, I got older, and I wanted to play sports, but wasn't able to. That is until I found wrestling. Wrestling was the one sport that I could feel my way through. I did well when I got the opportunity during gym class. My dad eventually broke down and got me my own bike, and that was probably the happiest moment of my childhood. Being able to ride around the block with my friends and jump off of ramps was the best ever back then. The only time I ever got hurt was when I tried to do something new. Young boys are daredevils and I was no exception.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The one thing that has always escaped me was the ability to drive. I knew that no matter how much I wanted to, and no matter how much I practiced, I just would not be safe on the road. Not for myself, but for everyone else. Everyone has heard the phrase ""stay off the sidewalks"" whenever a friend or young relative gets their license. That is how everyone would feel were I to have gotten mine.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It seemed like there may be no hope for me, and I would always have to rely on other people in order to do some of the most basic things. For the most part I have always been pretty self reliant. With work, I have always lived in an area where I could just walk to work. Or to the store, or bank. However, when I got married, we moved out of town to be closer to her grandparents, who help out with our child. Now, I live so far away from everything, that walking is no longer an option. For the first time in my life, driving has become a necessity. I finally found a doctor who was proficient enough in the surgery I needed for me to take the risk. So, on August 13th, 2012, I will be getting surgery on my eyes in hopes that I will have vision enough to drive. The ultimate goal is to get my eyes to 20/40 or better. This will net me a whole new outlook on life. Not just driving. I will see things i have never seen before.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The insurance that my wife and I have is great.  However, there are certain aspects to the surgery that they will not pay for. This leaves us with a little added cost that we won't be able to cover alone.</p>
<ul>
<li>$1750 is the total cost of the lenses they are going to surgically place in my eyes. This is the most important part of my surgery. Without these lenses, the surgery does not happen.</li>
<li>$295 is the deductable. This has to be paid before the insurance company will write a check to the doctor</li>
<li>$750 is for miscellaneous. Because of the multiple appointents that have to happens before, during, and after the surgery, my wife will end up missing an entire week or more of work. This would not be so bad if the appointments were right in town, or even remotely close. The problem is that the appointments (6 so far) are 2 hours away. So this portion will help go towards gas, and a hotel room for two nights. Because the surgery is on the eye, they will need to have a 24hr post op check-up. So rather than waste gas on 8 hours of driving, we will most likely stay the night.</li>
<li>$200 will go to fees that are related to this site and paypal..</li>
</ul><p>I don't want people to think that I am taking advantage of them in any way, so I have decided that any excess money will be put back into this program. For those who donate (and I thank you sincerely) anything over $250, will get to help choose what project(s) the excess money will go toward.</p>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact is hard to explain. Imagine not being able to see raindrops when its pouring outside. Not being able to see an airplane flying just over your head. Imagine not being able to see your wife, husband, child until they are right up on you. Not being able to go to the movies because you can't really see the screen no matter how close you are. Or people looking at you funny because your face is literally buried in a book because that is the only way you can read it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now imagine that is your life. That is how you are and nothing is going to change that. Then... something does. Someone comes aloong and says ""I can fix that for you. I can give you the ability to read a book, see raindrops and airplanes. Go the movies with your family. I can change all of this for you.""  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The impact this will have on my life is invaluable and indescribable.  It is an unbelievable feeling to know that for the first time in my entire life, I might be able to live completely free.</p>

He was a beautiful 8lb 12oz baby and we had no idea that anything was wrong. One of the wonderful nurses discovered a heart murmur that changed our lives. He was so healthy and strong that we all thought his murmur was not serious but they called a cardiologist to come in to be sure. He discovered Oliver had a serious congenital heart defect and we had to move over to Egleston immediately.</p><p>Oliver had several issues with his heart but the main diagnosis was an IAA (interrupted aortic arch). The aorta, which carries oxygenated blood from the heart to the body, was not fully formed. This normally prevents any blood flow from circulating to the body and lower extremities but Oliver had two other defects that kept his blood flowing and masked that he was even having any trouble. He also had a PDA (patent ductus arteriosus). This is a connection between the pulmonary artery (the vessel that brings deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs) and the aorta which allows blood flow to bipass the lungs during fetal circulation. Usually, this closes very quickly after birth but with Oliver, it stayed open. This connection allowed some of the blood to flow from the pulmonary artery to the lower part of the aortic arch, bringing blood to the body. The third defect is a VSD (ventricular septal defect) which is a hole between the ventricles. This defect allowed the oxygenated and deoxygenated blood to mix in the heart. Instead of deoxygenated blood being carried through the pulmonary artery, mixed blood flowed through and brought oxygen to his body. Although he was stable before his surgery, his condition would have changed very quickly if the PDA closed. We are so thankful that it was discovered early.</p><p>Oliver was given a medication to keep his PDA open and that bought us time at Egleston to plan Oliver's surgery. After many tests, the surgical team decided they would have to do a stepped approach to Oliver's repair rather than one surgery to fix his heart. Due to the changes in his blood flow, parts of his heart and vessels did not develop as large as they normally would and he would need multiple surgeries and time to grow in between.</p><p>At one week old, Oliver had his first open heart surgery. Dr. Kanter went in to repair the arch and preformed a procedure called the Norwood. This is usually done on babies with only one ventricle which allows mixed blood (oxygenated and deoxygenated) to flow throughout the body. They left the VSD allowing his blood to mix and used his PDA to aid in rebuilding the arch as well his pulmonary artery. Finally, they placed a shunt (artificial vessel) to act as the pulmonary artery and take blood to the lungs. This temporary repair allowed Oliver to grow but the shunt was small and would need replacing in 6-9 months. The surgery was very complex and took almost 12 hours to complete but Dr. Kanter made sure the repair was perfect.</p><p>We were able to see Oliver after surgery and at that time it well past midnight. His chest was open due to swelling and he had many chest tubes and lines coming out of him. I couldn't even recognize him laying there. It was such a horrible sight. He was still on the breathing tube and sedated so we went home to rest after our long day.</p><p>The next morning I arrived early and was there until mid afternoon. I hadn't really slept and the nurse urged me to go home and get some sleep. Oliver was doing well and the critical 12 hour period after surgery had passed. I finally gave in, feeling exhausted. Shortly after I left his heart stopped. I had barely been home when we got the call. They were not able to get his heart functioning but they were able to put him on ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) which is a heart lung bypass machine. This machine does the work of Oliver's lungs and heart while allowing his heart time to recover. I am so thankful that ECMO exisits but it is not something you ever want to need. When we arrived back at Egleston, there were more connections coming out of his chest, carrying the blood out of his body to ECMO and back in again. Five days passed and the doctors felt they could try to take him off. We were warned before that if it was not successful now, he would not likely survive but he was strong and regained function of his heart.</p><p>After a couple days and a chest closure later, it was time to try to get him off his vent and get him breathing on his own. Each time we extubated him from the vent he had respiratory distress and collapse of his left lung. After several days of trying different things, the doctors discovered his left diaphragm was moving in the opposite direction than it should. Instead moving down and helping the lung open when Oliver took a breath, it pushed up and, along with some fluid in the lung, caused it to keep collapsing.</p><p>The solution to this was to have another surgery. They did what was called a diaphragm plication. This is where they go in through the ribs and tie the diaphragm down in the open position preventing it from pushing against the lung. He did well with this surgery and we were finally able to get him off the breathing tube.</p><p>The next hurdle to get over was feeding. We started feeding Oliver tiny amounts through a feeding tube that ran through his nose. He was not able to tolerate even the smallest amounts of food and we discovered he had severe acid reflux. Now we were facing yet another surgery. This time, Oliver had a fundoplication and a g-tube placed. A fundoplication is where the surgeon wraps part of the stomach around the base of the esophagus and the upper part of the stomach allowing food to go in but preventing anything from coming out. This kept the reflux from traveling up his esophagus and causing him to throw up. The g-tube is a tube placed into the stomach through the wall of the abdomen. This is where his feeding primarily took place but with the help of time and feeding therapy, the doctors were confident that he would be able to have the g-tube removed.</p><p>We were finally able to feed him with the help of the tube and we were increasing feedings gradually to his reach his goal. Again, he was breathing on his own after being on the vent again for the third surgery. We were hoping to get him out of the ICU when he developed an arrythmia that could be life threatening. He still had an external pacemaker thankfully and they were able to control it while they tested different antiarrythmia medications to treat it. Many of these drugs could cause harmful side effects so finding a balance was a delicate and time consuming project.</p><p>After some time, arrythmia controlled, we were transferred to the cardiac step-down unit where we learned more about how to care for Oliver at home. He had a dizzying 13 medications to be administered throughout the day and he was getting his feedings through a pump into his tube. There was a lot to learn in just a couple short days. It was seven weeks to the day and we were finally discharged home.</p><p>Almost two months late, we brought our baby home from the hospital. After an adjustment period, we developed a routine. We juggled many appointments with the cardiologist, feeding therapist, physical therapist, pulmonologist, gasteroenterologist, and pediatrician. It was hard at first but we were all so relieved to be together as a family again. Even Lewis adored his baby brother dispite him getting much of the attention.</p><p>Over the last six months, Oliver has been getting bigger and stronger. He is down to just three medications and only uses his feeding tube at night. He nurses during the day and even eats solids now! We had several hospitalizations over that time but they were due to a stomach virus, bad cold or the flu. Due to the delicate nature of the first repair, the doctors are cautious with him and we were admitted to Egleston more frequently than we would have liked.""</p><p>Latest update after 2nd surgery:</p><p>""Oliver is in stable condition and the doctors are pleased. He's not totally out of the woods but since he did so great with surgery, he will likely have an uncomplicated recovery. We are hoping for a quick stay in the ICU. You will be amazed at how fast<br/>all those tubes will come out, leaving him looking like Oliver again. I can't wait!!""</p><p><br/></p><p>Jan 19th update,</p><p>We all hoped for a quick, uncomplicated recovery for Oliver. We don't always get what we hope for. I wanted to post an update that Oliver's mom, Chrissy wrote a few days ago about the experience she's been going through these past days and months. </p><p>""<b>As you can probably imangine, the ICU is a hectic place. The cardiac ICU at Egleston is very open. You can look up and down and see other patients, families, nurses, doctors, tons of equipment. Nothing much is hidden, it's all out in the open. You can see when someone is having a good day like yesterday when a crib arrived for my neighbor. That meant they were being transferred to the step down unit. The bad days are evident too. Today was one of those days. Emergencies erupted all over the unit today. I had a difficult, tearful day but I know that others had it worse.

He was a beautiful 8lb 12oz baby and we had no idea that anything was wrong. One of the wonderful nurses discovered a heart murmur that changed our lives. He was so healthy and strong that we all thought his murmur was not serious but they called a cardiologist to come in to be sure. He discovered Oliver had a serious congenital heart defect and we had to move over to Egleston immediately.Oliver had several issues with his heart but the main diagnosis was an IAA (interrupted aortic arch). The aorta, which carries oxygenated blood from the heart to the body, was not fully formed. This normally prevents any blood flow from circulating to the body and lower extremities but Oliver had two other defects that kept his blood flowing and masked that he was even having any trouble. He also had a PDA (patent ductus arteriosus). This is a connection between the pulmonary artery (the vessel that brings deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs) and the aorta which allows blood flow to bipass the lungs during fetal circulation. Usually, this closes very quickly after birth but with Oliver, it stayed open. This connection allowed some of the blood to flow from the pulmonary artery to the lower part of the aortic arch, bringing blood to the body. The third defect is a VSD (ventricular septal defect) which is a hole between the ventricles. This defect allowed the oxygenated and deoxygenated blood to mix in the heart. Instead of deoxygenated blood being carried through the pulmonary artery, mixed blood flowed through and brought oxygen to his body. Although he was stable before his surgery, his condition would have changed very quickly if the PDA closed. We are so thankful that it was discovered early.Oliver was given a medication to keep his PDA open and that bought us time at Egleston to plan Oliver's surgery. After many tests, the surgical team decided they would have to do a stepped approach to Oliver's repair rather than one surgery to fix his heart. Due to the changes in his blood flow, parts of his heart and vessels did not develop as large as they normally would and he would need multiple surgeries and time to grow in between.At one week old, Oliver had his first open heart surgery. Dr. Kanter went in to repair the arch and preformed a procedure called the Norwood. This is usually done on babies with only one ventricle which allows mixed blood (oxygenated and deoxygenated) to flow throughout the body. They left the VSD allowing his blood to mix and used his PDA to aid in rebuilding the arch as well his pulmonary artery. Finally, they placed a shunt (artificial vessel) to act as the pulmonary artery and take blood to the lungs. This temporary repair allowed Oliver to grow but the shunt was small and would need replacing in 6-9 months. The surgery was very complex and took almost 12 hours to complete but Dr. Kanter made sure the repair was perfect.We were able to see Oliver after surgery and at that time it well past midnight. His chest was open due to swelling and he had many chest tubes and lines coming out of him. I couldn't even recognize him laying there. It was such a horrible sight. He was still on the breathing tube and sedated so we went home to rest after our long day.The next morning I arrived early and was there until mid afternoon. I hadn't really slept and the nurse urged me to go home and get some sleep. Oliver was doing well and the critical 12 hour period after surgery had passed. I finally gave in, feeling exhausted. Shortly after I left his heart stopped. I had barely been home when we got the call. They were not able to get his heart functioning but they were able to put him on ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) which is a heart lung bypass machine. This machine does the work of Oliver's lungs and heart while allowing his heart time to recover. I am so thankful that ECMO exisits but it is not something you ever want to need. When we arrived back at Egleston, there were more connections coming out of his chest, carrying the blood out of his body to ECMO and back in again. Five days passed and the doctors felt they could try to take him off. We were warned before that if it was not successful now, he would not likely survive but he was strong and regained function of his heart.After a couple days and a chest closure later, it was time to try to get him off his vent and get him breathing on his own. Each time we extubated him from the vent he had respiratory distress and collapse of his left lung. After several days of trying different things, the doctors discovered his left diaphragm was moving in the opposite direction than it should. Instead moving down and helping the lung open when Oliver took a breath, it pushed up and, along with some fluid in the lung, caused it to keep collapsing.The solution to this was to have another surgery. They did what was called a diaphragm plication. This is where they go in through the ribs and tie the diaphragm down in the open position preventing it from pushing against the lung. He did well with this surgery and we were finally able to get him off the breathing tube.The next hurdle to get over was feeding. We started feeding Oliver tiny amounts through a feeding tube that ran through his nose. He was not able to tolerate even the smallest amounts of food and we discovered he had severe acid reflux. Now we were facing yet another surgery. This time, Oliver had a fundoplication and a g-tube placed. A fundoplication is where the surgeon wraps part of the stomach around the base of the esophagus and the upper part of the stomach allowing food to go in but preventing anything from coming out. This kept the reflux from traveling up his esophagus and causing him to throw up. The g-tube is a tube placed into the stomach through the wall of the abdomen. This is where his feeding primarily took place but with the help of time and feeding therapy, the doctors were confident that he would be able to have the g-tube removed.We were finally able to feed him with the help of the tube and we were increasing feedings gradually to his reach his goal. Again, he was breathing on his own after being on the vent again for the third surgery. We were hoping to get him out of the ICU when he developed an arrythmia that could be life threatening. He still had an external pacemaker thankfully and they were able to control it while they tested different antiarrythmia medications to treat it. Many of these drugs could cause harmful side effects so finding a balance was a delicate and time consuming project.After some time, arrythmia controlled, we were transferred to the cardiac step-down unit where we learned more about how to care for Oliver at home. He had a dizzying 13 medications to be administered throughout the day and he was getting his feedings through a pump into his tube. There was a lot to learn in just a couple short days. It was seven weeks to the day and we were finally discharged home.Almost two months late, we brought our baby home from the hospital. After an adjustment period, we developed a routine. We juggled many appointments with the cardiologist, feeding therapist, physical therapist, pulmonologist, gasteroenterologist, and pediatrician. It was hard at first but we were all so relieved to be together as a family again. Even Lewis adored his baby brother dispite him getting much of the attention.Over the last six months, Oliver has been getting bigger and stronger. He is down to just three medications and only uses his feeding tube at night. He nurses during the day and even eats solids now! We had several hospitalizations over that time but they were due to a stomach virus, bad cold or the flu. Due to the delicate nature of the first repair, the doctors are cautious with him and we were admitted to Egleston more frequently than we would have liked.""Latest update after 2nd surgery:""Oliver is in stable condition and the doctors are pleased. He's not totally out of the woods but since he did so great with surgery, he will likely have an uncomplicated recovery. We are hoping for a quick stay in the ICU. You will be amazed at how fastall those tubes will come out, leaving him looking like Oliver again. I can't wait!!""Jan 19th update,We all hoped for a quick, uncomplicated recovery for Oliver. We don't always get what we hope for. I wanted to post an update that Oliver's mom, Chrissy wrote a few days ago about the experience she's been going through these past days and months. ""As you can probably imangine, the ICU is a hectic place. The cardiac ICU at Egleston is very open. You can look up and down and see other patients, families, nurses, doctors, tons of equipment. Nothing much is hidden, it's all out in the open. You can see when someone is having a good day like yesterday when a crib arrived for my neighbor. That meant they were being transferred to the step down unit. The bad days are evident too. Today was one of those days. Emergencies erupted all over the unit today. I had a difficult, tearful day but I know that others had it worse. One nurse touched my shoulder and commented that there were a lot of tears in the ICU today. It made me realize that I'm not alone. I know how fortunate I am that I will mostly likely bring my baby home with me. It may not be on my timeline but I will. Some others will not be so fortunate. I left this evening and noticed a couple in the consult room, tear soaked faces with a tiny baby not far away with doctors huddled around. Lowell and I were once that couple. I felt so terrible for them but it also made me realize how much we have overcome in this past 8 months. The ICU is a horrible and wonderful place. So much healing and heartache surrounds it.

</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>We are interested in raising $1.6 million dollars in this campaign.  That's one dollar for every expected new case of cancer in the US in 2015.  Your contributions to our campaign will be used to accelerate the development of our important and life enhancing technology.  With your help, we can secure the manpower and equipment needed to complete the development and testing of our massively parallel blood analyzer.  This will enable us to bring our product to the marketplace in 2017, a full two years earlier than originally projected.  If we are unable to reach our full campaign goal, any funding we receive will allow us to continue to move the project forward while we secure other sources of capital.<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>Cancer disrupts the lives of so many people.  It doesn't care where you live, how much money you earn or what kind of contribution you are making to the world.  Our massively parallel blood analyzer will enable doctors to quickly and easily measure the success of a current course of treatment and make changes to the treatment plan, if appropriate.  This increases the opportunity for more patients to have a better prognosis and a happier outcome.  In addition, our technology opens the door for a future diagnostic blood test for cancer that could become a standard part of your annual blood testing.<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>The risk of not meeting our goals
through this crowdfunding campaign is that our massively parallel
blood analyzer won’t be available for clinical use until at least 2019. 
Although several regulatory hurdles and many known (and some as yet unknown)
technical challenges will need to be overcome before our approach can be widely
accepted and used by the medical community, we strongly believe that four years
is too long to wait for the millions of cancer victims who will be newly diagnosed or who will be undergoing treatment during that time frame. <br/></p>
<p> <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>We appreciate all contributions to our campaign, whether big or small, but we understand this might not be the right time for you to help us financially.  Another way you can help is by spreading the word about our campaign to anybody and everybody you know.   The greater the crowd we can gather, the greater our  opportunity for success.<br/>

<h3>
<span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><br/></span>On July 14th a gas leak in my best friend Caleb's house was ignited and the house literally exploded. He was the only one home at the time and the explosion shook the entire neighborhood. His neighbor was able to pull him from the rubble of the house after hearing his screams for help. He was then rushed to the burn unit at the local hospital for immediate treatment.</h3>
<p> </p>
<h3>Currently, he is in stable condition at the hospital, but over 85% of his body is covered in burns, most of them third degree. He is in an induced coma right now as the doctors try to fight off infections and clear off all the dead skin. He is going to reamin in this coma for approximately a month and a half and only his immediate family will be able to see him. Once he is woken up he will then have another month and a half of surgeries and recovery in the hospital. Finally after these 3 months he will then have to go into rehab for further recovery.</h3>

<span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><br/></span><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">BACKGROUND:</span>
</h2>
<p>Caleb is a 21 year old student and construction worker. He was going to move out of his house in less than a month and move to Bloomington, IN to attend Indiana University as business student. When Caleb wasn't spending time with his family you could either find Caleb at the YMCA dunking on people in basketball or attending concerts with his close friends. He is a fun loving, easy going individual &amp; one of the best friends anyone can ask for. He was never afraid to lend help to anyone who needed it, and he was always there in times of need for his friends. Now is Caleb's time of need and he needs us more than ever.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">OUR GOAL:</span></h2>
<p>This is going to be an <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">extremely</span> long recovery process for Caleb. It will involve many surgeries and skin grafts and many many hours of rehab. Anyone who has ever been involved in medical procedures can all attest to one thing: it's very expensive. Caleb won't even be able to leave the hospital for three months. This is where we come in. I've set a goal of $3000 which I think is very attainable. I would love to make more, but one step at a time. I know in the grand scheme of things $3000 might not make that much difference in the huge medical expenses that will pile up, but any little bit can help. All donations will be given to Caleb's parents to pay for whatever medical expenses they can cover. <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><br/></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>It's important to understand that Caleb literally has nothing right now. No clothes, no computer, no shoes, no house. The only thing he does have right now is the love and support of everyone around him. When he wakes up in a month and half his entire world is going to be rocked by what he sees. The only thing that will get him through the most difficult time in his life is having people there who love and care for him unconditionally. This is why I've set the deadline as September 1st. This will be approximately the day the doctors wake Caleb up out of his coma. When he wakes up I hope to not only show him that he has the support of all his friends and family, but that he has the support of strangers that have never even met him before.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>I understand that not everyone is able to help financially. But whether you decide to donate or not, one thing you can do is share Caleb's story. Share this page on Facebook or Twitter or whatever way you can. This young man is fighting for his life right now and he needs support from anyone who will lend it.</h3>

<h3>A Bit About Captain Active and His Show<br/>
</h3> <p>Captain Active's mission is to show kids and families how much fun they can have being active and eating healthy.  There are too many kids staring at screens, lazying around and eating junk food, so Captain Active's doing something about it!<br/></p>
<p>The Captain Active Awesome Active Adventure Stage Show, is an action packed hour of fun, laughs, music, games, imagination and education for school students.  Captain Active is performing the show at primary schools all over Australia, taking audiences on an incredible mission to 
overcome the evil and unhealthy habits of his arch nemesis Lazy Cray 
Cray!</p>
<p>Many large schools have the budget and means to provide the show for their students, however, many small regional and remote schools with less than 100 students aren't as lucky and therefore are missing out.  Your contribution towards this campaign will allow Captain Active to reach the students in these small schools and inspire, motivate and educate them to want to lead an active, healthy lifestyle.<br/></p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What Your Contribution Will Create</h3>Although Captain Active's primary focus is to encourage kids and families to be active and healthy, he still needs to earn a living, so there is a fee of $5/student for schools to host the Captain Active Awesome Active Stage Show.  The minimum fee to ensure the show is finacially viable for Cap Ac is $500/school*.  <b>This unfortunately disadvantages small schools that have less then 100 students and they either have to pay much more per student or pass up the opportunity of seeing the show.</b><br/><br/><i><b>YOUR FUNDING WILL SUBSIDISE PERFORMANCES AT SMALL SCHOOLS</b></i> so that these students only pay $5 each, just like at the big schools.  For example, a school with 30 children will pay $150 and contributions from this campaign will pay the balance of $350.  A school with 50 children will pay $250 and be subsidised $250.  This way:<br/><ul>
<li>Students in small schools get to enjoy and learn from the show</li>
<li>They will pay the same amount as students in bigger schools</li>
<li>Captain Active will be able to spread his awesome active messages and enthusiasm to all parts of rural and regional Australia<br/>
</li>
<li>Captain Active won't go bankrupt in the process!
</li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The $6,500 budget goal for this campaign will allow Captain Active to visit at least 20 small schools (based on an estimated average of 40 students/school requiring a $300 subsidy) all over Australia!!  That equates to over 800 students, plus teachers, parents and younger siblings in regional and rural parts of Australia, who would otherwise miss out.</p>
<p> [* The cost of $500/school includes travel and accommodation time and expenses, bookings, promotion and administrative costs.  All these tasks are carried out by Captain Active. There are no other funding sources provided for this project]<br/></p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Awesome Perks</h3>
<p>By contributing to this campaign, you will not only be putting huge smiles on kids' faces and creating lots of awesome active and healthy kids, you'll become a <b>Captain Active Champion</b> and recieve some very cool perks, including:<br/></p>

<h3>Why Planet Earth Needs Captain Active<br/>
</h3>
Our next generation desperately need to be inspired to
be active and taught how to be healthy, because:<br/><ul>
<li>The dollars from major corporations to market fast foods and unhealthy convenience foods is not going to decrease</li>
<li>The attraction towards hand held devices and screen technology is going to increase</li>
<li>TV shows and interactive computer games are going to continue to entice kids to sit and be sedentary<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Captain Active simply wants to show kids how much fun they can have by <b>choosing to get outside and play games; choosing to eat healthy, fresh foods; choosing to climb, ride, jump, paddle, run and swim; and choosing to lead a healthy, balanced lifestyle.</b><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>2016 - The Year Ahead<br/>
</h3>
<p>Already for 2016, Captain Active has booked show performances with 15 schools in Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia. Here is what a school Principal said about the show last year:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>""Captain Active engaged our students in a fun,
interactive and exciting show. Not only did our students love Captain Active,
they were singing his riddles, doing his actions, playing his games and talking
about his healthy food messages in the days and weeks following his show. They
shared his message with their families, siblings, friends and teachers. We
can’t wait to see Captain Active again next year!”</i><br/></p></blockquote>
<p>Captain Active also has a school holiday show tour of four regional Queensland towns taking place in January 2016.  Here's what a Mum said about the show performed in Townsville before Christmas: <i><br/></i></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>""<span>LOVED the show! I am putting your name out there to lots of parents as we really value what you are doing. We constantly hear statements like ""Does Captain Active eat this"" ""Is this food healthy"" etc from our son which proves how influential you are in his mini world!!  Thanks!""</span></i></p>
<p><i><span><br/></span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>2015 - A Breakthrough Year<br/>

Organic food - We think we know what it is. With sales reaching £1.86 billion in the UK in 2014. Do we, as a nation, actually know what we're buying? Why are we paying the extra money? We're told it's better for us and less damaging to the environment, but is this the truth?


There is no denying it; organic food is everywhere,
taking over meat, vegetables, fruit and even cosmetic goods. With shoppers
spending an extra £1.4 million a week on organic products in the UK alone,
isn’t it time we asked ourselves what the difference really is? 


In this 15 minute, content packed documentary, our
presenter will investigate what qualities food and products have to possess to
be classed as organic. We will follow the journey from the beginning of seed

   What We Need & What You Get As a vegan and a inspiring documentary filmmaker this is a project that I am hugely passionate about.
However to make this film to the best quality it can, I need to raise some funds to support the different finances required for the production which are:  Transport costs between locations for the crew and cast. Feeding crew and cast for the duration of the shoot. Accommodation for crew and presenter during the 4 days of shooting. 
 Transcribers for the many interviews.
Graphics and editorial fees. 
I am asking for any spare change you might have to donate to contribute to my budget. Anything you can give will be greatly appreciated. 
   The Impact 

We’re all on the look out to learn how to stay healthy
and with the increase of organic foods appearing on our supermarket shelves. The public are becoming ever more curious as to what organic food is and why
they should spend the extra money on it. We want to uncover the truth that the public and everyday consumer deserves to know. 
    Our Challenge We want to create a honest representation of the organic industry: this requires us to travel around England to find the best possible contributors who are considered experts in their industries. This takes time and money, so it is vital that we receive funding to help this project.

Once you know what works, you can use carrier oils as single-ingredient beard oils, design your own beard oils, or seek out beard oils that feature carrier oils that work for you. Carrier oils do more than their name implies, they are an active ingredient, doing most of the hard work of keeping your beard healthy, happy, and under control. Ask anyone who makes their own beard oil and they'll rant and rave about the benefits of their favorite carrier oils.Wikipedia does an excellent job of defining what carrier oils are, even if they do fail to emphasize their role in beard oil formulas. - Wikipedia LinkThe job of carrier oils, and beard oils for that matter, is to serve as a substitute for your beard's natural sebum oil.  Sebum is an oily substance produced by sebaceous glands that coats, moisturizes, and protects your skin and hair. Beards just don't produce enough of it and that why beard oil is such a necessity for us beardsmen. Just because we made up the term ""single-ingredient beard oil"" doesn't mean it's a new thing. Because carrier oils are the unscented workhorses of the beard oil industry, many bearded men turn to them as a money-saving substitute/alternative to pricey beard oils. Which is why we like to call them ""single-ingredient beard oils.""Beard oils mimic the natural sebum oils produced by the skin, and are composed mainly of carrier oils and essential oils. - Wikipedia LinkGenerally speaking, a beard oil is any combination of two or more carrier and essential oils used to moisturize and soften beard hair and skin. A single-ingredient beard oil is any one carrier oil being used as a beard oil. Early backers will help us decide which carrier oils go into the Bearded Roots Test Kits. We'll be digging into specific carrier oils in our Updates as the campaign progresses.Carrier Oils Included in Kit • Fractionated Coconut Oil • Jojoba Oil • Argan Oil • Sweet Almond Oil • Hemp Seed Oil • Meadowfoam Seed Oil • Grapeseed Oil • Avocado Seed OilRewards Remaining Rewards: 8-packsIncluded in the Bearded Roots Test Kits (8-pack)• 100% Pure Carrier Oil Samples (10 ml bottles w/ restrictor caps)• Demo Sheets to Track Results• Trees Planted in Your Name• + Add-ons (combs)1 tree is planted for every bottle of carrier oil in our test kits.

</div></div>","Our Story
Hi my name is Melvin Williams; I was born and raised in Los
Angeles, CA. Iâ€™ve been a fan of sports all my life.  What I most admire about sports is the
competitive nature, feeling like Iâ€™m part of organization representing my city.
I consider myself down to earth, easy going, love all sports, family oriented,
church going and try to participate in all the positive things in life.  My most satisfying is  trying to find ways to help other.
 


I would like to build an all
     sports fan team with the help of all the fans around the world.

As sports fans we
     congratulate the team performance so they know that we are always there
     for them.  We tell our teams how
     their work touches our hearts and motivates us.


As fans we become season
     ticket holders, dedicate years out of our lives to support the
     organization, favorite teams and its players no matter what the outcome
     Fans have gone to great lengths to show their appreciation and
     loyalty.  Fans, appreciated the
     struggles of their teams, the wins, and loses etc.



But lets face it Fans are
     typically powerless , or have no say when owner, players and commissioners
     decided what they think is best for the teams without asking us for our
     opinion. 

I would like to
     start an all sports fan base across the US, so that we as fans have a
     voice to protect the fans investments in sports. And can be at the
     bargaining table when things are going down hill for some reason.




Its time for
fans to unite together as 1 and have a voice. 
Its not about the team you love and support this is about the fans being
heard and acknowledge.

If you think
about it at the end of the day the fans is who makes the sports world go
around.




The Impact


 
Is to have an elected fan from
each state, to represent their state.  
We as fans will no longer have a
quiet voice and feel unappreciated as fans.

Without fans there would be no
teams, owners or contracts. 


Our Goals


To get enough fans around the
world on board to get behind this. USA Fans Dream Team. In my life time I would
love to see when a professional teams discuss a lockout that the USA Fans Dream
Team would have enough voice to disrupt any talks of a lock out.  To make this very simple the teams would need
the buy in of the fans all around the world before the lockout can happen.  It would no longer tolerated that fans have
to idly stand by and take whatâ€™s given to them by the teams, (because
apologizing and saying we are sorry will not be enough for the fans).  I have so many more ideas and goals for USA
Fans Dream Team. 

To
list hereâ€™s one idea; I would like every professional sports team to have a
drawing for 4 top of the line seats, food and drinks made available for fans at
every game including playoffs. 


Face it, thatâ€™s a drop in the bucket for the
owners.  So letâ€™s not wait for the next
discussion or lockout to take place.
 


A contribution of $1 will help
make this dream a reality for all professional sports fans around the world. $1 may seem to be a small
donation, but with all the sports fans around the world can make this dream a
reality. Your donations is a start of your voice being heard.

<h3><i>The Dream Origin</i></h3>
<p>The inception of the dream began when my visa ended my career as a successful Strength and Conditioning coach in the United States and I had to move back to my home country of Poland. Strength and Conditioning is in my DNA and in my years in the US, I saw my programs transform the athletes I worked with physically and emotionally. Seeing this progress created the desire to facilitate this same progress in my own community.</p>

<p>With my good friend Artur of many years, we started Strength and Conditioning Education Center (SCEC). The organization is designed to share our knowledge and experience around proper training, nutrition and an overall healthy lifestyle. We train athletes, publish our own athletic performance and fitness articles and instructional videos. To further expand our reach, we hold certification courses to teach other coaches these tools. We have been lucky to have our own space to train and educate, however, this 850 square feet facility quickly became limiting. With the high costs to own a bigger facility, renovate and purchase additional equipment, we knew we wouldn’t be able to do it on our own.</p>

<h4>VIDEO AND DATA FROM THE BEEHIVE</h4>
<div>EyesOnHives uses a camera and computer to visually monitor what goes on at the bee hive all day, every day. Activity is measured by tracking the number of flying bees.</div>
<div>
<br/><p></p>
<h4>ADVANCED TECH THAT'S EASY TO USE</h4>
<p>Colony activity patterns are tracked over time using computerized video analysis. Hours of video is automatically translated into an easy to understand, visual, real-time summary for beekeepers.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<div>
<h4>MEASURES THE HIVE AS A WHOLE</h4>
<p></p>
<p>A key insight is that it’s not just the ‘count’ of individual bees that matters, it’s their flight behavior. EyesOnHives doesn’t just look at bees, it measures flight behavior of the hive as a superorganism!</p>

<h2>CREATED BY AND FOR BEEKEEPERS</h2>

<h3>FINALLY, DATA SCIENCE TO HELP THE BEES</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<p>One of the most exciting things we found was what we call the ""orientation spike"" in data.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455605603/q2occnyugfiojynls4or.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In a healthy hive we see an activity spike mid-afternoon as new field bees take their first 'orientation' flights.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Sick hives, or hives that are under attack, show different activity signatures.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455605669/vhab8iwth9cjmfuzyvwm.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<div>Graphing the average daily bee activity over time shows how a hive is growing.<br/>

<div style=""text-align: center;""><br/></div>It turns out the flight activity is an indication of hive health as it grows and gives an early warning if something is wrong.<br/>

<h4>BEES MAKE LIFE MORE AWESOME</h4>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">We’re beekeepers ourselves and believe that sustainable solutions embrace the principles of permaculture rather than pesticides. EyesOnHives gives beekeepers better data to make smart decisions, and help keep our pollinators around.</span><p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h4>WE AND THE BEES NEED YOU</h4>With your help we can start collecting data from many regions across the US and eventually the world. The ability to use video analytics to issue alerts and predict hive outcomes is in its infancy. More data is needed to help correlate specific hive diseases, pests, and bee behavior to the hive activity measurements.<br/><p><br/></p>

A Health Monitor For Honey Bees




1/3 OF OUR FOOD DEPENDS ON BEES
More than honey! Without bees we don’t have watermelons, cashews, cucumbers, apples, mangoes, avocados, almonds, apricots, cherries, pears, peaches, nectarines, raspberries, blackberries and blueberries to name a few. Not to mention beef or dairy. Guess what pollinates the alfalfa and clover grass the cows eat?



42% OF BEE COLONIES DIED IN 2014
Since 2006 beekeepers have reported colony losses exceeding 30%, which is unsustainable. To make up for losses, beekeepers divide colonies (called splitting), to force the bees to make 2 weak colonies from 1 strong one. But more weak colonies leads to higher loss rates, so there’s no stable bee population in sight.

EYESONHIVES HELPS BEEKEEPERS
We’re so passionate about this issue we built a technology from scratch to better understand what was happening at bee hives, alert beekeepers to changes, and help them understand their bees with software that measures hive activity, and gives video playback and alerts through a web app.



CONNECTS BEEKEEPERS TO THEIR BEES

VIDEO AND DATA FROM THE BEEHIVE
EyesOnHives uses a camera and computer to visually monitor what goes on at the bee hive all day, every day. Activity is measured by tracking the number of flying bees.


ADVANCED TECH THAT'S EASY TO USE
Colony activity patterns are tracked over time using computerized video analysis. Hours of video is automatically translated into an easy to understand, visual, real-time summary for beekeepers.


MEASURES THE HIVE AS A WHOLE

A key insight is that it’s not just the ‘count’ of individual bees that matters, it’s their flight behavior. EyesOnHives doesn’t just look at bees, it measures flight behavior of the hive as a superorganism!









CREATED BY AND FOR BEEKEEPERS
When Paul, a beekeeper of 40+ years asked us to count bees coming out of a hive because he couldn't check on it frequently enough himself - now that bees are so vulnerable to colony collapse - we were inspired to help.







CROWD SOURCED DATA TO HELP BEEKEEPERS
Every beehive contributes data to the EyesOnHives analytics platform and improves the system for all beekeepers. You can support the effort directly as a beekeeper, or backer.












YOUR BEES ON YOUR iPHONE, REALLY!
The EyesOnHives Analytics web app, is PC / Mac / iOS / Android / Linux compatible






FINALLY, DATA SCIENCE TO HELP THE BEES

One of the most exciting things we found was what we call the ""orientation spike"" in data.

In a healthy hive we see an activity spike mid-afternoon as new field bees take their first 'orientation' flights.

Sick hives, or hives that are under attack, show different activity signatures.



Graphing the average daily bee activity over time shows how a hive is growing.


It turns out the flight activity is an indication of hive health as it grows and gives an early warning if something is wrong.



It feels pretty great to save an entire colony of creatures. No more finding they've all died because they didn't get help.





VIDEO MAKES DATA EASY TO UNDERSTAND

KEEPING AN EYE ON BEE HIVES
Video, timelapse and beehive activity data is available through the web app, which is PC / Mac / iOS / Android / Linux compatible. Beekeepers can see videos of interest, if anything unusual occurred at their hives, and quickly notice trends.







SHARING BEES AND KNOWLEDGE
EyesOnHives makes it easy to share with others to promote awareness and knowledge of bee health and activity patterns. Turns out some pretty surprising things happen in front of a beehive too.






WATCH WHAT THE BEES ARE DOING
Skilled beekeepers look at hive activity and know the bees need assistance. But too often problems are not seen until it is too late and the colony is lost. We asked 'what if all beekeepers could continuously monitor their hive?"" Now they can!






VIDEO AT THE HIVE ENTRANCE
Storch's At The Hive Entrance catalogs ""How to know what happens inside the hive by observation on the outside"". We were inspired. EyesOnHives allows beekeepers to use this same visual intuition remotely.








FIELD TESTED FOR OVER A YEAR
We started tracking hives over a year ago and have already run a successful pilot program with local beekeepers, learning more and building the beginnings of a community along the way.








JOIN US
BEES MAKE LIFE MORE AWESOME
We’re beekeepers ourselves and believe that sustainable solutions embrace the principles of permaculture rather than pesticides. EyesOnHives gives beekeepers better data to make smart decisions, and help keep our pollinators around.

WE AND THE BEES NEED YOUWith your help we can start collecting data from many regions across the US and eventually the world. The ability to use video analytics to issue alerts and predict hive outcomes is in its infancy. More data is needed to help correlate specific hive diseases, pests, and bee behavior to the hive activity measurements.

JOIN IF YOU'RE A BEEKEEPERIf you are a beekeeper, EyesOnHives gives you greater access and connection to your bees, while saving you time. Become a member of our community of citizen scientists and watch videos of bees, see trending data from other hives, make comments, and help identify anomalies to improve the EyesOnHives alerts.

REQUIREMENTS
EyesOnHives is focused on backyard and rooftop beekeepers. The system does not disturb your colony, require modifications to your hive, or take hours to set up. Simply place the unit one to two feet away from the hive and point at the hive entrance. The system uses Wi-Fi to communicate alerts, upload video, and report trending data. Setup requires access to 120V power and a usable Wi-Fi signal at the hive. 


Power and WiFi are needed!

All units except Model Bee include 1 year access to the web application and analytics platform, which is accessible on any internet enabled computer or smartphone (iOS/Android), and is where you can see and graph all historical activity data. Approximately 14 days of archived videos are available for on demand viewing.

Driven by the toothbrush head in accordance with high frequency vibration to achieve a better brushing experience than mechanical and automatic toothbrushes.</p><p> </p><ul><li><strong>What are the advantages of a sonic toothbrush compared to manual and automatic toothbrushes?</strong></li></ul><p>Sonic toothbrushes have the following advantages:</p><p>1. Sonic toothbrushes clean more thoroughly and will whiten your teeth in the long-term.</p><p>Many people do not brush their teeth thoroughly that results in lot of bacteria and food compiling on the tooth surface. Over time that will create plaque and form calculus which can be hard to remove. Sonic toothbrushes have high-speed vibration that completely clean the tooth surface so they effectively remove plaque, preventing the production of calculus and ensuring your teeth are healthier. In addition, regular use of sonic toothbrushes can gradually whiten the teeth whereas manual and automatic toothbrushes are not very effective on in-depth clearing and whitening.</p><p>2. Sonic toothbrushes are safer and have less wear on teeth than manual and automatic toothbrushes.</p><p>Sonic toothbrushes is designed to break the toothpaste into tiny bubbles with the help of high speed vibration. It drives the water to remove the residues stuck between teeth. Many number of studies have shown that sonic toothbrushes are safer than manual toothbrushes because they do not harm the soft tissues and gums inside the mouth.</p><p>3. Reduce bleeding gums and prevents variety of oral diseases</p><p>Exports reports that bleeding gums is not caused by brushing too hard but mostly due to not brushing properly. Harmful bacteria near the gums generates germs which simulates gums bleeding. Sonic toothbrushes compared to manual and automatic toothbrushes can remove more than 38% of the bacteria on the teeth and reduce the bleeding rate of the gums by 60%.</p><p> </p><ul><li><strong>What advantages does the sonic electric toothbrush have compared to a rotary electric toothbrush?</strong></li></ul><p>Sonic electric toothbrushes clean the surface of the teeth and at the same time drives the flow of water to wash away any food residue stuck on the blind area within the mouth while rotary electric toothbrushes are not suited for the people with sensitive teeth, their motor mainly rely on the brush and tooth surface friction clean and make unnecessary noise.</p><p> </p><ul><li><strong>I have braces, can I use a sonic electric toothbrush?</strong></li></ul><p>Sonic toothbrushes do not affect your braces, professional dentists recommends using an electric sonic toothbrush on braces as it easily removes food residues stuck on the braces.</p><p> </p><ul><li><strong>Can the Oclean Air be used by children?</strong></li></ul><p>Oclean Air is an adult electric toothbrush.

Sonic toothbrushes clean more thoroughly and will whiten your teeth in the long-term.Many people do not brush their teeth thoroughly that results in lot of bacteria and food compiling on the tooth surface. Over time that will create plaque and form calculus which can be hard to remove. Sonic toothbrushes have high-speed vibration that completely clean the tooth surface so they effectively remove plaque, preventing the production of calculus and ensuring your teeth are healthier. In addition, regular use of sonic toothbrushes can gradually whiten the teeth whereas manual and automatic toothbrushes are not very effective on in-depth clearing and whitening.2. Sonic toothbrushes are safer and have less wear on teeth than manual and automatic toothbrushes.Sonic toothbrushes is designed to break the toothpaste into tiny bubbles with the help of high speed vibration. It drives the water to remove the residues stuck between teeth.

Whooping cough? No. It wasn't. In January 2011, they discovered tumors in her lungs. On a very sad day in April 2011, at the age of 40, she started chemotherapy again. She went to MD Anderson in Texas and to the National Institute of Health in Maryland for treatment. This is a very aggressive, fast moving cancer that is not responding to conventional treatment methods.<br/><br/>After 8 months of chemotherapy, it's not working.  Her tumors have grown significantly according to her latest PET Scan.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello there :)</p>
<p>   My name is Myles. I am a 20 year old transgender man. I was born female, but I have felt like a boy my entire life. It might be hard for some of you to image. If it is a bit hard to understand, try to picture yourself, everything about your emotions, feelings, and physical appearance. Image that your physical was the opposite gender. It's hard for some to understand, others not so much. I have been taking Testosterone (injections) for 1 year and 3.5 months. Since beginning hormone replacement therapy I have </p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Lost 10 lbs.</li>
<li>Gained more body hair</li>
<li>Grew noticeable facial hair</li>
<li>Grew 3 shoes sizes</li>
<li>My voice has deepened greatly (For you singers, I sing Baritone-High Bass range)</li>
<li>My body fat has redistributed to more masculine areas</li>
<li>Gain a bit more muscle in arms, chest, and legs</li>
<li>Acquired acne AGAIN! Haha fun!</li>
</ul>    I have gained quite a lot of confidence that I did not have before because of these changes, but my body still does not match who I am inside. After 20 years of this it becomes a lot to handle at times. I love life so much and being involved with activities and around people, but sometimes my body prevents this. I am very energetic as well and it is very hard to be unable to fully participate in activities like swimming, wrestling (like I want to. The singlets would should my breasts and absence of complete male genitalia and I would have to ware a women's singlet because the guys one cuts too low). It makes it so I can not shower or change ""normally"" with my peers in the locker room and it gets very awkward when I am playing a game and the guys want to divide up teams by having half of us go shirtless. <p></p>
<p>    It may not seem like much, but it hurts to be excluded because of something you can not control. It isn't even other people excluding me... it's my own body. It makes it a lot harder to date as well, which is not very fun because I have gotten my life together so to speak in many ways and I want to find someone to love and accept me like I do others that I meet in life. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What I Need Help With &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>    Right now I am trying to raise money to have ""top surgery"" or chest reconstructive surgery. It is scheduled for December, but I must have it paid in full by November. The total cost is $6,500 as well as accommodations because it is out of state and I have to have a pre-operative exam the day before and stay out there (Florida - where my doctor is, Dr. Garramone) for a week to get the drains and post-operative bandages off and be examined before flying home. I have some of the money, but I am very independent and with school and living expenses it is very hard to save enough. I had two jobs in the summer, but it still did not make much of a dent. </p>
<p>   I am working very diligently to try to create a slogan and design for a T-shirt and car magnet as ""Thank You""s for your donations. If you donate before they are ready I will make it up to you when they are done and come in! :) </p>
<p>* I will have a limited number, but if this site allows I will send personalized ""Thank You"" emails to all who help</p>
<p>    I want the slogan to basically show support for not only transgender persons, but all people regardless of what makes us different. I am very different from many people I have grown up with in many ways so I am a big supporter of unity among all and acceptance of each others differences. I am multi-racial, I do not care about gender in regards to who I date, I am transgender, and my family is different than most in many ways as well, so I UNDERSTAND different, but I BELIEVE in together... coming together and accepting each other no matter what.<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> </span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>   I will forever be grateful to you all for not only your monitary contributions, but also for the emotional support and acceptance it represents!! If I exceed my goal, the rest of the money will be donated to my good friend of many years who is going through the same thing and is also trying to save for surgery himself. He too of course would be very, very grateful! </p>

She lives on her own, and only receives a small disability pension. She has just been told she will have to go through a renal ablation in September in Nantes’ public Hospital. After this intervention, she will receive a special treatment for about a month in a specialized structure.<br/><br/><strong>Even though she tried very hard, today she is still missing 500€, which are necessery for the surgical operation…</strong><br/><br/>Each donation, even the smallest one, will help her raise that amount and give her access to health care.<br/><br/>Eg. 100 people giving 5€ = 500 € collected<br/><br/>It took a lot for Magali to overcome so many obstacles. Our greatest desire is that she improves health and get her life back to normal.<br/><br/>We count on you to forward the project especially on the social networks.</p>

Exemple : 100 personnes donnant 5€ = 500€ collectés
Il a fallu beaucoup de courage à Magali pour surmonter autant d'épreuves. Notre vœu le plus cher est qu'elle retrouve une bonne santé et une vie normale au plus vite.
Merci de diffuser le projet autour de vous en profitant du pouvoir de propagation offert par les réseaux sociaux.

We are Alice and Ludovic and we are collecting funds for Magali, a friend and neighbour, to help her get access to health care and hope she will soon recover.Magali has a permanent disability, due several bad diseases. She lives on her own, and only receives a small disability pension. She has just been told she will have to go through a renal ablation in September in Nantes’ public Hospital. After this intervention, she will receive a special treatment for about a month in a specialized structure.Even though she tried very hard, today she is still missing 500€, which are necessery for the surgical operation…Each donation, even the smallest one, will help her raise that amount and give her access to health care.Eg. 100 people giving 5€ = 500 € collectedIt took a lot for Magali to overcome so many obstacles. Our greatest desire is that she improves health and get her life back to normal.We count on you to forward the project especially on the social networks.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</p><p></p><p>Founded in 2012, UB Real, LLC is the brainchild of Scott Kanyok, a self-described “regular guy” turned avid outdoorsman and entrepreneur.</p><p>With his 40th birthday on the horizon, our founder was determined to get into the best shape of his life.  This former financial advisor was working to restore his health after being sidelined with a chronic upper thoracic injury for the better part of six years. Through countless hours of physical therapy and rehabilitation, Scott worked himself into good enough shape to participate in long-distance bike rides. Little did he know that this activity that he loved so much would change his life forever.</p><p>On January 29, 2008, while partaking in a 40-mile bike ride, Scott was struck by a box truck. Thrown violently from his bike, Scott suffered a fractured skull with a subdural hematoma and multiple other compound fractures. While Scott was in the intensive care unit, his family was told that he might not make it. Several surgeries later, with his body held together with titanium plates and screws, Scott was in for the fight of his life.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/414862/files/20140306061320-UB_About_Crash.jpg?1394115200"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p></p><p>With a severely compromised body and immune system, Scott knew he had to make serious changes on his road to recovery. He applied a relentless work ethic in all that he did, including extensive physical therapy, developing proper diet, supplementation and hygiene practices. Still, no matter how hard he tried, his weakened immune system caused him to develop constant upper respiratory infections for up to one month at a time.</p><p>Scott took an out-of-the-box approach to cleaning up his diet. He started experimenting with antioxidant-rich superfoods such as organic freeze dried acai, then maqui berry, camu camu and acerola cherry. Despite the improved diet, he still couldn’t shake his constant sickness – but he would not be deterred.</p><p>Needing to find a permanent solution to his ailments, Scott sought the help of a formulation expert and now friend, Jason Mitchell. Then the head of Research &amp; Development at Country Life Vitamins, Jason was able to help connect several missing links in the formulation. After four years of exhaustive research, trial and error, Scott and Jason developed a synergistic nutritional formula that combines superfoods, protein, organic vitamins, fulvic minerals, prebiotics and probiotics. Incorporating this wonder shake into his daily routine, Scott finally emerged from sickness – and he hasn’t looked back since.</p><p>That formula became the idea behind UB Super – a protein superfood nutritional shake made from the highest quality <i>real</i> ingredients found in nature. Scott is living proof that superior nutrition can have a profound effect on your health, and he is the embodiment of the old adage “you are what you eat”.

</div></div>","Who We Are
HealthBridge has been working since 1982 in Asia,
Africa and the Americas.
We do pioneering research to identify and address critical
gaps in achieving health and health equity in the developing world.  
We do this by working effectively with local
partners in order to collect data, then deliver programs and affect local policy informed by the data we collected.  This is crucial to our approach, which
looks to achieve lasting effect by learning respectfully from local practice,
then helping build and institutionalize local capacity.  We strive to adhere to this very Canadian
take on how to best make a difference in the world.
At the heart of our strategy is Prevention, rather than
cure.  We are leaders at harnessing technology in an innovative manner to
realize this strategy.
What We’ve Been Doing
HealthBridge is a leading edge deliverer of several
innovative programs:


Reproductive, Maternal and Child Health (India,
     Vietnam)

Livable Cities (India, Sri Lanka, Vietnam,
     Bangladesh, India, Nepal,
     Niger)

Tobacco and Non-communicable Disease Control 

Health, Nutrition and Food Security (South America, South East Asia, sub-Saharan Africa)

Your investment in this project will enable us to purchase 25 tablets and accessories for use in countries like Tanzania where we are fighting the problem of malaria and other diseases. To collect Smart Data, we train a group of 10-20 local field researchers to use this equipment . We've found that 20 people is a sweet spot where we can collect a lot of data quickly but keep the data collection consistent and coordinated. 


We use handheld devices to collect
data in a variety of contexts – interviews with mothers of young children,
health care workers and community leaders, as well as mapping anything from
habitat for mosquitos that transmit diseases to the locations of vegetable
stands. By using current technology, we ensure that the data we collect is of
the highest quality. And we get it in real time! No trucks (driving over rutty,
muddy roads) filled to the brim with paper surveys that then need to
be entered manually on a computer followed by months of analysis. No.  We
have the data as soon as there's a cell signal! Also we can take advantage
of collecting GPS coordinates to see how problems vary in space. This is

<div><br/></div>Hi to everyone out there. <br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I'm going to introduce you to our first working prototype of
a full thrusting, hand held pleasure device for both male and female who like
to feel that moment of effortless penetration. We call it <b>MiaMaxx</b>!</p>
<p>Unlike
others moving dildos, this device gives a full 75mm (3 inch stroke) for those
who want that edge when it really matters. It also has a brilliant vibrating function at the tip of the device.</p>
<p>As you can see from the video we've created
our first sexy prototype and it works as beautifully as we had hoped. The final manufactured product will be a tighter, smoother unit with electronics and additional clip-on sleeves finalized for you to enjoy the new deep thrusting experience. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The reason we're here is because... </span></p>
<p>We're at the end of a long but exciting development stage and
would like to complete the final moments of this project with the help of those
of you out there who understand this cool journey isn't yet finished.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>On behalf of the few of us who worked tirelessly on the
<b>MiaMaxx</b> prototype and its clip on sheath designs, we'd like to offer you the
opportunity to become part of its exciting completion.</p>

Further details of support through donation can be

<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>As  you can see from the video, we've created the working prototype.</p>
<p><b>B</b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">ut.. we need more funding to complete the first production run!</b></p>
<p>We are short $45,000 to complete the first
pre-orders and finalize the product for launch.</p>
<p>The development of <b>MiaMaxx</b>, though exciting
was a more expensive journey than planned for. We also know that to create
something special takes a special amount of time. This was reflected in the
research and development estimate of 24 months extending to a full 4 years.</p>
<p>Extra funding and your generous support,
whether verbal or financial is essential to the progress of <b>MiaMaxx</b>. We are so
close now. To have this very special pleasure device waiting to enter your
world in early 2015 would make our journey complete. Please support in any way
you can.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
</div><div>
<b>The Impact<span><br/></span></b><span><br/></span> <p><b>MiaMaxx</b> is a huge step forward for women and men. Throughout history static dildos and vibrators were the most used for pleasure. They were cool and made you feel good... but you did all the work,  <b>MiaMaxx</b> is carefully designed to ease this manual penetration.</p>
<p>As a supporter, you will helps us create the next generation of robotic devices so that will give us simulated sexual motions. We are<span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> confidant that you'll love <b>MiaMaxx</b> and we are super </span>thankful<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> to you for your support.</span></span></p>
<p></p>
<p><u><b>Now let's run through what MiaMaxx
can do for these groups.</b></u></p>
<p><b>MiaMaxx</b> will have a basic head length (sleeve) measuring
110mm (4 inches or so) which can be inserted in any orifice that gives you
pleasure. It can be used with or without lubrication although a lubricant is
recommended for the uninitiated. We will eventually develop our own brand, but <img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>first things first.</p>
<p><b>MiaMaxx</b> has a strong powerful vibrator
positioned at the tip. This allows it to be used as a standard dildo. So what you say? Been there, done that? <b>MiaMaxx</b> is not so one dimensional. It's a
sleek moving, deep penetrating, hard thrusting pleasure device that will
outlast many others before needing a quick re-charge from the charger. If you
can personally go on for hours and hours you will understandably outlast it and
probably need help, but never fear; if you're not finished partying you can
cruise through  with help from an extra longer than normal connector
leading back to your charger.</p>
<p>Before this would be needed, the
NiCad batteries of <b>MiaMaxx</b> will run for about 30 minutes. This should be enough
to please all but the deliciously insatiable.</p>
<p>All you have to do to begin is insert <b>MiaMaxx</b> from any
position then start it slowly thrusting. No need to push it in and out
yourself. Just hold it and enjoy. When you're comfortable and confident, you can
crank up the speed and drift away..</p>
<p></p>
<p>So who would take pleasure
from the smooth, effortless thrusting of this device? Well just about everyone! </p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b><span></span>The Head.</b></span><br/></p>
<p>At the moment, the maximum extension the head can give is a
full 75mm (3 inch) stroke to imitate the thrust of a partner.</p>
<p>It will eventually have two other
settings at 25mm (1 inch) and 50mm (2 inches) that can be set to random. Like a
guy who likes to dip and tease. (We're almost there with this..)</p>
<p>We are working to have a <b>full 95mm stroke (4 inches) </b>before
launch, but at the moment it is a nice 75mm (3 inches).The base unit tip diameter  is 42 mm narrowing to 30mm. The extra sleeves will come in many different girth sizes to suit the most adventurous. </p>

What for example are the negatives which could take away confidence in the product?</span></p>
</div><div>
<p>We believed there were 2 main items that needed attention. These are:</p>
<p>1. Electrical. (as in the charger lead)</p>
<p>2. Speed and depth of thrust.</p>
<p>Let's look at the first.</p>
<p>1. It's a known fact that anything electrical needs to be isolated from a water source. IE: Amps+volts+H2O= ZZZZap!! Not good.</p>
<p>Now <b>MiaMaxx</b> is a low voltage device and categorized as splash proof. It's not waterproof because of the charger port. In consequence care needs to be taken, especially when batteries are low and the charger cord is attached. We are compensating for the few who may take <b>MiaMaxx</b> into the shower or bath. We've done this by adding a basic cut-off circuit, like a safety switch. If the device is fully emerged whilst attached to a wall outlet, it will simply go to sleep and may never wake up again. In consequence the warranty may become void.</p>
<p>We have designers and electrical engineers working with us on this cut-off system and will be ready for product launch. Another alternative being considered is a magnetic coupler.</p>
<p>We have instructions regarding these NOT to do scenarios included in our 'How to use/warranty booklet. Of course <b>MiaMaxx</b> can be submerged for a short time in water, as long as the small rubber tab is pressed back into the charger port. This allows for a thorough cleaning after use.</p>
<p>So to reiterate. If you purchase a <b>MiaMaxx</b> through donation, please don't use it as a submarine or play ""Hide the Sausage"" in the shower. It will love you as much as you love it as long as you follow instructions.</p>
<p>2. Because of the unique thrusting motion of <b>MiaMaxx</b>, the potential for over insertion coupled to a fast motion speed could lead to internal bruising. To overcome this we are programming the electronics to only start the device on the slowest speed. It is then up to the individual to increase the speed and depth settings to find the most comfortable insertion depth. So! no surprises as a full and fast thrust tries to make your eyes pop and water.</p>
<p>Again, instructions regarding this operation are included in our 'How to use' and warranty booklet.</p>
<p>As an addition here we've taken great care to have <b>MiaMaxx</b> manufactured with the most recent and non-toxic materials as used within the Adult Toy Manufacturing Industry. A list of these will be posted as the final outer design and color is completed.</p>
<p><b>Possible concerns?</b></p>
<p><b>Q: </b>What if the removable clip-on head detaches whilst inside? <br/><b>A:</b> Well we'd like to say squat down and cough as hard as you can, but this isn't going to happen.</p>
<p>We looked at this possibility through earlier design stages and re-jigged the mechanism so a firm twist and tug would release the interchangeable head. If you have vaginal or rectal muscles strong enough to do this, well, there's another career for you somewhere out there.</p>
<p>The final concern is our dwindling overdraft and we hope its not about to bite us in the butt, especially now when we're so close to completion. Your generous donations, curious interest, recommendations to friends and the purchase of pre-launch <b>MiaMaxx</b> products will certainly ease the pain.</p>
<p>On a final note: All members of DareToo Pty Ltd and the Development Team have backgrounds in their own business affairs, so a firm management structure is in place to ensure a long and exciting future in creating many more robotic-type devices.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It’s been mentioned that our journey’s been
a long and sometimes frustrating one. Bruno believed in what had been created
but mechanical engineering and a sturdy thrusting framework was not a pretty thing. It had to be a sleek hand held pleasure device people would want to use with confidence. Because of this, we feel an
integral member of the Team should be awarded a special mention.</p>
<p><b>Eddie Norcott</b>, VP of engineering at EB2
Global, take a bow. You stayed true to Bruno’s dream when others were ready to
take to the bottle. His knowledge and insight within the engineering and
manufacturing industry coupled with his expertly sourced industry contacts allowed
for a continuous flow of design, research and development to evolve into the
sleek, hand held <b>MiaMaxx</b> we have today. His tenacity for solving the many
problems encountered has come to fruition and we can now take this moment to
personally say… “Thanks Eddie, for a great team effort.”</p>

Hi to everyone out there. 

I'm going to introduce you to our first working prototype of
a full thrusting, hand held pleasure device for both male and female who like
to feel that moment of effortless penetration. We call it MiaMaxx!
Unlike
others moving dildos, this device gives a full 75mm (3 inch stroke) for those
who want that edge when it really matters. It also has a brilliant vibrating function at the tip of the device.
As you can see from the video we've created
our first sexy prototype and it works as beautifully as we had hoped. The final manufactured product will be a tighter, smoother unit with electronics and additional clip-on sleeves finalized for you to enjoy the new deep thrusting experience. The reason we're here is because... 
We're at the end of a long but exciting development stage and
would like to complete the final moments of this project with the help of those
of you out there who understand this cool journey isn't yet finished.

On behalf of the few of us who worked tirelessly on the
MiaMaxx prototype and its clip on sheath designs, we'd like to offer you the
opportunity to become part of its exciting completion.

Further details of support through donation can be
found at Our Facebook Page

   What We Need & What You Get 
As  you can see from the video, we've created the working prototype.
But.. we need more funding to complete the first production run!
We are short $45,000 to complete the first
pre-orders and finalize the product for launch.
The development of MiaMaxx, though exciting
was a more expensive journey than planned for. We also know that to create
something special takes a special amount of time. This was reflected in the
research and development estimate of 24 months extending to a full 4 years.
Extra funding and your generous support,
whether verbal or financial is essential to the progress of MiaMaxx. We are so
close now. To have this very special pleasure device waiting to enter your
world in early 2015 would make our journey complete. Please support in any way
you can.






The Impact MiaMaxx is a huge step forward for women and men. Throughout history static dildos and vibrators were the most used for pleasure. They were cool and made you feel good... but you did all the work,  MiaMaxx is carefully designed to ease this manual penetration.
As a supporter, you will helps us create the next generation of robotic devices so that will give us simulated sexual motions. We are confidant that you'll love MiaMaxx and we are super thankful to you for your support.

Now let's run through what MiaMaxx
can do for these groups.
MiaMaxx will have a basic head length (sleeve) measuring
110mm (4 inches or so) which can be inserted in any orifice that gives you
pleasure. It can be used with or without lubrication although a lubricant is
recommended for the uninitiated. We will eventually develop our own brand, but first things first.
MiaMaxx has a strong powerful vibrator
positioned at the tip. This allows it to be used as a standard dildo. So what you say? Been there, done that? MiaMaxx is not so one dimensional. It's a
sleek moving, deep penetrating, hard thrusting pleasure device that will
outlast many others before needing a quick re-charge from the charger. If you
can personally go on for hours and hours you will understandably outlast it and
probably need help, but never fear; if you're not finished partying you can
cruise through  with help from an extra longer than normal connector
leading back to your charger.
Before this would be needed, the
NiCad batteries of MiaMaxx will run for about 30 minutes. This should be enough
to please all but the deliciously insatiable.
All you have to do to begin is insert MiaMaxx from any
position then start it slowly thrusting. No need to push it in and out
yourself. Just hold it and enjoy. When you're comfortable and confident, you can
crank up the speed and drift away..

So who would take pleasure
from the smooth, effortless thrusting of this device? Well just about everyone! 


Single women
Single men
Gay couples
Lesbian couples
Heterosexual couples

Anyone!





The Head.
At the moment, the maximum extension the head can give is a
full 75mm (3 inch) stroke to imitate the thrust of a partner.
It will eventually have two other
settings at 25mm (1 inch) and 50mm (2 inches) that can be set to random. Like a
guy who likes to dip and tease. (We're almost there with this..)
We are working to have a full 95mm stroke (4 inches) before
launch, but at the moment it is a nice 75mm (3 inches).The base unit tip diameter  is 42 mm narrowing to 30mm. The extra sleeves will come in many different girth sizes to suit the most adventurous. 
To accompany these thrusts MiaMaxx
has three speed settings; slow, medium and fast. Any combination of these
thrusts and speed settings is at the users fingertips easily reached via the
curved ergonomic handle. If it is held in both hands with the buttons in easy
view you will have an awesome ride and absolute control. No more slippery grip,
no more ""where's the off button..""
Check out the sleeves:











These are an assortment of ""click-on"" sleeves that
can be attached to the sleek MiaMaxx head. This gives a huge variety of shapes,
colors, textures and girth to an already tireless, pumping, hand held stud.
The sleeves are rippled, ringed, club shaped and spiraled
with an original penis shape and color range now considered.
This penis range would be part of a size and thickness
collection, although a standard shelf bought dildo is recommended over a
certain size because of structural and
mechanical limitations within the MiaMaxx unit.
Attachment close
to final design and production:
A cradle (see below) allows MiaMaxx
to be secured in place so full hands free operations can give you the perfect
orgasm.


The cradle has suction feet so it can sit securely on
walls, floor, bathroom tiles or even glass! It will not move or slide while MiaMaxx
gives its series of perfect strokes.


Attachments that are close to final
design and production:
Clitoral vibrator. Around the neck of MiaMaxx, behind
the extending bellows, a clitoral vibrator will be attached or molded into the
handle. (The next step to completion) This arcs over the bellows and would be
in constant clitoral contact. This
vibrator can be activated in addition to the tip vibrator, the depth settings
and the speed settings. So with the vibrators going and MiaMaxx thrusting,
everyone can have a load of fun.


So, in conclusion, if the Indiegogo project is successful we
will be able to complete the MiaMaxx features and develop further additional
extras or add-ons to enhance the toys pleasurable experience, (the stand for
example) but for now we only need to complete the main MiaMaxx unit and the
""click"" on sleeves.
So if you're gay or straight, male or female and you believe
this new deep thrusting, hand held device could represent a whole new sexual experience for you and your
friends; please help us support its final journey to completion.



How about an app?
Well, we have the
MiaMaxx and an array of erotic sleeves.


The next is the integration of WiFi into the toy. This would
be incorporated in MiaMaxx 2 allowing a partner to control the speed and depth
of thrust through their phone. Put the phone on speaker and start talking dirty.
As previously mentioned, the other feature of the second MiaMaxx would be the clitoral vibrator fixed to the handle. This would appeal mostly to female
groups for obvious reasons, but hey, whatever rocks your boat. To the guys out
there, turn in around and let it vibrate your scrotum.
But that is not the end.
The next step for us is to finalize
the positioning stand for hands free use. (See diagrams) It's a simple rotate
and lock device where the MiaMaxx can be used in many positions.
Over the long journey we have discussed with individuals and focus groups about certain aspects of the MiaMaxx device. What for example are the negatives which could take away confidence in the product?

We believed there were 2 main items that needed attention. These are:
1. Electrical. (as in the charger lead)
2. Speed and depth of thrust.
Let's look at the first.
1. It's a known fact that anything electrical needs to be isolated from a water source. IE: Amps+volts+H2O= ZZZZap!! Not good.

<p align=""JUSTIFY""><em>Dear Friends,</em></p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY""><em> </em></p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY""><em>Hello, My name is Tamra Barrow. I am 36 years old, with a wonderful husband Robert and three amazing children who reside in Burnet, TX. Robert and I have been married 9 years, and have had a very rough road.  My daughter Courtney (13) and son Colby (12), are from a previous marriage but Robert has raised them. We tried for three years to have a child together, finally we were blessed with Kenzie 6 years ago.  The family was finally complete. I started having some health issues right after Kenzie was born, and found out that I had Graves Disease and it was recommended that I receive iodine radiation. Before we could deal with this issue the following became priority.</em></p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY""><em> </em></p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY""><em>One morning approximately 5 years ago while getting my older children ready for school, Kenzie was not making any noise on the baby monitor so I let her sleep while preparing for the morning. When I went into her room, it was a terrible sight. My 7 month old with no previous issues, was in a full blown seizure, barely breathing, burning up with fever and lethargic. Needless to say, before EMS got Kenzie to the local hospital the seizure had lasted at least 25 minutes that we know of. The ICU team from Austin came to get her and we were taken to Brackenridge Children’s hospital (before Dell). After several tests, turned out she had developed a very rare condition called Hemiplegica Hemiconvulsion Epilepsy Syndrome. She was the youngest child and only the 5<sup>th</sup> child to  ever have this syndrome. The doctors told us she would never walk, talk or eat on her own. Kenzie’s insurance got dropped which was through my employer and caused my insurance to be dropped as well due to her maxing out the 2 million dollar lifetime benefit amount. This was in a 3 month period of ICU, Rehab, procedures and medicine that she had. She is now covered by Medicaid as that was our only option.</em></p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY""><em> </em></p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY""><em>Once we had her stable and home I had the radiation performed to destroy my Thyroid issue in 2007 and it was said that with medicine replacement it would soon get better. Well, it never did to this day. Though this process (due to being a single income family and me not having insurance). I had to just deal with my health and become a stay at home mom to take care of Kenzie.  Even with lots of therapy and treatments, Kenzie’s seizures continued to become more frequent, she would have anywhere from 2 to 30 a day. With my Grave’s Disease and her being so sick, I was exhausted and the family was in so much stress. Finally in 2009, they found out where the seizure’s were coming from and they performed a Functional Hemispherectomy on Kenzie and took half of her brain out. With a long recovery she is doing better. She continues to have seizures, Cerebral Palsy, and other health problems, though the surgery did give improvement. I still have to stay home with her and can’t hold a job due to all her monthly appointments and her disabilities. I do now have a wonderful team of nurses and personal attendants that help with her care and take some of the stress off of the family.</em></p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY""><em> </em></p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY""><em> </em></p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY""><em>My thyroid problems progressively got worse over all this time. I became so sick that we finally found a Endocrinologist that would take payments that did a Ultrasound and found a nodule on my thyroid. She sent me to a surgeon and in December of 2011, he took my thyroid out. None of the doctors thought it was cancerous, it turned out that the nodule and two of the six lymph nodes that they took out were stage 4 Papillary Thyroid Cancer.</em></p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY""><em> </em></p>

Dear Friends,
 
Hello, My name is Tamra Barrow. I am 36 years old, with a wonderful husband Robert and three amazing children who reside in Burnet, TX. Robert and I have been married 9 years, and have had a very rough road.  My daughter Courtney (13) and son Colby (12), are from a previous marriage but Robert has raised them. We tried for three years to have a child together, finally we were blessed with Kenzie 6 years ago.  The family was finally complete. I started having some health issues right after Kenzie was born, and found out that I had Graves Disease and it was recommended that I receive iodine radiation. Before we could deal with this issue the following became priority.
 
One morning approximately 5 years ago while getting my older children ready for school, Kenzie was not making any noise on the baby monitor so I let her sleep while preparing for the morning. When I went into her room, it was a terrible sight. My 7 month old with no previous issues, was in a full blown seizure, barely breathing, burning up with fever and lethargic. Needless to say, before EMS got Kenzie to the local hospital the seizure had lasted at least 25 minutes that we know of. The ICU team from Austin came to get her and we were taken to Brackenridge Children’s hospital (before Dell). After several tests, turned out she had developed a very rare condition called Hemiplegica Hemiconvulsion Epilepsy Syndrome. She was the youngest child and only the 5th child to  ever have this syndrome. The doctors told us she would never walk, talk or eat on her own. Kenzie’s insurance got dropped which was through my employer and caused my insurance to be dropped as well due to her maxing out the 2 million dollar lifetime benefit amount. This was in a 3 month period of ICU, Rehab, procedures and medicine that she had. She is now covered by Medicaid as that was our only option.
 
Once we had her stable and home I had the radiation performed to destroy my Thyroid issue in 2007 and it was said that with medicine replacement it would soon get better. Well, it never did to this day. Though this process (due to being a single income family and me not having insurance). I had to just deal with my health and become a stay at home mom to take care of Kenzie.  Even with lots of therapy and treatments, Kenzie’s seizures continued to become more frequent, she would have anywhere from 2 to 30 a day. With my Grave’s Disease and her being so sick, I was exhausted and the family was in so much stress. Finally in 2009, they found out where the seizure’s were coming from and they performed a Functional Hemispherectomy on Kenzie and took half of her brain out. With a long recovery she is doing better. She continues to have seizures, Cerebral Palsy, and other health problems, though the surgery did give improvement. I still have to stay home with her and can’t hold a job due to all her monthly appointments and her disabilities. I do now have a wonderful team of nurses and personal attendants that help with her care and take some of the stress off of the family.
 
 
My thyroid problems progressively got worse over all this time. I became so sick that we finally found a Endocrinologist that would take payments that did a Ultrasound and found a nodule on my thyroid. She sent me to a surgeon and in December of 2011, he took my thyroid out. None of the doctors thought it was cancerous, it turned out that the nodule and two of the six lymph nodes that they took out were stage 4 Papillary Thyroid Cancer.
 
The endocrinologist said I would need iodine radiation treatment so that the remaining Cancer would not spread, this costs around 8k which is yet to be done due to finances. All of this is to much to handle not having insurance. Knowing that Cancer is in my body has taken a toll on me and my entire family. They also diagnosed me with Hashimoto’s Disease since the removal making it virtually impossible to keep my thyroid hormone levels right with the use of thyroid replacements. The endocrinologist says that until I receive this iodine radiation treatment to remove all of the cancer cells, I will remain on this roller coaster.  I have applied for The Cancer Society’s program  and many other programs and can not seem to get any help. I also applied for the Pre-Existing Insurance plan with the government that has a high monthly premium, and also got denied for coverage, due to being on The Woman’s Health Care plan within the previous 6 months which ended in July of 2012, (this only covered my annual exam and birth control….not any health issues) this was my only hope. I have recently appealed their decision.
 
I am trying to get financial assistance so that I can get the care, and procedures I need done to raise my children and take care of the house front. In the process of all of this, I have also come upon a cluster of female problems and there are some treatments planned but with no insurance and no assistance I cant have these done. The Doctors want to try a shot to be sure of what is wrong before they do a full Hysterectomy.  I am not one for handout’s, and I hate to even be writing this letter, but due to spending over $10,000.00 over the last year on my surgery, doctor visits, x-rays, lab work etc. I have no other option.  My husband is becoming very depressed because we can’t afford it all with just his income, as I am unable to obtain employment due to caring for our handicapped daughter and my health.
 
The doctors have had me on bed rest and pain medicine for over 2 weeks. My whole family is falling apart and the children are confused. Until I can get some assistance, all I can do is take it one day at a time and pray for some miracle’s.  We are just a family trying to get by paycheck to paycheck, and it has been so hard on only Robert‘s income with all the medical bills.

Our Family thanks each and everyone of you from the bottom of our heart.

<h3>SUPPORTING WOUNDED U.S. MILITARY MEMBERS THROUGH CYCLING REHABILITATION</h3>
<p>Team 4Mil has been supporting wounded veterans for the past 4 years. We find, coach and mentor those able and interested in training and competing in the annual Race Across America bicycle race. This ultimate challenge of endurance gives them something to work for and provides them with the confidence to achieve anything in life despite the injury they have.</p>
<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/joe16a/8176475781/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""T4M_RAAM_Oceanside_Tara Roberts by b1kermaan, on Flickr""><img alt=""T4M_RAAM_Oceanside_Tara Roberts"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8481/8176475781_de7f27e055.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a>
<p>Team 4Mil was formed in 2009 by a group of former and active military members. We were approved as a 501 (c) (3) charitable organization October 8th, 2010. EIN: 27-3156634</p>
<p>Our mission from the start has been to use cycling as a means to help fellow wounded veterans rehabilitate from their injuries and return to a new normal in their lives. This way we do all we can to <strong>""Keep The Warrior Spirit Alive""</strong></p>
<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/joe16a/8176476617/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Racing by b1kermaan, on Flickr""><img alt=""Racing"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8208/8176476617_cf0862152c.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a>
<p>Your contributions will allow us to work with wounded veterans using cycling, nutrition and mentoring to assist them with their recovery. We culminate our efforts each year by entering and supporting an 8 man team of wounded veterans in the annual Race Across America. The 2013 race travels over 3000 miles from Oceanside California to Annapolis Maryland. The team race starts June 15th, 2013. We already have the 8 man team selected for the 2013 race. The only missing element now is the funding needed to equip, rehabilitate, train and support the team leading up to the race finish.</p>

<div>
<h3>How We Use The Charitable Donations We Receive</h3>
<p>We need a minimum of $150,000 to train and prepare an 8 man wounded team for the 2013 <a href=""http://www.raceacrossamerica.org/raam/raam.php?N_webcat_id=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Race Across America</a>. It takes $80,000 to pay the entry fee, transport crew, race team, and equipment to the start, feed the crew and racers for approximately 12 days, rent support vehicles to include fuel, and to transport equipment, racers, and crew back home after the finish. The remaining $70,000 is used for transporting and training crew and racers during 2 separate training camps prior to the race. This assumes racers have their own cycling equipment which isn't always the case. Should we get contributions that exceed the $150,000 dollar goal, we will work with cycling equipment companies and shops to provide as much gear for the racers as possible at discounted rates. Anything over and above what is needed for 2013 will be used for subsequent team efforts.</p>
<p>We want to reward those who contribute by offering what we can so you have memorabilia that shows you were an integral part of Team 4Mil succeeding in our mission.</p>
<p><a href=""http://team4mil.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Team 4 Mil Website"">Team 4Mil</a> actively seeks donations all year on our website. Should we only meet a portion of our goal here, it's hoped we can garner enough donations directly from our website. If you aren't able to contribute much or anything at all, we appreciate you spreading the word about our mission and driving traffic to our website. Thank you in advance for that!</p>

<h3>Inspiring Others</h3>
<p>Team 4Mil is made up entirely of volunteer current, former, and retired military members. 100% of the charitable donations we receive go toward funding our programs for supporting wounded veterans and their families. Some of the other ways your generous contribution can help includes :</p>
<ul>
<li>We continually strive to be a valuable resource for both the wounded veteran AND their families. Our feeling is the family members need and deserve our support as well. They sacrificed a lot and were at least fortunate enough to have their loved ones return home to them alive. As we garner more funding and recognition for all we do, supporting the families with other activities, nutritional counseling, mentoring and friendship will continue to grow and be something they can rely on their entire lives.</li>
<li>Team 4Mil has developed a very successful program of rehabilative support utilizing cycling and the Race Across America. As our support network grows, we expect to be involved in other positive activities and programs. Our goal is to hold several events during the year where other American citizens can join the veterans and their families to enrich each other’s lives through competition, fun group activities, friendship and patriotism.</li>
</ul>
<p>Every dollar we receive is greatly appreciated and used in the most positive manner. We are one of the only veteran support organizations that can say 100% of your dollar goes toward funding programs that directly benefit wounded veterans and their families.</p>

<h3>Volunteers Needed</h3>
<p>We completely understand and respect that not everyone is in a position to contribute monetarily. During the Race Across America especially, we need a team of volunteers to be crew members that help get our racers safely across the country. To give you an idea of the types of jobs our volunteers do here are some examples</p>
<ul>
<li>Crew Chief - Runs the entire operation</li>
<li>Mechanic - Maintains equipment</li>
<li>Navigation</li>
<li>Communications</li>
<li>Food Prep</li>
</ul>
<p>Our most immediate need is for a treasurer who has financial training. We accept applications from non-military members as well. If you are interested in volunteering you can <a href=""mailto:joe.arnone@team4mil.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">E-Mail Us Here</a></p>

<h3><strong>Our Story</strong></h3>
<p>One Doctor. Twenty nurses. A population of twenty four thousand. One Village.</p>
<p>It only takes nine to make a difference. Nine nurses working together to bring change to Worawora, Ghana and their health care. We are asking for your help to make our vision attainable. </p>
<p>Our mission began with PACE Ghana, one man's dream to empower his home country, by bringing awareness, recources, and opportunities. As undergraduate and graduate Registered Nurses, we feel the importance of globally practicing our skills for those in need. This January we are going to travel to Ghana, donating equipment, education, and nursing care.</p>
<p>We are going for two and a half weeks, not only to volunteer in the hospital, but also by making house calls, re-building a collapsed kindergarden school, working in the library, and encouraging health prevention. By this inital journey, we hope to create connections to facilitate Worawora in building their own nursing school.</p>

<p>The cost to each student is approximately $3,000. Not only do we want to decrease the cost of the trip, but also be able to raise enough to donate money and supplies to the community.

<p>The hospital in Worawora, use to be one of the upmost respected hospitals in the country. Unfortunately after the nursing school closed, the hospital crumbled with it.

($15), an iron stand ($7), manual labor ($5), and soap and water throughout the
school year ($3)—a cost the school will budget for the following year. A four per
cent fee for indiegogo has also been factored into the budget.
If our goal of $500 isn't met to build 12 washing stations
by May 27, we’ll take as much money as we can and build as many stations as
possible. 
Please follow my Facebook or twitter for updates on the
project post May---www.facebook.com/MissToriRose or @VictoriaVoyager
Even one water station at $40 can spare 50 students from disease
just because they’ll have an opportunity to wash their hands. 
Don’t forget share this project with your friends and
family! If each one of your Facebook friends gave $.50, we’ll reach our goal by
Friday!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>Our names are Rob Assibey and Fred Afari and we have been living in the Los Angeles area for most of our lives. We have seen first hand the poverty that exists and the lack of healthcare available to the communities of Los Angeles County. We currently work at a charter school in Los Angeles and teach students, who themselves lack health care. Something as simple as getting a physical is a task for them, and it would be fulfilling if we could help change that.</p>
<p>We are both very interested in the medical field and have a passion to make a difference in our community. Being former EMTs and serving in Los Angeles County we witnessed first hand how those without health insurance have suffered. We have estabilshed a non-profit organization with the goal of opening a free community medical clinic in order to service those that are without affordable health care. We have already started teaching discounted CPR classes in the community. We also plan to continue teaching the classes after the clinic is opened. Not only do we want to help our community with affordable health care we also want to increase health awareness as much as possible.</p>
<p>Those of you who contribute will not only help us achieve our goals but will also be chief contributors in the lives of all of the patients our clinic will see. Every single one of you will play an important role in the health of the less fortunate.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have found a location for our clinic to be operated in, unfortunately it is just an open box that needs to be converted into a medical clinc. The money that we receive will go towards the following:</p>
<p>Dry wall for our examination rooms</p>
<p>Plumbing for the sinks that need to be placed in the examination rooms</p>
<p>Electrical wiring</p>
<p>Initial staffing of employees</p>
<p>Rent </p>
<p><span>This is a flexible funding campaign (meaning, we get funded regardless of whether we hit our goal or not). Helping us to open up this community clinic is no small feat. We would appreciate every bit of your help. Your contributions also come with some cool perks, if you glance over to the side bar at the right!

Report on the Hemisphere (WRH), our website publications, interviews on
television and radio (including BBC, Al-Jazeera, The NY Times, and the
Washington Post), and interactions in the field and behind the scenes with
policymakers, we seek to shape continental policy toward the promotion of

the Council on Hemispheric Affairs was born from the love and passion that
founder and longtime director Larry Birns holds for the affairs and people of
the Americas. Along with our fearless leader, COHA is run by a passionate and
motivated family of researchers. Our intern program forms the backbone of COHA.
Each year we host around 60 undergraduate and graduate students who volunteer
their time for a 14-week period. All interns fill the position of Research
Associate, and are tasked with researching and writing articles for our publications.
In addition to their productive responsibilities as Research Associates,

Up until last year, Warmi provided medical insurance for its beneficiaries, to cover everything from emergencies such as that of Máxima to routine dental and doctor visits. Due to funding shortages, however, we have been unable to continue this service.<br/>For just 15 bolivianos per child per month -- that's about $2 -- you can help us make sure that the children of Warmi are insured and that no medical hardship is too heavy to bear.

Hasta el año pasado, Warmi proveyó seguro médico para sus beneficiarios, para cobrar todo, desde cirugía a visitas al dentista. Debido a una falta de dinero, desafortunadamente, ya no podemos ofrecer este servicio.<br/>Para sólo 15 bolivianos cada mes por niño, usted puede ayudarnos a asegurar que cada niño en Warmi tiene recursos en caso de que haya emergencia.

We at Warmi held a fundraiser for Máxima, and are happy to announce that she is on the road to recovery.However, it is our hope that in these situations of need, rather than desperately looking for outside funding at the last minute, parents will be able to rest easy knowing that they can provide basic medical care for their children. Up until last year, Warmi provided medical insurance for its beneficiaries, to cover everything from emergencies such as that of Máxima to routine dental and doctor visits. Due to funding shortages, however, we have been unable to continue this service.For just 15 bolivianos per child per month -- that's about $2 -- you can help us make sure that the children of Warmi are insured and that no medical hardship is too heavy to bear. From all the children and families at Warmi, thank you.Quienes SomosEl Centro Integral Warmi es una institución sin fines de lucro que provee servicios sociales en vista de ofrecer un desarrollo integral a los niños, niñas, y adolescentes con necesidades en la ciudad de Cochabamba.Desde nuestro incipio en 1982, hemos soportado a dos mil niños, rescatándolos de la calle y dándolos una oportunidad para recibir comida, educación, y protección. Por nuestro trabajo, los padres y madres pueden ir a trabajar sin preocuparse sobre sus hijos, promoviendo un ambiente en el hogar más seguro y fortalecido. Nuestro trabajo ayuda a evitar la violencia doméstica, empoderar a las mujeres, y promover la erradicación de la pobreza.Por Qué Necesitamos Su AyudaEl otoño pasado, cuando Máxima, una beneficiaria de Warmi, sufrió quemaduras de tercer grado por un fuego en la cocina, sus padres no podrían pagar sus cuentas médicas y tenían que pedir ayuda de la comunidad. Felizmente, tenían éxito, y ahora Máxima se está recuperando.Sin embargo, aquí en Warmi esperamos que en situaciones de emergencia, en vez de desesperadamente buscando ayuda, los padres puedan tener confianza que pueden proveer seguro médico básico para sus hijos. Hasta el año pasado, Warmi proveyó seguro médico para sus beneficiarios, para cobrar todo, desde cirugía a visitas al dentista. Debido a una falta de dinero, desafortunadamente, ya no podemos ofrecer este servicio.Para sólo 15 bolivianos cada mes por niño, usted puede ayudarnos a asegurar que cada niño en Warmi tiene recursos en caso de que haya emergencia. Desde todos a Warmi, mil gracias.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hello, My name is Dr. Jean Charles. I practice emergency medicine in Long Island, NY. I am teaming up with my wife Dr. Karen Isaacs-Charles and colleagues to conduct a medical mission to Guyana. The theme of the mission is to ""Give Back"". My wife was born in Guyana  and immigrated to the U.S. with her parents when she was very young. This project is her brainchild. This will be her first return trip to Guyana in 21 years and we would want it be a home coming of thanksgiving and celebration. Thus, we formed our Health and Wellness Medical Team which consists of health care proffesionals. We are planning a two day health clinic on April 3rd and 4th for the Seafield Village West Coast Berbice residents. All neighborhing towns are also invited.  Part of the mission will be to screen for diabetes, hypertension, and skin diseases. We will also perform medical physicals and initiate treatment. Our nutrionist/health coach will provide a holostic approach to patient care. We also plan to donate medical supplies to the Davis Memorial Hospital for their hospitalized patients. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> The theme of our organization is ""Health and Wellness"".  We believe that your health is your most cherished asset. This trip is more than providing medical service to people that probably have not or lack the ability to see a physician regulargy. This trip is more than us using our God given talents to help those in need. This trip is more than us taking our three children and exposing them to what it means to give back. This Campaign is about doing the good work of the Lord. We can each do our small part. Community service can start in your home/neighborhood, and in this case in another continent.  What path will you choose. We also hope that this can inspire you to start your own campaign for helping others.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What can You do to help?</h3>
<p>This project has grown from our original plan of going to Guyana to provide basic health screening. The mission trip has actually blossomed to providing complete screening/physicals and medical treatment initiation for  residents. We have already purchased the medicines and  supplies with no help from any organizations. However it is costly to completely finance such an endeaver on our own. We need the necessary funds to ship 29 boxes with a combined weight 435lbs to Guyana via air. Our Goal is to raise $2,500.  This will help us with the cost of sending the medical supplies. It will also go along way in securing transportation for our team once we arrive in Guyana. The Village is about a 2 hour drive from the capital. We will need to retain the service of a personal driver/guide during our stay.  A personal guide is key since we will be going back and forth between the capital and the villages providing our services. You can be confident that 100% of your donations will go towards helping the Guyanese people.  We are doing this because we care and want to give back. All donations are appreciated. </p>

<h3>My beloved cousin Brenda Akers has always been the most incredibly caring, loving person with lots of giggles.  Throughout her life she has created fundraisers for others' needs and now she needs help.  The local Moose Lodge is attempting to raise $5000 in a proving account for the anit-rejection drugs.  They must prove to the Transplant Organization that there is a beginning balance of $5,000 to cover the beginning rejection drugs.  She has been on disability for some time now but the new medicare rules will not pay for these drugs.  In addition, the new medicare rules no longer pays the total cost of dialysis to keep her alive until the transplant.  Her bill for these treatments now exceeds $1000.  She has medical bills mounding into the thousands.  We are setting a goal of $30,000 to be placed in an account that can only be paid to medical expenses.  I can't say how much longer her body will hold out but I was devastated when I saw her condition.  Please help me help her, so that the medical field will proceed in saving her..... and if you know anyone with A- blood ... she needs a kidney - a direct donor could save her.</h3>
<p>Those donating will be saving several lives, Brenda's and her children.  They have experienced losses this year and I am not sure they will endure the loss of their mother.  Her children are adults with children but they rely on her for moral support and have remained a very close family.  I will make sure that these funds are cared for and protected to be used for the intended purpose.  If you cannot contribute even a few dollars then please spread the word that we are looking for an A- donor and send the link to this site to as many people as possible.</p>

</div></div>","My beloved cousin Brenda Akers has always been the most incredibly caring, loving person with lots of giggles.  Throughout her life she has created fundraisers for others' needs and now she needs help.  The local Moose Lodge is attempting to raise $5000 in a proving account for the anit-rejection drugs.  They must prove to the Transplant Organization that there is a beginning balance of $5,000 to cover the beginning rejection drugs.  She has been on disability for some time now but the new medicare rules will not pay for these drugs.  In addition, the new medicare rules no longer pays the total cost of dialysis to keep her alive until the transplant.  Her bill for these treatments now exceeds $1000.  She has medical bills mounding into the thousands.  We are setting a goal of $30,000 to be placed in an account that can only be paid to medical expenses.  I can't say how much longer her body will hold out but I was devastated when I saw her condition.  Please help me help her, so that the medical field will proceed in saving her..... and if you know anyone with A- blood ... she needs a kidney - a direct donor could save her.
Those donating will be saving several lives, Brenda's and her children.  They have experienced losses this year and I am not sure they will endure the loss of their mother.  Her children are adults with children but they rely on her for moral support and have remained a very close family.  I will make sure that these funds are cared for and protected to be used for the intended purpose.  If you cannot contribute even a few dollars then please spread the word that we are looking for an A- donor and send the link to this site to as many people as possible.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>        The mission of <em>Positive Sport Coaching</em> is to educate and encourage positive attitudes and behaviors in all athletic events by coaches, parents, administrators, media, fans and players. </p>
<p>        <em>Positive Sport Coaching</em> is a non-profit (501 (c) 3) founded in 1993.  At present, over 8,609  coaches and 1,343 parents have received training and certification from <em>Positive Sport Coaching</em>. Roughly translated, that is over 96,881 young athletes per year who benefit in positive ways as a result of their coaches and parents training by<em> Positive</em> <em>Sport Coaching</em>.  However, it is important to note that less than 1% of the three million coaches in the United States receive any type of coaching education.  Training, and the means to provide it, is critically needed.</p>
<p>      <em>Positive Sport Coaching</em> educates individuals on the importance of respect, non-discrimination, the fun aspects of sport, and the satisfaction of doing one's best.  Our programs continue to fulfill the critical need for education in youth sports.  Coaches of sport are teaching our youth valuable life lessons. Participation in sport helps the young person build positive self-expression, a strong work ethic, morals and cooperation through team building.  The <em>Positive Sport Coaching</em> programs include sports philosophy, motivation, skills, health, nutrition, management and abuse recognition and prevention.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Factual studies about sports abuse:</p>
<p>45.3% of young athletes surveyed said they have been called names, yelled at while playing sports</p>
<p>21.5% said they have been pressured to play with an injury</p>
<p>17.5% said that they have been hit, kicked or slapped by a coach</p>
<p>3.4% said they have been pressured into sex or sexually molested</p>
<p> (Minnesota Amateur Sports Commission)</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>     A major barrier in solving the problem of abuse is that many coaches are not clear what behaviors constitute maltreatment of abuse.  Most recognize that behaviors once considered by many to be acceptable are now considered to be racist, sexist, harassing, or abusive.  No wonder coaches are confused about not only what not to do, but what to do.  When the people who should be guiding young athletes are emotionally, physically, or sexually abusive, a hostile and destructive environment can occur.  This can erode self-esteem, confidence and trust not only by the players, but by parents as well.</p>
<p>    </p>

<h3>Our Goals and Objectives</h3>
<p>    We have the programs in place and they are fine tuned.  It's time to get the message out to the three million plus coaches and 26 million sport parents.  You can help with this important message with your contribution.  Positive Sport Coaching has a plan to broadcast this valuable information and training to the schools, clubs and recreation centers in the United States.  Includes the parents, coaches administrators and the young athlete.     All these organizations have a legal responsibility to prevent and eliminate sports abuse from there programs.</p>

<p>Iloveme was founded in 2011 by Anne Pasdeloup, because she noticed a big gap in the health care system for people that
have minor or mild psychological problems. Often friends and family asked her
questions about their psychological health, because they didn't know where to
go, where to find the right information, or they didn't feel comfortable to visit a doctor yet. Anne is set on making this systeem more accessible and improving it by providing a service that gives people with mild psychological problems accurate information. That way, people will be able to form their own opinion and
start working on their problems before visiting a healthcare professional. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Anne</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> asked her former study
friends Eva Faas and Anouk Hövels to join her working on this project. Read about their personal motivations below.</span></p><p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/245320/files/20131206025247-Screen_Shot_2013-12-06_at_10.59.27_AM.png?1386327167"" src="""" style=""""/></b><br/></p><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><p><i>From left to right: Eva, Anne &amp; Anouk.</i></p><p><b></b></p><p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>OUR TEAM</b></b><br/></p><p></p><p><b>Eva Faas, Chief Editor</b>:</p><p><i>Having worked with mainly young adults the past years, I have seen the amount of problems shame and a lack of knowledge concerning psychological disorders and effective treatments can cause. Many of my clients should have received treatment at an earlier stage, but the taboo resting on psychological illnesses kept a lot of them from seeking help. Some of them did ask for help in the past, but received ineffective treatment or didn’t feel comfortable with their psychologist. Unaware that there are different kinds of treatments and disillusioned by the experience, they did not try again.</i></p><p><b>Anne Pasdeloup, Founder</b>:</p><p><i>While working in a Psychiatric Hospital, I quickly realized how dependent people with mental problems are on healthcare professionals. Most of our clients were already experiencing feelings of hopelessness, and felt unable to help themselves, before they sought our help. I want to change this. I want to let everybody know that they CAN change their own situation, that they are not victims and can help themselves. That is why I founded Iloveme, and created an app to empower people around the world.</i></p><p><b>Anouk Hövels, Text Writer</b>:</p><p><i>During my work I discovered that children and adults are the same in many ways. What fascinates me, is the ability of children to learn quite complicated things in a short period of time when the subject is presented in a funny, adventurous or exciting way. Once people grow up, the same methods remain effective. Think about writing in a diary or having a laugh with friends; activities many people use to actively cope with challenges in everyday life. More important, it gives them a better understanding of themselves. Iloveme offers a professional way of mental support. I am convinced that the positive and playful way of presenting it makes the app appealing and therefore powerful for many people.</i></p><p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">BACKGROUND</b><br/></p><p><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></i></p><p>About 1 in 5 adults suffer from a mental disorder. An even larger group
of people suffer from mental problems that haven’t turned into a disorder yet.
In fact, 50% of the population will experience some mental problems over their
lifetimes. 40% of these people never seek for treatment. The main reasons for
not doing it, are that people cannot afford te costs of health care,
they feel too ashamed, don't want others to find out, they
don't know where to go for help and they experience a lack of time. <span>By not treating mental problems it will take a lot longer
for them to disappear (if ever) and with time, the chance of problems getting worse
increases. Anne, Eva and Anouk have been doing research and
working diligently in order to create an accessible questionnaire and content
for the app. </span></p><p><b>WHY LOVEME ? </b></p><p>By using an app for coping with problems
our aim is offering an appealing way of supporting people. We chose for a mobile app because we think it is good way to interact with others and to keep track of thoughts and feelings at all
times. It fits the aim of becoming more aware of feelings and behaviour, to let people change their own behaviour and give and receive support of others. Iloveme distinguishes itself in comparison with other websites and apps by
focussing on empowerment. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The idea for a mobile application for Iphone and Android provides easy accessible and practical information. It offers people with mental problems the opportunity to actively work on their own psychological wellbeing.</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> It's also based on effective methods
in preventing mental problems from becoming
worse and </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">improving quality of life. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The app uses three important pillars of
treatment: Psycho-education by integrating a library with information of all
kinds of problems, a mood diary and offering a forum to increase the support
system. </span></p><p>

For all of you that still want to fund us, please do so on sellanapp. And the added bonus for funding us here, is that you'll receive a revenue share. So, come help us out! And last but not least, like us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Ilovemeapp to get daily updates on how to work actively on your own mental health.We love you!Eva, Anouk and AnneWHO IS IlOVEME?
Iloveme was founded in 2011 by Anne Pasdeloup, because she noticed a big gap in the health care system for people that
have minor or mild psychological problems. Often friends and family asked her
questions about their psychological health, because they didn't know where to
go, where to find the right information, or they didn't feel comfortable to visit a doctor yet. Anne is set on making this systeem more accessible and improving it by providing a service that gives people with mild psychological problems accurate information. That way, people will be able to form their own opinion and
start working on their problems before visiting a healthcare professional. Anne asked her former study
friends Eva Faas and Anouk Hövels to join her working on this project. Read about their personal motivations below.From left to right: Eva, Anne & Anouk.OUR TEAMEva Faas, Chief Editor:Having worked with mainly young adults the past years, I have seen the amount of problems shame and a lack of knowledge concerning psychological disorders and effective treatments can cause. Many of my clients should have received treatment at an earlier stage, but the taboo resting on psychological illnesses kept a lot of them from seeking help. Some of them did ask for help in the past, but received ineffective treatment or didn’t feel comfortable with their psychologist. Unaware that there are different kinds of treatments and disillusioned by the experience, they did not try again.Anne Pasdeloup, Founder:While working in a Psychiatric Hospital, I quickly realized how dependent people with mental problems are on healthcare professionals. Most of our clients were already experiencing feelings of hopelessness, and felt unable to help themselves, before they sought our help. I want to change this. I want to let everybody know that they CAN change their own situation, that they are not victims and can help themselves. That is why I founded Iloveme, and created an app to empower people around the world.Anouk Hövels, Text Writer:During my work I discovered that children and adults are the same in many ways. What fascinates me, is the ability of children to learn quite complicated things in a short period of time when the subject is presented in a funny, adventurous or exciting way. Once people grow up, the same methods remain effective. Think about writing in a diary or having a laugh with friends; activities many people use to actively cope with challenges in everyday life. More important, it gives them a better understanding of themselves. Iloveme offers a professional way of mental support. I am convinced that the positive and playful way of presenting it makes the app appealing and therefore powerful for many people.BACKGROUNDAbout 1 in 5 adults suffer from a mental disorder. An even larger group
of people suffer from mental problems that haven’t turned into a disorder yet.
In fact, 50% of the population will experience some mental problems over their
lifetimes. 40% of these people never seek for treatment. The main reasons for
not doing it, are that people cannot afford te costs of health care,
they feel too ashamed, don't want others to find out, they
don't know where to go for help and they experience a lack of time. By not treating mental problems it will take a lot longer
for them to disappear (if ever) and with time, the chance of problems getting worse
increases. Anne, Eva and Anouk have been doing research and
working diligently in order to create an accessible questionnaire and content
for the app. WHY LOVEME ? By using an app for coping with problems
our aim is offering an appealing way of supporting people. We chose for a mobile app because we think it is good way to interact with others and to keep track of thoughts and feelings at all
times. It fits the aim of becoming more aware of feelings and behaviour, to let people change their own behaviour and give and receive support of others. Iloveme distinguishes itself in comparison with other websites and apps by
focussing on empowerment. The idea for a mobile application for Iphone and Android provides easy accessible and practical information. It offers people with mental problems the opportunity to actively work on their own psychological wellbeing. It's also based on effective methods
in preventing mental problems from becoming
worse and improving quality of life. The app uses three important pillars of
treatment: Psycho-education by integrating a library with information of all
kinds of problems, a mood diary and offering a forum to increase the support
system.

EFFECTIVE  1. QUESTIONNAIRE
Imagine you haven’t been able to sleep for weeks. You might assume that
you are developing a sleeping disorder. But could it also be stress at work?
Have you been drinking less or more lately? Have you been travelling? Sometimes
it can be difficult to separate the original problem from all the different
symptoms that occur.
Our questionnaire is based on the DSM-V and covers the entire spectrum of
psychological disorders. It is developed to give a personal overview of which
categories are applicable to the user and indicates in which category the main
problems lies.2. LIBRARY
The extensive library contains information on psychological disorders,
provides a better understanding of how certain problems uphold each other and
gives usable tips and
tricks on how to deal with these problems. 3. MOOD TRACKER
The Mood Tracker will ask you to indicate your mood at random times and
to fill out where you are and what you are doing. Weekly, monthly and even yearly
charts will show mood fluctuations over time and helps you keep track of your
progress. 
Gaining more insight in your emotional state at different times
contributes to recovery by making clear what (external) factors are sustaining
the problem and which ones are part of the solution. 4. FORUM
The Iloveme forum contains subgroups
for the different problem categories, allowing the Iloveme
users to connect with peers and to give and receive advice and support
from each other within a save and
anonymous environment.

<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>The short version:</b> we are not happy with the teen skincare and acne treatments currently on the market. Many products in the beauty isle contain toxic chemicals that can lead to serious health problems that range from severe skin allergies, infertility, to cancer. There are many products that claim to be ""natural"" and ""green"", but our products actually back that up with ingredients derived from nature--all pleasantly packaged in our unique eco-friendly bottles.</span>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The real story, however, begins in South Africa when our Founder, Dr. Janine, lost a 9-year old patient to melanoma at one of her associated medical practices. When melanoma began to emerge in her own family, she realized the necessity of sun protection. Unfortunately, she found no products on the market appropriate for her own red-haired, at-risk teens. Thus, after considerable research and development, Screen debuted as the first ""teenceutical""--the progenitor of a product line that has expanded to include acne-treatments, facial cleansers, moisturizers. Yes, this means that our products help improve problem skin, but they also do what other, harsher products don’t: they keep skin healthy in the long-run. They have been specifically designed to nourish and protect the skin.</span></div>

<br/><ul><li>Most over-the-counter acne treatments, as well as skincare products, contain very harsh ingredients with potentially severe side-effects. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently released a consumer update warning that, ""...the use of certain acne products containing the active ingredients<b> benzoyl peroxide</b> or <b>salicylic acid</b> can cause rare but serious and potentially life-threatening allergic reactions or severe irritation."" Regulators stressed that these severe allergic reactions are much more serious than rashes and irritations often seen with skincare products. </li></ul>

<li>Unfortunately, this information has largely been suppressed or ignored by large corporations (e.g. brands like Proactiv, Neutrogena, and Aveeno).

Here at Teenceuticals LLC, the makers of the GR8SKN line, we are the ONLY company dedicated to developing natural chemical-free skincare products for teens through twenties. GR8SKN products are based on meticulous research and a vision that achieving clear and radiant skin can be simple, healthy, and even fun!
 Our FDA-Approved Products use only the finest natural ingredients derived from nature. Fight Breakouts Naturally! Our original formulas help fight breakouts and improve problematic skin without the use of toxic ingredients and preservatives, but they also accomplish what other, harsher products don’t: they keep your skin healthy in the long-run. Teen skin needs its own skincare, because it has its own set of unique requirements.
""Our products work with the skin, not against it, They are real products for real people"" - Dr. Janine 



What is Different About Our Ingredients?

At GR8SKN, we use only the healthiest all natural ingredients in our products: 

We are the only teen line on the market that uses probiotics and a fat-soluble form of triple Vitamin A, which is used in prescription acne treatments. Our night treatment, RESET, uses a gentler dose to help improve your complexion without damaging the skin. 

Tea Tree Oil is an essential oil that contains many therapeutic uses. It works as an antibacterial and antifungal that can help destroy the bacteria involved in the development of acne. It has benefits over benzoyl peroxide - it results in less itching, scaling, and irritation


Willow Bark works as a natural exfoliant that has the ability to help shed dead skin cells and clear pores. It also stimulates new cell formation.
Our products also contain Mandelic Acid (made from almonds) that is an effective antibacterial and increases cell turnover in the pores. And Vitamin C - essential for helping to prevent acne scarring, the production of collagen, and powerful antioxidant that works as a natural sunscreen.

Antioxidants help prevent cellular damage and  they neutralize and eliminate free radicals!
At GR8SKN, one of our core beliefs is offering full transparency of our selective ingredients. We are very proud to list EVERY ingredient that goes into each of our products. 
For more info about our ingredients go to gr8skn.com/our-products/or just shoot us an e-mail!



Teenceuticals is unlike any other company: our biggest goal is to become the most prominent health brand for young adults. Not only do we offer them safe and natural products, we foment health awareness by encouraging young adults to read labels, shop mindfully, and avoid toxic ingredients.  We see ourselves as the ""antidote"" to large corporations who prioritize profit over the health of their customers. 

Our campaign isn't just about the money, we also want to help: So we have decided to donate 5% of the funds we raise to Campaign for Safe Cosmetics - they are a broad-based coalition working to clean up the beauty aisle through public advocacy and market campaigns designed to eliminate dangerous chemicals linked to cancer, reproductive harm and other adverse health impacts from cosmetics and personal care products.





Why Are We Doing This?




The short version: we are not happy with the teen skincare and acne treatments currently on the market. Many products in the beauty isle contain toxic chemicals that can lead to serious health problems that range from severe skin allergies, infertility, to cancer. There are many products that claim to be ""natural"" and ""green"", but our products actually back that up with ingredients derived from nature--all pleasantly packaged in our unique eco-friendly bottles.


The real story, however, begins in South Africa when our Founder, Dr. Janine, lost a 9-year old patient to melanoma at one of her associated medical practices. When melanoma began to emerge in her own family, she realized the necessity of sun protection. Unfortunately, she found no products on the market appropriate for her own red-haired, at-risk teens. Thus, after considerable research and development, Screen debuted as the first ""teenceutical""--the progenitor of a product line that has expanded to include acne-treatments, facial cleansers, moisturizers. Yes, this means that our products help improve problem skin, but they also do what other, harsher products don’t: they keep skin healthy in the long-run. They have been specifically designed to nourish and protect the skin.

Most over-the-counter acne treatments, as well as skincare products, contain very harsh ingredients with potentially severe side-effects. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently released a consumer update warning that, ""...the use of certain acne products containing the active ingredients benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid can cause rare but serious and potentially life-threatening allergic reactions or severe irritation."" Regulators stressed that these severe allergic reactions are much more serious than rashes and irritations often seen with skincare products. 

Unfortunately, this information has largely been suppressed or ignored by large corporations (e.g. brands like Proactiv, Neutrogena, and Aveeno). Our products are effective without the need to use these harsh active ingredients that can cause severe allergies. NONE of our products contain benzoyl peroxide (BPO) or salicylic acid.

Watch this eye-opening video! Most people have repeatedly heard about the risks and dangers of UV radiation and skin cancer, but it isn't until we actually SEE the sun damage that we truly acknowledge this threat:






Skin Cancer Preventative Measures

A new study published in the American College of Physicians’ Annals of Internal Medicine (released June 3, 2013) is the first research in humans to show conclusively that sunscreen can help prevent photoaging (premature aging caused by the sun). 

While there is an abundance of indirect evidence suggesting sunscreen has anti-aging benefits, this is the first clinical human trial to show it.

On top of creating a natural alternative line of products for teens, we believe that promoting skin health and creating more awareness around skin cancer prevention is crucial.







1 in 5 Americans will develop skin cancer in the course of a lifetime. That's a frightening statistic. 

One person dies of melanoma every 62 minutes.
Melanoma is the most common form of cancer for young adults 25-29 years old and the second most common form of cancer for young people 15-29 years old.

old. She has graduated the secondary school and for all her life she has been
working as a bookkeeper. She was considered as a cheerful, old woman who didn’t
expect any big changes in her life. While she was a carefree retired person,
she used to spend her time reading books, watching TV, listening to music from
the old vinyls and playing with her beloved dog Alan. Unfortunately, the huge
changes in her life were coming. Her eyesight were getting worse. <b>The doctors
diagnosed her with cataract in her right eye</b>. <b>Moreover, it was found out that
there is also a cornea damage in the same eye and it has to be immediately
transplanted</b>. Those two treatments – cornea transplantation as well as cataract
surgery may be done at the same time during one operation. She has been
enrolled for the surgery waiting list as soon as possible, but… there is a big
obstacle we have met with. In Poland, there is only one queue in which the
patients from the private and public hospitals are waiting for their turn to

more than <b>5000 people waiting for their turn</b>. Surgery is needed right away to save her right eye! What is more, recently, the left

<p>Alicia
tiene 80 años. Ha terminado la educación secundaria y toda la vida ha trabajado
como contable. Siendo una mujer entrada en años, Alicia era una persona  muy serena y alegre que no esperaba que su
vida cambiase.  Después de haberse jubilado,  pasaba
su tiempo libre de una manera modesta y agradable. Le gustaba leer, ver la
televisión, escuchar  la música reproducida
de los viejos discos de vinilo, pero, sobre todo, le gustaba jugar con su querido
perro – Alan.</p>
<p>No
obstatnte, poco a poco han ido apareciendo cambios en su comportamiento.  Su vista ha ido de mal en peor y <b>los médicos le han diagnosticado una
catarata en el ojo derecho. </b></p>
<p>Lo peor
es que transcurridas unas semanas, <b>le
han detectado una lesión en la córnea del mismo ojo y han acordado que un
transplante de córnea es imprescindible. </b></p>
<p>Ambas
operaciones quirúrgicas, es decir, el transplante de córnea y  la destrucción del cristalino opaco
(catarata) se realizan en una misma operación, por tanto la han inscrito en la
lista de espera para operarse... Aquí empiezan los problemas. A grandes rasgos,
consisten en que en Polonia hay solamente una lista de espera general para
todos los transplanstes de córneas, tanto para los pacientes provenientes de
hospitales privados, como los de públicos. </p>
<p><b>¡Más de 5000 personas esperan su
transplante de córnea, pero Alicia necesita el transplante urgentemente! </b>Por si fuese poco, su ojo izquierdo ha
empeorado<b> y allí también han
diagnosticado una catarata. </b></p>
<p>Como
primero se efectúa una operación del ojo que se encuentra en estado peor,
Alicia está amenazada por la ceguera total. Por tanto, todas las cosas que le
causaban alegría en la vida, para ella van a desaparecer. Su querido perro -
Alan fue acogido por sus vecinos, porque Alicia no era capaz de sacarlo a
pasear, la subida por la escalera se había convertido para ella en una verdadera
tortura. Muchas veces al salir con el perro, Alicia casi se cae por la escalera
salvada por la pared contra la que podía atenerse en el entresuelo bajo la
ventana. Además, su hombro derecho esta en mal estado desde hace años. </p>
<p><b>La única solución de los problemas de
Alicia es una operación quirúrgica urgente</b> que se realiza en los países como:
Alemania o Rebública Checa, la operación es muy cara. Solamente el tratamiento
quirúrgico del ojo derecho viene a costar 6500$ y Alicia no es capaz de
pagarlo. </p>
<p><b>Por tanto, nos dirigimos a todos para
pedir ayuda financiera para la operación de Alicia. Cada importe es para
nosotros muy importante, aunque sea muy poco. </b></p>
<p><b>¡Cada cantidad de dinero la aleja de
la ceguera!</b></p>

lubiła czytać, oglądać TV, słuchać muzyki ze starych płyt gramofonowych oraz
zabawę ze swym ukochanym psem Alanem! </p><p>Lecz
stopniowo zachodziły ogromne zmiany. Jej wzrok coraz bardziej się pogarszał, <b>lekarze zdiagnozowali wpierw zaćmę w jej
prawym oku</b>. A co gorsza z biegiem czasu w tym samym oku okazało się że jest
<b>uszkodzona rogówka która jest do
przeszczepu</b>. Oba zabiegi tj. przeszczep rogówki i usunięcie zaćmy wykonuje
się w czasie jednej połączonej operacji.  No i została zapisana na operację
oka, lecz....... I tu zaczyna się prawdziwy problem .</p><p>Polega
on na tym że w Polsce  jest jedna
ogólnokrajowa kolejka do przeszczepu 
rogówek dla wszystkich szpitali państwowych jak i prywatnych. </p><p>Na
przeszczep rogówki oka <b>oczekuje </b>w
kolejce ponad <b>5000 osób</b>. A operacja

radość życia , pies Alan musiał być oddany do 
znajomych gdyż wychodzenie z nim na spacer ,a co za tym idzie
pokonywanie schodów stało się niewykonalne!!!</p><p> Pani Alicja nie raz wychodząc z Alanem i nie
tylko wtedy ,wywróciła się na schodach zatrzymując się na ścianie pod parapetem
okna na półpiętrze klatki schodowej A prawy bark ma w złym stanie już od kilku
lat!!!!  </p><p><b> Jedynym wyjściem w tej sytuacji jest
pilne wykonanie operacji</b>, które jest możliwe ale tylko w sąsiednich krajach czyli Czechach lub
Niemczech oczywiście odpłatnie .Tylko na operację prawego oka jest to suma <b>6500$</b> która to suma jest kompletnie
poza finansowymi możliwościami panii Alicji .</p><p>  Zwracamy się więc do wszystkich o
wsparcie finansowe! Każda kwota jest dla niej ważna</p><p>  <b>Dosłownie każda suma</b> bo oddala ją od
trwałej ślepoty!!!</p><p>  <b>Dziękujemy za poświęcony nam czas jak i za darowiznę</b></p><p></p><table style=""width: 100%;""><tbody><tr>

ENGLISH  Ms Alicja is 80 years
old. She has graduated the secondary school and for all her life she has been
working as a bookkeeper. She was considered as a cheerful, old woman who didn’t
expect any big changes in her life. While she was a carefree retired person,
she used to spend her time reading books, watching TV, listening to music from
the old vinyls and playing with her beloved dog Alan. Unfortunately, the huge
changes in her life were coming. Her eyesight were getting worse. The doctors
diagnosed her with cataract in her right eye. Moreover, it was found out that
there is also a cornea damage in the same eye and it has to be immediately
transplanted. Those two treatments – cornea transplantation as well as cataract
surgery may be done at the same time during one operation. She has been
enrolled for the surgery waiting list as soon as possible, but… there is a big
obstacle we have met with. In Poland, there is only one queue in which the
patients from the private and public hospitals are waiting for their turn to
have a cornea surgery. Ms Alicja needs the surgery immediately but there are

dog, Alan, had to be given to her acquaintance because she was not able to look
after him anymore. The cataract is in advanced stage. Because of that, there
were situations in which Ms Alicja became injured – she fell over many times
during everyday activities or housework. Her right shoulder has been in a bed
condition for the last few years. The only solution is to perform an operation immediately.
It is possible in Czech Republic or Germany only. Ms Alicja needs 6500$ for the

Et malheureusement cette somme d’argent est complètement hors des possibilités financières de Madame Alicja.Nous nous addressons donc à tous qui pourraient nous aider à financer l’opération. Chaque somme d’argent est important pour nous parce qu’elle eloigne Madame Alicja de la cécité totale !Nous vous remercions pour votre temps et votre contribution !

POLISH  Pani
Alicja ma 80 lat Ma wykształcenie średnie a całe życie pracowała jako
buchalter. Była pogodną starszą kobietą , która nie oczekiwała już w swym życiu
większych zmian. Swój czas na emeryturze spędzała skromnie i przyjemnie Bardzo
lubiła czytać, oglądać TV, słuchać muzyki ze starych płyt gramofonowych oraz
zabawę ze swym ukochanym psem Alanem! Lecz
stopniowo zachodziły ogromne zmiany. Jej wzrok coraz bardziej się pogarszał, lekarze zdiagnozowali wpierw zaćmę w jej
prawym oku. A co gorsza z biegiem czasu w tym samym oku okazało się że jest
uszkodzona rogówka która jest do
przeszczepu. Oba zabiegi tj. przeszczep rogówki i usunięcie zaćmy wykonuje
się w czasie jednej połączonej operacji.  No i została zapisana na operację
oka, lecz....... I tu zaczyna się prawdziwy problem .Polega
on na tym że w Polsce  jest jedna
ogólnokrajowa kolejka do przeszczepu 
rogówek dla wszystkich szpitali państwowych jak i prywatnych. Na
przeszczep rogówki oka oczekuje w
kolejce ponad 5000 osób. A operacja
by uratować to prawe oko jest potrzebna
natychmiast! Jak by tych wszystkich nieszczęść było mało zaczął szybko
pogarszać się stan lewego oka:
zdiagnozowano tu też zaćmę!A
ponieważ najpierw wykonuje się operację na oku w gorszym stanie pani Alicji grozi już niedługo całkowita ślepota!!!!!  Tak więc wszystkie rzeczy które przynosiły
jej radość w życiu stają się już teraz niemożliwe Ostatnią
radość życia , pies Alan musiał być oddany do 
znajomych gdyż wychodzenie z nim na spacer ,a co za tym idzie
pokonywanie schodów stało się niewykonalne!!! Pani Alicja nie raz wychodząc z Alanem i nie
tylko wtedy ,wywróciła się na schodach zatrzymując się na ścianie pod parapetem
okna na półpiętrze klatki schodowej A prawy bark ma w złym stanie już od kilku
lat!!!!   Jedynym wyjściem w tej sytuacji jest
pilne wykonanie operacji, które jest możliwe ale tylko w sąsiednich krajach czyli Czechach lub
Niemczech oczywiście odpłatnie .Tylko na operację prawego oka jest to suma 6500$ która to suma jest kompletnie
poza finansowymi możliwościami panii Alicji .  Zwracamy się więc do wszystkich o
wsparcie finansowe! Każda kwota jest dla niej ważna  Dosłownie każda suma bo oddala ją od
trwałej ślepoty!!!  Dziękujemy za poświęcony nam czas jak i za darowiznę

anything in their daily routine! Life must continue as usual. They look after

women of Lango sub-region in Northern Uganda! </p>
<p>Lango Sub-region is one of the areas emerging from the over
20 years of civil war. During the war, the locals’ priority was just surviving
the war. Now that the war has ended, the priority has shifted to just surviving
the poverty that has engulfed the region. The people are mostly subsistence
farmers with little or no means of generating income. This means health issues
are not a priority.</p><p></p><p>Early this year, about 1,896 women from Lango sub-region;
from 3 out of the region’s 8 districts were very lucky to get a medical screening organized by
Isis-Women’s International Cross Cultural Exchange (WICCE). Although the main
focus of the exercise was to screen for cervical cancer, the medical team
screened for other issues as well. Of the women who were screened, 100 required
surgeries to remove cancerous cells; 30 showed early signs of cancer or
abnormal changes and 13 were positive with cervical cancer. However, equally
disturbing, after the screening, the medical team identified and treated the most common condition; <b>1,521 women (80%)</b>
had chronic <b>pelvic inflammatory disease
(PID)!</b> <b></b></p>
<p>According to the CDC, Pelvic
Inflammatory Disease is an infection of a woman’s reproductive organs. It is a
complication often caused by some STDs, like<a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/std/Chlamydia/default.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">chlamydia</a>and<a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/std/Gonorrhea/default.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">gonorrhea</a> though other infections that are not sexually
transmitted can also cause it. </p>
<p>If PID
is untreated, it may result in serious, life-threatening complications: </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Infection can spread
to the blood or to other parts of the body. </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>PID can result in the
rupture of the fallopian tubes.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>PID increases the risk
of ectopic pregnancy, a life-threatening condition, especially in this part of
the world.</p>
<p>Health
professionals in the region attribute the high rate of PID in this population to
a lack of affordable health care services in the region, compounded by a lack
of awareness and yet these women reported that they felt unwell at all times and
that these illnesses were affecting their abilities to work effectively in the
fields and at home.</p>
<p>It
may take several very aggressive interventions and multi-pronged approaches for
this region to get back on its feet but addressing health issues should be one
of the first steps towards getting this region to flourish. </p>
<p><b><u>The Project:</u></b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>The Lango Association of North
America (LAONA), a non-profit public charity in the USA, will undertake to extend
the health screening done earlier this year by Isis-Women’s International Cross
Cultural Exchange to all the women in Lango sub-region who were not screened
through the Isis-WICCE project. The main focus of this project will be on screening
the women for PID and providing treatment as necessary.  The Association will partner with major health
centres to provide for the screening and treatment.</p>
<p>The Association hopes to set
up women’s health education centres across the 8 districts when funding becomes
available so that the women, whether they are in the villages or in townships, have
access to information that will help them monitor and act immediately on the health
issues that concern them.  </p>
<p>The Association needs to raise
<b>US $50,000 </b>to fund this screening and treatment, where treatment is
necessary; and to provide for basic women’s health education across the
sub-region. </p><p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Other Ways you can help</b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">:</span><br/></p><p></p><p>We appreciate that not everyone can contribute but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p><ul>
