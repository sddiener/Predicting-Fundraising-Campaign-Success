<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are Third Eye Productions, a team of students based in Toronto that are producing a short film. Our team study at Ryerson University and are in our final year of studies, obtaining our Bachelor of Arts. Olly, Aviva, Will, and Alex have spent the spring and summer months developing and crafting a concept that we are very excited to bring to life.</p>
<p>We are producing a short film with a twist. High school student, Monroe, enters an alternate universe, and must learn to adapt to her new surroundings and discover the secrets that this world holds. You, the audience get to make Monroe's decisions for her, in this 'choose your own path' story. </p>
<p>This story is important to us, as we want to create a production that is both interactive and outside the norm, in regards to television/film production. We want to put the power in our audiences hands and create an experience that allows users to experience different endings and paths, every time they guide Monroe through the Visionary. </p>
<p>Any contribution is appreciated by our team, no matter the size of magnitude. With your help, you can help us students create our largest production yet, as we graduate University. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Our team needs to raise funds to assist in obtaining shoot locations and purchasing props/wardrobe. Due to being out of work for a lengthy period of time, while paying full price for tuition, we're in great need of financial assistance so that we can supply our cast with the wardrobe that we envision, decorate our set with the desired props and rent our locations to shoot our scenes.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By donating to our campaign, you will be assisting young students looking to create Canadian content. Our team has high ambitions to create film/television productions that are experimental, out of the box and encourage production in Canada. We aspire to create productions so that young Canadians like ourselves can be given the opportunity to find experience here, rather than have to move to the United States. We want the film/television industry to continue in Canada as it helps create more jobs, especially in more remote areas of the country. We're proud to have a diverse cast and crew of Canadians in our production and hope to continue creating opportunities for young media professionals like ourselves</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has proven to be a massive challenge in peoples day to day lives. Our team has had to attend classes from home and plan our production remotely. This has proven to be a massive hurdle and has slowed the production process down.</p>
<p>Despite this, we have learned to adapt to the many changes that this pandemic has brought, with our production being one of them. We have learned how to collaborate electronically, whether it be writing the script or brainstorming ideas for concept art, we have found a way. We don't plan on stopping now and have accepted that life has changed, and though challenging, we will create a production that we can look on and be proud of. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We recognize that you may not be able to donate to our production and that's ok! There are other ways that you can help us create our final production.</p>
<p>You can follow us on Instagram: @thevisi0nary_ and share our posts and stories. You can also help get our name heard by sharing our campaign through the Indiegogo share tools</p>
<p>We thank you for your help.</p>

<h3>Why Donate?</h3>
<p>We are looking to create TWO new projects for our TikTok @shadowtheshow. We are so appreciative of all of our followers and want to create videos just for them! We have been in the production industry for over 10 years and want to bring our experience to create an all-new made for TikTok drama series. </p>
<p>The way people watch content is constantly changing we believe the next place for scripted shows is TikTok. We want to give our fans that exclusive experience with these two projects!</p>
<p>The first project we would like to create is a Shadow The Show Reunion/Reboot episode. Where are Calli, Carver, and Shadow now 10 years later? Find out and with a special twist!</p>
<p>Our second project is a made for TikTok original drama series. What happens when the new kid in town is framed for a crime? Will he find who actually did it? What if it will hurt the ones he loves the most? Find out in our new drama series!</p>
<p>As far as we know this has never been done before and we want to do it especially for you, our followers!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>All of our funding will be going 100% to the production budgets for both projects. We are not looking to profit just make more content!</li>
<li>We want to do it right this time, with the right gear, sets, and costumes. We want high-quality entertainment for our Tik Tok followers.</li>
<li>Most importantly we can bring back the show that everyone has loved so much with some higher quality production values.</li>
<li>We want our audience to be involved! We will have Behind The Scenes content along the way and will be incorporating YOUR feedback!</li>
</ul>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>Unfortunately, Tik Tok doesn't pay as much as people think it does, and definitely not enough to make high-quality content. So, we must rely on our followers for funding for our next project.  </li>
<li>However, if all of our followers donated just $1 we would have enough funding to create BOTH projects!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>We are giving back!</h3>
<p>We first made Shadow when we were in High School and it completely shaped our careers today. We want to give back to current students interested in the production industry.</p>
<p>How are we doing this? We have added a perk for students in the New England area that can come to set on one of our projects and shadow (no pun intended) a professional in the position they are interested in. This is a great way to get hands-on experience in the field and learn from real professionals!</p>

<h3>JULIE IS BACK!</h3>
<p>The new season of <i><strong>21st Century Demon Hunter</strong></i> is almost upon us! Juliette Johannes (played by Chelsea LeSage) is a demon hunter from a long line of demons hunters, tasked with fighting the forces of darkness, but her goals in life revolve more around getting high, drunk, and laid. Unfortunately for Julie, there are some very ancient and powerful forces that are about to enter this world and her life in a very big way.</p>
<p>Written and directed by Charles D. Lincoln, with Season 1.5, which we have dubbed <i>#TheLincolnCut</i>, Julie is back with new misadventures, new enemies, and a few familiar faces! From vampires to a magical serial killer to ancient evils beyond the stars, there's so much awaiting her.  But since we wanted to do things extra special, this time, after the guerrilla filmmaking style of the first season, we went the extra mile and went full crew and a cast full of amazing actors. Returning from Season 1 are Rebecca Lauren (Stephanie), Casey Marie Ecker (Persephone), Madison Humes (Desiree), Matthew Carter (Mr. Allen), Kevin Ralston (Frederick Matherson), Anna Lynn Holmes (Enid Gardner), and Charles D. Lincoln as his <i>Theresa &amp; Allison</i> character, Tony. New additions to cast include NYC punk icon Tibbie X (of The X-Possible, GASH, and Reagan Youth), Marine Assaiante, Kerrys Virgo, Ian Schulz, Kasia Walczak,  Ilaria Malvezzi, Caitlin Ross-Poteet, Robert Abrams, Nikki Delmonico,, Jonathan Hartman, Alyssa Jo Mills, and many many more! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>AND ALL OF THAT IS DONE! SHOT! IN THE CAN! So, what do we need from you? Well...</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1629818281/gon5lg0d4dyxqswddzz7.png"" src=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>We are <strong>Charles D. Lincoln</strong> and <strong>Chelsea LeSage</strong> of<strong> C. L. Squared Productions</strong>, an NYC-based independent production company dedicated to making undiluted, unbridled, unhinged work, working together with the best independent cast and crew we can, to show that just because something is from a small company doesn't mean the quality has to be lacking.</li>
<li>On the heels of the release of the <i><strong>21st Century Demon Hunter</strong></i> novel (available from Burning Bulb Publishing), our first season, which is available now on Amazon Prime Video, was done with a point and shoot, guerrilla-style to emulate some of the lower budget films that influenced us, as well as capture the gritty NYC punk rock style of our anti-heroine. However, with bigger narrative stakes, we felt production should reflect that, so we went bigger. We worked with amazing D.P. Christopher Bye and makeup artist extraordinaire, Shannon Rae Mulligan, to make the new season of <i><strong>21st Century Demon Hunter</strong></i> darker, funnier, more disturbing than the first one. We dubbed this season 1.5, instead of 2, because first, it's only five episodes, whereas the first one was comprised of thirteen, and two, because it's a bit of a new beginning for us. </li>
<li>Production is done. All scenes are shot and edited. All score is composed. But a personal tragedy put a damper into our Post Production plans and now we turn to you, for help with finishing it up!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>WE NEED YOUR HELP TO COMPLETE IT!!</h3>
<p>So, what do we need from you?</p>
<ul>
<li>We need a total of $4,000 to complete post production. We need $2,000 for sound design from the very capable Evan Joseph, who worked with us, previously on our first feature, <i>Theresa &amp; Allison. </i>We need an additional $1,000 for VFX to spice up some scenes or fix things in the background we didn't realize were problems. And we need $500 to complete color correction. We've already begun it. As you can see, with these before and after pictures. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1629818631/flliwil4k8bodpsuwmmc.jpg"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1629818650/j74zf2j8niz1lj1ugzca.jpg"" src=""""/>Really, our goal is to get this looking and sounding as good as possible so that you, the viewer, can get the best five episodes possible! And on that note, we also need another $500 for subtitles in multiple languages, so that we can reach as big an audience as possible. </li>
<li>In exchange for your help, we're looking to give you some awesome perks! We are offering personalized shout outs, personalized memes, signed scripts, DVD's and Blu-Rays of the entire season, signed copies of the 21st Century Demon Hunter novel, the chance to have a private zoom Q&amp;A, lunch, and/or even play videogames with writer/director/producer Charles D. Lincoln and star/producer Chelsea LeSage, and for two lucky people, props from Season 1.5! If you give to us, we will give to you! </li>
<li>And if we don't get everything, well, we'll definitely miss our deadline and won't be able to release on Halloween with our new distributor, but we will still soldier on and pay out of pocket when the money comes to us. We'll still give you this season, but it will be way later than Halloween 2021.</li>
</ul>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The only real challenge at this point is funding. We have the people, we have the footage, we have a new distributor who only needs our finished copies. </p>
<ul><li>As we've said, everything else is done. The scenes have been shot, the score has been composed, the episodes have been edited. We just need to fix the quality of the visuals and the sound, as well as provide subtitles for various nations. With your generous contribution, we can achieve that. </li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<ul>
<li>Of course, if you can't  make a contribution right now, spread the word. Watch the first season on Amazon Prime and think of the potential behind it being shot professionally and realize that is what we achieved here.  Tell your friends. Tell your enemies. Tell everyone. Spread the word! The second coming of 21st Century Demon Hunter is upon us and with their help, we can give birth to something very very messed up! </li>
<li>You can also go to Amazon or Barnes &amp; Noble and pick up a copy of the 21st Century Demon Hunter novel, written by Charles D. Lincoln, today! </li>

""I'm good at this simulator, so I could easily fly a real fighter jet!""
We've all heard it before, right? Especially when a gamer beats a real pilot in virtual reality.
Instead of just rolling our eyes, what if we could actually put them to the test?
Mover Media and Etched Motion Productions have partnered with Victory Flight Training to do just that. We'll start by taking gamers and putting them in real jets (after a little bit of instruction from our hosts, of course) and find out who America's Next Top Dogfighter really is. 
We're creating a pitch/pilot of what will hopefully become a series taking people from various backgrounds and letting them (safely) fight it out over the skies of Texas in our Marchetti S-211 aircraft.

 

Meet the Hosts
C.W. LEMOINE 
""Mover""

Mover started his military flying career in the Air Force Reserve flying F-16s. After one thousand hours and a combat tour in Iraq, he transferred to the Navy Reserve flying F/A-18s. He later transferred back to the Air Force Reserve and is currently flying the T-38A as an adversary pilot.  He also flies for a legacy U.S. Airline.
When he's not flying, Mover is the host of the YouTube Channel ""C.W. Lemoine"" with over 300,000 subscribers. His show ""Mondays with Mover"" includes aviation breakdowns, interviews, and flight training videos. He is also the author of the SPECTRE SERIES and THE ALEX SHEPHERD SERIES
TREVOR HARTSOCK
""Gonky""

 
Gonky is a former Navy F/A-18 International Instructor Pilot. After leaving the Navy, he flew with the Malaysian Air Force as a Boeing Instructor Pilot. He later returned to the Navy Reserve where he met Mover flying Adversary F/A-18s in New Orleans. He has since transferred to the Air Force Reserve where he currently flies T-38As with Mover. He is also an Airbus A320 pilot.
When he's not flying, Gonky runs a real estate business and is the host of ""The Ready Room"" on YouTube. His channel has over 16,000 subscribers and features military aviation videos and interviews.

I started Bronx ish 5 years ago. Before I had representation, and before I was in the union. When I had to get all the auditions myself, and the ones I self submitted to frankly... some were cool, and some made me nauseous. I was tired of it.I remember watching GIRLS on HBO, and at the end of every episode .. it always said “Written &amp; Created by Lena Dunham.” I always got the chills, 1: because Adam Driver is handsome... (Danielle, focus), and 2: I said to myself - THAT’S what I want for ME.</p><p>I can write, and I can act in it… and here we are. </p><p>I’m a Soundview girl, forever and ever. I love being from the Bronx. My Grandma moved here when she was 14, alone. First Generation... and she is still living here to this day. My Pisces twin.</p><p>Ahh. NYC... when you can’t tell if that was a shootout or fireworks...but you know damn well it wasn’t fireworks. I love being from NY... our culture, and our energy. If you know... You know. There literally isn’t a cooler place to be from.</p><p>Sorry, not sorry.</p><p>Bronx ‘ish... is me. What makes it special, what gives you a headache... and all in between. As an Afro-Latina, living at home, and chasing a dream.. To say that doesn’t come with its share of ‘ish.. Is an understatement. The naysayers, the doubters, the “realistic” ones... They all have an opinion. 16 years later... I still listen to my voice. This Soundview girl will share her journey of coming up in the Bronx... To infinite possibilities and all the ‘ish… that comes with it! </p><p>See you at the top! </p><p>&lt;3 </p><p> danny.</p></div>","Mission StatementIn 2021, it is ever more important to elevate female voices and the voices of women of color.

Funding will go toward production expenses.""BRONX 'ISH"" SEASON 2 PRODUCTION EXPENSES$3000 -- Production Staff$2000 -- Cast$6500 -- Camera Crew & Rentals$1500 -- Make-up Crew$ 500 -- Props$1500 -- Sound Crew$2500 -- Locations Expenses          $17,500 -- TOTAL The ImpactFunding this project will provide an economic impact in both Bronx specifically and with the independent film community in New York City in general, which has been hit hard during the covid-19 pandemic.You will contribute to elevating the voices of creative black women and female filmmakers. You will support independent filmmakers and help marginalized voices find their platform. What if…?We would prefer to be able to pay everyone a reasonable day rate, but if we do not raise our entire goal, we will do our best to divvy the resources among the entire crew fairly. Our producer, Gillian Fritzsche, has experience producing and directing short projects and feature projects with budgets from $500 to $500,000. She is able to allocate funds properly and fairly to ensure a quality project is made. COVID-19 Production StandardsWe will be utilizing new industry standard covid-19 production protocols that have been developed by industry leaders over the past year. From smaller crews to safety standards, we will work to ensure that each person on our set remains healthy.

You can help make it happen! From the Creator:Hiiii!  I’m almost not even emotionally or mentally prepared that my little web series is growing up. I started Bronx ish 5 years ago. Before I had representation, and before I was in the union. When I had to get all the auditions myself, and the ones I self submitted to frankly... some were cool, and some made me nauseous. I was tired of it.I remember watching GIRLS on HBO, and at the end of every episode .. it always said “Written & Created by Lena Dunham.” I always got the chills, 1: because Adam Driver is handsome... (Danielle, focus), and 2: I said to myself - THAT’S what I want for ME.I can write, and I can act in it… and here we are. I’m a Soundview girl, forever and ever. I love being from the Bronx. My Grandma moved here when she was 14, alone. First Generation... and she is still living here to this day. My Pisces twin.Ahh. NYC... when you can’t tell if that was a shootout or fireworks...but you know damn well it wasn’t fireworks. I love being from NY... our culture, and our energy. If you know... You know. There literally isn’t a cooler place to be from.Sorry, not sorry.Bronx ‘ish... is me. What makes it special, what gives you a headache... and all in between. As an Afro-Latina, living at home, and chasing a dream.. To say that doesn’t come with its share of ‘ish.. Is an understatement. The naysayers, the doubters, the “realistic” ones... They all have an opinion. 16 years later... I still listen to my voice. This Soundview girl will share her journey of coming up in the Bronx... To infinite possibilities and all the ‘ish… that comes with it! See you at the top! <3  danny.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>If you want to bundle multiple Blu-Ray sets together instead of coming back later and buying another separately, It's easy! Just pick the Season 5 Blu-Ray perk, then at check out, you can choose to add season 1, 2, or 3 to your order for a <strong>discounted bundle deal</strong> that also saves on shipping! </p>
<p>Now, if you live overseas the bundle deal doesn' work out as well due to the way it adds the already crazy high shipping charges so we decided to offer you a <strong>special over-seas perk</strong> that has the proper discounted shipping total so you don't go broke! This is ONLY available over-seas fans. And remember, if you are only buying 1 or 2 Blu-rays you can still do it normally, this perk is ONLY if you are buying ALL the Blu-Rays.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We've talked about this before, but because we are not a big studio we can't afford to make thousands of these at once which keeps the material costs per unit lower. The reason the seasons 1-3 Blu-Rays are a little more is that we have no idea how many of you will want these. We have to think worst-case scenario and assume only printing out a few hundred of each. Otherwise, we may shoot ourselves in the foot and not have enough money to make them if we put the price we charge too low. It was the same issue with the Digi-books, but luckily not THAT expensive. And making 4 Blu-Ray sets will be a TON of work. I will have to hire help, so that cost has to be factored in. And I can't imagine us ever re-printing these again, more than likely these Blu-Ray runs will be the only run there is.  Plus, because we are producing 4 separate sets, each time you make a blu-ray you have to pay for licenses and expensive masters for each disc. And we will have 8-10 discs here with all these sets combined. So that cost has to be considered since, again,  we are not Disney and can't produce a million copies to make it cheap. </p>
<h2><strong>Why is the goal only $1000?</strong></h2>
<p>Well, this is a pre-order not a traditional crowdfunding campaign. I have to put some number. Obviously we want to sell as many sets as humanly possible. We gotta eat. And also pay off our movie debt..</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are <strong>Katy Schutte</strong> and <strong>Edmund Fargher</strong>, two improviser/writer/comedians living in London in the UK.</p>
<p>I'm Katy, an award-winning improviser who teaches and performs all over the world. I'm also a writer, actor and director with several solo shows, plays and a book to my name. This is Edmund, a TV and stage actor who in a previous life worked as an Assistant Director in film.</p>
<p>We found one another on the wonderful London improv circuit, creating hip-hop versions of fairy tales, maintaining 'serious' scenes while getting custard-pied and turning non-romantic movies (like Alien, Home Alone and Terminator 2) into rom coms.</p>
<p><strong>Sideliners</strong> is a brand new series written by us. It consists of ten, ten-minute episodes. ​The story is set against a romantic comedy, but instead of following the leads, we follow the oft-forgotten best friends; the Sideliners. We are super proud of our written work and we want to get it made to a professional standard. We want to make it our way, without having to compromise the work as we imagine it. This is the big one. The one we really care about.</p>
<p><strong>You can find out more about the series itself at <a href=""https://www.sidelinersseries.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.sidelinersseries.co.uk</a></strong></p>
<p>If we hit our target, we will film a top quality pilot as a launch pad to help us make the rest of the series. If contributions are larger than our dreams, then we can make even more episodes independently.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need <strong>£9,900</strong> to make our first high quality episode with cast and crew, filming over two, ten-hour days. We'll be using HD SLR cameras, pro audio recording and a crew (meaning me and Ed get to focus on performing).</p>
<ul>
<li>£2,000 Equipment hire for 2 days (lighting and grip kit borrowed where possible)</li>
<li>£6,400 Pro crew for 2 days (including scale-down crew and in-kind Producer and Director)</li>
<li>£0 Cast (in-kind support)</li>
<li>£400 Transport for 2 days</li>
<li>£200 Food for 2 days</li>
<li>£900 10% contingency (for anything that goes wrong or costs more than we budgeted)</li>
<li><strong>TOTAL £9,900</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Concessions to keep costs down:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will source lighting from friends and family.</li>
<li>Friends who work in the industry have offered to work for free because they have faith in us and in the scripts.</li>
<li>We have removed the Camera Assistant, Script Supervisor and Grip from the crew as these are super helpful people to have, but not essential for our shoot.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our perks:</p>
<p><i>All backers will be named on a shout-out video.</i></p>
<ul>
<li>We know that for some people the <strong>joy</strong> of supporting friends and/or a cool-sounding project is enough, so we made a perk for that (and we'll shout you out on film). (£10)</li>
<li>We're improvisers at heart and we know you like mementos, so we'll send you a <strong>postcard</strong> with a unique three-line scene improvised onto it by both of us. (£15)</li>
<li>Nothing's more fun than FOMO, so you get an exclusive invite to our very <strong>first screening</strong> in London, plus a secret special treat. (£20)</li>
<li>One of our first improv shows together was Pie-day Night, where one of us got pied in the face. Paying homage to our roots, we will make a video of one of us thanking you or a friend while <strong>getting</strong> <strong>pied </strong>in the face. Choose between me and Ed or pay twice to get us both. You also get a first screening invite. (£30)</li>
<li>
<strong>Merch</strong>, merch, merch. Get a lovely tee with our show branding on it, plus an exclusive London screening invite. (£45)</li>
<li>Double-up and get <strong>two</strong> tees and two screening invites. (£65)</li>
<li>Come and be a <strong>background artist </strong>in our pilot and hang out on set. You also get a tee and a first screening invite. (£75)</li>
<li>We'll have a one hour <strong>video chat </strong>online for up to ten people at a time. Ask me and Ed whatever you want; about us, about improv, about writing, or anything really. You also get a tee and a first screening invite. (£100)</li>
<li>Get a secret 45-minute <strong>improv show</strong> at your house, venue or improv night. We'll throw in a couple of tees and first screening invites too. (£500)</li>
<li>You like us and/or the project so much, you want to give us more. We will credit you in the show and you'll be invited to the first official screening as a <strong>VIP </strong>with up to nine friends. Plus up to ten branded tees. (£1,000)</li>
<li>
<strong>You're a legend</strong> because you've made a whole episode possible. You can have any or all of the perks above. Pie Ed as much as you want. (£10,000)</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">If we raise less than our goal, we'll still make the pilot, but every penny drives up the quality and a cheap pilot will look like a cheap pilot. Without a high standard pilot, we're unlikely to be able to make more than one episode in the long run.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">If we make more than £10,000 we will drive up the quality of our pilot and see if the money will stretch to make more episodes. </span></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We want you to be involved in our making process. It's exciting seeing something getting made, whether that's videos about how it's going, or filming on set with us. As improvisers, we love to see projects raw, in their infancy and we hope that's why you're here too. We believe that the polished, finished product will be a great contribution to the rom com oeuvre. We're picking the genre apart and adding a lot more down-to-earth humanity to it; where perhaps even us best friend types can be the stars.</p>
<p>We have tried and tested the scripts by bringing a team of writers and creatives together for our first table read, doing rewrites, then performing a 'live table read' with guest performers at Hoopla, our London improv home. We were thrilled to get such useful and positive feedback and inspired enough to make another draft that is even better. Right now we're really happy with the scripts.</p>
<p>We are both actors on stage and screen, with credits including Keith Lemon: Coming in America, BAFTA-winning series History Bombs, cult sensation Knightmare Live plus commercials, immersive theatre and such .</p>
<p>I was nominated for Best Comedy Show, writing and performing Schutte the Unromantic at Brighton Fringe in 2018. I collected a bunch of four and five star reviews for my touring folk-horror play Let's Summon Demons over the last year. I'm also a contributing writer for Cards Against Humanity.</p>
<p>Edmund is a TV and stage actor whose secret weapon is his previous life working as an Assistant Director in film. Between us, we have enough smarts, talent and experience to make this work.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There is always the chance that something will fall through, especially when we are counting on favours. In this case, we will rally to find help elsewhere and/or divert some of our funds to solve a problem.</p>
<p>As improvisers, we are both used to rolling with the punches. We have such a great support network of experienced creatives in our artistic community, we are sure we can pull the project together no matter what surprises and challenges we have to face.</p>
<p>Ed and I have a great working relationship through improvisation and performing together in scripted work for the stage, but we are new to film making as a duo. To allow us to do our best work on screen, we have enlisted an excellent production team so we can focus on performance without being distracted on set by the bigger project. </p>
<p>If we don't reach our entire goal, we will film anyway, reducing our budget by using less high-end kit and finding more crew and performers who are willing to work with us in kind. We really hope we can get to £10,000 and we think the project is more than worth it, but we will use whatever we raise to get a pilot made.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>
<p>If you're unable to contribute financially, we'd still love your help. If you can get the word out and make some noise about our campaign, that would help us no end.</p>
<p>If you have any expertise in film making or producing and think you could help us out, do get in touch and let us know.</p>

£2,000 Equipment hire for 2 days (lighting and grip kit borrowed where possible)
£6,400 Pro crew for 2 days (including scale-down crew and in-kind Producer and Director)
£0 Cast (in-kind support)
£400 Transport for 2 days
£200 Food for 2 days
£900 10% contingency (for anything that goes wrong or costs more than we budgeted)
TOTAL £9,900

Concessions to keep costs down:

We will source lighting from friends and family.
Friends who work in the industry have offered to work for free because they have faith in us and in the scripts.
We have removed the Camera Assistant, Script Supervisor and Grip from the crew as these are super helpful people to have, but not essential for our shoot.

Our perks:
All backers will be named on a shout-out video.

We know that for some people the joy of supporting friends and/or a cool-sounding project is enough, so we made a perk for that (and we'll shout you out on film). (£10)
We're improvisers at heart and we know you like mementos, so we'll send you a postcard with a unique three-line scene improvised onto it by both of us. (£15)
Nothing's more fun than FOMO, so you get an exclusive invite to our very first screening in London, plus a secret special treat. (£20)
One of our first improv shows together was Pie-day Night, where one of us got pied in the face. Paying homage to our roots, we will make a video of one of us thanking you or a friend while getting pied in the face. Choose between me and Ed or pay twice to get us both. You also get a first screening invite. (£30)

Merch, merch, merch. Get a lovely tee with our show branding on it, plus an exclusive London screening invite. (£45)
Double-up and get two tees and two screening invites. (£65)
Come and be a background artist in our pilot and hang out on set. You also get a tee and a first screening invite. (£75)
We'll have a one hour video chat online for up to ten people at a time. Ask me and Ed whatever you want; about us, about improv, about writing, or anything really. You also get a tee and a first screening invite. (£100)
Get a secret 45-minute improv show at your house, venue or improv night. We'll throw in a couple of tees and first screening invites too. (£500)
You like us and/or the project so much, you want to give us more. We will credit you in the show and you'll be invited to the first official screening as a VIP with up to nine friends. Plus up to ten branded tees. (£1,000)

You're a legend because you've made a whole episode possible. You can have any or all of the perks above. Pie Ed as much as you want. (£10,000)

If we raise less than our goal, we'll still make the pilot, but every penny drives up the quality and a cheap pilot will look like a cheap pilot. Without a high standard pilot, we're unlikely to be able to make more than one episode in the long run.
If we make more than £10,000 we will drive up the quality of our pilot and see if the money will stretch to make more episodes. 
 

The Impact
We want you to be involved in our making process. It's exciting seeing something getting made, whether that's videos about how it's going, or filming on set with us. As improvisers, we love to see projects raw, in their infancy and we hope that's why you're here too. We believe that the polished, finished product will be a great contribution to the rom com oeuvre. We're picking the genre apart and adding a lot more down-to-earth humanity to it; where perhaps even us best friend types can be the stars.
We have tried and tested the scripts by bringing a team of writers and creatives together for our first table read, doing rewrites, then performing a 'live table read' with guest performers at Hoopla, our London improv home. We were thrilled to get such useful and positive feedback and inspired enough to make another draft that is even better. Right now we're really happy with the scripts.
We are both actors on stage and screen, with credits including Keith Lemon: Coming in America, BAFTA-winning series History Bombs, cult sensation Knightmare Live plus commercials, immersive theatre and such .
I was nominated for Best Comedy Show, writing and performing Schutte the Unromantic at Brighton Fringe in 2018. I collected a bunch of four and five star reviews for my touring folk-horror play Let's Summon Demons over the last year. I'm also a contributing writer for Cards Against Humanity.
Edmund is a TV and stage actor whose secret weapon is his previous life working as an Assistant Director in film. Between us, we have enough smarts, talent and experience to make this work.

 
Risks & Challenges
There is always the chance that something will fall through, especially when we are counting on favours. In this case, we will rally to find help elsewhere and/or divert some of our funds to solve a problem.
As improvisers, we are both used to rolling with the punches. We have such a great support network of experienced creatives in our artistic community, we are sure we can pull the project together no matter what surprises and challenges we have to face.
Ed and I have a great working relationship through improvisation and performing together in scripted work for the stage, but we are new to film making as a duo. To allow us to do our best work on screen, we have enlisted an excellent production team so we can focus on performance without being distracted on set by the bigger project. 
If we don't reach our entire goal, we will film anyway, reducing our budget by using less high-end kit and finding more crew and performers who are willing to work with us in kind. We really hope we can get to £10,000 and we think the project is more than worth it, but we will use whatever we raise to get a pilot made.
 

Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:

<p><i>We, Thee Delinquents</i> is a Canadian teen drama series that follows French immersion students of Lady of Mercy Catholic High School. It’s a darker, grittier and lively look into life as these Gen Zer’s battle with issues of racism, sexuality, drugs and mental health. Watch as these Canadian teenagers navigate the hardships of growing up.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>THE STORY</strong></p>
<p>The story is set in Etobicoke, one of the many boroughs of Toronto. The city is quieting down, leaves are changing colour and the students of Our Lady of Mercy Secondary are getting ready for a new school year. And with this change in weather, comes a change in attitude for the people of the city. And with changes, come new beginnings. Especially for Kiyanna Fuller. A reformed juvenile who will have to repeat grade 11. Integrating into a new high school definitely won’t be easy and finding a sense of normalcy is all Kiyanna wants. Enlisted to help her settle in is Student Council President, Ana Pacheco. A well-rounded student and an academic god, who’s own pressures of school success in getting the better of her. Coupled with her own fractured friendships, especially with ex BFF, Samantha Russo, an ‘IT’ girl battling her own insecurities while maintaining her perfect image. With a mountain of secrets, raging hormones and finding their own footing, more connect these young ladies than ever before and the cliques that they run in.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>WHY THIS PROJECT</strong></p>
<p>Everyone knows that<i> Degrassi: The Next Generation</i> is our national treasure. <i>Degrassi</i> gave Canadian teens a sense of identity, that I never really appreciated until now. And I believe that's something we desperately need for the next generation. In the last two years, there have been open dialogues all around the world about the various social injustices taking place. There’s always been these perceptions that Canada is this nice, quiet country with no problems. Unfortunately, that isn’t that case. I along with many others, have experienced police brutality, racism, sexism, homophobia, colourism etc. For me, this series is not just about reflecting or identifying life as a Canadian teen, but I believe it is my duty as a filmmaker to reflect on the times. When writing <i>We, Thee Delinquents</i>, it was very important for me to represent characters from different races, cultures, and with different sexualities and socio-economic backgrounds. There are so many truths from people I grew up with that haven’t been told on a media platform and they deserve to be. Having it be set in a catholic French immersion high school is as Canadian as it gets. As we also haven’t had the opportunity to explore the dynamics of a school with a French immersion program, one that is a very common element in the Canadian Education system. </p>
<p>In a way, this is my love letter to the yute of the past, present and future because you’re not alone. You are important, and your stories matter.</p>

Every season consists of twelve 24-minute episodes. The series is developed simultaneously in both English and Bulgarian, with the option for more languages.</p><p>We are telling a modern original story, set in the mystical world of Balkan legends. Our story bears the same heart, morals and lessons as these legends – we just use animation to show them, and contemporary, relatable conflicts to make them accessible to a wider audience.</p><h3><strong>UPDATE: NEW GOAL FOR A 12-MINUTE PILOT AND EXTENDED DEADLINE</strong></h3><p><strong>20.06.2017 – We have decided to split our pilot episode in half and focus our efforts on a fully animated, complete, 12-minute episode. This would require half the amount we're crowdfunding – around $70 000, and we are very close to reaching it. With the $30 000 already raised, and with the co-production of the Bulgarian National Television, we’re just $15 000 short. So please, help us get to $45 000!</strong></p><p><strong>Cutting costs, however, does not mean we will cut on quality. We still aim to produce a complete, fully animated pilot episode with a developed plot and soundtrack, the only difference being the length of it. Thanks to your help we are closer than ever to the pilot episode of the Golden Apple!</strong></p><p><strong>Also, to give the campaign some more time, we're extending our deadline with 15 days. We can only extend the campaign once, so this is it: We have until 6 July to make this happen!</strong></p><p><strong>Of course, our dream and big goal remains to create a full, 24-minute episode, so we will continue looking for funding for the second half of the pilot. However, we want to finally be able to show you a complete, fully animated episode of the series, even if it has to be shorter. With your incredible help and support, we have a real chance to make a complete, 12-minute episode.</strong></p><h3>Why are we doing this?</h3><p>We are an international team of professionals in the fields of animation, storytelling, design and folklore and we have been working on this project for more than five years. <strong>We want to show the most compelling elements of Balkan culture in a modern, engaging way and help preserve these exotic and unknown legends before they die out.</strong></p><p>Balkan folklore is passed down through songs and spoken stories – the tales are rarely written down or illustrated, apart from some academic texts. These legends promote lessons and morals that are widely applicable to the modern world. Sadly, these stories are slowly perishing, along with the old people who carry them in their traditional songs and tales.</p><p>The first 3 years of the project were mostly devoted to research – designing the visual style of the series, traveling around small villages and immersing ourselves in the culture of the Balkans, talking to old people and identifying the core elements of the story.</p><p><strong>We found out that Balkan legends are based on several defining cultural aspects that became the foundation of The Golden Apple series:</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Nothing is black or white</strong><br/>The fantastical creatures in Balkan folklore represent nature, and as such can be both helpful or harmful, depending on how people threat them.</li>
<li>
<strong>Respect for nature</strong><br/>Our folklore is based on the deep understanding of the elements and the interconnection between humans and their environment. </li>
<li>
<strong>A sense of belonging</strong><br/>Balkan folklore is focused on bringing people together, and creating a collective in which people rely on each other to overcome the obstacles that come their way.<br/>This idea became central to the plot of The Golden Apple series – each of our main characters is motivated not only by their personal desires, but by the wish to help their community. The characters are forced to work through their differences and discover that the only way to achieve their goal is by sticking together.</li>
</ul><p>Our team was amazed at the treasures these stories hide, and at how easily their morals can be applied to the modern world. We realised it would be a terrible loss to let these tales die out along with the old people who kept them. And besides preserving and presenting this centuries old culture in a contemporary way, <strong>we aim to tell a modern, yet relatable story, set in an exotic and mystical setting, which has not been shown before</strong></p><h2>Why crowdfunding?</h2><p>The Bulgarian National Television has become a co-producer of the project, providing 20% of the funding for the pilot episode. They are showing interest in airing the entire series, but only after they see a finished pilot.</p><p><strong>This is where we hit a wall. </strong>There has been great interest in The Golden Apple, but since there has never been a similar project created in Bulgaria, everyone wants to see that we can pull off a good pilot before they invest in the entire production.</p><p>We tried finding the rest of the 80% funding for the pilot through various ways, but were faced with a tough decision. We had to either surrender creative control on the project, which would defeat its purpose; continue working in our spare time and take ages to complete an episode… or try something else.</p><p><strong>Then we realized that YOU, the fans and supporters of the project, have been the only constant that has allowed us to continue working. Both Studio Zmei and The Golden Apple exist ONLY and ENTIRELY thanks to the amazing support of the people who believe in the project! </strong></p><p><strong>This is why, once again, we turn to you, our fans and supporters. By backing us in this campaign, you will become a co-producer on the series, and will directly help preserve and present the best elements of Balkan culture and folklore trough modern animation!</strong></p><p>Besides the perks and awards, you will also get access to <strong>exclusive, monthly video log updates</strong>. These will be our way of showing you, our co-producers, how we are using your investment and what progress we are making.</p><p>We found out that the only way for us to continue forward, and make The Golden Apple the way we believe it is supposed to be, is with your support. Only with your help, we can take this step forward and create a complete pilot episode and use it to secure funding for the entire series.

<h3><strong>The story of The Golden Apple project</strong></h3>
<p>The project was launched about 5 years ago. In the first 3 years, we worked entirely in our spare time. In 2015, after a successful crowdfunding campaign, we founded Studio Zmei and for the first time ever we had the opportunity to work full-time on the project. The direct result was the short film <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjFHl8bd2iM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Legend of the First Kuker Warrior</a>, which serves as a prequel to the main story in the series. We have also done tons of more research and visual development, background and character design work. <strong>The first (pilot) episode is completely scripted and we have even started work on parts of the storyboard.</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494342190/keoebazza9rjbhh1ah2j.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>This has allowed us to start negotiating with potential investors and distributors about the entire series. Our idea was to use the momentum and viewer interest from the first crowdfunding campaign as proof of the viewer interest in the project, and to secure funding for the entire first season. <strong>This partly worked – we now have a distribution deal with a French company and interest from the USA, plus the co-production commitment from the Bulgarian National Television... but we still need to secure the remaining 80% of the required funding for the pilot – hence the crowdfunding campaign!</strong> And only after a complete pilot, the interested investors and distributors will help us fund the entire series. <a href=""https://goldenappleseries.com/faq"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">You can find out more details on the Frequently Asked Questions page on our website.</a></p>
<h3><strong>The world of The Golden Apple animated series</strong></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493908743/dmramus0b0kepxnmfqyt.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>This fantasy world is inhabited by humans and spirits. Most spirits are related to a specific force of nature or natural element; for example, the zmei spirits control the storms and fogs, and the samodiva spirits control the rivers. </p>
<p>Humans and spirits have lived in peace and cooperation for hundreds of years in the city of Khan and the surrounding rose valley, which has led to unprecedented development and growth – making Khan the most developed city in the known world.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493908558/mwraya46no1mibcnhlnq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>However, this is not the case everywhere. Far away from Khan, in the Kuker Mountains, people and spirits have been in open conflict for generations. The cities there are built like fortresses, and have huge, magical bells at their gates, to protect them from the evils, lurking in the shadows of the mountains.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493906157/oqmwflteyijlz6v0m5wn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Тhe only way people can even survive in the Kuker Mountains is because of the Kuker warriors – specially trained fighters who use their magic bells and intricate costumes to fight off the evil spirits and protect the humans. People who want to be Kuker warriors have to attend special Kuker schools and spend years learning how to wield the magical bells.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493901522/ki7lv5hujgvkheosxybd.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>On the other hand, in the vast, wild Kuber Mountain, people and spirits tend to stay away from each other and don’t really have an established dynamic. The people of Kuber Mountain are known as Balkandjees.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493906540/pbeoi8gxnqvs6st5toq1.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The Balkandjees are shepherds – they ride on huge rams (and like to organise races with them), and have huge herds of colourful sheep. No one knows why, but only in Kuber Mountain each sheep has a unique pattern and color. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493901905/mgqmg3ltvyvj8adb7ees.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Our main characters begin their adventure in the city of Khan, quickly pass through the lands of the Kuker and then end up in the mystical Kuber Mountain. </p>
<h3><strong>Music in The Golden Apple project</strong></h3>
<p>The music for the series will be composed by the amazing George Strezov. We have already worked with George on the trailer for the series and our short prequel. He composed an amazing soundtrack, which combines a classic movie orchestra, a Bulgarian folk choir, traditional folk instruments and a Japanese tayko drum. <strong>Check out the making of the ""Legend of the First Kuker Warrior"" soundtrack here:</strong></p>

<p>The style of the series is inspired by the iconic style of the American illustrator Eyvind Earle. We decided to combine this familiar style with traditional Balkan graphic elements, architecture and costumes. The more we dive deeper into this wild world, the more these elements will become apparent. With this approach, we aim to walk a thin line between the familiar and exotic.</p>

<p>Once every hundred years a comet crosses the sky, and wherever it falls, a magical tree appears. The tree bears a single golden apple, which has the power to fulfill wishes. Once the comet appears, creatures and spirits from all over the world set forth to look for the mystical artifact, hoping it will solve all their troubles and problems.  </p>

<h3><strong>The beginning of the story: The Pilot episode</strong></h3>
<p>The Pilot episode of the series will tell the beginning of the story of Vihra, Tina, Bran and Vlad, and will show us the starting point of their journey. It will lay out the foundations for all the conflicts in the show, introduce us to some of the main locations of the series, as well as to the main antagonists. Needless to say, neither the conflict in Khan, nor the destruction of the Kuker Guide were mere accidents. Our main characters will have to uncover a much bigger story if they are to succeed and save their homes.</p>
</div></div>","What is The Golden Apple animated series?The Golden Apple is a fantasy animated series based on Balkan legends and folklore. Every season consists of twelve 24-minute episodes. The series is developed simultaneously in both English and Bulgarian, with the option for more languages.We are telling a modern original story, set in the mystical world of Balkan legends. Our story bears the same heart, morals and lessons as these legends – we just use animation to show them, and contemporary, relatable conflicts to make them accessible to a wider audience.UPDATE: NEW GOAL FOR A 12-MINUTE PILOT AND EXTENDED DEADLINE20.06.2017 – We have decided to split our pilot episode in half and focus our efforts on a fully animated, complete, 12-minute episode. This would require half the amount we're crowdfunding – around $70 000, and we are very close to reaching it. With the $30 000 already raised, and with the co-production of the Bulgarian National Television, we’re just $15 000 short. So please, help us get to $45 000!Cutting costs, however, does not mean we will cut on quality. We still aim to produce a complete, fully animated pilot episode with a developed plot and soundtrack, the only difference being the length of it. Thanks to your help we are closer than ever to the pilot episode of the Golden Apple!Also, to give the campaign some more time, we're extending our deadline with 15 days. We can only extend the campaign once, so this is it: We have until 6 July to make this happen!Of course, our dream and big goal remains to create a full, 24-minute episode, so we will continue looking for funding for the second half of the pilot. However, we want to finally be able to show you a complete, fully animated episode of the series, even if it has to be shorter. With your incredible help and support, we have a real chance to make a complete, 12-minute episode.Why are we doing this?We are an international team of professionals in the fields of animation, storytelling, design and folklore and we have been working on this project for more than five years. We want to show the most compelling elements of Balkan culture in a modern, engaging way and help preserve these exotic and unknown legends before they die out.Balkan folklore is passed down through songs and spoken stories – the tales are rarely written down or illustrated, apart from some academic texts. These legends promote lessons and morals that are widely applicable to the modern world. Sadly, these stories are slowly perishing, along with the old people who carry them in their traditional songs and tales.The first 3 years of the project were mostly devoted to research – designing the visual style of the series, traveling around small villages and immersing ourselves in the culture of the Balkans, talking to old people and identifying the core elements of the story.We found out that Balkan legends are based on several defining cultural aspects that became the foundation of The Golden Apple series:

Nothing is black or whiteThe fantastical creatures in Balkan folklore represent nature, and as such can be both helpful or harmful, depending on how people threat them.

Respect for natureOur folklore is based on the deep understanding of the elements and the interconnection between humans and their environment. 

A sense of belongingBalkan folklore is focused on bringing people together, and creating a collective in which people rely on each other to overcome the obstacles that come their way.This idea became central to the plot of The Golden Apple series – each of our main characters is motivated not only by their personal desires, but by the wish to help their community. The characters are forced to work through their differences and discover that the only way to achieve their goal is by sticking together.
Our team was amazed at the treasures these stories hide, and at how easily their morals can be applied to the modern world. We realised it would be a terrible loss to let these tales die out along with the old people who kept them. And besides preserving and presenting this centuries old culture in a contemporary way, we aim to tell a modern, yet relatable story, set in an exotic and mystical setting, which has not been shown beforeWhy crowdfunding?The Bulgarian National Television has become a co-producer of the project, providing 20% of the funding for the pilot episode. They are showing interest in airing the entire series, but only after they see a finished pilot.This is where we hit a wall. There has been great interest in The Golden Apple, but since there has never been a similar project created in Bulgaria, everyone wants to see that we can pull off a good pilot before they invest in the entire production.We tried finding the rest of the 80% funding for the pilot through various ways, but were faced with a tough decision. We had to either surrender creative control on the project, which would defeat its purpose; continue working in our spare time and take ages to complete an episode… or try something else.Then we realized that YOU, the fans and supporters of the project, have been the only constant that has allowed us to continue working. Both Studio Zmei and The Golden Apple exist ONLY and ENTIRELY thanks to the amazing support of the people who believe in the project! This is why, once again, we turn to you, our fans and supporters. By backing us in this campaign, you will become a co-producer on the series, and will directly help preserve and present the best elements of Balkan culture and folklore trough modern animation!Besides the perks and awards, you will also get access to exclusive, monthly video log updates. These will be our way of showing you, our co-producers, how we are using your investment and what progress we are making.We found out that the only way for us to continue forward, and make The Golden Apple the way we believe it is supposed to be, is with your support. Only with your help, we can take this step forward and create a complete pilot episode and use it to secure funding for the entire series. If we reach our target goal, we will be able to produce a fully animated pilot episode.How can I help?If you have been with us thus far, THANK YOU! It would mean the world for us if you back this project and help make the Pilot episode a reality.Even if you can't support us financially, it would be just as beneficial if you spread the word: Share the campaign on social media or on your blog, or just tell people about the project. We are honoured that because of your amazing support so far, we've been able to continue our work. We will not give up and with your help, we can make this series a reality. This is your project.

We would like to say a special THANK YOU here to our partners from MOVE.BG, who have been actively supporting us on our journey in creating The Golden Apple. MOVE.BG is a platform for value creators working for good society in Bulgaria. They are looking for innovative solutions for social transformation, working for sustainable development and affirming a culture of constructive dialog, participating leadership and shared values.
 
The story of The Golden Apple project
The project was launched about 5 years ago. In the first 3 years, we worked entirely in our spare time. In 2015, after a successful crowdfunding campaign, we founded Studio Zmei and for the first time ever we had the opportunity to work full-time on the project. The direct result was the short film Legend of the First Kuker Warrior, which serves as a prequel to the main story in the series. We have also done tons of more research and visual development, background and character design work. The first (pilot) episode is completely scripted and we have even started work on parts of the storyboard.

This has allowed us to start negotiating with potential investors and distributors about the entire series. Our idea was to use the momentum and viewer interest from the first crowdfunding campaign as proof of the viewer interest in the project, and to secure funding for the entire first season. This partly worked – we now have a distribution deal with a French company and interest from the USA, plus the co-production commitment from the Bulgarian National Television... but we still need to secure the remaining 80% of the required funding for the pilot – hence the crowdfunding campaign! And only after a complete pilot, the interested investors and distributors will help us fund the entire series. You can find out more details on the Frequently Asked Questions page on our website.
The world of The Golden Apple animated series

This fantasy world is inhabited by humans and spirits. Most spirits are related to a specific force of nature or natural element; for example, the zmei spirits control the storms and fogs, and the samodiva spirits control the rivers. 
Humans and spirits have lived in peace and cooperation for hundreds of years in the city of Khan and the surrounding rose valley, which has led to unprecedented development and growth – making Khan the most developed city in the known world.

However, this is not the case everywhere. Far away from Khan, in the Kuker Mountains, people and spirits have been in open conflict for generations. The cities there are built like fortresses, and have huge, magical bells at their gates, to protect them from the evils, lurking in the shadows of the mountains.

Тhe only way people can even survive in the Kuker Mountains is because of the Kuker warriors – specially trained fighters who use their magic bells and intricate costumes to fight off the evil spirits and protect the humans. People who want to be Kuker warriors have to attend special Kuker schools and spend years learning how to wield the magical bells.


On the other hand, in the vast, wild Kuber Mountain, people and spirits tend to stay away from each other and don’t really have an established dynamic. The people of Kuber Mountain are known as Balkandjees.
The Balkandjees are shepherds – they ride on huge rams (and like to organise races with them), and have huge herds of colourful sheep. No one knows why, but only in Kuber Mountain each sheep has a unique pattern and color. 

 

Our main characters begin their adventure in the city of Khan, quickly pass through the lands of the Kuker and then end up in the mystical Kuber Mountain. 
Music in The Golden Apple project
The music for the series will be composed by the amazing George Strezov. We have already worked with George on the trailer for the series and our short prequel. He composed an amazing soundtrack, which combines a classic movie orchestra, a Bulgarian folk choir, traditional folk instruments and a Japanese tayko drum. Check out the making of the ""Legend of the First Kuker Warrior"" soundtrack here:

Visual style of the project


 
 

The style of the series is inspired by the iconic style of the American illustrator Eyvind Earle. We decided to combine this familiar style with traditional Balkan graphic elements, architecture and costumes. The more we dive deeper into this wild world, the more these elements will become apparent. With this approach, we aim to walk a thin line between the familiar and exotic.
The main story in The Golden Apple animated series

Once every hundred years a comet crosses the sky, and wherever it falls, a magical tree appears. The tree bears a single golden apple, which has the power to fulfill wishes. Once the comet appears, creatures and spirits from all over the world set forth to look for the mystical artifact, hoping it will solve all their troubles and problems.  
Meanwhile, a conflict between humans and spirits in the city of Khan quickly escalates, and the peace is lost.

Vihra, the daughter of the two leaders – Vulkan Zmei, leader of the spirits, and Iskra – mayor of Khan, sees no other way to help her parents, and decides to go and find the golden apple. She plans to wish for peace, and thus save her home town and her family.

She is joined by her best friend – the Samodiva spirit Tina.
Tina-Pakostina is Vihra’s best friend – a mischievous, very talkative samodiva spirit who likes playing jokes. As a samodiva nymph, she can influence nature around herself through her song and dance. Tina belongs to a conservative Samodiva tribe from the forest near the town of Khan, but she is curious about the world outside her forest so every chance she gets, she sneaks out in search of adventures with Vihra.
Meanwhile, our other two main characters – the brothers Bran and Vlad – accidentally become responsible for the destruction of the Kuker guide. The Kuker guide is an ancient book, which is said to contain all the secrets of the Kuker magic, which the Kuker warriors use to fight evil spirits. Bran and Vlad decide that there is no other way to save their people, but to find the golden apple and wish for a new Kuker guide.But to succeed, the events lead the two brothers to only one option. The two kuker brothers, who have been taught from an early age that all spirits are evil, have to join Vihra – an obvious half-spirit, and Tina – a samodiva water spirit, on a huge adventure. At first, there is conflict in the group – Bran and Vlad don't want to trust the half-spirit girl and the samodiva water spirit, and there is only one golden apple. During the course of the series however, this conflict turns into a legendary friendship.

The beginning of the story: The Pilot episode
The Pilot episode of the series will tell the beginning of the story of Vihra, Tina, Bran and Vlad, and will show us the starting point of their journey. It will lay out the foundations for all the conflicts in the show, introduce us to some of the main locations of the series, as well as to the main antagonists. Needless to say, neither the conflict in Khan, nor the destruction of the Kuker Guide were mere accidents. Our main characters will have to uncover a much bigger story if they are to succeed and save their homes.",33.0,2,"1 Campaign

<h3>A Monster Series... Without the Monsters...</h3>
<p>As fans of the classic monster movie genre, we wanted to make a series about what it would be like hunting those monsters today, with all the misinformation circulating the internet. But we've all seen a toughened hero fighting a stuntman in a rubber costume (or more recently, a stuntman in a green zentai suit). What we wanted to deliver was the hero fighting themself, and ask the question, ""when does the hero become the real monster?"".</p>
<p>So we're doing this by having Mike vlog about his experiences instead. You get to see the hero's personal perspective, while he processes his new lifestyle choice. You can see a teaser of what that will look like here:</p>

<h3>Silver Bullets are Expensive!</h3>
<p>We have a lot of fantastic ideas for the first season, and we just need some helping bringing those ideas to life. </p>
<p>That's why we're raising a some money to pay for graphics, sound composition, makeup and  props.</p>
<p>Makeup: Mike is going to get pretty beat up on his hunts. So the fx costs for his bruises, gashes and wounds are going to add up. </p>
<p>Props: We're keen on creating a set that grows with the character. Each hunt will bring new trophies or gadgets, which will be added to the backdrop throughout the season. Also, who doesn't want a crossbow?</p>
<p>Sound: What's a horror movie without a great soundtrack? We want to hire artists to make original music for the show, giving it that extra kick of energy that Mike needs to fight an ancient evil.</p>
<p>Graphics: A few artists have donated their time to the project already, but time is valuable. We wish to compensate everyone who has helped out for their time. As well as pay for future art that we need created for the show. It's important to us to pay artists for their work whenever possible, and we are grateful to those who choose to donate their time to our project. </p>
<p>If you contribute we have various perks to offer, but most importantly, anyone who contributes $10 or more gains access to bonus content we will make throughout the series. Such As:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mike reviewing old monster movies</li>
<li>More detailed descriptions of Mike's hunts, play by plays of his fights, etc. (Also if we reach our stretch goal we will create a MHM Comic to go with each episode) </li>
<li>Live Q/A's with Mike and Zac</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Show &amp; Why We're Making It</h3>
<p>Library Freaks is web series that follows Bea Nixon &amp; Thaddeus Peterson, two high school students trying to cope with mental illness on top of everything else life throws at them. It's smart, quirky, sensitive, and even a bit romantic. </p>
<p>This show is near and dear to our hearts as we have both been teenagers, and have both had personal experience with mental illness. </p>
<h3>The Creative Team</h3>
<p>We are Tyler Meacham and Grace Day, two crazy gals with the wild notion of puttin' on a show!</p>
<p>Tyler is a graduate of Elon University, where she studied Cinema and Television Arts and was an all-around boss, from singing with an a cappella group AND an indie-folk duo to producing original content on YouTube (which she's been doing since 2007, nbd). After graduation, she interned with Walt Disney Imagineering. She can pretty much do it all: video production, editing, photography, graphic design, content development, singing, acting, dancing, unicorn-wrangling, you name it.</p>
<p>Grace is Tyler's number one fan, and the author of the above paragraph, basking in her glory since the early days of their friendship in 9th grade Honors English. Grace has a degree in acting from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and a B.S. in psychology from Virginia Commonwealth University, because she just couldn't get enough of school! She has performed professionally on various stages across Virginia and New York City, and her face was recently on advertisements in subway cars, so she's just checking off one bucket list item at a time. </p>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>We need emotional and financial support to make this happen! Specifically, we are raising funds for camera and equipment rentals, location fees, props, costumes, set dressing, and hopefully, the ability to pay our cast and crew with more than just free food.</p>
<p>We want Library Freaks to look beautiful, and generally speaking, the more we can invest in our equipment and production design, the better looking the final product will be. So, here’s a more detailed breakdown of how we plan to use our campaign funds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Equipment<ul>
<li>We could easily spend between $1000 and $2000 on renting a <strong>camera</strong>, <strong>lenses</strong>, <strong>stabilizer</strong>, and other <strong>support rigs</strong> alone.</li>
<li>Because most of our shooting locations are interiors, we’ll need to rent a full <strong>lighting package </strong>to make sure our scenes can be seen! This is another large &amp; important expense.</li>
<li>We can’t tell a story if you can’t hear the actors, so we also would like to invest in high quality <strong>audio gear </strong>to use on set.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Production Design<ul><li>Although we will primarily gather <strong>props, costumes</strong>, and <strong>set pieces</strong> by borrowing (and not spending money), there are some special pieces we simply can’t get without buying or making them. <ul><li>PS: One of these very special pieces also happens to be a perk for our backers!</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Locations<ul><li>A portion of our budget will go towards <strong>location fees</strong> and acquiring any necessary <strong>permits</strong> for filming on location.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Post-Production Needs<ul><li>Although most of our budget will support the production of our show, it’s not complete until it’s been edited. Some of our post production needs include d<strong>igital storage (SD cards &amp; external drives)</strong>,<strong> music acquisition</strong>, and <strong>rights clearance</strong> for any assets (images, sounds, etc.) that might appear in our production.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Everything else!<ul><li>We <i>need</i> to be able to support our cast and crew on shoot days with ample <strong>craft services</strong> (that’s the free food part), but we really want to be able to provide our team with a <strong>stipend</strong> for their hard work. It’s a big goal, but your contribution will help us reach it.</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Why This Matters</strong></h3>
<p>Mental health awareness is an important cause to us, and the stats on how mental illness impacts children, teens, and young adults are staggering. Take a look at this infographic from the National Alliance on Mental Illness:</p>
<h3><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502469795/g75t0so2hrgvobhego46.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></h3>
<p>Mental illness has made an impact on our personal lives, as well. We know how difficult it can be to deal with and how hard it can be to understand. That's why we want Library Freaks educate our audience on self-care, de-stigmatize the conversation surrounding mental health in young adults, and tell a story about realistic characters who are more than their illnesses.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are unable to contribute financially, we totally understand. (Trust us--we're only recently out of college, so we get that budgets are tight!)

<h3>So What Is ""For Nothing"" All About</h3>
<p>For Nothing is the first novel in An Upstate New York Mafia Tale, an Amazon bestselling series. Having sold more than 250,000 copies to date, this project is a mafia-genre story that primarily takes place in Buffalo, NY and spans Western New York all the way to Upstate New York. By supporting this project you will allow us to film the story in Buffalo, NY and showcase the city, putting a spotlight on a place that is often overlooked or forgotten. You will also allow us to take the pilot to investors to get the tremendous amount of funding for a full season of mafia-style intrigue and hard-boiled detective intensity we believe you want to see.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1575644647/ggymxvpt2ekacomzjvre.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Who Are We? </h3>
<p>Aeri Productions has teamed up with author Nicholas Denmon in an attempt to turn the cult series, An Upstate New York Mafia Tale (of which For Nothing is book one) into a television series. The series has sold more than 250,000 copies to date and has been an Amazon bestseller several times over.</p>
<p>Aeri Productions is helmed by visionary Steven Quach who has filmed for large brands such as H&amp;M, Culvers, World of Beer, Marriott among others. He has also directed numerous short films such as  Beyond the Dark, Ashes in Trinity, and the For Nothing Concept Short.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1575644039/v0rdgfouzodidtlohmyo.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Nicholas Denmon is an international bestselling author. Dubbed the ""Savior of Mob Fiction,"" by Men's Mag Daily, his series An Upstate New York Mafia Tale has topped the Organized Crime genre more than nine times. He is also from the great city of Buffalo, NY and wants to highlight his home as well as stay true to the setting of his novels. Buffalo, he feels, is often a forgotten city but is a great city rich with history and culture that would be perfect for the screen. He wants to share this with the world - all while telling a mafia story that will keep you on the edge of your seat.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1575644710/sncfrakffvjoyyqacvff.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>An origin story, the pilot takes place three years before the initial story of For Nothing. For Nothing brings us on a journey as undercover cop Alex Vaughn goes deeper than ever into the organized crime family of Buffalo, NY. Motivated by justice and revenge, he seeks out the assassin that laid his friend low. Professional killer Rafael Rontego traverses the deadly politics of Buffalo’s mafia underbelly. In a city whose winter can be just as deadly as those wielding power, Rontego tries to stay ahead of the game.</p>

<p> Their two worlds collide in this epic thriller that takes the reader on a search for self, justice, and truth. The pilot explores all the chess pieces: mafia wars, federal indictments, and the quest for justice which set up the events that unfold at the beginning of the written series.</p>

<h3>The Cast</h3>
<p><strong>Tom Sizemore </strong>as Salvatore Pieri, Boss of Bosses</p>

<p>Tom Sizemore</p>
<p>Sizemore is probably most widely recalled for his role as ""Sergeant Horvath"" in Saving Private Ryan. The role and film received wide acclaim and introduced Sizemore's talents to a much broader audience in a more human and well-rounded role than he had previously been given. </p>
<p>Sizemore then portrayed a psychotic paramedic in Bringing Out the Dead directed by Martin Scorsese followed by performances in Play It to the Bone, Red Planet, and Pearl Harbor. Sizemore then received another leading role in the high-profile military drama Black Hawk Down directed by legendary director, Ridley Scott.<br/><br/>Specializing in the sort of ultimate tough-guy/manly man roles that hearken back to a different era in film, Sizemore continues to be a favorite of Hollywood's greatest directors. A commanding voice and presence on film, Sizemore will now lead a talented cast on the pilot episode of gangster drama For Nothing.</p>

He hosted ""The Daniel Baldwin Show"" on radio station WTLA in Syracuse from 2017 to 2019.[2][3] He has also been an emcee for the television series truTV Presents: World's Dumbest.</p>

For Nothing is the first novel in An Upstate New York Mafia Tale, an Amazon bestselling series. Having sold more than 250,000 copies to date, this project is a mafia-genre story that primarily takes place in Buffalo, NY and spans Western New York all the way to Upstate New York. By supporting this project you will allow us to film the story in Buffalo, NY and showcase the city, putting a spotlight on a place that is often overlooked or forgotten. You will also allow us to take the pilot to investors to get the tremendous amount of funding for a full season of mafia-style intrigue and hard-boiled detective intensity we believe you want to see.

Who Are We? 
Aeri Productions has teamed up with author Nicholas Denmon in an attempt to turn the cult series, An Upstate New York Mafia Tale (of which For Nothing is book one) into a television series. The series has sold more than 250,000 copies to date and has been an Amazon bestseller several times over.
Aeri Productions is helmed by visionary Steven Quach who has filmed for large brands such as H&M, Culvers, World of Beer, Marriott among others. He has also directed numerous short films such as  Beyond the Dark, Ashes in Trinity, and the For Nothing Concept Short.

Nicholas Denmon is an international bestselling author. Dubbed the ""Savior of Mob Fiction,"" by Men's Mag Daily, his series An Upstate New York Mafia Tale has topped the Organized Crime genre more than nine times. He is also from the great city of Buffalo, NY and wants to highlight his home as well as stay true to the setting of his novels. Buffalo, he feels, is often a forgotten city but is a great city rich with history and culture that would be perfect for the screen. He wants to share this with the world - all while telling a mafia story that will keep you on the edge of your seat.

The Story
An origin story, the pilot takes place three years before the initial story of For Nothing. For Nothing brings us on a journey as undercover cop Alex Vaughn goes deeper than ever into the organized crime family of Buffalo, NY. Motivated by justice and revenge, he seeks out the assassin that laid his friend low. Professional killer Rafael Rontego traverses the deadly politics of Buffalo’s mafia underbelly. In a city whose winter can be just as deadly as those wielding power, Rontego tries to stay ahead of the game.

 Their two worlds collide in this epic thriller that takes the reader on a search for self, justice, and truth. The pilot explores all the chess pieces: mafia wars, federal indictments, and the quest for justice which set up the events that unfold at the beginning of the written series.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We here at Cellar 13 Films have a combined 60 years in the media and film industry. We are passionate about making compelling movies and TV shows that will keep you talking about them over and over again. Our last film has been accepted and played in 5 different film festivals all over the world. We are also currently a semi finalist for a Los Angeles Film Festival. We have an award winning director on the show, and editor that has worked with Francis Ford Coppola, and an Elly Award winning DP. </p>
<p> </p>
</li>
<li>This campaign is important to us, because we are tired of ""reality"" shows out there, that aren't true reality. They are nothing but scripted shows full of fake drama, just to boost ratings. We want to do a true reality show, that not only will give you tantalizing drama, but will also dive into the real live of these bounty hunters. We will show and tell you who Tony The Tiger was as a boxer, and who he is as a bounty hunter, philanthropist, and loving family man. We will show you the life and times from all 4 bounty hunters, and explore what they do on their down time. Of course there will be plenty of action from the chases that are bound to ensue. We will explain the bail bonds process from the first phone call from jail, to the first office visit, to the first pound on the door to catch a runner. We will also show you what Tony does out in the community as he helps train up and coming boxers, and how he teaches at risk youth within a classroom setting. </li>
<li>As a contributor, you will help bring TRUE REALITY to reality TV. You will also be helping to keep at risk youth off of the streets, because part of the proceeds from this show will go towards Tony's charities for youth.

</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>We will be using the funds to make sure that we have everything put into place for the show. It also pays for the crew who follows Tony and his boys around, and also all of the post production. </li>
<li>Some of the perks include, signed memorabilia from Tony, and also from the show. Some people may get the chance to be on set to see how the whole show process goes. Also, dinner with Tony, the crew of the show, and the film crew. A few lucky people will also get a private screening of the pilot once it is finished.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Our show is valuable, because we show the true nature and compassion of these guys, as well as the flip side when they need to get their job done. There will be no ""acting"" in the show, this will be 100% true to life.</li>
<li>Every project that we have funded off of Indiegogo has gone on to see success within the film festival world.</li>
<li>There are no hidden agendas here, we are just wanting to create great content for TV and VOD. We want people to engage in the show, and to understand that Bounty Hunters aren't all juiced up freaks with narcissism tendencies. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<p>We have been in the movie business for a while now, and we know and understand all of the pitfalls and obstacles that can come our way. We have a contingency plan for ANYTHING that may try and hinder production. We have a very professional crew that knows how to handle adversity, and we never fall behind, nor do we ever quit. Even when our sound guy once lost a complete day of sound, we took care of it and still made our tight deadline. </p>
<p>So, in short, there isn't anything that we can't handle, because we have already lived it and know how to handle it.</p>

</div><p> </p></div>","Short Summary
 


We here at Cellar 13 Films have a combined 60 years in the media and film industry. We are passionate about making compelling movies and TV shows that will keep you talking about them over and over again. Our last film has been accepted and played in 5 different film festivals all over the world. We are also currently a semi finalist for a Los Angeles Film Festival. We have an award winning director on the show, and editor that has worked with Francis Ford Coppola, and an Elly Award winning DP. 
 

This campaign is important to us, because we are tired of ""reality"" shows out there, that aren't true reality. They are nothing but scripted shows full of fake drama, just to boost ratings. We want to do a true reality show, that not only will give you tantalizing drama, but will also dive into the real live of these bounty hunters. We will show and tell you who Tony The Tiger was as a boxer, and who he is as a bounty hunter, philanthropist, and loving family man. We will show you the life and times from all 4 bounty hunters, and explore what they do on their down time. Of course there will be plenty of action from the chases that are bound to ensue. We will explain the bail bonds process from the first phone call from jail, to the first office visit, to the first pound on the door to catch a runner. We will also show you what Tony does out in the community as he helps train up and coming boxers, and how he teaches at risk youth within a classroom setting. 
As a contributor, you will help bring TRUE REALITY to reality TV. You will also be helping to keep at risk youth off of the streets, because part of the proceeds from this show will go towards Tony's charities for youth. You will help bring a show to the airways that people can actually connect to.


What We Need & What You Get
 

We will be using the funds to make sure that we have everything put into place for the show. It also pays for the crew who follows Tony and his boys around, and also all of the post production. 
Some of the perks include, signed memorabilia from Tony, and also from the show. Some people may get the chance to be on set to see how the whole show process goes. Also, dinner with Tony, the crew of the show, and the film crew. A few lucky people will also get a private screening of the pilot once it is finished.


The Impact

Our show is valuable, because we show the true nature and compassion of these guys, as well as the flip side when they need to get their job done. There will be no ""acting"" in the show, this will be 100% true to life.
Every project that we have funded off of Indiegogo has gone on to see success within the film festival world.
There are no hidden agendas here, we are just wanting to create great content for TV and VOD. We want people to engage in the show, and to understand that Bounty Hunters aren't all juiced up freaks with narcissism tendencies. 


Risks & Challenges
 

We have been in the movie business for a while now, and we know and understand all of the pitfalls and obstacles that can come our way. We have a contingency plan for ANYTHING that may try and hinder production. We have a very professional crew that knows how to handle adversity, and we never fall behind, nor do we ever quit. Even when our sound guy once lost a complete day of sound, we took care of it and still made our tight deadline. 
So, in short, there isn't anything that we can't handle, because we have already lived it and know how to handle it.

<p>We created this Indiegogo campaign to raise the money needed to film the entire first Season of <i>Killer Crew</i>.  We are a passionate and committed group of filmmakers looking to bring the characters in this story come to life.</p>
<p>Help us and join us throughout our journey!</p> <p><strong>STORY</strong></p>
<p>For most peers, college means papers, finals, and the occasional all-nighters, but for these four young adults it means shovels, body bags, and the not so occasional dead professor. In an attempt to change their final grade gone wrong; three sophomores Will, Chuck, and Mothy accidentally kill their cruel Biology professor. Enlisting the help of their nosey room advisor Liv, this jump starts a comical adventure as they go step by step in attempting to conceal their heinous crime and get off scot-free. Some people say college is tough, for these guys it’s literally murder.</p> <p><strong>SERIES LOGLINE</strong></p>
<p>Four college students get their world turned upside down when a bad grade leads to the death of the their professor.</p> <p><strong>INSPIRATION</strong></p>
<p>Dark comedy has always had a special place in the roots of the <i>Killer Crew</i> team, with majority of our projects having a macabre nuance to them. It was always fun to take conventionally dark things like death or crime and subvert the people’s expectations with a lighter tone. We pulled inspirations from various classic media that we grew up on to help shape what the show is now. These range from classics such as <i>Beetle Juice</i> and <i>Heathers </i>to more recent additions like <i>Shawn of the Dead</i> and <i>Horrible Bosses</i>. It was Mark Twain who said “Humour is tragedy plus time”. So in a time where the state of our world is arguably at it’s bleakest; it’s not hard to find humour in things, you just need to no where to look.</p> <p><strong>THE TEAM</strong></p>
<p>Part Time Productions is a partnership of skilled postgraduate filmmakers originating from New Jersey. We are an independent production company focused on creating high quality digital content. We are dedicated to telling rich, unique and diverse stories.</p> <p><strong>Romario Achille -  Co-Creator/Writer:</strong> Romario Achille is an independent writer/director from Irvington, New Jersey. Romario has been interested in all forms of media since he was in high school and spent time writing numerous screenplays, one of which was accepted by the annual Teen Arts Festival. With a BFA in Television Production at Montclair State University, he has written, produced, and directed multiple short films such as <i>Girl on Fire, 101 Ways to Kill Yourself,</i> and <i>What’s The Worst That Could Happen</i>. As of now he is currently an Assistant Editor at NBC Universal and is head writer of <i>Killer Crew</i>, a passion project 5 years in making.</p> <p><strong>Matthew Borrello - Co-Creator/Director: </strong>Matt is a film buff, turned film student, turned filmmaker.  Like all the greats, he started watching movies as a little kid and developing a love for the cinema.  However, it wasn’t until college when he decided to focus his career on making the very art that he loved.  Matt graduated Seton Hall University with a degree in Visual Media. He is an award winning film director, and he has worked on many popular television shows such <i>Law and Order: SVU</i> and Marvel’s <i>The Punisher</i>.  As a filmmaker, horror is his favorite genre and greatest inspiration. In fact, every story that he tells, involves death in one way or another. Obviously Killer Crew is no exception.  As the co-creator and director on the series, he's excited to bring this darkly humorous story to life.</p> <p><strong>Jose Cortez - Producer: </strong>Jose is a Producer/Editor/Videographer based in Clifton, New Jersey.  He graduated from Montclair State University where he received a BA in Television Production. Throughout college Jose maintained a busy schedule serving first as the Assistant Programming Director then Station Manager for MSU’s college radio station 90.3 WMSC-FM, interning at <i>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</i> &amp; <i>LXTV’s George to the Rescue</i> and <i>Open House</i>, and working on several student films, including his last film <i>Sticks &amp; Bones</i> where he served as a producer.  He is currently an Assistant Editor at NBCUniversal.  </p> <p><strong>THE CAST:</strong></p>
<p>We are nearing the end of our casting. We feel confident we have found the best and talented ensemble cast. We will soon introduce you to our wonderful group of actors.</p> <p><strong>WHAT WE NEED</strong></p>
<p>The biggest thing we need is financial support to make this happen!!!</p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $10,500 to film 7 episodes for Season 1 of <i>Killer Crew</i>.</p>
<p>Majority of the money we raise will go into our production costs. This includes camera and equipment rentals fees, location fees, food, props, costumes, food, set dressing, travel expenses, hotels, and yes more food.  We would really like the ability to pay our cast and crew with more than just “free” food.</p> <p><strong>WHAT YOU GET</strong></p>
<p>With your help, we would like to do our part in giving back!</p>
<p>Depending on the contribution amount, we will provide all rewards that come with it. Your contribution will play a great impact in the success of our production.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, all the funds will continue to go towards making Killer Crew possible.</p> <p><strong>RISK/CHALLENGES</strong></p>
<p>Our biggest challenge we may face is travel.  We are attempting to shoot 7 episodes in a span of 24 days.  We have been fortunate that we have locked down some great locations to shoot in, but getting our cast and crew there may be a challenge.  Most of our locations are located throughout northern New Jersey.</p>
<p>However, no matter how well we plan things out, there will always be something that will undoubtedly go wrong. It’s the nature of filmmaking! For this reason, we are setting aside a portion of our funds to use for contingency.  This will help us deal with any problems that may or will arise. We are fully confident that no matter what problems we encounter, we will be ready to take it head on!</p> <p><strong>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</strong></p>

<p>Are you a new vegetarian, part time vegetarian, or dedicated vegan who wants to discover new recipes that taste great, are healthy, and no meat?</p>
<p>Help us to create a new type of vegetarian cooking TV show that is a mix of entertaining television shows with discoverable and interactive online content.</p>
<h3>About the VegiPlus.TV Show</h3>
<p>Our vegetarian cooking program is a mix of the most tasty and popular cooking videos that come from chefs, restaurants, and popular online cooking videos with interactive online information that helps you to discover restaurants, groups, events, and other stuff that makes vegetarian life better and more exciting.</p>
<h3>We Need Your Help - and Rewards</h3>
<p>While some of our production team are unpaid volunteers who are passionate about helping others to eat less meat, we do need some money for experienced professionals, for graphics services, and to pay for broadcasting and streaming costs.</p>
<p>Rewards are Good For You - please contribute and help us and choose a reward that helps you.</p>
<h3>Why We Started the Project</h3>
<p>The founders Timothy Bell and Lawrence Harte are part-time vegetarians (full time wannabes) who were constantly looking for better tasting vegetarian food and easier ways to get and prepare it. They did the normal stuff - got cookbooks, searched for videos, and talk to other vegetarians.</p>
<p>We realized that we could make an MTV like vegetarian cooking TV show with great videos which could be linked and combined with additional information to make finding and getting tasty vegetarian food easier.</p>
<p>If you want to relax and watch a 30 minute show on vegetarian BBQ, lean back and watch it on TV. Want to find quick preparation vegetarian breakfast recipes that are high protein and low calorie, enter a few options and recipes with preparation videos are available. Watch on TV, your smartphone, or on the VegiPlus.TV website.</p>
<h3>Amazing New Vegetarian Taste Experiences</h3>
<p>Eating vegetarian food can be an amazing taste experience if you have the right recipes. We find the best recipes, add options and preparation tips, and get or produce the cooking video.</p>
<h3>Why This Program is Important</h3>
<p>Helping people to enjoy being a vegetarian with less fuss and lower cost helps the reduction of meat consumption. Vegetarians typically live 4 years longer, feel better, and vegetarian recipes can provide amazing new taste experiences.</p>
<h3>Where You can Watch VegiPlus.TV</h3>
<p>Initially VegiPlus.TV will be available on Roku and on the VegiPlus.TV website. We will quickly expand to provide VegiPlus.TV on Amazon Video and other Internet TV platforms. In early 2018, we will start to provide VegiPlus TV on Local TV stations throughout the USA.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Besides contributing financially, sharing VegiPlus.TV with as many people as possible. By sharing this campaign on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and other social media platforms you can let your friends and the world learn how to enjoy more tasty food, feel better, and live longer.</p>

<p>I am Thomas Allen Harris and I’ve been using film, photography, and performance to explore family and identity for the past 25 years! My goal with my new TV show project <a href=""http://www.familypicturesusa.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Family Pictures USA</i></a> is to create a healing movement, using family photographs to better understand ourselves and others across differences of race, religion, class, gender, orientation, and ability.</p>

<p>Each episode will illuminate connections among and between family narratives to create an inclusive <strong>new American Family Album</strong>! The series will expose threads of history that enrich and enlarge our understanding of our nation and its diverse people while expanding our ideas of <strong>WHO WE ARE</strong>. It continues my work to bridge inter-generational and cross-cultural differences and bring communities closer together by <strong>transforming strangers into family</strong>.</p> <p>Our pilot series kicks off in Detroit where we filmed over a hundred families this past summer and got an insider look on the Motor City through the lens of family photos! We are redefining the family photo album in the digital age and <strong>creating a new purpose for our old pictures</strong>!</p>

<p><i>Family Pictures USA </i>emerged out of <i>Digital Diaspora Family Reunion (DDFR)</i>, a transmedia engagement project which has built and refined a community photo sharing model that employs photography, film, live storytelling events and social media to illuminate the importance of a ""people's history."" This socially engaged art project has held live events in more than 50 cities across the United States and across the globe. To date, my team and I have interviewed over 3,000 people and gathered in excess of 30,000 images across the globe. <i>DDFR</i> was born in 2009 during the making of my award-winning documentary film <a href=""http://bit.ly/2ARI6HV"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Through A Lens Darkly: Black Photographers and the Emergence of a People</i></a>, which premiered at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival and was broadcasted nationally on <a href=""http://to.pbs.org/2BKrnpR"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Independent Lens</a>.</p> <h3>How YOU Can Help!</h3>
<p>We have an urgent need for $35,000 to get us in the edit room to complete the 1 hour pilot for national broadcast in 2018! We completed our full production over the summer in Detroit, transcribed hundreds of interviews, archived thousands of photographs and have completed editing the first half of the 1 hour pilot. <strong>Now we need your help to complete the second half of the episode.</strong> Your funds will help support:</p>
<p>- Post-Production Team</p>
<p>- Archival &amp; Research</p>
<p>- Editing</p>
<p>- Music</p>
<p>We have received funding from various foundations but our biggest support is from the public, people who believe in what we are doing! In return for your contributions we put together a fun list of perks so that we can give back to YOU!</p>

<p>Our pilot series features the city of Detroit on the 50th anniversary of the rebellion that forever changed the Motor City. Working in partnership with Detroit Public TV along with cultural and educational institutions (including the Detroit Historical Society’s Detroit 67 Project and the Detroit Institute of Arts), we reached hundreds of thousands of Detroiters. We selected over 100 families to come in and share photo albums that spanned generations, and numerous global origins, to reveal the story of a frontier town that became one of the greatest cities in the nation and captured the imagination of the world and still has much to teach us about perseverance, hustle and triumph over challenges. </p>

<p>Detroit stories were shared by a diverse cast of characters coming from all corners of the city - East Side, West Side, from downtown to 8 Mile. Some of our on-location character interviews included, among many others, industrial artist Tim Burke, Marsha Music - daughter of legendary pre-Motown record producer Joe Von-Battle, Paul Wasserman - owner of Henry the Hatter the oldest hat retailer in the US, and local historian, Baba Jamon Jordan.</p>

My goal with my new TV show project Family Pictures USA is to create a healing movement, using family photographs to better understand ourselves and others across differences of race, religion, class, gender, orientation, and ability.

Each episode will illuminate connections among and between family narratives to create an inclusive new American Family Album! The series will expose threads of history that enrich and enlarge our understanding of our nation and its diverse people while expanding our ideas of WHO WE ARE. It continues my work to bridge inter-generational and cross-cultural differences and bring communities closer together by transforming strangers into family. Our pilot series kicks off in Detroit where we filmed over a hundred families this past summer and got an insider look on the Motor City through the lens of family photos! We are redefining the family photo album in the digital age and creating a new purpose for our old pictures!

Family Pictures USA emerged out of Digital Diaspora Family Reunion (DDFR), a transmedia engagement project which has built and refined a community photo sharing model that employs photography, film, live storytelling events and social media to illuminate the importance of a ""people's history."" This socially engaged art project has held live events in more than 50 cities across the United States and across the globe. To date, my team and I have interviewed over 3,000 people and gathered in excess of 30,000 images across the globe. DDFR was born in 2009 during the making of my award-winning documentary film Through A Lens Darkly: Black Photographers and the Emergence of a People, which premiered at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival and was broadcasted nationally on Independent Lens. How YOU Can Help!
We have an urgent need for $35,000 to get us in the edit room to complete the 1 hour pilot for national broadcast in 2018! We completed our full production over the summer in Detroit, transcribed hundreds of interviews, archived thousands of photographs and have completed editing the first half of the 1 hour pilot. Now we need your help to complete the second half of the episode. Your funds will help support:
- Post-Production Team
- Archival & Research
- Editing
- Music
We have received funding from various foundations but our biggest support is from the public, people who believe in what we are doing! In return for your contributions we put together a fun list of perks so that we can give back to YOU!
If you are a donor and are interested in making a tax-deductible contribution, please contact us directly: info(at)familypicturesusa(dot)com.  ""Detroit is the Future... and it's OK!""
Our pilot series features the city of Detroit on the 50th anniversary of the rebellion that forever changed the Motor City. Working in partnership with Detroit Public TV along with cultural and educational institutions (including the Detroit Historical Society’s Detroit 67 Project and the Detroit Institute of Arts), we reached hundreds of thousands of Detroiters. We selected over 100 families to come in and share photo albums that spanned generations, and numerous global origins, to reveal the story of a frontier town that became one of the greatest cities in the nation and captured the imagination of the world and still has much to teach us about perseverance, hustle and triumph over challenges. 

Detroit stories were shared by a diverse cast of characters coming from all corners of the city - East Side, West Side, from downtown to 8 Mile. Some of our on-location character interviews included, among many others, industrial artist Tim Burke, Marsha Music - daughter of legendary pre-Motown record producer Joe Von-Battle, Paul Wasserman - owner of Henry the Hatter the oldest hat retailer in the US, and local historian, Baba Jamon Jordan.

The characters live in a ""90's world"" breaking a traditional linear timeline, which allows for any and all 90's events in pop culture, fashion, music and movies.Now, you might be sitting at your computer desk wondering why I referenced found footage horror flicks. Well, I'll let you in on a little secret:Each camcorder is operated entirely by one of the character's in the series. We see ONLY what the camera sees and fortunately for us, a camera has no filter and we come to realize...Evil reigns in the form of teenage girl. The year is 1995. Instagram is still 15+ years away and social media apps have yet to create a vast window into each others lives. We must find other ways to entertain ourselves, suppress our hardened insecurities and build up our hungry egos because, well...we're still human, right? But how will we do so without poking, liking, DMing or commenting. How will we show someone we like or dislike, approve or disapprove of their every move?We build followers.And NO I'm not talking about the ones who like the #foodporn you post every morning before you dig into your Egg McMuffin.I'm talking about the OG followers. The ones who ""suppress our hardened insecurities and feed our hungry egos""...in REAL life. And we call thatTHE GROUP PHENOMENONAccording to StopBullying.gov : Bullying is not usually a simple interaction between a student who bullies and a student who is bullied. Instead, it often involves groups of students who support each other in bullying other students.Even today, 49% of children in grades 4-12 reported being bullied by other students at school at least once during the past month, whereas 30.8% reported bullying others during that time. 
PAYING MY CAST & CREW. I cannot tell you how important it is to me, to give back to the people who have made this all possible.
Securing locations.
90's props (anyone got a bop-it?!)
Wardrobe and Accessories (this sh!t ain't cheap).

The creation of Rachel's Birthday, Season One will indefinitely help us get the word out and continue on in the hopes of a second season. We are shooting for the moon and we would not have such faith in ourselves if it wasn't for your love and support. We are so thankful for you. So with that being said, HAPPY HUNTING & we look forward to crawling into a 90's coma with you. xoxo. P.S.

<li>A genderqueer main character!</li>

<h2>What We Need </h2>
<p>So right now we have what we need to create a basic quality show, but we want to go above and beyond the basics. In the interest of complete transparency, here's what your money will be going towards.</p>
<ul>
<li>$500 - Equipment. Lights, a camera, an external hard-drive, and Adobe subscription.</li>
<li>$250 - Art/Music. We've reached out to three amazingly talented artists who are each designing a logo for one of the three Legacy Leagues, and one wonderful graphic designer who is designing the show and university logos. We are still searching for our perfect fit musician, but we'd like to be able to pay them too. </li>
<li>$300 - Actors. We appreciate the hard work our actors are putting in to this project but we recognize that love of acting does not pay bills, money does.</li>
<li>$150 - Set Dressing. We want to turn a basic room into Carson's dream dorm.</li>
<li>$200 - Incidentals. We're no stranger to this business. We recognize that something is going to go wrong five minutes in to filming, and this is how we combat that.</li>
<li>$100 - Craft Services. Well fed and watered actors and crew are the keys to a successful production. </li>
<li>$500 - Perk Fulfillment. If you pay for something you should get that something. </li>
</ul>
<p>We wanted to put the ""FUN"" in FUNdraiser, by choosing perks that were affordable for us to produce, yet enjoyable for you. If we do not meet our goal, paying our artists, actors and musicians is our number one priority, because we value their efforts. From there we move down the essentials list: better lighting, better camera, set design, etc. </p>

<h2>Why This Story?</h2>
<p><u><strong>Sorin (Queer|they/them) - Writer/Producer/Actor </strong></u></p>
<p>I started writing this story for one major reason. Representation. It seemed like, from where I was sitting, that there were only a handful of LGBT+ characters, and even fewer non-binary or gender non-conforming characters. And when they did show up, especially in YA literature, they only showed up in the context of discovering who they were or falling in love. Stories were never about a genderqueer character going off on an adventure through a magical forest to save the day, or piloting a ship through a dystopian wasteland. As an older sibling, I didn't like the idea that my siblings wouldn't have access to good quality representation if they ever went through the same processes I did, so I decided to change that. Once my mind was made up, I just had to add in my real-life love for mythology and a story was born!</p>
<p><strong><u>Eli (Gay|he/him) - Director/Actor</u></strong></p>
<p>This project is rad because it tells stories that we know in one way but tells it fresh and new. It puts LGBTQIA+ voices and perspectives front and center. It's the first time I've gotten to be a part of a big artistic project from the very beginning though all the stages in a long time, and that's just really cool.</p>
<p><strong><u>Faith (Lesbian|she/her) - Production Manager</u></strong></p>
<p>Many LBGT+ people, myself included, relied on the internet to help us through our self discovery. Most have that moment where they first recognize themselves in a character. That moment where a character says something that speaks to you on a deeper level than anything any character has ever said before. That moment where you start to realize why you feel so different. I love the idea on working on a show that could be that moment for some other young person. That is why I am so pumped to be working on this show!</p>

<h3>WHAT IS <i>BROWN</i>?</h3>
<p>We live in a world where marginalized groups are finally getting their time in the sun. Society is changing, and with it our standards. Television is beginning to reflect real life.</p>
<p><i>BROWN</i> is the latest installment of the coming-of-age ensemble comedy, the newest generation of <i>Friends</i>, if they were all sassy, emotionally damaged people of color who are more codependent on their iPhones than they are with each other.</p>
<p>The show follows Omar and Olive, two black siblings in constant competition with one another, and their friends:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jack, a painfully shy Latinx nerd.</li>
<li>Beau, a Polynesian surfer/stoner and resident Adonis, and,</li>
<li>Daisy: no nonsense, ambiguously Asian, and killing everyone with kindness.</li>
</ul>
<p>Together they tackle issues of race, identity and sexuality, all while trying to support each other and redefine what it means to really be a family.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>WHY <i>BROWN?</i>
</h3>
<p>It seems like everywhere you look now, there’s a show about plucky minorities rearing its head. To some this is overkill. To us? It’s what we deserve. Reparations, if you will, for years of constant exposure to the nuclear family.</p>
<p>For many of the members of the crew, we yearned to see faces that looked like ours when we were growing up. The lack thereof can be supremely damaging to a young mind. <i>BROWN</i> has a way of celebrating the beauty and differences of disparate cultures without making it a huge deal. It’s just life. A little crazy, a little offbeat, and yeah: more than just black and white.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>WHO'S ON DECK?</h3>
<p><strong>OLYVIA SCOTT</strong> is the creator of <i>BROWN</i>, as well as the director and writer of the pilot. She has been working on <i>BROWN</i> since her freshman year of college and is now entering her senior year (whew!).  Olyvia’s favorite character is Beau, but for inexplicable reasons is probably most like Olive.</p>
<p><strong>DANIELLA FERNANDEZ</strong> is the director of photography. A talented, writer, photographer and painter (double whew), Daniella is a proud Gemini and identifies the most with Jack. Since graduating from SCAD in 2017 with a degree in Film &amp; Television, Daniella has been instrumental in the development of <i>BROWN</i> and is eager to bring the characters to life onscreen!</p>
<p><strong>DEONNA GIBBS</strong>, assistant director, Leo. DeOnna studies Dramatic Writing, Photography and Music Composition (triple whew) and is in her senior year as well. She identifies as the female version of Omar and, should the moment arise, is prepared to play him at the drop of a hat. She intends to pursue playwriting after all is said and done, but for now is content in the <i>BROWN</i> writer’s room.</p>
<p><strong>CASSIDY HAYNES</strong> is producer and head gyal in charge. Her boundless energy and optimism is rivaled only by anime heroines, and we are forever grateful to be harnessing a human Energizer bunny on this project. Haynes is studying Dramatic Writing like DeOnna, is a proud Libra (as is Olyvia), and loves every character to death. (Olive is her favorite despite the fact that she refuses to choose.)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>HOW YOU CAN HELP</h3>
<p><i>BROWN</i> is being funded independently. Like our charming band of characters, the creators of the show are broke twentysomethings that just need a little help from their friends.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal is <strong>$5,000</strong>. And that’s quite a bit on paper. But as this is a passion project years in the making, we want it done right. However, this is a flexible goal.</p>
<p><strong>$1,000 will get our foot in the door.</strong><br/>This will get us enough to film a quick proof of concept, one that we can feel good about showing. With $1K, all backers will receive their perks and we’ll be able to give you all a taste of the characters and the show as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>$2,5000 will get us halfway there!</strong><br/>$2.5K can help us shoot and edit approximately half of the pilot.</p>
<p><strong>$5,000? Say no more.</strong><br/>With our full budget, the creators of BROWN can produce a fully fleshed out pilot, one that we can send to festivals and present to production companies. Production will start in the fall and the final cut will be released in 2019.</p>
<h3>WHERE IS MY MONEY GOING?</h3>
<p>The money we raise will go 100% towards the execution of BROWN. But since we’re perfectionists, here’s a breakdown of costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Locations:</strong> It all starts somewhere!</li>
<li>
<strong>Production Design:</strong> Costumes, make-up, props, and set dress are important elements in their own right. We want to make sure our cast and the locations look their best.</li>
<li>
<strong>Equipment:</strong> Cameras, lighting, and sound are going to be imperative to making this pilot the best it can be.</li>
<li>
<strong>Food, food, food:</strong> We’ve all got mouths to feed. And for our full days on set, we want to make sure that our cast and crew are happy and healthy.</li>
<li>
<strong>Post and Promo:</strong> Even after the cameras stop rolling, we’ve got footage to edit and a film to promote! This will help us polish the final cut and send it on its way when we’re finished. (This also includes the perks we’ll be sending out *gasp* TO YOU!)</li>
<li><strong>Accidentals, artistic promotion and miscellaneous needs.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Those Indiegogo fees!</strong></li>
</ul>

DANIELLA FERNANDEZ is the director of photography. A talented, writer, photographer and painter (double whew), Daniella is a proud Gemini and identifies the most with Jack. Since graduating from SCAD in 2017 with a degree in Film & Television, Daniella has been instrumental in the development of BROWN and is eager to bring the characters to life onscreen!
DEONNA GIBBS, assistant director, Leo. DeOnna studies Dramatic Writing, Photography and Music Composition (triple whew) and is in her senior year as well. She identifies as the female version of Omar and, should the moment arise, is prepared to play him at the drop of a hat. She intends to pursue playwriting after all is said and done, but for now is content in the BROWN writer’s room.
CASSIDY HAYNES is producer and head gyal in charge. Her boundless energy and optimism is rivaled only by anime heroines, and we are forever grateful to be harnessing a human Energizer bunny on this project. Haynes is studying Dramatic Writing like DeOnna, is a proud Libra (as is Olyvia), and loves every character to death. (Olive is her favorite despite the fact that she refuses to choose.)

HOW YOU CAN HELP
BROWN is being funded independently. Like our charming band of characters, the creators of the show are broke twentysomethings that just need a little help from their friends.
The ultimate goal is $5,000. And that’s quite a bit on paper. But as this is a passion project years in the making, we want it done right. However, this is a flexible goal.
$1,000 will get our foot in the door.This will get us enough to film a quick proof of concept, one that we can feel good about showing. With $1K, all backers will receive their perks and we’ll be able to give you all a taste of the characters and the show as a whole.
$2,5000 will get us halfway there!$2.5K can help us shoot and edit approximately half of the pilot.
$5,000? Say no more.With our full budget, the creators of BROWN can produce a fully fleshed out pilot, one that we can send to festivals and present to production companies. Production will start in the fall and the final cut will be released in 2019.
WHERE IS MY MONEY GOING?
The money we raise will go 100% towards the execution of BROWN. But since we’re perfectionists, here’s a breakdown of costs:


Locations: It all starts somewhere!

Production Design: Costumes, make-up, props, and set dress are important elements in their own right. We want to make sure our cast and the locations look their best.

Equipment: Cameras, lighting, and sound are going to be imperative to making this pilot the best it can be.

Food, food, food: We’ve all got mouths to feed. And for our full days on set, we want to make sure that our cast and crew are happy and healthy.

Post and Promo: Even after the cameras stop rolling, we’ve got footage to edit and a film to promote! This will help us polish the final cut and send it on its way when we’re finished. (This also includes the perks we’ll be sending out *gasp* TO YOU!)
Accidentals, artistic promotion and miscellaneous needs.
Those Indiegogo fees!

<h2>ABOUT SYCAMORE VALLEY--</h2>
<p>Hello! Let me introduce myself. My name is Marisa Luz and I am the writer/director/producer of Sycamore Valley. If you haven't already seen <a href=""https://youtu.be/sPuTkRoS7Vg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Season 1</a> you can check it out at <a href=""http://sycamorevalleyshow.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">sycamorevalleyshow.com</a>. </p>
<p>What is Sycamore Valley? It's a mockumentary about two rival realtors in an idyllic Southern California suburb. Our first season follows first-time home-buyers, Kayla and Curtis, as they navigate the pitfalls of finding their first home. In our second season the stakes are higher, with fun new characters, and lots more Cece and Simon drama. Everyone is hungry to see more of their rivalry, so we're delivering! </p>
<p>Before starting season 1, I had no clue what was involved in putting together a production--time or budget wise. Both were a lot more than I bargained for. All I had was blind ambition, and a concept that I was passionate about, to keep pushing me through when times got tough. And in the end, I came out with a product and story I'm really proud of, and something that viewers really enjoyed (and a Best Series and Best Actor festival win to boot!) The enthusiasm from our fans has given me the energy to have another crack at it, and see if I can't make something even bigger and funnier while I continue to grow as a writer and filmmaker. </p>
</div><div>
<h2>WHY WE'RE RAISING FUNDS--</h2>
<p>We had such an amazing response from our families, friends, friends of friends...so we want to involve you! All donations to this campaign will go toward including our fans in some form or fashion.</p>
<p>It should go without saying that filmmaking is expensive, so to be able to bring on board the people and locations that will expand our Sycamore Valley universe, we need some help. </p>
<p>Your donation will go toward:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Crew and Equipment</strong> - Let me tell you I (naively) tried to shoot this show on my iPhone, and 100% this needs to be left in the hands of the experts. Your eyes and ears will be grateful.</li>
<li>
<strong>Location Rentals</strong> - This show is all about houses, and we need to transport our viewers into the Sycamore Valley world with locations that will help tell our story. </li>
<li>
<strong>Insurance</strong> - Zzzzz. Did I lose you? This is the boring side of filmmaking, but our fancy equipment and location rentals all require insurance in case any of the Cece/Simon cat-fights get out of hand. </li>
</ul>
<h2>WHAT IF YOU EXCEED YOUR GOAL?</h2>
<p>Our current goal is set to about 50% of the show's total budget. There's so much more that needs to be paid for. If we go over and above our goal your contribution will help secure the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Actors Salary</strong> - These lines don't learn themselves, people! Our actors take pride in transforming themselves into the characters you see on screen, and while it looks like a lot of fun, it's also incredibly hard-work. </li>
<li>
<strong>Production Assistant</strong> - We need all the hands we can get on set, and having one more person to help us out would make a huge difference in getting everything done our limited time frame. </li>
<li>
<strong>Food for Cast and Crew</strong> - No shrinking violets on this set! A happy cast and crew are a well fed cast and crew, and we need to keep everyone strong to get through our long days.</li>
<li>
<strong>Editing and Color</strong> - You don't want to see what I would come up with tinkering in iMovie. This, too, should be left to the professionals. </li>
<li>
<strong>Animations</strong> - We have a talented animator we'd love to hire again to keep our opening credits fresh, unique and exciting. They're one of my favorite parts of our show. </li>
<li>
<strong>Wardrobe and Props</strong> - A major part of our world-building are the small details that you may not notice otherwise, but are critical to the storytelling. </li>
<li>
<strong>BTS Photographer </strong>- Behind the scenes images make a huge difference in promoting and marketing our show. We would love to have an extra person on set to capture our fun filming moments for social media and festival press-kits. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h2>A SINCERE THANK YOU-- </h2>
<p>Asking for a monetary donation is not something easy to do, nor do I take this ask lightly, so before you hit the donate button, or even if you don't, I want to thank you for supporting this project. Even if that support is just with your eyeballs, watching Season 1 over-and-over again to get our view counts up on youtube. My ego really appreciates it.</p>
</div><div>
<h2>UNABLE TO CONTRIBUTE AT THIS TIME? </h2>
<p>If you're unable to donate for whatever reason, but still want to help support Sycamore Valley, here's a few ways how you can help!</p>
<ul>
<li>Send this campaign to your indie film-loving friends and family!  </li>
<li>Donate in-kind services or skills:<ul>
<li>BTS Photographer looking to build their portfolio.</li>
<li>Hair and make-up looking for IMDB credit/experience.</li>
<li>Etc., etc. You get the idea! =)</li>

And in the end, I came out with a product and story I'm really proud of, and something that viewers really enjoyed (and a Best Series and Best Actor festival win to boot!) The enthusiasm from our fans has given me the energy to have another crack at it, and see if I can't make something even bigger and funnier while I continue to grow as a writer and filmmaker. 

WHY WE'RE RAISING FUNDS--
We had such an amazing response from our families, friends, friends of friends...so we want to involve you! All donations to this campaign will go toward including our fans in some form or fashion.
It should go without saying that filmmaking is expensive, so to be able to bring on board the people and locations that will expand our Sycamore Valley universe, we need some help. 
Your donation will go toward:


Crew and Equipment - Let me tell you I (naively) tried to shoot this show on my iPhone, and 100% this needs to be left in the hands of the experts. Your eyes and ears will be grateful.

Location Rentals - This show is all about houses, and we need to transport our viewers into the Sycamore Valley world with locations that will help tell our story. 

Insurance - Zzzzz. Did I lose you? This is the boring side of filmmaking, but our fancy equipment and location rentals all require insurance in case any of the Cece/Simon cat-fights get out of hand. 

WHAT IF YOU EXCEED YOUR GOAL?
Our current goal is set to about 50% of the show's total budget. There's so much more that needs to be paid for. If we go over and above our goal your contribution will help secure the following:


Actors Salary - These lines don't learn themselves, people! Our actors take pride in transforming themselves into the characters you see on screen, and while it looks like a lot of fun, it's also incredibly hard-work. 

Production Assistant - We need all the hands we can get on set, and having one more person to help us out would make a huge difference in getting everything done our limited time frame. 

Food for Cast and Crew - No shrinking violets on this set! A happy cast and crew are a well fed cast and crew, and we need to keep everyone strong to get through our long days.

Editing and Color - You don't want to see what I would come up with tinkering in iMovie. This, too, should be left to the professionals. 

Animations - We have a talented animator we'd love to hire again to keep our opening credits fresh, unique and exciting. They're one of my favorite parts of our show. 

Wardrobe and Props - A major part of our world-building are the small details that you may not notice otherwise, but are critical to the storytelling. 

BTS Photographer - Behind the scenes images make a huge difference in promoting and marketing our show. We would love to have an extra person on set to capture our fun filming moments for social media and festival press-kits. 


A SINCERE THANK YOU-- 
Asking for a monetary donation is not something easy to do, nor do I take this ask lightly, so before you hit the donate button, or even if you don't, I want to thank you for supporting this project. Even if that support is just with your eyeballs, watching Season 1 over-and-over again to get our view counts up on youtube. My ego really appreciates it.

UNABLE TO CONTRIBUTE AT THIS TIME? 
If you're unable to donate for whatever reason, but still want to help support Sycamore Valley, here's a few ways how you can help!

Send this campaign to your indie film-loving friends and family!  
Donate in-kind services or skills:
BTS Photographer looking to build their portfolio.
Hair and make-up looking for IMDB credit/experience.

<p><i>Connie The Conjurer</i>  is the story of Connie Caldwell, a young, violin-playing, shy girl from California.  Her loving parents noticed early signs that Connie possessed the family gift of magic, and they decided that her eccentric grandma, “Mimi”, was the one to teach Connie all about it. So off Connie went to live with Mimi, down south, in the spooky town of Port Murky, Louisiana.  Port Murky is inhabited by so many ghosts that it puts any haunted mansion to shame. Mimi feels that Connie can become a conjurer in time.  Before that, Connie must learn to control her power to conjure spirits, to copy the ability of ghosts and to cast a proper spell.</p>
<p>Gaining supernatural powers isn’t the only thing that Connie faces. Connie has to manage her own “Social Anxiety” that keeps her from connecting to others which she so desperately wants. Moving to a new town is challenging for anybody, but especially so for Connie, whose fear of being judged keeps her from doing what she wants.  </p>
<p>Luckily for her, Connie isn’t alone on this adventure. With Mimi's guidance and a colorful bunch of new paranormal friends, Connie embarks on a mission to help every spirit in Port Murky and help herself become the person she wants to be.</p>

<p>Connie The Conjurer is a series that deals with a variety of timely messages. While it may be a fun and spooky show, at its core it exposes how a child with social anxiety navigates the world. The real dilemma in this show doesn’t come from  ghosts or monsters, but instead from Connie's own inhibitions.  How she accepts herself and how others accept her ""otherness"" is a message that speaks to how diversity of every kind ought to be valued.</p>
<p>Battling social anxiety is personal for series creator, James Fairbanks IV. At Connie’s age, James grew up with social challenges and worked through them to find peer connections. Connie is a character that anybody can relate to, because everyone has entered a room not knowing what to say or do. Connie's vulnerability and honesty resonates deeply within each of our hearts. </p>

The music for Connie The Conjurer  will be created by film composer Bethany Brinton. Bethany has composed short film scores and collaborated on many projects, including Season 2 of Milo Murphy's Law , and several live acts with the creators of Disney's Phineas and Ferb. She has performed with many professional ensembles in a wide variety of genres, both in the U.S. and abroad.
 

 
Our story takes place in the fun, but freaky town of Port Murky, Louisiana. Every nook and cranny is full of activity for both the living as well as the dead! Including its many seaports, historic buildings, and endless places to eat, Port Murky  is a home for just about everyone. 
Port Murky is inspired by the historic and mysterious setting of New Orleans, Louisiana. It is a melting pot of many different cultures and traditions dating back hundreds of years. Think of Port Murky as an expanded version of everything that makes New Orleans unique. People come far and wide to witness not only the history the town provides, but also its endless variety of tasty dishes from every culture imaginable.

Aside from the history, you will find an endless amount of apartments all older than its current inhabitants. Every apartment includes a themed business beneath it, including local shops, ancient markets turned into restaurants, and even voodoo shops both catering to tourists and practicing magic for themselves. 
As mentioned before, Port Murky is a town rich with history, meaning thousands of spirits from all different time periods call Port Murky home. Every kind of ghost from Poltergeists and Banshees to Phantoms and Doppelgängers can be found in Port Murky’s eventful and dark history. This is the backdrop for Connie to explore as she becomes the remedy for every spirit with unfinished business, and there’s a lot of them!",25.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Short Summary</h2>
<p>Hello! We’re Little Doors Media LLC, the creators of <strong><i>Ghosted</i></strong> an internet anthology that explores the social phenomena and impact of one of the dating world’s most pervasive trends: ghosting - the practice of abruptly ending a relationship without any communication or explanation; effectively ‘disappearing’ in the eyes of an unsuspecting partner, or would-be partner.</p>
<p>What’s so unique about <i><strong>Ghosted</strong></i> is that each episode is inspired by and crafted around the deeply personal experience of someone who wanted to share their story. These experiences are compelling because the act of ghosting is not always what it may appear to be on the surface; sometimes it’s a necessary act of self-preservation, or profoundly harrowing and involuntary. Our stories range from from heartwarming, to fateful, and even the downright bizarre; while simultaneously exploring a host social issues such as: LGBTQA acceptance and rights, domestic violence, and even sexual assault.</p>
<h3>About Little Doors Media LLC</h3>
<p>Little Doors Media is an independent film production company that specializes in new media entertainment. Wholly student-owned and operated by a passionate group of volunteers, the Los Angeles based company is committed to delivering riveting, yet meaningful original content. You can learn more about us at <a href=""http://www.littledoorsmedia.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.littledoorsmedia.com</a></p>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>In order to deliver a sensational first season of <i><strong>Ghosted</strong></i>, we aim to raise at least $25,000 to meet our estimated production budget. While we may be volunteers, we still  have real costs such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Insurance</strong> – Accidents happen, and we want to make sure that our cast and crew are covered and protected, in the event anyone is hurt on set.</li>
<li>
<strong>Permits </strong>– Would you really want us filming in your backyard without permission?</li>
<li>
<strong>Equipment &amp; Rentals</strong> – Lighting, sound, cameras – the list goes on. Technology has come a long way, and while it’s possible we could film the series on our smartphones, we think you and the rest of our audience deserve a quality viewing experience.</li>
<li>
<strong>Food </strong>– Everyone has to eat, and actors are no different. It’s important to feed our cast and crew on the days that we’re filming; otherwise, they’ll get hangry and their performance will suffer.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What’s in it for you?</h3>
<p>For our contributors, we are offering a variety of perks; including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shout-outs on social media and our website!</li>
<li>‘Special Thanks’ in episode credits, series credits, or even on IMDb!</li>
<li>Exclusive early access to our pilot episode!</li>
<li>An opportunity to walk the red carpet at our Hollywood premier!</li>
</ul>
<p>And so much more… check out our full list  of perks.</p>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>In today's political climate, we feel it is imperative for those with a platform to exploit it; using ours, we plan make sure that these stories are told; not for our own gain, but rather to raise awareness to the issues of sexual and domestic abuse, ghosting, and an ever-eroding sense of empathy.  That's why, we are donating any and all net proceeds remaining from production to <strong>RAINN </strong>(Rape, Abuse, Incest, National Network), the nation’s largest anti-sexual violence non-profit organization.</p>
<p>Through funding our project, not only will Little Doors Media give back by donating our net proceeds, but it enables our audience and contributors the opportunity and incentive to change lives by supporting <strong>RAINN</strong> - an amazing organization, with a truly noble cause. </p>
<p>If you or someone you know is a victim of sexual violence, please call the National Sexual Assault Hotline. It's free, open 24/7, and confidential. 1-800-656-HOPE  or visit <a href=""http://www.rainn.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.rainn.org</a></p>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>Every project presents its own set of risks and challenges; for us, the biggest challenges are securing quality locations, and raising enough capital to film all 10 episodes. But fear not, we assure your contribution will not go to waste; we are 100% committed to producing <i><strong>Ghosted</strong></i> and delivering as many episodes as our contributions allow. Check out our FAQs for more details. </p>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>Here at Little Doors Media, we're all students and volunteers, so we understand you might only be able to donate a couple of dollars; and not everyone has the ability to contribute financially - that’s ok! Still, we’d be forever grateful if you would take a few seconds to help  spread the word about <i><strong>Ghosted</strong></i> by sharing our campaign via Indiegogo share tools, or even just by telling a friend.</p>
<p>We hope you’ll join us in making the <i><strong>Ghosted</strong></i> webs-series a reality, and thank you for being a part of our story.</p>

The show tells the story of a post college black millennial and aspiring writer, who navigates through life attempting to find herself and avoid reckless behavior. It is loosely based on my life and its purpose is to create something millennials can relate to that also showcases the beauty and culture of the Bay Area. I am passionate about black storytelling, because I feel that it is important that our voices are heard and our stories are accurately told.</p>
<p>Although it is very uncomfortable for me to request help, I am aware that I must put my pride aside, because it takes a village. After digging myself into debt, working seven days a week and doing various freelance projects to gain extra income, I now realize that I can no longer solely depend on myself to fully fund my projects. </p>
<p>Through my web series, I have given opportunities to aspiring actors, up and coming musical artists and promoted a number of black owned businesses. In addition, Reckless Behavior: The Series has been mentioned on popular Bay Area radio station 106.1 KMEL, it has been featured on many blogs and podcasts and it has been selected for viewing at the 2020 Pan African Film and Arts Festival, the largest and most prestigious black film festival in America.</p>
<p>If you want to support a young Black woman who is passionate about creating content for us and by us, please donate anything you can. I want to continue this filmmaking journey, but I need your help.</p>

<h3><strong>​Who We Are</strong></h3>
<p>You're probably asking yourself, ""why would I want to support this project?"" Well, let me help you understand a little more about who we are and what we stand for:</p>
<p>Ginamarie and Olivia here, we are a Mother/Daughter Duo (more like best friends, if we're honest).  We began writing this series so that families would come together again in the living room.</p>
<p>Our desire is to bring a wholesome, family-friendly TV series to your home weekly. We want parents and children to feel comfortable watching TV together, without worrying what might be heard or seen.</p>
<h3><strong>What is Abbott Falls?</strong></h3>
<p>Think of Gilmore Girls for the small town feel, which creates the ability to have close-knit relationships and of course, coffee addictions.</p>
<p>Abbott Falls truly is unlike any show currently on the air today. Abbott Falls is a wholesome, family-friendly, hour-long drama centered on the town of Abbott Falls, but more specifically, the Kennedy Family.</p>
<p>Throughout the series, the Kennedy family will face unexpected events as their world is turned upside down by a troubled foreign exchange student, the reveal of shocking family secrets, and the destruction of various relationships. They will have to learn to trust each other and depend upon their faith. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>
<strong>What We Need</strong> </h3>
<p>I believe in being totally transparent. We need YOU! The father, mother, grandparents, millennials, Generation Xer's, college students, high school and middle school students and even the very young at heart. </p>
<p>This pilot will cost us nearly $200,000.  I know, that's a lot of money. I feel you. I'm digging deep into my pockets for this tv show as well. Each dollar contributed to Abbott Falls TV series will be spent on the production of the pilot episode.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Each episode of Abbott Falls will impact you and your family. It's time for families to enjoy being a family. To be laughing and crying together. Talking about real life and sharing in each other's joy. </p>

<p>Can you imagine what it would be like to go from your life right now to suddenly living underground <span>24/7</span> with four strangers in a tiny bunker; and anytime you stick your head outside there are <span>6</span> billion zombies trying to eat you? And then try to think of all the ways you might entertain yourself so you don’t go crazy.</p>
<p>That’s the crux of Bunkheads. We wanted to take the characters and situations you find in a sitcom and place them into a world they've never been before. Over the course of a season, we pit these diverse goofballs against each other in ways that resonate in today’s America and ultimately help them forge a new kind of family.</p>
<p>Bunkheads is more than just a web series; it’s an opportunity to join our gang of merry pranksters and watch a show that we can laugh at together, despite all the chaos in the world. Feels appropriate, right?</p>
<p>It's also an opportunity to support the filmmakers + cast, and help us showcase the kind of original work we can create after years and years of honing our crafts.</p>
<p>And it's not just us who think so! The online video news site Tubefilter recommended Bunkheads as their <i>Fund This</i> of the week:</p>

<p>Unlike a novel or a painting where one person can create art with some basic tools (and a whole lot of magic), making a film or a web series requires a whole mess of people. We already have an army of friends donating their time and equipment but, to create something truly special, we are going to need money.</p>
<p>We need cameras, equipment, food, and most importantly we need a bunker! It’s not like we can just borrow one or head over to our local mall and find a “Build-A-Bunker Workshop.” Nope! From the fake walls to furniture, we are going to have to build a bunker from scratch and rent a space to put it in.</p>
<p>Not only that, but we are creating a 6-episode season. Although any one episode can be funny, what makes TV special is the progression of story and characters over time and the way we let them into our lives.</p>

</div></div>","Can you imagine what it would be like to go from your life right now to suddenly living underground 24/7 with four strangers in a tiny bunker; and anytime you stick your head outside there are 6 billion zombies trying to eat you? And then try to think of all the ways you might entertain yourself so you don’t go crazy.
That’s the crux of Bunkheads. We wanted to take the characters and situations you find in a sitcom and place them into a world they've never been before. Over the course of a season, we pit these diverse goofballs against each other in ways that resonate in today’s America and ultimately help them forge a new kind of family.
Bunkheads is more than just a web series; it’s an opportunity to join our gang of merry pranksters and watch a show that we can laugh at together, despite all the chaos in the world. Feels appropriate, right?
It's also an opportunity to support the filmmakers + cast, and help us showcase the kind of original work we can create after years and years of honing our crafts.
And it's not just us who think so! The online video news site Tubefilter recommended Bunkheads as their Fund This of the week:
   https://tinyurl.com/y8opz8gs
""All signs point to this project being a polished an enjoyable one, full of relatable characters who have been shoved into an unusual setting. Bunkheads has all the makings of a quality web series..."" 


Will Gong is an LA based writer, producer, and award-winning editor hailing from the great state of Virginia. Over the past fifteen years, he has been privileged to work with some of the finest studios around town on projects such as Star Wars, Straight Outta Compton, CNN’s The Sixties, and The Concert for Valor. Will has taken all the advice and experience he’s learned in Hollywood and put it all into this project.
 

Lauren Klixbull is a director, commercial art director, and oil painter. Her work includes several Super Bowl commercials, feature films, and branded content for Smashbox makeup, PopSugar.com, Lowe’s, Macy's, and Target. This Pittsburgh native and Carnegie Mellon University graduate has never once let up from her goal of directing scripted material, and she is in the perfect place to direct the hell out of Bunkheads.
 

Gabriel Reiter has produced countless commercial projects, on budgets ranging from pennies to millions of dollars, for well-known brands including Walmart, Tide, Wendy’s, and Starbucks. He’s well-versed in web content having produced “Raising An Olympian”, a heralded branded documentary series that screened at the Cannes Lions International Film Festival and attracted over 25 million views online. Gabriel is ready to muster all of his producing talent and his Miami Hurricanes pride to bring this project to life.


Khalif Boyd is from Lakewood, CA  aka Sports Illustrated’s “Sportstown of the Year” in 2004 (seriously, look it up). After playing semi-pro basketball in Costa Rica, Khalif began acting through collaborations with notable YouTube influencers. Khalif is currently creating content for YouTube with David So Comedy and writing an autobiographical film called Vinegar, about his unique Vietnamese and Black identity.
 

Currently living in LA, Chris is originally from Rhode Island. With over a decade of experience, Chris's trademark ability to find the humor hidden in drama and the vulnerability behind comedy has helped him land roles in every genre on every media platform. Look for Chris as Mark in the upcoming horror film, Found Footage 3D.
 

Carly Turro is a bicoastal actor, screenwriter, and slightly obsessive pet-parent. Shortly after graduating from Colgate University with a degree in Biology, she decided to put it to excellent use by instead pursuing acting. Most recently appearing on Homeland, she can soon be seen starring in the horror/comedy feature film Blood Puppet! Christmas ’94, and several other festival-bound films.
 

Josh Covitt is from San Diego and is a graduate of the UCLA School of Theatre, Film, and Television. His work spans TV, film, theatre, and live comedy, including performances with Will Farrell, Luke Wilson, Mindy Kaling, Eva Longoria, and Luke Perry. In 2011, Josh was voted the winner of IO West's The Ultimate X-ecution: The Search for LA's Best Improviser. He currently performs every Tuesday night at UCB in L.A.
 

Alexandra Johnston is from Portland, Oregon and is known for her work as Cynthia Maddox in Amazon's American Playboy: The Hugh Hefner Story, Megan in feature film The Big Day, and Hannah in the west coast premier of Sex and Education at The Laguna Playhouse. 

    Episode 1 - ""This is the Place” 
On their one-year anniversary of living together, the Bunkheads debate whether or not their situation is sustainable and if it’s better to risk their lives topside with the zombies still ravaging the Earth. As they debate, we learn more about them, how they came together, and discover who created the bunker in the first place.  
    Episode 2 - “Touch of My Hand”
A bit fed up with the boys and seeing an opportunity, Dani persuades the guys to leave the bunker so that she can have some “quality” time to herself. Out in the woods, Matt tries to keep the peace while Kip and Cash argue over who Dani is most attracted to.  
    Episode 3 - “Let Me Clear My Throat!”
Kip's never ending “Cold War” against Cash transforms into a full-blown conflict during the first “Bunkheads Presidential Debate.” It forces Cash into revealing some long-held secrets to the gang and everything comes to a head when a vote is taken to kick out one of the bunkmates! 
    Episode 4 - “Who’s That Girl?” 
Out in the real world, Kip discovers an attractive stranger, Blair, and brings her back to the bunker. The delicate equilibrium of their group dynamic is thrown out of whack and the Bunkheads have to decide whether to permanently invite Blair into their gang.  
    Episode 5 - ""Dreams""
Riding the coattails of the Sandman, we step inside each of the Bunkheads' minds for an episode that takes place entirely in sleep. Inside their dreams, we meet new characters, learn new secrets, and finally experience the full, majestic, and uncontainable glory of Kip’s first rap performance.  
    Episode 6 - “All My Friends” 
After two years of holding everyone together, Matt has a nervous breakdown. Kip, Cash, and Dani come together to try bring Matt back through the kind of zany skits that he loves to put on. Despite their best efforts, nothing seems to get through to him - that is, until Kip comes up with one last brilliant idea.

Unlike a novel or a painting where one person can create art with some basic tools (and a whole lot of magic), making a film or a web series requires a whole mess of people. We already have an army of friends donating their time and equipment but, to create something truly special, we are going to need money.
We need cameras, equipment, food, and most importantly we need a bunker! It’s not like we can just borrow one or head over to our local mall and find a “Build-A-Bunker Workshop.” Nope! From the fake walls to furniture, we are going to have to build a bunker from scratch and rent a space to put it in.
Not only that, but we are creating a 6-episode season. Although any one episode can be funny, what makes TV special is the progression of story and characters over time and the way we let them into our lives.


 
Perks! These, plus a whole lot more options to choose from on the panel to the right.

<p>Grettir Ásmundarsonar wants to make a name for himself as a warrior, but his violent temper and the curse of the revenant Glámur leads to a life on the margins of society as he becomes the most notorious outlaw in medieval Iceland.</p>
<p>This story takes place roughly 1,000 years ago. The book upon which this series is based was written about 700 years ago by an unknown author.</p>
<p>My name is Niles Maxwell. I am an American writer/director (and producer by default) living in southwest Germany. I have been making movies since I was 14 or 15 years old. Now I'm 48 and ready to finally produce and direct my first series, starting with this pilot episode.</p>
<p>I find the Grettir character to be a lonely, solitary figure, not unlike my own teenage years growing up. He feels misunderstood, and society has denied him what he truly wants, to make a name for himself as a great viking warrior. During the time this story takes place, the Viking Age was coming to an end, as Nordic peoples became Christianized. Yet Grettir aggressively takes action against injustice anyway, leading to the lonely life of an outlaw.</p>
<p>We know that J.R.R. Tolkien was influenced by the Icelandic sagas, as is apparent in similarities between Tolkien's work and this particular saga... in the names of the characters (Thorir Long-Chin, Bjorn the Hitardal Champion, Onund Tree-Foot, etc.), the types of monsters Grettir must battle (trolls, witches, revenants, etc.), the recurrence of singing or recitation of poetic verse and the adventurous nature of Grettir's long journey.</p>
<p>With your help, we can produce this pilot episode in Iceland and Norway, hopefully starting sometime in the winter of 2022. Because of the costumes, sets and remote locations, it is an enormous undertaking for a 45-minute episode.</p>
<p>We need close to €2 million to produce this pilot. We need Viking vessels, weapons, many costumes, and to pay a large professional cast and crew to shoot. As a contributor, you will remain informed about our progress, receive behind-the-scenes images and footage, have access to special communications with the cast or receive credit for your contribution, depending on your level of support. My team and I (see <a href=""http://www.bohemianentertainment.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.bohemianentertainment.com</a>) are working to finance this project by other means as well, and if we don't raise the €1.5 million on IndieGoGo, we'll continue to work toward getting the project financed by other means.</p>
<p>As a director/screenwriter, I take a collective approach to filmmaking. Making movies is hard work, but it's not all about the director's vision. It's about working together to achieve something special, to create art, to create stories that are powerful and meaningful... as well as entertaining. In our current time of economic and political upheaval, it is glaringly obvious that the myth that we can pull ourselves up by our own bootstraps as individuals is coming to a long-needed end. We have to work cooperatively to solve our very difficult challenges. So too in filmmaking -- I much prefer a cooperative experience as a team to any egocentric expressions of individual players.</p>
<p>My own background is like this... I am originally from Anchorage, Alaska. I started making movies with my neighborhood friends and my younger brother when I was 14 or 15, always remaining behind the camera. I hold a BA in English composition and an MFA in creative writing (with a concentration in screenwriting) and was on stage as an improv comedy actor for 4 years prior to switching into the film industry in 2006. So I have a strong appreciation for what actors bring to the table. I have written and co-produced (with a large team supporting me) one feature-length film thus far (see the trailer here: <a href=""https://vimeo.com/ondemand/halfbrothers"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://vimeo.com/ondemand/halfbrothers</a>).</p>
<p>Producing a film or pilot episode for a series is like organizing a large wedding every day that you shoot... if something can go wrong, it will go wrong. But I use my experience in improvisational theater to roll with the punches as they come. One can always find creative solutions to last-minute problems. In fact, I welcome such challenges, because sometimes they force me to come up with even better options than were initially planned. But my general approach to reducing the risk of failure is to do a great deal of planning ahead of time. Living in Germany has helped me in this regard, because the Germans are good at planning! That's why I'm giving myself two years to prepare this project -- it will take that long to get ready and make this pilot work at the quality we hope to achieve.</p>
<p>For those of you who can't contribute financially, we welcome your support to help create a following online through social media and other means. Spreading the word about this campaign will help us reach our goal. So please use the IndieGoGo sharing tools.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Greville Henwood and I am the Founder and Owner of GroovyKids™ Yoga. Since 2004, we've been teaching kids yoga all over the world and  have trained over 1,000 teachers to teach our method. </p>
<p>If yoga was available to them, kids would do it and their entire school experience would gain more balance.</p>
<p>We are shooting a full season of Yoga classes and every time you buy one, we'll gift a school somewhere. Gift the school half the year or the full year of classes!</p>
<ul>
<li>Kids love movement and yoga and <a href=""http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/more-than-just-a-game-yoga-for-school-age-children-201601299055"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">studies show</a> that the benefits are not limited to bodies but also their minds.</li>

<p>We've put together some unique perks to help you help us help the kids!</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Dalai Lama said if we teach kids to meditate, within one generation we will change the world. We think he's right. Everyone knows that kids have more stress, more pressure than ever before, so we've created something that helps.</p>
<p>Kids can learn things in a moment that they hold within for a lifetime. Our Shows are for all levels, all sizes, all backgrounds and all abilities. We teach life skills. Self acceptance, self awareness, and understanding. </p>
<p>In 2014 we made the pilot GroovyKids Yoga Show and it has sold in over 25 countries across the world. We've had letters from parents who said ""..my kids don't speak English and they didn't understand a word, but they did everything and they laughed a lot!""</p>
<p>We've seen kids everywhere delight in a fun and accessible yoga class that works them through a complete range of motion. From the ages of 4-10, we took four kids, two of whom had never even done yoga before, and we shot a live class. The joy and enthusiasm the kids had has inspired other kids all over the world.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with any project, there are risks. </p>
<p>What if the kids watch it and don't do anything?</p>
<p>In my 13 years of teaching kids yoga I have come to realize that some kids learn visually, some by reading, some by listening and in fact, even when a child is watching something, they are learning something. We have seen children watch our class a few times before joining in. So we're confident that by offering something compelling and zippy, the children will at some point join in of their own accord.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>We would love your help! We know that not everyone can contribute!</p>
<p>But you can still help and support us!</p>
<p>All you have to do is share this campaign. Help us find people who want to help kids!</p>

The Dalai Lama said if we teach kids to meditate, within one generation we will change the world. We think he's right. Everyone knows that kids have more stress, more pressure than ever before, so we've created something that helps.
Kids can learn things in a moment that they hold within for a lifetime. Our Shows are for all levels, all sizes, all backgrounds and all abilities. We teach life skills. Self acceptance, self awareness, and understanding. 
In 2014 we made the pilot GroovyKids Yoga Show and it has sold in over 25 countries across the world. We've had letters from parents who said ""..my kids don't speak English and they didn't understand a word, but they did everything and they laughed a lot!""
We've seen kids everywhere delight in a fun and accessible yoga class that works them through a complete range of motion. From the ages of 4-10, we took four kids, two of whom had never even done yoga before, and we shot a live class. The joy and enthusiasm the kids had has inspired other kids all over the world.
 

Risks & Challenges
As with any project, there are risks. 
What if the kids watch it and don't do anything?
In my 13 years of teaching kids yoga I have come to realize that some kids learn visually, some by reading, some by listening and in fact, even when a child is watching something, they are learning something. We have seen children watch our class a few times before joining in. So we're confident that by offering something compelling and zippy, the children will at some point join in of their own accord.

<h3>COMMUNE </h3>
<p>Right now we are saturated with politicized drama and global tensions in the media. I want to create a TV show that focuses on the positive actions being taken around the world. COMMUNE’S diverse and stunning locations will integrate visual storytelling while introducing concepts for cultivating resources from its environments such as an Urban Laboratory in Arizona, a spiritual retreat center in California, hand built dwellings in New Mexico, an artist compound in the High Desert, a tree house community in Bali, an “International City” in India, a monastery in China and a permaculture farm in Costa Rica.</p>
<p>For each episode, our core team will visit one location, documenting its architectural, agricultural, domestic and communal spaces. Coverage of workshops and new build outs will be part of the shoot schedule.</p>
<p>We will film discussions at communal meetings and conduct individual interviews. We will capture the synergy of recreational gatherings, people working outside and the therapeutic processes of herbal medicines and ceremonies.</p>

<p><strong>Betty Nguyen - Director / Creator</strong></p>
<p>Director and Host Betty Nguyen spent three months at Arcosanti, Arizona in 2016 where she came up with the idea for COMMUNE. “Your consciousness feels amplified when you reside in an intimate setting. I’d like to show the world how people are living, differently. We need a positive show right now. I want to be the next Anthony Bourdain - but instead of celebrating chefs and food, I’d like to promote sustainability.</p>
<p>Nguyen demonstrates a unique talent as a documentary filmmaker, industry production designer, seasoned writer, magazine editor, DJ and memorable personality. She has been tapped for several television gigs before, including MTV’s Real World in San Francisco (‘93), hosting both a network travel series and an interview talk show. Nguyen served as a director at MTV’s Think Tank for four years. Her documentary short film about Vietnam, “Bestiary of Nam,” was screened at the SF International Asian Film Festival, Hong Kong Film Festival and was part of Miranda July’s short film series.</p>
<p>Nguyen also has a deep passion for music spanning all genres: she directed music videos for artful, post-punk band, Chicks on Speed (‘01) and her first DJ gig was for the opening of the London Film Co-Op (‘00). Soon after, she toured with Aphex Twin throughout the Middle East. Most recently, she DJed at the Venice Beach Art Auction (‘17) with the Arabian Prince, a founding member of rap group NWA and secretly, one hell of a great stop motion animator.</p>
<p>She published First Person Magazine for nine years interviewing artists and writing travel pieces. She also hosted radio show “Burden of Dreams II” on cable radio. Nguyen has lived in New York, San Francisco, Tokyo, Paris and London and has shot on location in Asia and Europe. She currently resides in Ojai, California.</p>

<p>I'm psyched to share our trailer with you. Yuko and I spent 9 days in Slab City as part of the ""Sun Forts"" project led by Adam Zeek where several artists from Portland, New Orleans, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Joshua Tree built a shelter from scavenged materials together and gave it away. Slab City is an off-grid site founded in the '60's for veterans and is now an area an unincorporated city where one can live and build rent-free. It is located behind Salvation Mountain in Southern California where an estimated 60 people live. There is a hot spring that serves as a communal bath and every Friday night there is an open mic night so folks can gather together to build community. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey there! We’re the co-writers/directors of THE APPLICANT, a short film which you can watch below. For those of you who don’t know us, we’re friends and collaborators who have worked together since our days at USC Film School, on everything from short films to music videos and commercials. THE APPLICANT is the next step in our journey towards telling powerful, thrilling and thought-provoking stories.</p>
<p>The short:<br/></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/yEMyOlhe924?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p>We had such a positive response to the short (thank you, everyone!)-- it got us wondering if there was more of a story to tell. Once we sat down, we found there to be endless possibilities to explore the world that our characters are living in. How did Eric start doing what he does? Is he the only one? Where does he go from here? We got excited as we began to develop the intricate and nuanced world Eric lives in-- a world of questionable actions and immense power.</p>
<p>As a series, THE APPLICANT is a story of justice and redemption in a world where nothing is what it seems. It’s one part <i>Bourne Identity</i>, one part <i>House of Cards</i>.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>We’re looking to raise $8,000 towards the production. While we did fund The Applicant short entirely on our own, unfortunately, we cannot fund the series ourselves. The $8,000 will be going towards our talented crew, camera equipment, lights, locations, permits, food, insurance and other production costs. We’ll be shooting over five days in a variety of locations that open up the world far beyond what you see in the short, and we’re eager to put every dollar up on screen!</p>

<p>We are also honored that our incredibly talented and a joy to work with crew will be joining us again. Our Director of Photography, Ana Amortegui, whose gorgeous visuals have been seen on TV shows such as <i>Veep</i> and most recently, <i>Gente-fied</i>, a web-series produced by America Ferrera that just premiered at Sundance.</p>
<p>Ana's reel: </p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/199933318?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>At this stage, we’ve already done a ton of preliminary work on the series, from writing the scripts to location scouting to 3D pre-viz and shots lists. Once we lock in the funding, we’ll hit the ground running. Our plan is to shoot the second week of May and have the series up online by the end of June, so you won’t have to wait long to see the finished product!</p>

<p>Combined with our own money and generous individuals like yourself, we will be able to make this series what it should be. If you’re unable to help financially at this time, consider passing this campaign along to someone you know. That could prove to be incredibly helpful too!</p>
<p>We appreciate every dollar, and that’s why we’ve created a broad range of perks for every level of contribution. Whether you’re interested in a social media shout out, a Blu-Ray, art from the series, or a signed slate, we have all kinds of fun rewards for you!</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>With filming there's always risks. There are so many variables that can cause trouble between weather, traffic issues, scheduling conflicts, equipment failures etc. that the best way to deal with these is to anticipate and plan ahead. We and our crew have encountered all of these challenges and more over the years, and are well prepared to face them.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It’s never been more important for filmmakers to create their own material, and we wouldn’t be coming to you if this wasn’t our most ambitious project to date.</p>
<p>THE APPLICANT packs the intrigue and twists of a blockbuster movie into a short series, and will be a powerful demonstration of our storytelling ability that builds off of what we did with the short film.</p>
<p>And for us, this is the beginning of an incredible journey that doesn’t stop here. In fact, we already have Season 2 all planned out. We’re excited to dive into the characters and deeply relevant themes of this series, and this first season can become the springboard to a much bigger world.</p>

They get a tour from an expert of the location and learn of it’s historical and haunted past. After hearing all the stories, they then embark on their own investigation of the premises and try to find evidence from the other side.</p><p>Whether you’re a paranormal fanatic or just really like hats this is a campaign you can get behind! Growing up in Penetang, James was always learning of hauntings and history in the area. The idea came to him over 10 years ago but is just coming to fruition now. After teaming up with The Midland Film Company and a rejected pitch by Bell FibeTV1 of another series it became apparent that the “Ghost Show” that James had thought of so many years before was ready for the world to see. Haunted Huronia was exactly what the network was looking for and gave the green light for a pilot episode. The pilot was so well received that the show was given the goahead on 8 more episodes. Thing is we have a very limited, shoestring budget and the episodes are not cheap to make. We are seeking your help to fund these 8 episodes and have added some really fun perks for your contributions. Always intrigued by the paranormal this show is a true dream project for James and the crew. Please help us continue this passion project.</p><p>His partner in hunting and in life is actor/producer Deanna Palazzo.   With over 2 decades in the acting business and a love for history, she brings the balance to the show.  </p><p>To round out the lot we have the resident skeptic director,editor and DOP Nate Lacroix to keep the camera rolling and keep us in the building ;)</p><p> </p><p>The Believer</p><p>James Dalzell is an actor, producer, improviser and rapper.

Nate’s passion for filmmaking began in high school when a Communications Technology course allowed him the opportunity to produce his own short films and music videos. He took that passion to Sheridan College in Oakville, Ontario where he studied Media Arts and later worked for Blackwalk Productions in Toronto before returning to his hometown to start a family. After a number of years working for Renegade Digital, a video production company in Barrie, Nate decided to embark on his own and created Midland Film Club. Through Midland Film Club Nate has produced hundreds of short films in and around his community, including a music video starring Noah Cappe (“Bachelorette Canada,” “Carnival Eats,” “The Good Witch”) for “Born Losers,” a song by Canadian recording artist, Matthew Good. In 2013 Nate completed an award-winning feature-length documentary titled “Start Local,” about the importance of supporting local, that has been featured in numerous film festivals and is frequently broadcast on RogersTV.</p><p>Nate continues to live in Midland and is currently pursuing numerous film projects.</p><p> </p><p>Who is Midland Film Company?</p><p>Midland Film Co. a small group of passionate filmmakers who are driven to create engaging films that resonate with their audiences.

Our story begins in 2007, when a young filmmaker, working as an editor at a corporate video production company in Barrie, decided it was time to pursue his dream of starting his own production company. He called it Kunu, a reference to a film he liked, and he began his journey. Slowly but surely he started becoming more known throughout the community. By 2012 he had begun connecting with others in the community who wanted to be involved in films and filmmaking. That’s when Kunu rebranded as Midland Film Club. The idea was to bring people together who wanted to create films, and support each other in creating them. To make films in our community, about our community, and celebrating our community. The culmination of which came in 2015 with the release of the feature length documentary, “Start Local.” The film gave us a deeper look at our community, showing what it means to be “local.” For the company, it was the catalyst for the final name change to Midland Film Company Inc., and a fresh look at what the company was all about.

They get a tour from an expert of the location and learn of it’s historical and haunted past. After hearing all the stories, they then embark on their own investigation of the premises and try to find evidence from the other side.Whether you’re a paranormal fanatic or just really like hats this is a campaign you can get behind! Growing up in Penetang, James was always learning of hauntings and history in the area. The idea came to him over 10 years ago but is just coming to fruition now. After teaming up with The Midland Film Company and a rejected pitch by Bell FibeTV1 of another series it became apparent that the “Ghost Show” that James had thought of so many years before was ready for the world to see. Haunted Huronia was exactly what the network was looking for and gave the green light for a pilot episode. The pilot was so well received that the show was given the goahead on 8 more episodes. Thing is we have a very limited, shoestring budget and the episodes are not cheap to make. We are seeking your help to fund these 8 episodes and have added some really fun perks for your contributions. Always intrigued by the paranormal this show is a true dream project for James and the crew. Please help us continue this passion project.His partner in hunting and in life is actor/producer Deanna Palazzo.   With over 2 decades in the acting business and a love for history, she brings the balance to the show.  To round out the lot we have the resident skeptic director,editor and DOP Nate Lacroix to keep the camera rolling and keep us in the building ;) The BelieverJames Dalzell is an actor, producer, improviser and rapper.

<h3>Our Pilot Landed to Applause</h3>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/bGQDmDfzfQA?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div><br/><strong>Check out our pilot episode right here!</strong><p></p>
<p><i> ""I certainly expect a lot of funny and interesting stories to come out of this funny little series as it continues.​"" - <a href=""http://hnmag.ca/review/coming-distractions-review/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Hollywood North Magazine</strong></a></i></p>
<div>We self-funded a 30-minute pilot as proof of concept for the show. It's a pilot that won awards for the cast and crew, at various festivals around North America. We used that pilot to market the show to networks, streaming video-on-demand sites, and even some individual production partners and a TV station. But these groups wanted to see more than our pilot, pitch documents, and a series bible with future script outlines. </div>
</div><div>
<p>So, as a team, we realized: ""We're visual artists, if those interested parties want more, let's <i>show</i> them with a web series."" </p>
<ul>
<li>With a web series, we can not only better market our show, but continue to build a further audience base for the full 30-minute series.</li>
<li>A web series can be produced easily, especially as the sets, crew and cast already exist.</li>
<li>And have you seen our cast? Read about them below.</li>
<li>We're ready to do this, and we will. Everything's set to go - all that's missing is your support.</li>
<li>Our producers have created shows before, on budget and to streaming services, so have a full sense of where and how to place a web series. Really, read on.</li>

</div><div>
<h3>The Game Plan</h3>
<p>We are in the process of producing 10 new, ten-minute episodes to follow up on the pilot, which itself will be split into two parts to provide for a 12 episode series.<br/><br/>Our budget for the pilot was $30,000, fully paid by the production company; our additional episodes will be produced for a budget of $175,000 (CDN).  The financing will come through a combination of production company investment, private third-party investment, tax credits, potential funding through the Independent Production Fund, and from people like you through this campaign.</p>
<p>Production will take place over 20 shooting days during June 2018 in Oakville, Ontario, Canada, predominantly at Film.Ca Cinemas, and at a number of other locations in the immediate area.</p>
<p>And, we realize that audiences don’t just show up on the first day, so funds are budgeted for paid social media advertising to target our core audience. This will include short videos, gifs, Instagram-stickers and photos from the show.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519938643/pvwdk7v5xxmv0r5cxbvu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Additionally, we have social media accounts for our fictional entities <a href=""https://twitter.com/cinema6cinemas"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cinema Six</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/megafilmplex?lang=en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">MegaFilmPlex</a> on Twitter, as well as Facebook Business Pages.  Using these accounts and websites, we will create a narrative outside of the show itself to build their identities and generate consumer curiosity. MegaFilmPlex will market their superior corporate promotions, while Cinema Six will brand themselves as the better choice with plucky humor. Using new graphics and some video captured during filming, social media will grow the personalities of the theatres, as they constantly snipe back and forth - before, during, and after release of the series.</p>
<h3>The Long Game</h3>
<p>Producing the show is just one component of the process of developing a successful show. Finding an audience and the right platform from which to exhibit it is just as critical.  By producing a pilot, we already understand our audience, and confirm that there is a genuine interest in the show.  We took an unusual route to publicly release our pilot on several platforms including <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/comingdistractions"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">YouTube</a>, Facebook &amp; <a href=""http://a.co/f16auiG"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Amazon Prime</a>, and amassed almost 50,000 views we have used to understand both our target audience, and what exhibition platforms are best for us.</p>
<p>The good news is that we already have a home for our series, Amazon Prime and Vimeo Video on Demand are ready to go when we are.  Both these platforms provide a revenue stream we can use to seed a second season.  In addition, we have an ongoing relationship with two major distributors/aggregators - Juice International and Film Hub - and through these companies we will be able to secure additional monetized platforms such as iTunes, Hoopla, Overdrive and  more.</p>
<p><a href=""http://a.co/f16auiG"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519928196/ro4fvge0ulsewzxsklj0.jpg"" src=""""/></a>      <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519934144/oevzoeh4idqgxc9vxkjd.jpg"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519934170/f4xvcmt6h02naqz54sgb.png"" src=""""/>         <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519934188/xedrdcrhkp8fy8hrgypn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We also have a unique angle on building an audience. Operators of independent cinemas are a tight-knit group of business people who share common issues and stories, as well as a common enemy in multiplex cinemas. We will be reaching out to these cinemas to leverage their audiences for our show through cross-promotions, screenings of our episodes before their feature presentations (like the serials of a bygone era), mailings and/or social media interactions to their audience base. This partnership will drive audiences to online platforms to watch the series, and interact with the online personalities of Cinema Six and MegaFilmPlex.</p>

</div></div>","Our Pilot Landed to Applause
Check out our pilot episode right here!
 ""I certainly expect a lot of funny and interesting stories to come out of this funny little series as it continues.​"" - Hollywood North Magazine
We self-funded a 30-minute pilot as proof of concept for the show. It's a pilot that won awards for the cast and crew, at various festivals around North America. We used that pilot to market the show to networks, streaming video-on-demand sites, and even some individual production partners and a TV station. But these groups wanted to see more than our pilot, pitch documents, and a series bible with future script outlines. 

So, as a team, we realized: ""We're visual artists, if those interested parties want more, let's show them with a web series."" 

With a web series, we can not only better market our show, but continue to build a further audience base for the full 30-minute series.
A web series can be produced easily, especially as the sets, crew and cast already exist.
And have you seen our cast? Read about them below.
We're ready to do this, and we will. Everything's set to go - all that's missing is your support.
Our producers have created shows before, on budget and to streaming services, so have a full sense of where and how to place a web series. Really, read on.



We've Done Series Television Before, We've Had Success
Our production team has produced such shows asKid's Town2nd Generation.


The Game Plan
We are in the process of producing 10 new, ten-minute episodes to follow up on the pilot, which itself will be split into two parts to provide for a 12 episode series.Our budget for the pilot was $30,000, fully paid by the production company; our additional episodes will be produced for a budget of $175,000 (CDN).  The financing will come through a combination of production company investment, private third-party investment, tax credits, potential funding through the Independent Production Fund, and from people like you through this campaign.
Production will take place over 20 shooting days during June 2018 in Oakville, Ontario, Canada, predominantly at Film.Ca Cinemas, and at a number of other locations in the immediate area.
And, we realize that audiences don’t just show up on the first day, so funds are budgeted for paid social media advertising to target our core audience. This will include short videos, gifs, Instagram-stickers and photos from the show.


Additionally, we have social media accounts for our fictional entities Cinema Six and MegaFilmPlex on Twitter, as well as Facebook Business Pages.  Using these accounts and websites, we will create a narrative outside of the show itself to build their identities and generate consumer curiosity. MegaFilmPlex will market their superior corporate promotions, while Cinema Six will brand themselves as the better choice with plucky humor. Using new graphics and some video captured during filming, social media will grow the personalities of the theatres, as they constantly snipe back and forth - before, during, and after release of the series.
The Long Game
Producing the show is just one component of the process of developing a successful show. Finding an audience and the right platform from which to exhibit it is just as critical.  By producing a pilot, we already understand our audience, and confirm that there is a genuine interest in the show.  We took an unusual route to publicly release our pilot on several platforms including YouTube, Facebook & Amazon Prime, and amassed almost 50,000 views we have used to understand both our target audience, and what exhibition platforms are best for us.
The good news is that we already have a home for our series, Amazon Prime and Vimeo Video on Demand are ready to go when we are.  Both these platforms provide a revenue stream we can use to seed a second season.  In addition, we have an ongoing relationship with two major distributors/aggregators - Juice International and Film Hub - and through these companies we will be able to secure additional monetized platforms such as iTunes, Hoopla, Overdrive and  more.
               
We also have a unique angle on building an audience. Operators of independent cinemas are a tight-knit group of business people who share common issues and stories, as well as a common enemy in multiplex cinemas. We will be reaching out to these cinemas to leverage their audiences for our show through cross-promotions, screenings of our episodes before their feature presentations (like the serials of a bygone era), mailings and/or social media interactions to their audience base. This partnership will drive audiences to online platforms to watch the series, and interact with the online personalities of Cinema Six and MegaFilmPlex.
Support the Theatre, From Your Couch
Hey, not everyone has the money for cool perks right away, but you can still help:

Share our pilot video with your friends.
Boost our project on social media.
Send our Indiegogo link to people who might be able to help.
Promote artisanally-crafted television projects (we were told it was hip to call ourselves that). 

Share and mention this project across your social media platforms and, as we see your impact, we'll send a little something your way, too.

<h2>Who We Are</h2>
<p><i>Elephant Dept.</i> is an online sketch comedy channel that develops and distributes original short form content across YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and Funny or Die. Established as a vehicle for the enhancement of the ensemble's careers, we currently feature a cast and crew of twenty that takes content from concept to completion in seven days for distribution across our media platforms. We started posting on January 8th, 2018 and, as of March 30th, our content has been viewed over 64,000 times across our platforms. In our first season, we have released sixty-three sketches (as of 03/30) and are on pace to reach our goal of one hundred by the end of USC's Spring Semester. We are currently operating with no budget and receiving no outside support.</p>

<p>Comprised mostly of BFA Actors and BA Theater majors in their senior year, our writers meet once a week to pitch new sketch ideas and workshop existing scripts.

<h2>Production</h2>
<p>Pre-production for Season Two will begin on April 30th and will include a workshop phase, a live show, and a week for test footage. Production will occur between June and September on a weekly basis with a seven day hiatus at the end of July. We will release three pieces of content every week: two sketches and one episodic segment. All of our content will be prioritized for YouTube and will be between two to five minutes in length.

<h3>Meet the Creators: </h3>
<p>Husband and wife duo, Fred Evans and Jana` Chantel, created the script for Fault:Gamma two years ago. They first became inspired by the Fukushima nuclear meltdown. Along with that idea, they entered a script writing contest that wanted to focus on diversity with women in strong technology backgrounds. Thus creating Fault: Gamma.  </p>
<p>This project is very important because it not only shows diverse, strong women, but it also educates the way technology is used in everyday life. With the continues growth of technology and the lack of visual entertainment, we want to educate how technology can be utilize on a deeper level. So we wrote this show in the hopes of breaking down advanced technology in a way that everyone can understand.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To fully fund this project we will need $20,000. The money will go towards paying our cast and crew, equipment, VFX (visual effects), props, food, and more.</p>
<p>The pie chart below shows how much of the funds will go to certain areas.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525035470/rymprnc4rmeqipihd9za.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>The Perks</h3>
<p>Your donations will not go unnoticed! We have some great perks for those who donate. Our perks includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Social Media Shout Out.</li>
<li>Special Thank You Credit.</li>
<li>Custom T-shirt.</li>
<li>A Signed Poster and Script.</li>
<li>A Day on Set.</li>
<li>A Role as an Extra.</li>
<li>Exclusive Digital Content.</li>
<li>Digital Soundtrack</li>
<li>Concept Art and Storyboards</li>
<li>Invite to Private Viewing.</li>
<li>Executive Producer Credit.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Fault Gamma adds value to the education of technology. Whether it it is used as a tool, or weapon, the purpose is to teach you how technology can be used/manipulated, therefore you can keep that resource to help you in everyday life, or prevent an attack from the reality of hackers. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Some of the risk involved includes the lack of adequate props and equipment. Without the funds, we impose the challenge of not having the right polish for the film. Whether it’s affording the right lenses,  treatment for acoustics, or props for set designing and green-screen. These lack of items make our job tougher in post, and could lead to re-shoots, or ADR (automated dialog replacement) for voice-overs.</p>
<p>Although we are experienced with getting the best quality with no-to-little budget, being properly funded will help us avoid these obstacles</p>

</div><p>And that's all there is to it.</p></div>","Meet the Creators: 
Husband and wife duo, Fred Evans and Jana` Chantel, created the script for Fault:Gamma two years ago. They first became inspired by the Fukushima nuclear meltdown. Along with that idea, they entered a script writing contest that wanted to focus on diversity with women in strong technology backgrounds. Thus creating Fault: Gamma.  
This project is very important because it not only shows diverse, strong women, but it also educates the way technology is used in everyday life. With the continues growth of technology and the lack of visual entertainment, we want to educate how technology can be utilize on a deeper level. So we wrote this show in the hopes of breaking down advanced technology in a way that everyone can understand.

What We Need & What You Get
To fully fund this project we will need $20,000. The money will go towards paying our cast and crew, equipment, VFX (visual effects), props, food, and more.
The pie chart below shows how much of the funds will go to certain areas.

The Perks
Your donations will not go unnoticed! We have some great perks for those who donate. Our perks includes:

Social Media Shout Out.
Special Thank You Credit.
Custom T-shirt.
A Signed Poster and Script.
A Day on Set.
A Role as an Extra.
Exclusive Digital Content.
Digital Soundtrack
Concept Art and Storyboards
Invite to Private Viewing.
Executive Producer Credit.


The Impact
Fault Gamma adds value to the education of technology. Whether it it is used as a tool, or weapon, the purpose is to teach you how technology can be used/manipulated, therefore you can keep that resource to help you in everyday life, or prevent an attack from the reality of hackers. 

Risks & Challenges
Some of the risk involved includes the lack of adequate props and equipment. Without the funds, we impose the challenge of not having the right polish for the film. Whether it’s affording the right lenses,  treatment for acoustics, or props for set designing and green-screen. These lack of items make our job tougher in post, and could lead to re-shoots, or ADR (automated dialog replacement) for voice-overs.
Although we are experienced with getting the best quality with no-to-little budget, being properly funded will help us avoid these obstacles

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p><strong><i>IFÉ means love in Yoruba. </i></strong>IFÉ is a short animated series that centers around stories on love and life’s journey told from the perspective of African elders. I care about this community because as a Nigerian, I have seen that our stories are often told by others who have a limited understanding of our true experiences. Using animation I am telling the stories of African immigrants whose journey apart and together came with challenges, joy, and growth. This project explores themes like marriage roles, commitment, and cultural identity while fusing it with animation music and motion.</p>

<h3>About ""My Dad, Vernon""</h3>
<p>Most dads work a normal 9-5 job, coach your soccer team, and maybe they golf in their free time. Not my dad. He lives in his car. By choice. When I first found out my dad would be living out of his car I had a lot of questions and concerns, naturally. So I decided to join him on the road for 10 days on a cross country road trip from NYC to Denver to try to understand how, and why he does this. My dad, the former military man, republican, even gun owner, was suddenly sleeping in the back of his car, meditating, and practicing reiki. He rid himself of his belongings, moved out of his nice studio in Denver and hit the road indefinitely 10 months ago. While on the road he showed me the quirky lifehacks he has created, and along the way I also learned about the moments from his past that I believe have led to this lifestyle. Join my dad and I on the road in this web series to find out how and why he lives in his car. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am aiming to raise $2,500. </p>
<p>With the money I am able to raise I will use that towards editing, reshoots, animation, and marketing, all of which are vital in order to finish the series.</p>
<p>There are different prizes for different levels of donations, including producer credits and a one of a kind ""Sleep in Your Car Kit"".</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is a story that needs to be told, and I need to tell it. It's my story, my dad's story, my families story. In many ways it's relatable to people from all walks of life; Americans who suffered great loss after the recession, the wave of people opting out of buying homes and working 9-5's to live in their vans, and pretty much anybody who at one time or another has felt the urge to leave everything behind and hit the road.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are unable to contribute financially, another great way to support me and this project is by sharing! Getting the word out is an amazing way to help the series grow. Share this Indiegogo page, share the facebook page, the instagram, and tell your family and friends about it.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Since we started one year ago, <strong>Saving Ghosts</strong> has been on a mission to help lost spirits cross over and be different from the <strong><i>other</i></strong> paranormal researchers. With our growing community and support, <strong>we have been able to accomplish so much...</strong></p>
<p><strong>But now we need to improve and up our game.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here's a breakdown of what we need to happen:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>$500 goal to improve some of our equipment.</strong></li>

<li><strong>$4,000 goal to improve equipment <i>and</i> go to NEW ORLEANS for featured shoots!</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, you will get a variety of personalized gifts from private sessions, to meet and greets (if applicable), and so many other things!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We have been in this game for a while, I myself have been in the paranormal for over 20 years. The importance of what we do is massive for these reason:</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Doing a web series, like a film or anything else costs money… that goes without saying, but I did it anyway. =)   I've done short films and have won many awards and accolades, so now my newest challenge... a comedy web series! Why? Cuz who doesn’t need to laugh in today’s climate and let's just sprinkle in some social commentary because who doesn’t need to shake and nod their heads with a smile once in a while. (Non-Political)</p>
<p>I will have some actors you may have seen before on your favorite shows, but this is also about showcasing talented cast and crew yet to be fully discovered.  Having the audience falling in love and hate with the characters they portray is what makes writing and acting worthwhile… so, I need help financing this project to feed these wonderful people and for post-production, marketing, promotions, film festivals, etc.  </p>
<p>The Story is a fun look at one man’s journey through Hollywood with his friends as they age and realize adaptation is the key to surviving in this industry.  Life can get in the way some times, but it makes things more interesting in the quest to doing what you love.    </p>
<p>A diverse cast of characters enhance the story and I hope you will join us on our 14 episode journey… because it’s just the tip with season one.  =)</p>
<p>Much love and thank you for your support!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Breaking it down...</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply put... we need $5,000.00 to finish our web series and for Post Production, Marketing, Promotional Merch, Hot meals, Crafty and other miscellaneous expenses that arise during Production and Post-Production.</li>
<li>This is a fundraising effort first and foremost, but we have some unique perks only found during this campaign as a thank you from the bottom of our indie filmmaker hearts for getting in on the ground floor! First Season!</li>
<li>All contributions will be used immediately, as our target date to finish production is January, 2019. I've always finished a project and this one is my biggest endeavor yet... 14 episodes = 85 pages. Pre-production is done... now it's time to make this baby a reality!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Donating to our campaign is the only way we finish our project and you make all the difference with your contribution:</p>
<ul>
<li>This project is valuable in that indie filmmaking is where unique stories are told. The best programs are original... and that's what this comedy is... from writing to cast to crew.</li>
<li>As a writer, director, actor, producer, I've had a successful track record with projects like my short films Ingles and Missed Call. Winning Awards and Accolades that have lead to Industry professionals looking forward to seeing my versatility and excited about what's next on my plate. This is it.</li>
<li>I've acted in commercials, film and Television Programs. I helped my son become a professional acting star and managed him successfully through contract negotiations, meaningful roles and made it fun for him by balancing his acting childhood with sports and other leisure activities to provide a balanced upbringing... a happy determined child, now teen. My success as a filmmaker for independent projects has helped people other than myself... and I find extreme satisfaction in that. Hearing people laugh or react to a scene is what drives me. I love to entertain... in all aspects of filmmaking... but it takes more than one person to make it happen. Everyone who puts time, effort and/or money into one of my projects... are the do'ers I love to be around and hope to share in the success with.</li>
<li>With Indie go-go site... they take 5% of all contributions and another 3% + .30 cents for credit card use. So, reaching our goal is actually a higher amount than what we're asking for, but every donation does takes us a step closer to finishing our project, so we'll focus on the positive... just being completely transparent. Thank you.</li>
</ul>
</div><div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div><div>
<p>All contributions matter, whether small or choosing a perk. It all counts! I understand that though some people really want to, they just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can get the word out and make some noise about your campaign. </li>
<li>Share our campaign link and direct people on social media and word of mouth!</li>

<strong>Synopsis</strong>:</h3><p>In pursuit of one day becoming the next great TV Show Host Comedian, Jessi takes the plunge and meets the City of Angels, and boy does it take her on a whirlwind. After multiple enjoyably awkward mishaps, Jessi must navigate through her insecurities, naivety and unfit tendencies as she finds herself on a road not only to self discovery but self recovery, because let’s face it - LA is not kind to the artistic mind.</p><p><strong>Take a look at a few clips of Jessi being .... well, herself...</strong></p><div>

</div><h3 style=""color:#cd397f;"">
<strong>About the Show and our Hopes</strong>:</h3><p>Jessi Who, yes that is her last name. Simple chick whose goal is to one day become a TV show host as big as Ellen Degeneres and make a difference in people’s lives by being funny, witty and of course, adored. She moves to LA where she believes she has to tackle literally every aspect of the entertainment business to get there, don’t we all? She sees her best friend, Aelys, get discovered almost instantly and land a recurring role on a Netflix Original Series. Jessi falls in the LA trap of having to “look” like everyone, cute, petite, Kardashian, - there’s only one problem, she is none of that. Jessi is tall, awkward, (I mean for fuck sake, even her name is spelled in an awkward way) she has dreads that constantly get her into debates, compares herself to her cutesy bestfriend who seems to have it all and yet she’s naive enough to believe that she DOES fit in. But that’s just it, she does fit in because she quickly realizes that LA is no glamour shot, it isn’t a place where you walk into a bar, all heads turn and you get discovered to be the next Angelina Jolie.</p><p>No - here we follow Jessi through the nitty gritty of LA living reality, being broke, finding side hustles to make ends meet, living in a studio, going to auditions left and right, looking for love and the most famous - trying to discover and find herself. Here’s the fun part - it’s done in such a relatable way, because believe it or not - We all go through it. This show is to bring laughter in the simplest of mishaps that seem bigger when we are the ones going through it. Jessi Who will take us on Jessi’s journey of self discovery and make us laugh throughout. My hopes for this show are simple, ready? Here it goes - Just, enjoy it! By the end, I hope the audience feels understood and a little better. Because hey, sometimes simplicity feels so complicated.</p><h3 style=""color:#cd397f;""><strong>You'll get BEEP - BOOPS AND EPISODES</strong></h3><p><strong>What does that mean exactly?</strong></p><p>Jessi Who?

<p>The idea to create “Jessi Who?” Started about 5 years ago.

Synopsis:In pursuit of one day becoming the next great TV Show Host Comedian, Jessi takes the plunge and meets the City of Angels, and boy does it take her on a whirlwind. After multiple enjoyably awkward mishaps, Jessi must navigate through her insecurities, naivety and unfit tendencies as she finds herself on a road not only to self discovery but self recovery, because let’s face it - LA is not kind to the artistic mind.Take a look at a few clips of Jessi being .... well, herself...
  

About the Show and our Hopes:Jessi Who, yes that is her last name. Simple chick whose goal is to one day become a TV show host as big as Ellen Degeneres and make a difference in people’s lives by being funny, witty and of course, adored. She moves to LA where she believes she has to tackle literally every aspect of the entertainment business to get there, don’t we all? She sees her best friend, Aelys, get discovered almost instantly and land a recurring role on a Netflix Original Series. Jessi falls in the LA trap of having to “look” like everyone, cute, petite, Kardashian, - there’s only one problem, she is none of that. Jessi is tall, awkward, (I mean for fuck sake, even her name is spelled in an awkward way) she has dreads that constantly get her into debates, compares herself to her cutesy bestfriend who seems to have it all and yet she’s naive enough to believe that she DOES fit in. But that’s just it, she does fit in because she quickly realizes that LA is no glamour shot, it isn’t a place where you walk into a bar, all heads turn and you get discovered to be the next Angelina Jolie.No - here we follow Jessi through the nitty gritty of LA living reality, being broke, finding side hustles to make ends meet, living in a studio, going to auditions left and right, looking for love and the most famous - trying to discover and find herself. Here’s the fun part - it’s done in such a relatable way, because believe it or not - We all go through it. This show is to bring laughter in the simplest of mishaps that seem bigger when we are the ones going through it. Jessi Who will take us on Jessi’s journey of self discovery and make us laugh throughout. My hopes for this show are simple, ready? Here it goes - Just, enjoy it! By the end, I hope the audience feels understood and a little better. Because hey, sometimes simplicity feels so complicated.You'll get BEEP - BOOPS AND EPISODESWhat does that mean exactly?Jessi Who? Beep - Boops are short sketches that will appear before the episodes air. Each one will mention hints to later episodes, once the episodes drop - we will have little contests for our viewers, if they can connect the dots of which episodes were hinted in what specific BEEP - BOOP, they will win a prize.

<h3>It You Plant It, It Will Grow</h3>
<p>When I first came up with the idea for this show in late 2015, I decided I wanted to ""change the world through food."" I had recently gone vegan at the time and noticed that there weren't any TV shows focusing on a plant-based and vegan lifestyle. At least, not in the form of a TV series. So, I developed the show concept and was lucky enough to find a great team to produce the show, and pitched it to some major networks.</p>
<p>In the vegan community, I was called a ""trailblazer"" because essentially, this hadn't been done before. Veganism had yet to go mainstream. That is, until my show debuted in July of 2016 on A&amp;E's FYI channel across America to 70 million households!</p>
<h3>Why This Show Is So Important</h3>
<p>Many people still think that a vegan lacks nutrients and energy, but my show demonstrates that the opposite is true. It show us that we can get all the nutrients we need without eating animal products, and are physically and mentally stronger.  Moreover, by being vegan, we are helping to protect the future of our environment. In fact, a global shift towards a vegan or plant-based diet is vital to save the world from hunger, fuel poverty, and the worst impacts of climate change. A reduction in the demand for meat will mean less cruelty associated with the treatment of animals bred for the meat industry. </p>
<p>On Plant-Based By Nafsika, we talk food, fashion, beauty, health and innovations. So you learn a little AND have fun doing it!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>So Here's What I'm Asking</h3>
<p>Although it was an amazing experience to work on this project last year, I essentially had to fund the first season myself. :(  And it was hard. Even though I was shown some love in the community, I was not getting the financial support I needed. Now, we are working on Season 2 and I am asking for your help. </p>
<p>The money I hope to raise here will go directly to paying the production costs. But it's a win-win! Because I've put together some exciting perks for you to choose from.</p>
<p>I've planted the seed, but need your support so that I could keep it growing. If I surpass my goal, I will then start working on bringing my show to more networks globally.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>MISMANAGED is the story of Charlie, who finds himself the manager of the overnight shift at a theater when his parents spend his college fund on what they call a ""lifetime cruise."" It's not great timing for them to both have a mid-life crisis, and it leaves Charlie in a much different place than he thought he would be. He's left to his own devices, trying to figure out what to do with life, love, and leadership of a group of certifiably strange people. </p>

<p>My name is Garrett Ray, and I wrote MISMANAGED. I spent the last 9 years of my life dedicating myself to acting, stand up comedy, writing, and in the last three years I've tackled every aspect of filmmaking that I could get my hands on. Previously, me and my team shot 5 short films in 3 months, premiering them at events in Texas and Oklahoma to raise money for The Chosen Tree (a non-profit organization that fights human trafficking in America).</p>
<p>About two years ago, I started to think about a job I had spent some time at before I graduated high school: working at a movie theater. It was only 9 months of my life, but in that time I was starting to transition into adulthood. Starting my own production company, Solar Flight Productions, I catapulted myself forward and left the theater where I was feeling stuck in my ""real job.""</p>
<p>After leaving I started to wonder, ""What if I hadn't left? What would life be like?"" That's how MISMANAGED was born. Over the next 13 months, I wrote, rewrote, fantasized, planned, plotted, and slowly started to ask people about their interest in the project. My crew, who has worked with me on multiple short films, all loved the idea. Their reaction was overwhelming! As soon as I knew I was onto something that was as good as I hoped it to be, I began to work in earnest.</p>
<p>This project is my way of trying to reach out and show young adults that life is crazy, yes, but there's purpose in it. It's also a push to get more clean comedy out into the wild and show that we can be funny without being vulgar. It's a passion shared by everyone on our team.</p>
<p><font><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Your support helps us pursue that goal, but it does so much </span>more<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> than that. MISMANAGED is going to be shot with the help of local high school students who have a passion for film making. <strong>We're getting a group of students on board to have credited work for when they enter the work field after high school, and learn invaluable skills along the way.</strong> We're </span>trying<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> to give back to our community by training up those who are following in our footsteps.</span></font></p>

<h3>Campaign Goals</h3>
<p>Our goal for this campaign is $2,500. We need to raise this money to take care of the basic necessities on set:</p>
<ul>
<li>Food for a large cast and crew over (5) five 12-hour-days of filming</li>
<li>Basic costuming (vests, pants, for theater uniforms and ""Buzzer Hockey"" gear, as well as some studded boots for Grand Avenue's resident cynic Farrah)</li>
<li>Stunt safety gear for throwing someone over the hood of a car</li>
<li>Coffee. All of our shoots are overnights, and we need people awake!</li>
<li>Props (which includes a real duck or a very convincing fake one)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Perks: Yeah, We've Got 'Em. You Could Too!</h3>
<p>When you back our campaign, you get cool stuff, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get your name in the credits!</li>
<li>See episodes early!</li>
<li>Have an executive producer credit in the opening title of the show!</li>
<li>Get a page from our scripts, signed by the cast!</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is just the start for MISMANAGED. Your contribution goes toward starting something truly special. We aim to make this show a regular thing, releasing full seasons down the road.

MISMANAGED is the story of Charlie, who finds himself the manager of the overnight shift at a theater when his parents spend his college fund on what they call a ""lifetime cruise."" It's not great timing for them to both have a mid-life crisis, and it leaves Charlie in a much different place than he thought he would be. He's left to his own devices, trying to figure out what to do with life, love, and leadership of a group of certifiably strange people. 

My name is Garrett Ray, and I wrote MISMANAGED. I spent the last 9 years of my life dedicating myself to acting, stand up comedy, writing, and in the last three years I've tackled every aspect of filmmaking that I could get my hands on. Previously, me and my team shot 5 short films in 3 months, premiering them at events in Texas and Oklahoma to raise money for The Chosen Tree (a non-profit organization that fights human trafficking in America).
About two years ago, I started to think about a job I had spent some time at before I graduated high school: working at a movie theater. It was only 9 months of my life, but in that time I was starting to transition into adulthood. Starting my own production company, Solar Flight Productions, I catapulted myself forward and left the theater where I was feeling stuck in my ""real job.""
After leaving I started to wonder, ""What if I hadn't left? What would life be like?"" That's how MISMANAGED was born.

My crew, who has worked with me on multiple short films, all loved the idea. Their reaction was overwhelming! As soon as I knew I was onto something that was as good as I hoped it to be, I began to work in earnest.
This project is my way of trying to reach out and show young adults that life is crazy, yes, but there's purpose in it. It's also a push to get more clean comedy out into the wild and show that we can be funny without being vulgar. It's a passion shared by everyone on our team.
Your support helps us pursue that goal, but it does so much more than that. MISMANAGED is going to be shot with the help of local high school students who have a passion for film making. We're getting a group of students on board to have credited work for when they enter the work field after high school, and learn invaluable skills along the way. We're trying to give back to our community by training up those who are following in our footsteps.

<h3>Who Are We?</h3>
<p>Over the last 6 1/2 years, we've produced podcasts about JavaScript, Ruby, Angular, iOS, React Native, and Freelancing. It started with Ruby Rogues in 2011 and expanded to JavaScript Jabber and the Freelancers' Show in 2012.</p>
<p>Since then, we've added other shows and a new format where we talk to developers and past guests from the shows about what they're doing now and how they got into programming in the first place.</p>
<p>Our mission is to help software developers build better careers, relationships, lives, and skills. Many of our listeners have asked for a podcast about React similar to the other shows we provide.</p>
<p>Because we want to help you grow, we are putting together this podcast about React.</p>
<p>We typically support podcasts through sponsorship. As we ramp up, we'd love to have your support in putting the show together. </p>
<p>We anticipate that a large number of our current listeners will cross over from JavaScript and Ruby into React.</p>
<p>Overall, though, we have a lot of ideas for upcoming shows and feel like this is a great way to figure out if people want the show enough to support it. And, if there's enough support to pay for the show's production for 6 months, we can produce it and line up sponsorships to continue it long-term.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're looking to gather enough funding to cover the production for about 30 shows. That's a little more than 6 months of shows.</p>
<p>The production and hosting costs around $100 per episode. So, the overall number we'd reach ideally is $3000 plus $500 to pay for the artwork and designs for the podcast.</p>
<p>This does not cover the time Charles and team spend finding guests, scheduling guests, supporting hosts, and working on the Devchat.tv website. We'll take care of it, though, and hopefully find sponsors to fund this relatively quickly.</p>
<p>We currently have interest from a few of our existing hosts in co-hosting this show. We're also working on putting together t-shirts, mugs, stickers, and other goodies to hand out. </p>
<p>We'll also invite you to the Devchat.tv supporters' Slack room where we discuss the shows, technology, and careers with each other.</p>
<p>On the off-chance that we don't reach our goal, we'll pull together some of the top folks in React and up our game for React Dev Summit Feb 26-Mar 2.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is a terrific opportunity to help us create an awesome resource that will help people in the React and web development communities for years to come. Over the years, we've helped several people start and grow in their careers in programming with our advice, knowledge, and explanations by our hosts and guests on how to best apply the things they do best.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Most of Charles' focus over the last year has been on general JavaScript and the Angular community.</p>
<p>However, he's reached out to several people in the React community and has gotten some quality referrals for both hosts and guests.</p>
<p>We also find that most people are open to appearing on a podcast and we feel that we can grow our network of React developers to include many folks who are solving interesting and difficult problems across the community.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute monetarily, we understand. Everyone's situation is different. We still welcome suggestions for topics and guests. Send your email to help@devchat.tv with suggestions under the subject line ""React podcast suggestions"" and we'll keep track of those.</p>

But first...Cara Brennan and Jack Payne are co-writers and creators of Asher,  with Cara starring and Jack directing. After collaborating on several passion projects together, they decided it was time to make something a little bigger; something that would allow them to tell the story most important to both of them: The Hero’s Story - the fight of good versus evil.Both creators are passionate about creating art that reflects the individual’s struggle to live with love and faith in a scary and chaotic world.  They believe that discovering the power of the Inner Hero is a liberating imperative for every human being.Cara hails from the Washington, DC area, and Jack from K.C., Missouri. They met at college in NYC in 2007, and have been friends since.To create an original six episode series (episodes each running 20-23 minutes) that will be available to anyone, anywhere.To submit the series to festivals for wider exposure.To use Asher as the flagship of Lonely Cow Productions that enables us to continue to make original content for a global audience.Pre-production for Asher lasted two months, during which time we wrote first drafts for the entire first season, and an outline for season 2.  We assembled a cast, crew, and equipment, while securing filming locations.Filming of the pilot episode went efficiently, lasting full 5 days in total.Post-production took about a month, with Jack taking on the bulk of editing responsibilities, such as picture lock, color correction, sound design, scoring, and special effects. Cara oversaw the editing process while developing the Indiegogo page, promotional materials, and organizing the live NYC premiere.Asher was filmed on the Sony A6500 with a portrait and wide angle lens.Lighting was done on two Yongnuo soft lights and lights that were available on location.Sound was done on the Rode VideoMic Pro attached to the A6500.Editing was completed on a 2011 Mac with Final Cut Pro X.Because you want to see a thrilling detective story with ol’ fashioned gothic horror.Because you like to see strong bad-ass women on TV.Because you like to see heroes who are relatable and imperfect but still try their hardest.Because real life is messy and sometimes our stories need to echo that.Because you believe that art reflects and explores essential truths necessary for a healthy society.To pay our actors, our crew, music usage, location rental, equipment rentals, festival fees, and craft services. If we meet our ultimate goals, Jack and Cara will be able to take a little time off from their day jobs to get the series out sooner.  The pilot was fully funded by the creators while they worked full time. With a bigger budget, we will be able to get the remaining 5 episodes out in less than a few months. Taking care of our cast and crew is our top priority; it’s their dedication of energy and time that makes shows like Asher possible and they deserve to be well paid.As well as taking care of our cast and crew, we need to upgrade our tech.We need:-To acquire new lenses for the A6500 (which will give us more flexibility on set to cover a variety of visuals).-Better sound equipment, including a cord and boom pole. We also need a separate mixing unit to plug in headphones into (so we can hear what is being recorded live while filming).-Additional lights to create a more immersive mood.  -A new computer with more efficient high resolution footage processing capabilities (our current computer has trouble running 4K footage without crashing the system), and new editing software.-Gore, creature effects makeup, and practical S/FX (good quality effects will enable us to create more high concept sequences).Here is the financial breakdown to complete Asher: Between paying our cast and crew and acquiring additional upgraded technology, each episode will cost roughly 5,000. -$2,000 - Is the minimum amount we need to buy new lenses, upgrade our audio equipment, pay our core cast, and to hire one additional crew member. This will give us the basic resources to film Episode 2.-$5,000 - All of the above, plus we can secure additional filming locations, upgrade our special effects, upgrade our lighting equipment, and include a fully realized set piece action sequence (hiring a fight choreographer). We will be able to complete Episode 3.-$7,500 - All of the above,  and we can upgrade our computer and editing equipment. We will be able to hire additional cast (extras) and one more crew members, as well one additional post-production technician.  These are the optimal resources needed to film Episodes 2 & 3. -$10,000 - All of the above and the resources to additionally film all of Episode 4.-$15,000 - All of the above and the resources to additionally film all of Episode 5.-$20,000 - All of the above and the resources to additionally film all of Episode 6 (the entire series, Episodes 2-6).-$25,000 - Allows the resources to complete all filming by the end of year.INVEST by selecting a donation tier to your right.

<p>Let’s get straight to the point about what this show is about, and why we’re the people telling it. </p>
<p>John Paul Harkins and Genevieve Thompson are two NYC based Actors who, for a long time, relied on the Sharing Economy model to survive in a city which has become unaffordable for artists. In their case, it was Uber and Airbnb. We’ve now created a show about the reality of what it’s like to live that model while trying not to lose sight of our dreams, which can at times, seem beyond our reach. The show follows the lives of 3 Actors:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">- Jackie (played by <u>Genevieve Thompson</u>), who rents out the extra bedrooms in her (and sometimes other people's) apartment on Airbnb &lt;in the show, ""ShareBnB""&gt;</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">- Will (played by <u>John Paul Harkins</u>), who drives for Uber &lt;in the show, ""Ultra""&gt;</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">- Arie (played by <u>Samantha Aneson</u>), who delivers for Postmates &lt;in the show, ""Deliver-Ease""&gt;</p>
<p><strong>""ETA""</strong>, which stands for Estimated Time Arrival can be applied to a customer waiting for a pick-up, a host waiting for her guest, and a delivery waiting to be made. Most importantly, what is the ETA of our careers? Is there one?</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The reality of our Today is that JP and I are not the only ones who’ve jumped on that Sharing Economy band wagon. We hope to create a show that artists and freelancers alike relate to. For those coming from a different vantage point, we hope to provide an authentic, time-relevant, and refreshingly honest depiction of life in our shoes. </p>

<p><strong>Dating in LA is hard enough.</strong> For ALICIA, dating in LA is an even bigger struggle <strong>as she is part of one of the least desirable dating groups – black women</strong>. The few <strong>guys who are interested in her are usually white men who fetishize her blackness, or fuckboys</strong> – men who are only interested in one night stands. Despite a string of bad dating luck, <strong>Alicia refuses to give up hope.</strong> She’s determined to find the man of her dreams. <strong>Which is why she thinks her fate has finally changed when she matches with JORDAN on Tinder.</strong> In addition to being <strong>fine as hell,</strong> he’s smart, funny, and everything Alicia wants in a guy. Unfortunately, Jordan doesn’t see Alicia the same way. <strong>After their first date, Jordan “ghosts” Alicia.</strong> He stops answering Alicia’s calls, texts, and, worst of all, ignores her Facebook friend request. <strong>Not wanting to give up on love, Alicia employs every tactic in the book, from sending illicit thirst traps (the dick pic of 2017) through Snapchat,</strong> to liking several of Jordan’s photos on Instagram. Alicia’s best friend, MALLORIE (24), a traditional dating aficionado, wants Alicia to forget Jordan and jump back on the dating horse without going the route of dating apps and thirst traps. <strong>Alicia is determined to get Jordan back</strong> and have the true love she has always dreamed of, even if it means embarrassing herself along the way.</p>
<p>Over the course of ten episodes, <strong>we see Alicia go from hiring an Instagram dating coach, famous for his “Instagram Not to Instagram Thot” video series, </strong>to participating in a reality show <strong>entitled “Swipe Right on Love”,</strong> a game that brings dating apps to life, to forcing her friends to recreate their entire snap story at the club from the night before so Jordan can see how much fun she is. <strong>Most importantly, we see Alicia learn to not settle for the first guy who comes along</strong> <strong>as she meets ADRIAN, an Asian man, who, next to black women, are the least sought after demographic on dating sites.</strong></p>
<p>Want to see more? Here is a look at our first episode:</p>

<p>If dating in the social media age is the series protagonist, then race relations in dating is the pivotal character.  <strong>One of the big inspirations behind the series is that black women and Asian men are the least sought after demographic on dating sites</strong>. I strongly <strong>believe this has a lot to do with how black women and Asian men are perceived in the media.</strong> While there are shows like <i>Insecure</i> and <i>Chewing Gum</i>, those are only two voices that are speaking about the black female experience. As a black woman from the south, who grew up in a predominately white neighborhood, I can say that my experiences with dating are starkly different from the ones portrayed on these shows. Not to say that shows like <i>Insecure</i> and <i>Chewing Gum</i> do not give an accurate representation of the black female experience, but there is room for more. As the series progresses, we see Alicia confront the racial stigmas that come with dating as a black woman.</p>
<p>Another thing that makes Dating Now unique is that it <strong>does not just focus on the black woman’s perspective.</strong> Alicia’s best friend, Mallorie, and her eventual love interest, Adrian, are both Asian. The series goes into a discussion on the obstacles this demographic faces as well. <strong>The overall goal of Dating Now is to poke fun at dating, while also opening up a discussion about our prejudices and minority representation in media.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dating Now is a mix between Insecure, Man Seeking Woman and Chewing Gum, in that the show takes a surreal approach to dating and race.</strong> No one episode of the series is the same. <strong>Alicia’s journey begins with her getting advice from a mannequin on proper hand-job techniques and spirals from there.</strong> Later in the series<strong>, when Alicia meets her love interest, Adrian,</strong> we see their relationship play out in an extended <strong>Rom-Com trailer.</strong> In the final episode, when Alicia and Adrian are comfortable with their relationship, we see them deal with the stereotypes the outside world puts on a<strong> Blasian couple</strong> in a Horror, Thriller- inspired episode.</p>

</div></div>","Dating in LA is hard enough. For ALICIA, dating in LA is an even bigger struggle as she is part of one of the least desirable dating groups – black women. The few guys who are interested in her are usually white men who fetishize her blackness, or fuckboys – men who are only interested in one night stands. Despite a string of bad dating luck, Alicia refuses to give up hope. She’s determined to find the man of her dreams. Which is why she thinks her fate has finally changed when she matches with JORDAN on Tinder. In addition to being fine as hell, he’s smart, funny, and everything Alicia wants in a guy. Unfortunately, Jordan doesn’t see Alicia the same way. After their first date, Jordan “ghosts” Alicia. He stops answering Alicia’s calls, texts, and, worst of all, ignores her Facebook friend request. Not wanting to give up on love, Alicia employs every tactic in the book, from sending illicit thirst traps (the dick pic of 2017) through Snapchat, to liking several of Jordan’s photos on Instagram. Alicia’s best friend, MALLORIE (24), a traditional dating aficionado, wants Alicia to forget Jordan and jump back on the dating horse without going the route of dating apps and thirst traps. Alicia is determined to get Jordan back and have the true love she has always dreamed of, even if it means embarrassing herself along the way.
Over the course of ten episodes, we see Alicia go from hiring an Instagram dating coach, famous for his “Instagram Not to Instagram Thot” video series, to participating in a reality show entitled “Swipe Right on Love”, a game that brings dating apps to life, to forcing her friends to recreate their entire snap story at the club from the night before so Jordan can see how much fun she is. Most importantly, we see Alicia learn to not settle for the first guy who comes along as she meets ADRIAN, an Asian man, who, next to black women, are the least sought after demographic on dating sites.
Want to see more? Here is a look at our first episode:




If dating in the social media age is the series protagonist, then race relations in dating is the pivotal character.  One of the big inspirations behind the series is that black women and Asian men are the least sought after demographic on dating sites. I strongly believe this has a lot to do with how black women and Asian men are perceived in the media. While there are shows like Insecure and Chewing Gum, those are only two voices that are speaking about the black female experience. As a black woman from the south, who grew up in a predominately white neighborhood, I can say that my experiences with dating are starkly different from the ones portrayed on these shows. Not to say that shows like Insecure and Chewing Gum do not give an accurate representation of the black female experience, but there is room for more. As the series progresses, we see Alicia confront the racial stigmas that come with dating as a black woman.
Another thing that makes Dating Now unique is that it does not just focus on the black woman’s perspective. Alicia’s best friend, Mallorie, and her eventual love interest, Adrian, are both Asian. The series goes into a discussion on the obstacles this demographic faces as well. The overall goal of Dating Now is to poke fun at dating, while also opening up a discussion about our prejudices and minority representation in media.
Dating Now is a mix between Insecure, Man Seeking Woman and Chewing Gum, in that the show takes a surreal approach to dating and race. No one episode of the series is the same. Alicia’s journey begins with her getting advice from a mannequin on proper hand-job techniques and spirals from there. Later in the series, when Alicia meets her love interest, Adrian, we see their relationship play out in an extended Rom-Com trailer. In the final episode, when Alicia and Adrian are comfortable with their relationship, we see them deal with the stereotypes the outside world puts on a Blasian couple in a Horror, Thriller- inspired episode.

<h3>Why and What Is Green Garden?</h3>
<p>In 2017, 63% of Americans thought it was time to federally legalize cannabis. Those in the remaining 37% tend to belong to an older generation whose peripheral exposure to cannabis use came from exaggerated personae like Snoop Dogg, Cheech &amp; Chong, and the characters on Weeds. But there are people who need cannabis to treat real medical conditions such as epilepsy, autism, PTSD, anxiety, and cancer. Some of these patients are children.</p>
<p>Meet Aiden. Aiden has epilepsy. Aiden’s parents, Nina and Osiris, watched their child suffer <strong>200 seizures PER DAY</strong>. <strong>They decided that that was enough</strong>. Aiden became a medical cannabis patient; his seizures have <strong>dropped to 10 per month. I</strong>magine Aiden’s childhood had a silly thing like stigma not stood in the way of legitimate treatment for his condition.</p>

<p>Aiden is just <strong>one of many</strong> helped by the legalization of cannabis. How many years must those in states that still criminalize cannabis wait before progress is achieved at the federal level?</p>

<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p><strong>In 2017</strong> alone, over <strong>70,000 people died from opioid use</strong>. Cannabis, a drug with no recorded overdoses in history, is being used in certain states to wean addicts off opioids. Yet <strong>85% of the more than 643,000 people jailed from 2006 to 2010 were imprisoned for non-violent cannabis </strong>possession. Think about that. Research has shown that cannabis can shrink cancer cells but the federal government still groups cannabis with hard drugs like heroin. Furthermore, jobs created by the <strong>cannabis industry have a 445% growth rate</strong>. Many of us have heard how many billions of dollars this industry is projected to make by 2020, but these figures pale in comparison with the economic engine created if all 50 states had the freedom to regulate a recreational cannabis market.</p>
<p>For most people,<strong> the picture is clear:</strong> lives lost and dollars lost makes no sense in 2018! Green Garden will help <strong>normalize conversation, remove stigma, and change America</strong>. If your cookbook, vape pen, or studio visit aren’t gratification enough, you can sleep soundly knowing your contribution has helped build something that brings this country forward. Your backing helps hundreds of thousands of people live their lives in peace and good health. And by opening up new markets of receptive consumers, Green Garden helps your other cannabis investments flourish, too!</p>

That's this. You're here right now reading it.</p><p>I'm 22, from New Jersey, I'm an actor, writer and barista (shocking.) So, here's a little background regarding this project. I started writing the pilot episode to this project in March of 2016. It was going well, until I put it on hiatus due to the fact that I was too depressed to write, let alone leave my bed on most days. I was that depressed when I started writing it as well, but it got worse. From 2014 to January 2017, I was on and off suicidal.</p><p>However, through hard, hard work in therapy and finding the right medication for me, I haven't had a genuine suicidal thought since January. I finished writing the pilot episode a month ago from posting this, and I am excited, eager, and hungry for this to get made. This story is a super important and valuable story to share with the world and I know that it will do nothing but good.</p><p>Dust is not about me. The main message of this story is to exercise empathy, it teaches you how to get over emotional roadblocks no matter how severe they are, and it teaches how to deal with your internal demons. All with a healthy dose of dark comedic relief. You'll feel uncomfortable as fuck, you'll cry, your heart will warm, and most importantly, you'll laugh.  </p><h2>Why I'm asking for money</h2><p>Right. So. Why should you donate your hard-earned cash to lil' ol' me. Here are some reasons (holy shit I'm so bad at this):</p><p>I have a full production team of professionals and people who work in the industry working on this with me. I would like to pay them. I have my director and two other crew members flying in from LA (I live in NJ) and I would like to pay for their food and hotel. As for the others, they are taking time off from their jobs to work on this with me for 6 days.

That's this. You're here right now reading it.I'm 22, from New Jersey, I'm an actor, writer and barista (shocking.) So, here's a little background regarding this project. I started writing the pilot episode to this project in March of 2016. It was going well, until I put it on hiatus due to the fact that I was too depressed to write, let alone leave my bed on most days. I was that depressed when I started writing it as well, but it got worse. From 2014 to January 2017, I was on and off suicidal.However, through hard, hard work in therapy and finding the right medication for me, I haven't had a genuine suicidal thought since January. I finished writing the pilot episode a month ago from posting this, and I am excited, eager, and hungry for this to get made. This story is a super important and valuable story to share with the world and I know that it will do nothing but good.Dust is not about me. The main message of this story is to exercise empathy, it teaches you how to get over emotional roadblocks no matter how severe they are, and it teaches how to deal with your internal demons. All with a healthy dose of dark comedic relief. You'll feel uncomfortable as fuck, you'll cry, your heart will warm, and most importantly, you'll laugh.  Why I'm asking for moneyRight. So. Why should you donate your hard-earned cash to lil' ol' me. Here are some reasons (holy shit I'm so bad at this):I have a full production team of professionals and people who work in the industry working on this with me. I would like to pay them. I have my director and two other crew members flying in from LA (I live in NJ) and I would like to pay for their food and hotel. As for the others, they are taking time off from their jobs to work on this with me for 6 days. I would also like to compensate them, as this means way much more to me than words can express and they'd be missing out on funds from work. We are shooting after-hours at a deli for two-three days for this shoot. I know the owner would also appreciate some compensation, as they'd be running the electricity for longer than they usually do, and we will be using the equipment in the kitchen, sucking up precious electricity. Paying for miscellaneous items; such as props. I have a good graphic designer friend of mine who will be making some posters and labels for props (she doesn't know this yet, actually, but hi Jacqui xoxo) and I would like to compensate her for that as well. Promotional stills, advertisements, editing, and everything post-production will be handled by friends of mine. These donations are more-so going to everyone else besides me. Any left over funds from this campaign would go towards shooting the rest of the episodes, which I will also try to fund through Indiegogo.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><b>THE STORY</b></i><i><b> </b></i></p>
<p><u><strong>Concept:</strong></u> A rag-tag group of college dropouts struggle to prove that they can thrive in a town where college rules everything. </p>
<p><b><u>Logline</u></b>: Rhad, a college dropout and former nightclub employee trying to get back at his former boss - as well as his cheating girlfriend - convinces the employees at his new job (also dropouts) to turn their dying restaurant into a competing nightclub.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550101272/jxgc4hfbxbeb3mro27k9.png"" src=""""/><br/><br/><u><strong>Synopsis:</strong></u> After RHAD finds his girlfriend, STACEY, hooking up with their boss, RANDALL, at the Czar Nightclub, Rhad quits his job and his girlfriend. His flamboyant roommate DONNIE then scores him a job interview at THE FORTUNE COOKIE RESTAURANT-- which to Rhad's surprise, is right across from the Czar. Rhad is then hired on the spot by LARRY, the bizarre, prank-pulling boss of The Fortune Cookie. Larry puts Rhad under the care of LIZ, the general manager and general narcissist. Hilarity is taken to extremes when ARTURO, the landlord with a dress shirt that struggles to hold back his potbelly, informs LARRY that he's being evicted unless back rent is paid. </p>
<p><b><u>TV Show Engine</u></b>: The central conflict of the series is the competition between the two businesses. ""The Czar"" is a well-established, well-funded and super-popular nightclub, that holds an iron grip on the town. While ""The Fortune Cookie"" is a struggling Chinese restaurant, run by dropouts, that's trying to become the most poppin' spot in town -- if they can even keep the lights on. It is essentially Rocky. . .But with nightclubs!</p>
<p><b><u>Tone</u></b>: This is the millennial version of ""Freaks and Geeks"" and ""Community.""  If ""The Breakfast Club"" became a series this would be it. Like all three of these school-based comedies, ""Dropouts"" carries a witty and playful tone all while focusing on the competition between the two nightclubs and spearheaded by two exes at war. The battle awakens one small town's decade's old rivalry between the local college students versus the dropouts.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550101308/ohffquc1rmvd51m0nfkx.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>For those looking for more information on the story, characters, and overall show, check out this pitch deck that describes the show in more detail:<a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/1qurg7v20ehib47/Dropouts%20Pitch%20Deck.pdf?dl=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Pitch Deck</a></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><b>WHY YOU SHOULD SUPPORT?</b></i></p>
<p>This brings us to the message of the show. Though our show is titled, “<i>Dropouts</i>”, this show <i><b>DOES NOT</b></i>  encourage students to drop out of college. Our show focuses on the idea of <i><b>SECOND CHANCES</b></i> and <i><b>INCLUSIVITY</b>!</i></p>
<p><span><u><strong>Second Chances:</strong></u> The show follows a group of young adults stuck in limbo, within a college town that does not accept them. Some are still working their way back to college, while others can’t even go back home due to their own personal reasons. It’s a time in their lives where what they do next could determine the rest of their entire lives. These kids have to convince the world for a second chance, whether it’s going back to college, winning back a loved one or having a shot at a career they always dreamed of. </span></p>
<p><u><strong>Inclusivity:</strong></u> The show supports diversity on and off screen. Our cast and crew hail from different backgrounds. Working on this project, we have learned from each other, shared with one another, and exchanged across cultures. Most importantly, we've determined to keep it that way throughout the production of our show, so that we can open more opportunities for people from all walks of life in an industry that still needs progress in that sector. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550101551/qkxbqjz0rhmymocabzh0.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><u><strong>Bonus:</strong></u> Our show <b>EMPOWERS WOMEN </b>on and behind the screen. Aside from creating opportunities behind the scene, we have created a number of strong female characters in the lead roles. Take STACEY for example, though she is our antagonist, she is a strong, independent, business-minded woman, whose main focus is to create a career for herself by any means necessary. She singlehandedly makes our group of outcasts team up to go up against her. But they have no idea what’s about to hit them! All I can tell you right now is that you’ll hate Stacey and fall in love with her at the same time. </p>

Concept: A rag-tag group of college dropouts struggle to prove that they can thrive in a town where college rules everything. 
Logline: Rhad, a college dropout and former nightclub employee trying to get back at his former boss - as well as his cheating girlfriend - convinces the employees at his new job (also dropouts) to turn their dying restaurant into a competing nightclub.
Synopsis: After RHAD finds his girlfriend, STACEY, hooking up with their boss, RANDALL, at the Czar Nightclub, Rhad quits his job and his girlfriend. His flamboyant roommate DONNIE then scores him a job interview at THE FORTUNE COOKIE RESTAURANT-- which to Rhad's surprise, is right across from the Czar. Rhad is then hired on the spot by LARRY, the bizarre, prank-pulling boss of The Fortune Cookie. Larry puts Rhad under the care of LIZ, the general manager and general narcissist. Hilarity is taken to extremes when ARTURO, the landlord with a dress shirt that struggles to hold back his potbelly, informs LARRY that he's being evicted unless back rent is paid. 
TV Show Engine: The central conflict of the series is the competition between the two businesses. ""The Czar"" is a well-established, well-funded and super-popular nightclub, that holds an iron grip on the town. While ""The Fortune Cookie"" is a struggling Chinese restaurant, run by dropouts, that's trying to become the most poppin' spot in town -- if they can even keep the lights on. It is essentially Rocky. . .But with nightclubs!
Tone: This is the millennial version of ""Freaks and Geeks"" and ""Community.""  If ""The Breakfast Club"" became a series this would be it. Like all three of these school-based comedies, ""Dropouts"" carries a witty and playful tone all while focusing on the competition between the two nightclubs and spearheaded by two exes at war. The battle awakens one small town's decade's old rivalry between the local college students versus the dropouts.

For those looking for more information on the story, characters, and overall show, check out this pitch deck that describes the show in more detail: Pitch Deck
WHY YOU SHOULD SUPPORT?
This brings us to the message of the show. Though our show is titled, “Dropouts”, this show DOES NOT  encourage students to drop out of college. Our show focuses on the idea of SECOND CHANCES and INCLUSIVITY!
Second Chances: The show follows a group of young adults stuck in limbo, within a college town that does not accept them. Some are still working their way back to college, while others can’t even go back home due to their own personal reasons. It’s a time in their lives where what they do next could determine the rest of their entire lives. These kids have to convince the world for a second chance, whether it’s going back to college, winning back a loved one or having a shot at a career they always dreamed of. 
Inclusivity: The show supports diversity on and off screen. Our cast and crew hail from different backgrounds. Working on this project, we have learned from each other, shared with one another, and exchanged across cultures. Most importantly, we've determined to keep it that way throughout the production of our show, so that we can open more opportunities for people from all walks of life in an industry that still needs progress in that sector. 

Bonus: Our show EMPOWERS WOMEN on and behind the screen. Aside from creating opportunities behind the scene, we have created a number of strong female characters in the lead roles. Take STACEY for example, though she is our antagonist, she is a strong, independent, business-minded woman, whose main focus is to create a career for herself by any means necessary. She singlehandedly makes our group of outcasts team up to go up against her. But they have no idea what’s about to hit them! All I can tell you right now is that you’ll hate Stacey and fall in love with her at the same time. 
             

#GOALS
Honestly, our goal is to entertain people, make'em laugh, and spread our message to as many people as possible. To do it efficiently, this means we will have to go mainstream... at some point.
Plan A: Depending on the amount of money we raise, we plan to independently shoot the entire first season, build an audience online, then pitch the show to studios and online streaming services like HBO, Showtime, Fox, Netflix etc, that we believe will be a great home for our project. This approach will not only help us create our show with more freedom but will also give us leverage when it’s time to involve big sharks. Much like how our dropouts will have to build their club from the ground up to compete and gain the attention of bigger organizations. As you already know, we can only achieve this goal with your support by donating and sharing the project with your family and friends! 
Plan B: Shoot the pilot episode of the show and use it as a proof of concept when pitching the show to studios and online streaming services. 
Timeline: We've begun the casting process, as well as attaching essential production crew members. Principal photography will begin in May 2019 for 5 days and we will have a final edit within 3 - 4 weeks. 
Fact is... we are in one of the most competitive industries in the world and having a great script is just not good enough to greenlight a television show. 
This is why we need all the support you can give to make this project happen!

<p>When we discuss the diversity issue in Hollywood, we often ignore people living with disabilities. This isn’t one of those series about a family dealing with their child’s disability. It’s about a boy with a disability living his life for himself, who can carry his own series.</p>
<p>To make matters short, Hugowood is the series that would’ve done me a lot of good to have in my younger years. I’m hoping to provide that for someone else. Also, it’s gay and amazing. Not donating would be considered a triple-hate crime. You don’t want to get canceled, right?</p>

From serving to being served, Front of House will explore what it is like to navigate the service industry and its challenges. WHO WE AREEmerging Productions was founded by actors and filmmakers trying to make their way through the industry.  While juggling day jobs, auditions, and projects alike, our group came together with a passion to create excellent content and share great stories. FRONT OF HOUSE is a bit of a passion project for all of us.  We all have worked, or currently work within the service industry. One day, we were discussing endless accounts of our own personal bizarre interactions, nightmare events, that ONE customer, non-stop problems, and the sometimes very generous and the frequent not-so-generous... circumstances.  This conversation grew into an idea and realization.  We realized the need to wrap these stories, told and untold, into a fun ADVENTURE where characters at different points in their lives come together and face their struggles head on.  After all, a restaurant is a gathering place of people from all walks of life to take part in a synonymous fellowship: EAT... and/or complain~With the script and cast ready, we are poised to film the pilot episode come this September. We are excited to present and share this project with you and would like to extend the opportunity for you to collaborate with us in bringing this fun story to life!  HOW YOU CAN CONTRIBUTE!We aim to raise a budget of $10,000 dollars in order to film this pilot episode. Our expenses will cover Equipment, Production Design, Post Production, and the care of our Cast and Crew.  The following graph reflects the allocation of our budget: We will be filming on the remarkable ARRI ALEXA MINI to capture the best performances in fullness and beauty and are set to film the pilot episode in the charming Mariposa, California.  Your contribution will be wisely managed and invested to take this proof-of-concept and develop it into a full series. We plan to approach major networks with intention of getting this concept picked up and ordered into a show with major backing. We can make this happen!   WHY COLLABORATE WITH US?Front of House is a concept that really draws on the SYNERGY and TRUTH of the shared experiences of EVERYONE. Furthermore, we want to be able to INSPIRE and ENCOURAGE the imagination and creativity of everyone who watches this show, especially the individuals who front the lines of the SERVICE industry. OPPORTUNITY is waiting around the corner for everyone. Just make sure to yell ""CORNER!"" while you're on your way to cease it. THE TEAM AdministrationMonique grew up in beautiful Orange County until the age of 22 when she decided to make the move up to the traffic infested city we know as Los Angeles.

Pillow Talk is a huge undertaking, but Emilia firmly believes in the heart of the series and the importance of its voice. I’m so excited to be working with her on this project - there’s no one I’d rather be working/binging biscuits with.(Bio written by Calum Bradshaw)Screenwriter - Josh BourneJosh brings a unique voice and incredible creative talent to Pillow Talk. He is particularly passionate about highlighting issues which are less frequently addressed in the media, and enjoys writing character-driven stories which combine moments of drama and comedy - one memorable moment was a sword fight using a vacuum and mop as weapons…! He wrote several short plays while at university which were put on to sell-out success and critical acclaim, and he is now pursuing his dream of writing for the screen. I was lucky enough to produce several of Josh’s plays over the past couple years, and I’m thrilled to be working with him again to bring this story to life!(Bio written by Emilia Clark)Director - Calum Bradshaw As he has mentioned, Calum and I first met on a film set halfway up a mountain three years ago, and since then I have been continuously amazed by his talent, his creative vision, and the incredible energy he brings to everything he does. Collaborating with him on this project so far has been a dream come true, and getting an insight into his creative process and approach to filmmaking has taught me so much! Having directed multiple productions both at university and beyond, Calum has honed his skills and is excited to be working on a larger scale on Pillow Talk to bring this story to life. I couldn’t be more grateful to be collaborating with him again, and I’m so excited to see what he and the team create, and to continue our commitment to chocolate biscuits…! (Bio written by Emilia Clark)… and Charithra Chandran, who plays Stella!Charithra is one of the most exciting up-and-coming actresses that I’ve had the pleasure to work with! Having acted successfully in several theatrical productions throughout her time at university, Charithra has exploded onto the film and TV scene. We’re so excited to be working with her on Pillow Talk!(Bio written by Emilia Clark)Not to mention...We’re very lucky to be working with an incredible crew on Pillow Talk, some of whom you will have seen in the photos above! A particular shout-out goes to Alex, our DP - Calum and Alex have worked together on multiple projects before, and have developed a wonderful synergy and creative partnership. You’ll also see Clem, our gaffer, Daniela, our production designer, Dan, our AD, Monaya, our AC, Will, our sound recordist, Kyle, our script supervisor, Anna, our intimacy coordinator, and Fran, our graphic designer!",9.0,1,"1 Campaign

Network television is broadcasting content that is growing increasingly immoral each year. The internet is filled with perverse websites and videos. Practices like abortion, which our society once criminalized, are now legal and embraced. More and more states are enabling a culture that is increasingly dependent upon and addicted to drugs. Even basic scientific and biological facts about gender are thrown out the window at universities.</p><p><strong>How did we get here?</strong></p><p>On one major exit from the road less traveled, we exchanged the truth of the Creator for the theory of evolution (Romans 1:18-32). This lie about origins and identity is a major force in the anti-God / anti-Bible movement sweeping the planet. It’s no surprise either, as the Apostle Peter prophesied that such delusions would be widespread as we get closer and closer to the final generation.</p><p><strong>So what can we do?</strong></p><p>Do we simply wait around until death, the rapture, judgement day? Do we stand by quietly and watch as the world reverts back to the days of Noah? Do we only concern ourselves with our local church, or tithing to a remote orphanage? No, Jesus clearly taught us that we should neglect neither the care of orphans and widows, nor the spreading of the gospel to the lost among us. It’s a sad fact that when a lie is packaged in amazing graphics, it is likely to be accepted. This is making it more difficult to share the truth of real science, real history and the Bible, because the Church is often unable to compete at the same production levels as the larger secular marketplace. YOU CAN HELP US CHANGE THAT.</p><p><i>Quantum</i> stands ready to make bold advances by offering spectacular visuals, a compelling story-line parallel to the battle of the believer, and incredible lessons in genuine science and history that will destroy many of the lies that have brainwashed our undiscerning youth (2 Corinthians 10:3-5).</p><p> </p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1523153293/ijthun2efp2wypsse8bn.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1523154060/jf8srrdtrwk69f0wucx8.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Ralph Strean, the director and producer of <i>Quantum, </i>also directed and produced the successful crowdfunder-backed production <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/genesis-3d-movie/x/18410463#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Genesis: Paradise Lost</i></a><i>, </i>which was crowdfunded right here on <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/genesis-3d-movie/x/18410463#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Indiegogo</a> and released in theaters just last year.

<p>Making, marketing, and distributing a quality, independent feature film is a long and painstaking process. It took us a total of eight years of hard work, personal sacrifices, a lot of patience, and a lot of money (to us anyway, far from Hollywood’s deep pockets). The end result is certainly rewarding and something I'd love to do again, but for now I want to take a break from moviemaking and prayerfully work on a series that can provide immediate benefits (especially in testimonials), and quicker results for supporters. Furthermore, <i>GPL </i>(Part 1) is still in the process of recouping its costs, so it may take a while before the <i>GPL</i> team can afford to jump into pre-production for Part 2. <i>Quantum </i>can continue to satisfy the eager eyes and ears of those waiting on Part 2. So as with <i>GPL</i>, if you put up the money, we’ll put in the professional work!</p>
<p><strong>How much will this adhere to the Bible, will it be accurate?</strong></p>
</div><p>Our number one goal is to treat God’s word with reverence, and thereby ensure that our creative liberties do not violate the clear teaching of Scripture. Although <i>Quantum </i>will have futuristic “science fiction” elements, the genre will lean more heavily towards “science fact,” if you will, with some fantastic elements that don't conflict with the Bible. </p><p><strong>When will I receive my perks?</strong></p><p>Perks related to season 1 (pilot season) are distributed upon the completion of episode 1 (season 1) at the earliest. Other perks, such as behind-the-scenes access, will be available immediately upon their respective posts. We will be updating you after the campaign ends with a report on what to expect regarding release times for your perks.</p><p><strong>Where will my online access (of episodes) be?</strong></p><p>We will be working with an ""aggregator"" to push the series to as many online vendors as we can, such as iTunes, Amazon, Google Play, etc. However, certain vendors do not allow coupon codes to be applied. We're working on a solution to this issue so that you'll be able to access the episodes on your platform of preference.

Are you tired of seeing yet another unchallenged show that props up the delusional ""scientific consensus""?  Have you seen the programs on Discovery or NOVA and were frustrated or even angry that they're passing off the theory of evolution as fact, and teaching our youth that there is no God? Are you watching the news today where kids are shooting each other in schools, and you know why it's happening but you don't know what you can do about it?PLEASE JOIN US. We need your support to raise the funds to create a new online series called Quantum. It will be the first Bible-based series of its kind. Beginning in 2019, Cosmos and other propaganda pieces will be cross-examined. After all, the real cosmos is God's cosmos!What is the plot in simple terms?A time traveler must go back to the past, on a mission to send to the present a message about the future. Excited? Scroll down to learn more... In 2013 you gave over $250,000 to our Indiegogo campaign to support Genesis 3D, and we delivered! We were faithful with your support and created an acclaimed feature film released nation-wide. A special 4D version will soon be showing at the Creation Museum in Kentucky. By the grace of God, a dream was transformed into a reality.Now I'm asking for your help again. Quantum will be Sevenfold Films' first independent, breakout series. Quantum will be released online and on Blu-ray and DVD. It is hosted by Dr. Charles Jackson (from Genesis: Paradise Lost) and the new series will teach real science and real history from the only true perspective there is: the Biblical one! We'll use the latest technology to create visually stunning sequences (like Genesis, but even better), with an incredible story-line centered around time travel and a battle of Biblical magnitude. Quantum will be made for all audiences but is oriented towards high-school age and up, and will tackle many of the most controversial topics of today. Quantum isn't just relevant. It's showing up for battle in an ongoing war zone: the world-wide web. We need your support to help free those taken captive in the “culture wars”!  It’s easy to see that violence in our schools is spiraling out of control. Network television is broadcasting content that is growing increasingly immoral each year. The internet is filled with perverse websites and videos. Practices like abortion, which our society once criminalized, are now legal and embraced. More and more states are enabling a culture that is increasingly dependent upon and addicted to drugs. Even basic scientific and biological facts about gender are thrown out the window at universities.How did we get here?On one major exit from the road less traveled, we exchanged the truth of the Creator for the theory of evolution (Romans 1:18-32). This lie about origins and identity is a major force in the anti-God / anti-Bible movement sweeping the planet. It’s no surprise either, as the Apostle Peter prophesied that such delusions would be widespread as we get closer and closer to the final generation.So what can we do?Do we simply wait around until death, the rapture, judgement day? Do we stand by quietly and watch as the world reverts back to the days of Noah? Do we only concern ourselves with our local church, or tithing to a remote orphanage? No, Jesus clearly taught us that we should neglect neither the care of orphans and widows, nor the spreading of the gospel to the lost among us. It’s a sad fact that when a lie is packaged in amazing graphics, it is likely to be accepted. This is making it more difficult to share the truth of real science, real history and the Bible, because the Church is often unable to compete at the same production levels as the larger secular marketplace. YOU CAN HELP US CHANGE THAT.Quantum stands ready to make bold advances by offering spectacular visuals, a compelling story-line parallel to the battle of the believer, and incredible lessons in genuine science and history that will destroy many of the lies that have brainwashed our undiscerning youth (2 Corinthians 10:3-5).  Ralph Strean, the director and producer of Quantum, also directed and produced the successful crowdfunder-backed production Genesis: Paradise Lost, which was crowdfunded right here on Indiegogo and released in theaters just last year. Tim Gwynn, a researcher and screenwriter of Sevenfold’s exceptional documentary, is hopeful that God will also provide funding for our new media venture (Quantum) through people like you. Please help us continue to blaze trails; to carry the gospel torch in defiance of the ""consensus country club"" media! Genesis: Paradise Lost was the first 3D Christian film ever produced and has recently been nominated for five different awards from the upcoming International Christian Film Festival: Best Documentary, Best Animation, Most Creative, Most Inspirational, and Best Director. We as believers are instructed to store up treasures in Heaven (where our real rewards are), but such affirmation helps demonstrate that your hard-earned dollars are in competent hands, for the glory of God!  All you need to do is select a perk from the menu to the right and contribute to our cause. If you can't find a perk that's just right for you, you can also enter a custom dollar amount at the top of the page by clicking ""BACK IT."" For easy reference, we also included the following quick-sheet:   Our favorite personality packing four science degrees, Dr. Charles Jackson is returning from the documentary feature Genesis: Paradise Lost  to host Quantum! Pictured below are Dr. Jackson and Director / Producer Ralph Strean of Genesis: Paradise Lost. Ralph and Dr. Jackson enjoyed collaborating on the film and are eager to team up again for this new media venture. Be sure to watch the featured video at the top of the page for an interview between the two, detailing the project.A plan is also in the works for Dr. Jackson to host an after-show with each engaging episode, featuring special guests from various fields of study. The after-shows will further expound upon the topics from their respective episodes.   With a concept like time travel, it's no secret that Quantum must utilize a lot of digital effects. Unlike Genesis: Paradise Lost -- a film involving 3D stylized animation --Quantum will neither be stylized nor animated but will instead opt for photorealism. To achieve a photo-real look, ""background plates"" are shot from actual locations and then digital effects are later composited on top of them. The triceratops frame from the above teaser video is one such example. Take a look at the process:As you can see, the final result is virtually indistinguishable from a set prop or animatronic dinosaur. It is with these techniques, your support, and ultimately by God’s grace that Quantum will be created.   Quantum will address a number of topics, woven throughout its story-line that spans each season. The following columns contain theoretical topics that have been proposed for season 1. If you don't see a topic that you think should be on the list, be patient as we'll be announcing votes on new topics soon.  Our goals for this campaign can be divided into a three-level structure. Level 1 - get the funds to begin the production of the series with the minimal number of episodes (3 at 30 minutes each, roughly feature-film length in total). Level 2 - reach our goal for funds to round out season one with a standard number of episodes (5 or 6 episodes at 30-45 minutes each). Level 3 - reach our optimal goal of 9 or 10 episodes with all the extras.Here's an approximate summary of how those funds will be utilized, based on the $250K goal:   What about “Genesis Part 2”?A message from the director:

When she is bitten by a vampire, it awakens in her a latent ability to kick demonic ass. The story takes place in the fictional town of Stoker, MA, a Gothic, Salem-like setting teeming with hordes of the undead and demonic forces, the results of an ancient curse placed upon the town when it was settled. When settlers came upon the land, they ran off the native inhabitants in order to colonize. Seeking revenge they placed a curse upon the town that it be forever overrun with evil, in hopes that the town wouldn’t survive. A priest and several others of power put a protection spell around the town to keep evil as contained as possible. But the spell has been wearing thin over time and Koko's ""rebirth"" causes an anomaly, ripping a hole in it, allowing the dark forces entry. A semi-dark, semi-campy story with its share of blood, foul language, and demonic ass kicking.

the Animation Hall Of Fame has been working and structuring this television series for many years, there are always going to be unforeseen obstacles to overcome. Which we will persevere successfully!</p><p>In regard to risks, our number one is the unexpected illness of an individual that we are scheduled to interview, while on location. Being able to reschedule and restructure our production schedule on a moment’s notice and being able to shoot other interviews or visit other locations have been calculated in and will solve this issue.</p><p>Another all too common risk is equipment glitches or failures. However with the advent of a digital production such as ours and having sufficient backup equipment we can avoid any down time based around these issues.</p><p>The number one challenge has always been and will continue to be time itself. But, by allowing an appropriate amount of time, plus calculating in an additional margin for whatever situation may occur, we can minimize and defeat these challenges making for a much smoother running and more cost effective production.</p><p>Once again having 45 years of pre-production, production, and post production experience allows me the option of tackling these situations head on. Effectively keeping the production on time and on budget, if not ahead of time and budget, and delivering the material we need for this great television series production.</p></div>","The Animation Hall Of Fame’s Journey Into IMAGIMATION Television Series is the ground breaking in-depth television series covering for the first time ever the extensive international history of this great entertainment art form.Never in the history of animation has such an international television series of this scope and caliber ever been attempted.

unforeseen obstacles to overcome. Which we will persevere successfully!In regard to risks, our number one is the unexpected illness of an individual that we are scheduled to interview, while on location. Being able to reschedule and restructure our production schedule on a moment’s notice and being able to shoot other interviews or visit other locations have been calculated in and will solve this issue.Another all too common risk is equipment glitches or failures. However with the advent of a digital production such as ours and having sufficient backup equipment we can avoid any down time based around these issues.The number one challenge has always been and will continue to be time itself. But, by allowing an appropriate amount of time, plus calculating in an additional margin for whatever situation may occur, we can minimize and defeat these challenges making for a much smoother running and more cost effective production.Once again having 45 years of pre-production, production, and post production experience allows me the option of tackling these situations head on. Effectively keeping the production on time and on budget, if not ahead of time and budget, and delivering the material we need for this great television series production.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h3>Welcome! Start Here. Did You Watch the Video?</h3><p>Hi! I'm Jamin Keene. Fabulous secrets were revealed to me the day I held aloft my<strong>*</strong> laptop in Washington, DC, and said, ""I'm tired of chasing work as an actor. How can I do more?"" The sparkles rained down, some random choir sang, and I transformed from a management consultant to what I am today - an actor, filmmaker, and passable karaoke singer in Los Angeles, California, who developed a web series based on a play that I wrote based on my experiences dating in DC. Add in two characters who portray my main character's best friends and we've got ourselves a series!</p><p>Before this series I wrote, produced, and directed a short film, which was released in March 2019, and also have produced a weekly vlog and podcast covering political and gay topics in a humorous format.</p><p>(<strong>*</strong>That third sentence at the top was from my second favorite cartoon growing up, the original <i>She-Ra</i>. If you didn't know that, it's okay. What's important is that I referenced a cartoon for girls, which lets you know just how authentically gay I am for such a time as this.)<br/> </p><h3>Why is <i>Vinegar Water</i> important?</h3><p>This series is important to me because it's important for black gay guys like me and others to have representation in entertainment with stories that we tell about ourselves and not letting others tell our stories for us. I first loved <i>Noah's Arc</i> for telling black gay stories. Then everything there stopped once the show ended. </p><p>I loved <i>Queer as Folk </i>and <i>Will &amp; Grace</i>, but that's not really ""my"" story. As I look online, I see web series based on the black gay experience, but I don't see ones that show characters who offer what <i>Vinegar Water</i> offers: gay men who embrace yet don't know who they are and struggle with their faith (not necessarily the church), struggle with sex as an addiction but pass it off as being sexually liberated, or have questionable dating choices when they should know better. All of that helping to grow them up into more mature adulthood.</p><p>These are funny stories full of outrageous plots and characters based on real life. Also, quiet as it's kept, <strong>I never saw anyone tackle gay interracial dating honestly</strong>, <i>and there is plenty of opportunity to upset a lot of people with the truth of that</i>, so why not do that, you know? <i>I live for provocative content!</i><br/> </p><h3>""What Would We Need for This Series?""</h3><p>Bottom line: This will take money to produce a quality show and <strong>I'd love your support</strong> in making this show a reality! </p><p><strong>We need five things:</strong></p><p><strong>1. You.<br/>2. Money.<br/>3. Excitement.<br/>4. Prayers for its success.<br/>5. Prayers for money, your excitement, and its success.</strong></p><p><u><strong>You</strong></u></p><ul><li>You are needed because without you, this show cannot be brought to life. Why you? Not just your donations, but you are the key to sharing excitement about this show, sharing information for this fundraiser with people, and the best advertisement we could ask for: word of mouth. Also, you may get your name listed in the credits. Haven't you always wanted to see your name in lights? If not, add that to your life goals. It's never too late to achieve your goals! </li></ul><p><u><strong>Money</strong></u></p><ul><li>
<strong>It takes money to make anything in Hollywood </strong>and none of us working on the series has enough to make this happen, so we do need donations. The best we've done so far with the money we had is hold auditions, shoot the fundraiser promo video and get it cut (i.e. - edited) for the public. A full show takes more, even for a web series.<br/><br/>While we're not The Crown on Netflix with a budget of $10 million per episode, we do have costs. For example, there are costs associated with permits for outdoor locations and studio time charged for indoor locations, and some people charge to use their homes. That can easily go into the $1000s. <br/><br/>Also, with talent and crew to make a quality-level show, it will take some doing to pay the right rates to get the right people for the job. Who are the people we need to pay to make a quality show?<br/>​<ul>
<li>
<strong>Actors</strong> - the people who bring the series to life playing characters on screen</li>
<li>
<strong>Line Producer</strong> - the person who scouts and finds locations</li>
<li>
<strong>Director of Photography</strong> - the person who directs and sets the tone of the series with each shot</li>
<li>
<strong>Editor</strong> - the person who assembles the episodes for an audience to see</li>
<li>
<strong>Production Assistant</strong> - the person who assists on set with the production with everything from sound, design, lighting, coordinating schedules, coordinating actors, ordering food, and other duties</li>
<li>
<strong>Makeup/Hair Artist</strong> - the person who helps the actors achieve the required look on camera </li>
<li>
<strong>Sound Person</strong> - the person who gets the sound right for the series on set</li>
<li>
<strong>Gaffer/Grip</strong> - the person who designs lighting and sets the right light for scenes on set</li>
<li>
<strong>Script Supervisor</strong> - the person who makes sure the actors are saying the right lines</li>
<li>
<strong>Music</strong> - the music used in the web series has to be paid for to the artist or composer</li>
</ul>
</li></ul><p><u><strong>Excitement</strong></u></p><ul><li>We need excitement for this. If you or someone you know identifies with the storyline or finds it interesting, TELL THEM TO CHECK THIS OUT! We take all support and believe this is a show that is timely, unique, and hopefully needed now. </li></ul><p><u><strong>Prayers for Its Success</strong></u></p><ul><li>I believe in the power of prayer and am praying for the success of <i>Vinegar Water</i>. But first, I'm praying for the success of this fundraiser. If you can't donate, please share it with someone who can. If you pray, please join me in prayer for success for Vinegar Water to get produced and in front of the right people to build a fan base to take it all the way.<br/><br/>If you can donate, share, <strong><i>and</i></strong> pray, that's the gay trifecta. You're now gay. Welcome to the family! I'm kidding. It's doesn't work like that. You have to pay a fee to the gay mafia to be gay nowadays and it's a whole thing I don't have time to get into right now. </li></ul><p><u><strong>Prayers for Money, Your Excitement, and Its Success</strong></u></p><ul><li>This is my prayer for you all. Again, if this web series touches you in a way that you find endearing or you know someone who would like it, please share it with them.</li></ul><h3>
<br/>What Happens If We Don't Reach Our Goal?</h3><p>I will have to start stripping for wealthy business travelers (again). But really, if we don't reach our goal, we will go ahead with what we have, but the quality of the show will suffer, and I really want to present a polished show. The less money we have, the more challenges there will be with regard to locations, equipment, talent, and crew. While I believe I am qualified with the people I have interested in helping (they do need to get paid) to overcome these challenges, I would prefer that we did not have to face those challenges on top of the normal challenges. </p><p>Therefore, I'd love you to give what you can to help us do that.

Start Here. Did You Watch the Video?Hi! I'm Jamin Keene. Fabulous secrets were revealed to me the day I held aloft my* laptop in Washington, DC, and said, ""I'm tired of chasing work as an actor. How can I do more?"" The sparkles rained down, some random choir sang, and I transformed from a management consultant to what I am today - an actor, filmmaker, and passable karaoke singer in Los Angeles, California, who developed a web series based on a play that I wrote based on my experiences dating in DC. Add in two characters who portray my main character's best friends and we've got ourselves a series!Before this series I wrote, produced, and directed a short film, which was released in March 2019, and also have produced a weekly vlog and podcast covering political and gay topics in a humorous format.(*That third sentence at the top was from my second favorite cartoon growing up, the original She-Ra. If you didn't know that, it's okay. What's important is that I referenced a cartoon for girls, which lets you know just how authentically gay I am for such a time as this.) Why is Vinegar Water important?This series is important to me because it's important for black gay guys like me and others to have representation in entertainment with stories that we tell about ourselves and not letting others tell our stories for us. I first loved Noah's Arc for telling black gay stories. Then everything there stopped once the show ended. I loved Queer as Folk and Will & Grace, but that's not really ""my"" story. As I look online, I see web series based on the black gay experience, but I don't see ones that show characters who offer what Vinegar Water offers: gay men who embrace yet don't know who they are and struggle with their faith (not necessarily the church), struggle with sex as an addiction but pass it off as being sexually liberated, or have questionable dating choices when they should know better. All of that helping to grow them up into more mature adulthood.These are funny stories full of outrageous plots and characters based on real life. Also, quiet as it's kept, I never saw anyone tackle gay interracial dating honestly, and there is plenty of opportunity to upset a lot of people with the truth of that, so why not do that, you know? I live for provocative content! ""What Would We Need for This Series?""Bottom line: This will take money to produce a quality show and I'd love your support in making this show a reality! We need five things:1. You.2. Money.3. Excitement.4. Prayers for its success.5. Prayers for money, your excitement, and its success.YouYou are needed because without you, this show cannot be brought to life. Why you? Not just your donations, but you are the key to sharing excitement about this show, sharing information for this fundraiser with people, and the best advertisement we could ask for: word of mouth. Also, you may get your name listed in the credits. Haven't you always wanted to see your name in lights? If not, add that to your life goals. It's never too late to achieve your goals! Money
It takes money to make anything in Hollywood and none of us working on the series has enough to make this happen, so we do need donations. The best we've done so far with the money we had is hold auditions, shoot the fundraiser promo video and get it cut (i.e. - edited) for the public. A full show takes more, even for a web series.While we're not The Crown on Netflix with a budget of $10 million per episode, we do have costs. For example, there are costs associated with permits for outdoor locations and studio time charged for indoor locations, and some people charge to use their homes. That can easily go into the $1000s. Also, with talent and crew to make a quality-level show, it will take some doing to pay the right rates to get the right people for the job. Who are the people we need to pay to make a quality show?​

Actors - the people who bring the series to life playing characters on screen

Line Producer - the person who scouts and finds locations

Director of Photography - the person who directs and sets the tone of the series with each shot

Editor - the person who assembles the episodes for an audience to see

Production Assistant - the person who assists on set with the production with everything from sound, design, lighting, coordinating schedules, coordinating actors, ordering food, and other duties

Makeup/Hair Artist - the person who helps the actors achieve the required look on camera 

Sound Person - the person who gets the sound right for the series on set

Gaffer/Grip - the person who designs lighting and sets the right light for scenes on set

Script Supervisor - the person who makes sure the actors are saying the right lines

Music - the music used in the web series has to be paid for to the artist or composer

ExcitementWe need excitement for this. If you or someone you know identifies with the storyline or finds it interesting, TELL THEM TO CHECK THIS OUT! We take all support and believe this is a show that is timely, unique, and hopefully needed now. Prayers for Its SuccessI believe in the power of prayer and am praying for the success of Vinegar Water. But first, I'm praying for the success of this fundraiser. If you can't donate, please share it with someone who can. If you pray, please join me in prayer for success for Vinegar Water to get produced and in front of the right people to build a fan base to take it all the way.If you can donate, share, and pray, that's the gay trifecta. You're now gay. Welcome to the family! I'm kidding. It's doesn't work like that. You have to pay a fee to the gay mafia to be gay nowadays and it's a whole thing I don't have time to get into right now. Prayers for Money, Your Excitement, and Its SuccessThis is my prayer for you all. Again, if this web series touches you in a way that you find endearing or you know someone who would like it, please share it with them.
What Happens If We Don't Reach Our Goal?I will have to start stripping for wealthy business travelers (again). But really, if we don't reach our goal, we will go ahead with what we have, but the quality of the show will suffer, and I really want to present a polished show. The less money we have, the more challenges there will be with regard to locations, equipment, talent, and crew. While I believe I am qualified with the people I have interested in helping (they do need to get paid) to overcome these challenges, I would prefer that we did not have to face those challenges on top of the normal challenges. Therefore, I'd love you to give what you can to help us do that. If you cannot give financially, sharing this fundraiser (see the SHARE TOOLS on this page) with people who would be interested and those who would also give is appreciated. Your prayers for its success are appreciated too.Whatever support you give, MAKE IT LOUD and MAKE IT COUNT! Thank you for your support in advance! Much love to all! - Jamin Keene & the Vinegar Water team Promo Team:Keontae: Jamin Keene, repped by The Brogan AgencyAmin: Kojo OduroBlake: L.C.

<h3><u>Welcome to Sommoners Tale</u></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Hi! Thanks for visiting our fundraising page. We’re raising funds for an independent magical-realism television series called Sommoners Tale (spelling intentional!)</p>
<p>What is “magical-realism,” you might be wondering? Essentially we're combining 2 genres: it’s a show based in our modern world, while utilizing all the amazing features of the fantasy/magical genre:</p>
<p><strong>Our series is about a bullied young man who turns to the world of magic and spellcasting to help him cope- but he unwittingly becomes entangled in an ancient battle between the Light and Dark. Turns out, he's a very special young man and his role could be the turning point for this battle. With the help of a magical guardian, another Mage ally, and an incredible Book, this troubled young man may just decide the fate of the entire world!</strong></p> <p><u>WHO WE ARE</u>:</p>
<p>The creative team behind this project consists of Brandon Smelko- creator/writer/director/actor, and Tina Christner- creator/lead writer/assistant director. We are 2 very passionate creatives who have spent the last 9 months developing this fantastic story, writing the script, getting actors, finding locations, and even putting together costumes and a photoshoot for Sommoners Tale.</p> <p>After all this hard work, we're ready to move into the shooting phase. <strong>Now we need YOUR help to turn this dream into reality.</strong> So… we need backers! People who want to be “patrons of the arts;” people who want to take an active role in their entertainment; people who want to help produce an extraordinary show.</p> <p><u>More about Sommoners Tale</u>:</p>
<p>We classify our show as “magical-realism.” This means that we're using our current modern world (realism) as our backdrop, while incorporating fantastical/magical elements. We've also drawn inspiration from the science-fiction genre, classic mythology, and current real events.  We seek to not only entertain with some cool action and an intricate storyline, we're also addressing contemporary topics and social issues at the forefront of modern life. Sommoners Tale uses the lens of fantasy/magic to tackle some major topics and problems. Nothing is off-limits to us. We want to spark discussion and explore life.  Otherwise “sensitive” topics receive the ‘fantasy’ treatment- not unlike Gene Roddenberry and his Star Trek themes.</p>
<p><i>Some of our key topics:</i></p>
<p>Gender roles</p>
<p>Stereotypes</p>
<p>Sexuality</p>
<p>Bullying</p>
<p>Climate change</p>
<p>Politics</p>
<p>Social environments</p>
<p><strong>We want to explore this crazy world we all live in, and we want to share this journey with you in the form of this TV series, Sommoners Tale.</strong></p> <p><i>Some specifics about our particular production:</i></p>
<p>We're using local talent (cast and crew)</p>
<p>We're featuring LGBTQ actors</p>
<p>We're giving some really amazing talent a chance to shine</p> <p><strong>So, why do we need money?</strong></p>
<p>Well, obviously this sort of thing is expensive. Embarking on this journey, we have come to find all these various elements required for indie filmmaking. And most of them cost money! Things we didn't even know about- things you might not know about, like:</p>
<p><i>Fight choreographer</i></p>
<p><i>Permits (locations)</i></p>
<p><i>Lighting rentals</i></p>
<p><i>Marketing/promo materials</i></p>
<p><i>Regular photography</i></p>
<p><i>A lawyer!</i></p>
<p>We've been truly blessed to have a lot of talented people donating their time and abilities to Sommoners Tale, but it would be fantastic if we could compensate these wonderful people for their efforts!</p> <p><strong>So, please, check out our perks and help us bring Sommoners Tale to life!</strong></p>
<p>And check out our social media links for some awesome content and updates! Feel free to email us with any questions.</p>

<p><strong>THANK YOU SO MUCH!!</strong></p>
