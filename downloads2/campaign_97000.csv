<p> Our plan is to complete all the models by November/December 2016 and complete shipping no later of February 2017. This delivery date is an estimate as several factors may influence the production time.

Stretch goals that unlock new models might also slightly delay the estimated delivery time in order to finalize the sculpture. So far we have been pretty good in meeting our deadline and our last 2 campaigns we ran on another crowdfunding platform where shipped either earlier than estimated or on time.<br/><br/>Resin models: <br/><br/>All models will be available both in metal or resin.

<h3>The world needs more hex maps!</h3>
<p>Thanks to decades of popular role-playing games, RPGs on square grids are plentiful and readily available.  Sometimes, though, you want to play on a hex grid.  Hex maps are scarce, despite growing demand for them.  <i>Tactical Hex Maps</i> by Grognard's Realm is a beautiful, 24-page, 8x10 booklet featuring 25 maps for dungeon exploring, man-to-man (or man-to-beast) combat, and daring adventures.</p>
<ul>
<li>Grognard's Realm is run by ""Tollenkar"", the administrator of the Discord server <i>The Fantasy Trip</i>, a social network for players of the classic game by Steve Jackson Games.  (Tollenkar is a registered trademark of Steve Jackson Games.)</li>
<li>As a fan of hex-and-counter games, Tollenkar began hand-drawing his own hex maps to fill the void.  The intent was always to share these maps with the Fantasy RPG community.</li>
<li>By contributing to this campaign, you will help proliferate the availability of tactical hex maps, and grow this resource for the community.</li>
</ul>
<p>While these maps were designed with <i>The Fantasy Trip</i> in mind, they can be used with any FRPG system.</p>

<h3>A modest goal</h3>
<p>The goal for this campaign is a mere $800.</p>

<li>If only 75 people bought only one copy of the book, the goal will be met.</li>
<li>Some of these hex maps are available as professionally-printed hex boards.  Five of these maps are available in this crowdfunding campaign, with those maps' scenarios described in the books.  These map boards are available as add-ons to those who purchase at least one book.</li>
<li>If the goal is not met, the funds will be used to produce a first edition short print run of this book, making it a rare collector's item!</li>

The world needs more hex maps!
Thanks to decades of popular role-playing games, RPGs on square grids are plentiful and readily available.  Sometimes, though, you want to play on a hex grid.  Hex maps are scarce, despite growing demand for them.  Tactical Hex Maps by Grognard's Realm is a beautiful, 24-page, 8x10 booklet featuring 25 maps for dungeon exploring, man-to-man (or man-to-beast) combat, and daring adventures.

Grognard's Realm is run by ""Tollenkar"", the administrator of the Discord server The Fantasy Trip, a social network for players of the classic game by Steve Jackson Games.  (Tollenkar is a registered trademark of Steve Jackson Games.)
As a fan of hex-and-counter games, Tollenkar began hand-drawing his own hex maps to fill the void.  The intent was always to share these maps with the Fantasy RPG community.
By contributing to this campaign, you will help proliferate the availability of tactical hex maps, and grow this resource for the community.

While these maps were designed with The Fantasy Trip in mind, they can be used with any FRPG system.

A modest goal
The goal for this campaign is a mere $800.

If only 75 people bought only one copy of the book, the goal will be met.
Some of these hex maps are available as professionally-printed hex boards.  Five of these maps are available in this crowdfunding campaign, with those maps' scenarios described in the books.  These map boards are available as add-ons to those who purchase at least one book.
If the goal is not met, the funds will be used to produce a first edition short print run of this book, making it a rare collector's item!


A much-needed resource
Your contribution to this project will make a difference.

By bringing this project to fruition, the RPG community will have greater access to varied hex maps.
If successful, this will encourage Grognard's Realm, and others, to increase hex maps' availablity.
Books like this will help grow the fantasy RPG  community.


Risk management
The goal is to produce this book in numbers that adequately meet demand.

This crowdfunding campaign will help to gauge the demand for this item.
By partaking in this campaign, we can better assess the optimum quantity to produce, and predict if there is a demand for more such books.

Even if you don't plan to, or are unable to make a purchase, there are ways you can help make this project a success:

<li>
<strong>Equip!</strong> You quickly search through the available armor in market, paying for any armor you wish to keep! Some armor will protect you and give you lots of hit points, some will give you better dice to fight with, and others will give you special powers! But you must decide quickly... because you only have 1 minute to equip your Chibi for battle!</li>
<li>
<strong>Battle!</strong> Then you battle monsters! You do this by collecting all the dice shown on your armor cards. Some monsters are stronger than others and you must meet the sword requirements to beat the monster, otherwise they damage YOU! If you defeat a monster you then follow the actions listed on that monsters card. Sometimes they give you gold, sometimes they cause you to loose armor, and sometimes they become your sidekick and help you fight!</li>
<li>
<strong>Shop until you drop! </strong>Or in this case, fight until you faint! The first Chibi to cover up all his or her hit points faints! At this point you finish out the round so everyone has an equal number of turns.</li>
<li>
<strong>BOSS FIGHT! </strong>Then everyone will have another minute to equip their Chibis with fresh, undamaged armor.  Afterwards, you must fight together to defeat the BOSS!</li>
<li>
<strong>WIN or LOSE! </strong>If you defeat the BOSS you are all winners! But there is only ONE Champion Chibi. You count up all your points, and whoever has the most is known throughout the lands as the Champion Chibi!</li>

Show your support for it today by backing a perk! Please understand, I am not selling retail copies of the game.

If you'd really like a copy, please pledge $1 to let Hasbro know you'd like Chibi Quest! to get printed!  If you'd really like a copy, I will have a very limited print run of a professionally printed, prototype version of Chibi Quest, but it's expensive!

Each Chibi wakes up to a new day of saving the world, but you can’t go into battle in your PJ’s! You must equip your Chibi properly! However, saving the world doesn’t wait on you, so you must do this quickly! You will have one minute to equip your Chibi with awesome weapons, special powers, and even cool mounts! Then it’s up to you to save the world from as many monsters as you can before you get tired and go back to bed. Chibi Quest! is relatable to the whole family. There is a bit of nostalgia for the older generations who may remember growing up with paper dolls. It also plays very much like a video game (taking on the role of a character, fighting monsters, and leveling up!) There is even an epic boss fight at the end in which all players must work together to triumph! But only one of you will be crowned the Champion Chibi!Oh, you mean besides monsters? 
6 different Characters, with boy/girl versions of each one! So 12 different Chibi's to choose from!!!
30 Chunky Battle Dice!
A BIG stack of fierce (and sometimes cute) monster cards!
Treasure!
120 equipment cards with cool weapons, special powers, head gear, foot gear, chest plates, mounts and more!
1 minute timer
Damage tokens

We have hope, and strongly believe, that you will enjoy what you see below. Your support is very important for us. While we see that our products are still needed we will run future releases. So thank you in advance to give us that possibility.  What our process look like:1. 3D sculpt 1b. 3D sculpt of alternative options (as stretched goal) 2. Printing than casting resin models 3. Professional painting (as special option) All 3D sculpts has already been made. We need your help to invest in production molds and materials. Also stretch goals will help us raise finds to make some alternative versions and options for our miniatures, which for sure you will also like as base versions. We would like you to contribute during the development with your ideas. Please send emails (hiddendreamsminiatures@gmail.com), make comments here or post on Facebook, telling us any suggestions you may have. Your ideas will be base of mentioned before alternative options. Some of them we noticed during the development process but there is still a chance to integrate yours. You will feel that your ideas are coming alive.As mentioned in the process example, for those of you that don't particularly enjoy painting miniatures and view it more as a chore that needs to be done, Hidden Dreams will also paint your miniatures with a color scheme of your choice and send you the finished models.One last thing: the delivery times are an approximation. Everything should be delivered in time, but some things could be delayed, while others could be faster. The delivery times are flexible at this point and will be changed based on the demand for specific miniatures. We will do our best to provide them at least in May 2017 and this is a very real date. So if you like the look of the miniatures below, please support us, so we can create them for you. If you know someone who might be interested, tell him/her about this crowdfunding campaign. Visit and like our Facebook page and please spread the word wherever you can.And last but not least we would like to thank everyone who supports our company.

<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528280501/v6pwzat1uxvrsx9pvmda.png"" src=""""/></h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Vanguard d100</strong> is a set of role playing game rules and mechanics, which allow the players and Game Masters alike to play in just about any fantasy setting. Its potential lies in the introduction of game mechanics that allow an enormous freedom when it comes to creating and improving characters, rather than forcing players to wait dozens of game sessions before they can do so. No more ‘waiting months before leveling up’ or having to ‘end a story arc before gaining experience points’, sometimes only to get a small or an insignificant benefit.</p>
<p>It also gives great freedom when creating campaign settings, allowing you to remove certain sections and chapters without breaking game balance. For example, you could play a gritty historical campaign where magic has no place in the world and also without other fantasy inspired races. And if you want to play a “pirate inspired” campaign, you can find rules for early firearms as well!</p>
<p>In addition, the game's combat system is built around a system of quick turns which makes the gameplay extremely fast and fun.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The game itself is ready and this campaign is meant to help funding the costs of editing, proofreading and obviously to pay for the artwork. The more money it collects, the more it goes towards making it better and perhaps even expand it with rules for modern and sci-fi settings!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2>What is Vanguard d100 exactly?</h2>
<p><strong>Vanguard d100</strong> is a role-playing game system that uses the d100 dice. Unlike many other, you don't try to roll 'under' a value, instead you use the easy-to-understand-and-handle rules of adding a modifier to your dice result and trying to beat a 'difficulty number' in order to succeed on your task. It has no classes, no levels and provides a set of rules that allow you to build your own spells.</p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h3>A role playing game</h3>
<p>In this type of game, players work together with the Game Master to create a story. The Game Master controls the world and all other characters while each player controls his or her own character and acts according to his or her interpretation of that character's personality. All players can work together or have hidden agendas.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528282231/etdkfbmhkpvkyoge9x0p.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>As for the Game Master (GM), his or her job is to act as a referee and decide how the world and its characters/creatures react to the player's actions. The GM is the master, controlling the game flow to some extent and even deciding when, where and how rules apply or don't. If something doesn't fit the GM's vision, then that must be changed or removed.</p>
<p>Together with the players, the rules and the common sense, an adventure will be created which can last for many game sessions or just a few. <u>In the end, the goal of the game is for everyone to have fun</u>.</p>
<p>Neither the players nor the GM are forced to memorize the rules to play this game. Understanding the basics is more than enough to start playing, while using the rulebook as a reference tool during the game, to check things you don’t know.</p>
</div>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Fantasy oriented rules</h3>
<p>For the moment, <strong>Vanguard d100</strong> covers only rules that can be used in fantasy or historical settings. The game includes many important features such as spells and unique magical items, runes, sigils and so on. All characters can count on several attributes and skills as their core abilities. Talents and equipment make up the rest.</p>
<p>In its pages you will find information about 16 different races! Unlike many other games of the genre, it includes several 'uncommon' races in its core rulebook, such as ogres and centaurs, which are balanced with all others.</p>
<p>The rules themselves are easy to understand: roll a d100 dice, add modifiers and compare the result with the number 100. If your total result is higher, you succeed in the task, otherwise you fail. However, there are degrees of failure and success, so be careful when attempting a task in which your character is weaker!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528282923/pm6fhpxfhd3ylgneniex.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The rules cover many details like illumination and visibility, losing body parts, and even <u>sanity</u> for the lovers of horror-heavy campaigns! But as the GM you can skip many of the secondary rules and sections and use your best judgement. The core rules are simple.</p>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>No classes, no character levels</h3>
<p>While classes and levels are an easy way to handle character progression, they are also the biggest barrier for character development. In many other RPGs, attempting to build mixed characters would make them very weak. Being a warrior for several levels and then taking a level as a spellcaster would weaken your warrior abilities while providing only a few meager spellcasting abilities (with spells that barely match the current level of the character). To counteract this, the publishers of such games eventually release dozens of other books with many variants in an attempt to provide 'character builds' that still fail to fulfill the needs of many players.</p>
<p>In <strong>Vanguard d100</strong> you don't have to worry about that. Since you only use experience points, you can improve your characters anyway you want to, including mixing 'character roles'. And since you can build your own spells, you can be a skilled warrior and still have decent spells without weakening your character, as you would in the example above.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528282869/hyu9adjcsfajianhxrn9.png"" src=""""/></p>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>Fast and realistic combat</h3>
<p><strong>Vanguard d100</strong> has various details that make the combat fast and more realistic when compared to other roleplaying games. Per turn, all creatures have one normal action, used to either attack, move, use abilities, items, etc, which speeds up the game. But don't worry, there are plenty of options to prevent you from simply spending your turns just moving to hit your enemy (attack while moving, charge, attack multiple opponents, etc). Thus the combat gives the feeling of every turn happening at the same time.</p>
<p>You won't roll many different attacks. Instead, a single attack roll means you attempt to hit as many times as possible, depending on your character's '<i>Attack Speed</i>' (the higher, more re-rolls to hit you get).</p>
<p>Should you hit, you get to roll damage equal to 1d100 plus modifiers. Damage doesn't vary with weapon, instead what varies are statistics like critical hit, attack speed and armor penetration. In addition, every creature's Vitality starts at 100 + modifiers, so without significant increases, each blow has the potential to kill (especially if the blow turns out to be a critical hit or a massive hit that cuts off parts of the body)! Or at least to injure significantly causing the creature to suffer effects from pain. Fortunately, armor and the creature's physical resistance grant it a measure of 'Damage Reduction'.</p>
<p>All this is but a small taste of how combat works in <strong>Vanguard d100</strong>. It requires significant tactical thought as it can be very dangerous. But this also means your attacks are deadlier as well, so you get to dispose of your enemies faster and in greater style!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Build your own spells</h3>
<p>With <strong>Vanguard</strong>, you will be able to build your spells anyway you want them to be. The rulebook presents you with many different spell components and all you have to do is add them together to create your spell. So yes, you could have a starting character capable of creating entire fire-storms over a city.</p>
<p>But with this freedom come great risks! As you create more powerful spells you increase their relative power (Spell Level) making it far more difficult to cast and control. Cast a spell too powerful and things can quickly get out of hand, with the spell backfiring and creating a different effect than intended (many of which can be quite fun, while others extremely harmful even for you). As an option, if you don't want rules for spell backfire, you can opt for a simpler one where spells will simply fail to take effect (also included in the rules).</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528282297/ozxto5l8nnsytp186l06.png"" src=""""/></p>
<div>
<h3>Many more details</h3>
<p>One thing you can count on: this game covers many details. From character advantages and flaws, to backgrounds you can select when creating your character. In many RPGs, age isn't a factor while in <strong>Vanguard d100</strong> it is. Building an older character means more starting XP but less gained during the campaign. It also means more years lived, so more time to spend on many different backgrounds.</p>
<p>You can also find rules for cutting or breaking arms and legs as well as prosthetics, rules for improving weapons and armor without using magic, mechanics to handle 'luck' in your game, sanity rules to break the minds of your characters or simply give them access to incredibly powerful effects, early firearms such as cannons and muskets and so on.</p>
</div>
<p><u>And if you want to create races for your own settings, you can find rules for creating your own races.</u></p>
<div><div> </div></div>
<div>
<h3>Modular Game</h3>
<p><strong>Vanguard</strong> was created to be played in many different game settings, so its rules are generic. They are not tied to a specific world. Thus, you can remove various elements from the game without breaking its balance. For example, you can choose to remove magic completely from your game. </p>
<p>There are more examples, of course. Luck and sanity are completely optional. You can choose to use only certain races, remove specific talents and skills, ignore rules for details like illumination, losing body parts, objects’ hardness, environmental hazards, magical runes, etc.</p>
<p><u>The rules are generic enough that can be used in many existing fantasy settings, with little adaptation.</u></p>
<p> </p>

</div>

<h2>Why use crowdfunding?</h2>
<p>The book itself has more than 350 thousand words and it is estimated to have nearly 550 pages once illustrations are added.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The costs</h3>
<p>Producing a RPG book carries a lot of costs and we are asking for your help and contribution. The campaign has no fixed goal, many of the costs have already been paid in advance. The funding goal is meant to recover some of those costs and cover as much of the rest as possible.</p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of some of the costs involved in this project.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Cover Art:</strong> $ 450.00</li>
<li>
<strong>Logo Design:</strong> $ 150.00</li>
<li>
<strong>Editing and Proofreading:</strong> $ 2,200.00</li>
<li>
<strong>Interior Artwork:</strong> estimated around $ 7,500.00</li>
<li>IndieGoGo and Credit Card fees will accrue about 8% of total funding (plus 25 dollars from raising money in dollars to deposit in a Portuguese bank).</li>
</ul>
<div>Obviously, reaching the initial goal won't be enough to cover all of these, since printing and distribution of manuals for backers will be necessary. But those costs will be supported by myself.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>

<h2>Stretch Goals</h2>
<p>As previously stated, this flexible crowdfunding campaign has a main purpose: to cover many of the costs as best as possible, so the final rulebook will be an amazing work. However, there are many other things that can be done with increased funding.</p>
<p><strong>US$ 5,000.00</strong> - If this amount is reached, while not yet enough to cover all the illustration costs, a website will be created for this game. The website will include updates, news, lists of backers and possibly sample characters. In addition, depending on how this game is received, some monsters and enemies will be released for free in the website for everyone to use.</p>
<p><strong>US$ 12,000.00</strong> - Reaching this stretch goal will cover all the estimated costs to release an amazing rulebook and the rest <u>will be used to create <i>Vanguard d100 Spellcasting App.</i></u> This App will allow you to easily create spells, using the rules from the <strong>Vanguard d100 </strong>rulebook. The app will be freely distributed for all those with the 'Knight' pledge or higher.</p>
<p><strong>US$ 14,000.00</strong> - Several monsters and NPCs will be released in a PDF free for all 'Dragon Hunter', 'Archmage' and 'King' backers. Also, the <i>Vanguard d100 Spellcasting App</i> will be released free for those with the 'Knight' pledge.</p>
<p><strong>US$ 16,000.00</strong> - With this stretch goal, a pre-made adventure will be created and distributed for free via website.</p>
<p><strong>US$ 17,500.00</strong> - A <i>Vanguard d100 Digital Character Sheet</i> will be created if this stretch goal is reached. It will be delivered for free to all backers regardless of pledge level. Also, the <i>Vanguard d100 Spellcasting App</i> will be released free for all backers regardless of pledge.</p>
<p><strong>US$ 22,000.00</strong> - If this stretch goal is unlocked, the <strong>Vanguard d100 Bestiary,</strong> which will include all monsters and NPCs, will be created and released. A PDF of the Bestiary will be delivered free for the 'Dragon Hunter' pledge or higher. All monsters released for free in the website will remain there and a few more will be added.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528282393/clnt3izmuhk3wybsctvk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>US$ 26,000.00</strong> - With this stretch goal, a second pre-made adventure will be created and distributed for free via website.</p>
<p><strong>US$ 30,000.00</strong> - By reaching this goal, large scale warfare will be covered in the <strong>Vanguard d100</strong> rules, in the form of a PDF supplement. It will be distributed free for everyone via the website!</p>
<p><strong>US$ 40,000.00</strong> - <strong>Vanguard d100</strong> is a set of rules that can be used for any fantasy setting. But if this stretch goal is reached, the game will expand to cover rules for 'modern' settings! An entire new book will be created, with its own images and design. It will cover rules for modern vehicles, weapons, computers, modern buildings, sports and so on, and will give you rules to combine magic with the modern world. </p>
<p>A PDF of this ruleset will be delivered free for 'Dragon Hunter' pledge or higher. Creating an entire new set of rules takes time, but I will dedicate my entire time to it, so this ruleset can be released no later than 12/2019.</p>
<p><strong>US$ 60,000.00</strong> - If this stretch goal is reached, <strong>Vanguard d100</strong> will expand to have a sci-fi ruleset! Like the previous stretch goal, an entire new book will be created to cover rules such as cyber-warfare, spaceships, space travel and battles, futuristic weapons, space magic, exploration of strange new worlds, and many other rules!</p>
<p>A PDF of this ruleset will be delivered free for 'Dragon Hunter' pledge or higher. Creating an entire new set of rules takes time, but I will dedicate my entire time to it, so this ruleset can be released no later than 12/2020.</p>

</div>
</div></div>","Vanguard d100 is a set of role playing game rules and mechanics, which allow the players and Game Masters alike to play in just about any fantasy setting. Its potential lies in the introduction of game mechanics that allow an enormous freedom when it comes to creating and improving characters, rather than forcing players to wait dozens of game sessions before they can do so. No more ‘waiting months before leveling up’ or having to ‘end a story arc before gaining experience points’, sometimes only to get a small or an insignificant benefit.
It also gives great freedom when creating campaign settings, allowing you to remove certain sections and chapters without breaking game balance. For example, you could play a gritty historical campaign where magic has no place in the world and also without other fantasy inspired races. And if you want to play a “pirate inspired” campaign, you can find rules for early firearms as well!
In addition, the game's combat system is built around a system of quick turns which makes the gameplay extremely fast and fun.
 
The game itself is ready and this campaign is meant to help funding the costs of editing, proofreading and obviously to pay for the artwork. The more money it collects, the more it goes towards making it better and perhaps even expand it with rules for modern and sci-fi settings!
 

What is Vanguard d100 exactly?
Vanguard d100 is a role-playing game system that uses the d100 dice. Unlike many other, you don't try to roll 'under' a value, instead you use the easy-to-understand-and-handle rules of adding a modifier to your dice result and trying to beat a 'difficulty number' in order to succeed on your task. It has no classes, no levels and provides a set of rules that allow you to build your own spells.
 

A role playing game
In this type of game, players work together with the Game Master to create a story. The Game Master controls the world and all other characters while each player controls his or her own character and acts according to his or her interpretation of that character's personality. All players can work together or have hidden agendas.

As for the Game Master (GM), his or her job is to act as a referee and decide how the world and its characters/creatures react to the player's actions. The GM is the master, controlling the game flow to some extent and even deciding when, where and how rules apply or don't. If something doesn't fit the GM's vision, then that must be changed or removed.
Together with the players, the rules and the common sense, an adventure will be created which can last for many game sessions or just a few. In the end, the goal of the game is for everyone to have fun.
Neither the players nor the GM are forced to memorize the rules to play this game. Understanding the basics is more than enough to start playing, while using the rulebook as a reference tool during the game, to check things you don’t know.

 

Fantasy oriented rules
For the moment, Vanguard d100 covers only rules that can be used in fantasy or historical settings. The game includes many important features such as spells and unique magical items, runes, sigils and so on. All characters can count on several attributes and skills as their core abilities. Talents and equipment make up the rest.
In its pages you will find information about 16 different races! Unlike many other games of the genre, it includes several 'uncommon' races in its core rulebook, such as ogres and centaurs, which are balanced with all others.
The rules themselves are easy to understand: roll a d100 dice, add modifiers and compare the result with the number 100. If your total result is higher, you succeed in the task, otherwise you fail. However, there are degrees of failure and success, so be careful when attempting a task in which your character is weaker!

The rules cover many details like illumination and visibility, losing body parts, and even sanity for the lovers of horror-heavy campaigns! But as the GM you can skip many of the secondary rules and sections and use your best judgement. The core rules are simple.
 

No classes, no character levels
While classes and levels are an easy way to handle character progression, they are also the biggest barrier for character development. In many other RPGs, attempting to build mixed characters would make them very weak. Being a warrior for several levels and then taking a level as a spellcaster would weaken your warrior abilities while providing only a few meager spellcasting abilities (with spells that barely match the current level of the character). To counteract this, the publishers of such games eventually release dozens of other books with many variants in an attempt to provide 'character builds' that still fail to fulfill the needs of many players.
In Vanguard d100 you don't have to worry about that. Since you only use experience points, you can improve your characters anyway you want to, including mixing 'character roles'. And since you can build your own spells, you can be a skilled warrior and still have decent spells without weakening your character, as you would in the example above.

 

Fast and realistic combat
Vanguard d100 has various details that make the combat fast and more realistic when compared to other roleplaying games. Per turn, all creatures have one normal action, used to either attack, move, use abilities, items, etc, which speeds up the game. But don't worry, there are plenty of options to prevent you from simply spending your turns just moving to hit your enemy (attack while moving, charge, attack multiple opponents, etc). Thus the combat gives the feeling of every turn happening at the same time.
You won't roll many different attacks. Instead, a single attack roll means you attempt to hit as many times as possible, depending on your character's 'Attack Speed' (the higher, more re-rolls to hit you get).
Should you hit, you get to roll damage equal to 1d100 plus modifiers. Damage doesn't vary with weapon, instead what varies are statistics like critical hit, attack speed and armor penetration. In addition, every creature's Vitality starts at 100 + modifiers, so without significant increases, each blow has the potential to kill (especially if the blow turns out to be a critical hit or a massive hit that cuts off parts of the body)! Or at least to injure significantly causing the creature to suffer effects from pain. Fortunately, armor and the creature's physical resistance grant it a measure of 'Damage Reduction'.
All this is but a small taste of how combat works in Vanguard d100. It requires significant tactical thought as it can be very dangerous. But this also means your attacks are deadlier as well, so you get to dispose of your enemies faster and in greater style!
 



Build your own spells
With Vanguard, you will be able to build your spells anyway you want them to be. The rulebook presents you with many different spell components and all you have to do is add them together to create your spell. So yes, you could have a starting character capable of creating entire fire-storms over a city.
But with this freedom come great risks! As you create more powerful spells you increase their relative power (Spell Level) making it far more difficult to cast and control. Cast a spell too powerful and things can quickly get out of hand, with the spell backfiring and creating a different effect than intended (many of which can be quite fun, while others extremely harmful even for you). As an option, if you don't want rules for spell backfire, you can opt for a simpler one where spells will simply fail to take effect (also included in the rules).


Many more details
One thing you can count on: this game covers many details. From character advantages and flaws, to backgrounds you can select when creating your character. In many RPGs, age isn't a factor while in Vanguard d100 it is. Building an older character means more starting XP but less gained during the campaign. It also means more years lived, so more time to spend on many different backgrounds.
You can also find rules for cutting or breaking arms and legs as well as prosthetics, rules for improving weapons and armor without using magic, mechanics to handle 'luck' in your game, sanity rules to break the minds of your characters or simply give them access to incredibly powerful effects, early firearms such as cannons and muskets and so on.

And if you want to create races for your own settings, you can find rules for creating your own races.
 

Modular Game
Vanguard was created to be played in many different game settings, so its rules are generic. They are not tied to a specific world. Thus, you can remove various elements from the game without breaking its balance. For example, you can choose to remove magic completely from your game. 
There are more examples, of course. Luck and sanity are completely optional. You can choose to use only certain races, remove specific talents and skills, ignore rules for details like illumination, losing body parts, objects’ hardness, environmental hazards, magical runes, etc.
The rules are generic enough that can be used in many existing fantasy settings, with little adaptation.
 



Why use crowdfunding?
The book itself has more than 350 thousand words and it is estimated to have nearly 550 pages once illustrations are added.
 
The costs
Producing a RPG book carries a lot of costs and we are asking for your help and contribution. The campaign has no fixed goal, many of the costs have already been paid in advance. The funding goal is meant to recover some of those costs and cover as much of the rest as possible.
Here's a breakdown of some of the costs involved in this project.


Cover Art: $ 450.00

Logo Design: $ 150.00

Editing and Proofreading: $ 2,200.00

Interior Artwork: estimated around $ 7,500.00
IndieGoGo and Credit Card fees will accrue about 8% of total funding (plus 25 dollars from raising money in dollars to deposit in a Portuguese bank).

Obviously, reaching the initial goal won't be enough to cover all of these, since printing and distribution of manuals for backers will be necessary. But those costs will be supported by myself.
 
 

Pledge benefits
This crowdfunding campaign has many different pledges, all of which (including the smallest 1$ pledge) include benefits. All of them, including the 'rookie' pledge will give you a high-resolution print of the Vanguard d100 rulebook cover, created by Pedro I.

<p>Every listed Backer quantity reached unlocks another unique creature into the compendium with draft level art. Every Funding level reached unlocks a Unique Creature and adds full-color art to one of the unlocked Creatures.</p>
<p>Whenever we reach one of these goals, the first person to announce it in the public comments, chooses which creature to unlock. If you are first to report it, choose a number to be unveiled. If I report it, I will generate a random number.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I know this year has been difficult financially, and not everyone can contribute in that way, but your interest is enough and joining us online at Discord, Facebook, Twitter, &amp; Instagram sharing your excitement for the project and forming a community developing art and concepts is what I would really love to see.<br/><br/>Also, Indiegogo provides tools to share the campaign to social media, so if you want to be a part please consider sharing what makes you excited about the coming of After!!</p>
</div></div>","Let the Stretch Goals Continue!!​
Every listed Backer quantity reached unlocks another unique creature into the compendium with draft level art. Every Funding level reached unlocks a Unique Creature and adds full-color art to one of the unlocked Creatures.
Whenever we reach one of these goals, the first person to announce it in the public comments, chooses which creature to unlock. If you are first to report it, choose a number to be unveiled. If I report it, I will generate a random number.

 
See the original campaign HERE:



​Leave your Mark! - Leave your signature, logo, or personal mark in the pages of After. The people that fund our projects in the year 2020 have the opportunity to forever be marked in its pages.
There are 2 PDFs being created that you will have access to as perks, After 5e Scavenger's guide & After 5e Compendium. 

The main perk and the goal of our 2020 Campaign is the production of a Limited Edition After 5e 2020 Core Book.
Additionally, there is a quick adventure called The Scavenglands that you are eligible to receive.

This is the beginning of After, which is a sandbox waiting to be filled with various art to express the world that spans from the horrific and grotesque to the beautiful and serene. Keeping this project manageable while also providing a quick turn around with low-cost shipping was a HUGE goal, so I am only offering media items that are 90% completed.

This item will increase in size as new creatures, and other contents are unlocked through stretch goals and follow-up campaigns until it is ready to become a printable book on its own. 
By selecting a pledge offering this item, you are eligible for FREE PDF UPDATES as new versions are released until this item is finalized in print.

The Genesis System allows for diverse character development. You may even select multiple backgrounds because everything is negotiable using Genesis Points, enabling the GM to say, ""Yes! For the right amount of Genesis Points, you may start your character the way you wish!""


Not every characteristic of your in-game character needs to cost Genesis Points. One of the most important choices is how your character looks and acts. If you utilize the mutation system, a player character may look any way the GM allows. It is not until a characteristic effects gameplay that Genesis Points will need to be involved.
While on the topic of mutations, each mutation changes based on the stage selected. No matter what stage the mutation is at, it is highly likely it scales with level as your character becomes more in tune with their abilities, making the mutation a real part of character development.

If you find all of the pages, you can open a portal to banish the Kandarian Demons and win the game.

                             Created in 2006, Space Goat Productions has decades of combined experience producing comic books, TV, animation, video games, commercial art, and concept design. This past year, Space Goat began production on board games for both the Evil Dead and Terminator franchises, and has since acquired The Howling along with a few other top secret licenses soon to be announced. Space Goat has transformed from the industry's premier service provider, to a highly successful comic book and board game publisher. Some of the top game and horror press outlets like Comic Book Resources, Deadites Online, HorrorFuel, iHorror, Bloody Disgusting, Popcorn Horror and MovieWeb have covered the game, and here's what other press has had to say about it:""Our dream of giving deadite scum a fistful of boomstick from the comfort of our own living rooms is about to come a reality."" - Dread Central""An 'Evil Dead 2' card game is coming—and it looks super groovy"" - The Daily Dot""...an official tile and figure based survival game that every Evil Dead fan is going to want to own."" -GoresTruly""Much like a more bad-ass, interactive version of Clue.."" - Wicked Horror""[With} the idea that the players are working together but they can turn against their friends and you have an interesting concept for a game"" - Beasts of War""Smells like a cash-in."" -Some guy on Reddit""As unappealing as any form of game is to me at this point in life, I’d jump at the opportunity to pick this one up...I’m certain a great deal of genre fans would strangle a Deadite to get their hands on this beauty!"" - HorrorFreak News ""Here’s one that, I’m sure, will get a lot of people going, 'Oh, I’m soooooo going to be backing that!!'"" - Tabletop Gaming News""[It] looks like it will be a frightening twist on family game night."" - Daily DeadHere's a listicle from our boss you can read and share around social media.Shipping will be charged after the Indiegogo Campaign ends based on actual shipping costs and is collected via Backerkit. This allows us to charge shipping fairly for all backers and avoid a 'one size fits all' mentality to shipping. Below are shipping estimates for the core game (estimated to be around 3lbs). These are just estimates. Costs may rise due to weight increase as more items are unlocked via stretch goals and add-on purchases you choose. This will be calculated by Backerkit after backer surveys are turned in.

<p>MourneQuest will be manufactured in China, with one of Backspindle Games' long-term production partners, ensuring the highest quality of game components. The most complex components are the miniatures. Poducing quality miniatures is a long process, which will require us to approve samples and then check the final production quality. Estimated production start date is about 3-4 weeks after the campaign ends and the lead time for most components is 90 days. The custom dice, miniatures and all deluxe edition components may add up to 25 extra days, but we're confident that final delivery time will not be affected.</p>
<p>We plan to have copies for UK Games Expo 2019, so the turnaround on this will be as fast as we can manage.</p>

So, its best to gather the Charms required to cast them out before they come after you.The dreaded Shimnavore, trapped within the Silver Orb, bound by the Mighty Mourne Wall is stirring. It calls to all manner of evil nightmares to aid in its escape. The Elderfolk wizards are long gone, so it’s up to young Jack Turner and a few friends of the Hawksbeard Clan to stop them. But time is not on their side, evil magic is being used against them and their skills are untested against such formidable enemies.Can they release the Nightmares, defeat the Shimnavore and save the Mourne Wall before it’s too late?All combat in MourneQuest is resolved with a single dice roll. There are four levels of Combat dice. Players add the dice results, together any extras from equipment, to their chosen ability level for each fight, (either Courage, Strength or Magic). They must equal or better their opponent's ability level which can vary depending on the current phase of the Moon to win. Relics can give heroes additional power or abilities to increase their chances in battle.
MourneQuest will be manufactured in China, with one of Backspindle Games' long-term production partners, ensuring the highest quality of game components. The most complex components are the miniatures. Poducing quality miniatures is a long process, which will require us to approve samples and then check the final production quality. Estimated production start date is about 3-4 weeks after the campaign ends and the lead time for most components is 90 days. The custom dice, miniatures and all deluxe edition components may add up to 25 extra days, but we're confident that final delivery time will not be affected.
We plan to have copies for UK Games Expo 2019, so the turnaround on this will be as fast as we can manage.",21.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p><i><strong>Book of Taverns One: The Trireme </strong>and <strong>Vain Robert's Gibbet</strong></i></p>
<p>Your heroes are going to be stopping at a tavern sometime, right? All adventurers need a drink some time, and with this book it's not hard to turn a pint of the local ale into a memorable gaming experience! <i><strong>Book of Taverns One</strong></i>  gives you a choice of two exciting places to stay the night, find adventure, and (let's face it) probably burn the place down. That's why we include two of them - one's a burn-down, and the other one is for hiding from the city watch. Both of these taverns offer NPCs for the characters to interact with (or slay), a diverting history, and convenient descriptions, as well as adventure hooks that will be so irresistible to the greedy characters that the clerics and paladins will have no choice in the matter.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>The Trireme</strong></i> (11 pages, color cover, color interior) by Chris Jones presents a quiet tavern just outside of town, dedicated to philosophical debates, epicurean delights, and a private drinking room. Local philosophers are welcomed here as long as they can pay their tab, and visitors to the tavern can expect to be embroiled in some lively debate as to the nature of the world and the soul. Try the pecan cakes, but save some money for the extensive wine list. Or burn the place down - it's always an option.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>Vain Robert's Gibbet</strong></i> (11 pages, color cover, color interior) by Chris Jones is a scurvy dive bar on the docks. Those passing by usually speed their steps, for only the lowest class of sailors stop in for a drink here. The tavern keeper doesn't mind at all, since Vain Robert's Gibbet is only the front for a coven of elite seafarers who battle a growing evil out in the depths of the sea. Note: this one would be more dangerous to burn down.</p>

<h3>The Project </h3>
<p>Necromancer Games is continuing the use of this INDIEGOGO with The Book of Taverns: Volume One. Necromancer Games projects on Indiegogo are simple, focused, and short, designed for easy, flexible use at the game table.</p>
<p>Thus, INDIEGOGO projects by Necromancer Games will-</p>
<ul>
<li>Be short in duration</li>
<li>Be limited to a single title</li>
<li>Have options priced between $5-$30</li>
<li>Designed so that all stretch goals and project bonuses affect the principle reward ONLY (usually both the PDF and the softcover).</li>
<li>Be the only guaranteed method to get the premium* print copy (NOTE: the softcover versions  in this printing will not be sold on our website: see FAQ for explanation).</li>
<li>Have simple fulfillment process that does not use Backerkit</li>
</ul>
<p>*Premium means heavyweight glossy interior pages enhancing the art and color elements. The  thick, glossy cardstock brings out the vibrant color in the cover illustrations. These are the nicest softcover books we have ever sold and we only print a title this way once.</p>
<p>Any reprint would use print on demand service that, although nice, do not approach the quality of our INDIEGOGO funded books.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why the Tiny Print Run?</h3>
<p>Since 2012, our crowdfunding approach has been extravagant in every way. Ambitious, with massive page counts, numerous add-on options, and plentiful stretch goals. Many of these supported primary titles with as many as 990 pages.</p>
<p>This has resulted in Kickstarters with memorable pledge rewards that include top-quality hardcover books, often with dozens of stretch goal bonuses and add-on extras. These are awesome, BUT ... they are expensive to buy for customers like you because they are very expensive to make for publishers like us.</p>
<p><strong>Why not use Kickstarter?</strong></p>
<p>We still use Kickstarter for our large-scale projects. Smaller projects like this one are happening in response to feedback we've gotten from fans like you. We hear the request for less-expensive options for our projects and products all the time. Another thing people have asked for at conventions, on social media and in email, is for a larger selection of smaller, faster-paced adventures that can be completed in 2-3 sessions and not require long time commitments.</p>
<p>Additionally, Necromancer Games has grown in both sales and brand awareness.  This opportunity will give us the additional resources to invest in the very best books in all of our formats. </p>
<p><strong>Product enhancements tied to project success </strong></p>
<p>During the 14 day primary project period for The Book of Taverns: Volume One and after the $1000 goal is met we will  improve the delivered product. There are no special tiered collectors editions or add-on purchase extras. Thus, as total project funding increases the better the final product will be for everybody.</p>
<p><strong>Examples of improvements or additional content increased funding would bring to <i>The Book of Taverns: Volume One</i></strong><i> -</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Additional commissions for interior color art specific to the adventure. </li>
<li>The previous Indiegogo project added 2 interior art pieces and 3 extra creature illustrations for its appendix.</li>
<li>Printed Player map(s)/Insert. This is one we would love to do but it would require a substantial increase in overall project funding.</li>
<li>Downloadable Options designed for popular virtual table-top software (The rewards for both How Orcus Stole Christmas! and In Vino Gigantus included the new creature/NPC tokens and player maps). </li>
<li>High-resolution files of illustrations to share with players at the table.</li>

<p>Softcover perks will be mailed to the address provided by us via Indiegogo. </p>

<h3>Overseas Shipping</h3>
<p>NOTE TO INTERNATIONAL BACKERS: Shipping international has become very expensive. We understand this. Likewise, some countries charge VAT tax or other fees to our customers on receipt. We cannot fraudulently lie about the value of materials we mail out. We are happy to ship you anything regardless of where you live, but we have to stay in business at the same time thus even our lightest books are affected. In the near future we expect to have a print on demand system in place for everyone overseas, It is not ideal, as the final book is not printed at the highest-quality when compared to the ones we fulfill in Indiegogo.</p>

<h3><strong>Welcome to Dark Fable Miniatures Legend of Cleopatra Indiegogo campaign!</strong></h3>
<p>We have put together an exciting new selection of 12 sets of miniatures from the court of Cleopatra VII, the most famous of all the queens of ancient Egypt.  Cleopatra has long been the subject of fascination and is portrayed in countless films, plays, books and works of art.   Her name alone evokes the archetypal image of a beautiful and exotic queen surrounded by servants, slaves, courtiers and every extravagance that the mind can conjure.  The real Cleopatra is just as intriguing, perhaps even more so.  Her family was descended from Ptolemy, a Macedonian general who had served Alexander the Great and seized Egypt 300 years earlier.  Aside from her legendary beauty Cleopatra was an astute politician and extremely cultured and intelligent, she was fluent in seven languages and the first of her dynasty that could actually speak Egyptian.  Cleopatra was also brave, resourceful and unflinchingly ruthless when necessary.  Her rise to control Egypt was after a bloody dynastic struggle against her own brother and sister, who both met untimely ends . . . We felt that it was long overdue that such a legendary queen be added to our range of miniatures.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492434192/z4ciqjbegftqgwsnyefa.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The Legend of Cleopatra is Dark Fable miniature's 6th Indiegogo campaign - the concept and design of the miniatures are drawn from a number of sources, archaeology, history, Hollywood films and fantasy fiction.  Our Cleopatra miniature is based on the glamorous Egyptian costumes worn by Elizabeth Taylor in the 1964 Hollywood film, Cleopatra.  John Winter did a magnificent job on this model which captures the regal bearing and charismatic personality of the legendary queen.  We are also producing five sets of Ptolemaic Egyptian soldiers (2 sets of unarmoured, 2 sets of armoured and 1 command set) which are based on archaeological evidence and tomb paintings.  The Ptolemaic army of Cleopatra's time during the late 1st century BC was heavily influenced by the Romans and David Soderquist is doing a fantastic job of sculpting their equipment and attire accurately.  We have also included some beasts and monsters to liven up your collection.  A set of hungry lions and a pair of fearsome sphinxes from Egyptian mythology which have been expertly sculpted by Andy Pieper.  Brother Vinni has produced a lovely set of Egyptian and Nubian ladies of court which will make excellent additions to Cleopatra's entourage.  Finally, we have a set of miniatures which is a hold over from our previous Temple of Set campaign.  A trio of sinister cultist guards made by the master of wickedness himself, Kev Adams!</p>
<p>We have some fantastic and reasonably priced perks on offer as well as some great EARLY BIRD specials for those who pledge right away.  To make this project even more tempting we have a number of cool stretch goal rewards which if unlocked, will make your perks even more of a bargain.  I have also made the entire Dark Fable Egyptian range, which was produced in previous Indiegogos, available as add-ons.  Our biggest selling point is the quality of the miniatures themselves sculpted by some of the best talents in the industry, David Soderquist, John Winter, Kev Adams, Andy Pieper and Brother Vinni.  These high-quality 28mm miniatures are made from a lead-free pewter alloy and have an incredible amount of detail and personality. Whether you are a collector or gamer you are certain to enjoy these figures!  Please check out the gallery for more images!</p>

<p><strong>There are a variety of perks to suit every budget, which range in price from $15 to $330.  Each perk allows you to choose from the 12 sets of the Cleopatra miniatures on offer and any of the $11 add-on sets which were released during our previous Indiegogo campaigns.  The miniatures are unpainted and most come with plastic slotta bases.</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>What scale are these miniatures and what are they made of?</strong></li></ul>
<p>Most of our miniatures are 28-30mm tall, measuring from the base of the foot to the eye.  Because we use a number of different sculptors there may be a degree of variation between sets of figures.  The miniatures are made from a lead-free pewter alloy and are expertly spin cast by Griffin Moulds here in England.</p>
<ul><li><strong>How much is postage?</strong></li></ul>
<p>Postage will be added to your perk during checkout and is based on your location.  Please contact me regarding rates.</p>
<ul><li><strong>When can I expect to get my miniatures?</strong></li></ul>
<p>I am hoping to be able to start mailing out orders by July 2017.  The first two master moulds have already been made as well as several production moulds which should allow me to get the miniatures cast relatively quickly.  If there are any delays I will be sure to let you all know exactly what is going on and how long it might take.</p>
<ul><li><strong>How do I let you know which packs I have chosen for my perk?</strong></li></ul>
<p>You can either send me a message through the Indiegogo site or an email with your selections.  You can do this right away if you know which sets you want, or you can wait until the end of the campaign and also select from any stretch goals which have been unlocked.</p>
<ul><li><strong>I want to increase my perk level, how do I do this?</strong></li></ul>
<p>Indiegogo does not have an application which enables you to do this yourself.  If you wish to increase your perk level make an additional contribution for the amount which is the difference between the two perks.  For example if you contributed $150 for the level 6 perk and decided you wanted to get the level 7 perk which is $172 you would contribute an additional $22.  You will then need to send me a message about your perk upgrade.</p>
<p><strong>If you have any questions about any aspect of the campaign please send me a message and I will do my best to answer you.</strong></p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p><strong>There are relatively few risks in this campaign.  Most of the miniatures have either been sculpted already or are very close to being finished off.  Two master moulds have already been made as well as a few production moulds.  Dark Fable has previously run five other Indiegogo campaigns all of which were successfully funded and fulfilled.  If there are any issues or unforeseen delays (they do happen on occasion!) I will keep you all informed of what is happening and do my best to sort them out as quickly as possible.  </strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p><strong>Queen Cleopatra has sent messengers far and wide to spread the word of this mighty project, but you too can help!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ask friends, gaming associates, minions and anyone you think might be interested in these excellent miniatures from ancient Egypt to get the word out.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can put a link to this campaign on your blog, forum or website.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools!</strong></p>
</div></div>","Welcome to Dark Fable Miniatures Legend of Cleopatra Indiegogo campaign!
We have put together an exciting new selection of 12 sets of miniatures from the court of Cleopatra VII, the most famous of all the queens of ancient Egypt.  Cleopatra has long been the subject of fascination and is portrayed in countless films, plays, books and works of art.   Her name alone evokes the archetypal image of a beautiful and exotic queen surrounded by servants, slaves, courtiers and every extravagance that the mind can conjure.  The real Cleopatra is just as intriguing, perhaps even more so.  Her family was descended from Ptolemy, a Macedonian general who had served Alexander the Great and seized Egypt 300 years earlier.  Aside from her legendary beauty Cleopatra was an astute politician and extremely cultured and intelligent, she was fluent in seven languages and the first of her dynasty that could actually speak Egyptian.  Cleopatra was also brave, resourceful and unflinchingly ruthless when necessary.  Her rise to control Egypt was after a bloody dynastic struggle against her own brother and sister, who both met untimely ends . . . We felt that it was long overdue that such a legendary queen be added to our range of miniatures.

The Legend of Cleopatra is Dark Fable miniature's 6th Indiegogo campaign - the concept and design of the miniatures are drawn from a number of sources, archaeology, history, Hollywood films and fantasy fiction.  Our Cleopatra miniature is based on the glamorous Egyptian costumes worn by Elizabeth Taylor in the 1964 Hollywood film, Cleopatra.  John Winter did a magnificent job on this model which captures the regal bearing and charismatic personality of the legendary queen.  We are also producing five sets of Ptolemaic Egyptian soldiers (2 sets of unarmoured, 2 sets of armoured and 1 command set) which are based on archaeological evidence and tomb paintings.  The Ptolemaic army of Cleopatra's time during the late 1st century BC was heavily influenced by the Romans and David Soderquist is doing a fantastic job of sculpting their equipment and attire accurately.  We have also included some beasts and monsters to liven up your collection.  A set of hungry lions and a pair of fearsome sphinxes from Egyptian mythology which have been expertly sculpted by Andy Pieper.  Brother Vinni has produced a lovely set of Egyptian and Nubian ladies of court which will make excellent additions to Cleopatra's entourage.  Finally, we have a set of miniatures which is a hold over from our previous Temple of Set campaign.  A trio of sinister cultist guards made by the master of wickedness himself, Kev Adams!
We have some fantastic and reasonably priced perks on offer as well as some great EARLY BIRD specials for those who pledge right away.  To make this project even more tempting we have a number of cool stretch goal rewards which if unlocked, will make your perks even more of a bargain.  I have also made the entire Dark Fable Egyptian range, which was produced in previous Indiegogos, available as add-ons.  Our biggest selling point is the quality of the miniatures themselves sculpted by some of the best talents in the industry, David Soderquist, John Winter, Kev Adams, Andy Pieper and Brother Vinni.  These high-quality 28mm miniatures are made from a lead-free pewter alloy and have an incredible amount of detail and personality. Whether you are a collector or gamer you are certain to enjoy these figures!  Please check out the gallery for more images!
 



There are a variety of perks to suit every budget, which range in price from $15 to $330.  Each perk allows you to choose from the 12 sets of the Cleopatra miniatures on offer and any of the $11 add-on sets which were released during our previous Indiegogo campaigns.  The miniatures are unpainted and most come with plastic slotta bases.
What scale are these miniatures and what are they made of?
Most of our miniatures are 28-30mm tall, measuring from the base of the foot to the eye.  Because we use a number of different sculptors there may be a degree of variation between sets of figures.  The miniatures are made from a lead-free pewter alloy and are expertly spin cast by Griffin Moulds here in England.
How much is postage?
Postage will be added to your perk during checkout and is based on your location.  Please contact me regarding rates.
When can I expect to get my miniatures?
I am hoping to be able to start mailing out orders by July 2017.  The first two master moulds have already been made as well as several production moulds which should allow me to get the miniatures cast relatively quickly.  If there are any delays I will be sure to let you all know exactly what is going on and how long it might take.
How do I let you know which packs I have chosen for my perk?
You can either send me a message through the Indiegogo site or an email with your selections.  You can do this right away if you know which sets you want, or you can wait until the end of the campaign and also select from any stretch goals which have been unlocked.
I want to increase my perk level, how do I do this?
Indiegogo does not have an application which enables you to do this yourself.  If you wish to increase your perk level make an additional contribution for the amount which is the difference between the two perks.  For example if you contributed $150 for the level 6 perk and decided you wanted to get the level 7 perk which is $172 you would contribute an additional $22.  You will then need to send me a message about your perk upgrade.
If you have any questions about any aspect of the campaign please send me a message and I will do my best to answer you.

Risks & Challenges
There are relatively few risks in this campaign.  Most of the miniatures have either been sculpted already or are very close to being finished off.  Two master moulds have already been made as well as a few production moulds.  Dark Fable has previously run five other Indiegogo campaigns all of which were successfully funded and fulfilled.  If there are any issues or unforeseen delays (they do happen on occasion!) I will keep you all informed of what is happening and do my best to sort them out as quickly as possible.  

Other Ways You Can Help
Queen Cleopatra has sent messengers far and wide to spread the word of this mighty project, but you too can help!
Ask friends, gaming associates, minions and anyone you think might be interested in these excellent miniatures from ancient Egypt to get the word out.
You can put a link to this campaign on your blog, forum or website.
Remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools!",95.0,0,"9 Campaigns

<p>What happens when video game playing, comic reading, cartoon watching brothers like Alex and I (Tony) get bored? <br/><br/>We invent.</p>
<p>In this case we were actually trying to play with our old Pokemon cards we found in an old Pokemon binder in the basement. When we struggled to understand the complexities of the game (which is why we only really collected them instead of played with them). We decided to make our own card game.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The scoring had to be easy, we didn't want a calculator to figure out how many health points we had left, and the attacks had to be fun. We introduced a simple coin flip to shake up the game by adding chance to the attack your character would deal. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>For the characters, we had loads of characters and unvierses we created on one of our ""sit down with no electronics and just write/draw"" days.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We tested it out with our family, then with our friends, and noticed everyone was having just as much fun - especially when alliances would naturally form and break throughout the course of the game. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>After some beta-testing we finally got it down and created a free app that would allow you to not only track the health of up to six characters per app, but also read character bios and highlight the characters you have. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We even found out that Shranks is an awesome drinking game to play with your buddies as well!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now we want to release the Starter Pack to the public so everyone else can have fun with this game we created.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We're using IndieGoGo as the platform to allow you to pre-order the game so we can have the game manufactured and shipped to you!</p>

<p>A civilization long gone, a comet heading for Earth, a multiverse of heroes and villains. This is the story of Shranks.</p>
<h3>Birth of the Multiverse</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559048443/rxq6o9l30pceeaj43jk2.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>65 million years ago a comet hit the Earth. This comet was fueled with all the positive energy of the universe.</p>
<p>The force of the comet’s strike caused the Earth to shift at a different frequency then it normally would.</p>
<p>This shift in frequency caused the universe to create more universes in order to keep Earth from being destroyed. Now there are parallel Earths shifting at different frequencies in what is called the multiverse.</p>
<h3>The Lak’ech Ala K’in Tribe</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559213960/ijrpc8ic05jwibiymaym.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>A long lost tribe found the comet and had been using it in their ceremonies.</p>
<p>To avoid fueling the comet with negative energy they exiled tribe members that displayed any emotions that had a negative vibration to it.</p>
<p>After a battle with the exiled members the whole tribe vanished without a trace.</p>
<h3>The Destruction of the Multiverse</h3>

<p>A second comet has been activated, this time filled with the negative energy of the multiverse and a promise of destruction instead of creation. Using the negative energy, Shranks birthed a meteor to prepare his arrival in each multiverse.</p>
<p>If the comet is not stopped it will destroy the multiverse.</p>

<li>Flip a coin to determine what action will be used</li>
<li>You can use your items during your turn – after which the items will be dispensed</li>
<li>To see what effect your item card will have you need to flip a coin</li>

</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","What happens when video game playing, comic reading, cartoon watching brothers like Alex and I (Tony) get bored? We invent.
In this case we were actually trying to play with our old Pokemon cards we found in an old Pokemon binder in the basement. When we struggled to understand the complexities of the game (which is why we only really collected them instead of played with them). We decided to make our own card game.
 
The scoring had to be easy, we didn't want a calculator to figure out how many health points we had left, and the attacks had to be fun. We introduced a simple coin flip to shake up the game by adding chance to the attack your character would deal. 
 
For the characters, we had loads of characters and unvierses we created on one of our ""sit down with no electronics and just write/draw"" days.  
 
We tested it out with our family, then with our friends, and noticed everyone was having just as much fun - especially when alliances would naturally form and break throughout the course of the game. 
 
After some beta-testing we finally got it down and created a free app that would allow you to not only track the health of up to six characters per app, but also read character bios and highlight the characters you have. 
 
We even found out that Shranks is an awesome drinking game to play with your buddies as well!
 
Now we want to release the Starter Pack to the public so everyone else can have fun with this game we created.
 
We're using IndieGoGo as the platform to allow you to pre-order the game so we can have the game manufactured and shipped to you!
 

 



A civilization long gone, a comet heading for Earth, a multiverse of heroes and villains. This is the story of Shranks.
Birth of the Multiverse

65 million years ago a comet hit the Earth. This comet was fueled with all the positive energy of the universe.
The force of the comet’s strike caused the Earth to shift at a different frequency then it normally would.
This shift in frequency caused the universe to create more universes in order to keep Earth from being destroyed. Now there are parallel Earths shifting at different frequencies in what is called the multiverse.
The Lak’ech Ala K’in Tribe

A long lost tribe found the comet and had been using it in their ceremonies.
To avoid fueling the comet with negative energy they exiled tribe members that displayed any emotions that had a negative vibration to it.
After a battle with the exiled members the whole tribe vanished without a trace.
The Destruction of the Multiverse

A second comet has been activated, this time filled with the negative energy of the multiverse and a promise of destruction instead of creation. Using the negative energy, Shranks birthed a meteor to prepare his arrival in each multiverse.
If the comet is not stopped it will destroy the multiverse.
Create Your Team and Save The Multiverse!

Whose team will save the multiverse?
All of the characters in your deck have been sent to the mysterious Quantum Superposition, a land between universes, and only one team can use the original meteor to defeat Shranks.
To obtain the original meteor you must create your team of heroes and villains from across the multiverse to battle your opponents. With the meteor you can put a stop to Shranks and save the multiverse!
 




Discover how easy it is to play Shranks! Learn the rules in a matter of 7 minutes or read the rules in these quick bullet points:

HOWEVER, the campaign does NOT stop there - the more we raise, the more amazing the project becomes...  I aim to one day see BRAINBO! At number one on Amazon, or front row at Toys 'R' Us. Let's do this!Imagine you are asked identify the colour of the word 'BLUE' when it is printed in orange ink.. Well that brain-twister is the key to BRAINBO!'s game mechanic. BRAINBO! is a matching type game, whereby the card on the table must be matched by cards in players' hands, but the methods in BRAINBO! use the Stroop effect to trick the brain.As soon as the dealer turns over the first card from the take pile, play begins! Depending on the mode, players must lay down (whenever they want – there's no 'turns' in BRAINBO!) a card that matches the visible card according to the mode (COLOUR or WORD). Sounds easy? Well, wait until that mode changes during the game...players have to rearrange the brain furniture in order to switch to the reverse method of matching. Special cards spice things up too...
 In the box :
64 colour cards (from 8 different colours)
12 special cards (6 'BRAINBO!' & 6 'CARTE BLANCHE' jokers)
1 mode card (WORD / COLOUR)
Full colour game instructions
Early contributor cards showing the names of first-round investors.
UPDATE! : In the rules, you will discover that there is special version of BRAINBO! included for those moments when you are only two : BRAINBO! BATTLE. In this mind-frazzling modern update of Snap, there are four different ways of 'snapping' ; mistakes are easy to make, and the speed of play means a real grey-matter workout! See the video here : https://youtu.be/S9Ili9gbLOwHaving three young children  has helped immensley in understanding gameplay and refining the design and rules of BRAINBO! Loads of testers have been essential in honing the gameplay  - thank you friends, colleagues and family!The BRAINBO! Development Support Team : Ingrid Giraud (Marketing & Communication Manager), Prof. Jan Lepoutre phD (gameplay mechanics, statistical and theory analysis), and Christen Clark (Media Direction). If you are new to the concept of crowdfunding and kickstarter / IndieGogo, then the first thing to understand is that this is not a charity campaign (like me running a 10K) – you are actually purchasing the game. The only difference is that you will  receive the game from whence the campaign achieves its goal and the game can be printed. Don't worry, your money is safe if something should go wrong... to invest in our campaign you must choose one or more of the 'perks' on the right hand side of the main page here. The cost of shipping will be added before you donate, as needed.          Of course the main 'perk' will be receiving the game in all its boxed-up fresh-smelling glory, but there are different levels of perks which relate to different types of support that you can give the campaign. Perks include various objects, treats, special items that will not be available to the general public after the end of the campaign. As perks, we offer amongst others :
Personalised social media post thanking you for your commitment.
''BRAINBO! INDIEGOGO INVESTOR'  T-shirt for those purchasing ten games
Fridge magnet / pin badge  'BRAINBO! INDIEGOGO INVESTOR' for those buying multiple games
A pdf document of the original Stroop Effect Study from 1935
WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?The money raised from this campaign will go solely to the printing costs of the game. None of the team are taking any salary and other costs are borne by me and my company.  To print a run of card or board games, an economically viable minimum number of units is necessary – with BRAINBO!, 5000€ will enable that production.5000€ is NOT where it ends ... STRETCH GOALS :When we reach our target of €5000, we are not done! BRAINBO! So far exists in English only, and being part of a bilingual family I want to release the game in other languages, primarily French. As the campaign progresses and as we raise the total, stretch goals will open up making the printing of other language sets possible : 5000 for the first English set, 9500 for the french version, 14000 for the german version and so on!VERY IMPORTANT : During testing we actually came across many colour-blind people who could not enjoy the game unfortunately. 5% of all the profits each year from the game will go as a donation to a colour-blind awareness charity, like : http://www.colourblindawareness.org/RISKS & CHALLENGES :It is only right to be open and honest about the risks involved in running a campaign like this... Well, the beauty of a ""Flexible"" campaign here on Indiegogo is we can guarantee everyone who contributes will get their promised Perk. The game is designed, tested, prototyped, has a manufacturer ready; all we need is the investment to make it happen!""Superb idea of a game that kept our kids entertained during testing instead of always being glued to the TV or tablet!!!! It would be great also at the beach or pool. We could play together as well because age makes no difference to who wins!"" - Clare Leigh, UK ""We don't usually play a lot of card games but BRAINBO! blew our minds!"" - Helene & family, France""Such a great game for families and friends. Brilliant to take on camping trips, evenings out and any other travels you can think of. The design is gorgeous and nicely thought through, with lovely bright colours.

<h2><b>The idea!</b></h2>
<p>The idea came from looking at other peoples bets. Everyone wants to bet
randomly, but they all end up betting on the same pattern. Humans are not
capable of doing random things, which means we need some help when it comes to
the term ""random"".</p>

<h2><b>Why crowdfunding?</b></h2>
<p>Actually the reason is pretty simple. I love doing
some side project beside my job. On the paper, I am able to do electronics
stuff.. But I love to make the whole thing by myself and not just parts of a
project. But to make the whole thing, you need CNC machine faster that you
would imagine. <b>So this project will contribute some founds to buy my
own CNC machine. </b>As you noticed, my product does not have a low price.
The problem is, because I have to give my 3D drawings to somebody
else, who already has a CNC machine, to do it for me. And that does not come
cheap :)</p>
<p><b>For all of you, who will be founding this project:</b></p>
<p>-When the campaign ends, I will start manufactoring the dices.</p>
<p>-The process of manufacturing them and shipping them out, will last aprox. one month. So, thank you for your patience :)</p>

<b></b><p><b>What is a roulette
dice:</b></p>
<p>Roulette dice is a helping device, which helps you randomly
decide what to bet each game on the roulette. </p>
<p><b>Why:</b></p>
<p>Humans are impossible to act randomly. Even if we get a task
to randomly draw dots on a piece of paper, we will fail. Because inside of our
mind we draw dots based on a pattern. What if I told you, that chances for
winning a lottery with numbers 
1,2,3,4,5,6,7 are exactly the same as for 22, 37, 1 ,8, 11,33, 29? But
the fact is, you would never write a lottery ticket with numbers chosen
1,2,3,4,5,6,7! This is because it is not normal for us, we actually do not want
to act randomly, that is why we rather choose numbers like 22, 37, 1 ,8, 11,33,
29.</p>
<p>This is why we need help when it comes to choosing random
numbers.</p>
<p><b>Where can I use it:</b></p>
<p>It doesn't matter if you play an online roulette at home
behind a computer screen or if you play on a live table at the Casino.</p>
<p><b>How does it look like:</b></p>
<p>Roulette dice has 6 sides and each side is devided on 9
different  sectors. Which means that a
roullete dice has 54 different fields. On each of this 54 fields there is a
symbol or a number which tells you what you should bet on the next game.</p>
<p></p>
<p>                                  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/761347/files/20140802091505-dimenzija_kocke_copy.png?1406996105"" src="""" style=""width: 254.04578313253015px; height: 339px; cursor: nw-resize;""/></p>
<b>How do I use it:</b>
</div>
<div>
<b></b><p><b>Let's start playing...</b></p>
<p>First you need to check which winning number was drawn on
the previos game. This tells you which sector you have to look at when you roll
the dice. If the last winning number is a zero or a double zero, you will have
to pass next game. As you may know, zero and double zero belongs to the casino.
So every time previous game hits zero or double zero we will not bet in the
next game.</p>
<p><b><u>Playing
instructions:</u></b></p>
<p><b>1.  </b><b>Check previous winning number on the roulette</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Check history bar on the player screen, to
see which was the last winning number. You will usually have to do this just
the first time after  joining a new
table. For all future games you will have no problem remembering the last
winning number. </p>
<p></p>

<br/><p>Remember, if the previous winning number is
a zero or a double zero, you will have to pass next game in line. Because each
time a zero or a double zero is drawn as a winning number we will not play next
game, due to the statistics.</p>
<p><b>2.  </b><b>Selecting the sector</b></p>
<p>Depending on the previous winning
number, select which sector on the roulette dice you will be watching (1-9).</p>

What is a roulette

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Sam Ijeh the founder of samodesigns and I'm a super-fan like many of you. I started designing board games as a fun hobby (I know weird) and before I knew it, I had a small following asking me where they could purchase my games. I'd never taken it seriously before then but it's been a dream of mine to produce board-games that everyone can enjoy. We have been blessed with a few amazing opportunities. A major one being an invited to the South by South West Gaming expo in 2017 for a closed-door presentation.  But we still have a long way to go. Many of our previous projects have been spin off titles that require copy right privilege and other road blocks to put on shelves. That's why for this project we're bringing you a brand-new game that's unique original and free of restrictions. This by far is Samodesigns biggest project yet, and though I'm happy to say production is going great so far, if we can't get the game in the hands of you all, the players, its all for not. We need your help in order to make this dream a reality. Show your support for our campaign and help us in the quest to put the power in the hands of the players.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Samodesigns may be small but were no slouch! </p>
<p>To complete our project were requesting $12,000</p>
<p>This should cover our cost of materials, manufacturing, distribution, and if there any thing left over we can our artists. Kidding... mostly... </p>
<p>We've done a lot with a little in the past however with your contribution  we can deliver a level of quality that has previously been out of our reach. We're proud of our work and we want you to be proud to be a part of it!</p>
<p>We're happy to return the blessings in a show of appropriation  to any and all who support us along the way. Besides early access to the game, original signed concept art from our artists  and heavily discounted copy's when the game is released. We've got a few extra tricks up our sleeves... Stay tuned for details.    </p>
<p>If we're not able to completely reach our goal  don't expect us to throw in the towel so easily. As I stated before we have a history of being able to make a little go a long way. If we're able to reach the 75% mark on our campaign we should still be able to make things work albeit at a much slower pace. If we know there are people out there that want to play our game we will do our best to provide it and keep our supporters posted throughout the process.   </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>When I 1st decided to embark on my 1st major board game design project in 2015 I naturally turned to the internet for advice and was appalled at what I saw. Give up. Go home. Stop trying. Not satisfied with that I dug deeper and found the most positive message they had to offer at the time if you want to do this aim low. It doesn't matter if its ugly just make it and get it over with. Chances are if you spend a lot of time on your project you'll either give up halfway or end up wasting a lot of time and money when you realize know one wants it.  Obviously I wasn't going to be deterred so easily Mama didn't raise no quitter, and Pops always said if your going to bother doing something do it well. So ignored what they read, did it my way, and was very glad I did.I cant say we've hit it big just yet but we have experienced some personal levels of success.</p>
<p>We've played our beta's at the monthly board game madness in Dallas and received very positive feed back.  </p>
<p>Our Pokemon Legends game generated enough noise to get us an invite to SXSW gaming expo in 2017 </p>
<p>Were currently running 2 campaigns with our DND book: Clash of Ninja; A Naruto Story.</p>
<p>and were hoping for much much more!</p>
<p>When I think about what would have happened if I'd heeded the web advice and never started Samodesigns, I think about how many wonderful ideas, creative projects, and crazy fun games were choked out of existences before they got a chance to blossom. I want our little operation to be a guiding light to anyone who has an idea or an inspiration but isn't sure if they can bring that dream into the real world. Don't give up! If we can do it so can you!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>A obvious risk that we face is a financial one. Without funds we will be unable to produce a game with the quality or timeless that we would like. However small operations like ours are always fighting an up hill battle we will always find a way to make the best situation out of any circumstance</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Any dollar amount helps but we know for some of you even a few bucks is out of reach no shame we've all been there. </p>
<p>If a finacial contribution isnt possible for you right now but you want to support us pass the word on!  Let others know that your excited for the projects we're working on. The more support we have the more motivation we have to keep going.</p>
<p>Stay up to date on our latest development. Samodesigns will be at BGG con Nov 21-23 Come check out our booth see some of our previous projects or join us for a play test on Pokemon legends.We'll be posting updates concept art and sneak peeks as time progresses. And please be sure to leave questions if you have them. We always value the opportunity to engage with players.</p>

Besides early access to the game, original signed concept art from our artists  and heavily discounted copy's when the game is released. We've got a few extra tricks up our sleeves... Stay tuned for details.    
If we're not able to completely reach our goal  don't expect us to throw in the towel so easily. As I stated before we have a history of being able to make a little go a long way. If we're able to reach the 75% mark on our campaign we should still be able to make things work albeit at a much slower pace. If we know there are people out there that want to play our game we will do our best to provide it and keep our supporters posted throughout the process.   

The Impact
When I 1st decided to embark on my 1st major board game design project in 2015 I naturally turned to the internet for advice and was appalled at what I saw. Give up. Go home. Stop trying. Not satisfied with that I dug deeper and found the most positive message they had to offer at the time if you want to do this aim low. It doesn't matter if its ugly just make it and get it over with. Chances are if you spend a lot of time on your project you'll either give up halfway or end up wasting a lot of time and money when you realize know one wants it.  Obviously I wasn't going to be deterred so easily Mama didn't raise no quitter, and Pops always said if your going to bother doing something do it well. So ignored what they read, did it my way, and was very glad I did.I cant say we've hit it big just yet but we have experienced some personal levels of success.
We've played our beta's at the monthly board game madness in Dallas and received very positive feed back.  
Our Pokemon Legends game generated enough noise to get us an invite to SXSW gaming expo in 2017 
Were currently running 2 campaigns with our DND book: Clash of Ninja; A Naruto Story.
and were hoping for much much more!
When I think about what would have happened if I'd heeded the web advice and never started Samodesigns, I think about how many wonderful ideas, creative projects, and crazy fun games were choked out of existences before they got a chance to blossom. I want our little operation to be a guiding light to anyone who has an idea or an inspiration but isn't sure if they can bring that dream into the real world. Don't give up! If we can do it so can you!

Risks & Challenges
A obvious risk that we face is a financial one. Without funds we will be unable to produce a game with the quality or timeless that we would like. However small operations like ours are always fighting an up hill battle we will always find a way to make the best situation out of any circumstance

Other Ways You Can Help
Any dollar amount helps but we know for some of you even a few bucks is out of reach no shame we've all been there. 
If a finacial contribution isnt possible for you right now but you want to support us pass the word on!  Let others know that your excited for the projects we're working on. The more support we have the more motivation we have to keep going.
Stay up to date on our latest development. Samodesigns will be at BGG con Nov 21-23 Come check out our booth see some of our previous projects or join us for a play test on Pokemon legends.We'll be posting updates concept art and sneak peeks as time progresses. And please be sure to leave questions if you have them. We always value the opportunity to engage with players.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Ever wonder what it would be like to write an adventure with Gary Gygax? Around the year 2005, Gary started working with a small number of authors on a project to write new material for his world setting (which was totally not called “World of Greyhawk”). Bill Silvey was one of those authors, and this book includes the story of working with Gary as well as the adventure Bill wrote for inclusion in Gary’s campaign world. For obvious legal reasons, none of Gary’s original material is included in Lost Crypt: this module is all Bill’s work. However, those who are interested in Gary’s world setting will be interested to read material that would have been included in it if Gary had lived to see the project through...</p>

<p>A realm not terribly unlike our own exists in a strange and mostly hospitable nearby plane.

Having explored the uttermost depths and found the entrance, a group of adventurers can thus traverse this place in search of fame and fortune!</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p><i><strong>The Lost Crypt</strong></i> can be used as a standalone <i>5e</i> or <i>Swords &amp; Wizardry</i> adventure or incorporated into a larger dungeon complex or campaign. The adventure is suited for a group of 7th- or 8th-level characters, and should include a good mix of thieves, fighting-men, and magic-users.

<h3>Why the Tiny Print Run?</h3>
<p>Since 2012 our crowdfunding approach has been extravagant in every way. Ambitious with massive page counts, plus numerous add-on options and stretch goals. All supporting a primary title itself as many as 990 pages.</p>
<p>This has resulted in Kickstarter's with memorable pledge rewards that include top-quality hardcover books with sometimes dozens of stretch goal bonuses and add-on extras. These are awesome AND they are expensive to buy for customers like you because they are very expensive to make for publishers like us.</p>
<h3>Why not use Kickstarter?</h3>
<p>We will still be using Kickstarter, frequently, for our large-scale projects. These smaller projects are happening in response to the feedback we have heard from both fans and 'almost' fans alike. We hear the request for less expensive options for our projects and products all the time.

<h3>Project Reward</h3>
<p>With the wishes of the fans in mind, this and future Indiegogo projects will fund standalone projects that are both affordable and fun. This project, as well future Tiny Print Run projects, is narrowly focused with all stretch goals adding resources to the principle reward which traditionally would not be feasible for a publisher our size. </p>
<p>Examples of Enhancements from Higher Funding:</p>
<p>During the 14 day primary project period for <i><strong>The Lost Crypt</strong></i> and after the $1000 goal is met the focus will be to improve the delivered product.

<p>Hi! We're Jenn and Adam, the creators of Not Your Ma's Jong. When our grandmothers met for the first time, they didn’t speak the same language but quickly discovered their shared love of mahjong. We had each seen them play growing up, but realized that we never play with our friends. It’s tough to learn, and games can be pretty slow.</p>
<p>We reimagined this ancient pastime and created a brand new card game, based on mahjong and memories of growing up with our grandmothers!</p>
<h3>It's fast-paced, it's fierce, it's Not Your Ma's Jong!</h3>
<p>We worked through several iterations to get the gameplay fair, fast and exciting for 3-4 players. Instead of mahjong's 144 or more tiles, we have 75 fully illustrated cards based on our Chinese and Jewish grandmothers and their friendship. We've tweaked the rules as well so anyone can steal a card they need, keeping everyone on their toes!</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>These are hard, trying times</strong></p>
<p>You can feel the tension in the air, nobody feels safe anymore. War is stirring up once again on the continent. The last couple of years have been tough on the <strong>Alliance of the Great Cities</strong>. The loss of trust and faith between folk, the rise of corruption among the Vasalli, and the Vargan incursions have all taken a toll. </p>
<p>Still, life goes on in Salvora. The seat of the Alliance is to be moved to Liboria, the Jewel of the Sea, in the southeastern region of the continent. Liboria is a fascinating territory with towering mountains, wild rivers, and an unforgiving sea. It is home to illustrious characters, mighty leaders, and dangerous enemies. It’s a wild place full of mysteries, hidden locations, and treacherous roads.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>What is this ""Awaken""?</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<strong>Awaken</strong> is a dark fantasy tabletop <strong>role-playing game</strong> (TRPG) where you play as one of the Vasalli, a group of people who have undergone an unusual change that’s given them powers. You live in a war-ravaged world, where the Great Cities fight for supremacy and leadership over the Alliance: a loose political association holding together the territories of Salvora.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Ok, hold on! Fantasy world, people with special powers, Cities. Care to elaborate? </strong></p>
<div>
<ul><li>And that's not all. There are <b>sleeping gods, </b><strong>colossal guardians</strong>, <strong>underworld enemies of humankind and much more! </strong>But here is <strong>Logician Tim</strong> with his first impressions and intro to Awaken, so be sure to check it out if you want to see what Awaken is all about!</li></ul>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Ok, but how do you play it? </strong></p>
<p>Tabletop roleplaying games are to be enjoyed with the rulebook, a couple of dice and your friends! And this book will help you hit the floor running. </p>
<p>The Awaken game system was designed from scratch and tailor-made to bring out the strengths of tableside role-playing without the burden of the complicated mechanics that most role-playing games are built upon.</p>
<ul>
<li> The game emphasizes player interaction, has an immersive feel to it, and is filled with compelling narration.</li>
<li> Fast, fluid, and intuitive rules: We’ve designed Awaken for new and experienced RPG players alike.</li>
<li> We only use common six-sided dice, making it easy for anyone to play Awaken. </li>
<li> Character creation is quick and simple: The player has full freedom in choosing and mixing their skills, attributes, and Gifts (the special powers of the Vasalli).</li>
<li> The character development is skill-based and depends completely on how the player uses their abilities, not on how the dice land.</li>
<li> Picture Rule: For particularly creative descriptions, the player is rewarded with bonus dice or automatic successes.  </li>

<p> </p>
<p>The Liborian Saga includes: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Extended Regional Lore</strong> — Players and Narrators can expect to get a ton of new information about the Great Cities of the region: Jorgun, Rinean, and Liboria, and their domains. This will include detailed maps, histories, locations of interest, and story hooks. Explore the wilderness outside of the city walls, but don’t forget to stick to the road! </li>
<li> <strong>More Antagonists &amp; Monsters</strong> — A fan favorite! We’ve got you covered with expanded options for antagonists, as well as new bigger and badder creatures who can be found in certain places or all over the continent. From the heart of the mountains to the depths of the seas, the monsters are here! </li>
<li>
<strong>Regional Cults</strong> — Every city and region contains smaller cults which are usually radically opposed to the establishment. </li>
<li><p><strong> Superior Gifts, Rituals, &amp; Expanded Rules </strong>— Tightly connected to the regional Orders, Gifts are evolving constantly.  A flying dagger can be handy, but it isn’t nearly as good as a flying dagger on fire! </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Expanded Items and Weaponry</strong> — Salvora is a vast continent that’s filled with people from all walks of life, so it’s only natural that players should have access to a more varied selection of items and weapons to use throughout their adventures. </p></li>
<li>
<strong>“The Death Cycle”</strong> — A spree of brutal murders has struck Liboria. Numerous bodies have washed ashore, each covered in similar marks. It seems like the victims were killed in the same way. Is this the work of one serial murderer? Or are more sinister forces involved? This large adventure will take you through the three Great Cities of the region and showcase much of the information presented in the book. ​</li>

These are hard, trying times
You can feel the tension in the air, nobody feels safe anymore. War is stirring up once again on the continent. The last couple of years have been tough on the Alliance of the Great Cities. The loss of trust and faith between folk, the rise of corruption among the Vasalli, and the Vargan incursions have all taken a toll. 
Still, life goes on in Salvora. The seat of the Alliance is to be moved to Liboria, the Jewel of the Sea, in the southeastern region of the continent. Liboria is a fascinating territory with towering mountains, wild rivers, and an unforgiving sea. It is home to illustrious characters, mighty leaders, and dangerous enemies. It’s a wild place full of mysteries, hidden locations, and treacherous roads.  
 

What is this ""Awaken""?

Awaken is a dark fantasy tabletop role-playing game (TRPG) where you play as one of the Vasalli, a group of people who have undergone an unusual change that’s given them powers. You live in a war-ravaged world, where the Great Cities fight for supremacy and leadership over the Alliance: a loose political association holding together the territories of Salvora.
Ok, hold on! Fantasy world, people with special powers, Cities. Care to elaborate? 

And that's not all. There are sleeping gods, colossal guardians, underworld enemies of humankind and much more! But here is Logician Tim with his first impressions and intro to Awaken, so be sure to check it out if you want to see what Awaken is all about!
 

 
Ok, but how do you play it? 
Tabletop roleplaying games are to be enjoyed with the rulebook, a couple of dice and your friends! And this book will help you hit the floor running. 
The Awaken game system was designed from scratch and tailor-made to bring out the strengths of tableside role-playing without the burden of the complicated mechanics that most role-playing games are built upon.

 The game emphasizes player interaction, has an immersive feel to it, and is filled with compelling narration.
 Fast, fluid, and intuitive rules: We’ve designed Awaken for new and experienced RPG players alike.
 We only use common six-sided dice, making it easy for anyone to play Awaken. 
 Character creation is quick and simple: The player has full freedom in choosing and mixing their skills, attributes, and Gifts (the special powers of the Vasalli).
 The character development is skill-based and depends completely on how the player uses their abilities, not on how the dice land.
 Picture Rule: For particularly creative descriptions, the player is rewarded with bonus dice or automatic successes.  

 



 
The Liborian Saga includes: 


Extended Regional Lore — Players and Narrators can expect to get a ton of new information about the Great Cities of the region: Jorgun, Rinean, and Liboria, and their domains. This will include detailed maps, histories, locations of interest, and story hooks. Explore the wilderness outside of the city walls, but don’t forget to stick to the road! 
 More Antagonists & Monsters — A fan favorite! We’ve got you covered with expanded options for antagonists, as well as new bigger and badder creatures who can be found in certain places or all over the continent. From the heart of the mountains to the depths of the seas, the monsters are here! 

Regional Cults — Every city and region contains smaller cults which are usually radically opposed to the establishment. 
 Superior Gifts, Rituals, & Expanded Rules — Tightly connected to the regional Orders, Gifts are evolving constantly.  A flying dagger can be handy, but it isn’t nearly as good as a flying dagger on fire! 
Expanded Items and Weaponry — Salvora is a vast continent that’s filled with people from all walks of life, so it’s only natural that players should have access to a more varied selection of items and weapons to use throughout their adventures. 

“The Death Cycle” — A spree of brutal murders has struck Liboria. Numerous bodies have washed ashore, each covered in similar marks. It seems like the victims were killed in the same way. Is this the work of one serial murderer? Or are more sinister forces involved? This large adventure will take you through the three Great Cities of the region and showcase much of the information presented in the book. ​

<p>Hello wanderers!</p>
<p>I'm Taryn Masterson of 'Tarot at Taryn's'. I've started a journey to fulfill a dream of mine that would make an affordable, compact, tarot deck that you can pick up and use immediately while you learn. <br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1594745309/q9d3px0v6usrk7z7lo8h.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>Why Are We Doing This</h3>
<p>Along my journey, while working at a festival next to an apple orchard in the north of New York, I came across Mama Kat. Mama Kat is a tarot reader, palmist, and intuitive that shares my equal passions for helping people get their sh*t together as well as pissing off people that play gatekeeper to spiritual growth. Between myself and Mama Kat, we've got about 50 years of tarot practice under our belts and nearly as many states under our feet. We share a story that doesn't get told as often as it should, but that we believe speaks to people everywhere. It's the story of the prodigal child that, instead of returning home in repentance, spends all of her days continuing her wild and urgent search for universal truths without yielding. Our story is the story of every young person that set out on a journey with little money and little time to be f*cked around. We know you. We are you. We made you something.</p>

<p>We imagine a young woman who goes on a walkabout to get her sh*t together. She doesn't have a tarot deck, but she knows tarot in her bones because she lives it. She travels, and as she learns universal truths, she jots down the notes that become this deck. It's old and beaten from seeing the floors of traincars and truckbeds. It's seen rain, mud, and coffee on good days. It is not rainbow wisdom that tells you what sounds good. It is a journal and a guide based on life that is raw and real.</p>
<p>This is the tarot of experience.</p>

<h3>The Motivation</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Maybe what this deck is, is a touchstone to women who aren't living it up so to speak. Tough, brassy broads that don't always get ahead, but they at least survive and do it well enough. That support each other and know what a good friend is. They're tuned to the mystical, but they don't expect butterfly winged fairies to drop bags of money to get them through the day.</p>

<h1><b>Features of LED DICE</b></h1>
<ul><li>
<b>RGB LED's </b>- Every dice has 21 RGB lights, each side with it's own color. The 6 side is blue, 5 side green, 4 side red, 3 side yellow, 2 side purple/pink and the 1 side cyan.</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>Motion Detection </b>-LED DICE knows when you pick it up or roll it and the light activates. After 20 secs of no use, it turns off to save battery power. We do this by including an accelerometer which can detect any motion. We are very proud of this feature and hope you enjoy it!</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>Replaceable Battery</b> - You can change the batteries easily. Just unscrew the top and take out the old batteries and put in the new ones. It uses two small 'SR54' batteries which are sold at supermarkets and you can buy on Amazon for less than $2!</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>Made from aluminum</b>- LED DICE are made from the highest quality 6061 aluminum, carved from a solid block and very strong and durable that resists scratches, dents, and abuse. Very lightweight, only weighing 0.34 ounces or 9.5 grams</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>Produces fair rolls</b> - LED DICE are well distributed across each side with regard to it's weight. We have done our best to balance them, but we can't guarantee perfect balance. We can guarantee however fair rolls and no heavy skews.</li></ul>

The Frog God Games projects on Indiegogo are simple, focused, and short.</p><p>Thus, INDIEGOGO projects by Frog God Games will-</p><ul>
<li>Be short in duration</li>
<li>Be limited to a single title</li>
<li>Have options priced between $5-$30</li>
<li>Design all stretch goals and project bonus' affect the principle reward only (usually both the PDF and the softcover).</li>
<li>Be the only guaranteed method to get the premium* print copy (NOTE: the softcover versions  in this printing will not be sold on our website: see FAQ for explanation).</li>
<li>Have simple fulfillment process that does not use Backerkit</li>
</ul><p>*Premium means heavyweight glossy interior pages enhancing the art and color elements. The  thick, glossy cardstock brings out the vibrant color in Brett Barkley's cover illustration. These are the nicest softcover books we have ever sold and we only print a title this way once.</p><p>Any reprint would use print on demand service that, although nice, do not approach the quality of our INDIEGOGO funded books.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1585696266/td9zomasugabtqoe8pko.png"" src=""""/></p><h3>Why the Tiny Print Run?</h3><p>Since 2012 our crowdfunding approach has been extravagant in every way. Ambitious with massive page counts, plus numerous add-on options and stretch goals. All supporting a primary title itself as many as 990 pages.</p><p>This has resulted in Kickstarter's with memorable pledge rewards that include top-quality hardcover books with sometimes dozens of stretch goal bonuses and add-on extras. These are awesome AND they are expensive to buy for customers like you because they are very expensive to make for publishers like us.</p><p><strong>Why not use Kickstarter?</strong></p><p>We will still be using Kickstarter, frequently, for our large-scale projects. These smaller projects are happening in response to the feedback we have heard from both fans and 'almost' fans alike. We hear the request for less expensive options for our projects and products all the time. A second frequent desire expressed to us, whether at conventions, on social media or in email, is for a larger selection of smaller, faster-paced adventures that can be completed in 2-3 sessions and not necessitate a full two year campaign.</p><p>Additionally, Frog God Games has grown in both sales and brand awareness.  This opportunity will give us the additional resources to invest in the very best books in all of our formats. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Product enhancements tied to project success</strong> </p><p>During the 14 day primary project period for<i> Blight of the Moonglow Glade</i> and after the $1000 goal is met we will  improve the delivered product. There are no special tiered collectors editions or add-on purchase extras. Thus, as total project funding increases the better the final product will be for everybody.</p><p>Examples of improvements or additional content increased funding would bring to <i>Blight of the Moonglow Glade</i>  -</p><ul>
<li>Additional commissions for interior color art specific to the adventure. </li>
<li>The previous Indiegogo project added 2 interior art pieces and 3 extra creature illustrations for its appendix.</li>
<li>Printed Player map(s)/Insert. This is one we would love to do but it would require a substantial increase in overall project funding. For the Love of Valentine would be the best candidate yet for this.</li>
<li>Downloadable Options designed for popular virtual table-top software (The rewards for both How Orcus Stole Christmas! and In Vino Gigantus included the new creature/NPC tokens and player maps). </li>
<li>High-resolution files of illustrations to share with players at the table.</li>
</ul><p> </p><h3>Project Delivery</h3><p><strong>PDF Perks</strong></p><p>We will email the instructions to all eligible supporters with instructions on accessing PDF items. The PDF files are distributed using Constant Contact service and our web store. You will need to have a customer account on the Frog God Games website to get your PDF; it's how we keep track of everything and grants unlimited access by you to your reward.</p><p>The Indiegogo perk PDF files are 'purchased' at zero cost by supporters (as they are paid for during the Indiegogo promotion) at the Frog God Games web store using a coupon code. That code we will be sent via Constant Contact to the address provided by Indiegogo. Please contact us with any questions/requests about this.</p><p><strong>Softcover Perks</strong></p><p>Softcover perks will be mailed to the address provided by us via Indiegogo. </p><p> </p><h3>Overseas Shipping</h3><p>NOTE TO INTERNATIONAL BACKERS: Shipping international has become very expensive. We understand this. Likewise, some countries charge VAT tax or other fees to our customers on receipt. We cannot fraudulently lie about the value of materials we mail out. We are happy to ship you anything regardless of where you live, but we have to stay in business at the same time thus even our lightest books are affected. In the near future we expect to have a print on demand system in place for everyone overseas, It is not ideal, as the final book is not printed at the highest-quality when compared to the ones we fulfill in Indiegogo.</p><p>To explain what we mean, please see the shipping <a href=""https://wwwapps.ups.com/ctc/request?loc=en_US"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">calculator for UPS</a></p><p> </p></div>","Several weeks ago, a meteor shower illuminated the night sky over the Grand Duchy of Reme.

Frog God will come out of this crisis intact, so this isn't a ""keep the doors open"" plea, but we want to let you know that your purchase is one that you can feel comfortable about. It directly affects small businesses and households. We hope that all of you remain safe and well for the duration! The Project Frog God Games is continuing our INDIEGOGO offerings with Blight of the Moonglow Glade. The Frog God Games projects on Indiegogo are simple, focused, and short.Thus, INDIEGOGO projects by Frog God Games will-
Be short in duration
Be limited to a single title
Have options priced between $5-$30
Design all stretch goals and project bonus' affect the principle reward only (usually both the PDF and the softcover).
Be the only guaranteed method to get the premium* print copy (NOTE: the softcover versions  in this printing will not be sold on our website: see FAQ for explanation).
Have simple fulfillment process that does not use Backerkit
*Premium means heavyweight glossy interior pages enhancing the art and color elements. The  thick, glossy cardstock brings out the vibrant color in Brett Barkley's cover illustration. These are the nicest softcover books we have ever sold and we only print a title this way once.Any reprint would use print on demand service that, although nice, do not approach the quality of our INDIEGOGO funded books.Why the Tiny Print Run?Since 2012 our crowdfunding approach has been extravagant in every way. Ambitious with massive page counts, plus numerous add-on options and stretch goals. All supporting a primary title itself as many as 990 pages.This has resulted in Kickstarter's with memorable pledge rewards that include top-quality hardcover books with sometimes dozens of stretch goal bonuses and add-on extras. These are awesome AND they are expensive to buy for customers like you because they are very expensive to make for publishers like us.Why not use Kickstarter?We will still be using Kickstarter, frequently, for our large-scale projects. These smaller projects are happening in response to the feedback we have heard from both fans and 'almost' fans alike. We hear the request for less expensive options for our projects and products all the time. A second frequent desire expressed to us, whether at conventions, on social media or in email, is for a larger selection of smaller, faster-paced adventures that can be completed in 2-3 sessions and not necessitate a full two year campaign.Additionally, Frog God Games has grown in both sales and brand awareness.  This opportunity will give us the additional resources to invest in the very best books in all of our formats.  Product enhancements tied to project success During the 14 day primary project period for Blight of the Moonglow Glade and after the $1000 goal is met we will  improve the delivered product. There are no special tiered collectors editions or add-on purchase extras. Thus, as total project funding increases the better the final product will be for everybody.Examples of improvements or additional content increased funding would bring to Blight of the Moonglow Glade  -
Additional commissions for interior color art specific to the adventure. 
The previous Indiegogo project added 2 interior art pieces and 3 extra creature illustrations for its appendix.
Printed Player map(s)/Insert. This is one we would love to do but it would require a substantial increase in overall project funding. For the Love of Valentine would be the best candidate yet for this.
Downloadable Options designed for popular virtual table-top software (The rewards for both How Orcus Stole Christmas! and In Vino Gigantus included the new creature/NPC tokens and player maps). 
High-resolution files of illustrations to share with players at the table.
 Project DeliveryPDF PerksWe will email the instructions to all eligible supporters with instructions on accessing PDF items. The PDF files are distributed using Constant Contact service and our web store. You will need to have a customer account on the Frog God Games website to get your PDF; it's how we keep track of everything and grants unlimited access by you to your reward.The Indiegogo perk PDF files are 'purchased' at zero cost by supporters (as they are paid for during the Indiegogo promotion) at the Frog God Games web store using a coupon code. That code we will be sent via Constant Contact to the address provided by Indiegogo. Please contact us with any questions/requests about this.Softcover PerksSoftcover perks will be mailed to the address provided by us via Indiegogo.  Overseas ShippingNOTE TO INTERNATIONAL BACKERS: Shipping international has become very expensive. We understand this. Likewise, some countries charge VAT tax or other fees to our customers on receipt. We cannot fraudulently lie about the value of materials we mail out. We are happy to ship you anything regardless of where you live, but we have to stay in business at the same time thus even our lightest books are affected. In the near future we expect to have a print on demand system in place for everyone overseas, It is not ideal, as the final book is not printed at the highest-quality when compared to the ones we fulfill in Indiegogo.To explain what we mean, please see the shipping calculator for UPS",2.0,0,"21 Campaigns

<h2>The World of Veles</h2>
<p>Dead Throne is played within the southern kingdom of Lirennor.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530372229/hqvzg9yia8gz12v34gzr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>You can see the full timeline on our website <a href=""http://www.deadthrone.co.uk/timeline"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>
<p>Over 2,400 years of recorded history completes what we know of the world of Veles.</p>
<p>The Darkness is the only word used to describe what happened before our earliest record. Today it is 2410 ATD (after The Darkness) and the Kingdom of Lirennor has seen better times.</p>
<p>- The first significant note in recorded history is in the year 120 ATD. Magic pouring out from the ground and in all things born from nature. The Jinn were the first creatures who used magic and it wasn’t long before mankind began using the Jinn and focusing and learning the magical ways. These first were known as the enchanters.</p>
<p>- In 701 ATD the Kingdom of Lirennor is founded by King Terrowin. He was known as a great leader and conqueror.</p>
<p>- In 934 the enchanters were banished for causing massive earthquakes and destroying the land in their experiments with the new environmental scrolls. Thirty-one years later the mages took their oath. They vowed to protect and serve mankind against creatures and humans who sought nothing but chaos.</p>
<p>- 1250 ATD marks the year of the discovery of the great gold mines in Stonesea, a region of Lirennor. Lirennor becomes rich and powerful, but this wealth comes at a cost.</p>
<p>- In 1711 some of the mages are banished from the council as evidence of them turning dark spreads fear of The Darkness returning. Following this, many of the exiled mages turn to necromancy. They summon an army of undead and attack the Kingdom of Eirwen.</p>
<p>- 1824 ATD was a year of death. It was the height of the hunt for dark mages requested by the people. People from all the Kingdoms were rounded up and executed if they were suspected of practicing magic. The mages' council carried out these executions and although sanctioned in the beginning the people quickly began to distrust them. The final straw was of the execution of Gwen Hildegard, beloved princess of Lirennor. The mages became the official heads of police and abused their new power. It wasn’t long before the people responded with violence. And in 1915 the mages move their great library of scrolls away from the people who they feared. Tensions continue to rise, attacks by exiled mages and the people on the mages' council take place and in 1951 the council close their doors.</p>
<p>- In 1970 ATD the Fable Wars begin. The mages declare war on all the Kingdoms of Veles trying to take power for themselves. After many defeats Veles finally push back under the command of General Lothean. The mages are banished to Blood Stained Mountain and unheard from again for over 100 years.</p>
<p>- In 2085 the mages return. For years they have been building an army of undead that they use to desimate the Kingdoms of Veles. Only Lirennor remains but not for long. Gwiladith was an explorer and hero. She entered Blood Stained Mountain in 2098 and destroyed the source of the power controlling the undead army. The Battle of the Iron Gates ends with the death of the mages and Veles is finally free from evil. But not for long. Agrimor, a gold thirsty dragon enters Lirennor after the gold in the mines in 2312 and nothing is ever the same again.</p>

-- Objective

There are three ways of winning Dead Throne as well as multiple challenges and side quests.

Collect all the unique items held by other players and return to the castle before being caught by your opponents.
Defeat every other player to become the last player standing.
Defeat Agrimor, a fire breathing dragon, to collect the king's crown and return to the castle to win.

-- Box and Game set up

10, double sided, large hexagonal tiles make up the map.
5min or less set up time and pack away time.
New game each time with different map set up, strategies, game flow, cards and more.
Everything organised within the box already.

-- The Map
The tiles will make up the map. Each modular and unique, every game will be unique. You can see all the tiles here.


Each of the 10 tiles has their own unique art and features.
Large and beautifully detailed to immerse yourself within Lirennor.
24.5cm from side to side.
10, double sided, hexagonal tiles make up the map.
Can be connected in any way you like allowing for a new game each time.
Multiple paths to take, choices to make and features to interact with can be found on each tile. Traps are hidden and some quests direct you to specific locations found around the map.
Four different regions, each with their own level of difficulty and reward.
Each region has its own style, featuring lakes, mountains, fields and forests.
Tiles can be flipped over and twisted around, even during gameplay with the use of magical scrolls.

-- Moving and Interacting

Four custom, six sided dice to move with.
Land when you choose to, or when you reach your limit.
Use magical scrolls to teleport, carriage-men to travel between towns, relics and more to quickly navigate the map.
Interact with whatever you land on.
Each region offers unique rewards and challenges.

-- Battles


Between two or more players.
Battle creatures you find around the land.
Defeat creatures by inflicting more damage onto them than they did to you.
Defeat players by taking all their health down. 
You can end a battle by fleeing or calling a truce.
Join ongoing battles between other players.
Those in a battle or in the market do so in their own bubble when there are 4 or more players. Other players keep playing around them as normal so they don't have to wait.
Use magical scrolls to summon creatures to your aid, increase your weapons power, conjure new weapons, block opponents' attacks and much more.
Use weapons and armour you find around Lirennor in battle. As you progress you will become more powerful by equipping stronger items.
Combine items together to create weapon combos.

-- Traps and Quests



Trap your opponents throughout the gameplay with upgradable and hidden traps that are scattered around the land.
Tackle side quests to receive their rewards. Some quests are for all to compete for so you must be quick unless you want your opponents to get that ancient and powerful weapon.

 
-- Solo Play


Four ways of winning during the solo version. 
Play as one of the six heroes, Saladar doesn't play. 
The dragon, Agrimor is constantly getting stronger and chasing you. 

1) Defeat creatures and progress depending on their level. 
2) Complete quests to progress. 
3) Get half way on both challenges. 
4) Defeat Agrimor and collect the crown of the king, then return it to the castle.
 
-- Co-Op Mode - Defender Mode


1-4 players making this a Co-Op mode as well as another solo mode.
When between 2-4 players you will defend the towns of Lirennor from an ever expanding hoard of beasts.
Enemies will come out from everywhere and try to destroy the towns. Can you stick together or must you spread yourselves thin?
The game will increase in difficulty as you progress eventually leading you to battle Agrimor himself.

-- Scrolls


150 known magical scrolls.
Used to increase your attack and defense, mitigate your opponents' attacks, heal yourself or others, summon creatures, conjure weapons, enchant items, teleport around the land and even flip and twist map tiles around.
Start with three and obtain more to become more powerful.
Constantly discarding and replacing so you never know what you or your opponents might have.

The Card Tray
The card tray has been designed to manage your inventory of items. Each type of item has its own place allowing you to visualise and manage your cards within a smaller space. They have been designed to be half the size of a map tile allowing them to fit into each space seamlessly.


The Dead Throne Box


52 x 38 x 9cm in size.
Built with a focus on organisation in mind.
Everything is contained within its own compartments from the beginning allowing for quick set up time and quick pack away time.
The insert is made of solid plastic for optimal space management. 
All the cards are held within tuck boxes, and the awesome mechanical market held within the lid will lock to make sure no cards fall out.
The box, card tray and market have all been designed to allow for card sleeves.
Tokens and other pieces are held within their compartments so that they don't move about either.
The box can already accommodate future expansion packs so that you won't have to deal with multiple boxes for the same game.
The box has been designed to work with the gameplay rather than just be put aside. Everything works together, both within the game, and between the box and the game, for an awesome playing experience.

The World of Veles
Dead Throne is played within the southern kingdom of Lirennor.

 
You can see the full timeline on our website here.
Over 2,400 years of recorded history completes what we know of the world of Veles.
The Darkness is the only word used to describe what happened before our earliest record. Today it is 2410 ATD (after The Darkness) and the Kingdom of Lirennor has seen better times.
- The first significant note in recorded history is in the year 120 ATD. Magic pouring out from the ground and in all things born from nature. The Jinn were the first creatures who used magic and it wasn’t long before mankind began using the Jinn and focusing and learning the magical ways. These first were known as the enchanters.
- In 701 ATD the Kingdom of Lirennor is founded by King Terrowin. He was known as a great leader and conqueror.
- In 934 the enchanters were banished for causing massive earthquakes and destroying the land in their experiments with the new environmental scrolls. Thirty-one years later the mages took their oath. They vowed to protect and serve mankind against creatures and humans who sought nothing but chaos.
- 1250 ATD marks the year of the discovery of the great gold mines in Stonesea, a region of Lirennor. Lirennor becomes rich and powerful, but this wealth comes at a cost.
- In 1711 some of the mages are banished from the council as evidence of them turning dark spreads fear of The Darkness returning. Following this, many of the exiled mages turn to necromancy. They summon an army of undead and attack the Kingdom of Eirwen.
- 1824 ATD was a year of death. It was the height of the hunt for dark mages requested by the people. People from all the Kingdoms were rounded up and executed if they were suspected of practicing magic. The mages' council carried out these executions and although sanctioned in the beginning the people quickly began to distrust them. The final straw was of the execution of Gwen Hildegard, beloved princess of Lirennor. The mages became the official heads of police and abused their new power. It wasn’t long before the people responded with violence. And in 1915 the mages move their great library of scrolls away from the people who they feared. Tensions continue to rise, attacks by exiled mages and the people on the mages' council take place and in 1951 the council close their doors.
- In 1970 ATD the Fable Wars begin. The mages declare war on all the Kingdoms of Veles trying to take power for themselves. After many defeats Veles finally push back under the command of General Lothean. The mages are banished to Blood Stained Mountain and unheard from again for over 100 years.
- In 2085 the mages return. For years they have been building an army of undead that they use to desimate the Kingdoms of Veles. Only Lirennor remains but not for long. Gwiladith was an explorer and hero. She entered Blood Stained Mountain in 2098 and destroyed the source of the power controlling the undead army. The Battle of the Iron Gates ends with the death of the mages and Veles is finally free from evil. But not for long. Agrimor, a gold thirsty dragon enters Lirennor after the gold in the mines in 2312 and nothing is ever the same again.

SharkeeGames Ltd. reserves all rights to Dead Throne the board game. Including all art, illustrations, rules and designs.
Risks and challenges
The story, the rules, the entirety of the structure and the layout of all the cards have been completed already. All that is needed before we can start manufacturing is the remaining artwork.
The remaining art will have to be finished quickly and all the pre-production steps will have to be done quickly too. We will strive to send them as early as possible, but we will not sacrifice quality to meet this aim. Our goal is and always will be to send our backers the best possible game we can. And, of course, we will keep you updated every step of the way as we are in this adventure together.
We have done extensive research into our distribution methods, mapping every step of the way and are confident that it will run smoothly through our tried and tested fulfillment centers and freighter. However, we are prepared for any issues that might arise as delivering your game is our priority. If there are any delays, date changes or shipping issues you will be the first to know not only what happened but what we are doing to amend it.
I hope you enjoy the adventure and we look forward to sending our game to you, our glorious backers :)",23.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><i>It’s D-Day. June 6th, 1944. At dawn, the Allies send the greatest armada the world has ever known against German-occupied France. As the first wave of Allied soldiers step out of their landing craft, they are mowed down by machine-gun fire. You are one of these soldiers. And you’re not going to lay there, waiting to be killed. It’s do or die! You start moving, and shout to your comrades… “Follow me!”</i></p>
<p><strong>D-Day Dice Overview</strong></p>
<p>In D-Day Dice, players are Allied soldiers trying to organise improvised units for an attack against a machine-gun nest. Each player starts the game with a unit of a few soldiers and nothing else. As the game progresses, players roll dice to collect resources and advance on the beach, sector by sector, as the unit grows stronger and deadlier.</p>
<p>D-Day Dice will get you right there on the beach. You will experience the fear of getting killed by enemy fire, the anguish of losing your men, and the thrill of surmounting seemingly impossible odds to accomplish your mission. And since this is a cooperative game, all players are on the same side, fighting like brothers (and sisters) in arms! This game can be played by anyone (you don't have to be familiar with World War II) and has been enjoyed by families and wargamers alike.</p>

We’ve played for years, writing our own rules to expand on this type of content because the material we were looking for just didn’t exist. Now we have taken all these things, greatly expanded upon them, and built the concept into a fully-fledged campaign setting that can be played on its own or placed into any existing campaign setting.</p><p>Designed to expand options, but not necessarily power-creep; these crazy orcs with their guns and loud rumbling alchemical engined vehicles can be played alongside your traditional swords and sorcery content without much adjustment. The goal has been to add a lot of new content, that <i>works with all of the existing content</i> that is out there.</p><p>Evenly mixed with vibrant artwork and thrilling stories throughout the book, this will be a joy to read even when you’re not playing the game.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1569946575/lswbtapnvof3t22sry0m.png"" src=""""/><br/><strong>Savage Company Campaign Setting Book</strong></p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1569946600/rxbxde18ujfmpxwrl7ow.png"" src=""""/><br/> </p><p>Starting with the city of Tombstone, we have a large region that serves as both a setting for adventures and a home base to send parties to places anywhere in the world. Tombstone is full of locations and NPCs and as a rough and tumble frontier town, it can be quite dangerous.</p><p>We have added new races, variants of existing races, and more racial options and feats. Currently, we have about ten races fully written, with a few ideas for more.</p><p>There are over 20 classes and archetypes encompassing every type of character, with a heavy focus on archetypes that enable firearm use in new and exciting ways for classes that normally do not get to use guns. To go with these classes are new feats, skills, spells, and additional class options like talents, deeds, and discoveries.</p><p>Speaking of guns, we have about 50 weapons fully ready and play-tested, and much more ready to roll out. The focus has been to add weapons that don’t exist in the current game, are balanced to existing weapons, and have a historical flavor somewhere between the wild west, and the Vietnam war.</p><p>Along with those guns; are new types of armor, gear and equipment, and a large range of alchemical creations as well. Some of these are non-magical items that have the same effect as magic items currently in the game, and others greatly expand on the military theme. Have no fear, we didn’t forget about the magic. There are many new magic items and magical weapons as well.</p><p>Additionally, we have packed the book with iconic characters that showcase the new classes, gear, and short stories that expand upon the world; as well as accurately demonstrate their abilities and equipment in the course of narrative fiction. These characters also have fully built stat blocks at multiple levels, and can be used as pre-generated, or as a base to build your own for many adventures.</p><p>Along with our characters we have supplied new vehicles and a modular vehicle customization system that will allow you to quickly design hundreds of robust and wildly different types of vehicles. With these rules also comes the Rolling Road Combat ruleset. Rolling Road brings easy and fast-paced, fluid vehicle combat rules that make fighting on the move fun and deadly. To top it all off, you’ll also get Thrashcans and Thumpsters, unique vehicles that serve as mounts and have no facing rules allowing you to stomp across the battlefield in a mobile armored weapon platform.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1569946834/ltkwr061j5sp9cgam2k8.png"" src=""""/><br/><strong>Thrashcan Pilot</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1569947279/k2vjjwamraa4vx9sfojt.png"" src=""""/><br/> </p><p>Currently, we have <strong>90% of our book completed</strong>, comprising of <strong>over 400 pages</strong> of finished material.

We’ve played for years, writing our own rules to expand on this type of content because the material we were looking for just didn’t exist. Now we have taken all these things, greatly expanded upon them, and built the concept into a fully-fledged campaign setting that can be played on its own or placed into any existing campaign setting.Designed to expand options, but not necessarily power-creep; these crazy orcs with their guns and loud rumbling alchemical engined vehicles can be played alongside your traditional swords and sorcery content without much adjustment. The goal has been to add a lot of new content, that works with all of the existing content that is out there.Evenly mixed with vibrant artwork and thrilling stories throughout the book, this will be a joy to read even when you’re not playing the game.Savage Company Campaign Setting Book  Starting with the city of Tombstone, we have a large region that serves as both a setting for adventures and a home base to send parties to places anywhere in the world. Tombstone is full of locations and NPCs and as a rough and tumble frontier town, it can be quite dangerous.We have added new races, variants of existing races, and more racial options and feats. Currently, we have about ten races fully written, with a few ideas for more.There are over 20 classes and archetypes encompassing every type of character, with a heavy focus on archetypes that enable firearm use in new and exciting ways for classes that normally do not get to use guns. To go with these classes are new feats, skills, spells, and additional class options like talents, deeds, and discoveries.Speaking of guns, we have about 50 weapons fully ready and play-tested, and much more ready to roll out. The focus has been to add weapons that don’t exist in the current game, are balanced to existing weapons, and have a historical flavor somewhere between the wild west, and the Vietnam war.Along with those guns; are new types of armor, gear and equipment, and a large range of alchemical creations as well. Some of these are non-magical items that have the same effect as magic items currently in the game, and others greatly expand on the military theme. Have no fear, we didn’t forget about the magic. There are many new magic items and magical weapons as well.Additionally, we have packed the book with iconic characters that showcase the new classes, gear, and short stories that expand upon the world; as well as accurately demonstrate their abilities and equipment in the course of narrative fiction. These characters also have fully built stat blocks at multiple levels, and can be used as pre-generated, or as a base to build your own for many adventures.Along with our characters we have supplied new vehicles and a modular vehicle customization system that will allow you to quickly design hundreds of robust and wildly different types of vehicles. With these rules also comes the Rolling Road Combat ruleset. Rolling Road brings easy and fast-paced, fluid vehicle combat rules that make fighting on the move fun and deadly. To top it all off, you’ll also get Thrashcans and Thumpsters, unique vehicles that serve as mounts and have no facing rules allowing you to stomp across the battlefield in a mobile armored weapon platform.Thrashcan Pilot  Currently, we have 90% of our book completed, comprising of over 400 pages of finished material. Writing the rest will be easy, but we need help funding the remaining art, and having the professionals at Fat Goblin Games format everything into a nice PDF.We are guys with full-time jobs, and families; however, this hasn't hindered our efforts to fund the core project out of our own pockets. It is our intention to continue to do so. Your pledge will go towards the additional 40 pieces of art we still need inside the book and the layout artists who take our rough documents and turn them into gorgeous PDFs for you.FINANZES IZ HARD Additionally, renowned map artist Michael Tumey has agreed to create large detailed city maps of Tombstone and it’s undercity, this will breathe life into the setting and make it much easier to run adventures there.We’ve also decided to make a second bonus version of the book, FM 420-69(named by Facebook fan submission), an art and lore free and printer-friendly quick reference field manual.FM 420-69 Field ManualWorking with Q-Workshop, makers of the official Pathfinder dice sets, we’ve created custom sets of Savage Company dice, designed to look like they are made of bone and hand-scrawled with indicator numbers.Polyhedral Setd6 Set  We have a free preview of the book, the Savage Company Recruit Orientation Guide, that you can download now and check out! It contains 4 iconic characters, their stories, artwork, race, class, and all the new equipment each one is carrying. As well as detailed information about the setting and each section of the finished book.

Our joint RPG career began with Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons. After trying out many systems and worlds, we finally came to the decision to create our own setting and rules. The Argenekon and YARPS, back then simply the name for our pen &amp; paper rule system, were born.</p><p>YARPS and the Argenekon were developed conceptually and substantively over the years. The design of mechanics gradually took a back seat and questions regarding the content and conceptual issues for the creation of plausible, lively worlds became more important. In 2016, we began to develop a prototype for the YARPS web application specifically designed to create and manage complex worlds and support their use in role-playing. In late 2017, we decided to start a company and bring the project to market. Better Than Life UG (haftungsbeschränkt), a German company with limited liability, was finally founded in March 2018 and currently acts as the project owner of the financing campaign on Kickstarter and Indiegogo. The company is managed by Stefan Weidemann who is also responsible for the project’s technical development.  </p><p>YARPS is also funded by private investors who provide some of the capital needed for the market launch.</p></div>","YARPS helps you master the challenges of creating lively fantasy worlds, planning and evolving exciting stories and exchanging RPG-related ideas in an entirely new way with the assistance of our uniquely crafted digital tools.YARPS is not just another world or another story.

Each filled with functionalities tailored for the components purpose:  (Deutsche Version zur Enzyklopädie auf Youtube ansehen)(Deutsche Version zu 'Entity Linking' auf Youtube ansehen)(Deutsche Version zu 'Attribute Customization' auf Youtube ansehen)   (Deutsche Version zu 'Story Management' auf Youtube ansehen)  (Deutsche Version zu 'Interactive Maps' auf Youtube ansehen)(Deutsche Version zu 'Portrait Generator' auf Youtube ansehen)(Deutsche Version zu 'File Manager' auf Youtube ansehen) Building the YARPS Prototype requires time and hard work, which usually translates into money — as you might have guessed. We’d love to have YARPS in a feature-ready state as early as possible. With money as an undeniable constraint our backers on Kickstarter helped us to focus explicitly on developing YARPS towards its final, feature-complete state and keep the prototype instances running in the meanwhile. Our small software company already invested a lot of time — and money — and we will continue to do so because we believe in what we are doing. What we are asking for is your support to speed up the YARPS development. Any pre-order will help us focus on YARPS' development! That said, you can find our current release roadmap on our Website.YARPS is an ambitious project, and we are glad to have great companions on our side!

And of course our offers on Indiegogo have a significant discount attached!ABOUT THE TEAM BEHIND YARPSBehind YARPS is a community of role-playing enthusiasts, most of whom can look back on nearly twenty years of experience in numerous pen & paper and live action role-playing games. Our joint RPG career began with Advanced Dungeons & Dragons. After trying out many systems and worlds, we finally came to the decision to create our own setting and rules. The Argenekon and YARPS, back then simply the name for our pen & paper rule system, were born.YARPS and the Argenekon were developed conceptually and substantively over the years. The design of mechanics gradually took a back seat and questions regarding the content and conceptual issues for the creation of plausible, lively worlds became more important. In 2016, we began to develop a prototype for the YARPS web application specifically designed to create and manage complex worlds and support their use in role-playing. In late 2017, we decided to start a company and bring the project to market. Better Than Life UG (haftungsbeschränkt), a German company with limited liability, was finally founded in March 2018 and currently acts as the project owner of the financing campaign on Kickstarter and Indiegogo. The company is managed by Stefan Weidemann who is also responsible for the project’s technical development.  YARPS is also funded by private investors who provide some of the capital needed for the market launch.",51.0,8,"1 Campaign

<h3>Welcome to the World of Unlocked!</h3>
<p>Unlocked: Mansion of Mana is a set collection tabletop game where you take on the role of young wizards competing to become the last great wizard's apprentice. To win you must be the first to make your way through the mansion. But this mansion isn't just any ordinary mansion; each room you enter grants you an ability that can be used to get ahead or put others behind.</p>

Unlocked: Mansion of Mana is a set collection tabletop game where you take on the role of young wizards competing to become the last great wizard's apprentice. To win you must be the first to make your way through the mansion. But this mansion isn't just any ordinary mansion; each room you enter grants you an ability that can be used to get ahead or put others behind.

<p>The <strong>BYTE Roleplaying Game Rulebook</strong> stands at over 400 pages, and gives players everything they need to play tabletop RPGs in any setting. The book includes 10 technological levels and 20 thematic modules that can be combined in many unique ways, with each combination creating a different ruleset. This allows the rules to be tailored to the world in which the players want to immerse themselves.</p>
<p>From cowboys to spies, Roman gladiators to mecha pilots, elven knights to vampires, private investigators to galactic rulers, the book provides everything needed for your game. It allows you to play in any historical era or the worlds of your favorite books, movies, series, or video games. It can also easily be customized for use with any ""system-agnostic"" settings you own.</p>

<p>The <strong>BYTE Roleplaying Game</strong> is a passion project that has been in the making for the past 8 years, with many tweaks and revisions during that time. It is a wide-ranging book that takes inspiration from all sorts of entertainment media to offer a comprehensive resource to players. It has been playtested extensively by veteran players with over 25 years in the hobby.</p>
<p> </p>

<p><i>(Yeraksys: Dying World—one of the original BYTE RPG settings)</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Besides the ruleset itself, the <strong>BYTE Roleplaying Game</strong> also involves the development of 7 original settings. One of these—<strong>No Coin for Charon</strong>, an open world, ""hex crawl"", sandbox style, modern zombie apocalypse mini-setting—will be included as an appendix in the rulebook. The other 6 settings are planned for release in the coming years.</p>
<p> </p>

<p><i>(No Coin for Charon—a mini-setting included with the BYTE RPG Rulebook)</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Each rule and item within the <strong>BYTE Roleplaying Game Rulebook</strong> was designed and written in such a way to allow players to assess instantly which technological level, and which of the 7 original settings, it is applicable to. Each section of the book will be color-coded, and icons will be assigned to each chapter and element which link them to the pertinent worlds and eras.</p>
<p>As all the necessary rules will be compiled in the <strong>BYTE Roleplaying Game Rulebook</strong>, the setting books will focus solely on the lore (history, geography, cultures, factions, people, artifacts, etc.) and practical tables to generate thematic events and elements on the fly, assisting players to tell unique and evolving stories customized to each world.</p>

<p><i>(Ashes of the Heavens—wield divine powers and take part in swashbuckling adventures)</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>To tie it all together, the <strong>BYTE Roleplaying Game</strong> uses an easy to grasp action resolution mechanism. Each character has attributes (such as Dexterity or Presence, with values ranging from 1 to 5) and skills (such as Piloting or Leadership, with values from 0 to 5). When a test is required, the player rolls a number of eight-sided dice equal to the relevant attribute and compares the number on each die to the pertinent skill, aiming to roll lower than or equal to that skill's value. Rolled eights count as zeros and thus are always considered successes, but each seven cancels out a success. If at least one roll remains successful, the character achieves a favorable outcome for the attempted action. </p>

<p>No other kind of dice besides eight-sided ones are used in the game and there are many design decisions in place to make the game fast and exciting, from trying to pilot a starfighter to ruling a kingdom.</p>

<h3><strong>Risks and Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>The <strong>BYTE Roleplaying Game Rulebook</strong> has been in development for more than 8 years. It is a big book, but the text is already in place, fully written, and edited. Layout is already paid for and most of the commissioned art is already done. Physical copies of the book will be printed and delivered directly to backers by DriveThruRPG, a leading company in the market with more than 15 years of experience. As we, the creators, won't have to deal with printers, warehouses, and shipping partners, and considering that the book is practically done, risks of this project are minimal. The main challenge is having the remaining art, layout, and proofreading done in time. For that, we are giving ourselves plenty of time to have the required printing test so that vouchers for the physical copies may be delivered to backers in time with the PDF version in December.</p>
</div></div>","The BYTE Roleplaying Game Rulebook stands at over 400 pages, and gives players everything they need to play tabletop RPGs in any setting. The book includes 10 technological levels and 20 thematic modules that can be combined in many unique ways, with each combination creating a different ruleset. This allows the rules to be tailored to the world in which the players want to immerse themselves.
From cowboys to spies, Roman gladiators to mecha pilots, elven knights to vampires, private investigators to galactic rulers, the book provides everything needed for your game. It allows you to play in any historical era or the worlds of your favorite books, movies, series, or video games. It can also easily be customized for use with any ""system-agnostic"" settings you own.
 

 
The BYTE Roleplaying Game is a passion project that has been in the making for the past 8 years, with many tweaks and revisions during that time. It is a wide-ranging book that takes inspiration from all sorts of entertainment media to offer a comprehensive resource to players. It has been playtested extensively by veteran players with over 25 years in the hobby.
 

(Yeraksys: Dying World—one of the original BYTE RPG settings)
 
Besides the ruleset itself, the BYTE Roleplaying Game also involves the development of 7 original settings. One of these—No Coin for Charon, an open world, ""hex crawl"", sandbox style, modern zombie apocalypse mini-setting—will be included as an appendix in the rulebook. The other 6 settings are planned for release in the coming years.
 

(No Coin for Charon—a mini-setting included with the BYTE RPG Rulebook)
 
Each rule and item within the BYTE Roleplaying Game Rulebook was designed and written in such a way to allow players to assess instantly which technological level, and which of the 7 original settings, it is applicable to. Each section of the book will be color-coded, and icons will be assigned to each chapter and element which link them to the pertinent worlds and eras.
As all the necessary rules will be compiled in the BYTE Roleplaying Game Rulebook, the setting books will focus solely on the lore (history, geography, cultures, factions, people, artifacts, etc.) and practical tables to generate thematic events and elements on the fly, assisting players to tell unique and evolving stories customized to each world.
 

(Ashes of the Heavens—wield divine powers and take part in swashbuckling adventures)
 
To tie it all together, the BYTE Roleplaying Game uses an easy to grasp action resolution mechanism. Each character has attributes (such as Dexterity or Presence, with values ranging from 1 to 5) and skills (such as Piloting or Leadership, with values from 0 to 5). When a test is required, the player rolls a number of eight-sided dice equal to the relevant attribute and compares the number on each die to the pertinent skill, aiming to roll lower than or equal to that skill's value. Rolled eights count as zeros and thus are always considered successes, but each seven cancels out a success. If at least one roll remains successful, the character achieves a favorable outcome for the attempted action. 

No other kind of dice besides eight-sided ones are used in the game and there are many design decisions in place to make the game fast and exciting, from trying to pilot a starfighter to ruling a kingdom.
 

(Ghosts of T'Kelti—a dark space opera where technology is molded by the supernatural)
 
Do you want to know a bit more about the campaign settings with the BYTE Roleplaying Game? Want to discover what its innovative Token rule does to support good roleplaying? Want to have an idea on how the rules' modularity works? Want to understand how to customize your character's skills with more than 280 different abilities, making them unlike any other character in their world?

What you get by backing now
All perks for this campaign give backers the BYTE Roleplaying Game Rulebook PDF. The second and third perks also come with options for printed copies of the book through at-cost, print-on-demand vouchers from DriveThruRPG. In those tiers, you will be able to choose the full-color Hardcover version (letter-sized, 400+ pages) or its Premium Edition one (with premium-quality print). The art for the book will be composed of both commissioned illustrations and licensed ones (all of them full-color, high resolution, and, more importantly, high quality).
 

(Blades for the Dead Empress—dispense justice and face supernatural threats in an ancient world)
 
Moreover, backers will gain exclusive access to the full Beta version rules document this August—four months before the book's launch—allowing them to start playing right away. They will also have the opportunity to join the private BYTE Roleplaying Game Discord Server—before it opens to the general public in December 2020—and exchange ideas with other players and the author, giving valuable feedback directly to him.  

(Audio Tapes from the End Times—retropunk adventures set during a cold war in a fantasy world)
 
Who we are
This is an independent project being developed by people from different corners of the world.
At the center of it all is the author, R.G. de Barros, an enthusiast of the hobby for many years, who wanted to write the ideal RPG system for all the stories he wanted to tell together with his friends.

<p>What is Dirty Cash?</p>
<p>This is a unique, double rondel, dice based game with lots of player agency. As a player you will have many choices throughout game play. From robbing an opposing players business, buying one yourself, building your crew to take over the drug trade or becoming an infamous bank robbing unit. You will have the chance to put a hit out on other players, call a shootout or stop in for hand of poker at the casino, hit the Football Club and bet on a game, even take a loan out from the “Loan Shark” for that dope drug deal you want to make and much much more.</p>
<p>But be careful, the streets are rough in DC City. You will run into rival gangs and cops, make alliances and break them. Your goal?  To rule the streets and be the first to amass $100,000 in Dirty Cash!</p>
<p>Check out the perks for funding. From a digital poster to a first generation signed game, even becoming a character in the game, there are a wealth of options.</p> <p>What will we do with the money?</p>
<p>Over the last few months the Dirty Cash crew have been play testing the game to great result. Test groups absolutely loved this game. The DC team is happy to announce that we are this close producing the first generation (limited edition) Dirty Cash board game... with your help.</p>
<p>This campaign is set up to help the DC team get the game through the final stages of development. Though the game is “play ready”, we need to finalize designs such as 3d printed Figurines, dice and features on the board to name a few. The funds will allow us to grow portions of our team in order to get the game ready for first gen production. Giving us the ability to test print and narrow down where the final game will be produced. The only way to get your hands on a limited edition first gen copy is through donating to our campaign. Our goal is to have these finalize and shipped out by July.</p>

<p><i>Virtue Signal simulates the power struggles and one-upmanship that goes on between activist groups. The issues themselves are of little consequence, they are merely useful tools to get leverage over others.</i></p>

<p>The <strong>Deplorables</strong> expansion adds over a hundred new cards to the game, and allows you (finally) to grief other players as a disgusting internet troll.</p>
<p><strong>Meet the Deplorables</strong></p>
<p>The expansion contains 8 new characters, each with their own personality and special ability.  </p>
<p>This brings the grand total to 20.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>The deplorables are a game within a game.  The deplorable players use a separate deck all their own, with unique cards, game mechanics and objectives.</p>
<p>In place of NPC followers, the Deplorable player has <strong>raiders</strong>.  These are the disobedient minions who do your evil bidding sometimes but not really.   </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Like NPCs, raiders have a power level of one two or three.  Unlike NPCs they use the new black alignment (nihilist).  The most toxic raiders only have nihilist alignments.  You know, because realism.</i></p>
<p>Deplorable raiders operate as a kind of collective parasite, infiltrating the coalitions of other players, getting in the way, and being a general annoyance.  The more they infiltrate the more toxic they become, and higher toxicity levels grant the ability to use increasingly more powerful and obnoxious abilities.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>As you can see, the Antifa Crusader has a full-blown infestation on his hands.  If he does not win this Info War he will find himself in big trouble.</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>Every bad thing the Deplorable player makes happen gives him the the option of taking a trophy from his opponents (think stuffed heads mounted on a wall.)  When he collects the requisite number of trophies he wins the game.  </p>
<p>Winning as a deplorable character is difficult, but possible.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>but a mere taste</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Chaos.</strong></p>
<p>It wouldn't be terribly realistic if the raiders behaved like an organized group.  While the deplorable player(s) have the most influence over where the raiders go and what they do, they can be controlled by any player if the circumstances are right.  </p>
<p>Unlike NPC's, raiders can be moved around freely once placed: within a coalition and from one coalition to another.  Thus it is possible theoretically for any SJW player to weaponize their autism for xir own advantage.</p>

Virtue Signal: The Game of Social Justice is a card game parody of social justice activism.
In Virtue Signal you play as one of several different social justice warriors. The object, simply, is to attract a coalition of NPC followers to your cause, whatever that is. The first player to 15 is the winner.
Virtue Signal simulates the power struggles and one-upmanship that goes on between activist groups. The issues themselves are of little consequence, they are merely useful tools to get leverage over others.
May the wokest warrior win.

 

 ""A game for those who are ready to wake up from woke.”  –Peter Thiel
Holding steady at 8.2 on BoardGameGeeks with 50 ratings.
Now on to our show.


The Deplorables expansion adds over a hundred new cards to the game, and allows you (finally) to grief other players as a disgusting internet troll.
Meet the Deplorables
The expansion contains 8 new characters, each with their own personality and special ability.  
This brings the grand total to 20.
 
The deplorables are a game within a game.  The deplorable players use a separate deck all their own, with unique cards, game mechanics and objectives.
In place of NPC followers, the Deplorable player has raiders.  These are the disobedient minions who do your evil bidding sometimes but not really.   

Like NPCs, raiders have a power level of one two or three.  Unlike NPCs they use the new black alignment (nihilist).  The most toxic raiders only have nihilist alignments.  You know, because realism.
Deplorable raiders operate as a kind of collective parasite, infiltrating the coalitions of other players, getting in the way, and being a general annoyance.  The more they infiltrate the more toxic they become, and higher toxicity levels grant the ability to use increasingly more powerful and obnoxious abilities.

As you can see, the Antifa Crusader has a full-blown infestation on his hands.  If he does not win this Info War he will find himself in big trouble.
 
Every bad thing the Deplorable player makes happen gives him the the option of taking a trophy from his opponents (think stuffed heads mounted on a wall.)  When he collects the requisite number of trophies he wins the game.  
Winning as a deplorable character is difficult, but possible.

but a mere taste
 
Chaos.
It wouldn't be terribly realistic if the raiders behaved like an organized group.  While the deplorable player(s) have the most influence over where the raiders go and what they do, they can be controlled by any player if the circumstances are right.  
Unlike NPC's, raiders can be moved around freely once placed: within a coalition and from one coalition to another.  Thus it is possible theoretically for any SJW player to weaponize their autism for xir own advantage.
 

The nonexistent Fantasy Tradwaifu.  Wheat field and bloemenkrans sold separately.
 
From a gameplay perspective, we designed it so the deplorable player acts as a kind of game timer.  His development is slower than other players, but only increases as the game progresses.  If the other players take too long or fight too much amongst themselves, they will find themselves consumed by the batrachian horror.

Female-identifying characters are designed to be uniquely vulnerable to deplorables, but get powerful attacks against them as well. Just like in real life.

The Impact


 St . Clement's impact on the community can be seen in the outreach of our food pantry, community interaction, and social and theatrical outreach. We offer a harbor or respite to those looking for peace where they find hope.
    Risks & Challenges St. Clement's ministry is to its neighborhood and the arts community.  A large portion of its members are performing artists seeking to carve a career for themselves.  They struggle to support themselves while seeking work in their chosen fields.  Thus, their income level is lower than the average parishioner.  In addition, their presence within the congregation is more fluid than with the average congregation as they often times are away for significant periods on booked projects or are at the mercy of temporary job schedules.
St. Clement's also draws a number of young professionals who, as they advance in their careers, marry, have children, thereafter move out of the neighborhood to follow their  career paths or grow their families.
Some of the congregation is older and having to rely on fixed incomes.
Still others have special needs, are unable to work or hold positions of responsibility and are dependent on outside assistance to survive.
Each of these groups contributes to the support of St. Clement's as best as they are able, but their numbers are modest and the needs are great.
The challenges St. Clement's faces are somewhat daunting.  There is no endowment from which to draw funds to assist in building repair.   Whatever endowment St. Clement's has had is one.  The congregation is housed in a building constructed in 1872 which requires greater upkeep with each passing year.  
Despite these challenges St. Clement's is and  has been a strong presence in its community, with social outreach through projects like it's food pantry and by providing spiritual nourishment not only to those living in the neighborhood, but also to the many tourists who visit New York each year.  Its members are determined that its rich legacy should continue into a bright and strong future,
 With your help we hope to raise enough money for  an endowment fund which will allow us to resolve the above issues .

Every roll has a position which determines the severity of the consequences of failure and four possible results from a roll - a critical success, a success, a mixed success, or a failure. This guarantees that every time you roll, something will happen and move the story forward.

I haven't discussed most of the concepts and mechanics of that game here for lack of space, but it's a fiction first system where a character's actions and the consequences of those actions are determined by the circumstances surrounding it. It's a flexible system that allows players and GMs to judge a variety of situations and really lets players get creative. It's a framework for ruling on different situations instead of providing specific rules. </p><p>The FitD mechanics have been heavily modified to suit <i>Wicked Ones</i>. <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/19P2vdh7uc69fx8WWqZ739vNh1bNTz9N2/view?usp=sharing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Click here to check out the mechanics in a nutshell and some examples of play!</a></p><p>And here's a quick list of some of the cool stuff the <i>Wicked Ones</i> mechanics captures:</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>You draw out your dungeon</strong> - its rooms, tunnels, traps, creatures, things you discover, private lairs, and sanctum are all drawn out. It's obviously the most unique feature of the game and the dungeons it makes are creative and awesome.</li>
<li>
<strong>Players can roleplay monsters</strong>, meaning they don't feel bad about working against the group's interests because there's mechanical encouragement for sometimes playing up your monstrous nature and at other times, suppressing it to work towards group goals.</li>
<li>
<strong>You collect battle scars </strong>which give you permanent XP, making you gain abilities faster. Too many scars and you've been beat into a pulp, though, and your character is retired.</li>
<li>
<strong>You go feral</strong> when you take too much stress, a resource used to resist consequences. You become beholden to your flaws, having to act to satisfy them. You're truly a monster. Go feral too many times, though, and your characters slips over the edge and is retired.</li>
<li>
<strong>Magic is creative and on-the-fly</strong>. Players detail the spell they want to cast and the GM gives it a tier determining how difficult it is. Magic is very creative.</li>
<li>
<strong>Monster science is possible</strong> with insane contraptions, alchemical compounds, potions, and more. The system is flexible and rewarding, but with danger and volatility built in. </li>
</ul><p><strong>X Card support </strong>is built into the Wicked Ones. To put it simply, the X Card is an X on an index card that anyone can point to to signal they're not comfortable with the current scene for whatever reason. The GM then moves past the scene and makes a note to avoid such content in the future. Playing evil characters opens up some topics that might normally be off limits or never come up. This poses a very sensitive issue as what's off limits differs greatly from person to person. The game comes with a default set of ""off limits"" and ""off cameras"" that will probably be enough for most groups, but also has advice on having your own conversation about them and how to use the X Card.</p><p><strong>Roll20 works great with Wicked Ones</strong> and has proven to be a great tool for us during playtests. Drawing out the dungeon together is great fun. Roll20 character sheets and other assets are 100% going to get made prior to release.</p><p><strong>We started streaming our weekly playtests recently</strong>. It's not so polished and we're pretty new at this, but it's nice to get a look at how the game plays. We play on Thursdays at 7:30pm CST. You can check it out on Twitch at GLScuzz's (the Gromp player) Twitch channel.</p><p>You can also check out the latest session below. The first hour or so deals with setting up the dungeon and lurking activities, so you can jump forward to the 1 hour mark to see the gang jumping into some raiding.</p><div>

And when all your planning pays off and you wipe out an adventurer party, it feels really rewarding. At this point, I feel confident that others are going to love playing Wicked Ones as much as I do. </p><p>So we're on Kickstarter for two main reasons. First, we need more art. <a href=""https://ko-fi.com/ovictor"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Victor Costa (buy him a coffee!)</a> is doing all of the art for this project and creating an amazing, consistent vision that captures the tone of the game perfectly. We're about 25% of the way through the art for the book and great art takes time and money, money which I've paid on my own so far. It's important to me that I felt confident investing my own money in the project before asking others to back it as well.  Second, though, is that I want to expand the playtest. As soon as the Kickstarter wraps up, I'm going to release a playtest packet to all backers. I want to get more eyes on the game to help make it the best dungeon building game we can.</p><p>Thank you all for considering backing! After all, these dungeons aren't going to build themselves!   - Ben</p></div>","Wicked Ones is a Forged in the Dark tabletop RPG where you play fantasy monsters raiding human lands, hoarding the gold they loot, and building a dungeon to protect it. Your notoriety lures increasingly greedy and powerful adventurers to your dungeon. Can you  stave off the inevitable onslaught of heroism that your notoriety brings?Wicked Ones is essentially Dungeon Keeper meets Blades in the Dark.  You spend most sessions going on raids and building your dungeon, then every few sessions you put your dungeon to the test against invading adventurers. You play as monsters doing monster stuff and it's a hell of a good time. True Monsters are unique monsters that don’t follow callings, instead having their own set of unique abilities and game mechanics.  Bloodsuckers  thrive on feeding on blood but are hindered by their thirst and aversion to sunlight. Augres graft metal parts directly onto their bodies, but have an extreme fixation on metallurgy that drives them to acquire it at all costs. Heroes of the Empire are a separate set of cards featuring adventurers with moves inspired by War for the Overworld's Empire units. These are only available to backers who also receive the Toolkit.Dungeon Builder mode is a solo play mode where you build a dungeon by yourself, send minions out to raid, and defend against adventurers. It simplifies the mechanics of the base game and gives a more strictly defined ruleset for invading adventurers. This mode can also be used for easily generating dungeons to send PCs up against in other games!WFTO Splatbook is a 20-30 page splatbook containing all of the previous WFTO content plus a new sandbox map based on the WFTO world, factions, NPCs, additional content, and a new Underlord mode that better recreates the gameplay style in WFTO. You play as one of the wicked ones, monsters with the rare ability to see the bigger picture, to develop plans, work together, and use minions to further their goals. Every monster is flawed, with something deep, dark, and terrible lurking inside their heart - and you choose what your flaw is. It hinders you, leading you away from your goals, but play into it and you'll be rewarded with bonus dice called dark hearts to spend in play and XP at the end of each session. This balance makes it fun to play a monster that has goals, but is still pushed towards monstrous tendencies.Wicked ones follow one of nine callings, each giving unique abilities to choose from and XP triggers that reward you for playing into that calling's play style.In addition, each player creates a small group of minions - cutthroats, grunts, mages, priests, raiders, thieves, or tricksters. They make up the bulk of your dungeon's denizens. Players can slip into the role of these minions, fully fleshing out and breathing life into the dungeon. Essentially, players play two characters - their wicked one and their minions. Your dungeon is your home, your only safe refuge in a world that despises you. It's your defense against powerful heroes who would see you fall. Before the first session, you choose a dungeon style as a group, giving you a theme to build your group around and access to unique dungeon rooms supporting that theme.  Most importantly, you draw out all of this on the dungeon sheet together! Every detail matters and comes into play while defending your dungeon. Your dungeon isn't an abstract entity - it exists right there on the paper. The book will have a thorough guide with a lot of advice for those not familiar with drawing out dungeons.Your dungeon increases in power from tier 0 to tier 4 and consists of weak imps that do the manual labor, minions that players control, creatures that are attracted to your dungeon by your hoard, specialists that you hire to do specific tasks, dungeon rooms which provide powerful bonuses, traps with mechanisms and triggers decided when you build them, and locks to keep adventurers out of sensitive areas.  And at each tier, as your imps dig out your dungeon rooms, you roll to see what you discover underground - rivers of lava, spider queens, gold veins, gnomes, buried ruins, and more. The first level of your dungeon houses your minions, dungeon rooms, and traps. As adventurers invade your dungeon, players take on the roles of the minions and try to thwart them. If the adventurers manage to overcome your first line of defenses, they descend to the second floor and into your sanctum where the wicked ones wait for a climactic battle. Wicked Ones has a clearly defined cycle of play: Roaming, Raiding, Lurking, and Defending.

The cycle of play allows you to skip to the exciting bits, keeping each session action packed, while still allowing for the passage of time. Most sessions of Wicked Ones consist of roaming, raiding, and lurking with defending happening about once every 4 sessions.

<p>Hey chess lovers!</p>
<p>We know that there’s nothing like playing a game of chess on a real board. But, let’s face it. It’s a busy world, people stay miles away from each other and even if someone wants to come over to play, it requires a hell lot of a planning. Phew! Too much effort. Result, you give up and end up playing chess online. How boring.  </p>
<p>Square Off is all set to redefine the world of board games, starting with chess. Bringing to you the world’s smartest, most connected and the most evolved chess board. It enables you to play your favourite game against a fellow chess enthusiast from anywhere in the world. The automated board is designed to reflect the move of your opponent with precision. Not just that, you can challenge the artificial intelligence of the board too.  </p>
<div data-id=""14395133""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1480352800/ye8zzjb71a4srjcrksyw.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p>Yes, Square Off is here to bring back those charming old days when people played chess on classic tangible boards. Felt chess from their heart, indulged in the luxury of playing with wooden boards and handcrafted chess pieces. Where on one hand, it has revived the classic charisma of chess, on the other hand, Square Off has also made it smarter, automated and super fun.  </p>
<p>Want to play a game of chess with someone who is as passionate? Possible. What if that person is sitting far away? Possible. What if he doesn’t have the same board? Still possible. Now, what’s not possible is to have an excuse for not playing your favourite game.  </p>
<p>So let’s get connected. Let’s Square Off!</p>

<p>It uses a compact 2 axis robotic arm with a magnetic head beneath the box to move the magnetic chess pieces. The AtMega 2560 chip with Bluetooth BLE ensures smooth communication with a smartphone, taking care of decrypting and execution.

<p>Compatible with both <b>Android and iOS</b> (currently in beta) operating systems, Square Off is designed as a user-friendly app. It lets you interact with the board effortlessly; it just takes a click to begin the game.  </p>
<p>But why an app? The idea is to keep the <b>board button-free</b> so that the users can enjoy the classic chess board experience. Be it selecting sides (black or white), difficulty levels, opening moves of computer, challenging friends, analyzing games, using the timer or chatting with the opponent (this feature is being worked upon), everything is controlled through the app.  </p>
<p>Phone is connected to the board all the time <b>via Bluetooth</b>, allowing you to save an incomplete game. Also, it uses your phone’s Wi-Fi to connect to the internet and your phone’s processor to process the data and think of the next possible moves.  </p>
<p>Currently, it works on Stockfish 8 which is one of the best open source chess engine. We plan to offer more chess engines in the future.</p>

We know that there’s nothing like playing a game of chess on a real board. But, let’s face it. It’s a busy world, people stay miles away from each other and even if someone wants to come over to play, it requires a hell lot of a planning. Phew! Too much effort. Result, you give up and end up playing chess online. How boring.  
Square Off is all set to redefine the world of board games, starting with chess. Bringing to you the world’s smartest, most connected and the most evolved chess board. It enables you to play your favourite game against a fellow chess enthusiast from anywhere in the world. The automated board is designed to reflect the move of your opponent with precision. Not just that, you can challenge the artificial intelligence of the board too.  

Yes, Square Off is here to bring back those charming old days when people played chess on classic tangible boards. Felt chess from their heart, indulged in the luxury of playing with wooden boards and handcrafted chess pieces. Where on one hand, it has revived the classic charisma of chess, on the other hand, Square Off has also made it smarter, automated and super fun.  
Want to play a game of chess with someone who is as passionate? Possible. What if that person is sitting far away? Possible. What if he doesn’t have the same board? Still possible. Now, what’s not possible is to have an excuse for not playing your favourite game.  
So let’s get connected. Let’s Square Off!

Square Off mode: Challenge anybody, from anywhere in the world. You can either play board vs board or board vs app. The chess pieces shall move on their own, reflecting every move of your opponent.  
 Square Off Mode
Training mode: Play against the artificial intelligence of the board that can challenge you with 20 different difficulty levels. 
 Training Mode
 Live streaming mode: Tune into any match, worldwide. It also lets you record those matches and replay them, whenever you want.

An amazing audience, a prestigious award and many memories. October 13th, 2016. Maker Faire Rome.
 

It uses a compact 2 axis robotic arm with a magnetic head beneath the box to move the magnetic chess pieces. The AtMega 2560 chip with Bluetooth BLE ensures smooth communication with a smartphone, taking care of decrypting and execution. The most important thing is that it is programmed in a way so that the chess pieces don’t collide during automatic movements.

 
Square Off is ready and waiting to be placed in your living room
 
You, the board and a game of chess, what a beautiful Sunday morning. 
 

Compatible with both Android and iOS (currently in beta) operating systems, Square Off is designed as a user-friendly app. It lets you interact with the board effortlessly; it just takes a click to begin the game.  
But why an app? The idea is to keep the board button-free so that the users can enjoy the classic chess board experience. Be it selecting sides (black or white), difficulty levels, opening moves of computer, challenging friends, analyzing games, using the timer or chatting with the opponent (this feature is being worked upon), everything is controlled through the app.  
Phone is connected to the board all the time via Bluetooth, allowing you to save an incomplete game. Also, it uses your phone’s Wi-Fi to connect to the internet and your phone’s processor to process the data and think of the next possible moves.  
Currently, it works on Stockfish 8 which is one of the best open source chess engine. We plan to offer more chess engines in the future.
 

 
 
 Additional Features:   

Play against 20 different difficulty levels
Select opening moves with ease 
Load and save an incomplete game 
Membrane sensing technology to detect the location of pieces 
Receive audio feedback during check, promotion, checkmate and for invalid moves (invalid moves, strictly not allowed) 
Get all the instructions through the app, on your phone screen

Contract Manufacturer
When you manufacture a product, a lot of things have to happen in parallel. While testing our prototypes with new upgrades, we were simultaneously evaluating contract manufacturers so that we can seamlessly transition from development to production. 
 We've tied up with a US based contract manufacturer (CM) with over 25 years of experience in manufacturing. We have been working closely with them since a few months and completed DFM (Design for Manufacturing) according to the machines and tools available with them. DFM took a little longer as it was kind of redesign phase because of lot of upgrades in the product. 
Pre-Production Process

Our team members at the Motherboard Factory
We are making 20 pre-production units with the CM to test the assembly line as well as the performance of the product. It will be the final test before we proceed with the mass production.
To give you an idea, we are dealing with:
- 30+ vendors for the motherboard components
- 35+ vendors for all the other parts of the product. 
Plan ahead is to manufacture 2000 units (minimum order quantity of this manufacturer) together after the pre-production units are approved. Our CM is capable of handling large volumes and quality check would be absolutely smooth. Also, delivering to all the backers together would be fair and no one will have to wait :-)
We have ordered all the components and parts from these vendors which will allow us to immediately start with the production after confirming the pre-production samples, ensuring that there is no unexpected delay due to unavailability of components during assembly.
Shipping plan: 

We have tied up with a Silicon Valley based shipping company who has a lot of experience with shipping of Indiegogo products. They have their warehouse in San Francisco, Ireland and Hong Kong. 
Backers from Europe will get their reward from Ireland, backers from North and South America will get their rewards via US and backers from rest of the world will receive their rewards from Hong Kong. 
We'll email you the tracking numbers as soon as we have them!

Mike Cofer and Dan Letzring have worked together on a number of projects (in a variety of roles), but this is the first game that they have designed together.  They would not let distance get between them as they would find time to play test new ideas with each other over Skype.  It is a surprise they can get anything done with all of the bickering that goes on between them, but they found a way to power through and create a great game.

Jesse Labbe (Cover Art, Characters, Parts Illustrations) - It cannot be said that Jesse is just an illustrator.  He writes, creates stories, designs games, and he also draws!  From creating a world in the Berona's War graphic novel series to the American Stickman Military vs. Monsters book to the Cross Hares board game, Jesse loves creating worlds for people to play in! Jesse has provided artwork for all of Letiman Games titles (Dino Dude Ranch, Dirigible Disaster and Gadgeteers!).
Alisha Volkman (Gadget blueprint art) - Alisha is a night owl of an artist. She loves making art as much as she loves gaming. She gets her artistic inspiration from friends and life.  When Alisha isn't drawing or gaming, she is taking care of her many reptiles and fuzzy animals!

A most powerful Rakshesha. His Nemesis' personal zombie attendant.  The Pledge LevelThere's just one, it comes with the 4 minis. No add-on's, no pledge manager.

See the Pledge Levels section below for details.Build with EasePicking out tightly slotted pieces can be tricky, but we have just the thing! In every puzzle box, a free ""picker pen"" is included! This handy tool lets you pull out any piece in a snap. In addition, every box contains a ""building board"" that will guide your construction, as well as let you easily move your work-in-progress puzzles on and off the tabletop. Pledge for the full collection of all 10 planets, and you'll be able to construct a micro-model of our solar system. Each planet contains a special gear piece, that when assembled together, create a beautiful, mechanical interpretation of our galactic neighborhood. This mesmerizing motion machine can only be built by pledging for the Discover the Galaxy pledge or above. Not only this, but if you pledge for the full collection, you'll also receive a BONUS MYSTERY PLANET as a special gift. This mysterious bonus puzzle is a free gift to anyone who pledges for the Discover the Galaxy (Full Galaxy Collection) or ALL-IN: Discover the Galaxy + Display Stands pledge levels. In addition to these perks, we also have a special announcement...Not only will pledging for the Discover the Galaxy reward get you a free mystery bonus planet and the ability to construct a micro-solar system, but every Discover the Galaxy (Full Galaxy Collection) and ALL-IN: Discover the Galaxy + Display Stands backer will receive a set of mini-keychain versions of all 11 planet puzzles (including the mystery planet) FOR FREE! These keychains are made from shimmering acrylic and have transparent light leak patterns based on the full-sized planet puzzles! Hold them up to the light and watch them come alive!  ShippingAll IndieGogo pledges will ship before January 2020!Some important notes:

<p>As this is a student major project, there's obviously going to be some hurdles here and there.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>I was born and raised in Hamilton Ontario and I have been active in the arts and culture scene here for a few years now. I've made my own comic book and now I am on to making my board game!</li>
<li>How the game works: there are Act/Draw cards that you get to choose whether you act them out or draw them out based on your own personal preference every player guesses what is on your card and the person who guesses correctly moved ahead, as does the person who drew the card. They both get to nominate someone to draw from either the Drink or Strip card piles(Nominee's choice) which give you a daring action to perform for the viewing pleasure of the other players. Everyone has ""Bitch Out"" cards which can be used whenever you don't want to do anything, they can be picked up by another daring player. The Board itself is designed after the human reproductive system, and the pieces are little rainbow sperms. First sperm to reach the egg wins the game!</li>
<li>I came up with this idea while playing another game and decided to use the cards differently than they usually were used. This evolved to me writing my own cards, adding more rules and more cards for a more fun experience and then finally I added the board. I have broken out the prototype of this game at many parties and my friends are dying to buy a copy after playing it. </li>
<li>As an artist I can barely afford my own bills, but I want to make as many copies as I can to get this game out there in the world. Your contributions will help me make these affordable and well made without me having to eat plain rice for a month. Also, I will use a small local business to make everything and help boost the local economy instead of using made-in-china-slave-labour products. THINK OF THE CHILDREN.</li>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>Look, the more money I get the more games I will make. plain and simple. I get $200, ill make 10 copies and people will be sad cause they didn't get one in time. I get $1000 I'll make 50 copies and everyone will be happy, I'll have enough to give free samples to the board game cafes around town, and even sell them online. plus they will be much cheaper to make in bulk so I'll charge less the more I make. </li>
<li>I will send you a copy of my board game as a perk. donate more and I'll send you an expansion pack with more sperm and more dirty cards!</li>
<li>Remember, If I don't reach my goal I'll still make them, I'll just make less and they will be more expensive. So help keep things cheap by giving me more money... as ironic as that sounds...</li>
<li>I will be having a launch party when I finally have the games made,  all contributors will be invited no matter how small the donation!</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>

<li>My game makes parties more fun and dates less awkward. Ever been to a lame party where everyone was on their phone? bleck! Damn millenials... wait I'm a millenial...

<h3>Story</h3>
<p>My name is Lillian Medville. I created a card game called Your Privilege is Showing that helps players process their privilege. I did this, not because I had any experience in game design - I didn’t. Not because I’m an activist - I’m not. And not because I had a degree or expertise in social justice - I still don’t (but I'm learning everyday).</p>
<p>I created the first version of the game, Your Privilege Is Showing LIVE!, because I realized that I didn’t know how to talk about racism or sexism or privilege in ways that were both direct and personal, and when I looked around my community I saw that, for the most part, <i>neither did anyone else</i>.</p>
<p>I gave a TED talk all about the whole journey. You can check that out <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4b_ojKx6UI&amp;feature=youtu.be"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>
<p>I have been running Your Privilege Is Showing LIVE! games for a few years and it's been very impactful, joyful, and educational, but that version is designed for organizations as a professional development experience, and I wanted everyone to have access to at least some version of this valuable tool. It's a valuable tool because it’s effective: it asks us to answer for ourselves in ways that are challenging, while also being fun. Getting this game into more people’s hands is why I created <strong>Y.P.I.S. </strong>AT HOME!</p>
<p><strong>Y.P.I.S. </strong>AT HOME! is a simplified self-guided version of our facilitated LIVE! experience designed for personal social groups to play privately. It is a game for up to 6 players, is appropriate for ages 16+, takes about 90 minutes to play, and is never the same game twice.</p>
<p>Real-life scenarios are used to prompt challenging discussions related to social equity, oppression, marginalization, and the various types of privilege. Players engage each other's perspectives, delve into their own, and utilize personal knowledge and experience to practice how to have these conversations in progressive and productive ways.</p>
<p>It’s not about saying the “right thing”. It’s about saying your true thing and working to get more specific and accurate. The person with the most points at the end of the game is the Perfectly Adequate Human.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I’ve already play tested this game so I know it works. The entire game and packaging has been designed, prototypes made, suppliers chosen, and I've got the first run of boxed games ready to go! It's all been self-funded so far.</p>
<p>This campaign is for us to get pre-order capital to place the most cost effective inventory order and do all of the additional stuff  that comes with adding a new product line.  The goal will be split 70/30 between the inventory and administrative costs.</p>
<p>If you all help me exceed my goal of $8,000, all of the extra funds will be used as follows:</p>
<p>$8,000+ upgrades the <strong>YPIS </strong>AT HOME! web presence then website and marketing materials</p>
<p>$15,000+ allows the deployment of targeted brand building and marketing plans</p>
<p>$25,000+ I get to finally start hiring some help!!!</p>

<p>One of the important aspects of the game is that even if you end up being the underdog, seeing your opponent run away with all the victory points, you can still come out on top, claiming the victory. This is possible with our unique Player vs Player combat mechanism where, with a little luck, you can claim victory from almost certain defeat. This is made possible with the added randomness of the dice element.</p>

<p><i>Further expansions will introduce colored dice for all the different factions - truly EPIC!</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The different mission decks let you play against both ""the game"" and versus your opponent. You do not have to confront your opponent until you feel it is the right time to do so, and in this respect both players have total control over how the game plays.</p>
<p>You can of course also embark on a SOLO quest to gain RENOWN and counties in Garrandur! Three levels of difficulty is provided for beginner, experienced and advanced players. </p>

<p>Garrandur is one of nine nations on the continent of Kyro (shown on the opposite side of the full colour A5 map), and where this game takes place. Throughout the game you will go on missions across Garrandur, learning more about the counties and history as you explore and rise in power.</p>

<p>THE MINIATURES GAME:</p>
<p> We had originally been working on a massive Fantasy miniatures skirmish game for about 1 year when we decided to create The Rift War card&amp;dice deckbuilding game. </p>
<p>As we had a working ruleset for miniatures (use whatever suitable minis you have, we do not produce miniatures and no miniatures are supplied with either games) we decided to adapt these for use with the characters in the card game, essentially giving you TWO games in ONE package! There is even SOLO play!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603491340/wfomrgblojk5w3hues6f.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>Artwork by Evelinn Enoksen</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We sent an early copy of the PDF rules to northern norwegian Youtuber, DiceyGuy as we know he makes honest and REAL reviews (i think you can tell he loved the game, and playing with his kids):</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/PPb3ipmNIvY?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Not only do you get an awesome STAND ALONE miniatures game, you can even play the miniatures game as part of the card game's Final Encounter, to decide who is the ultimate victor. If you prefer Solo play there are rules for that as well, with 3 increasingly difficult scenarios. The 3rd one, ""Army of Darkness"" even lets you post your high score (and the party you used) in our Facebook group: S&amp;M games AS (Ltd.):</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/211437163405634"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/groups/211437163405634</a></p>
<p>Who knows, maybe you'll earn yourself your very own character in an upcoming expansion!</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/cpQ8bIT3dRc?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>In the PDF rulebook you will also find scenarios taken directly from the card game so that you may play those missions as stand-alone skirmishes.</p>
<p>The miniatures game supports upgrading your characters with items from the marketplace, loot from treasure chests and even picking up the weapons of fallen enemies or party members (requires the Exclusive bundle) in addition to having (for us) essential actions your characters may perform!</p>
<p>- Melee </p>
<p>- Charge</p>
<p>- Ready (lets you prepare for a melee attack against you)</p>
<p>- Ranged combat</p>
<p>- Move&amp;Shoot (you may shoot first, then move, or move and then shoot, as part of the same action)</p>
<p>- Spellcraft attacks (ignores both cover and armor but are harder to succeed with because of the delicate nature of casting a spell in the midst of a raging battle).</p>
<p>- Take cover (a reaction you can take to make it harder to be hit by ranged attacks)</p>
<p>- Search (search a chest, a fallen character, an area etc. If you find an item you may equip it as part of the search action)</p>
<p>- Open/Close (open or close a door, portcullis, trapdoor or similar)</p>
<p>- Jump/fall (yes, it will wound you, or even kill you, but might save you from that Darkbeast, but remember that the further you try to jump the harder it is!).</p>
<p>- Climb (The reward is great if you get your marksman on a higher level than the target. In THIS game, cover rules are actually EASY to understand).</p>
<p>- Push (off a cliff, or just to get out of that deadly melee, the choice is yours, let us just hope you succeed).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As the rules are based on the mechanics of baueda Wargames` 1-48Tactic ruleset, the game plays extremely fast and the rules are very straightforward, leaving little room for misinterpretation, and more importantly, discussion. </p>
<p>It lets you build a party of adventurers from the cards supplied in 1-48Fantasy: The Rift War       2-player core starter set, balanced with a cost for each character. Add one miniature for each card and you are ready to do battle in a rich fantasy world (well, on a 3x3 table populated by your selection of terrain), fighting your opponent for loot, treasure and victory! (PDF token sheet is also supplied).</p>

<p> </p>
</div></div>
<p>You can even begin a campaign, stretching over several games, where you fight for ownership of the counties of Garrandur, gaining their bonuses as you emerge victorious (this mode requires the county cards found in the Exclusive bundle)! You can even fire and hire party members between games!</p>

The different mission decks let you play against both ""the game"" and versus your opponent. You do not have to confront your opponent until you feel it is the right time to do so, and in this respect both players have total control over how the game plays.
You can of course also embark on a SOLO quest to gain RENOWN and counties in Garrandur! Three levels of difficulty is provided for beginner, experienced and advanced players.

If you pledge for the Exclusive bundle you will get access to some cool extra features where you will actually be rewarded with a county in the nation of Garrandur (where the game takes place) when you win a Final Encounter, and access to the marketplace. There is also added features to the miniatures game.
(Shipping cost will be collected after the campaign ends)

At the marketplace you can spend those hard-earned coins gained by risking your (party's) life, purchasing weapons and spells to further aid your party in the coming struggle. The ""save sheet"" included in the A5 full colour rulebook lets you record your progress if you decide to play a campaign that can stretch over many games, depending on what you agree with your opponent.

Garrandur is one of nine nations on the continent of Kyro (shown on the opposite side of the full colour A5 map), and where this game takes place. Throughout the game you will go on missions across Garrandur, learning more about the counties and history as you explore and rise in power.

THE MINIATURES GAME:
 We had originally been working on a massive Fantasy miniatures skirmish game for about 1 year when we decided to create The Rift War card&dice deckbuilding game. 
As we had a working ruleset for miniatures (use whatever suitable minis you have, we do not produce miniatures and no miniatures are supplied with either games) we decided to adapt these for use with the characters in the card game, essentially giving you TWO games in ONE package! There is even SOLO play!

Artwork by Evelinn Enoksen
 
We sent an early copy of the PDF rules to northern norwegian Youtuber, DiceyGuy as we know he makes honest and REAL reviews (i think you can tell he loved the game, and playing with his kids):

 
Not only do you get an awesome STAND ALONE miniatures game, you can even play the miniatures game as part of the card game's Final Encounter, to decide who is the ultimate victor. If you prefer Solo play there are rules for that as well, with 3 increasingly difficult scenarios. The 3rd one, ""Army of Darkness"" even lets you post your high score (and the party you used) in our Facebook group: S&M games AS (Ltd.):
https://www.facebook.com/groups/211437163405634
Who knows, maybe you'll earn yourself your very own character in an upcoming expansion!

In the PDF rulebook you will also find scenarios taken directly from the card game so that you may play those missions as stand-alone skirmishes.
The miniatures game supports upgrading your characters with items from the marketplace, loot from treasure chests and even picking up the weapons of fallen enemies or party members (requires the Exclusive bundle) in addition to having (for us) essential actions your characters may perform!
- Melee 
- Charge
- Ready (lets you prepare for a melee attack against you)
- Ranged combat
- Move&Shoot (you may shoot first, then move, or move and then shoot, as part of the same action)
- Spellcraft attacks (ignores both cover and armor but are harder to succeed with because of the delicate nature of casting a spell in the midst of a raging battle).
- Take cover (a reaction you can take to make it harder to be hit by ranged attacks)
- Search (search a chest, a fallen character, an area etc. If you find an item you may equip it as part of the search action)
- Open/Close (open or close a door, portcullis, trapdoor or similar)
- Jump/fall (yes, it will wound you, or even kill you, but might save you from that Darkbeast, but remember that the further you try to jump the harder it is!).
- Climb (The reward is great if you get your marksman on a higher level than the target. In THIS game, cover rules are actually EASY to understand).
- Push (off a cliff, or just to get out of that deadly melee, the choice is yours, let us just hope you succeed).
 
As the rules are based on the mechanics of baueda Wargames` 1-48Tactic ruleset, the game plays extremely fast and the rules are very straightforward, leaving little room for misinterpretation, and more importantly, discussion. 
It lets you build a party of adventurers from the cards supplied in 1-48Fantasy: The Rift War       2-player core starter set, balanced with a cost for each character. Add one miniature for each card and you are ready to do battle in a rich fantasy world (well, on a 3x3 table populated by your selection of terrain), fighting your opponent for loot, treasure and victory! (PDF token sheet is also supplied).


 

You can even begin a campaign, stretching over several games, where you fight for ownership of the counties of Garrandur, gaining their bonuses as you emerge victorious (this mode requires the county cards found in the Exclusive bundle)! You can even fire and hire party members between games!

 
We hope you are as excited about these games as we are and we cannot wait to start shipping the rewards, as soon as the campaign is successfully funded.
We will deliver!
Svein and Martin
Please note that shipping fees will be collected after the campaign is successfully funded as we will negotiate with several shippers during the campaign in an effort to reduce the cost as much as possible. The more backers, the lower the shipping cost!
UPDATE: October 31st 2020: We have successfully reduced shipping cost from about 20 Euros to around 10 Euros, worldwide. This even takes into account the added miniatures rulebook and tokens if we reach 20.000 Euros!
(in other words - we will not profit on shipping)
 
We are unfortunately only able to ship to the following countries, determined by Posten Bring Norge (our shipping provider). If you pledge from another country than this we will contact you and arrange shipping, although the cost might be a bit higher.
Shipping cost will be collected after the campaign ends and backers from NORWAY will have 25% MVA added to the pledge/shipping cost.

<p>Over the last 4 months, I've been interviewing the best game designers in the world and picking their brains for as much wisdom and insight as I could. And this book is the result.</p>
<p>Game design is hard. We all need mentors to guide our work and help us become better at the craft. In these pages, you'll find incredible advice from 60+ of the top designers in the industry today.</p>

<p>My main goal with the BGDL is to provide you with as much value as I possibly can. So, I've reached out to a TON of companies and freelancers who provide services that game designers would benefit from.</p>
<p>And they've come together to offer incredible discounts and coupons on things like rulebook editing. game components, development, playtesting, Kickstarter consulting, and more. <strong>You'll see the specifics at the bottom of this page.</strong></p>
<p>The savings from using just one coupon in the book could cover its cost.</p>
<h3><strong>The coupon books will be emailed to backers a few days after this campaign ends.</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The books will be individually numbered.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Meal at Dice Tower Con</strong></p>

<p>Going to Dice Tower Con? Want to hang out and grab a meal together?</p>
<p>Back the project at this level to join Gabe for lunch or dinner during the convention. The cost of food is included.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Skype Sessions</strong></p>
<p>Have you hit a design wall and can't figure out how to get past it? Need to work on your elevator pitch before meeting with a publisher? Got a sell sheet that needs another set of eyes to look it over?</p>
<p>Discuss these things and more with Gabe over Skype.</p>
<p>At this level, you'll get 3 (one hour) Skype calls to talk through anything game design related.</p>
<p>Calls will be scheduled throughout 2018 at the backer's and Gabe's convenience.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>REFERRAL CONTEST</h3>
<p>As a way to both get the word out about the project and thank the people who do so, there will be a referral contest running throughout the campaign.</p>
<p><strong>The 3 people who bring in the most money to the project through their referral links will win FREE games from Cool Stuff Inc.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1st place will get a $50 gift certificate</li>
<li>2nd place will get a $25 gift certificate</li>
<li>3rd place will get a $15 gift certificate</li>
</ul>
<p>To count as a referrer, you must promote the campaign with Indiegogo’s share tools (located at the top of the page) while logged into your Indiegogo account. This is important because otherwise, your unique ID won’t be attached to any resulting contributions or visits.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>When Funder A is logged into their account and uses Indiegogo’s share tools to send a tweet, for example, the link in the tweet includes Funder A’s unique ID. Then, when Funder B reads the tweet and clicks through the link to contribute, Funder A is recognized as helping bring in the amount contributed by Funder B.</p>
</div><div>
<p> </p>
<h3>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</h3>
<p>The book is 90% done, but as with any creative venture, there's always a chance for delays. Printing and fulfillment are being handled by a subsidiary of Amazon, so the likelihood of a delay in printing or shipping is possible but highly unlikely.</p>
<p>The books will be printed in multiple locations around the world, so the wait time for shipping will be drastically shorter than most crowdfunding projects. (No waiting for a ship to cross the ocean!)</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</h3>
<p>If now's just not a good time to help support the show, that's okay! Here are a couple other ways you can help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get on social media and help spread the word about the campaign.</li>
<li>Use the Indiegogo share tools to refer people to the project. You'll win FREE games from Cool Stuff Inc if you're one of the top 3 referrers!</li>
</ul>
<p>(Please note that you must be logged into your IndieGoGo account when using the share tools to get credit for any referrals.)</p>

Backers of this project will receive the book at least 2 weeks before it's available on Amazon.
If you would like to order more than one book, simply add $20 to your pledge for each extra book you want. (US or International)
 
2018 Board Game Design Coupon Book

My main goal with the BGDL is to provide you with as much value as I possibly can. So, I've reached out to a TON of companies and freelancers who provide services that game designers would benefit from.
And they've come together to offer incredible discounts and coupons on things like rulebook editing. game components, development, playtesting, Kickstarter consulting, and more. You'll see the specifics at the bottom of this page.
The savings from using just one coupon in the book could cover its cost.
The coupon books will be emailed to backers a few days after this campaign ends.
The books will be individually numbered.
 
Meal at Dice Tower Con

Going to Dice Tower Con? Want to hang out and grab a meal together?
Back the project at this level to join Gabe for lunch or dinner during the convention. The cost of food is included.
 
Skype Sessions
Have you hit a design wall and can't figure out how to get past it? Need to work on your elevator pitch before meeting with a publisher? Got a sell sheet that needs another set of eyes to look it over?
Discuss these things and more with Gabe over Skype.
At this level, you'll get 3 (one hour) Skype calls to talk through anything game design related.
Calls will be scheduled throughout 2018 at the backer's and Gabe's convenience.
 
REFERRAL CONTEST
As a way to both get the word out about the project and thank the people who do so, there will be a referral contest running throughout the campaign.
The 3 people who bring in the most money to the project through their referral links will win FREE games from Cool Stuff Inc.

1st place will get a $50 gift certificate
2nd place will get a $25 gift certificate
3rd place will get a $15 gift certificate

To count as a referrer, you must promote the campaign with Indiegogo’s share tools (located at the top of the page) while logged into your Indiegogo account. This is important because otherwise, your unique ID won’t be attached to any resulting contributions or visits.
Example:
When Funder A is logged into their account and uses Indiegogo’s share tools to send a tweet, for example, the link in the tweet includes Funder A’s unique ID. Then, when Funder B reads the tweet and clicks through the link to contribute, Funder A is recognized as helping bring in the amount contributed by Funder B.

 
RISKS & CHALLENGES
The book is 90% done, but as with any creative venture, there's always a chance for delays. Printing and fulfillment are being handled by a subsidiary of Amazon, so the likelihood of a delay in printing or shipping is possible but highly unlikely.
The books will be printed in multiple locations around the world, so the wait time for shipping will be drastically shorter than most crowdfunding projects. (No waiting for a ship to cross the ocean!)
 

OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP
If now's just not a good time to help support the show, that's okay! Here are a couple other ways you can help:

Get on social media and help spread the word about the campaign.
Use the Indiegogo share tools to refer people to the project. You'll win FREE games from Cool Stuff Inc if you're one of the top 3 referrers!

(Please note that you must be logged into your IndieGoGo account when using the share tools to get credit for any referrals.)",12.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h2>NatureMatch, the all-Canadian nature art game!</h2>
<h3>Designed by award-winning Canadian artist Aleta Karstad.</h3>
<p>To share her fascination with nature's enchanting diversity, Aleta has selected 36 miniature wildlife portraits in watercolour from her illustrated nature journals, and created a card game for everyone to play with her paintings!</p>
<p>The NatureMatch game allows Aleta to promote the legacy of a lifetime of original illustrated nature journals, and to encourage others to learn more about the beauty and complexity of nature..... and of course, it allows her to share her nature art in a beautiful, educational, and durable hands-on game for all ages!</p>

<p>Every day we lose species from the world. Many people will never get to see some of the creatures that may still be plentiful now, but have already been made vulnerable by climate change or human impact. Aleta's detailed art allows you to see them up close and personal. Their descriptions in the accompanying booklet turns you into ""the expert"", as you share your favourites with others.

<h3>How this all started :</h3>
<p>In March of 2019 Aleta struck up a conversation with a pleasant looking stranger in the Edmonton airport. Hours later they flew off in different directions, having forged a strong bond around the love of nature, and Aleta's art. The next time they saw each other, Natasha Prosser presented her idea... a matching card game of exquisite, close-up nature portraits in watercolour. This started Aleta scanning watercolours from decades of her hand lettered nature journals, and editing them to fit on 2-inch tiles. </p>

<h3>The Project </h3>
<p><a href=""http://froggodgames.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Frog God Games</a> projects on Indiegogo are simple, focused, and short.</p>
<ul>
<li>Short in duration (2-3 weeks)</li>
<li>Fast delivery of PDF once funding is completed</li>
<li>Limited to a single title</li>
<li>Have options priced between $5-$30</li>
<li>Stretch goals and project bonuses (if any) affect the principle reward only (usually both the PDF and the softcover).</li>
<li>Are the only guaranteed method to get the premium* print copy (NOTE: the softcover versions  in this printing will not be sold on our website: see FAQ for explanation).</li>
<li>Have a simple fulfillment process that does not use Backerkit</li>
</ul>
<p>*Premium means heavyweight glossy interior pages enhancing the art and color elements. The  thick, glossy cardstock brings out the vibrant color of the cover illustration. These are the nicest softcover books we have ever sold and we only print a title this way once.</p>
<p>Any reprint would use print on demand service that, although nice, do not approach the quality of our INDIEGOGO funded books.</p>
<p><strong>Why the Tiny Print Run?</strong></p>
<p>Since 2012 our crowdfunding approach has been extravagant in every way. Ambitious with massive page counts, plus numerous add-on options and stretch goals. All supporting a primary title itself as many as 990 pages.</p>
<p>This has resulted in Kickstarter's with memorable pledge rewards that include top-quality hardcover books with sometimes dozens of stretch goal bonuses and add-on extras. These are awesome AND they are expensive to buy for customers like you because they are very expensive to make for publishers like us.</p>

<p><strong>Why not use Kickstarter?</strong></p>
<p>We will still be using Kickstarter, frequently, for our large-scale projects, but we hear the request for less expensive options for our products all the time, especially smaller, faster-paced adventures that can be completed in 2-3 sessions.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Product enhancements tied to project success </h3>
<p>During the funding period for One Last Thing and after the funding goal is met we will  improve the delivered product based on additional sales. There are no special tiered collectors editions or add-on purchase extras. Thus, as total project funding increases, the better the final product will be for everybody.</p>
<p>Examples of improvements made to earlier products:</p>
<ul>
<li>Additional commissions for interior color art specific to the adventure. </li>
<li>The previous Indiegogo project added 2 interior art pieces and 3 extra creature illustrations for its appendix.</li>
<li>Downloadable Options designed for popular virtual table-top software (The rewards for both How Orcus Stole Christmas! and In Vino Gigantus included the new creature/NPC tokens and player maps). </li>
<li>High-resolution files of illustrations to share with players at the table.</li>

<p>NOTE TO INTERNATIONAL BACKERS: Shipping international has become very expensive. We understand this. Likewise, some countries charge VAT tax or other fees to our customers on receipt. We cannot fraudulently lie about the value of materials we mail out. We are happy to ship you anything regardless of where you live, but we have to stay in business at the same time thus even our lightest books are affected. In the near future we expect to have a print on demand system in place for everyone overseas, It is not ideal, as the final book is not printed at the highest-quality when compared to the ones we fulfill in Indiegogo.</p>

<p>Considering that many stretch goals got unlocked, the planned delivery date for InDemand costumers would be May 2019. This is due to the fact that our artist, Rozenn draws all artworks by hand, thus, needing enough time. Our expectation is, of course, that Darwin's Choice will be in your hands earlier, i.e. as soon as possible. </p>
<p>We have placed much effort into finding options to send Darwin's Choice to your home at a fair price. For this reason, the shipping prices are also subsidized, i.e. a part of the cost is covered by ourselves.</p>
<p>Switzerland: 10 $  </p>
<p>USA: 12 $  </p>
<p>EU, Canada, Australia: 15 $  </p>

<p>The idea for Darwin's Choice originally came from Marc, who is a huge animal enthusiast and therefore always had the dream of developing a game with animals. After a conversation with Samuel over a cup of tea, the basic game mechanics behind Darwin's Choice were born. Marc then created the first prototype with printing paper and chips from other board games. In countless test games Darwin's Choice was improved and optimized. New ideas found their way into the game, while others were dropped. In addition to internal test games, Marc and Samuel drove the prototypes all over Switzerland visiting over 15 game clubs and festivals. The feedback gained was intensively discussed during return journeys with best ideas and concepts finding their way into the game. After numerous prototypes and game versions, we are hereby proud to present the final version of Darwin's Choice. We hope that you and your fellow players will enjoy it as much as we do.</p>

<p>Rozenn Grosjean is a French freelance illustrator and the genius behind all of the artworks in our game, Darwin’s Choice. Over months she has by hand lovingly illustrated all the cards, chips, icons and of course our unique box cover. Each stretch goal achieved means that even more wonderful illustrations by Rozenn will be integrated into the game, and that we will work with her for several more months.  </p>
<p>The cooperation with Rozenn was excellent and we all had a lot of fun. Her professionalism, reliability and flexibility impressed us very much. We could not consider ourselves happier, and can warmly recommend a cooperation with her to everyone.

<p>Marc, Samuel and Elio have been friends for ages, so they have stopped counting the years. They know and appreciate each other very well, knowing what they have in each other. The different skills in the team make for a perfect complement. Marc holds a Master's degree in Business Administration (University of Zurich) and enjoys drawing a lot. Samuel completed his Master in Microbiology and Immunology (ETH Zurich) last year, and is a big fan of everything that is a bit geeky. Last but not least, Elio is the technical genius in the team, giving 3D printer courses and currently studying toward a Bachelor of Electrical Engineering (ETH Zurich). In addition to his help with Darwin's Choice, Elio is currently developing his own product, which he will bring to Kickstarter in early 2019.  </p>
<p>Beyond their friendship, the three are also connected by their love of board and card games. It does not matter whether a strategic heavyweight like Scythe or something lighter such as Munchkin. Darwin's Choice is a dream come true, which the three want to bring to the tables around the world. The entire team has invested countless hours and a considerable amount of capital - because the game should meet the highest standards and, above all, provide something for everyone to enjoy!  </p>

<p>Darwin's Choice has been tested, improved and optimized by us over months in countless test games. The game we present here is final and works without restrictions. All pictures/designs of the basic game (without stretch goals) are ready for production. </p>
<p>Since only printed products are used in Darwin's Choice, the risk of production complications is rather low. In addition, Darwin's Choice has explicitly decided not to use a complicated system of add-ons and additional rewards. This decision significantly limits the scope for shipping errors and allows us to focus entirely on the perfect finalization of the game. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are always unforeseen circumstances that can affect the process during the production/shipment of a game. Delay by third parties, shortage of materials, strikes and natural disasters can never be fully excluded. You can rest assured, however, that our team will do everything to reduce the influence of unfavorable circumstances to an absolute minimum. In addition, we promise to provide regular and transparent information regarding current status via updates and social media, so that you will always have a clear overview of the overall standing.</p>
<p>Darwin's Choice is our first Kickstarter campaign. But as is clearly visible from the campaign, we have become quite familiar with the topic and have done our homework. We know what to expect and where possible risks lie. Swiss people worldwide are considered punctual, organized and reliable, and we want to and will fulfill this cliché. We would be happy if you support our project, in return we deliver you a functioning, high-quality produced game on time.</p>

</div></div>","Darwin's Choice contains 273 cards, 187 cardboard chips, a box and a rule book. The basic version of the game is available in German and English.Heads, tails, wings and pairs of single legsBody and double legs  The cards of Darwin's Choice (sizes: 75x50mm; 100x65mm) will have 300gsm blackcore quality. Box and chips are made of 2mm grey cardboard. The rule book is printed on high quality gloss paper. It is particularly important to us that only wood from FSC-certified sources is used for all game components (incl. box and rule book), i.e. the wood comes from sustainable forestry. The core elements of Darwin's Choice are the vegetation zones and the animal cards. All vegetation zones have an individual food supply and different requirements to fulfill.Example of a vegetation zone and an optimally suitable animal cardThe objective for each player is to create animal species that are as optimally adapted as possible. Only these can obtain enough food for themselves in the vegetation zones, which is crucial for their survival.A player places a new animal species in the vegetation zone polar desert. Between the eras played, vegetation zone changes plus effects of event cards transform the prevailing conditions. Using sophisticated mutations, players can improve already established animal species or save endangered species from extinction.Mutations can completely change the appearance and even the diet of an animal species over time. Next to mutations, players may also move their animal species to other vegetation zones to ensure their survival or even establish the species at the top of the food chain.Adaptable animal species can survive in a wide variety of vegetation zones.Throughout the game, players try to collect as many Darwin points as possible with their most adaptable and strongest animal species. But they have to stay focussed until the very end. If a species dies out, then all but one of its obtained Darwin points are lost.The objective of all players, animal species with as many Darwin points as possible. Everything you need to know about the rules of Darwin’s Choice can be found here, in our rules explanation video and in the rule book.With a click on the yellow banner below you will find the English and German rules for Darwin's Choice.  Our declared goal (also see Language Stretch Goals) is the professional translation of Darwin's Choice into as many additional languages as possible.  Please note that the rules are not yet in latest design (reason: this is very cost intensive). The final game issued, however, will contain a professionally designed layout for the rules. The text ratio then will be significantly lower, along with many more graphical elements and explanatory images. Watch Phil, Samuel and Marc demonstrate a full game of Darwin's Choice. They are clearly having a lot of fun. Darwin's Choice was shipped to persons in 14 countries around the globe. We hope that each of you can find a reviewer whom you trust, and who can describe Darwin's Choice in your own language.  We have offered a small expense allowance to only 6 reviewers. These previews are marked with an asterisk *. Note however, that we have never paid for a positive opinion. Thus, each reviewer may freely express his opinion on our game.World map with the location of all reviewers                                                     The Dice Tower*,             Undead Viking*,                 Geek DadBoard Game Quest*, Everything Board Games,  Meeple Mountain, The McGuire Review             Roll for Crit,                Blue Peg Pink Peg,         Jeff Fuzzy Wenzel                                                     École du Jeu,                                                              Covil dos Jogos

The stretch goals have been designed to enhance Darwin's Choice as a whole, e.g. new beautiful artworks. No new components will be included into the game, because Darwin's Choice is already complete in its basic version.  




















 

Considering that many stretch goals got unlocked, the planned delivery date for InDemand costumers would be May 2019. This is due to the fact that our artist, Rozenn draws all artworks by hand, thus, needing enough time. Our expectation is, of course, that Darwin's Choice will be in your hands earlier, i.e. as soon as possible. 
We have placed much effort into finding options to send Darwin's Choice to your home at a fair price. For this reason, the shipping prices are also subsidized, i.e. a part of the cost is covered by ourselves.
Switzerland: 10 $  
USA: 12 $  
EU, Canada, Australia: 15 $  
Rest of Europe, Brazil, South Africa, Japan, South Korea, China, New Zealand: 20 $ 
Rest of the world: 25 $
Unfortunately, we cannot deliver Darwin's Choice to the following countries due to international regulations and problematic delivery conditions: Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, Kazakhstan, Myanmar, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, Sudan, Syria, and Ukraine.


We would be delighted to see our game on the shelves of retailers around the world.  
If you are a retailer interested in Darwin's Choice please contact us at info@treecer.com. We look forward to working with you.

<p>     Hello! I'm Kobey Gordon, the lead and as of currently, only designer and producer of <i>Zenith</i>. I've always been interested in creating games, especially those of the tabletop variety. A couple friends and I built <i>Zenith</i> after expressing our frustrations with current modern TCGs. This is a project I have been working on since middle school, and after going through build after build, prototype after prototype, I'm ready to show the world what a fresh pair of hands can bring into the realm of tabletop gaming.</p>

</h3>
<p>     Zenith is a Strategy card game for two players that takes inspiration from games like <i>Pokemon</i> and <i>Hearthstone</i>. There are stylistic and mechanical choices that give Zenith an identity, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pixel art style reminiscent of 16 and 32 bit sprite based games.</li>
<li>A simple but deep combat system where Unit cards change the way they act each turn.</li>
<li>No dedicated resource cards, like lands or energy. Instead, any card can be played face down as your resource.</li>
</ul>
<p>     As opposed to other collectible card games, Zenith uses the ""Living"" card game model. Instead of buying randomized booster packs with cards of varying rarities, Zenith discards rarity entirely, and a pack comes with one copy of each card in an entire set! This puts all players on a much more even playing field, encourages experimentation, and erases the existence of ""chase"" rare cards that can skyrocket in price.</p>

<p>     In order to play Zenith, you and a friend (Or rival, or arch nemesis) build a deck of exactly 40 cards. Each player draws three cards. If your going second, draw an extra card on your first turn. To play cards, you have to ""Tribute"" cards. Tributing a card means you put it in front of you face down. This card is now an energy card, and can be ""Rested"" (Turned sideways) to add one Energy to your stock. You can use energy to play cards or use attacks.</p>

<p>Huggy Slime is  a unit card. These cards stay on the field and use attacks once each turn. You don't need any energy to play this card, indicated by the blue number in the diamond. This unit also has two attacks, one that does 1 damage, and one that costs two energy, but heals and does more damage.</p>

<p>This is an Art card, and a card of the Fire type. Art cards have special one-use abilities that can help you.</p>

<p>Here's another fire card, this time an Item. Items attach to your units, giving them extra attacks and abilities. For example, if you attached this card to Huggy Slime, it could use the Throw attack, which is stronger than it's default attacks.</p>
<p>The key to being a great player is finding a strategy that's adaptable and synergistic. Good luck experimenting with the three elemental schools of Fire, Water, and Earth! </p>

<p>     You may be asking, ""What's in it for me?"". You might not. I can't read minds. But what I can do is tell you about our perks and our flexible funding method.</p>
<ul>
<li>Zenith WILL eventually release, whether we fully fund it or not.  I am asking for funding to hire many diverse and talented pixel artists, so my project can have as much aesthetic and flair as possible. I am also raising funds for the manufacturing costs of a bulk order, so I can travel around to local game stores and offer my product in as many places as possible.</li>
<li>The perks to your right allow you to be put on a special thank you card, get the game at a discounted price, get special alternate cards, and even let your original character, or even you, on a super powerful Zenith card!</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's a handy dandy pie chart I fully intend to be following regarding the funds:</p>

<h2>Why no Stretch Goals?</h2>
<p>     I have a very clear vision and goals for my project, and am aware of my limitations. Due to these factors, I am deciding not to bite off more than I can chew and will not be providing any stretch goals. <strong>However, all funds I receive in excess will be spent on commissioning more artists, and, more importantly, developing a second set of Zenith.</strong></p>

This card is now an energy card, and can be ""Rested"" (Turned sideways) to add one Energy to your stock. You can use energy to play cards or use attacks.

Huggy Slime is  a unit card. These cards stay on the field and use attacks once each turn. You don't need any energy to play this card, indicated by the blue number in the diamond. This unit also has two attacks, one that does 1 damage, and one that costs two energy, but heals and does more damage.

This is an Art card, and a card of the Fire type. Art cards have special one-use abilities that can help you.

Here's another fire card, this time an Item. Items attach to your units, giving them extra attacks and abilities. For example, if you attached this card to Huggy Slime, it could use the Throw attack, which is stronger than it's default attacks.
The key to being a great player is finding a strategy that's adaptable and synergistic. Good luck experimenting with the three elemental schools of Fire, Water, and Earth! 


     You may be asking, ""What's in it for me?"". You might not. I can't read minds. But what I can do is tell you about our perks and our flexible funding method.

Zenith WILL eventually release, whether we fully fund it or not.  I am asking for funding to hire many diverse and talented pixel artists, so my project can have as much aesthetic and flair as possible. I am also raising funds for the manufacturing costs of a bulk order, so I can travel around to local game stores and offer my product in as many places as possible.
The perks to your right allow you to be put on a special thank you card, get the game at a discounted price, get special alternate cards, and even let your original character, or even you, on a super powerful Zenith card!

Here's a handy dandy pie chart I fully intend to be following regarding the funds:

Why no Stretch Goals?
     I have a very clear vision and goals for my project, and am aware of my limitations. Due to these factors, I am deciding not to bite off more than I can chew and will not be providing any stretch goals. However, all funds I receive in excess will be spent on commissioning more artists, and, more importantly, developing a second set of Zenith.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Something new, something old</h3>
<p>Fairytale is a game first and foremost about, well, Fairytales. Mimicking their structure and themes heavily, the game works around a unique mechanic, which by its Fairytale counterpart is called Morals.</p>
<p>Fairytale is very divergent from most traditional RPGs, which is a little ironic, considering how traditional the subject matter is. But it's all necessary to make the game work and feel like a fairytale.</p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>There are some layers to how Fairytale's basic gameplay works.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Narrator defines the Morals of each story and game session.</li>
<li>Alongside normal roleplaying, the players will encounter these morals, and the morals will affect the rolls they make.</li>
<li>When a difficult situation is starting to resolve, the players' rolls will define what approaches they can use in which situations to what effect, but regardless of how well they roll, using the wrong approach means the player will suffer more than from just failing.</li>
<li>The wrong approach is mostly defined by common sense and morals of the story.</li>
</ul>
<p>The preliminary document and any updates to the game can be read on my <a href=""https://www.artificergames.com/current-projects-live"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website.</a></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why crowdfunding?</h3>
<p>Short version, I need to pay my artist and editor, and to feed myself.</p>
<p>I am a very labor-intensive and quite the resourceful person. I can do pretty much everything from layouting, general graphic design and writing myself. So had I the ability to do absolutely everything myself, I would. But I don't trust my skills in artistry and editing. And those things don't come free.</p>
<p>Additionally, I have little income outside of making games, so crowdfunding seems like the obvious path to take. </p>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<p>Aiding me on this journey at all nets you access to the game's Discord server before its launch, and with it, the access to the playtest version of the game. </p>
<p>Tiers for the physical copies of the game are the same cost, for a very good reason. Read the next chapter to find out why.</p>
<h3>Postage and Printage</h3>
<p>The copies of the game will be sent through DrivethruRPG. For physical copies, you need to pay for the shipping and possibly printing, because figuring all of this out alone is really hard.</p>
<p>The postage is a wild card, depending on your country. I can't affect it</p>
<p>The printing will cost around 3-5€ / 4-6$ for softcover, 7-9€ / 8-10$ for hardcover, depending on the length of the game and whether the artwork will be in full color.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
<p>I will include some stretch goals beyond the 4000€ funding, but I am not going to invest too heavily on bonus materials, because I can't really come up with anything more to give.</p>
<p><strong>Art upgrades</strong></p>
<p><b>Custom Tokens (Includes a perk for them)</b></p>

I'm Matt and I'm bringing a tabletop games and comic book shop to Gloucester, working with my wife we aim to bring this much needed shop to the streets and put our own spin on things.</p><p>The plan itself has been in it's planning stage for a long time and we'll soon be in a position to open. We're currently in the process of trying to secure a premises but the options appear to be few and far between so we're running a crowd funding campaign to help raise funds to put towards a bigger and better premises. As a workaround whilst we look and try to secure something, we're bringing ourselves to Gloucester's outdoor market. We're really eager to get out there and our customers are equally eager see us out there.</p><p>Here's what our customers are already saying on our <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/geekwithinltd"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook page</a>:</p><p><strong><i>""About time we had a comic shop here""</i></strong></p><p><strong><i>""Can't wait for you to open.""</i></strong></p><p><strong><i>""Really chuffed an independent gaming shop is heading our way. Haven't been to the other gaming shop for a very long time.""</i></strong></p><p><strong><i>""Mtg too?! Dammit I just got out!! Good job I didn't sell my cards!!""</i></strong></p><p><strong><i>""Absolutely hyped for this. Haven't been able to play magic in the last 2 years so will be nice to get back into it with other fans and players""</i></strong></p><p><strong><i>""The city needs you!""</i></strong></p><p>After reviewing our business plan, cutting some costs and rearranging some of our plans we believe we can now accommodate a higher cost of premises both short and long term but still need to make up the difference between what we have and the what we need for initial costs of moving in. This normally equates to 3 - 6 months rent and potentially 3 - 6 months rent again for a deposit amongst other things. By performing some cost saving measures, we were able to make some of this up ourselves but now we need to make up the rest, this is where you come in.</p><p>Our goal is £3,250 and in the grand scheme of things it seems like a relatively small amount, but it will absolutely make all the difference and increase our options of what premises will be available to us exponentially.</p><p>We originally considered more traditional methods of raising more funding but decided on crowd funding as it gives us a unique platform to interact with our customers and allows us to provide some fantastic rewards and experiences as part of the process. It also allows our customers to be part of our creation.</p><h2>The Shop...</h2><p>As you would expect we're passionate about games and comics but the idea came around when I attended a tournament for Warhammer 40,000. My army was far from up to the task, eventually coming second from last but I still came away feeling like I had a great day. The community (I didn't know anyone there at the time), the camaraderie, the organisation, it was all there and I knew at that point that I wanted to run a store, not only recreate these experiences through a multitude of games and events but also improve on them, having every customer leave at the end of the day feeling they had a great time at our shop and counting the hours until they can come back. I spent some time working for Games Workshop which was also a fantastic experience and only fuelled the fire of opening our own shop.</p><p>I've also been a fan of comic books for as long as I can remember and I've found over the years that these two hobbies cross over on a regular basis with each other so I decided to combine the two into a single shop. I launched an online comic book subscription service which in itself was successful but was ultimately stopped when I realised it was the bricks and mortar store that I craved, the face to face interaction, not simply selling them.</p><p>In store you can expect to find games such as Warhammer 40,000, Age of Sigmar, Infinity and Bolt Action, TCGs, LCGs, RPGs and comic books from your favourite publishers with related merchandise such as toys, gifts and clothing. We're also in the process of designing our very own gear (some of which you'll be able to find as perks here!).</p><p>We'll be running regular events in store such as tournaments, painting competitions, painting lessons from professional miniature painters, Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaigns, regular Magic the Gathering events and so, so much more. This is far from an exhaustive list but should give an idea of what we're trying to achieve.</p><p>We've planned a rough layout of the shop and how we envisage how it will look, we're looking to split inventory of games and comics equally with a smaller section for pop culture. This coincides with the market research we've performed locally as well as further afield and will be adjusted as and when required. The shop itself will be as open and as least cluttered as possible with emphasis on being able to navigate through the store without the need the say ""oops, sorry"" when we're at our busiest. This will all be taken into consideration when selecting our premises.</p><p>We also have a loyalty scheme planned, not only will you be rewarded for your loyalty to the store by buying through us but also for being a great community player, for example, helping others play games, running RPG campaigns etc which will help promote the community spirit which we strive for in store.</p><p>When a customer enters the store we want to give them the best possible experience by providing excellent customer service, offering an open and inviting shop, a community experience, exciting events for everyone, regardless of skill level and ensuring that when that customer has left, they'll be wanting to come back as soon as possible, whether that person has come from Gloucester or not.</p><h3>Our commitment to running our shop:</h3><ul>

</ul><p>Whilst we were researching our name we settled on Geek Within to represent the little (or big) geek within all of us. To be able to indulge your inner geek regardless of who you are or where you're from, and for that, we have to make the best possible shop and be open and inviting to everyone.</p><h2>What do you get?</h2><p>We've thought long and hard about what rewards to provide and we've come up with rewards that would cater to those who will regularly frequent the shop, those who won't and those who are our most dedicated of fans and want the very best from us.</p><p>With every pledge, you have directly helped us and we want to tell the world that you've helped us get there, that's why with every pledge you will have your name immortalised on our website as a thank you for helping making this happen.</p><p>We've also added some early bird versions of our perks for those quickest off the mark, hurry though, there's not many!</p><p>Please note that for reasons out of our control, final designs may vary slightly.</p><h3>£10 - Founders Mug</h3><p>You'll get your name immortalised on our website. You'll also get a founders mug.</p><h3>£10 - Geek Within Dice</h3><p>You'll get your name immortalised on our website. You'll also get a set of 16 Geek Within dice.</p><h3>£25 - Messenger Bag</h3><p>You'll get your name immortalised on our website. You'll also get a messenger bag, ideal for carrying smaller games, rule books or comic books.</p><h3>£40 - Bag of Holding</h3><p>You'll get your name immortalised on our website. You'll also get a bag of great merchandise including a founders mug, a set of Geek Within D6 dice, a dice bag and a t-shirt.</p><h3>£30 - Comic Book Subscription</h3><p>You'll get your name immortalised on our website. You'll also get a 12 issue comic book subscription starting after we've opened.</p><h3>£30 - Events Voucher</h3><p>You'll get your name immortalised on our website. You'll also get a £30 voucher to be put towards in store paid events such as tournaments or painting lessons.</p><h3>£125 - Pre Launch Party</h3><p>For our most dedicated of fans. You will be invited to store the night before the store's launch with a small number of others. You'll get a tour of the store, the chance to buy before anyone else, play some games and eat pizza! Lots of pizza. You'll also walk away with a Bag of Holding...with a few extras.</p><p>And of course you'll get your name immortalised on our website.</p><h2>Stretch Goals</h2><p>As mentioned above we made cuts to some of our plans in order to raise funds for our bigger store. These plans are still happening but will likely be further down the line after we've opened. We've decided to put these cuts as stretch goals if we meet our target.</p><h3>Stretch Goal 1 - £4,000</h3><p>TV and Video Equipment - As an alternative to music playing in store which can be surprisingly costly, a large screen TV will be mounted in store to play episodes of Critical Role, battle reports, game trailers, how-to-play videos and other episodes of your favourite YouTube shows. It will also be used to show episodic content we have produced ourselves!</p><p><strong>Purchases:</strong></p><ul>
<li>TV</li>
<li>Cabling and mount</li>
</ul><h3>Stretch Goal 2 - £6,500</h3><p>Video production hardware and software. This will be used to produce our very own set of videos to be added to YouTube and social media and will also allow us to stream content of our major events to Twitch.</p><p><strong>Purchases:</strong></p><ul>
<li>PC</li>
<li>Camera</li>
<li>Sony Vegas</li>
<li>Accessories</li>
</ul><p>More stretch goals will be revealed if these goals are met.</p><h2>In closing...</h2><p>As you can see, we have big plans and if we can get over this final hurdle we can bring this shop to Gloucester sooner and with your help we can make it bigger and better. We believe there is always room for improvement and will make every penny count.</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to read through this and if you pledge, thank you for being part of it.</p><p>Please, help us spread the word by sharing with your friends, family and on social media.</p><p>Hopefully we'll see you in store soon!</p><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Will there be a web store?</h3><p>Yes, but only once we've settled in our shop. Our focus will be, and always will be our bricks and mortar shop(s).</p><h3>When will you be open?</h3><p>It's hard to say, unfortunately we're at the mercy of the local rental market to find the perfect premises and we don't want to rush into it. Our goal is April but the sooner the better. We will of course be open in Gloucester's outdoor market from November 2017 until we find somewhere.</p><h3>Will you be stocking...?</h3><p>Probably, but if we don't, we'll be offering a free order in service. Essentially if we can source it, you'll be able to purchase it.</p><h3>What if the funding goal isn't met?</h3><p>This campaign won't be the end of us if the campaign isn't successful. You'll still see us on the high street. This campaign allows us to explore more options when searching for our premises, making  bigger and better and ultimately accelerating the process.</p><h3>Can I pledge more than once?</h3><p>Absolutely, however as Indiegogo does not support multiple pledges at once, each pledge must be processed separately. Simply make a pledge then return and make another as often as you like.</p><p> </p></div>","The Story So Far...Hi everyone!

You'll also walk away with a Bag of Holding...with a few extras.And of course you'll get your name immortalised on our website.Stretch GoalsAs mentioned above we made cuts to some of our plans in order to raise funds for our bigger store. These plans are still happening but will likely be further down the line after we've opened. We've decided to put these cuts as stretch goals if we meet our target.Stretch Goal 1 - £4,000TV and Video Equipment - As an alternative to music playing in store which can be surprisingly costly, a large screen TV will be mounted in store to play episodes of Critical Role, battle reports, game trailers, how-to-play videos and other episodes of your favourite YouTube shows. It will also be used to show episodic content we have produced ourselves!Purchases:
TV
Cabling and mount
Stretch Goal 2 - £6,500Video production hardware and software. This will be used to produce our very own set of videos to be added to YouTube and social media and will also allow us to stream content of our major events to Twitch.Purchases:
PC
Camera
Sony Vegas
Accessories
More stretch goals will be revealed if these goals are met.In closing...As you can see, we have big plans and if we can get over this final hurdle we can bring this shop to Gloucester sooner and with your help we can make it bigger and better. We believe there is always room for improvement and will make every penny count.Thank you for taking the time to read through this and if you pledge, thank you for being part of it.Please, help us spread the word by sharing with your friends, family and on social media.Hopefully we'll see you in store soon!FAQWill there be a web store?Yes, but only once we've settled in our shop. Our focus will be, and always will be our bricks and mortar shop(s).When will you be open?It's hard to say, unfortunately we're at the mercy of the local rental market to find the perfect premises and we don't want to rush into it. Our goal is April but the sooner the better. We will of course be open in Gloucester's outdoor market from November 2017 until we find somewhere.Will you be stocking...?Probably, but if we don't, we'll be offering a free order in service. Essentially if we can source it, you'll be able to purchase it.What if the funding goal isn't met?This campaign won't be the end of us if the campaign isn't successful. You'll still see us on the high street. This campaign allows us to explore more options when searching for our premises, making  bigger and better and ultimately accelerating the process.Can I pledge more than once?Absolutely, however as Indiegogo does not support multiple pledges at once, each pledge must be processed separately. Simply make a pledge then return and make another as often as you like.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Setting Up the Game</strong></p>
<p>Shuffle both decks of cards and keep face down. Spread the <strong>Cat Cards</strong> all over the table to form a ""cat herd"". Place the <strong>Draw Cards</strong> in a stack next to the cat herd.</p>
<p><strong>Playing the Game</strong></p>
<p>To start, each player adopts 3 random cats from the cat herd and places them face down on the table in front of them. Players then roll a dice to determine who starts the round. The player with the highest roll goes first and draws a card from the top of the <strong>Draw Deck</strong>.</p>
<p>If a tan <strong>Leg Up Card</strong> is drawn, keep it hidden from the other players and place it face down on the table in front of you with your adopted cats.

<h2>Dice Bottles is Relaunching!</h2>
<p>We've been working away in the background preparing to relaunch our products since our success on <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1272298803/dice-bottles-dnd-5e-healing-potion-kit?ref=indigogoDicebottles"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kickstarter</a>.  I was nearly ready to relaunch when Covid-19 became a reality in the United States.  I realized I could help by doing a donation drive with my relaunch and raise funds founds for charities providing medical supplies and support in response to Covid-19. </p>
<p><strong>All profits from this campaign will be donated. </strong></p>
<p>In the process of resupplying for my relaunch I have a stock of factory second starter vials that I'm offering through this campaign. They have a more rustic appearance with scratches, small chips, and other imperfections.  Those not wanting factory seconds will be able to purchase through my normal store when it's open. </p>
<p><strong><i>ALL </i>profits</strong> from this campaign will be evenly split between these three charities:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Direct Relief</strong> -<a href=""https://www.directrelief.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> https://www.directrelief.org/</a>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Project C.U.R.E - </strong><a href=""https://projectcure.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://projectcure.org/</a>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Extra Life</strong> - Benefiting Dell Children's Medical Center of Central Texas </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Dice Bottles Starter Kit Vials</h3>
<p>The Starter Vials are a single vial containing 10 d4 blood red dice with gold lettering and an ornate label with the formulas for all the health potions in Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition.  Bring the game to life by having such a realistic prop for your table to use! </p>
<p>This campaign will be using factory seconds and you should expect small blemishes. You will be able to find unblemished versions in our store when it launches (soon!). </p>
<p>You will receive it as a kit (label and dice). </p>

<h3>The Clerics need our help! </h3>
<p>It is with great sadness that I bring to your attention a realm mirroring our own that is in dire need of the heroic efforts of pauper and duke alike. In this strange realm my magical skills and talents were unusable, and a plague like none I had seen before was ravaging their kingdoms. They have a magic of their own, but the plague was laying claim to more victims and surpassing the constitutions of the realm's considerable army of clerics. They wore a curious armour into battle with the fiend, and it was with horror that I learned why: the plague was invisible to all, and no spell would uncover it. They were forced to fight this invisible villain knowing that if it landed the smallest of blows against them they themselves would be subject to it’s devious curses. Their armor smiths were overtaxed as any armour that was even touched by the enemy became it’s weapon, and would require all armour to be destroyed if any of it were thought to have been cursed.

</div></div>","Dice Bottles is Relaunching!
We've been working away in the background preparing to relaunch our products since our success on Kickstarter.  I was nearly ready to relaunch when Covid-19 became a reality in the United States.  I realized I could help by doing a donation drive with my relaunch and raise funds founds for charities providing medical supplies and support in response to Covid-19. 
All profits from this campaign will be donated. 
In the process of resupplying for my relaunch I have a stock of factory second starter vials that I'm offering through this campaign. They have a more rustic appearance with scratches, small chips, and other imperfections.  Those not wanting factory seconds will be able to purchase through my normal store when it's open. 
ALL profits from this campaign will be evenly split between these three charities:


Direct Relief - https://www.directrelief.org/


Project C.U.R.E - https://projectcure.org/


Extra Life - Benefiting Dell Children's Medical Center of Central Texas 

 

Dice Bottles Starter Kit Vials
The Starter Vials are a single vial containing 10 d4 blood red dice with gold lettering and an ornate label with the formulas for all the health potions in Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition.  Bring the game to life by having such a realistic prop for your table to use! 
This campaign will be using factory seconds and you should expect small blemishes. You will be able to find unblemished versions in our store when it launches (soon!). 
You will receive it as a kit (label and dice). 

 
The Clerics need our help! 
It is with great sadness that I bring to your attention a realm mirroring our own that is in dire need of the heroic efforts of pauper and duke alike. In this strange realm my magical skills and talents were unusable, and a plague like none I had seen before was ravaging their kingdoms. They have a magic of their own, but the plague was laying claim to more victims and surpassing the constitutions of the realm's considerable army of clerics. They wore a curious armour into battle with the fiend, and it was with horror that I learned why: the plague was invisible to all, and no spell would uncover it. They were forced to fight this invisible villain knowing that if it landed the smallest of blows against them they themselves would be subject to it’s devious curses. Their armor smiths were overtaxed as any armour that was even touched by the enemy became it’s weapon, and would require all armour to be destroyed if any of it were thought to have been cursed. I watched as their wise and fragile were taken, and I am moved to compassion and action on their behalf. I am coming to you with an opportunity to help. I have found that we can direct our charges of energy into the aether and with that I am able to convert that to their coinage. They have guilds that will be able to use those funds to provide for their clerics and others suffering from the effects of this plague. In return for your magics and energy I will be providing one of my excellent potions.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Kendall and soon I will graduate college with a Bachelors degree in Art and a Minor in Game Design. I have been assigned with the task of creating a tabletop game that will be made into a physical game in the spring! The game will be a card game where musclebound men from different time periods compete in a bodybuilding competition. </p>
<p>I'm raising money to commission the artist Icemanblue to do the artwork for the game.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Game Story:</h2>
<p>Hi! It’s me! NiceNasty! And I’m back with my great old pal Uncledaddy. So I won’t waste any time with todays wacky adventure. The other day I was reading some Muscle and Fitness Magazines and I said to myself, “Why don’t we have a bodybuilding contest of our very own?”.  Then I thought “It would be unorthodox to go around kidnapping random bodybuilders”, so I’ve built this time machine so we can go back in time to *ahem* “recruit” some beefy Barbarians, Spartans, Tribesmen, Greek Warriors you name it! Are you ready!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>The Game</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<h1>What comes with the game?</h1>
<p> </p>
<h3>Cards:</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507904893/qby5fryj2fjdet2ktqsz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Player Cards: Cards featuring the character with their stats and bio.</p>
<p>Posing Cards: Cards that display poses, used during main rounds to rack up points.</p>
<p>Power Ups: Cards that could give the hunk a boost. These cards can be earned from getting a full ego meter or bought with currency earned from the main rounds during rest periods.</p>
<p>Relationship Cards: Cards that are drawn to help you build a relationship with your hunk. These cards cost currency earned from the main rounds and can be bought during rest periods.</p>
<p>Event Cards: Cards that are drawn during rest periods. These events can heavily alter the competition or even lead to the death of one or more players.</p>
<p>Wrestling Cards: Cards that are used during Wrestling Battles.</p>
<h2>Gameplay:</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507847291/xsvsjti91m1txhmrptjm.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The game will be for 2-4 players. Each player gets to select their beefcake. Each beefcake has their own bio and stats.</p>
<h3>Rounds:</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507864769/uaf9vablfoprbmjmx3lu.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>All participating men are on stage.  Each player draws 4 posing cards. Each card has a number assigned to it for how effective it is. In each phase all participating players will pick a card and place it facedown. When all players have placed down their cards they will each reveal them. The highest scoring player wins. Depending on the events of each phase and the stats of each character, points can be added or deducted from their pose. There are 10 phases in a round and 5 rounds altogether.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Testosterone System:</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507845783/xnkybrsyfb6zevd717tq.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>If a hunk gets the lowest points in 2 posing phases consecutively, their testosterone meter will rise. Their testosterone meter will keep rising until this combo is broken. If the testosterone meter gets full, then that hunk must battle a hunk of his choice activating a wrestling game. After the wrestling game, the testosterone meter will go back to empty.</p>
<h3>Ego System:</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507845899/zbjtr9w413zkviu1ot7q.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>If a hunk gets the highest points in 2 posing phases consecutively, their ego meter will rise. Their ego meter will keep rising until this combo is broken. The higher their ego meter, the more bonus points they will get on each pose. If the ego meter gets full, the hunk gets a free solo pose, then the meter goes back to empty.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Relationship System:</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507846145/gcsqw7exi1qt3zwpitnb.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>When you build a relationship with your hunk, your relationship meter will rise depending on the event depicted on the card. Be aware that the higher the relationship meter is for your hunk, the more points will be deducted from his posing routine, seeing as he is not fully focused on the competition. He can, however, come to your aid and rescue during events depending on how high his relationship meter is.</p>
<h3>Wrestling System:</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507846351/ddzhuxyis4oazdhuoxpn.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>When a wrestling game starts, each participating player must draw 4 wrestling cards. The wrestling cards display a wrestling move and how powerful it is. Players will place their cards facedown and turn them around to reveal their move. The hunks stats will alter how effective to move is. Whoever wins the most phases wins the wrestling match and the loser must sit out for the next phase.</p>
<h3>Health System:</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507846452/c4ucxquhvrasiglnxorr.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>A hunk can take damage during a wrestling game or during an event. If a hunk loses all of their health, they must sit out for a whole round. Hunks can heal themselves through Power ups, events, and relationship cards</p>
<h3>Rest Period:</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507846590/hypokzs1rcofmfnt5j3w.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Rest periods take place between rounds so there are 3 in total. Each player can use their currency to buy power ups and relationship cards. After everyone has bought their cards, each player must draw an event card and watch the events unfold.</p>
<h3>The hunk with the most points at the end of round 5 wins the prize.</h3>
<p> </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>If I recieve 2000$, 1800$ will go to commissioning Icemanblue to creating the characters, card artwork and cover art for the game. The other 200$ will go toward putting the game together through <a href=""https://www.thegamecrafter.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.thegamecrafter.com/</a>.</p>

<h3>In Brief:</h3>
<p>I'm a writer, game designer, and longtime fan of tabletop gaming. Train to Hell draws on a scenario I originally devised as a Halloween-themed tabletop RPG adventure, redesigned as a self-contained experience; a fun board game that won't take hours to learn, or set up, or to play, with clear goals and stakes set by a theme of supernatural peril, without leaning too hard into an atmosphere of fear or horror.</p>
<p>It's not enough for a board game's rules to be fun; to help players engage, artwork is hugely important - but it's not my forte. Train to Hell needs an artist!</p>
<p>We've all heard horror stories about people expecting art for free, in exchange for ""exposure"". Artists are workers; art is work. Train to Hell <i>will</i> pay its artist, but I'm not a monied patron of the arts - everyone benefits if I don't have to save up for years to do it!</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Every single penny raised will go directly to commission game art.</p>
<p>I'm asking for £1000. After service and payment processing fees, that works out as the bare minimum art budget to commission all the game components. If I raise more, then I can commission more and better art! If I raise less, finishing the game will be significantly delayed, as I commission the work a piece at a time, out of my own pocket, as and when I can afford to.</p>
<p>I'm still evaluating what the purchase price of the finished game will be, and how best to arrange backer rewards. The goal is to discount the price of the finished article for all backers, ideally up to 100% off for sufficiently generous contributions, but several other things need to be finalised before I'll know exactly how that will work.</p>
<p>(If you have suggestions about backer rewards and how you'd like them to work, please do get in touch!)</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div><p>Without funding, it may take several years for me to commission a sufficient quantity of art. With funding, not only can I make the project happen sooner, but I can immediately start giving paid work to a freelance artist!</p></div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is my first physical board game. As crowdfunding backers are now well aware, many projects stumble on the unexpected complexity, cost and sheer length of time it takes to manufacture physical items. Print-on-demand technology has removed many of these risks for producing books, and is increasingly available to other niche industries - including board games. I have identified a POD game manufacturer, and am evaluating Train to Hell's design in light of their catalogue of standard game components and costs.</p>
<p>Contracting work to freelancers raises the prospect of delays, miscommunication and dissatisfaction. The artist I have in mind for Train to Hell has a portfolio of previous work for hire, and I have commissioned work from them before, for other projects, on which we've had an excellent working relationship.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>As with any crowdfunding campaign: give what you can, if you can; and whether or not you can give, spread the word!</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Using gold in your villager's tile you can buy others right there. Choose consciously which one to buy, it can change the whole your tactics. The villagers are getting more expensive related to their powers so The Soldier costs 1 gold, The Thief 2 gold and The Wizard costs 3 gold.

<p>The Storm is the thing you must always be afraid of. Because of The Storm all villagers are running to the center. Each player, must move the storm counter, after finishing his turn. After each rotation of what we call a ""storm counter"", one layer of tiles closes, and the counter goes to the inner layer, and continues to move after each turn. Every villager or factory, which is located on the closing layer, will be destroyed when the layer closes.</p>

<h2>Our Apologies</h2>
<p>After having the game in our hands, some confusing situations happened to us. First of all we uploaded the game to Kickstarter and some misunderstandings happened related to the campaign, that were not understood correctly, and we couldn't do anything more. Now we accept all our mistakes and apologize for them and assure you that they will not be repeated.  We are grateful to all people who pointed to our mistakes. It is probable that there are ones who we are not trusted by but we will do our best to fix that. Thanks.</p>

<p>We are very grateful to all our backers, to those people, who have helped us to make this project real.</p>

Shipping costs 25$ for every country. We do NOT ship to these countries:the Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Iraq, Liberia, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Iran, Central African Republic, North Korea, Syria.The PriceA long time was spent to find quality manufacturing materials. The price is justified with quality materials for meeples, thick tiles, beautiful dice and hard box. Meeples and Factories' average height is 4.5 cm (~1.8 inches) and the thickness is 1 cm (~0.4 inches) and they stand very well. Tiles are from thick cardboard, the side of a tile is 8 cm (~3.2 inches) and the thickness is more than enough for comfortable playing. The sizes of the box are: 35 cm (~13.8 inches)  * 35 cm (~13.8 inches) * 7 cm (~3.2 inches) and weighs about 3 kg (~6.7 lbs). So that's why the shipping costs 25 USD, the shipping duration is 10-14 days after having the game produced. You can expect the game to arrive sooner. You are the last people of your village, and you have to survive. You are in the safe zone, which is becoming smaller and smaller due to a storm. In this matter of life and death you will fight enemies, wild animals, and you will face adventures and traps. You will need friends, smart tactics, and economical management skills.
 Catapult is a strong weapon for holding your positions and it can help you keep enemies at a distance. Charge it with a stone to shoot.
 The Tiger is an angry animal. Don't go by him alone, unless you want to die. He becomes afraid when you attack with a friend!
 The Horse is a very fast animal. It can give you a big advantage, but only if you use it smartly. You can slice your enemies while jumping on them with a horse.
 Aborigine is very dangerous. Don't try to visit him with your friend. He is afraid of nothing, and will eat both of you at once.

 The Abyss limits your way and creates an obstacle for your enemies too.Try to use it effectively and it can also help you, but stop your enemies in their tracks. 
 The Forest is dark and silent, but you can hear the guiding voices of others and must follow them. 
 The Pit can be critical for you, because when you fall, it takes time for you to climb, giving your enemies an advantage in giving them time to find and defeat you.
 The Trap is an unpleasant thing for an individual. Landing in a trap means that you cannot free yourself and must wait for a friend to come free you!

 The Stone is one of the many types of resources. 
 The Chest is a big treasure in a game. Finding it will give you resources that you need in game.
 The Road Sign is an effective way to move faster helping you make an escape from the enemy. Use it effectively and it can help you, but it can also bring you troubles.
 The Tunnel is the fastest way of moving through the map, because it sends you from one tile to another, helping attack enemies as you appear suddenly. Be careful as your enemy can use it and you'll end up being the victim.
And a lot of other cards that can be used as a part of your tactic!At the beginning of every game you get 2 soldiers. Soldiers can both kill enemies and build factories so he's the most economically important villager. He only has cold weapons, so he can only attack his neighbor enemy. You can only have 5 soldiers on your board at one time.Thief has no attack power but he can defend when he needs it. The thief moves twice as fast than other villagers and his main goal is to steal enemies' resources and keep them tense in anticipation.The Wizard is the most dangerous villager, because he has magic powers with which he can attack from afar. His disadvantage is that he can't fight in a close distance. Make sure to use the wizard from afar, because if you are close and your enemy attacks, the wizard will lose.Factory is a mean of getting resources. It can be placed only by a soldier, and only on an appropriate territory. To place a factory, villagers need to pay the mentioned amount of resources. The more soldiers you have building a factory, the less time it will take due to more manpower. To start a game you need to connect borders and place tiles inside borders. Then choose a color, take 2 soldiers, open the central tile of one of the sides of hexagon and place your soldiers on it. That tile is considered as a free space. It cannot harm you or be used in any way. Place the counter on one of the corners of hexagon, which will be the counting point. After finishing the preparation choose the first player by rolling the dice, the queue will be determined clockwise. The goal is to survive and be the last man standing. ​
 
Each of villagers can do one action in each turn. The actions are: moving to neighbor tile, buying another villager, killing enemy villagers. Villager can move only to neighbor tiles (the tile which has common side). He must open the unopened tile after moving on it, if the tile is not closed by the storm. He can also carry the resources with him to the new tile (maximal quantity of each resource is mentioned on villager’s section), but resources only of one type.
 
 
 
The best defense is attacking, so during the game you will appear in some situations where you have to kill your enemies. After death all the loot that was carried by dead villager stays on the appropriate tile, and it can be taken by other villagers.
 

 
One of the most important mechanics of the game is building factories. To build a factory you have to use appropriate amount of resources. The factories are the main resource sources and each factory has its own way of mining resources.  
 

 
The Polemos doesn't only make enemies from player, but also teaches you to make effective alliances. So you can exchange mined resources by demands.
 
 
During a game you can appear in irredeemable situations, in that case, unfortunately, your villager will die, sorry.
 

 
If villager stands on a safe zone he will immediately strengthen his positions so be careful not to appear in the enemy's tile, he can immediately kill you, as you are too close. Remember you don't want to lose any soldiers. 
 

 
One of the villagers can be caught in a trap during the game, but it's not a big trouble, another of yours can help him. 
 

 
If you open a chest tile, you must be happy. It's a great opportunity to get extra gold for your army. Gold is the most expensive and hard to mine resource so try to spend it reasonably.
 

 
Using gold in your villager's tile you can buy others right there. Choose consciously which one to buy, it can change the whole your tactics. The villagers are getting more expensive related to their powers so The Soldier costs 1 gold, The Thief 2 gold and The Wizard costs 3 gold. If you have more than 2 villagers in the game, you will have to pay bread to feed them. 
 

 
It's a good fortune to find a catapult in your way. You shoot it with stone and you can defend your positions with it. The Catapult is the most powerful weapon in the game, as you can kill all the enemies standing on one tile.
 

 
If you passed through all the obstacles of the land , fought with deadly enemies and stayed the last man standing, congratulations you won the game. The Polemos is for people who appreciate the entertainment. Good Luck!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Thanks for checking out this project!  </strong> </p>
<p>When was the last time you had an actual conversation with your friends? What do you know about their hopes and dreams, their most cherished memory, the one thing you can wake them up for in the middle of the night, or how they would spend their last day on earth? We are so caught up in our own lives, with our phone in hand, that we seem to forget to connect with the people that are right in front of us. About things that matter to us. With these cards, you can put your phone away and start listening to each other and reconnect. You will never run out of topics to talk about anymore and you will learn a great deal about the hopes, dreams, drives, fears, motivations and habits of your conversation partners. Whether you have known them for years or you just met! </p>
<p><strong>Let's put our phones away and have a meaningful conversation.</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes, when I'm around people, it's just a habit to scroll through my phone aimlessly. Diverting my attention to my phone seems to be easier. And other times, I simply don't know what to talk about. And I dislike meaningless small talk. So I decided to do something about this!  </p>
<p><strong>Simple, elegant, light-weight card deck. Easy to carry around.</strong></p>
<p>I came up with over 200 questions that aims to dive deeper into one's personality, figuring out what shaped their story, how they work the way they work and what makes them tick. I culled the questions to 100, which will offer plenty of conversational topics for a long time! Putting them together in a simple card deck allows people to carry the cards around wherever they go. It's an easy conversation starter and doesn't take up much space.</p>
<p><strong>There are no rules. Just questions. </strong></p>
<p>You can choose whether you play this game with two people or twenty, whether everyone has to answer the same question you draw, or whether someone draws a different question for someone else to answer. You can use a couple of questions as inspiration for a conversation or you can decide to tackle all 100 (and make it a very long day/night!). You can do anything you like. Just start picking up a question and (re)connect with the people around you! Let's put the phone away and engage with each other, face-to-face, whenever we can.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The funds raised will help to start production of the cards. I want to print 500 decks of cards for which I received a quote for $1800. Other costs involved are costs for the boxes (around $300) and promotion costs. You will help me greatly if you could support me to reach at least half to start production! As a backer, you will receive one of the printed decks.</p>
<p>Dimensions of the cards are 56 x 87mm, with a gloss finish on 300 gsm card board. The cards will be delivered in a box containing 50 cards each. Production will start end of May, with the first batch ready to be dispatched early June. Depending on your country, it may take up to three or four weeks to get delivered via standard postage. </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div><p>My aim is to get people more connected and realize we have so much more in common together than we think. Really listening to someone else's story is one of the best gifts you can give someone. And this card game will help start this! </p></div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I've been in contact with a few printers, and have printed three prototypes. None of the prototypes were completely satisfactory and according to my standards and my design. The risk here is that the quality will not live up to my standards. I am getting there with one of the suppliers, but it is a process. Meaning that the first batch that will be printed could contain some errors. The last error that was made, was solely double printing of some questions. The card itself, the size, the colour and the design was printed as specified. So we're getting there! This might mean that the cards might take a bit longer to be produced than anticipated.</p>

<p>MAGE Company is a board game publisher based in Greece and Bulgaria. The company was created back in 2010 for the purpose of creating new and exciting board games. Since then MAGE Company has published a variety of titles such as 12 Realms, Wrong Chemistry, Hoyuk, Raid &amp; Trade, Res Publica: 2230AD, Carrotia, the Cohort and more. You can check more info for our board games on our official profile at Board Game Geek here.</p>
<p>The company is growing step by step, building new partnerships with well known publishers and distributors, like Edge Entertainment, Heidelberger, Ninja Division, Redbox, TenDays, BrainTeasers, Chaos Publishing, Blackfire and more. Recently we published a new line of products, the MCG Premium Sleeves that you can find available in our shop. We will keep growing this line by adding new sleeve sizes in order to cover most of the games of the market. Currently we offer 14 different sleeve types including the matte ones. Among them and unique sleeves for games like Kingdom Death, the mini square sleeves, and the special ones.</p>

<p>MAGE Company develops and publishes games that offer a different playing experience and always supports the main titles with news expansions that enrich the games with new mechanics.  Following the standards of the marker, each board game includes components of high quality. Few titles are published each year, each with its own style, theme, and mechanics. Our priority is to keep a very special line of board, card and miniature games. Our current titles are divided in two different parts: the Family Zone and the Original Games.  We build our lines based on games for the kids and families and for those who are more experienced gamers.</p>

<p><strong>4 out of 5 by Michael / Square Sleeves</strong>: “I love these sleeves, they are the best! I use these for my kingdom death gear cards, they work awesomely, as everyone says. ""  </p>
<p><strong>5 out of 5 by Greg Kliffel / Dream Sleeves</strong>: “I spent months searching for sleeves that would work with the gear cards for Kingdom Death. The sleeves sold by other sites were either too flimsy, too sticky, or cut to weird and irregular sizes. Enter Mage Company. These sleeves are perfect. They are good quality sleeves that don't stick, are cut evenly, and hold the card in place rather than letting it slide out when transitioning from box to table like some others did.”  </p>
<p><strong>4 out of 5 by Robert / Best at this size</strong>: “I bought a bunch of these for Kingdom Death's 52mm square gear cards. They're definitely the best sleeves I've seen at this size. I had previously purchased similar sleeves, but they were the same thickness as penny sleeves and they stuck together a lot. Neither of these are issues with Mage Company's. I'm very pleased with the ones I bought here.”  </p>
<p><strong>4 out of 5 by Lee Martin</strong>: ""Amazing card sleeves, these are the ones that Kingdom Death gear cards will fit into.""  </p>
<p><strong>Chengkai Yang</strong>: I can also vouch for Mage Co. I had some issues with the initial order as I placed it during Essen and they were swamped. They got my sleeves to me in like 2 weeks from Germany after that was settled. Amazing customer service and the product works. They're FFG quality in terms of thickness and feel. A few of the packs were a bit tighter than others but all my KDM gear is now sleeved! I just need to make a custom insert now because of how much room the sleeves took up.  </p>
<p><strong>Seth Stewart</strong>: I will also vouch for Mage Co. I really like the sleeves. I would say in about 5 packs, I'v only found maybe 2-3 sleeves that were slightly miscut. I have yet to open them all; I bought a lot. I am very pleased so far.</p>

<li>Players take turns determined by the leadership value on their player board. </li>
<li>Take up to two actions on your turn. </li>
<li>Each player board has its own special abilities to utilize! </li>
<li>Any time a player moves in to a new room that tile is flipped face up and a number of events cards are drawn and resolved. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Any time a player encounters enemies their turn ends and they will enter combat at the end of the round. </li>
<li>At the end of each full round the Apprehension Track is moved up, new corridors and rooms are placed and the enemy defenders will move about the ship seeking out the intruders!</li>

<p>To win, as a group you must meet the requirements of the Primary Mission AND each player must meet the requirements of their own personal goal.</p>
<p><strong>Just like the cold, dark emptiness of outer space, Into the Black: Boarding Party is harsh and unforgiving;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If, at any time during the game, the apprehension track reaches 24, morale reaches zero or there are no more character boards left to select from the game ends in a loss for all of the players.</li>

<p>Last, but definitely not least, let's not forget our play testers! You spent hundreds of tireless hours playing and breaking this game in order to help us make it what it is today!</p>
<p> </p>
</div></div>","Board an enemy star ship, loot and plunder, complete your objectives and survive!
Take on the role a fierce band of space pirates who have boarded an enemy vessel, set on accomplishing your mission while each pirate also has their own secret goal to fulfill.
Explore and loot the vessel of its bounty, fend off a seemingly unending wave of enemy defenders and encounter a potentially lethal series of events around every corner; All this while keeping morale high as the clock ticks down to your potential capture. 
Be wary of the possible traitor lurking among you, out for personal glory at the expense of the rest of the crew! 

Will you make it off the ship with all of your goals accomplished and your crew intact? Find out in Into the Black: Boarding Party!


Quick Player Turns - With 2 actions per turn it will be your turn again in no time! 

Re-playable -  10+ player boards,14 personal goals, 7 primary missions and a completely modular game board mean no two games are likely to be quite the same! 

Semi Cooperative - Players must work together to complete the primary mission while also dealing with their own personal goal, complete with the possibility of a traitor in your midst!

No Player Elimination - Everyone is in the game to the end! 

Solo Play Integrated - With a complete enemy AI system, Into the Black: Boarding Party is fully playable solo, by design!
The first in a SERIES of Games - Into the Black: Boarding Party is the first in a series of games in the Game of Space Piracy world, with a prequel and a sequel game currently in development!


Each player selects a Player Board to represent the crew member they are playing, equips that character and selects their secret personal goal, one of which may be a Traitor!

A Primary Mission is then selected, for the entire group to complete.
Place the Airlock and initial set of corridors and rooms tiles and you are ready to play!

A Typical 2 Player Setup

Players take turns determined by the leadership value on their player board. 
Take up to two actions on your turn. 
Each player board has its own special abilities to utilize! 
Any time a player moves in to a new room that tile is flipped face up and a number of events cards are drawn and resolved. 

 

Any time a player encounters enemies their turn ends and they will enter combat at the end of the round. 
At the end of each full round the Apprehension Track is moved up, new corridors and rooms are placed and the enemy defenders will move about the ship seeking out the intruders!

To win, as a group you must meet the requirements of the Primary Mission AND each player must meet the requirements of their own personal goal.
Just like the cold, dark emptiness of outer space, Into the Black: Boarding Party is harsh and unforgiving;

If, at any time during the game, the apprehension track reaches 24, morale reaches zero or there are no more character boards left to select from the game ends in a loss for all of the players.
If, at any time during the game, the traitor completes and plays their personal goal, the traitor has won the game and all other players have lost!

<p>A real thing of exclusive artwork. We desired to create something a bit more rare, giving Cardists something more meaningful.

<p>The unique feature of this deck is one-of-a-kind fantasy story style and highly complicated and advanced hand-drawing.</p>
<p>We wanted to add this touch for enthusiasts, collectors, cardists, and of course illusionists. </p>

ARISTO STEAMPUNK PLAYING CARDS is a brand-new project that was inspired by XIXcentury industrial steam-powered machinery & American “Wild West” fantasy world. Steampunk today can be defined in multiple ways, however, aesthetic can lead to some truly breathtaking designs. That’s why we've put together some awesome ideas of Steampunk in art and playing cards, that really epitomize its incredible style. 



 
What the past would look like if the future had happened sooner ?!

Let us introduce a modern science fiction deck of playing cards with 54 STEAMPUNK themed retro-futuristic drawings!
A real thing of exclusive artwork. We desired to create something a bit more rare, giving Cardists something more meaningful. It's all about mixing old and new: fusing the usability of modern technology with the design aesthetic and philosophy of the Victorian age. Welcome to the mysterious and breathtaking world of Steampunk.

♠️ The Court Cards follow the characters in Steampunk outfit with heavy gun, bowler hat, goggle and military-inspired garments that have been anticipated by mainstream high fashion, the Lolita and Aristocrat styles.

♦️ The Pips combine elements of technofantasy imagery in mechanical ""steampunk"" style. Aspects of such dim & dark design emphasise a balance between form and function that fantasized US Wild West-era gadgets.









♥️ The ACEs are decorated in clockwork mechanism style with spiral springs and set of gears details. Such graphic design makes every single card unique and interesting thing.

 
The JOKER card is a presentation of the distinctive ""look"" of a Plague Doctor. And depicting the most extraordinary part of the costume, The Mask.

Charismatic & Magnetic 
But it’s not for the fearsome appearance, the plague doctor might has been considered a Hero and in many ways represents superstition over science.
We look at the mask as some sort of adornment! 

It is remarkable! 
♣️ The Back Side of the cards is a wall piece that represents the concept of the clockwork mechanism. At some point, this is the level of sophistication in technology that once was lost or forgotten. The clockwork holding the various metal pieces together really adds to the Steampunk aesthetic as well making this one an eye catching piece of art.
We are extremely proud of the card back design. It’s exceptionally detailed!

 
The unique feature of this deck is one-of-a-kind fantasy story style and highly complicated and advanced hand-drawing.
We wanted to add this touch for enthusiasts, collectors, cardists, and of course illusionists. 
The goal of this project is to employ appropriate elements (such as iron, wood, and leather) with specifically designed concept and craftsmanship. To present SteamPunk in a completely imaginary realm coexisting with steam-era and other anachronistic technologies.
