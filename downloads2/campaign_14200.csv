<p><b>A FEW THINGS ABOUT ME AND THIS BOOK</b></p><p>I love my work, and I'm very lucky that I get to draw for a living. Even so, I still dream everyday of creating my own personal <b>Art Book</b>. For a few months now, I have been drawing a lot in the night time. Every time brings something different, something new, characters, color sketches, illustrations, but somewhere there's a pattern. Every one of these drawings is a mood, a sensation, rage toward someone or myself, a song I was listening to, a dream or just an image stacked in my head. I tried to put all those feelings in colors. It is the sublimation of my different states of mind.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/402029/files/20140301003330-tumblr_mzyuy56Vc71s41aogo1_1280.jpg?1393662810"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/402050/files/20140301005024-tumblr_mkd0zkxEqK1s41aogo1_1280.jpg?1393663824"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p>
<p><b>TO MAKE THINGS CLEAR FOR EVERYBODY</b></p>

I can share my process, give you advice on your work if you are an amateur and want to become a professional, or if you just want to improve as an artist. If you love art then we’re already friends!</p>
<p>During the day, I work as a comic artist. All the illustrations for Nocturne are created in the night time, so please back me and help me to stay awake and paint more ! With your contribution I can realize my dream to share a part of me with all of you.</p>
<p>I already have about <b>75 images</b>, and my target is to get to <b>100</b>. If you back me you should also know that some of the money will go to a young designer who’s helping me with all the layout work to design the book, the cover, and the few writing parts.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/402034/files/20140301003533-Bus_stop_copy.jpg?1393662933"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p>

There's much more information on the website for the project, <a href=""http://www.thefirelightisle.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">The Firelight Isle.com</a><br/><br/>My goal for The Firelight Isle is to produce a graphic novel without compromises, and put every ounce of quality that I can into the story, the art and the design. The finished product will be a 200-300 page full-colour comic, with production values inspired by beautiful publications like <a href=""http://www.habibibook.com/about/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">Habibi </a>and <a href=""http://www.shauntan.net/books/the-arrival.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">The Arrival</a>, in which every detail of the book contributes to the atmosphere of the story. In order to achieve this, I'll be focussing intently on the writing, research, design and thumbnailing before I move onto the production of the pages themselves. I plan to document this creation process online, putting up notes, sketches, designs and illustrations as I go! You can already see the first few entries on <a href=""http://www.firelightisle.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">The Firelight Isle Blog</a>, and there's more detail about how much time each aspect of the creative process takes on the Creative Process page of <a href=""http://www.thefirelightisle.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">thefirelightisle.com</a>.<br/><br/>I'm estimating that the pre-production stage (writing, research, design and thumbnailing) will take me around 80-100 days of full time work, and the production stage (drawing and colouring the pages) will take between 400-900 days of full time work, depending on how long the project ends up being, and how smoothly it goes! As it stands I can only afford spend one day a week on <a href=""http://www.thefirelightisle.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">The Firelight Isle</a>, and at that pace it could take up to two years to finish the pre-production, and over a decade to finish the production! This is where you come in...<br/>I'm self-employed, and earn enough from doing commercial artwork to make a living, but unfortunately there is very little money out there for creator owned comics. At the moment, every day I spend working on The Firelight Isle is a day during which I don't earn any income, and this is a big financial risk - but your input can help change that!<br/><br/>I'm looking for funding to help me complete the pre-production stage of this project - the goal is $6000, which on the current dollar-pound exchange rate works out at around minimum wage for 100 days work, 8 hours a day - just enough! That still leaves the matter of funding for the production itself, but I have a feeling that's too substantial a goal for crowd-sourcing (even at minimum wage and fastest possible production time, that would require about $25000 on top of the $6000 I'm asking for). After the pre-production is finished, I plan on using the collected concept work to seek more substantial funding from publishers, or perhaps to launch a second campaign using the interest gathered if this first campaign is successful. This also means that any money I raise for the project above the target or 
outside this campaign will go straight towards funding the production stage.<br/><br/>So, what's in it for you?<br/><br/><ul>
<li>I can promise a great comic in return! I'm dedicated to getting this finished, whether it takes 3 years or 30, and having delivered 144 episodes of <a href=""http://www.freakangels.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">Freakangels </a>at an average of 4 weeks out of every 5, you can be sure that I've got the dedication it requires!</li>
<li>You'll get to watch the project develop faster! I'll be posting my progress online, and with every new contributor, I can produce more material to share each week.</li>
<li>You'll be helping to back creator owned comics! Whether it's self-published or not, I intend to add The Firelight Isle to the ever growing list of creator owned material and support that sector of the industry in my own way.</li>
<li>I also want to be totally up front with every aspect of this project because I know how easy it is to mislead with crowd-funding campaigns. I will be completely open with where your money goes and what it helps me achieve!</li>
<li>And of course there are the perks! At this stage it's worth explaining that I can't offer free copies of the finished book to any but the biggest of contributors because I don't yet know who will be publishing or how much the book will cost to print and post, but hopefully the other perks will make up for this!</li>

The finished product will be a 200-300 page full-colour comic, with production values inspired by beautiful publications like Habibi and The Arrival, in which every detail of the book contributes to the atmosphere of the story. In order to achieve this, I'll be focussing intently on the writing, research, design and thumbnailing before I move onto the production of the pages themselves. I plan to document this creation process online, putting up notes, sketches, designs and illustrations as I go! You can already see the first few entries on The Firelight Isle Blog, and there's more detail about how much time each aspect of the creative process takes on the Creative Process page of thefirelightisle.com.I'm estimating that the pre-production stage (writing, research, design and thumbnailing) will take me around 80-100 days of full time work, and the production stage (drawing and colouring the pages) will take between 400-900 days of full time work, depending on how long the project ends up being, and how smoothly it goes! As it stands I can only afford spend one day a week on The Firelight Isle, and at that pace it could take up to two years to finish the pre-production, and over a decade to finish the production! This is where you come in...I'm self-employed, and earn enough from doing commercial artwork to make a living, but unfortunately there is very little money out there for creator owned comics. At the moment, every day I spend working on The Firelight Isle is a day during which I don't earn any income, and this is a big financial risk - but your input can help change that!I'm looking for funding to help me complete the pre-production stage of this project - the goal is $6000, which on the current dollar-pound exchange rate works out at around minimum wage for 100 days work, 8 hours a day - just enough! That still leaves the matter of funding for the production itself, but I have a feeling that's too substantial a goal for crowd-sourcing (even at minimum wage and fastest possible production time, that would require about $25000 on top of the $6000 I'm asking for). After the pre-production is finished, I plan on using the collected concept work to seek more substantial funding from publishers, or perhaps to launch a second campaign using the interest gathered if this first campaign is successful. This also means that any money I raise for the project above the target or 
outside this campaign will go straight towards funding the production stage.So, what's in it for you?
I can promise a great comic in return! I'm dedicated to getting this finished, whether it takes 3 years or 30, and having delivered 144 episodes of Freakangels at an average of 4 weeks out of every 5, you can be sure that I've got the dedication it requires!
You'll get to watch the project develop faster! I'll be posting my progress online, and with every new contributor, I can produce more material to share each week.
You'll be helping to back creator owned comics! Whether it's self-published or not, I intend to add The Firelight Isle to the ever growing list of creator owned material and support that sector of the industry in my own way.
I also want to be totally up front with every aspect of this project because I know how easy it is to mislead with crowd-funding campaigns. I will be completely open with where your money goes and what it helps me achieve!
And of course there are the perks! At this stage it's worth explaining that I can't offer free copies of the finished book to any but the biggest of contributors because I don't yet know who will be publishing or how much the book will cost to print and post, but hopefully the other perks will make up for this!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</p><p><b>Okay,
what’s this about?</b></p>
<p><b>Gundeath Carnival </b>(血液爆発超暴力！ガンデスカーニバル ~Oblivion
Nightmare Megakill Fantasia XXIII~ lit. <i>BLOOD
EXPLOSION ULTRA VIOLENCE! GUNDEATH CARNIVAL ~Oblivion Nightmare Megakill
Fantasia XXIII~</i>) is an action web manga about the virtual reality first
person shooter (VRFPS) Gundeath Carnival, a game that, in the year 2027, ended
all armed conflict all over the globe and turned all international territorial
and resource conflicts into the world’s biggest E-Sport.</p>
<p>I intend for the manga to be a biweekly serial released on Batoto,
Tapastic and MangaMagazine, with 20-30 pages every fortnight. The reason for me
not considering a weekly schedule is because I am also a Computer Science
major in university, and the weekly mangaka schedule (according to current
working conditions) is too hectic to allow more than one day without work. As
for <i>“why not monthly,”</i> I’d like to
remain motivated enough to consistently put out good stuff, and a monthly
schedule would force me into a ridiculously slow working pace that could potentially
lead to a loss of interest and motivation. I don’t like that. That’s bad.</p>
<p><b>What’s with the
ridiculously over-the-top title? <br/></b></p>
<p>The alternate version of the title is an affectionate parody of ridiculously
long Japanese visual culture titles such as “<i>The Society for the Study of Modern Visual Culture</i>”, “<em>This Is the Police Station in Front of Kameari
Park in Katsushika Ward”, and “No Matter How I Look at It, It's You Guys' Fault
I'm Not Popular!”. Following in the footsteps of over-the-top anime and manga
series such as “Heaven-Piercing Gurren-Lagann”, “Mobile Fighter G Gundam” and
“Kill La Kill”, <b>Gundeath Carnival</b></em> aims to be as ridiculously over-the-top as over-the-top can be,
while retaining its serious undertones and relevant themes.</p><p><b>Do you promote violence or something?</b><br/></p>
<p>The manga does not, in any
way, promote or glorify violence - as a matter of fact, I aim to drive the
following points: WAR IS BAD, INTERNATIONAL CONFLICTS ARE VERY BAD, and SPORTS
IS THE BEST WAY TO UNITE THE WORLD. By doing away with the concept of armed
international conflicts and providing a viable alternative, the ‘world
government’ aims to establish unity and peace throughout the world. Of course,
such an ideal solution reaching its best conclusion would be unrealistic; this
web manga aims to tackle, among others, the following issues:</p>
<p><em>Violence (specifically gun violence)</em></p>
<p><em>Corruption</em></p>
<p><em>Sportsmanship and unity</em></p>
<p><em>Gamer culture (and a subset, the ‘bro culture’)</em></p>
<p><em>Virtual reality and its implications</em></p>
<p>This may seem like a lot to tackle, but I’m
hopeful that I will be able to carry my points across through this story. Being
a gamer myself, a lot of the themes of this manga are a product of my
experiences playing first person shooters, real-time strategy games and
massively multiplayer online games, so there’s definitely a lot of things that
hit close to home. </p>
<p><b>So what do you
need the money for?</b></p>In order to resume my work on the comics, and to improve my workflow by
mixing digital and traditional elements, I will need to gather $1500 to upgrade my current desktop computer and purchase a new graphics tablet. I'll also be using the money to obtain comic paper, pen nibs and inks.<br/><p>Should the funding break through the initial goal, I

<p><br/><br/><em><strong>What is this graphic novel about? Allow me to narrate!</strong></em><br/><br/><em>In a post-apocalyptic 2018, a man who wears a horse mask, Dawn Horse, is bent on protecting a herd of horses from savage flesh-eaters, called Scavers, while trying to make a meaningful life in a world that has stopped. As the herd of horses strive to understand what Dawn Horse teaches them and how they must learn from their surroundings amongst themselves. To survive without pride, to live with heart than with malice.</em><br/><br/><em>How things came to be from such a time while not perfect but very free and prosperous, turned grey and deathly silent, those who survive live on with the lives they have to survive, even if that means to turn to a dark place which you may never return from to do so, or maybe you do choose to be a guardian to protect those you care about even if there are always consequences.</em><br/><br/>If that plot doesn't make you scream ""Holy crap! That sounds amazingly interesting, original, dark, emotional and awesome"" then I don't know what will!<br/><br/>You'll find 20 unfinished pages here that I know will wet your appetite!

<p><em><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></em><br/><br/>I have estimated the amount to cover the printing costs and the cover artist will be <strong><span class=""amount notranslate"">$2390</span></strong>.<br/><br/>You see that I set the goal at <strong>$2570</strong>, that's because of the site fees. What I'll be getting is just a little bit over <span class=""amount notranslate"">$2390</span>, if we don't make the goal then the fees will be higher. Mainly the site's fees establish that if we succeed the goal they get 4%, if I don't reach my goal then they get 9%. <br/><br/>All <strong>$2020</strong> of your awesome contributions will go straight into the printing costs for the book and <strong>$370</strong> of it will go to pay a fellow artist to make the cover of the book and it's going to look beautiful as the story itself. I'll start with printing up to 370 books, it's a good start and what I'll make back from sales will go into more prints of this story, have to keep it going. :) Plus, I'll be writing a sequel book this Winter and get started on it late 2014.<br/><br/>If I get more than my estimated goal, I'll put that extra money into some lamination work and promotion for the book!<br/><br/><em><strong>What do you get out of all this?

However, I will engage you on a personal discussion about why I'm making this story and why it's important to me.<br/><br/><em>First, the Nice reasons!</em><br/><br/>As I said before, I love Horses. It was something that was living in the back of my mind for a long time and haven't really come to full grips with it until just a few years back. Coming to know these proud beasts, big or small, different kinds, different colors, different personalities, an animal that builds a trust and a loving friendship that can last longer than forever. I love their anatomy, I love how you can read them, I love how they're misunderstood by some people as being stupid when they're most definitely not, the long faces, fluffy ears, voluptuously-strong bodies, their cute but awesome hooves, their flowing manes and tails, their neighs are music to my ears...<br/><br/>...I told you I love them. I'm looking on down the road to learn more about how I can own my own regular or shetland pony as my companion pet. <br/><br/>Aside from that, Horses have been with us since the dawn of time...no seriously, look it up, they call it ""the Dawn Horse"" (Eh? See that? Getting some insight on my inspirations -wink-)...but seriously, they've been around since forever, when we came into their lives they rode us from place-to-place, they helped us build many things, they've went with us into battles and wars, they died with us, they race and become celebrities and they have also become great companion pets and have helped those disabled (physically, mentally, emotionally) to know there is more to life through a Horse than just cynicism, apathy, and ignorance.<br/><br/>When I go out to sell my books at comic book conventions and online to other readers, half of my profits will go into future issues of this story (being the sequel of course!) and half of the profits will go into donations for a Horse rescue, a good cause comes out of it for the good of creativity and for Horses!<br/><br/><img alt=""Walking through a dead city"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://oi37.tinypic.com/2w2ovat.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/></p>

<p><em>Now, here comes the Not-So-Nice reason...</em><br/><br/>What could possibly crush the good parts that I love about this? <strong>Horse-Slaughter</strong>. Yes, it really exists, it's been around for a while, but seems to be more frequent these days. Some people are still doing it in several parts of the world, especially in America. They back up their arguments through varied lies about ""over-population"" (of course) but it's all about easy money for corporate industries, greedy land managers and some ranchers that would rather take more profits than doing their job at ""being responsible"". Horse meat is contaminated with the use of medications that can be lethal to humans if consumed. ""Humanely Slaughtered""? Don't make me laugh.<br/><br/>Everyone, put some time aside and read up more about this issue here: <a href=""http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/horse_slaughter/facts/facts_horse_slaughter.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/horse_slaughter/facts/facts_horse_slaughter.html</a><br/><br/><strong>I personally object to it</strong> (along with many Horse Owners/Advocates/Lovers, etc.) being that we have cows, chickens, pigs and fish (to which I also love all animals in general and don't want them harmed even for consumption, but until ""cultured meat"" is more supported and hits the scene, it's unfortunate) to survive on and should not turn over to making more companion animals (both domestic or wild, yeah they slaughter both and sell them for food) into food for the sake of easy money let alone to take away our greatest discoveries and companions ever known to exist from grand ol' nature itself.<br/><br/>Doing this story I hope would help a great deal to stop this atrocity and to help keep Horses of all kinds, domesticated or wild or both, from meeting this terrible fate, especially because of the way things are in the economy. Because if I and many others (Yes, even yourself included!) can make a difference like saving and protecting this particular animal from extinction, just think of the inspirations this could do for others to make a better world for themselves, it's an incredible notion! That seems a little too optimistic, but rational people with great ideas can accomplish anything! But even if Fake Horse doesn't save the world or anything it can still account for good creativity in the arts of visual/written story-telling and can help shape others' opinions on subjects like this. If anything else it explains where I stand on the matter and will keep up a good fight!<br/><br/><img alt=""Slaughterhouse"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://oi38.tinypic.com/2jy4v9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><img alt=""The only thing they're good for..."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://oi36.tinypic.com/2jwg43.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>After reading that you probably think this project is nothing more than just a pitiful piece of propaganda, for some maybe, but anyone who is super smart will tell you to NEVER judge a book by its cover!<br/><br/>I understand my personal love for my favorite animal and a pure undeniable hatred for their fate can only be taken so far as signing petitions, donating to Horse rescues and such, part of me felt that while I am an activist on this issue I felt that I HAVE to do more than that, and what better way than to use one, if not THE greatest, of individual expressions, the Artistic Expression! But why stop there? Writing does a great deal of expression as well! Put two-and-two together and vuala!<br/><br/>Now here's the thing, this graphic novel IS a big love letter to Horses and is most-definitely a big anti-horse-slaughter message, but it is also a character-driven narrative that debates the merits of humanity's survival over companionship, spoken from the point-of-views of both the human and the horse characters in the book, what it takes to be a hardcore survivalist and what you could turn into as well as it does talk about when becoming the ""good guy"" has consequences too when you go at great lengths to defend yourself and mostly those important to you when the world becomes violently unsafe. <br/><br/>The tolls it takes on one's emotions, Bad vs Good, or heck this book has conflicts that are more formed being Good vs Good, in the nature of survival, companionship and in nature itself. Life is not always pretty, nature is a great example and it's addressed, but it CAN be changed, because change and conflict is what life is all about, only then can you find the happiness in its shades of grey. Bizarre as it all may be, it's still heart-felt because of characters coming to know creativity is what keeps their lives going, and they can't do it without each other. Such is reality.<br/><br/>Pretty deep stuff, but that's what makes it so great and I love it!<br/><br/><img alt=""Heart for us all"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://oi33.tinypic.com/2eyc2zd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

My name is Toby Johansen, I'm an independent artist, writer and filmmaker, and today I really need your help to get my heart-felt, horse-loving passion piece off the ground and to the rest of the world, that means you! I want you and everyone who would want to hold a copy of my work in their hands that can show them there are more great stories to tell, even ones about Horses!This graphic novel I've been working on since last year, is really the most passionate and greatest labour of love I've ever had when doing comics in the past since ever. I've only got about 41 pages left to draw before I go back to draw in the final details and the rest of the backgrounds and put int some color to help with the black and white when it goes into printing, that's my estimation, could be less pages if the story is progressed well!

What is this graphic novel about? Allow me to narrate!In a post-apocalyptic 2018, a man who wears a horse mask, Dawn Horse, is bent on protecting a herd of horses from savage flesh-eaters, called Scavers, while trying to make a meaningful life in a world that has stopped. As the herd of horses strive to understand what Dawn Horse teaches them and how they must learn from their surroundings amongst themselves. To survive without pride, to live with heart than with malice.How things came to be from such a time while not perfect but very free and prosperous, turned grey and deathly silent, those who survive live on with the lives they have to survive, even if that means to turn to a dark place which you may never return from to do so, or maybe you do choose to be a guardian to protect those you care about even if there are always consequences.If that plot doesn't make you scream ""Holy crap! That sounds amazingly interesting, original, dark, emotional and awesome"" then I don't know what will!You'll find 20 unfinished pages here that I know will wet your appetite! Plus some scans of my character sketches (which are part of one of the Perks I have!). I'll definitely keep you updated!



 
What I Need & What You GetI have estimated the amount to cover the printing costs and the cover artist will be $2390.You see that I set the goal at $2570, that's because of the site fees. What I'll be getting is just a little bit over $2390, if we don't make the goal then the fees will be higher. Mainly the site's fees establish that if we succeed the goal they get 4%, if I don't reach my goal then they get 9%. All $2020 of your awesome contributions will go straight into the printing costs for the book and $370 of it will go to pay a fellow artist to make the cover of the book and it's going to look beautiful as the story itself. I'll start with printing up to 370 books, it's a good start and what I'll make back from sales will go into more prints of this story, have to keep it going. :) Plus, I'll be writing a sequel book this Winter and get started on it late 2014.If I get more than my estimated goal, I'll put that extra money into some lamination work and promotion for the book!What do you get out of all this? How do these perks sound?$1 This is enough to show you care about creative passion projects which means your name will go into the beautifully designed ""Special Thanks"" page.$5 You get to own a PDF digital copy (or which ever your preferences are for digital copies please let me know) of the book when it's finished! Also with your name in the ""Special Thanks"" page.$10 You get the SOLID BOOK when it's complete and printed by November 13, 2013, delivered to your own home! You also get your name in the ""Special Thanks""! (Does NOT include digital copy)$15 Want me to autograph your copy? Totally!$50 You get the BOOK, both with your name and signed, with the addition of two beautiful posters of the front cover done by Emily Nguyen and the interior cover by KARNO!

Why, having your very own original Horse character drawn next to your name in the ""Special Thanks"" page curtasy of me! Just be sure to e-mail me your commission after purchasing this perk!$200 You get all of the above...AND...3 of my original character sheets I drew and used for visual reference while drawing my book!

<h3>I was supposed to go to MICE this year... </h3>

</div>
<div>
<h3>What the Money will be used for...</h3>
<p>Travel cost and lodging, along with money to print off and put together copies before the expo.  It will be about $325 for travel, and the rest for printing (so really only around $400, but Indiegogo requires a minimum of $500...)  </p>

<h3>Why this is important to me... </h3>
<p>I'm not going to lie guys, I have had a rough year, and I think this is going to help me feel like I'm standing on solid ground again.  This will only be my second comic-con where I am selling and I am so excited.  MICE is a great fetival where I know a lot of people, have a great crowd and I think I will sell my book well there, alongside the support of my friends.  This is my element, this is my lifes-blood, and the begining of my future - help me get there!!! </p>

Within the last several months, I’ve honed my craft and finally feel I’m ready to begin creating professional artwork for the comic book industry!</p>
<p>However, I’ve not drawn very many sequential art pages that would allow me the best opportunity to break into the industry. Predominantly, I’ve only drawn pin-ups and one-page illustrations.  Somehow they seem easier and faster to do on a tight schedule. So my goal is I would like to challenge and prepare myself for working on “regular” deadlines by drawing 60 pages of sequential comics in 5 months!</p>
<p>To hit this goal, I will need to draw <span class=""caps"">AND</span> ink 3 pages a week. This can only be made possible with <span class=""caps"">YOUR</span> <span class=""caps"">HELP</span>! Your donations will contribute to supplies, shipping, printing, and partial living costs, allowing me to treat this as a part-time job for the next five months.</p>
<p>In exchange for your generosity and assistance, by participating in my IndieGoGo program, you will receive mini comics, limited edition sketchbooks, the complete collection of short comics, original art, a chance to be one of the characters, and more! You will also have access to weekly updates and be the first to see the art produced for this project.</p>
<p>So, 60 pages in 5 months?</p>
<p>What will these pages consist of? Well, true believers, these pages will consist of no less than 5 short comic stories! The subject matter will range from adventure to science fiction, from science to philosophy, from stream-of-consciousness to plotted tales. I will have stories that provoke thought and stories that just entertain. It will all be slightly random, yet well executed.</p>
<p>When I complete each of the short comics, I will post them online for everyone to read. I will also print them each separately into a mini-comic format. When all of them are finished they will be collected into one volume with a full-color cover.   When all of the visual idea generation is complete, I’ll take all of my sketches and ideas and print them for the limited edition sketchbook.</p>
<p>For the top 3 most-generous donors, you will receive a hand-painted, wood cover version of the finished book and sketchbook combined! And I’m actually a decent painter, too!!</p>
<p>Along with the comics and sketchbook for incentive, there will be original, inked pages available as well as large cover prints. OR if you’ve donated enough, you’ll be written into one of the stories as a character and will receive a page of original artwork from that comic!! <span class=""caps"">FUN</span>! Please see the incentive descriptions below for more information.</p>
<p>I would absolutely love it if I had the chance to create 60 pages in 5 months instead of the 6 pages a <span class=""caps"">YEAR</span> that I’ve been doing. Help me to continue to improve my drawing skills exponentially and at the same time, provide you with some entertaining comic goodness!</p>
<p>Enjoy financially encouraging one of the few female comic book artists trying to get into the mainstream comic book industry! Receive cool swag! High five and thanks for considering my project!</p></div>","Hello everyone! My name is Leila del Duca and I’m a comic book artist currently living in Denver, CO.

<h3>What's the deal?!</h3>
<p>My name's Rebecca, and I'm a British student turned cartoonist. I've been living the US this year and in September I brought myself and a hastily made zine to the Small Press Expo. It was my first comic con and I had a wonderful time getting fired up about art with lovely people!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As my time on this side of the Atlantic draws to a close, I want to do it again! This time, instead of a quick zine, I want to make a <strong>15 page minicomic</strong> that looks nice and entertains.</p>
<p>It's going to be a selection of stories about two birds, because birds are great. (check out the picture section for a peek)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As well as paying for the creation of the mini, you'll also be helping me transport myself from North Carolina to Toronto for the Toronto Comic Arts Festival in May. I love comics and I love festivals and going would mean I could meet up with freinds and be part of the comics love.</p>
<p>Also, if you buy a mini here and you're attending, I'll hand it right to you and we can chat and hug and stuff! </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Costs and Perks</h3>
<p>So, as far as costs go here's how things break down:</p>
<p>printing and shipping of the mini: $100</p>
<p>travel to and from Toronto: $200</p>
<p>hotel whilst at TCAF: $300</p>
<p>indiegogo fees: $50</p>
<p>As Toronto is far away, the biggest expense is travel, if I get money over my goal, it'll be used to make the comics more swanky! Fancy cover paper, nicer printing, cover it in glitter? Who knows!</p>
<p>If I don't reach my goal, I'll downsize to a PDF comic and scour the web for the chapest thing with wheels headed north and hope I get there somehow!</p>
<p><strong>So what do you get out of this? </strong>Well! First off you'll get the minicomic either in PDF form or the full printed wonder, shipped to you or handed in person. Up the ladder of perks, you can get exclusive doodle prints, custom watercolours and other art from me! Sounds pretty good right?</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Why?</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>I love telling stories, and comics are what I want to do. I'm at my happiest creating things to share with people! With your support I can make a tangible thing and spend time getting inspired and it'd mean the world to me.</p>
<p>If you can't donate, tweets, reblogs, telling your freinds are all very much appreciated! Spread the word and with you support I can do this thing!</p>

<p>‘Windrush: Gratitude and Vengeance’ is a five issue mini-series written and illustrated by T’sao Wei, winner of the <a href=""http://marinestudiosadventuresincomics.wordpress.com/2012/02/08/life-boat/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Adventures in Comics 2</a> competition earlier in the year. The first 10 unlettered pages of Windrush issue 1 can be <a href=""http://daventerprojects.blogspot.co.uk/2011/10/windrush-issue-ones-10-page-preview.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">found here</a>, or in the gallery on this page.</p>
<h3><strong>What’s the story?</strong></h3>
<p>Helen Mu, aka Windrush, once the greatest protector of Lambeth, has been assassinated! Now, her daughter, Lauren, is forced to take up the “Windrush” mantle to prevent the South London boroughs of Lambeth and Southwark from going to war!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What’s it about?</h3>
<p>‘Windrush’ is a superhero comic that doesn’t follow the generic superhero model. It’s a very special project for me, as this is my first ongoing series and the first time that I ever truly enjoyed the unrelenting isolation of working on a comic book project. That enjoyment shows, as ‘Windrush’ embodies everything I love about fiction. It’s my love letter to the Chinese “Wuxia” genre, but disguised as a superhero comic.</p>
<p>Wuxia is often translated as “Chivalrous Knight”, but I prefer the translation “Martial Hero”. The characters of the Martial Hero genre tend to embody two distinct features: those who operate within normal society, and those who work outside of society. Outsiders are often said to exist in the “Jianghu” world, where the laws of normal society are generally of no concern to them, much like the chivalrous knights of the European tradition, who lived by their own set of moral codes. Windrush is a modern-day Wuxia heroine, fighting crime in the contemporary “Jianghu” within South London.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What will I use the funding for?</h3>
<p>For the past two months, I’ve printed and bound each copy of ‘Windrush’ by hand, but this leaves me with very little time to do much else (like actually drawing the thing!).  The money will go purely towards the printing costs and marketing of this five issue mini-series.</p>

It is well known that ham-fisted “do-gooders” like psychiatrist Dr. Fredric Wertham in his book Seduction of the Innocent condemned comics as a corrupting influence on children. Then, the Senate investigated them as a cause of juvenile delinquency. This resulted in publishers, to save their skins, adopting a self censoring contrivance called the Comics Code Authority. </p><p>All this frenzy before and after the Code drew a lot of attention to the fact that comics were a powerful form of communication passionately devoured by the public!</p><p>This spotlight on comic books alerted corporations and their advertising agencies, civic groups, religious organizations, and even the U.S. government about how comics were attractive, easily understood, engaging, and could be cheaply produced to crow about products, propagate ideologies, or push initiatives. Comics then and now can be passed out in factories, shops, schools, houses of worship, at state fairs, in streets, or sent inexpensively through the mail.</p><p>Of the estimated 25,000 different promotional/giveaway comics of the ’50s and early ’60s, a little more than a handful were devoted to the subject of voting. Sadly, these comics are the most relevant of all the mid-century titles in today’s world. The comics reprinted in <strong><i>Voting Is Your Superpower</i></strong> that were done first in the Cold War period and then in the Civil Rights era contain essential messages for today’s public.</p><p> </p><h3>Introduction by Julie (Catwoman) Newmar</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1593016027/lpyw8du5h97brmf6uu4m.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Ironically Voting is Your Super Power is introduced by Julie Newmar, infamously known as a super-villain!

Contemporary citizens who didn’t vote in the last election or didn’t study carefully and consider the candidates, can read it and weep: “You elected the man who fills government positions with his friends and relatives. If you elect a dishonest politician, you will get a graft-ridden government.” The concluding admonitions ring truer than ever: ”Pick a candidate who has a clean record, who is responsible to no one but the voters… Remember: voting is free—but careless voting or not voting at all COSTS YOU PLENTY!” </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1592248000/dlup2qf0phfvuf6zgxak.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The <strong>NAACP</strong>’s own published comic, <strong><i>The Street Where You Live And What You Can Do To Improve It</i></strong> was drawn in 1960 by <strong>Tom Feelings</strong>.

(I’ll wait). *COMICS FOR THE WIN!*Now another vote…Raise your hand if you think we need to valiantly fight for Truth, Justice, and the American Way. Raise it high if you feel we need to end any and all voter suppression and you advocate for equality and civil rights for all no matter their races, ethnic background, sexual orientation or gender identity, or age. Good! Good! All good! And now reach to the sky if you realize that these victories can be obtained because VOTING IS YOUR SUPER POWER!In this 104 page book are rare, cool, vintage, comics collection, you will find a timeless and compelling message of inspiration, motivation, and duty to exercise your right to cast your vote for progressive action so badly needed today. And when you finish and put down this book you will not only have been entertained and enlightened, but you will have realized voting IS your superpower, more formidable than a bat-a-rang, x-ray vision, spider-sense, and a magic-lasso assembled together!Brief History of Comics and Politics!The mid-1950s were a fascinating period in comic book history. It is well known that ham-fisted “do-gooders” like psychiatrist Dr. Fredric Wertham in his book Seduction of the Innocent condemned comics as a corrupting influence on children. Then, the Senate investigated them as a cause of juvenile delinquency. This resulted in publishers, to save their skins, adopting a self censoring contrivance called the Comics Code Authority. All this frenzy before and after the Code drew a lot of attention to the fact that comics were a powerful form of communication passionately devoured by the public!This spotlight on comic books alerted corporations and their advertising agencies, civic groups, religious organizations, and even the U.S. government about how comics were attractive, easily understood, engaging, and could be cheaply produced to crow about products, propagate ideologies, or push initiatives. Comics then and now can be passed out in factories, shops, schools, houses of worship, at state fairs, in streets, or sent inexpensively through the mail.Of the estimated 25,000 different promotional/giveaway comics of the ’50s and early ’60s, a little more than a handful were devoted to the subject of voting. Sadly, these comics are the most relevant of all the mid-century titles in today’s world. The comics reprinted in Voting Is Your Superpower that were done first in the Cold War period and then in the Civil Rights era contain essential messages for today’s public. Introduction by Julie (Catwoman) NewmarIronically Voting is Your Super Power is introduced by Julie Newmar, infamously known as a super-villain! Here the Tony-winning star of stage and screen known for her role as Catwoman now heroically roars to get out the vote!  Our new voting super hero General Election!
And this exciting  buzz-worthy book is hosted by a new super hero for our times... General Election! In her first appearance General Election is ablaze with voting power on our special cover by Eisner nominee Sanford Greene the fan-favorite artist of Bitter Root. The Man with the Plan, Craig YoeEdited, designed, and with a forward by Craig Yoe, Multiple Eisner Award winner. The RARE, entertaining, and motivating comic books that are collected in their entirety in this fascinating must-have book!Some of the top creative people and publishers were behind the comics about the importance of registering and voting. Your Vote Is Vital was drawn by the major talents Walter Kremer and Al Alvison for Harvey Comics (Richie Rich, Casper). In Your Vote Is Vital, Spokestoon Uncle Sam warns (via his math skills) how a voting minority can sway an election over a non-voting majority. The next two comics in Voting Is Your Super Power were published in 1952 by the now-defunct National Research Bureau as part of their Good Government Series. The Man Who Stole Your Vote would be quite amusing—if it wasn’t so true! Who is the real villain in this story, the strange hooded character or Fred, the stay-at-home voter? Read the comic to find out!The other National Research Bureau comic, If Your Kids Could Vote, features a Greta Thunberg and a David Hogg of the ’50s chiding adults for their lax attitude towards their rights to cast their ballots. Spoiler alert: The parental units get helped by the kids. “A little child shall lead them.” An American Family Gets Out The Vote was produced by the American Heritage Foundation (not to be confused with today’s Heritage Foundation, one of the most influential conservative public policy organizations in the United States) and has some celeb cameos including Honest Abe Lincoln; Patrick Henry; Suffragette superhero and feminist, Susan B. Anthony; and even Lady of Liberty herself, the statue “whose beacon welcomes those who seek the freedom that America affords.” The free giveaway comic The Price You Pay For Graft is priceless. Out of all the promotional comics about voting, it is the most hard-hitting about corrupt politicians. The art is retro, but the message is grievously relevant. The comic speaks loudly from the past to voters of today about lobbyists. Contemporary citizens who didn’t vote in the last election or didn’t study carefully and consider the candidates, can read it and weep: “You elected the man who fills government positions with his friends and relatives. If you elect a dishonest politician, you will get a graft-ridden government.” The concluding admonitions ring truer than ever: ”Pick a candidate who has a clean record, who is responsible to no one but the voters… Remember: voting is free—but careless voting or not voting at all COSTS YOU PLENTY!” The NAACP’s own published comic, The Street Where You Live And What You Can Do To Improve It was drawn in 1960 by Tom Feelings. Feelings went on to win the Newberry Award and a Caldecott Honor, and captured not one, not two, but three Coretta Scott King Awards. Besides its laudable cause of getting Blacks to the polls, this comic book brings great dignity to the Black citizens young and old who inhabited this street—and streets like it across the land.Leading comics historians say that the NAACP’s Your Future Rests… In Your Hands! (1964) was a Marvel Comic’s production. Probably co-edited by Stan Lee with the NAACP, it was drawn by Larry Leiber, Lee’s younger brother. Leiber even autographed the copy we reproduce, taken from the collection of Marvel historian, Nick Caputo. Your Future was lettered by Marvel’s calligrapher of this period, Sam Rosen. According to Caputo, Leiber’s pencil work may have been inked by Sol Brodsky with a few touches by Marie Severin.A Marvel writer of Sgt. Fury, Allan Kurzok, working with the League of Women Voters in New York City, wrote and drew Voteman, the first superhero of voting. The League touted Voteman: “The New York City League of Women Voters has devised a comic book technique to inform residents of 63 slum neighborhoods of a voter registration drive. The actions of Voteman, the Black superhero of the simply-stated comic, are designed to indicate changes that the residents’ votes could help bring about within their communities.”What You Can Get to Show Your Voter Support!The 104 page book collecting rare historical COMPLETE comic bookspromoting voter awareness! 2.25"" x 2.25"" metal backed pin button.  4"" x 4"" magnet.  4"" x 6"" mailing postcards.  Women's cut t-shirt with ""General Election"" graphic. ""General Election"" graphic available in men's cut.  ""Voting is Your Superpower!"" graphic on men's cut t-shirt.Also available in women's cut. The TeamCraig YoeVice magazine has called Yoe the ""Indiana Jones of comics historians.""

Metazoa is a comic cloaked in an allegory in the tradition of George Orwell's <i>Animal Farm;</i> an
ideological critique of class inequity with anthropomorphic characters. In this modern society, where the Animalia are oppressed by corruption,
threatened by environmental collapse, and seeped in cultural apathy, there is
an escape hatch… cyberspace. Many Animalia retreat into that virtual realm and
ignore the real world as it slides further into decline. <br/></p>

<p>Among the many characters in Metazoa the central one is Ram, a grizzly bear and

his element. Reflexes cranked but pulse steady. Absolute concentration.
Absolute control. But his edge is about to slip when he meets a beautiful
cottontail rabbit and accepts a contract for a mysterious organization known as
the 5C, a group of environmental activists fighting to preserve the natural
world. They are revolutionary agents of change – modern day Robin Hoods who
have been flagged as enemies of the state. The
time of peace has ended and Ram, an ex-soldier with no cause left to fight
for, has found himself in the middle of a new war.

</div></div>","A 99-page independent cyberpunk comic and the debut mini-series by co-creators, Peter Marshall Smith (writer, letters) and Sandy Brion Spreitz (artist, colors). 
We need your help to reach our goal in this print drive for METAZOA, a new sci-fi adventure
set on a parallel world where the vertebrate Animalia have evolved and developed an
advanced civilization that is rich in honor, but unable to live in peace. 




Metazoa is a comic cloaked in an allegory in the tradition of George Orwell's Animal Farm; an
ideological critique of class inequity with anthropomorphic characters. In this modern society, where the Animalia are oppressed by corruption,
threatened by environmental collapse, and seeped in cultural apathy, there is
an escape hatch… cyberspace. Many Animalia retreat into that virtual realm and
ignore the real world as it slides further into decline. 


Among the many characters in Metazoa the central one is Ram, a grizzly bear and
dangerous adept. But Ram is no hero. He's a street-wise survivor with a violent
temper navigating a violent world as a hacker for hire.


Ram strolls the streets of the new ghetto camouflaged like any true hustler in
his element. Reflexes cranked but pulse steady. Absolute concentration.
Absolute control. But his edge is about to slip when he meets a beautiful
cottontail rabbit and accepts a contract for a mysterious organization known as
the 5C, a group of environmental activists fighting to preserve the natural
world. They are revolutionary agents of change – modern day Robin Hoods who
have been flagged as enemies of the state. The
time of peace has ended and Ram, an ex-soldier with no cause left to fight
for, has found himself in the middle of a new war. 




 






THE CO-CREATORS

For illustrator, Sandy Brion Spreitz, Metazoa started when his childhood friend, Peter Marshall Smith, reached out to him. Peter remembered a comic character that Sandy had created back in 1984 named Ram. Here are a few old sketches: 

Peter sent Sandy the script for Metazoa Book One and when Sandy read it he said:  ""A little voice inside of me said, 'Yes! Yes!' We plugged away through character development and storyboards... Once we finalized our look and refined our process, I was amazed and astounded at the results. And if I am not mistaken, so was Peter. Most of my career has been greeting cards and editorial illustration. It never occurred to me to do comics professionally. Now, I work 7 days a week on Metazoa. I wake up and get right to work. At night, I dream of Metazoa. This project has been an act of love. And it has renewed my interest in all things... This book is dedicated to that little voice in all of us! Long live Metazoa!""


METAZOA #1 AND #2 ARE NOW AVAILABLE HERE ON COMIXOLOGY SUBMIT, but if you contribute now you will receive an additional digital issue before it is released to the public! All 3 issues constitute volume one of an the mini-series entitled METAZOA: WILDLIFE. Although we're excited to share Ram's adventures with you digitally, we need your help to print paperback and hardcover editions of the 1st volume. Here are mockups of the planned printed editions of METAZOA Vol.1

<h3>Introduction </h3>
<p>Hi there! My name is Hady A. Hamid. I've been reading comic books since I was 12, and ever since then, I've been fascinated by the world of superheroes, fantasy and sci-fi. Those elements immediately struck me as something I can hang on to, since as a kid, I needed to constantly escape to a world where good truly triumphs over evil.</p>
<p>I've been creating my own comic book characters since 12, but started refining them when I hit 20. And the dream just kept getting bigger and bigger, and more real as I began to realize that I could actually write many stories about my characters, and write them well. At present, Red Grade Comics has over 200 characters that will span over 300+ issues.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Professionally, I'm a TV writer with 7 years of experience, and I've recently graduated from Chapman University with a Bachelor in Creative Producing. It was there that I learned how to combine my comic book knowledge and writing skills with real-world media business strategies and know-how. </span></p>
<p>""Be Part of a New Era, Be Part of Red Grade Comics"" is my campaign to raise funds required to set up Red Grade Comics and its official site, redgradecomics.com, which will act as the main distribution platform for our digital comics.</p>
<p>As of now, we already have an official Facebook page (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/redgradecomics"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/redgradecomics</a>) that contains many of our selected promotional images. We have an official blog called The Red Grade (<a href=""http://redgrade.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://redgrade.wordpress.com/</a>) that features important updates regarding the progress of Red Grade-related matters, as well as links to new images. We have also recently completed the inaugural issue of Eras #0, and are looking towards finishing Eras #1-#20 to complete our first story arc, ""Rebirth"".</p>
<p>Who is ""we"" that I've been talking about? Well, it's just me and my best friend/artist, Muhammad Ali. We realize that we can no longer do this part-time. We need assemble a team that can commit full-time in order for us to achieve our 1 June 2016 launch date.</p>
<p>By contributing to our campaign, you'll help us get a step further to achieving our goal, and you will also be part of a new era of comic books!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What's in It for You?</h3>
<p>We have actually worked out the math, and we need a total of $400,000 to run our operation for the first two years. My artist and I have agreed to contribute $60,000, and so we are seeking the remaining $340,000 through investors, grants and crowd-funding.</p>
<p>But for now, we are testing the waters with this campaign to see whether we can raise funds, while at the same time, market our brand. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The $40,000 that we seek will go towards setting up the team, producing subsequent issues, developing the website and producing marketing materials.</span></p>
<p>Now, you may ask yourself, ""What's in it for you?""</p>
<p>Since our comic books will mostly be distributed digitally, the top 500 contributors will be able to receive single-issue physical copies of Eras #0-#2! The top 50 contributors will be able to receive hardcover physical copies of Eras #0-#20, the entire story arc of ""Rebirth""! And, the top 5 contributors will be able to have their names used as characters (hero or villain)!</p>
<p>Exciting, isn't it?</p>
<p>But what if we don't actually reach our targeted amount? Well, we'll still use whatever money we get to set up our team. Because this dream...it's never going to die. It's been with me since I was 12, and that was back in 1996. Now, you kinda have an idea why we plan to launch in 2016 - to mark the 20 years of developing our dream!</p>

<h3>Our Conviction</h3>
<p>I was raised with a lot of American pop culture, one of which was comic books. To this day, comic books are still considered one of the best exports of America, and <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I believe it's because of the values embedded within them.</span></p>
<p>Call me old-fashioned, but I believe in living life with certain values.</p>
<p>At Red Grade Comics, our mission statement is as such: To share great and inspiring stories with the rest of the world. Because I believe a story shouldn't just be about exciting twists and turns or exploitation. I believe a story should come with a potent, responsible message for society. It can be dark, fantastical and even whimsical, but what's the point of telling a story if people can't learn from it?</p>
<p>The aforementioned 300+ issues that we have planned...they will be spread across five major Books - Faith, Justice, Hope, Freedom and Peace. Through these five convictions, we aim to share stories that not only inspire on an aesthetic level, but also on a societal level.</p>

<h3>Let's Try This Again</h3>
<div>This will be the second time through this campaign. Last time we raised $1500, but we're still $2000 short of our goal. We've got enough to get through colors on issue #4, but we still need extra funds in order to finish issue #5 and complete the letters for issues #2-5. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We're still offering the same perks as last time, including getting drawn into the book as a demon, human or zombie. The only change is that now instead of our major perk being getting drawn into the book as the Devil, we are offering to be drawn into the book as GOD. </div>
<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My Name is Russell Nohelty.  I've got one book, Ichabod Jones:  Monster Hunter, that will be published through Viper Comics later this year.  It's a great book but I want to keep moving forward with new comics as well. My next four issue mini-series will be KATRINA HATES DEAD SHIT. (<a href=""http://www.katrinacomic.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""text-decoration: underline;""></a><a href=""http://www.katrinacomic.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.katrinacomic.com/</a>)</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>KATRINA HATES DEAD SHIT follows a badass chick who survives the Rapture and now lives in a small town full of demons, Hellspawn and a smattering of dreadful survivors. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<div>
<p><br/>Things are about as terrible as one would imagine after the Rapture but given the circumstances Katrina is taking not being ""blue-lighted"" pretty well. Even though she's got a terrible job, horrible co-workers, a leeching ex-roommate and a miserable attitude to boot things could always get worse...somehow.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Things become so dreadful for Katrina that she decides to fight back in a most extreme manner, by traveling to hell and forcing the Devil to end the Apocalypse once and for all.  </p>
<p><br/>KATRINA HATES DEAD SHIT is a 4 issue mini-series that gives a tongue in cheek look at how surviving the Apocalypse will suck donkey balls but it's not the end of the world. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Katrina is drawn by the uber talented Juan Frigeri (<a href=""http://spadjm.deviantart.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://spadjm.deviantart.com/</a>) colored by the amazing Thomas Bacon (<a href=""http://thomasbacon.webs.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://thomasbacon.webs.com/</a>) and lettered by the fantastic Bernie Lee (<a href=""http://www.comicspace.com/blee/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.comicspace.com/blee/</a>).  </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm already in production on the first issue of Katrina, but I frankly need money to keep this project going through the first issue.  I'm currently in production on three books with a fourth to follow.  Because I use only top quality talent and never scrimp on hiring a fantastic artist it's become too costly to keep more than one book in production at any given time.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>You can see the fruits of hiring top tier talent by reading the first eleven pages of issue #1 at<a href=""http://www.katrinacomic.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.katrinacomic.com/</a>.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>That's where you come in.  Without your help more issues of Katrina Hates Dead Shit might never happen and that would be a shame because it's a great story for any fans of Apocalyptic books, horror books, comedy books or any fan of comics young or old (though not too young).  I like to say that it's Left Behind told as a comedy.   </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Take a look at the perks on the side and even if you can help with $1 it would be great.  If you can help more than you'll see some really cool perks including copies of the book all the way up to being drawn as the DEVIL in our final issue!  That's right Katrina travels into Hell to confront the Devil and that could be you!   </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I know this is a pretty ambitious goal, but I'm a pretty ambitious guy and I know with your help we'll get there!  </p>

<p><strong>The next production of Fotocomix: The Cinematic Graphic Novel<br/></strong></p>
<p>The story follows two women (Lily and Colette Dangerous) as they make their way through a post apocalyptic, steampunk society. Here's a brief synopsis:</p>
<p><strong><em>Danger Girls: A New World<br/><br/>A small chapter in the tale of Lily and Colette Dangerous; a pair of post apocalyptic steampunk danger girls.<br/><br/>The setting is sun blasted desert. Lily and Colette Dangerous are going to a meeting in their beat up old suburban.<br/><br/>They have a skull and they turn it in to claim a reward from the Greasy Man. They collect the reward and then Kill the Greasy Man. Seems he has a reward out for him too. <br/><br/>But things are not as they seem. The Greasy Man can’t be killed. In fact he is an agent of an old, long slumbering evil. The Danger Girls don’t know it but this has been an audition. Their audition. The Greasy Man is sending them on an errand. <br/><br/>Refusal to go or failure to complete the Greasy Man’s errand could rend the souls of the Danger Girls and everyone they care about.<br/><br/>Lily and Colette have no story from before. They are a team or a couple or maybe both. They take what they can find and use what they need. They may be lovers. Maybe out of convenience, maybe out of romance. They may take a man individually, together or they may lure him in to letting his guard down with sex and then kill him and take his possessions. Either way they are committed to each other first and foremost. They are outlaws and bounty hunter as prone to generosity as they are prone to atrocity, it all depends on their need and their mood.<br/><br/>Danger Girls: A New World is an action adventure graphic novel. Instead of drawn art, Danger Girls: A New World will use cinematic quality photographs presented in the classic comic style.<br/><br/>We are shooting the first in the saga of Danger Girls: A New World near Kingman, AZ the weekend of May 17,18 and 19th. Our campaign through indigogo.com is working to raise $1000. This figure completely covers fuel, food  lodging wardrobe and other unforeseen expenses.<br/><br/>We have a number of perks available for donors at all levels of support. You can donate anonymously or we will gladly shout our thanks from the proverbial rooftops.</em></strong></p>
<p>My name is Dan Gruen, my friends call me 'Dano'. I'm a creative individual from Flagstaff, Arizona. I've been a writer and a photographer for as long as I can remember. I just never found a way to truly blend the two mediums for myself.</p>
<p>A year ago that changed. A group of photographers I shoot with set up a challenge: create a 10 image portfolio of new work. Any subject was ok however, all the images had to be linked together. I had been watching Dr Who on netflix and one morning woke up from a dream that was all Dr Who, Frank Miller and Sucker Punch. A concept was right there in my mind: Seela. I produced Seela, shot it and entered it into the contest........it bombed. If they were giving medals, Seela would have taken Talc for sure.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The idea hasn't left me. Tell stories using the graphic novel format with live actors and cinematic quality photos.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Danger Girls: A New World</strong> is the next level and I can't do it alone.</p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p>I'm currently working with two amazing models a crew of believers and one Welsh cinematographer who is a long way away.</p>
<p><br/>Developing a new genre of art is no small endeavor, that's why I need help. To say that this is going to be a groundbreaking leap into new expressive forms of art is....disingenuous. Danger Girls is a small step. Danger Girls is a strong, relatable short story that puts stereotypes, archetypes and paradigms all in question. It's also a potential vehicle to use for giving this medium a life of it's own.</p>

<h3>Here's what I need from you:</h3>
<p><br/>I'm looking to raise $1000.00. I'm going to use your money to take care of my cast and crew and print 1st edition copies of <strong>""Danger Girls: A New World.""</strong> for everyone who can contribute more than $50 bucks (more on that later).</p>
<p>We'll be shooting in the Arizona desert near Kingman and Lake Havasu in mid may. It's going to be HOT. If I self fund this I can pull it off. We will be camping, eating mac and cheese but we can pull it off. With your help, I can let these people sleep in air-conditioned motoel rooms (3 rooms x 2 nights), feed them right (3 meals a day x 2 models and 4 crew) and fuel the beastly suburban (550 miles x 10mpg) and believe me they will deserve it!</p>
<p>If we don't meet our goal of a full $1000, we are going anyway. The first priority with your funds will be motel rooms. If we need to we will bunk up so that we can get out of the heat overnight. Beyond that I'm covering expenses out of my pocket to keep them as comfortable as I can. These folks are hearty adventurers so, they will be up to the challenge.</p>
<br/><strong>Art Is Vital!</strong>
</div>
<div>
<strong><br/></strong>Fiction also allows us to explore topics that might be taboo under other circumstances. In the synopsis above you can get the idea that Lily and Colette are not you average female sci fi characters. There is an ambiguous nature to their relationshp, they are strong, fierce characters full of integrity. They challenge sterotypes of women and make no apologies, they are who they are.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>I need you to get on board with me!</h3>
I need your input as I finish prep for this. I'm outfitting the shoot as I start this campaign. I'll be looking for your thoughts on wardrobe, props and fine points of the story line. I'm going to need some logo design work too.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I guess that means that this isn't just about money. If you can help with a contribution, that's great. If you can't you can still be involved. It's all going to be on my tumblr:</div>

<p>This Indiegogo  project is to help raise funds to get this series printed. We would love to sell it in stores as well as it’s digital counterparts.<br/><br/></p>
<p>I wanted to make something that was visually appealing fantasy adventure, tied with elements of comedy and drama. I wanted to make a comic that would grab the reader and take them on a escapade of imagination and creative storytelling. I wanted to make the comic books that I wanted to see.<br/><br/>I had to find the style of the comic from my brain and put it into book form. A style that speaks its own tune.</p>

<p><i><strong>Detective Loki #1 Variant </strong></i></p>
<h2 align=""center""> </h2>
<h2 align=""center""><strong>“Main Plot”</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>The Main Plot will focus on Detective <strong>William Loki </strong>of the Philadelphia PD.</p>
<p><strong>Loki </strong>will start off the story with the murder investigation witch will lead him deep into the criminal underworld. Because of this Loki will cross paths with <strong>The Cover Society</strong> and its charter cast.<br/>Not long after Loki will begin to unravel the plot against the city's Vigilantes by<strong> Damon Ize.<br/>Ize </strong>himself will be the main antagonist however he will be mostly in the shadows at first.<br/>As his plans will not come to light just yet. </p>
<p>At its <u>core </u>this is a<strong> Noir Detective </strong>story. However, the main plot will also dive into the positives and negatives of vigilantism in a real-world setting, how it affects the people being protected by the masks and the people wearing them. The plot will explore the psychology of its main character cast and showcase the trauma these people might be going through as they put their lives on the line each day.<br/>All of this will be complicated by the ever-increasing presence of cybernetics in our daily lives.<br/>Side plots will include the development of <strong>The Covert Society </strong>with its current members as well<br/>the hacker group <strong>PHOBIA</strong>. </p>
<p>Do not let the<strong> Noir Detective </strong>story fool you…. We know how to have FUN!<br/>The series will also explore the implementation of true character driven humor into the world and vibe of <strong>Noir. </strong>Allowing a world to be fantastic yet oddly real and relatable at the same time.</p>

<h3><i><strong>- Ize Tower standing at 1900 feet tall.</strong></i></h3>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><i>Back Story:</i></h3>
<p>Vigilantes have been in the city of Philadelphia for <strong>24</strong> years, almost a quarter of a century and have become as symbolic with the city and culture as much as the city’s football team <strong>The Birds</strong>. </p>
<p>In <strong>2020</strong> when the city was struggling to battle crime, drug and gang wars due to the very limited funds and resources available to the Police, the very first Vigilante known as <strong>Phoenix</strong> rose from the streets of Philadelphia to mainstream attraction as his heroics including crime fighting, drug busts, neighborhood patrolling and citizen arrests were documented and uploaded to his <strong>VidWorld</strong> channel in the hopes of scaring the rest of the criminal organizations in the city. This however led to the criminals aligning themselves with one another to stop <b>him</b> from taking any more money and control away from them.</p>
<p>What <strong>Phoenix </strong>didn't expect was that he would also inspire others to take up vigilante alter egos and fight crime alongside him in the streets. Not too long after <strong>Phoenix </strong>became an internet sensation more and more vigilantes started popping up around the city.<br/>This is commonly referred to as the “<strong>Phoenix Phenomenon”</strong> by <i>psychologists</i> around the world as they believe the people of Philadelphia in such desperate times needed a <strong>Hero</strong> that was one of them, truly one of them, one that had felt their pain and suffering, someone that they could look up to in their most desperate time of need and be inspired to do the same.</p>
<p><strong>Phoenix</strong> was very open to the public and media and still remains the so called “Extended Hand” of the masked world to the open one. He revealed many things including his extreme love for football, to his daily hobbies as well as informing the public that he had a <strong>PhD</strong> in Computer Science. </p>
<p><strong>Phoenix</strong> was able to fund this life type of lifestyle thanks to his smart financial investments at an early age. Unknown to the public <strong>he</strong> became a Multi-Millionaire worth over 700 million dollars. Owning a multitude of businesses around the world including his main asset which was a Computer software company.</p>
<p>By the end of <strong>2023</strong> there were two dozen Masked heroes in the city and together they formed a group known as “<strong>The Covert Society</strong>” with <strong>Phoenix </strong>voted as the Leader.<br/>After this he decided to fully fund this operation and purchased a huge underground shipping warehouse right outside of Downtown Philadelphia that he converted into the group Headquarters and training facilitate. Here there was shelter for those would join their cause and abandoned their past lives. <strong>Phoenix </strong>went as far as paying people salaries for their work.<br/><strong>TCS </strong>as they were referred to would not only be recognized by the city and its officials but would also work shoulder to shoulder with the Philadelphia PD to help secure the safety and well being of its citizens. <strong>TCS</strong> would also do secret missions<strong>. </strong>These covert missions varied from small crime busts to large scale corruption take-downs all around the city’s metro area.</p>
<p>In <strong>2036 Ize Tech</strong> opened its wallet to the city of Philadelphia as they provided millions of dollars in funding to the city’s police force. Thanks to this partnership <strong>Ize Tech</strong> was also able to arm the city’s finest with new and improved vehicles, equipment as well as firearms all which implemented the cyber technologies developed by the company themselves.<br/>Year by year the city's allegiance grew thinner towards the masked hero’s that kept it safe for nearly two decades and thicker towards <strong>Doman Ize’s</strong> wallet.</p>
<p>In the year <strong>2041 Phoenix tragically </strong>died from a fatal gunshot to the neck that he sustained during a pursuit of a Grand Theft Auto. His identity was concealed from the public due to the amount of respect the city and all its citizens had for him.<br/>He was built a Memorial in Downtown Philadelphia where he was buried.<br/>Not too long after the help of the <strong>TCS</strong> was deemed unnecessary by the city as they believed after <strong>Phoenixes </strong>death there would be no true leadership within the group.<br/>The long lasting partnership between the city and the hero’s ended. Many masked hero’s hung up their alter egos in the closet to never be seen again. But not all left the fight, a few still remained. But the number of masked people in the city has fallen every year, and now less than ten Vigilantes remain in Philadelphia.</p>

Detective Loki #1 Variant 
 
“Main Plot”
 
The Main Plot will focus on Detective William Loki of the Philadelphia PD.
Loki will start off the story with the murder investigation witch will lead him deep into the criminal underworld. Because of this Loki will cross paths with The Cover Society and its charter cast.Not long after Loki will begin to unravel the plot against the city's Vigilantes by Damon Ize.Ize himself will be the main antagonist however he will be mostly in the shadows at first.As his plans will not come to light just yet. 
At its core this is a Noir Detective story. However, the main plot will also dive into the positives and negatives of vigilantism in a real-world setting, how it affects the people being protected by the masks and the people wearing them. The plot will explore the psychology of its main character cast and showcase the trauma these people might be going through as they put their lives on the line each day.All of this will be complicated by the ever-increasing presence of cybernetics in our daily lives.Side plots will include the development of The Covert Society with its current members as wellthe hacker group PHOBIA. 
Do not let the Noir Detective story fool you…. We know how to have FUN!The series will also explore the implementation of true character driven humor into the world and vibe of Noir. Allowing a world to be fantastic yet oddly real and relatable at the same time.
 
 
“Setting”
 
“Detective Loki” is set in a cyberpunk aesthetic Philadelphia of the year 2044.Where the world is slowly starting to embrace cybernetics not only into the streets and city infrastructure but into the lives of people via cybernetic augmentation.The City of Philadelphia became known as “Cyber City” due to the leading development and manufacturing company in cybernetics known as “Ize Tech”.The private company that was started and still operates out of the city.

- Ize Tower standing at 1900 feet tall.
 
 
Back Story:
Vigilantes have been in the city of Philadelphia for 24 years, almost a quarter of a century and have become as symbolic with the city and culture as much as the city’s football team The Birds. 
In 2020 when the city was struggling to battle crime, drug and gang wars due to the very limited funds and resources available to the Police, the very first Vigilante known as Phoenix rose from the streets of Philadelphia to mainstream attraction as his heroics including crime fighting, drug busts, neighborhood patrolling and citizen arrests were documented and uploaded to his VidWorld channel in the hopes of scaring the rest of the criminal organizations in the city. This however led to the criminals aligning themselves with one another to stop him from taking any more money and control away from them.
What Phoenix didn't expect was that he would also inspire others to take up vigilante alter egos and fight crime alongside him in the streets. Not too long after Phoenix became an internet sensation more and more vigilantes started popping up around the city.This is commonly referred to as the “Phoenix Phenomenon” by psychologists around the world as they believe the people of Philadelphia in such desperate times needed a Hero that was one of them, truly one of them, one that had felt their pain and suffering, someone that they could look up to in their most desperate time of need and be inspired to do the same.
Phoenix was very open to the public and media and still remains the so called “Extended Hand” of the masked world to the open one. He revealed many things including his extreme love for football, to his daily hobbies as well as informing the public that he had a PhD in Computer Science. 
Phoenix was able to fund this life type of lifestyle thanks to his smart financial investments at an early age. Unknown to the public he became a Multi-Millionaire worth over 700 million dollars. Owning a multitude of businesses around the world including his main asset which was a Computer software company.
By the end of 2023 there were two dozen Masked heroes in the city and together they formed a group known as “The Covert Society” with Phoenix voted as the Leader.After this he decided to fully fund this operation and purchased a huge underground shipping warehouse right outside of Downtown Philadelphia that he converted into the group Headquarters and training facilitate. Here there was shelter for those would join their cause and abandoned their past lives. Phoenix went as far as paying people salaries for their work.TCS as they were referred to would not only be recognized by the city and its officials but would also work shoulder to shoulder with the Philadelphia PD to help secure the safety and well being of its citizens. TCS would also do secret missions. These covert missions varied from small crime busts to large scale corruption take-downs all around the city’s metro area.
In 2036 Ize Tech opened its wallet to the city of Philadelphia as they provided millions of dollars in funding to the city’s police force. Thanks to this partnership Ize Tech was also able to arm the city’s finest with new and improved vehicles, equipment as well as firearms all which implemented the cyber technologies developed by the company themselves.Year by year the city's allegiance grew thinner towards the masked hero’s that kept it safe for nearly two decades and thicker towards Doman Ize’s wallet.
In the year 2041 Phoenix tragically died from a fatal gunshot to the neck that he sustained during a pursuit of a Grand Theft Auto. His identity was concealed from the public due to the amount of respect the city and all its citizens had for him.He was built a Memorial in Downtown Philadelphia where he was buried.Not too long after the help of the TCS was deemed unnecessary by the city as they believed after Phoenixes death there would be no true leadership within the group.The long lasting partnership between the city and the hero’s ended. Many masked hero’s hung up their alter egos in the closet to never be seen again. But not all left the fight, a few still remained. But the number of masked people in the city has fallen every year, and now less than ten Vigilantes remain in Philadelphia.

We want to bring North America some of the best comics produced Down Under. We want to spend over 48 hours in planes and airports, and we need your help!</p>
<p>Happily we’ve already secured a grant from the Australia Council to support this trip, but it comes nowhere close to covering the total cost of flights, accommodation, shipping our books over and so on. No one makes much money from comics in Australia, so we are appealing to you – readers, comics lovers, patrons of the arts, fans and friends who might like to meet us: help us get to North America. (And get some great rewards as thanks for your generosity.)</p>
<h2><strong>WHO ARE WE?</strong></h2>

<h2><strong>WHAT’S IT FOR?</strong></h2>

No one makes much money from comics in Australia, so we are appealing to you – readers, comics lovers, patrons of the arts, fans and friends who might like to meet us: help us get to North America. (And get some great rewards as thanks for your generosity.)
WHO ARE WE?
On board the Caravan of Comics 2013 are six cartoonists, and one filmmaker:

Scarlette Baccini (Zombolette, Jesus Reloadeth’d)
Mirranda Burton (Hidden)
Marijka Gooding (Strange Behaviour)
Gregory Mackay (Francis Bear, Turkey Comix (France))
Daniel Hayward (Graphic Novels! Melbourne!, This Is Roller Derby)
Bruce Mutard (The Sacrifice, The Silence, A Mind of Love)
Think of us as the Magnificent Seven, except with pens and paper instead of guns.
You can learn more about us at the Caravan of Comics 2013 website.
PLEASE NOTE: Unfortunately, Patrick Alexander has had to withdraw from the 2013 Caravan. However, this does not change the donor perks; Patrick is still offering art prints and original art to donors, and will still contribute to the Caravan 2013 Comic Book. Please see his update (by clicking the 'Updates' tab above) for more information.
WHAT’S IT FOR?
Naturally the six of us have various reasons for joining the Caravan, but broadly speaking, this will be a great opportunity to promote Australian comics overseas and network with cartooning peers and comics publishers – as well as a chance to meet readers and fans from the other side of the planet. We’re looking forward to meeting some of the world’s finest cartoonists, and sharing our own unique creations with the international comics community.
We are also bringing a feature length documentary – Graphic Novels! Melbourne! – which investigates the strange water we have in Melbourne, such that it should produce so many cracking good cartoonists. The film focuses on four in specific: Pat Grant, Mandy Ord, Nicki Greenberg, and member of this tour, Bruce Mutard. Visit our website and Facebook for screening venues and times.
WHERE ARE WE GOING?
First, there'll be a screening of Graphic Novels! Melbourne!, with a special presentation by Dan and Bruce, on May 8 at the Carlton Cinema, Toronto.
Then we attend the Toronto Comics Arts Festival (TCAF), May 11-12, where we are featured guests. We will be selling and signing our books and doing a range of panels and presentations. Check the expo site for details.
An in-store presentation and book signing at Librairie Drawn & Quarterly in Montreal on May 15. We will also be screening an extended trailer of Graphic Novels! Melbourne! in lieu of an actual screening (which we hope we can still do).
An in-store presentation, book signing and screening of Graphic Novels! Melbourne! at Fantagraphics Bookshop in Seattle on May 18.
Bruce will then go to the International Comic Arts Forum in Portland, OR, on May 23-25, to present his paper: Out Of The Gutter And Into The Panel: Comics closure as qualia of art imitating life. The conference is open to the public and free to register. Head to their site.
There may be smaller drawing jams, in-stores and other things we can fit in on the road as they come to hand. Like most Australian mammals, we are friendly, furry types.
AND ABOUT THE MONEY…
In gratitude for your donations we are offering some special gifts, from DVDs to limited edition prints and original art works. Check out the rewards list to the right for more details.
But what’s the money for? We’ve set an initial campaign goal of $10,000 – here’s our estimate of how that will break down:
$8000 – International transport and accommodation for the Caravaneers: flights, trains, hotels/hostels.$1400 – Printing, manufacturing and postage costs for your donor rewards!
$600 – Indiegogo’s cut: 4% plus 3% of any credit card payments.
Stretch goals:
If we exceed our initial goal, all the better! We have an Ultimate Super-Goal of $20,000, which will cover additional costs such as domestic travel, meals, and nasty surprises. If we reach this goal, we’ll come up with some additional rewards for our wonderful backers. Stay tuned to our Facebook and website for updates.
THANK YOU SO MUCH

<p><strong>Rockabilly Roadtrip</strong> #1 is a 22-page full color comic that introduces a brand-new type of heroic duo. Also, available the 155-page perfect bound trade paper back. Which chronicles the first 6 issues of the original Rockabilly Roadtrip series from 2006 to 2014. Presented in its original B/W indie format.</p>
<h3>What's This All About?</h3>
<p>Rockabilly Roadtrip is a cross-country love story of a man, his car and his homemade bride. On the roadtrip, we follow our hero, Nicky ""The Pipe"" who has just completed work on his long time project ""The Devil Driver"", his dream automobile.</p>
<p>Nicky is an average guy with one special talent, he can build ANYTHING! He often refers to his special talent as his superpower and rightfully so. After completing work on his amazing, custom car he used his talents to build himself a driving companion to compliment the look of his newest creation.</p>
<p>When his bombshell of a passenger dummy whom he lovingly refers to as Patches, mysteriously comes to life he decides there would be no better way to educate her on the ways of the world than with a road trip across the U.S. of A. Doing so would also let him break in his new ride and possibly win Patches' heart.</p>
<p>However, this ""Rockabilly RoadTrip"" is anything but typical! Chainsaw wielding psychos in Texas and a Voodoo, Swamp-Zombie infestation at a roadside stop in Louisiana are just the start of the problems our heroes run into on the road. So come along for the trip! And don't miss a single issue of the cross-country, love-story adventure that is Rockabilly RoadTrip!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Growing up, I was raised on the works of Jack Kirby, who created Captain America as a reaction to the Holocaust. World War 2 has cast a long shadow over the comic book industry as the war affected the families of people like Joe Kubert, Art Spiegelman, and Lily Renee. Creators like them form my comics DNA. It is comics creators like this which have inspired me to create works of visual activism such as my comic Right About Now that was centered around the Wisconsin Uprising and contribute to APB: Artists against Police Brutality. Now, I am focusing my attention on the human rights abuses happening at the Mexican border and I'm planning a trip to El Paso to meet with activists and immigrants on the frontlines and hear their stories and share them through the medium of comics. With your support, I can bring these voices to a wider audience which is yearning for such stories.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Show Don't Tell</h3>
<p>Any creative in a visual arts field will tell you, ""Show don't tell."" I've been working hard, finding this project a home while creating as much art as possible, you should have a taste of what you are in for. So here is what some of the book will look like:</p>

<h3>What will I do in El Paso</h3>
<p>While I'm in El Paso I hope to meet with a variety of activists, migrants, and institutions. Plans include seeing where there are people held in a tent in an underpass, the ICE tent city concentration camp, visiting the Holocaust and Border Patrol museums, and meeting people and learning how the city has changed in the past 20 years. I hope I can get a chance to see what it's like in the unforgiving desert where people are crossing.</p>
<p>I was born in El Paso. I only briefly returned twice in my life, once at the airport for a layover in the mid-80s and once for a day while on a cross country car ride in the early-90s. I remember stories my parents told me growing up and I want to contrast these stories with people's lived experience being in El Paso.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I was surprised at the number I came to when I sat down and did the math. I think it will cost me about $5,000 to do this. The biggest expense is what I need to go out to the desert. If I am to understand what is happening, I need to see the desert for myself. See the trails migrants go on. But I just can't show up like it's a day on the beach. The desert gets up as high as 114 degrees. To survive out there, even if it's a short trip, you need the right clothes. Doing the math, it looks like I need about $500, this includes proper hiking boots, a cooler hat (My current one is black. Looks awesome, but isn't going to help me stay cool in the heat.) and a water backpack.<br/><br/>Here is the break down:<br/>$2,000 for transportation, this is for the train ride down, a bus pass in El Paso, bike rental to get around downtown (El Paso has a public bike rental. I hope to get a room near the Holocaust Museum of El Paso it would be an easy bike ride from the hotel I'm looking at.), and, if needed, taxi fare. </p>
<p>$1000 for a room. It floors me how much these things add up.</p>
<p>$500 for meals. Part of it I will be on a train, so I imagine some of the meals will be pricey. </p>
<p>$500 for clothes for the desert. Also, the backpack water will come in handy for the bike rental.</p>
<p>$1000 for making the physical rewards for you! This also includes the all-important shipping supplies and postage.</p>
<p>I can't imagine not making this goal. However, the stretch goals, which I do have, could be a challenge.  I do have some exciting plans for this trip, which I'll announce when it's appropriate.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The end goal of this project is to give the reader an understanding of and the tools to fix the broken immigration system.</p>
<p>The concept around this came in evaluating the success and failures of Right About Now. This was a webcomic I wrote around the protests of Wisconsin. I tried to have a set of characters tell a broad story but it was too broad and I should have focused on how uniquely horrible Scott Walker's policies were. I knew that he was the harbinger of something worse. Instead of having a set of POV characters, I should have had them introduce other's stories. Overall, though, the experience of doing over 500 pages in two and a half years was a good one which taught me a lot.</p>
<p>This gave me the opportunity to be a part of APB Artists against Police Brutality. I was one of nearly 75 contributors and I worked with Aaron Rand Freeman (Formerly of The Week in Blackness and now Unreasonable Fridays podcasts.) on a six-page story for the book. I was super proud of the work I produced but the book was vague in bigger actions beyond what you as an individual can do. It's still an impressive book and I am proud that I worked on something that won the Pioneer Award at the 2016 Glyph Awards.</p>
<p>I hope that this project will surpass both of them in what I can learn as an artist and in finding an audience of both activists and comic book readers. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest risk of any of these things is not getting funded. I am worried that Trump supporters and those who support the wall will attack this page. But I think that over the years of working on projects like this, I feel I have built up a good community to combat any such attacks.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Those who have donated and those who financially can't help me, thank you for reading this far, but there is more you can do. The first thing that everyone should do is to reach out to your member of Congress about <a href=""https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/116/s662"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">S. 662: Fair Day in Court for Kids Act of 2019</a>,</p>
<p>If you have a podcast, news show, local paper or whatever, please invite me on to discuss this project and why the issues around the border. ""An artist,"" as Dwayne Boothe, or Mr. Fish as he signs his work, says, ""has less reason to lie for the power structure."" I feel my work for the past 8-years has shown a light on the power structure and this is a great way to promote the project. Plus I'd like to think I'm a good guest.</p>
<p>Of course, share this on all your social media channels. Any signal boosting can help and Indiegogo has made it easier for with the share tools. Plus, you can follow me on <a href=""https://twitter.com/rightaboutnow2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>I hope to get a special website for some previews with a special contributor's only blog where you can see art as well as the progress of the trip and art I make while I'm out there. So stay tuned for that.</p>
<p>And most importantly, thank you.</p>

<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<p>My name is Ryan, and I would like to share with you a short comic book project I've been working on over the last year. It's based on the Inuit legend <em>Sedna,</em> or alternatively named <em>Sanna: Goddess of the Sea</em>. The story is a coming-of-age tale about a young Inuit woman who refuses to marry a mysterious suitor and her journey of personal and physical transformation.</p>
<p>This project is important to me because it is my first serious attempt at crafting a story through the medium of comics. I think it is especially important to Canada and the world that this aboriginal story be shared. My art directors have helped me through the hardest part of the process; visual development, layout, pacing, and penciling. Now I hope that you will back me for adding the inks, colors, and text. If you can help meet our financial goal you will help in bringing this project full-circle. Please check out the comic in the gallery.</p>
<h2>What We Need &amp; The Impact</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>The money raised will allow me to focus on the project full-time. I feel a project like this deserves a focused momentum that will allow for my attention to detail. Every backer who contributes $5 and above will recieve a PDF digital copy of the 6 page full-color comic. Plus, for those that dig a bit deeper there is another side project that will add to the campaign to showcase the characters outside of their panels; a digital painting of each of the main characters as wallpapers, greeting cards, and prints would really illustrate how mythic they are! These 6 double-page spreads will also be featured in the comic. Overall I think the impact of the project will be positive and will encourage learning about the Inuit culture, reading, drawing, and making comics.</p>
</div>
<h2>Stretch Goals:</h2>
<p>I don't want to get too far ahead of myself, but I have to be open to the possibility of raising more than I am asking for. A couple of ideas floating around my head are enhancing the printed goods with holographic foil stamping to highlight the supernatural aspects of these characters. I am also interested in animating this comic book so that the panels move and provide an interactive experience.</p>

We presented to a fantastic audience, got rousing applause and most importantly, got southern hemisphere comics into the hands of the American market.                           Ah, the Heady Days of SDCC 2013We came back home, filled with pride and excitement that we had contributed to the rise of South African and Australian comics…But we soon realized that achieving the appropriate level of visibility for our small, yet vibrant industry won’t be achieved in a sprint. This is a marathon and it will take repeated rides on the merry-go-round and consistent work over time to build the international contacts that will enable our artists to achieve the next level. We say “industry” but what we mean is a comic scene - it will take a lot more work before it’s a comic industry. But right now, the momentum is there and NOW is the time to take the next step.With that in mind, we made it our mission to make lightning strike twice, and return to SDCC! (Guess we made a really good impression the first time around).We now have the opportunity to go back to SDCC to spread the word about South African & Australian comics. With a prime panel slot on Saturday the 26th of July 2014 and a bigger room, now there's an even BETTER avenue for exposure. This is where we now reach out to you. We believe in the abilities of the artists and creators from our countries, and if we could, we would take them all along. There’s only so much space in our suitcases though and US Customs is notoriously tough, so best we do this the proper way… which means finding more funds to bring artists from both South Africa and Australia along to gain the experience of networking with industry professionals at the biggest comic showcase in the world. Artists such as these guys: 
                                      Daniël Hugo and Chris BeukesDaniël Hugo is a Cape Town based artist and is a mainstay of the South African comic scene. He is the author of The Oneironaut & Other Tales  and The Souvenir. He has contributed to every Velocity to date.Chris Beukes is a freelance illustrator and erstwhile art director at South Africa's biggest commercial comic company. He is the author of Wrath.Last year we presented South African & Australian comics in a broader context, this year we are focusing on specific comics and how local creators are bringing in our local mythology, legends and culture into fantasy tales. As Neil Blomkamp did with District9 and Elysium except with a non-existent budget :) These are SOME of the fantastic books we’ll be talking about:The ImpactOur goal is to get our wonderful stories out into the world, and to do that, we need to hit the international market HARD. We will spam, nag and beg every possible avenue we can find to get your work into the hands of the  international market. What We Need & What You GetWe can't expect you to fork out your hard-earned cash and not give anything back, so check our many incentives for donating! Here are samples of work by the artists you can commission if you support our top tier perk.Other Ways You Can HelpPlease spread the word in any way that you can! We are all more than happy to appear on TV and radio interviews, dress up or to do tricks. We are also doing this via an NPO, so if you run a business and would like a tax break, we can hook you up. :)",7.0,0,"2 Campaigns

With the musicians and all the work that has gone into creating our show over the past 11 years, we have gone as far as we can at this level, but as i said earlier, the next step up is quite a big one. It's a very exciting project for me and i really want to create an amazing product.If I hit the target figure within 14 days I will give all the profit from my next show to charity. If I exceed target then I will donate excess funds to charity. So, by helping my project you will also be helping out a needing charity..how great is that?Come along and be a part of it on the filming day, in fact, i hope you will! It's a free afternoon in a great setting.Thanks youJames x x x x",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Gurukitty Studios is proud to announce that our second anthology is almost ready to be printed!</p>
<p>Our first anthology was called ""Ghost Tales"" and it has  over 200 copies distributed already in its short little life. woo hoo! The anthology has been at Calgary Expo, FanExpo Vancouver, Vancaf and countless other conventions over the last few months. Because the artists distribute and sell their own copies as well, the book has gotten sent all over the world, Hong Kong, Australia, United States, UK and Canada!<br/> Ghost Tales has 16 ghost stories from 20 artists and the books reader age is about... young teen. </p>
<p>When we first published Ghost Tales, we were not doing it for profit, and indeed no profit was made really, but thats okay; <strong>our goal with these anthologies is to give artists a chance to have some work published</strong> so they can make a little money doing what they love! :D</p>
<p>How the anthology projects we do work is that the artists are given a couple free copies and are able to order more at wholesale to earn money from their work. Gurukitty studios publishes and prints the books at our own expense.</p>
<p>Our money is mostly earned from convention and online shop sales as well as some random commissions. The rest we make up with our own personal money.This year's convention earnings were not as good as last years and we are going to need some help to raise the money to send out the artists copies and pre-orders this year.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong> Once Upon a time is a collection of 20 stories, all fairy / folk tale based! We will be posting sample pages Daily(ish) in the updates so you can get an idea of the variety and quality of the works in this volume!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Also I am trying to put some interviews with some of the artists about their work and their stories in this anthology!</strong></p>
<p><strong>We have several returning artists from Ghost Tales as well as some amazing new faces!</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/>This time we have barcodes, ISBN#'s and everything to make this book POS ready.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We've tried to step up our game, and make sure this time round is even better than the first!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What we need</strong></h2>
<p>Our total number of free issues we need to give out is approx 50 to give to the artists, the cover artists, the logo designer and a couple special thanks (approx $400-$500). Aside from that expense, we also need to ship these issues to the artists, some live international, some in the US, and some in Canada, believe it or not, that cost us MORE than paying for the copies to be printed ($500-$600).</p>
<p>So, we need money to help raise the cost of printing and shipping the payment copies to the artists and other people that helped make this book happen, as well as a few extra copies for in case situations and  to keep in stock to help us earn some money to buy stock for Calgary Expo 2013.</p>
<p>All totalled we've figured out that we need approx $900 ($400 printing, $500 shipping), the rest we could probably make up in our last few conventions this year.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">**An added note, this time round we are going to have a standard cover and a Variant cover! Previews are in the gallery on the tabs above! The variant is not going to be as readily available, it's a special edition and only available through this indigogo campaign and wont be available to order at any time like the standard! So if you are a fan of Jason Harts work, this is your last chance for a while to get the special cover!</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">***<strong>We will add updates with previews of some of the pages and other information periodically so you can see more of this project!</strong> Also, check out Gurukitty.com for more information!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Also, wether we recieve all our funding or not, this book WILL be printed and completed. Theres no doubt about that. Without extra funding, it just may take a little longer than we hoped.  Our goal was to have it out before October.</p>

<p>Hi! Jared Barel here from Loaded Barrel Studios and the artist and writer from our forthcoming graphic novel, BRIELLE AND THE HORROR, VOLUME 1. Brielle and the Horror first came about a long time ago in a galaxy far far-- okay, it was in New York in 2007 at the New York Comic Con where we first debuted our very first comic book Brielle and the Horror #1 about a 16 year old girl who must learn to control the demon inside of her before it brings about the end of the world. Here's what some folks thought about it:</p>
<p>The Haven awarded BRIELLE AND THE HORROR the honor of Best Book You've Never Heard Of in 2007 in its annual Top Comics awards.</p>
<p>""Now onto the book itself. It's frigging impressive. You could put it on the shelves beside most of the output from the big two, and this book, just production wise, will take em. Absolutely gorgeous book, and possibly the future of comics."" - Heroic Times</p>
<p></p>
<p>""'Brielle and the Horror' [is] the find of the last couple of years!... Heartwarming and haunting, this book introduces a talented new trio to the world of comics!"" - AmishOtaku.com</p>
<p>""'Brielle and the Horror' was our favorite book from the con, no doubt. It's just such a cool-looking book and great story, we absolutely loved it."" - N3RDCast</p>""What's interesting is just how well these guys have meshed making a movie and making a comic."" - Omnicomic<br/><p></p>
<p>After debuting BRIELLE and releasing the first couple chapters we tried our hand at making a full length graphic novel - GREY - about a city cop who moves to the country only to find out he's got trouble from an alien tormenting his town. GREY was the winner of the Silver Medal for Best Graphic Novel from the Independent Publishers Book Awards.</p>
<p></p>
<p>""Visually I instantly fell in love with <em>Grey</em> and found each turn of the page to be more awe-inspiring than the last... This is a must read graphic novel that will leave you attempting to sleep with one eye open for weeks to come."" - Comics Forge</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So we're wrapping up production on Brielle and the Horror Volume 1 right this very instant (seriously, even if it's 4 in the morning I'm still probably up working on it). All we are looking for now is help to cover the cost of printing. We just need a little help making this final push to get GREY to the New York Comic Con in October and on shelves in comic stores everywhere. </p>
<p>Obviously, it would be nice to raise the complete funds to cover all of the printing costs, but truthfully, every dollar will help. One way or another, this book is getting printed, so rest assured that every dollar you pledge will go directly toward that goal, even if we don't raise all of the funding that we're looking for here - this book will be printed.<br/></p>
<p>More important than any of that is all the cool stuff we're offering. Signed merch, limited edition and out of print items, hoodies, skateboards - really cool stuff... and if you look closely, you'll notice we've even taken out the big guns to offer you an original comic book of your very own to be published by Loaded Barrel Studios... oh, and there's that whole Loaded Barrel Studios producing your short film perk on the bottom... man, we're gonna have some fun.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our last graphic novel, GREY was an international hit having been translated into other languages, distributed overseas, and digitized for a number of different distributors. Brielle and the Horror is the story that launched our studio - it's time her whole story is told to the world. We're so excited to bring Brielle and the Horror to you. The fans that have supported us through the years have given us a tremendous push to keep moving forward. This is for you guys and for all the new fans we're about to meet. Thanks for your help and support!</p>

<h3>What's This All About?</h3>
<p>Hello! I'm Bonny Lee Hardgrove- artist, writer, and all-around nerd in various forms. I am delving into the fantastical world of comics with a brand new series with  entitled ""The Karvalas Brothers""- a duo team of paranormal Investigators. I have a unique artistic style and voice in the genre, and this is an excellent chance to be heard. The number one thing that any artist needs is also one of the hardest to obtain- a fan base. To build a fan base, one must go where the fans are, and that is at comic conventions. I need your help to get there. I want to get my work out there in the world, and comic con is where to do it.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Preparing for a comic con involves some heavy fundage. Booth rentals, promotional items such as posters, buttons, t-shirts, and of course, the comics themselves, runs high on the income of the typical starving artist. That's where you, the contributor, come in. With your help, I can raise the funds needed to attend the next Chicago Wizard World convention and get my artwork out to the people who will enjoy it the most. These are my people, and they deserve the best I can offer them. To acheive the absolute best requires more capital that is usually available to me. </p>
<p>Your contributions will also be used to update the equipment that I use to create the artwork. My outdated, opensource software and elderly computer work just fine for the small web comics available on my website (which can be seen at <a href=""http://www.bonnyleehardgrove.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.bonnyleehardgrove.com</a>), but I want to offer the fans something much more polished. Basically, for an endeavor such as this, I need to up my game. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Let's be frank...there aren't a whole lot of female comic artists out there. If this series becomes successful, wouldn't it be grand to add a female voice to the comic book canon? Your contributions will help make that happen, as well as add to the pop culture and fantasy worlds that we have all grown to love from our childhood and well into our adulthood.</p>

<h2>The Story So Far...</h2>
<p>In 2051, new technology has given rise to mankind's greatest invention, the afterlife. All it takes is a simple implant and upon your death, if you can afford it, your consciousness can be recovered and uploaded to Glory, a user-created paradise where any indulgence is possible. Miles Armstrong is a Recovery Agent, downloading the dead on the graveyard shift when he suddenly finds himself the target of a vast conspiracy that threatens to destroy Glory from within and without when one of the inventors of Glory is murdered on his shift.</p>
<h3>In This Issue...</h3>
<p>Miles, haunted by the trauma of his attack, begins to question everything he thought he understood about Glory and the loss of his brother. As he begins the long road to recovery, he seeks out answers to the mystery he's been thrown into.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Damascus, Journalist Tara Mitnick and her bodyguard Nakoa have to join forces with the cybernetic terrorist Amar Ahmadi to escape the city and the technological abominations that are pursuing them.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The requested funds are to cover<strong><i> production, printing, and shipping costs.</i></strong></p>
<p>In addition to a physical copy of this issue, we are also offering <strong><i>reprints of issue one, digital PDF versions </i></strong>as well as higher tiers that will include <strong><i>high-quality poster prints</i></strong> and <strong><i>original art pages</i></strong> drawn by Dennis Tirona.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Poster Prints For this Campaign</h2>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The main risk with a project in this stage would be unforeseen delays in production and printing. These things can happen and will be dealt with accordingly. This is our second campaign and we have a solid reputation for fulfillment.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553681227/w7xsschfyo7sysw050fb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Reader pics from our previous campaign for The Ferryman #1</i></p>
<p>The biggest concern to be aware of is for those who wish to buy original art pages. As Dennis is based outside of the U.S., there is always a chance that the pages may be lost or damaged in shipping. While unlikely, in the case that something should happen, refunds will be offered to those backers for the cost of the pages and they will receive all other purchased items in their tier.</p>

issue 2 cover art
The Story So Far...
In 2051, new technology has given rise to mankind's greatest invention, the afterlife. All it takes is a simple implant and upon your death, if you can afford it, your consciousness can be recovered and uploaded to Glory, a user-created paradise where any indulgence is possible. Miles Armstrong is a Recovery Agent, downloading the dead on the graveyard shift when he suddenly finds himself the target of a vast conspiracy that threatens to destroy Glory from within and without when one of the inventors of Glory is murdered on his shift.
In This Issue...
Miles, haunted by the trauma of his attack, begins to question everything he thought he understood about Glory and the loss of his brother. As he begins the long road to recovery, he seeks out answers to the mystery he's been thrown into.
Meanwhile, in Damascus, Journalist Tara Mitnick and her bodyguard Nakoa have to join forces with the cybernetic terrorist Amar Ahmadi to escape the city and the technological abominations that are pursuing them.

What We Need & What You Get
The requested funds are to cover production, printing, and shipping costs.
In addition to a physical copy of this issue, we are also offering reprints of issue one, digital PDF versions as well as higher tiers that will include high-quality poster prints and original art pages drawn by Dennis Tirona.
 
Poster Prints For this Campaign

 
Risks & Challenges
The main risk with a project in this stage would be unforeseen delays in production and printing. These things can happen and will be dealt with accordingly. This is our second campaign and we have a solid reputation for fulfillment.


Reader pics from our previous campaign for The Ferryman #1
The biggest concern to be aware of is for those who wish to buy original art pages. As Dennis is based outside of the U.S., there is always a chance that the pages may be lost or damaged in shipping. While unlikely, in the case that something should happen, refunds will be offered to those backers for the cost of the pages and they will receive all other purchased items in their tier.

<h3>The Creator</h3>
<p>Being a long time fan of comic books, Comic Art, and comic book movies; it was only a matter of time before Ray Zepeda would eventually turn his love for comics into a career choice. For the last decade Ray has been moving forward trying to make his dream a reality by pushing boundaries and launching Tragic Hero Comics in 2012! We have been building a story that means the world to us and hopefully to you guys too, but Tragic Hero Comics Publishing needs YOU now!</p>
<p>That's right! You can be heroes in your own right, simply by contributing to the campaign and collecting some awesome swag in the process! By helping the THC team bring the next epic chapter of AntiHero 113 to print, you can help us reach a wider audience, generate more interest in our content, and brake barriers that we never thought possible! </p>
<p>So from all of us, thanks in advance. We can't express what your loyalty and support mean to the team, the comic and Ray.</p>

<h3><strong>Our Story</strong></h3>
<p>An arcane society known as The Department of Advanced Research and Knowledge (D.A.R.K.), attempt to create the perfect army by secretly testing on American youth. The project was to usher the United States into a new era of superiority, technology, and most importantly...power.</p>
<p>As the project proceeded, things went from bad to worse -- most of the test subjects became increasingly unstable and violent thus steps were taken resulting in their immediate extermination and eventual shut down of the project...or so they thought.</p>
<p>In an unimaginable stroke of fate, 113 of the test subjects are discarded from the project due to an egregious oversight that ultimately saved them from the merciless massacre.</p>
<p><strong>Now: </strong>A small group of the ill-fated 113 have been thrown together by a series of events out of their control.  What happens when all these kids have, are each other, and the abilities that manifested in them after being cruelly experimented on by D.A.R.K.?</p>
<p>Get ready to find out how it all goes down in this explosive new chapter of AntiHero: 113!</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>AntiHero 113's Reviews...</strong></h3>
<p>So a lot of folks like to Post reviews from Pod Casts and Comic Book Reviewers, etc... but we take the opinions of our fans and supporters just seriously. Here's a few:</p>
<p>""Well personally I thought it was good and fantastic even with the characters development and with their powers based on their minds and not some chemical mishap and the art was good along with the plot hope you continue with it.""  -<strong>Damian D.</strong> ( Fan met at Stan Lee's Comikaze)</p>
<p>""Holy crap! I read the comics and love everything about it. The story's amazing and is driving me crazy that I don't know what's going to happen next so when you come out with more please tell me because I want to read more!""  -<strong>Joseph S.</strong> (First time comic book reader met at The Latino Comics Expo)</p>
<p>""Antihero has the right amount of suspense to keep you wanting more! At the end, it leaves you with the cliff hanger affect. The illustrations are great too! As a woman, you're not left feeling objectified, Kuddos!  -<strong>Alicia E</strong> (Fourth Grade Teacher)</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Discover the dark origins of <em>Redorik</em>! Crystal Fractal Comics presents the origin story of Justin Henderson, a high school senior struggling to juggle the stresses of his social life with his blossoming dark, mystical powers. While leading a normal life on the surface, what dwells deep within him threatens to push him over the edge. Will Justin succeed and become the hero he can be, or will the dark voices in his head push him past salvation?</p>
<p><strong>The Project</strong></p>
<p><em>Redorik</em> is a comic book project years in the making, set within the Crystal Fractal Comics universe(CFU). Tying directly into our other titles, <em>Redorik </em>is an essential piece of our greater vision for our comic book world.  Series writer Howard Wong describes the title as not being the traditional superhero tale, one that’s filled with surprises around every corner as the main character, Justin Henderson, does his best to deal with the struggles of adolescent life while coming to terms with his emerging powers. Justin’s world is defined by shades of grey as he deals with being bullied at school, death, love and power. With that comes a moral greyness Justin must overcome, ultimately being faced with decisions that will either shape his world for the better, or drown it in darkness.</p>

<p><strong>The Campaign</strong></p>
<p>The first issue of the book is completed and was actually released as <em>Redorik #1 </em>in 2011. The book is also plotted through the fourth issue. Where we need that extra push is finishing the artwork. Series artist Pedro Maia provided his amazing talents in the first installment and we’d love to bring him back to finish our story. The trade as a whole is about 50 per cent done, we just need that “home stretch"" push to get this great story that we’re all very passionate about finished and in your hands.</p>
<p>Because we appreciate every donation, no matter if it’s $1 or $1,001,  a single contribution of any dollar amount will guarantee you a spot on our contributors list of donors on the inside pages of the finished trade.  While any amount can be contributed, we do have a number of great perks (or benchmarks) available to you as an extra “thank you” for your help.</p>
<p><strong><strong>The Impact</strong></strong></p>
<p>The economics of the comics business don’t necessarily allow for much success, no matter how dedicated a following a creator has. The <em>Redorik </em>series was such a casualty.  We originally had to put the book on the backburner, but after some soul searching it's one of the books we feel most strongly about and wanted to finish. We have the first issue completed, and the following three issues are completely scripted. Any contributions to the campaign will go toward:</p>
<p>-Finishing the final three issues worth of artwork</p>
<p>-Publishing and printing costs for the new graphic novel</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">The Story</h2>
<p>For two decades, New Astoria was shielded from the violent disturbances of villainous super-humans by the chivalrous &amp; indestructible protector, <strong>Captain Valor</strong>. He served the city with unconditional love and endless overwhelming pride, effortlessly able to break all barriers of reality, ripping through the skies at untouchable speeds with the hero's intuition of always seeming to be in the right place at the right time. His strength and fortitude were unmatched, and his courage, unchallengeable.</p>
<p>As Captain Valor was destroying a soul stone that granted a villain the powers of darkness, corruption, and the ability to reconstruct the dead, his body inadvertently absorbed the ruinous energy from the stone, mutating the hero into the all-powerful, uncontrollable, carnivorous anti-human<strong>, Devour</strong>. In fear of destroying the city and it's inhabitants that he had given his life for, he locked himself away beneath the city in the <strong>sewers</strong>, left only to feed off of plagued rats and other diseased vermin. He now loses more of himself every day, his mind deteriorating... left to embrace old news clippings and photos that remind himself of who he once was.

This is the campaign to fund SUPER DEAD !!







The Story
For two decades, New Astoria was shielded from the violent disturbances of villainous super-humans by the chivalrous & indestructible protector, Captain Valor. He served the city with unconditional love and endless overwhelming pride, effortlessly able to break all barriers of reality, ripping through the skies at untouchable speeds with the hero's intuition of always seeming to be in the right place at the right time. His strength and fortitude were unmatched, and his courage, unchallengeable.
As Captain Valor was destroying a soul stone that granted a villain the powers of darkness, corruption, and the ability to reconstruct the dead, his body inadvertently absorbed the ruinous energy from the stone, mutating the hero into the all-powerful, uncontrollable, carnivorous anti-human, Devour. In fear of destroying the city and it's inhabitants that he had given his life for, he locked himself away beneath the city in the sewers, left only to feed off of plagued rats and other diseased vermin. He now loses more of himself every day, his mind deteriorating... left to embrace old news clippings and photos that remind himself of who he once was. It would all have been worth it to him as long as they remembered what he'd sacrificed to prevent the annihilation, and what he had lost to guarantee their survival...
10 years later... a new hero, Omega Atlas, has replaced Captain Valor... and vengeance begins to take form below the city's surface...

<p><b><b><b><b>[EN]<i> QUEBRADA - SECOND FALL</i></b><i> is the second miniseries of the brand-new comic label ATOMICO. It’s a lucha libre-themed 80-page hard-boiled adventure written by </i><b>Matteo Casali </b><i>and drawn by </i><b>Mick Bertilorenzi</b><i>, with flamboyant cover art by </i><b>Giuseppe Camuncoli</b><i>.</i></b></b></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Quebrada </b>is a dangerous frontier city, the northern capital of the Lucha Libre scene, the action-packed Mexican version of wrestling that has made masked grapplers, the Luchadors, popular all around the world ever since the late 1950s. People of all ages fill the arenas and auditorios every week to watch their heroes, the Tecnicos, take on the hated and violent quintessential bad guys, the Rudos. The powerful Alianza de Lucha Libre (ALL) wrestling promotion holds many shows every week to feed the constant hunger for the violence and theatrics which the crowds crave.</p>
<p>But in Quebrada, the violence is not always staged, like in the other wrestling rings of the world.</p>
<p>Everybody knows the Champions fighting between the ropes is but the tip of the iceberg. And few dare to say it’s just a facade, the “official” way of settling scores that cut deep into the city’s underbelly.Quebrada is a true crime capital, where Clans led by masked Luchadors fight ruthlessly to control the riches and illegal activities that flow through the city and across the nearby American border. Be it in the ring, where the crowd cheers their names, or on the dangerous streets of Quebrada, young men and women try to take down their opponents, gaining fame and fortune when they win.<br/><br/>And death when they fail.</p>

<p><b>Quebrada </b>es una ciudad de frontera, la capital de la Lucha Libre mexicana y de sus
luchadores enmascarados, popular en todo el mundo desde hace 60 años.</p>
<p>Cada semana gente de todas las edades llena las arenas y los
auditorios para verasus propios héroes, los Técnicos, mientras que luchan contra los odiados y violentos Rudos, y la federación Alianza de Lucha Libre (ALL) organiza varios espectáculos semanales para satisfacer
la sed de violencia y teatralidad del público.</p>
<p>La diferencia entre la
violencia que anima las luchas en Quebrada y los espectáculos de todo el mundo es el hecho que ésta no siempre es falsa.</p>
<p>Todo el mundo sabe que un
campeón que sube al ring sólo es la parte visible de un sistema corrupto que
persiste en la ciudad, pero son pocos los que se atrevian a decirlo.De hecho las luchas constituyen
cada día más una representación pública de lacontienda entre clanes rivalesque
infecta el vientre de la ciudad.</p>
<p>Quebrada es la capital del
crimen, donde los clanes,
guiados por luchadores enmascarados, luchan para controlar las riquezas y las
actividades ilegales que atraviesan la ciudad hasta que no crucen la frontera de
Estados Unidos </p>
<p>Todo esto pasa en el ring y en
las calles, donde hombres y
mujeres enmascarados ganan fama y dinero. O mueren intentando hacerlo.</p>

È un'avventura hard-boiled di 80 pagine a colori in formato comic book, dedicato alla Lucha Libre messicana.Sceneggiatura di Matteo Casali e disegni di Michele Bertilorenzi con le copertine di Giuseppe Camuncoli.Quebrada è una pericolosa città di frontiera, la capitale della Lucha Libre, versione messicana del wrestling che ha reso i suoi lottatori mascherati, i Luchador, celebri in tutto il mondo dalla fine degli anni ’50. Ogni settimana, un pubblico formato da gente di tutte le età riempie le arene e gli auditorios per vedere i suoi eroi, i Tecnicos, affrontare gli odiati e violenti cattivi, i Rudos. La potente federazione di wrestling Alianza de Lucha Libre (ALL) tiene diversi spettacoli settimanali per sfamare il bisogno costante di violenza e teatralità del pubblico.Ma a Quebrada, la violenza non è sempre finta come quella messa in scena sui ring del resto del mondo.Tutti sanno che un Campione che sale tra le corde è solo la punta dell’iceberg di quello che in realtà succede. Pochi osano dire che si tratta solo di una facciata, un modo “ufficiale” di chiudere le faide che scavano in profondità il ventre corrotto della città.Quebrada è una vera capitale del crimine, dove i Clan guidati da Luchador mascherati si battono ferocemente per controllare le ricchezze e le attività illegali che passano attraverso la città per superare, infine, il vicino confine con gli Stati Uniti. Accade sul ring, dove le folle gridano i loro nomi, e sulle strade di Quebrada, dove uomini e donne mascherati cercano di abbattere i loro avversari, guadagnando fama e fortuna vincendo.O morendo provandoci.



[EN] QUEBRADA - SECOND FALL is the second miniseries of the brand-new comic label ATOMICO. It’s a lucha libre-themed 80-page hard-boiled adventure written by Matteo Casali and drawn by Mick Bertilorenzi, with flamboyant cover art by Giuseppe Camuncoli.

Quebrada is a dangerous frontier city, the northern capital of the Lucha Libre scene, the action-packed Mexican version of wrestling that has made masked grapplers, the Luchadors, popular all around the world ever since the late 1950s. People of all ages fill the arenas and auditorios every week to watch their heroes, the Tecnicos, take on the hated and violent quintessential bad guys, the Rudos. The powerful Alianza de Lucha Libre (ALL) wrestling promotion holds many shows every week to feed the constant hunger for the violence and theatrics which the crowds crave.
But in Quebrada, the violence is not always staged, like in the other wrestling rings of the world.
Everybody knows the Champions fighting between the ropes is but the tip of the iceberg. And few dare to say it’s just a facade, the “official” way of settling scores that cut deep into the city’s underbelly.Quebrada is a true crime capital, where Clans led by masked Luchadors fight ruthlessly to control the riches and illegal activities that flow through the city and across the nearby American border. Be it in the ring, where the crowd cheers their names, or on the dangerous streets of Quebrada, young men and women try to take down their opponents, gaining fame and fortune when they win.And death when they fail.







[ES] QUEBRADA - SEGUNDA
CAÍDA es la segunda miniserie del nuevo proyecto editorial independiente
ATOMICO. Es una aventura hard-boiled de 80 páginas en color en formato comic book sobre la Lucha
Libre mexicana.
Guión de Matteo Casali,
dibujos de Michele Bertilorenzi y cubiertas dibujadas por Giuseppe Camuncoli.
Quebrada es una ciudad de frontera, la capital de la Lucha Libre mexicana y de sus
luchadores enmascarados, popular en todo el mundo desde hace 60 años.
Cada semana gente de todas las edades llena las arenas y los
auditorios para verasus propios héroes, los Técnicos, mientras que luchan contra los odiados y violentos Rudos, y la federación Alianza de Lucha Libre (ALL) organiza varios espectáculos semanales para satisfacer
la sed de violencia y teatralidad del público.
La diferencia entre la
violencia que anima las luchas en Quebrada y los espectáculos de todo el mundo es el hecho que ésta no siempre es falsa.
Todo el mundo sabe que un
campeón que sube al ring sólo es la parte visible de un sistema corrupto que
persiste en la ciudad, pero son pocos los que se atrevian a decirlo.De hecho las luchas constituyen
cada día más una representación pública de lacontienda entre clanes rivalesque
infecta el vientre de la ciudad.
Quebrada es la capital del
crimen, donde los clanes,
guiados por luchadores enmascarados, luchan para controlar las riquezas y las
actividades ilegales que atraviesan la ciudad hasta que no crucen la frontera de
Estados Unidos 
Todo esto pasa en el ring y en
las calles, donde hombres y
mujeres enmascarados ganan fama y dinero. O mueren intentando hacerlo.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Overground Comics still has a loyal following, and we've delivered on every crowd-funded campaign that we've launched.  We'd really like to get this book out there for those who missed the individual issues during circulation. Plus Ultra is a story for everyone. We all make mistakes, we all make bad choices, but we're all capable of learning and becoming more than we already are. That's what this story is about.  Please help us get that story to more readers by helping us fund this campaign.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is a collection of a book that was previously published in an issue by issue format, so there are no risks involved in this project.  The work is already done, we're just collecting it all together for the first time. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are excited about the project but you can't contribute, you can still help us by spreading the word.  Please help us tell everyone that we're offering this great book!</p>

<p>Hi, I'm Dan Pavelich, creator of the comic strip ""Just Say Uncle."" I've been creating the strip for GoComics since 2013. Over the years, people have often asked me when the first compilation book would come out, and now seems like a really good time to do it. The book will contain all 130 full-color strips that appeared during that first year. We are only printing enough copies to cover pre-orders, so if you'd like a copy, make sure you order by the deadline.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It's been interesting for me to go back and look at the strips. You can tell that I was finding my footing that first year, but I knew it could really develop into something worthwhile. While my sense of humor has remained the same since the beginning, I think you'll notice how the artwork has continued to improve.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I hope that you'll consider ordering a copy or two, and sharing Just Say Uncle with someone who might appreciate it, yet be unfamiliar with it. Let's take a look back and have a laugh...</p>
<p>My most sincere thanks,</p>
<p>Dan Pavelich</p>

Le difficoltà si moltiplicano ancor di più per chi come noi è una realtà molto piccola e che fa affidamento quasi esclusivamente sulle fiere del fumetto per portare ai lettori le nuove produzioni.MA NEMMENO QUESTI OSTACOLI POSSONO FERMARE UN APPENDINO CHE ARDE D'AMORE PER I FUMETTI!Vi presentiamo quindi...L'ATTACCAPANNI MARKET è la nostra risposta: un crowdfunding unico per presentare i tre titoli nuovi di quest'anno e farli arrivare a casa dei lettori in tutta sicurezza!Sarà possibile scegliere, tra i perk base e gli add-on, i libri che più vi interessano e comporre il vostro pacchetto personalizzato, proprio come fareste in fiera. L'unica cosa che manca è il piacere di incontrarvi di persona: a quello speriamo di poter porre rimedio al più presto!Quest'anno non ci sarà un solo libro in crowdfunding, ma ben TRE!Il primo è il nostro titolo di punta, il volume che chiude un viaggio iniziato nel 2016 e che volevamo realizzare da molto tempo: GRIMORIO III.Dopo le streghe del primo volume e i fantasmi del secondo, ora è tempo di mostri. Fedeli allo spirito dei precedenti, Grimorio III unisce storie e illustrazioni umoristiche a momenti inquietanti, seri, commoventi o surreali. Interamente a colori, questo splendido volume riunisce sotto la meravigliosa copertina firmata da Simone D'Armini un vero esercito di talenti: Alessandra Marsili, Andrea De Dominicis, Ariel Vittori, Dimitri Fogolin, Eleonora Bruni, Erneste, Fabio Mancini, Helena Masellis, Laura Guglielmo e Sara Silvera Darnich, Loris De Marco, Margherita Castello, Marta Bertello, Martina Batelli, Martina Fari, Martina Mastroieni, Mirko Failoni e Veronica Ciancarini.Grimorio III è un'antologia imperdibile per gli amanti del paranormale, gli appassionati di storie brevi e gli affezionati all'appendino. E se il libro da solo non vi bastasse?Per voi abbiamo anche questa mostruosa enamel pin: l'accessorio perfetto per ogni occasione che richieda quel tocco di inquietudine in più, disegnato dalla nostra Laura Guglielmo.Non siete in vena di mostruose presenze ed episodi disturbanti? Preferireste sistemarvi in poltrona, sorseggiare qualcosa di fresco e rilassarvi? Niente paura, abbiamo pensato anche a voi: Day Off parla dei momenti di relax dei supereroi. Attenzione però: come sempre quando si parla di eroi, non sempre le cose vanno secondo i piani!Questa mini raccolta di 68 pagine tutte a colori raccoglie storie che parlano di straordinaria quotidianità e di cosa significa staccare e ricaricare le batterie quando si fa un mestiere del tutto fuori dal comune. E fuori dal comune sono anche gli autori che hanno prestato le loro valenti matite a questo progetto: Martina Naldi, Ste Tirasso, Williams Obrou Zouzouo, Veronica 'Veci' Carratello, Susanna Rumiz e Laura Guglielmo, Gabriele Peddes e Ariel Vittori, con una strepitosa copertina di Veronica Ruffato.Day Off è un libro pieno di momenti dolci e momenti amari, che invita a riflettere anche mentre si sta ancora sorridendo: abbiamo adorato seguire la sua realizzazione e siamo sicuri che lo amerete anche voi!Tra le pagine di Clessidra come sempre si esplorano storie umane e il rapporto col tempo.Il terzo numero del nostro periodico arriva sulle scene con un tema ambizioso: un minuto, un giorno, un anno, un secolo.Lorenzo Ghetti ci racconta cosa si dicono due ragazzi durante un minuto di oscurità a bordo di una stazione spaziale, Arianna Climaci narra delle peripezie di un trio di goblin al servizio di un signore del male nel corso della giornata che li separa dalla resurrezione del loro padrone, Sara Marino percorre l'anno di incertezze, cambiamenti e crescita di una ragazza che ha visto il proprio futuro (un futuro possibile, ma chissà se reale) in sogno, e Laura Guglielmo segue una dinastia di scultori, che nel corso di un secolo di lavoro lotta con la realizzazione di un misteriosa e immaginifica statua, commissionata da un cliente tanto prestigioso quanto volubile. Tra i perk base abbiamo anche preparato tre pacchetti speciali a prezzo scontato per chi desidera acquistare più libri: l'intera trilogia di Grimorio, i tre libri nuovi del 2020 o i tre numeri di Clessidra.Che dire, tre è veramente il numero perfetto!E per gli add-on?Sono disponibili:
Grimorio III
Day Off
Clessidra 3

Missione compiuta! Grazie, amico lettore!La risposta a questa domanda è molto banale: serviranno essenzialmente per finanziare la stampa di Grimorio III. Il terzo numero di Clessidra e Day Off sono già stati stampati a spese nostre, mentre Grimorio III (essendo molto più corposo degli altri due titoli) ha bisogno di aiuto.Il goal di quest'anno è più basso del solito perché abbiamo deciso di produrre un solo gadget e di concentrarci invece sul cercare di distribuire meglio che possiamo il prodotto che ci sta veramente a cuore, cioè I LIBRI.I fondi quindi copriranno la stampa di Grimorio III, la produzione della spilletta e la spedizione di tutti gli ordini.Se vogliamo sopravvivere come etichetta a questo annus horribilis dobbiamo rimboccarci le mani e trovare nuove soluzioni per continuare a produrre le antologie che amiamo e soprattutto riuscire a venderle: come sempre è coi soldi ricavati dalla vendita che paghiamo i nostri artisti, senza il cui straordinario lavoro nulla di tutto questo sarebbe mai possibile.Il rischio maggiore per l'Attaccapanni Press quest'anno è, detto in parole povere, non vendere un singolo libro: le fiere sono sempre state e sempre saranno la nostra occasione di distribuzione, e senza di loro Attaccapanni non incassa un quattrino da Lucca 2019.Abbiamo investito parecchio per non abbandonare i progetti che avevamo in programma: è solo col vostro aiuto che possiamo vincere questa scommessa.",17.0,0,"8 Campaigns

The RisksThis is a flexible campaign, so no matter the outcome, the comic book will be printed! Only it will take longer then it would with full crowdfunding. If this campaign fails to reach its goal, I’ll print it the traditional way, through bank loans and deals. If you, as a backer, paid for your printed book or any other product, you will get what you paid for.We have much to do after printing, but if this campaign is successful, No North, the next big adventure of Steban and Martin, might come sooner!I thank you for your time and support, and wish you the most wonderful adventures ahead!",17.0,0,"2 Campaigns

visiting her Australian cousin named Banjo, an engineering student who has
entered his revolutionary new car in the ‘Solar Trial’. (This is based on the
real ‘Solar Challenge’ race that runs 3,000km from Darwin to Adelaide). Banjo’s
high-tech car gets the attention of a big-wig executive who works for a
fictitious multi-national oil company. The oil exec puts his sinister plans
into action. Banjo and Ruby are hijacked mid-race and it’s up to Jasper to
track them down, encountering dangerous, colourful and sometimes funny native
Aussie animals of the outback along the way. </span></p><p></p></span><p></p>

the text and assembling the book for print. Why does it take me this long?
Well, most graphic novels this size are created by a team of writers, artists,
colourists etc. My books are created by a team of 2. I do all the writing,
artwork and colour and my partner Kay handles all the lettering and technical
production. I’m excited with how <i>Solar Trial</i></span><span style=""font-family: Arial;""> is looking and can’t wait to get it finished for

Belgium's Herge, the creator of Tintin.  I remember when I discovered Tintin in
the school library at the age of 9. I devoured them! I loved Herge's realistic
artwork and the humour in his characters. They inspired me to create my own
comics that I worked on in my spare time all the way through High School. My

Hi, I’m Glen Lovett, the author/artist of the ‘The Adventures of
Jasper’ graphic novel
series. I’m currently working on the 3rd volume ‘Jasper and the
Solar Trial’ and need
your help to get it finished.
The books are published through my company Lovett Pictures
Inc. here in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. The Jasper books are 48 pages
full- colour action/adventure comic albums, similar in style to Herge’s Tintin.
Volume 1 – ‘Lost in Skookum Valley’ and volume 2 – ‘Secrets of the Petroglyph’ were both gold medal winners at the
Independent Publisher Book Awards in LA, 2008 and New York, 2011. The French
version of volume 1 – ‘Perdus dans la Skookum Valley’ was published last year. You can check
them out at: www.jaspercomics.com 

http://www.jaspercomics.com/blog/ 
The Goal
I have recently completed all of the rough page layouts
for ‘Jasper and the Solar Trial’ and now looking to raise $15,000 (CAN) to help cover my expenses as I work
over the next 6 months to complete all the inking, colouring and lettering. The funds raised will also go towards the cost of the perks, packaging, and Indiegogo fees.   If the planets align and the Indiegogo universe sends
even more $ than the initial goal, the extra funds will be put to good use
printing 1000 copies of 'Solar Trial'. 


The Story
In book 3, Ruby is
visiting her Australian cousin named Banjo, an engineering student who has
entered his revolutionary new car in the ‘Solar Trial’. (This is based on the
real ‘Solar Challenge’ race that runs 3,000km from Darwin to Adelaide). Banjo’s
high-tech car gets the attention of a big-wig executive who works for a
fictitious multi-national oil company. The oil exec puts his sinister plans
into action. Banjo and Ruby are hijacked mid-race and it’s up to Jasper to
track them down, encountering dangerous, colourful and sometimes funny native
Aussie animals of the outback along the way. 
It’s taken me over a year to complete all the rough pencil layouts for Solar
Trial. Now that’s done it’ll take me
another 6 months or more to complete all the inking linework, colouring, adding
the text and assembling the book for print. Why does it take me this long?
Well, most graphic novels this size are created by a team of writers, artists,
colourists etc. My books are created by a team of 2. I do all the writing,
artwork and colour and my partner Kay handles all the lettering and technical
production. I’m excited with how Solar Trial is looking and can’t wait to get it finished for
Jasper readers asap!




Glen who?
The
Adventures of Jasper
combines my love of  Siberian Huskies with my passion for comics,
specifically European comics in the clear-line style pioneered decades ago by
Belgium's Herge, the creator of Tintin.  I remember when I discovered Tintin in
the school library at the age of 9. I devoured them! I loved Herge's realistic
artwork and the humour in his characters. They inspired me to create my own
comics that I worked on in my spare time all the way through High School. My
early comic work helped land my first job as a trainee layout artist with a
Sydney animation company.
Originally from Australia, I moved to Canada in 1994 with my partner Kay, also an animation artist and painter, and our first Husky named Ruby. Since then we've worked from our home-based
studio in the wilds of East Sooke BC creating storyboards and designs for
animation companies in Canada, the U.S. and Australia. Disney TV, Warner Bros,
 Hanna Barbera, Nelvana, Nickelodeon and Atomic Cartoons are just some of the
studios we've worked for over that time. We also added to our team of Huskies
over the years, fostering (which to us usually means keeping) rescues. This
obviously, is where the inspiration for my comic Jasper comes from.
The Perks






We have lots of perks to send out to Jasper supporters as soon as the
campaign ends! No waiting for books to get finished, published or printed and
there’s no extra postage charges. Postage costs are built into the rewards. We
have prints, posters, ebooks, signed printed books in stock and signed original
artwork ready to go. (By the way, these perks would make excellent Christmas
gifts too! Just sayin…) 
We've also added Vol 3 'Jasper and the Solar Trial' which should be available by June next year. If you don't mind the wait, you'll receive a signed copy of one of the first 100 printed books at the $85 perk level. Includes postage to anywhere and you'll have Vol 1 and Vol 2 ebooks to read in the meantime.
PERK UPDATE BONUS:  
Perks from $25 and up will include all 3 ebooks!


A few reviews…

The
Jasper series offer exciting and wholesome entertainment. I loved it and my
seven year old daughter has started to demand that we get a husky for her. And
along with Asterix and Tintin - Jasper will soon make it into the triumvirate
of international comic albums.
 Excerpt from Review by Narayan Radhakrishnan for
Rebecca's Reads (5/2013) 
We
received the two copies this morning. They look great, especially with the
award medals on the cover! Thanks again, and I look forward to hand selling
these and ordering more.
 Annie Leonard, Manager, The Next Chapter Bookstore
Iowa USA
I
stumbled on your Jasper comic visiting Whitehorse this weekend. Lovely work.
You have a real Herge feel for story blocking and perspective. Look forward to
seeing more.

As his contact list grew, so did his interest in the  complete field of comic. Starting up a Bad Grrl Comics Fan club in 2001  was the first step to go further then his own living room. Soon  thereafter he began setting up websites for Arthur Suydam, Eric  Basaldua, Broadsword Comics and focussing on titles like Vampirella,  Cavewoman, Hack/Slash and more... He even started working with the FACTS comicon organization where he also met the founder of Broken Frontier and  shortly thereafter began doing headlines for this news site.

His road to creating comic books, though, took several detours. After graduation he had to admit to himself that it would be next to impossible to make a living by drawing comics in Germany, and relocating to the US wasn't really an option, even though at this point his drawing abilities were quite good. So he spent the next 20 years in the dreary profession of a graphics deisgner. It took a pep talk from fan-favorite artist Greg Capullo during a book signing in Frankfurt to get Markus back on track; after being told that in the meantime, the ""bullpens"" at the publishers had ceased to exist: all you needed nowadays to break into comics were talent, a scanner and an internet connection. With newfound enthusiasm, determined to take the comic book world by storm (or, failing that, a gentle breeze), Markus set out to find a partner-in-crime - enter Richard Boom, who was happy to take Markus aboard. Initially (and rather inadvertently) he took on the role of story editor, trying to bring some sort of order and continuity to she sprawling wealth of material that represented the ""Sisterhood"" universe. Hungry to get his teeth into the actual creation of art, he took the script for a 10-page story apart at the seams (with the blessing of original author Viktor Kruithof) and hammered it into a full-length comic book story. These pages will see print as Sisterhood #2 sometime in the spring of 2020, and, as life sometimes comes full-circle, will feature a variant cover by none other than Greg Capullo.</p><p><strong>Renee Rienties: story 2 penciller</strong></p><p>Renee Rienties is an independent comic artist from the Netherlands.                She made her start in the world of comics in 2016 with her smallpress book “My Daily Life Comics” which was received well by her readers online and at comic conventions.                In 2017 her art took a dark turn, from funny cute gag comics to creepy bloody horror. Here she worked on a story in “Oyasumi” A manga collaboration she started with two fellow artists.

Where she drew her comic “Distortia”  Her creepy art will leave a chilling impression for you to remember.                In 2018 she worked on a chilling short story in the “Hollandsch Manga” anthology series made by various Dutch artists.                If mystery, thriller and horror are your thing, then you have something to look forward to. Right now Renee is working on a new chilling book that will come out end of 2019.               GUEST ARTISTS:RALF VAN DER HOEVEN is an autodidact if you ever seen one. Hailing from the Netherlands, he is a well-received artist in the fantasy- and comic-community.After doing illustration work for Valkyrie and Artvlam he started a company with the Belgian Dominiek Vermandere called Lakoro. With Dominiek he's co-owner and creator of the new comicbook series for all ages named: Troltrol. (www.troltrol.be)The first dutch book was recently published and is available.Besides that Ralf fills his time making several variant covers for Dark Dragon Books (The dutch-translated Deadpool and Lady Mechanika).His dream of creating an original comicbook of his own is taking shape in his free time and besides that he's putting together his first ever fantasy artbook via Dutch Publisher Dark Dragon Books Art Collection.ART GRAFUNKEL is designer by day, doodlemonkey by night, Belgian Waffle by birth, and nerdy by nature.His  geeky artwork has been featured in VISIONS FROM THE UPSIDE DOWN: A  STRANGER THINGS ARTBOOK (Del Rey), TRANSMETROPOLITAN: ALL AROUND THE  WORLD (CBLDF), WORMWOOD: GENTLEMAN CORPSE (IDW) and he's doodled  sketchcards for STAR WARS GALAXY and MARS ATTACKS (Topps). He is a comicon-regular and brings smiles to folks he knows as well as folks he does not...          He also thinks it's pretty pretentious, writing all of this third person.ROBIN MIES is a Dutch illustrator, sketch card and comic artist.In recent years he has made various sketch card sets under his own management, but he has also been able to draw for, among others, Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2 and Thor: Ragnarok. Partly because of this, his illustrated blank covers are becoming increasingly popular.",21.0,0,"9 Campaigns

<h3>Hey there.</h3>
<p>It's Blake. I'm the creator and writer of <i><strong>""The Saga of Evil Monkey Man!""</strong></i>  I can hardly tell you how thankful I am for all the support we've had over the last few years for this crazy monkey project. As many of you know, it has literally been years in the making. From the New York Comic Con down to MegaCon Orlando we've met so many supportive folks, and here online we're approaching 4,000 followers! It is truly magical to be able to make Frank's song, and my characters, come to life.</p>
<p>Where we're at now is completing what I'm calling ""Season One."" It's the first four of twelve ""episodes"" of <i><strong>""The Saga of Evil Monkey Man!""</strong></i>  The story and most of the (over 80 pages) of art are done - so we're turning once again to you...family, friends &amp; fans to help fund the printing of the individual issues, as well as our first trade paperback (which collects all four stories into one larger book.) Once we have actual physical copies, I can and will travel from city to city promoting <strong>Evil Monkey Man</strong>.</p>
<p>We can't do all this without you. Your contributions literally make this happen.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1563454159/gcubc1j7ddykm222y8we.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get.</h3>
<p>We're looking to raise at least $500.00 in order to print enough copies of issues 2-4 as well as the trade. Any additional monies will simply mean more copies for more promotion. With all of this, eventually <strong>Evil Monkey Man</strong> will become a household name - and it all started and starts right here - with  you.</p>
<p>This time around we have a couple of really exciting, exclusive perks to share, including a signed print to accompany the trade paperback. Series artist Butch Mapa literally traveled all the way from the Philippines just to sign these prints! (Actually, he was in town to visit family and attend a wedding, but for the purposes of this campaign, we'll go with he came here to sign these prints story. And, by the way, these are Butch's first-ever signed prints!) We'll also be offering an exclusive poster, as well as original art by myself, and Russ Braun (who has drawn for Disney, DC &amp; Marvel in addition to, and perhaps most famously for, the new Amazon TV series <i><strong>""The Boys.""</strong></i>) And for those hardcore fans among you - you can actually get drawn into one or more upcoming episodes!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1563454198/lmzujlvi1lbycpnv54p4.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact.</h3>
<p><i><strong>""The Saga of Evil Monkey Man"" </strong></i> is a really cool, all-ages comic book (if I don't say so myself) based on the FL!NG Lo!S tune by Frank. It's got all the elements of those classic adventures that we either grew up with or are now enjoying on the big screen and TV. Lovable, relatable characters on a quest, helping our main protagonist Mike find his way back to being human. It's a time-traveling reality-bending romp, criss-crossing North America with innumerable easter-eggs and some esoteric surprises. And you need a few copies. I'm sure of it.</p>
<p>This will be our second (and hopefully second <i>successful</i>) campaign for <strong>Evil Monkey Man</strong> along with successful campaigns for <strong>Witch Hunter</strong> and <strong>The Last.</strong> Under the Monarch Comics imprint we've been selling out at conventions and later this year we will be distributed to BAM! (Books-A-Million.) But again, it all starts here, with your contribution.

</div></div>","Hey there.
It's Blake. I'm the creator and writer of ""The Saga of Evil Monkey Man!""  I can hardly tell you how thankful I am for all the support we've had over the last few years for this crazy monkey project. As many of you know, it has literally been years in the making. From the New York Comic Con down to MegaCon Orlando we've met so many supportive folks, and here online we're approaching 4,000 followers! It is truly magical to be able to make Frank's song, and my characters, come to life.
Where we're at now is completing what I'm calling ""Season One."" It's the first four of twelve ""episodes"" of ""The Saga of Evil Monkey Man!""  The story and most of the (over 80 pages) of art are done - so we're turning once again to you...family, friends & fans to help fund the printing of the individual issues, as well as our first trade paperback (which collects all four stories into one larger book.) Once we have actual physical copies, I can and will travel from city to city promoting Evil Monkey Man.
We can't do all this without you. Your contributions literally make this happen.


What We Need & What You Get.
We're looking to raise at least $500.00 in order to print enough copies of issues 2-4 as well as the trade. Any additional monies will simply mean more copies for more promotion. With all of this, eventually Evil Monkey Man will become a household name - and it all started and starts right here - with  you.
This time around we have a couple of really exciting, exclusive perks to share, including a signed print to accompany the trade paperback. Series artist Butch Mapa literally traveled all the way from the Philippines just to sign these prints! (Actually, he was in town to visit family and attend a wedding, but for the purposes of this campaign, we'll go with he came here to sign these prints story. And, by the way, these are Butch's first-ever signed prints!) We'll also be offering an exclusive poster, as well as original art by myself, and Russ Braun (who has drawn for Disney, DC & Marvel in addition to, and perhaps most famously for, the new Amazon TV series ""The Boys."") And for those hardcore fans among you - you can actually get drawn into one or more upcoming episodes!


The Impact.
""The Saga of Evil Monkey Man""  is a really cool, all-ages comic book (if I don't say so myself) based on the FL!NG Lo!S tune by Frank. It's got all the elements of those classic adventures that we either grew up with or are now enjoying on the big screen and TV. Lovable, relatable characters on a quest, helping our main protagonist Mike find his way back to being human. It's a time-traveling reality-bending romp, criss-crossing North America with innumerable easter-eggs and some esoteric surprises. And you need a few copies. I'm sure of it.
This will be our second (and hopefully second successful) campaign for Evil Monkey Man along with successful campaigns for Witch Hunter and The Last. Under the Monarch Comics imprint we've been selling out at conventions and later this year we will be distributed to BAM! (Books-A-Million.) But again, it all starts here, with your contribution. These campaigns not only give us the seed money to get going - they get you copies from early short print runs, exclusive collectibles, and of course, future bragging rights.
Incentive Perk!
When we hit the $500.00 funding goal - every backer will be offered a custom recording of Evil Monkey Man to be used as your outgoing voicemail - this means Mike (the Evil Monkey Man, as performed by Chuck Carbonaro) will actually answer your phone for you, and invite callers to leave a message!

Once this campaign is funded, print sourcing, printing and shipping is all we need to do, and we're doing that on a pretty regular basis at this point. So barring unforeseen tragedy, if we raise the funds we'll print the books. :)

Gurukitty Studios also had a similar issue, having lots of projects on the go, but producing nothing in the meantime, we wanted some nice looking books and we wanted to help out the other creators who were also looking for an outlet.The answer was anthology projects and how they work is, anyone can contributes a completed story, we jury them and  select some awesome ones. We then collect them in a book where the Gurukitty duo also add a story each to keep our skills sharp!Finally, we hold a cover contest to have another (or one of the contributors) artist (perhaps an aspiring cover illustrator) have an opportunity to get their work out there.Artists are compensated with comp copies of the book as well as the ability to buy additional copies at wholesale to sell at their convention tables for profit.It costs us a lot of money to produce these anthologies, and we are not well off by any means, we are hard working, self published comic artists just doing our best to get out there like everyone else and we work full time jobs on the side as well.  We need funds to buy the compensation copies for artists, mail them out to artists all over the world, additional copies for promotional giveaways, as well as stock to sell at local conventions. We also have to do a lot of marketing and promotional things to help get the book noticed which also costs money. The anthologies are also a lot of work to put together, coordinating all the files and people, editing the files to fit to the specifications (we’re talking 100’s of files), making the covers, adding tables of contents, credits and additional pages, registering ISBN and getting barcodes…the list goes on.The end goal is that the contributors (including us!) now have some published work to use for portfolios, promotion and to sell for profit.Cover Illustration by Jason Hart.Our newest anthology, Gateways to Beyond, is what we are currently raising money for to publish, is Science Fiction themed.This book contains 23 Black and white stories by artists all over the world, during the course of this campaign we will be showing samples from each story to show the variety of art styles and stories that will be contained within.

</h3>
<p>My name is Jordyn F. Bochon. I'm an artist and filmmaker currently residing in Halifax, Nova Scotia. A long time in the making, The Terrible Death of Finnegan Strappe is the macabre story of one man's self destructive, occult journey to utter ruin told through a veil of humor, gore, and glamour. This project is a labor of love, spanning several years. With this fundraiser I hope to self-publish the first three issues and get my work out to a larger audience. I've been publishing my own comics for years because I am passionate about what I do and can't imagine doing it any other way. </p>

<h3>Why Indie Gogo?</h3>
<p>It's quite a feat to create comics, and it's another one altogether to fund them. The reality is, I'm not able to bring together the funds I need to do this on my own. I'm hopeful that there are enough people out there who have been enjoying my work for free over the past several years who may also be interested in investing in it's evolution. By investing in this project, you become an important part of it.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The goal is to raise $2500, which would prominently go towards printing three 8.5x11"" issues. This is a large format comic, very satisfying to read, and full of work unavailable anywhere else. In addition to this, I'm trying to get my comics to wider audience by bringing them to events in the US (first time ever). Conventions in the future include SPX in Bethesda, MD and MIX in Minneapolis, MN. This fundraiser will help make this happen!</p>

<p>Everyone who contributes will be included in the credits and thank yous of each issue. The more you donate to the cause the more you receive in turn! Not only will you be able to look forward to receiving three separate stories in the mail, but you will also be rewarded with a variety of treasures befitting the contribution.  There are limited edition screen-prints, Terrible Death tote bags, original art, and even a personalized adventure comic starring you and any of my characters of your choosing!!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Michael Oden, and I want to thank you for your interest in <i>Elysian Fields</i>. Right off the bat, I want to establish what it is we are hoping to create here. This Zero Issue will serve as an <b>EXCLUSIVE COLLECTOR'S ITEM</b> for its supporters, as this project is being used to move the overall series forward. This edition of this book that will be released for this campaign will have a very nice, <strong>CARD STOCK COVER WITH FOIL STAMP, AND WILL INCLUDE 30+ PAGES OF STORY AND ARTWORK</strong>. This project is something that's been going around my head since High School, and it's something very special to me. Born out of a love for mythology, the idea of a deathmatch style tournament between legendary heroes of old was always something that I wanted, no, needed to bring to life. </p>
<p>After years of this idea circling around I finally made a script for a first issue, and I found a fantastic artist in Marcelo Oliveira Costa (portfolio included at the bottom of the summary) who is really kicking ass in bringing this vision to life, and with the Main Line in the state that it's in and the ongoing quarantine from Covid 19, I figured it would be best if we went the crowdfunding route. Anyways, without further ado, I present <i>Elysian Fields:</i></p>
<p><i>Achilles fought with a fiery rage for glory during his short life when he arrived in the underworld and reunited with his beloved comrade Patroclus, he thought he could finally spend eternity enjoying the things he missed out on in life. This was not the case, after a momentary reunion the Best of the Greeks was ferried away to an amphitheater where he was to fight alongside other heroes of his world: Herakles and Theseus, for the God Hades to regain his dominion over the underworld. With the world’s pantheons expanding, and past pantheons crumbling, Hades is willing to grant Achilles his greatest desire.</i></p>
<p><br/><i>Marcelo’s Portfolio: <a href=""https://marcoliverpenciler.wixsite.com/portifolio"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://marcoliverpenciler.wixsite.com/portifolio</a></i></p>

</div><div>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>The goal here is to publish this Zero issue to do a few things: 1. gauge public interest, 2. deliver a quality product for our consumer, 3. Raise enough to not only fund this book but to put money aside to invest in the future of this series and our new Independent Brand: 9 Realms Publishing. I have Reset the flex goal to 7,000 to make sure we hit it, but I do think we can still hit that 10,000 and as a result provide a majority of the funds for the next book as well!</li>
<li>There will be 4 perk tiers to start off: 1. Single issue: $10, 2. Double Trouble: $20, 3. Single Issue Deluxe: $15, 4. Double Trouble Deluxe: $25. Deluxe editions will include signatures from me! However, as publicity grows, and we gain traction, more tiers may become available.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact of this campaign is simple. It has become very difficult for people with both passion and talent to get involved in this industry. I remember growing up where both companies were readily accessible for fans to pitch ideas and concepts in monthly writing contests, and submissions. However, with COVID 19 crippling the mainline after years of lackluster sales, the time for independent, crowdfunding creators is now. We can revolutionize this market together, and with the success of this book will come the rise of my own publishing company: <i>9 Realms Publishing</i>. While it is a very pretentious and overused quote, Gandhi once said: ""Be the Change you want to see in the world."" This is the change I want for the industry, quality content written by people who care, so I am going to be it. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Obviously, the biggest risk and challenge here is failure. This is our first time trying to make a comic, with that, comes the hurdle of anonymity. I don't have a name, my artist has a portfolio and some fantastic art, but is not an industry legend that has made waves. So how are we going to combat this, the answer is aggressive marketing and, well, you.</p>
<ul>
<li>With connections, I have made through networking online for the past 4 years and as an Industry News writer, I have several connections on multiple social media platforms for nerd pages. </li>
<li>The plan will be to reach out to my various contacts, comic stores, and hell even people I haven't talked to that have massive youtube and social media followings, and promote this campaign as much as possible! And then there is what I am relying on you for because it's so much more than just money. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>While contributing is awesome and I super appreciate it if you do, but there is a much bigger way you can help. A way that goes so far beyond the monetary support. Share this campaign around, the more the merrier and the faster we can get this book to you the consumer. With this campaign's success will come more of these stories, and we want more than anything for you to experience them! So please if you could:</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
My name is Michael Oden, and I want to thank you for your interest in Elysian Fields. Right off the bat, I want to establish what it is we are hoping to create here. This Zero Issue will serve as an EXCLUSIVE COLLECTOR'S ITEM for its supporters, as this project is being used to move the overall series forward. This edition of this book that will be released for this campaign will have a very nice, CARD STOCK COVER WITH FOIL STAMP, AND WILL INCLUDE 30+ PAGES OF STORY AND ARTWORK. This project is something that's been going around my head since High School, and it's something very special to me. Born out of a love for mythology, the idea of a deathmatch style tournament between legendary heroes of old was always something that I wanted, no, needed to bring to life. 
After years of this idea circling around I finally made a script for a first issue, and I found a fantastic artist in Marcelo Oliveira Costa (portfolio included at the bottom of the summary) who is really kicking ass in bringing this vision to life, and with the Main Line in the state that it's in and the ongoing quarantine from Covid 19, I figured it would be best if we went the crowdfunding route. Anyways, without further ado, I present Elysian Fields:
Achilles fought with a fiery rage for glory during his short life when he arrived in the underworld and reunited with his beloved comrade Patroclus, he thought he could finally spend eternity enjoying the things he missed out on in life. This was not the case, after a momentary reunion the Best of the Greeks was ferried away to an amphitheater where he was to fight alongside other heroes of his world: Herakles and Theseus, for the God Hades to regain his dominion over the underworld. With the world’s pantheons expanding, and past pantheons crumbling, Hades is willing to grant Achilles his greatest desire.

<p>For both me and Agata, this comic represents a new chapter in our artistic careers. Telling a visual story is natural for me, but this format was fascinating and challenging to write for! Similarly, this is the longest visual story that Agata has told. It's stretching both of our artistic abilities. </p>
<p>At a practical level, neither of us has run a crowd funding campaign before, and neither of us have had a book or magazine professionally printed. Similarly, we've not had to deal with large amounts of international postage. </p>
<p>However! We've considered all the things we don't know, and done the relevant planning and research for how to deal with these issues. We're sure that we can push through and deliver a high quality piece of work. I've managed to get countless short films off the ground before, and I know that Agata has done some amazing illustration work. Between us, I'm sure we can make something fantastic! </p>

</div></div>","My name is Matthew Gilpin. I'm a writer and filmmaker with a handful of award winning short films under my belt, both as writer, and as director. You can see some of my previous work here!
I've always loved comics and graphic novels, from Marvel and DC to more independent books. I'm incredibly excited to finally be getting the chance to create a comic book, in collaboration with the amazing artist Agata Babinska. 
Secrets and Shadows is an ambitious Urban Fantasy series, inspired by Film Noir. I hope you enjoy it! 
Below you can see some of the concept art drawn by Agata, and a couple of pages of rough layouts. All character concepts include alternate versions that may not feature in the final book.









 

This project is fairly far along it's development process, but could not exist without your help. We will need:

Roughly £200 for printing costs.

<p>How does this stretch goal work? Simple!  If we make up the cost of putting together a new Middle book as described below through sales of ""The Pan-Universal Parental Reconciliation"" then we will create an an entirely new Middleman adventure for 2015 - another 88-100 page graphic novel that will continue the Middleman saga and go on sale as a print on demand title on the Middleman web store!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Sadly, we cannot offer the 2015 book as a solo premium or as an add on to new or existing donations -- merely that we will produce it if we meet our goal and offer it on our forthcoming webstore at a fair and delightful price!</p>

<p>Basically the funding for this project will go to helping me live the dream and for a few amazing months be able to work solely on my comics. The money will be going to art supplies, and other production costs required to work on it full time. I have some funds saved but not enough to make it long on my own.</p>
<p>I have been making comics for a few years now on my own while working fulltime and going to school full time. Each issue takes a lot of time to make for just a few minutes of reading and appreciation. Recently I have been published by Forbidden Panel, a comics publisher based in Redlands, CA. for my work on “The Plagued”. I am currently about 1800 dollars in the negative towards comics just in the last year. This year I am hoping I can at least break even, and that is where I need your help! I need this money so I can live my dream and tell this amazing story the way it’s meant to be told. </p>
<p>The story starts with a short 10 page Prologue. This prologue gives a short look at the rich back story that is the base for The Endangered (the thumbnails for the prologue are featured in the video above). After the Prologue comes Chapter 1. This official start of the story which begins with a man awaking from a hibernation pod alone in a pitch black room. He doesn't know where he is or what is happening. There is no one there to help him and this is where the fight to survive begins.</p>
<p>With the funding raised for this project in a month I will be able to have the pencils for the first issue complete. This means the collection of the Prologue and Chapter One will be done. But that wont be the only thing that gets completed. This fundraising project was created to give me multiple months away from work with my sole focus being this project. This means that by the end of the 3 month period this funding would allow me to have Issue #1 finished, and the pencils for Issue #2 finished.  </p>
<p>I have the whole story planned in concept, and the first two issues written and ready to go. With your help I could create this amazing thing, but without your help it may take me years just to get started. The story as it is so far is just about 25 issues long, but is really meant to be ongoing. I hope that you can help me to create my best work so far, because without my help it may take another 6 months before I can finish the first issue. </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>WHAT YOU GET IN RETURN!</strong></p>
<p>Everything in the world worth doing takes hard work and substantial amounts of time. In reality all I am asking for is the time. I will put in all the work if I can get the time I need to make this project succeed. I’m asking you to donate to my goal of 2500 dollars, but I want everyone to know before they give money that this money isn’t just for my personal spending. Printing costs a lot of money, but so do things like merchandise and advertisement. I’ve worked out all the costs for shipping incentives and everything else that needs to be done.</p>
<p>I have lots of incentives for the people who donate and I am really excited about them. They range from a PDF version of the Plagued, to a special first edition issue of The Endangered, all the way up to family Zombie Portraits and Original Pages from the first issue.</p>
<p>I want to point out that no matter how much money I am able to make I am still going to do everything I can to put this comic out into the world. Without reaching my goal I just am not able to guarantee the time it will take to make it happen.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>STRETCH GOALS</strong></p>
<p>I have some great stretch goals planned for the project. Here they are, all the way up to 4000 dollars which if I were to reach, there really isn’t any telling what I could accomplish.</p>
<ul>
<li>$2,800 – Special Edition alternative cover for all issues printed of The Endangered Issue #1. This cover will only be available for this printing of the first issue.</li>
<li>$3,200 – At this amount I can have funds enough to confidently put up preorders for issue #2 of The Endangered as a incentive prize separate from the others.</li>
<li>$3,500 – Everyone who has donated 20 dollars or more will receive Issue #2 of The Endangered as soon as it is released.</li>
<li>$4,000 – I will be able to work on The Endangered for the foreseeable future. This is truly my goal, but I feel like asking for this amount would be unreasonable. With this amount I would be able to finish the first issue, the second issue, and possibly have the pencils done for the third or even more. Also at this amount everyone who has donated $12 or more will receive a Special Edition Issue of The Plagued that will only be available through this project and in the first trade of The Plagued. The issue will also include special pages of Zombie Sketches and images of some of the portraits created for people during this issue.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p><strong>OTHER WAYS TO HELP</strong></p>
<p>If you are unable to donate or contribute to the project financially I understand. I am very poor and can totally relate, but please share this page on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, or your website if you have one. Any way that you can spread the word to help me get more pledges would be not only absolutely fantastic, but also deeply appreciated.</p></div>","WHAT YOU'RE FUNDING

I have lots of incentives for the people who donate and I am really excited about them. They range from a PDF version of the Plagued, to a special first edition issue of The Endangered, all the way up to family Zombie Portraits and Original Pages from the first issue.
I want to point out that no matter how much money I am able to make I am still going to do everything I can to put this comic out into the world. Without reaching my goal I just am not able to guarantee the time it will take to make it happen.
 
STRETCH GOALS
I have some great stretch goals planned for the project. Here they are, all the way up to 4000 dollars which if I were to reach, there really isn’t any telling what I could accomplish.

$2,800 – Special Edition alternative cover for all issues printed of The Endangered Issue #1. This cover will only be available for this printing of the first issue.
$3,200 – At this amount I can have funds enough to confidently put up preorders for issue #2 of The Endangered as a incentive prize separate from the others.
$3,500 – Everyone who has donated 20 dollars or more will receive Issue #2 of The Endangered as soon as it is released.
$4,000 – I will be able to work on The Endangered for the foreseeable future. This is truly my goal, but I feel like asking for this amount would be unreasonable. With this amount I would be able to finish the first issue, the second issue, and possibly have the pencils done for the third or even more. Also at this amount everyone who has donated $12 or more will receive a Special Edition Issue of The Plagued that will only be available through this project and in the first trade of The Plagued. The issue will also include special pages of Zombie Sketches and images of some of the portraits created for people during this issue.
 
OTHER WAYS TO HELP
If you are unable to donate or contribute to the project financially I understand. I am very poor and can totally relate, but please share this page on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, or your website if you have one. Any way that you can spread the word to help me get more pledges would be not only absolutely fantastic, but also deeply appreciated.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Canadian Comedy Award Winner Sandra Battaglini in...</h3>
<h3>CLASSY LADY</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Sandra Battaglini. I'm a Toronto-based artist and am mounting a new solo show, CLASSY LADY, premiering this June at Toronto's Alumnae Theatre.  This is my sixth and most exciting solo presentation. My last solo show, <em>Hard Headed Woman</em>, played to sold out audiences and won a Canadian Comedy Award. </p>
<p>All of my projects are fuelled primarily by passion. Up until now I've funded my own shows and it's my dream to be able to share this project and future projects with people who are supporters of the arts, theatre, and comedy.</p>
<p>My goal with this campaign is to raise <strong>$10,000</strong>. These funds will be used toward the compensation of the theatre rental, promotion (printing &amp; publicity), support staff (director, stage manager, technical director, etc), and costumes. And if my entire goal is not met, whatever is raised will be distributed as an honorarium to those individuals who worked so hard behind the scenes to make my vision a reality.</p>
<p>CLASSY LADY is my most imaginative adventure yet, and I'm so excited to bring this to life with the help of your donations. And I always love to meet and communicate with my supporters and fans - so each of the donations will be met with some perks that will allow you to enjoy the work that came out of your generosity!</p>
<p>Your generosity will be met with one or more of the following perks:</p>
<p>* tickets to CLASSY LADY</p>
<p>* A signed official CLASSY LADY poster</p>
<p>* Special mention in the CLASSY LADY program</p>
<p>* CLASSY LADY swag (t-shirt, book bag, mug)</p>
<p>* Double Date: dinner and CLASSY LADY tickets for 4</p>
<p>* Dinner for you and a guest with the star &amp; the director of CLASSY LADY, Sandra Battaglini &amp; Phil Luzi</p>
<p>* A CLASSY LADY Producer credit</p>
<p>* An event hosted by Sandra Battaglni &amp; Phil Luzi as <em>Sandy Frigginelli &amp; Sal Feldman</em>, stars of the smash hit variety cabaret <em>""The Sal &amp; Sandy Show""</em></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contributions will help to realize an artist's vision of creating a space of joy and laughter. I love making people laugh, it's the most rewarding element of my work. My vision for CLASSY LADY is to have a successful sold-out run, and to then take the show on the road; Across Canada, the United States, and even Europe!</p>
<p>Based on my last solo show, Canadian Comedy Award Winning <em>Hard Headed Woman, </em>I know that this goal is within reach.  And I would like to package a show that is ready to take on tour. CLASSY LADY is that show!</p>

costs of these cons – fast food, fast women LOL you know what I mean. Cons are
the best way to promote my work as an artist and now that I’ve got access to
the materials, they’re the next thing I need access to. Which brings us to:</p>
<p>Going
back to that Portland con I'm eye-balling for January: it’s part of the <b>WizardWorld </b>family
of conventions, and they do this pretty great thing where the more cons you
pre-register for, the bigger a discount you get. I’ve checked off 7 (including
Portland) regional cons that I think will be heavily attended by my potential

<p>It
boggles the mind to think of getting enough money to cover all of these things,
so let's go back to the basics in case you haven't been to this page before,
and you're all, <b>""What is he even talking about? WHAT THE HELL IS <i>EBFT</i>?""</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>THE BOOK</b></p>
<p><i><b>Elegant Battle Face
Teenagers</b></i> is <i>EBFT.</i>  is a story about good and evil; love and hate; potential and failure; 1997
and 2197. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/867599/files/20140918221413-EBFT_PP_001.jpg?1411103653"" src="""" style=""width: 427.333333333333px; height: 641px;""/></p><p>In 1997, a madman
called <b>Adam has left a bloody trail of destruction across the globe</b> on
a hunt for a boy named Hype who has the power to defeat him. With the help of
Ashlynn and the rest of his friends, <b>Hype is able to hide away across
space and time in 2197</b> and plan his revenge on Adam. </p>
<p>Adam, too, gathers
followers and bides his time until he can vanquish the Hype. But as Hype delves
deeper into history – both his own and Adam’s – <b>he learns
that good and evil are never black and white</b>, and they’ve both made
decisions that altered many fates far beyond their imagining.</p>
<p>The images in this campaign
comprise some panels from the opening pages of <i>EBFTZERO </i>(prologue
to <i>Volume One</i>)- it's a time-hopping, globe-trotting
adventure that jumps from the ruin of Dallas to the backroads of central Texas
to the Tombs of the Apostles in Italy.</p>

<p>I know I can get my
product into local comic shops, and DFW, TX has more than a couple. However, <b>beyond
that, I don’t know.</b> I don’t think making funny books is going to get
me rich, and my personal available resources are already going into the
production of the <i>ZERO</i> issue, but <b>I do think this
project could be a MAJOR step in making it possible for me to make THE NEXT
THING</b>, and your contribution is the first step in that being true.</p>
<p>I dream of writing <i>X-Men</i>, <i>Green Lantern</i>, and <i>Buffy
the Vampire Slayer</i> comics.<b>The only way that dream can come true is
to make my own comics</b> – to prove to The Powers That Be, that I can do
something amazing with a property that I myself invented, completed, AND sold.</p>
<p>When I complete <i>EBFT VOLUME ONE</i>, I will have put
together a big enough, bad enough (the good kind of bad, duh) body of work that <b>I
could potentially team with publishers like IMAGE or DARK HORSE to reissue it
in a major pro-printed and designed edition, and go forward with <i>EBFTVOL2</i>.</b> <i>That's
right, I have plans for at least 6 volumes down the line.</i></p><p><i><br/></i></p>

<p>Some
people just can't contribute financially, and I more than understand that, but
that also doesn't mean that you can't help in some way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please, help me get the word
     out and make some noise about my campaign.<b>Especially pass this campaign
     along if you know any LGBT comic fans or comic fans who are People of
     Color</b>, because even as a gay white guy, I have a strong interest in
     making sure my book is representative of my readership - and I hope to
     reach all races, sexualities, gender identities, and political
     affiliations. (Those queer trans black Republicans are going <i>love</i> my
     comic book,  y'all, no kidding!)</li>
<li>
<b>They tell me that IndieGoGo has
     some awesome on-board share tools, so don't be afraid to use those!</b> LOL.</li>

so let's go back to the basics in case you haven't been to this page before,
and you're all, ""What is he even talking about? WHAT THE HELL IS EBFT?""

THE BOOK
Elegant Battle Face
Teenagers is EBFT.  is a story about good and evil; love and hate; potential and failure; 1997
and 2197. In 1997, a madman
called Adam has left a bloody trail of destruction across the globe on
a hunt for a boy named Hype who has the power to defeat him. With the help of
Ashlynn and the rest of his friends, Hype is able to hide away across
space and time in 2197 and plan his revenge on Adam. 
Adam, too, gathers
followers and bides his time until he can vanquish the Hype. But as Hype delves
deeper into history – both his own and Adam’s – he learns
that good and evil are never black and white, and they’ve both made
decisions that altered many fates far beyond their imagining.
The images in this campaign
comprise some panels from the opening pages of EBFTZERO (prologue
to Volume One)- it's a time-hopping, globe-trotting
adventure that jumps from the ruin of Dallas to the backroads of central Texas
to the Tombs of the Apostles in Italy.
""A rockin' indie
comic flavored like Claremont's X-Men, BKV's Saga,
and Buffy the Vampire Slayer.""My name is James Bevard Hargrave, and I'm the creator, writer,
and illustrator of Elegant Battle Face Teenagers. I just finished my
MFA in Creative Writing at The New School University in New York, NY and moved
back to Texas. My master’s thesis consisted of the Prologue to Volume
One – and it’s an instant perk as a .PDF for every donation over
$5.00.
I’ve been cooking up EBFT in one form or
another (for years I thought it would be a YA novel) since
2009 when I was Assistant Maneater (typo and it stays, but MANAGER is what I
meant) at the world famous Lone Star Comics Dallas (R.I.P., long live URBAN
LEGENDS COMICS in Mesquite, TX). Now that I know it is a graphic
narrative, being able to properly illustrate, edit, manipulate, and publish it
in a timely fashion means the world to me – I’m doing everything
myself, which is why I need help assembling my supplies in a timely fashion.Risks & Challenges
I know I can get my
product into local comic shops, and DFW, TX has more than a couple. However, beyond
that, I don’t know. I don’t think making funny books is going to get
me rich, and my personal available resources are already going into the
production of the ZERO issue, but I do think this
project could be a MAJOR step in making it possible for me to make THE NEXT
THING, and your contribution is the first step in that being true.
I dream of writing X-Men, Green Lantern, and Buffy
the Vampire Slayer comics.The only way that dream can come true is
to make my own comics – to prove to The Powers That Be, that I can do
something amazing with a property that I myself invented, completed, AND sold.
When I complete EBFT VOLUME ONE, I will have put
together a big enough, bad enough (the good kind of bad, duh) body of work that I
could potentially team with publishers like IMAGE or DARK HORSE to reissue it
in a major pro-printed and designed edition, and go forward with EBFTVOL2. That's
right, I have plans for at least 6 volumes down the line.

Other Ways You Can Help
Some
people just can't contribute financially, and I more than understand that, but
that also doesn't mean that you can't help in some way:

Please, help me get the word
     out and make some noise about my campaign.Especially pass this campaign
     along if you know any LGBT comic fans or comic fans who are People of
     Color, because even as a gay white guy, I have a strong interest in
     making sure my book is representative of my readership - and I hope to
     reach all races, sexualities, gender identities, and political
     affiliations. (Those queer trans black Republicans are going love my
     comic book,  y'all, no kidding!)

They tell me that IndieGoGo has
     some awesome on-board share tools, so don't be afraid to use those! LOL.
Check out our shops at http://cafepress.com/elegantbattlefaceteenagers    and http://www.cafepress.com/xicomix    for cool swag you can carry around with to
     promote EBFTZERO and our new comic studio XI COMIX. We receive
     a 5% royalty from sales, but it's a better deal than printing our own
     merch - for now.

<p><b>WELCOME TO THE CORPORATION...<i>Where a life can be terminated for the right price...and no one will be the wiser.</i></b></p>
<p><i>Malice is forever cloaked in mystery.  It lurks in an invisible universe filled with strangers – both interconnected and disconnected.  His was a world, in which life was expendable and identities could be bought.  Sex was common ground and murder was always a way out. Secrets and lies were celebrated until one got caught. In his world she could be anyone she wanted while completely losing sight of who she was.  Welcome to The Corporation – an organization unlike any you’ve ever worked in before.</i></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">My name is Angela Fielder, and I am the creator/author of The Corporation project. I started my writing career, just about 15 years ago.  I worked as an Arts &amp; Lifestyle journalist, mainly covering movie junkets and premieres as well as celebrity profiles for various publications (Rolling Out Urbanstyle, The Robertson Treatment, Vodka Magazine and a host of others.) From there, I went on to write spy novellas. Two of the characters made their debut to the world in a few of those novellas.  </span></p>
<p>This campaign is super important to me for a number of reasons.  First and foremost, both stories have been stuck in my head for years and without funding it is tough to get the illustrations done right. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">There are two stories in one! Which means that we're making 2 comic books - 1 gives you the backstory on the dangerous Dawud El-Hashem, #7 on the U.S. terrorists list, and the 2nd tells the story of the lead assassin in El-Hashem's Corporation , Khadijah Khan. This is only the beginning of an amazing series on the deadly assassins that El-Hashem manages to have do his dirty work. But the story is sort of being told backwards (from the end to the beginning) instead of vice versa. </span><br/><br/></p>
<p> ""The Corporation"" answers the question - what happens when a gorgeous, one-eyed, middle eastern assassin turns on her mentor? Will she kill him or will he kill her? He trained her, and taught her all that she knows - but in ""The Corporation-Wrath of Khan"", Khadijah Khan questions her loyalty to her mentor, #7 (aka, billionaire tycoon and former-asset-turned-terrorist, Dawud El-Hashem).  In the second story, </p>

<div>Meet Khadijah Khan - one of the more psychotic women in El-Hashem's lot of assassins. In this story, Khadijah is fed up with El-Hashem. He stole her beauty (took out her right eye), forced her to kill people, and turned her into a monster. That was not the initial plan that she had for her life. While en route to a hit, she contemplates killing El-Hashem instead. That's where the story kicks into overdrive. El-Hashem is already on the run from the CIA and MI-5, but his billion dollar lifestyle enables him to hide comfortably in plain sight.

Fielder. All rights reserved.</div>
<div>
<br/>Meet Dawud El-Hashem, a billionaire businessman, former asset to the United States, and now #7 on the Persons of Interest list in both the nation that leads the free world and the United Kingdom. To date, he has killed two federal agents and used his connections in various puppet regimes to kidnap and incarcerate another federal agent. The game just got real for him because the United States has sent yet another rookie in the field to track him and bring him to justice...alive. They'll never catch him, or so he thinks. <br/><br/>The product of a rape during India's post partition years, El-Hashem had a life riddled with strife until a chance meeting with an Arab businessman changed his life forever. It was through working with the businessman that El-Hashem gained power, insight and wealth in the Arab world which led to him being a most coveted asset for the United States. When the special ops team doesn't uphold their end of the bargain, he turns rogue which is where this book begins. He's on the run - with properties all over the world, it isn't hard to hide, but with an ambitious and vivacious federal agent on his heels, trouble is sure to brew in the undertow.<p></p>
</div>
<br/><p>In ""The Name is El-Hashem: A Calculated Risk"", the reader gains better insight as to why Dawud El-Hashem is the sociopath that he is.  His past haunts him daily and definitely regulates the on-goings of his future.  He is a child of partition, left to fend for himself when he fled to the U.K. with his family.  He is orphaned by the time he's a teenager and all of these things play a role on the type of man that he currently is now.  In this particular story, we meet an ambitious U.S. federal agent, whose quest to avenge the lives of her colleagues leads her into the deadly auspices of Dawud El-Hashem.  What happens when he gets caught adds to the web of deceit in which his life and work has been carefully crafted from.  </p> </div> <div> <h3>

WELCOME TO THE CORPORATION...Where a life can be terminated for the right price...and no one will be the wiser.
Malice is forever cloaked in mystery.  It lurks in an invisible universe filled with strangers – both interconnected and disconnected.  His was a world, in which life was expendable and identities could be bought.  Sex was common ground and murder was always a way out. Secrets and lies were celebrated until one got caught.

This campaign is super important to me for a number of reasons.  First and foremost, both stories have been stuck in my head for years and without funding it is tough to get the illustrations done right. There are two stories in one! Which means that we're making 2 comic books - 1 gives you the backstory on the dangerous Dawud El-Hashem, #7 on the U.S. terrorists list, and the 2nd tells the story of the lead assassin in El-Hashem's Corporation , Khadijah Khan.

  The Impact A percentage of the proceeds will also go as a contribution to autism research at the Kennedy Krieger Institute.  Someone super special and extremely close to my heart has an autism spectrum disorder.  He and I have walked the walk along the autism spectrum together, and a portion of your donation will go to Kennedy Krieger Institute.  You can't imagine how much the folks there have helped that special someone in my life.  Here's a way where everyone can win!Risks & Challenges  
The main risk is financial.  I need funding in order to cover mass production costs.  Setbacks should not occur, but if they do I know how to finagle around them. I do not forsee any other production setbacks.  Here is a breakdown of where your contributions will go.
-To pay for the creative costs associated with writing, drawing, and coloring the book. 
-To pay for the production, high quality printing and shipping of this first run of at least 1,000 comics. I intend to use high quality paper for printing, which has an overall better quality.
-To pay for the creative costs, production costs and shipping of the reward items.

<td style=""vertical-align: top;"">Hi. I’m Terry Martin,
head honcho of the publishers The House of Murky Depths, responsible for the
award-winning* anthology magazine <i>Murky Depths</i> that mixed short stories with
comics. I won’t bore you with other interesting facts about me, this is about
<i>Dead Girls - The Graphic Novel. </i> While I'm part of the team that's making it possible, it's writer Richard Calder and artist Leonardo M Giron that deserve the accolade.</td>
</tr></tbody></table><p></p>
<p></p><table style=""border: 0px; padding: 0px;""><tbody><tr>
<td style=""vertical-align: top;"">
<i>Dead Girls - The Graphic Novel</i> is Richard Calder's adaptation - and radical re-imagining - of his 1992 cyberpunk novel <i>Dead Girls</i>, written while he was living in Nongkhai, Thailand, a small border town on the Mekong River, overlooking Laos. Other novels include <i>Dead Boys, Dead Things</i> (which, of course, completed the acclaimed 'Dead' trilogy), <i>Cythera, Frenzetta, The Twist, Malignos, Impakto, Lord Soho,</i> and <i>Babylon</i>. Following a decade-long sojourn in Thailand and the Philippines, he returned to the UK and currently lives in London.<br/><p></p>

<td> </td>
<td style=""vertical-align: top;"">Filipino artist Leonardo M Giron lives in Manila. His work - an eclectic, turbocharged mix of Eastern and Western influences - is inspired by Japanese mangakas, such as Shirow Masamune, and DC luminaries, such as Mike Mignola and Eduardo Risso. Richard Calder says: 'Leonardo M Giron's indigenous grasp of the ambience that Manila shares with Bangkok, and his ability to translate this into a unique, manga-like idiom - a kind of ""manga+"" - makes him perfect for delineating the cyberpunk exuberance and sheer down-and-dirty exoticism of Dead Girls.'</td>
</tr></tbody></table><p></p><p>
</p><p>Back in 2008 Richard Calder said he’d like to turn the film
script of his cult cyberpunk novel <i>Dead Girls </i>into a graphic novel – and
we jumped at the chance! Leonardo M Giron, an artist from the Philippines, had
worked with us on a number of James Johnson’s comic shorts and when approached
was keen to collaborate on the project. His manga-inspired style gave Richard
Calder's characters, Primavera and Iggy, brilliant new life, and the story,
serialised, first in award-winning* anthology
magazine <i>Murky Depths</i>,
and then later in issues #1 - #8 of <i>Dead

'Here is a fusion of Japanese manga with American comics that is vivid, exciting and lovingly-detailed. Giron is one of the very best working in comics today.'  Lavie Tidhar
‘Dead Girls is a fiendish futuristic fairytale full of style and invention. A thrilling tale told at breakneck pace with beautiful manga-inspired artwork. Highly recommended.’  SFX



 
 
Hi. I’m Terry Martin,
head honcho of the publishers The House of Murky Depths, responsible for the
award-winning* anthology magazine Murky Depths that mixed short stories with
comics. I won’t bore you with other interesting facts about me, this is about
Dead Girls - The Graphic Novel.  While I'm part of the team that's making it possible, it's writer Richard Calder and artist Leonardo M Giron that deserve the accolade.



Dead Girls - The Graphic Novel is Richard Calder's adaptation - and radical re-imagining - of his 1992 cyberpunk novel Dead Girls, written while he was living in Nongkhai, Thailand, a small border town on the Mekong River, overlooking Laos. Other novels include Dead Boys, Dead Things (which, of course, completed the acclaimed 'Dead' trilogy), Cythera, Frenzetta, The Twist, Malignos, Impakto, Lord Soho, and Babylon. Following a decade-long sojourn in Thailand and the Philippines, he returned to the UK and currently lives in London.

 




 
Filipino artist Leonardo M Giron lives in Manila. His work - an eclectic, turbocharged mix of Eastern and Western influences - is inspired by Japanese mangakas, such as Shirow Masamune, and DC luminaries, such as Mike Mignola and Eduardo Risso. Richard Calder says: 'Leonardo M Giron's indigenous grasp of the ambience that Manila shares with Bangkok, and his ability to translate this into a unique, manga-like idiom - a kind of ""manga+"" - makes him perfect for delineating the cyberpunk exuberance and sheer down-and-dirty exoticism of Dead Girls.'

Back in 2008 Richard Calder said he’d like to turn the film
script of his cult cyberpunk novel Dead Girls into a graphic novel – and
we jumped at the chance! Leonardo M Giron, an artist from the Philippines, had
worked with us on a number of James Johnson’s comic shorts and when approached
was keen to collaborate on the project. His manga-inspired style gave Richard
Calder's characters, Primavera and Iggy, brilliant new life, and the story,
serialised, first in award-winning* anthology
magazine Murky Depths,
and then later in issues #1 - #8 of Dead
Girls the comic series, has drawn a following from around the world.


  

Murky Depths #9, published in the Autumn of 2009,
launched Dead Girls. It ran,
with a three-issue break, from issue #12 through #18 – the last issue of Murky
Depths to be published. But Dead Girls had momentum. Two guys
were set on creating something new and exciting while remaining faithful to the
spirit of the original novel. So, with additional pages and a full-colour
make-over (Murky Depths'  internals were printed in black
monotone) the eight-comic Dead Girls series of fourteen episodes came into being. Dead
Girls #8 - Just Like Heaven, the final comic in the series, running to thirty-two pages, was published
in May 2014.



The series was intended to keep the Dead Girls
franchise alive and in the minds of readers. It gave its creators something
tangible; a reward for their labours. Dead Girls -The Graphic Novel,
with additional pages to iron out those small continuity issues that Mike
Carey, for one, picked up on in the comic series, and with an introduction by
World Fantasy Award winning author Lavie Tidhar, and an afterword by Aurealis
Award winner KJ Bishop, is therefore ready to go to the printers. But this is
going to be the biggest single investment that The House of Murky Depths has
made and to that end we ask that you support Dead Girls - The Graphic Novel

I had big dreams for the Edinburgh Fringe this year. After the success of my 3rd solo show, the ""immigrational comedy"" Something To Declare, I have written a  topical political show, told from my personal prism. I called it Begging To Differ. It is my 4th solo show and I believe it is funny and poignant. But I can't take it to Edinburgh. A combination of financial disasters and wrong timing made it impossible for me to take it to the one festival where shows come to live or die.</p><p>I was devastated for a  while and then decided to go a different route, to tour Begging to Differ across the UK and in a few European destinations and bring it to Edinburgh for 2017 when it is all toured and honed. My aim is to play Begging To Differ 30 times before the end of August - this would put me at an equal footing with shows that go through a full run at the Edinburgh Fringe. </p><p>But touring costs money too. Travel, Posters designs, contacting venues and promoters across the country, advertising, accommodation, flyers, flyerers, PR. I am not spoiled, I'm not looking to do this in luxury, I aim to go to maximum of places, reach a maximum audience, say what I want to say, get the laughs, beg to differ, make a difference.</p><p>A small budget like the sum I'm bidding for can take a comedy show a long way, to cities and villages, local fringe festivals, rooms above pubs, community centres and suburban theatres, making people laugh; urging them to think. Your contribution will make me your laughter envoy, carrying my jokes-trolley across the UK, over to Ireland, France, Spain and Italy. My main hope is to cross the channel and perform it for the refugees and volunteers in Calais. </p><p>I will use the funds I raise to pay Festival Fees (Festivals and festival venues charge 10-100 pounds for one show), travel to shows, pay for AirBNB rooms in places where I can't sofa-surf, get flyers designed and printed.</p><p>Also, it is my birthday! I'm 46 on 14 April. Please don't buy me scented candles and body butter this year. I do love them, but this year I'm asking you to help me push my dream forward.</p><br/><h3>What I need</h3><p>To get this show on the road I need to book it into as many venues as possible. I already have 4 shows booked for the Brighton Fringe, 4 at the Camden Fringe, Two at the Hastings Fringe, Two at the Manchester Women In Comedy Festival, and I'm negotiating with other festivals and venues. </p><p>Not making the goal will not mean that all is lost. It only means that I could do less, Going over the goal would not mean I'll spend it on pizza and loose men - it means I'll be able to perform more shows. </p><h3>What You Get</h3><p>You get to contribute to a funny show written from the unique point of view of a comedian who had in her lifetime the fortune and the haplessness of being the boss and the subject, the coloniser and the immigrant, the chief and the traveller. I was a rebel and a soldier, a fat girl and a thin one, a human rights lawyer and a news editor, a journalist and an academic. I sat crying on the ""immigrants bench"" in Heathrow, I've scored drugs in an ambulance - I've seen a thing or two. </p><p>Also, you can claim a perk. I realised that I'm really terrible at organising a shipping service, and that postal prices in the UK could devastate a whole campaign if I start posting signed posters (or unsigned ones) around. The whole purpose of the campaign is that you can come watch it, so all perks involve free tickets for shows, and extra perks that are to be delivered during said shows. I think that's the most effective way to go about it. That said, if you can't make any show, and can't put in the kind of contribution that would make me come to you, let me know, and I'll post you a few signed flyers and posters. </p><p></p><h3>Challenges</h3><p>The main challenge is to get the show booked for as many venues as possible, and particularly to hit the target number of 30 shows before the end of August. But It is possible! Especially with your help, see the next section.</p><p> </p><h3>Other ways you can help</h3><p>You may well be just as skint as I am, but you still can help! You can share this Indiegogo campaign on Facebook, twitter and any other social media. Follow me on twitter @missdcomedy and encourage others to follow and contribute. </p><p>And if you are aware of a venue near by you that can host a comedy show, whether it is a regular ongoing comedy club or a theatre/pub that runs events, let me know and I'll get in touch!</p><p>If you are a part of a group of people (social club, workplace group, extended family, old people's home, trade union), who can arrange a group or anything over 20 people in a venue of your choice, you can organise a group donation and I will bring the show to you!</p><br/>I am most grateful for any help you could offer and looking forward to seeing you along the Begging To Differ journey. <div><p><br/></p></div></div>","Indigogo campaignBegging To Differ: Get It On The RoadMy name is Daphna Baram, I'm a London based stand up comedian.

My main hope is to cross the channel and perform it for the refugees and volunteers in Calais. I will use the funds I raise to pay Festival Fees (Festivals and festival venues charge 10-100 pounds for one show), travel to shows, pay for AirBNB rooms in places where I can't sofa-surf, get flyers designed and printed.Also, it is my birthday! I'm 46 on 14 April. Please don't buy me scented candles and body butter this year. I do love them, but this year I'm asking you to help me push my dream forward.What I needTo get this show on the road I need to book it into as many venues as possible. I already have 4 shows booked for the Brighton Fringe, 4 at the Camden Fringe, Two at the Hastings Fringe, Two at the Manchester Women In Comedy Festival, and I'm negotiating with other festivals and venues. Not making the goal will not mean that all is lost. It only means that I could do less, Going over the goal would not mean I'll spend it on pizza and loose men - it means I'll be able to perform more shows. What You GetYou get to contribute to a funny show written from the unique point of view of a comedian who had in her lifetime the fortune and the haplessness of being the boss and the subject, the coloniser and the immigrant, the chief and the traveller. I was a rebel and a soldier, a fat girl and a thin one, a human rights lawyer and a news editor, a journalist and an academic. I sat crying on the ""immigrants bench"" in Heathrow, I've scored drugs in an ambulance - I've seen a thing or two. Also, you can claim a perk. I realised that I'm really terrible at organising a shipping service, and that postal prices in the UK could devastate a whole campaign if I start posting signed posters (or unsigned ones) around. The whole purpose of the campaign is that you can come watch it, so all perks involve free tickets for shows, and extra perks that are to be delivered during said shows. I think that's the most effective way to go about it. That said, if you can't make any show, and can't put in the kind of contribution that would make me come to you, let me know, and I'll post you a few signed flyers and posters. ChallengesThe main challenge is to get the show booked for as many venues as possible, and particularly to hit the target number of 30 shows before the end of August. But It is possible! Especially with your help, see the next section. Other ways you can helpYou may well be just as skint as I am, but you still can help! You can share this Indiegogo campaign on Facebook, twitter and any other social media. Follow me on twitter @missdcomedy and encourage others to follow and contribute. And if you are aware of a venue near by you that can host a comedy show, whether it is a regular ongoing comedy club or a theatre/pub that runs events, let me know and I'll get in touch!If you are a part of a group of people (social club, workplace group, extended family, old people's home, trade union), who can arrange a group or anything over 20 people in a venue of your choice, you can organise a group donation and I will bring the show to you!I am most grateful for any help you could offer and looking forward to seeing you along the Begging To Differ journey.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns
