This is my story:<div>
<br/><p>I was born in 1994 in Dirhata, a small village in <b>Darfur</b>, in the western part of Sudan. In 2003, when the Janjaweed militias came to kill all the males, I was nine years old. My father and older brother were shot dead. I was saved only because my mother dressed me as a girl. The killers hit her and asked where her other sons were, but she said she only had daughters left: these were my sisters and I. The militias burned the house, waiting outside to make sure we were dead. My mother told us to cry and shout. The militias thus thought we were dying and left the place. We escaped the burning house and left the village. <b>On the way, we spotted my fatherʼs body, and few meters ahead my brother<b>ʼ</b>s.</b> We arrived to a UN refugees camp in Chad, in which we lived together until 2007. At that point I decided I could no longer live in the hard conditions of the camp. Rather than going back to our village and fight, <b>I wanted to study</b>. <br/></p>
<p><b>I realized we could gain back our homes by studying, by understanding the political situation and how it evolved, and by coming up with non-violent ways to make peace and end the genocide</b>. <br/></p>
<p>I left the UN camp when <b>I was only thirteen</b>, leaving behind my
beloved ones.</p>

<p></p>
<p>I crossed Chad and reached Libya. In the city of Bengazi I started learning English and I worked in a shop, earning some money for living. After a year and a half I moved with a friend to Egypt, where studying was cheap, according to what I had heard. But the Egyptian and Sudanese governments collaborated to send the Darfur people back, only <b>to face either limitless imprisonment or death</b>. I had to leave Egypt.<br/></p>
<p>One day, on the television, <b>I watched a
documentary about the Shoah</b>, the Jewish Holocaust. The only thing I knew about
the Jews was that Israel is the only Jewish country in the world. Watching the
documentary, I learned about the <b>Jewish people's past</b>, about their <b>being freed
from slavery in Egypt</b>, about the persecutions and discrimination they have suffered
over the centuries until they were able to found their own country and live
there freely. <b>I could identify myself with this story </b>and I had no doubt that
the Jewish people would sympathize with my and my people's story: <b>I had to go
to Israel</b>.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439123787/mwhbdvhi2tcqfdwbelod.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 546px; height: 546px;""/></p>
<p>I got in touch with someone who smuggled migrants
over the border to Israel. We were twelve people in the group, including me and
my friend. At night, we crawled towards the Israeli part, trying to avoid the
Egyptian soldiers. Then, suddenly, someone in the group got panicked: he jumped to his feet and started shouting. Three bullets in the head, shot by the
soldiers, killed him on the spot. The soldiers now came in our direction and<b> we
had no choice but to start running towards the Israeli border fence and hope
that the bullets would not hit us</b>. We dropped everything we had and<b> ran, ran
ran. My friend and I ran as fast as we could, holding hands.</b> On the way,
another man in the group was shot dead, followed by his fellow who came back to
assist him. The rest of us reached the border fence and climbed on it. The
Israeli soldiers gave us water and treated our wounds.</p>
<p>I was taken to a prison, where I spent a month and
a half in the adults section. When I was released, I got a temporary visa and moved
to Tel Aviv, where I lived without any clear purpose. But I kept learning
English. In 2010 <b>I moved to Yemin Orde, a youth village that provides migrants and refugees with
a place to live in</b> and with the possibility to study. <b>I felt safe for the first
time </b>since I had arrived to Israel. I learned Hebrew and did high school there.
In 2014, I finished my exams. Since then, <b>I have been volunteering </b>in the
village<b>, trying to give back at least some of what I have received there so
generously</b>.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Now <b>I would like to make the next step and acquire
higher education</b>. I have already been accepted to undergraduate studies in two
Israeli institutions, between which I have to choose: the prestigious Lauder

<p></p>
<p><b>Studying is the reason I why left the camp in
Chad. Despite all the difficulties I encountered ever since, I have never
forgotten this goal and dream</b>. </p>
<p>I learned hard to get good grades in high school,
and also the acceptance to the two institutions of higher education is the
fruit of hard work. I want to have a degree in political science and
international relations. I want to go back to my country and help my people
live in peace on their land. <b>I want to build a bridge between my first
homeland, Africa, and my second one, Israel </b>– the country of the people who I am still
convinced can best identify with my situation, since they had precisely the
same unfortunate experience.</p>

<p></p>
<p>While I am pursuing my goals, I am not forgetting
my brothers and sisters who have gone through the same hell like me. As I have
been doing so far, I will keep helping other refugees who live in Israel and
have difficulties, and visiting inmates in detention camps for refugees. I am
also not forgetting the youth village that has given me the possibility to live
well and study. I am continuing to volunteer in the various facilities of the
village. </p>

<p style=""text-align: right;"">
נולדתי בשנת
1994 בדירהטה,
כפר קטן במחוז
<b>דארפור</b> שבמערב סודאן. ב-2003,
כאשר מיליציות
הג'נג'אווידים
באו להרוג את כל הגברים והילדים הזכרים,
הייתי בן
תשע. אבי
ואחי הגדול נורו למוות. אני
ניצלתי רק בזכות אמי שהלבישה אותי כמו
ילדה. הרוצחים
הכו אותה ושאלו אותה איפה הבנים האחרים
שלה, אבל
היא אמרה שנותרו לה רק בנות: אלו
היו אחיותיי ואני. אנשי
המיליציה הציתו את הבית באש, וחיכו
בחוץ כדי לוודא שנשרפנו. אמי
אמרה לנו לצעוק חזק ולבכות, ככה
אנשי המיליציה חשבו שעמדנו למות והלכו
משם. הצלחנו
לברוח מהבית הבוער ועזבנו את הכפר.
<b>בדרך מצאנו
את הגופה של אבא שלי, וכמה
מטרים הלאה משם את זאת של אחי</b>.
הגענו למחנה
פליטים של האו""ם
בצ'אד,
שם גרנו ביחד
עד 2007. בנקודה
הזאת החלטתי שלא יכולתי יותר לחיות בתנאים
הקשים של המחנה. במקום
לחזור לכפר שלנו ולהילחם,<b> רציתי
ללמוד</b>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><b>הבנתי
שנוכל לקבל את הבית שלנו בחזרה גם על ידי
לימודים, על
ידי שנלמד ונבין את המצב הפוליטי ואיך
הוא התפתח, ועל
ידי מציאת דרכים לא אלימות כדי ליצור שלום
ולסיים את הטבח</b>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">עזבתי

<p style=""text-align: right;"">חציתי את
צ'אד
ומשם הגעתי ללוב. בעיר
בנגאזי התחלתי ללמוד אנגלית ועבדתי בחנות
כדי להרוויח כמה פרוטות. אחרי
שנה וחצי עברתי עם חבר למצרים, שם
הלימודים היו אמורים להיות יותר נגישים,
לפי השמועה.
אבל במציאות,
הממשל המצרי
והסודאני שיתפו פעולה כדי להחזיר את פליטי
דארפור לארצם, שם
חיכתה להם תקופת זמן לא ידועה בכלא,
או מוות.
נאלצתי לעזוב
את מצרים.</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">יום אחד צפיתי
בטלוויזיה בסרט דוקומנטרי על השואה.
הדבר היחיד
שידעתי עד אז על היהודים הוא שמדינת ישראל
היא המדינה היהודית היחידה בעולם.
כשצפיתי
בסרט, התוודעתי
להיסטוריה של העם היהודי, לשחרורם
מהעבדות במצרים, לרדיפות
והאפליות שהם סבלו במהלך המאות,
עד שהם יכלו
להקים לעצמם מדינה משלהם ולחיות בה
בחופשיות. הזדהיתי
עם הסיפור הזה ולא היה לי ספק שהעם היהודי
יזדהה עם הסיפור שלי ושל עמי:
הייתי חייב
ללכת לישראל. <br/></p>

<br/><p style=""text-align: right;"">יצרתי קשר
עם מישהו שהבריח אנשים מעבר לגבול,
לישראל.
היינו 12
אנשים בקבוצה,

והחבר שלי. בלילה,
זחלנו לכיוון
החלק הישראלי, נמנעים
מהחיילים המצריים. פתאום,
מישהו בקבוצה
נתקף פאניקה: הוא
קפץ על רגליו והתחיל לצעוק. שלושה
כדורים בראש, שנורו
על ידי החיילים, הרגו
אותו במקום. החיילים
התחילו עכשיו לבוא לכיווננו, ו<b>לא
הייתה לנו ברירה אלא לקום ולהתחיל לרוץ
לכיוון גדר הגבול הישראלי ולקוות שהכדורים
לא יפגעו בנו</b>. זרקנו
את כל מה שהיה לנו ו<b>רצנו, רצנו
בכל כוחנו</b>. <b>חברי
ואני רצנו כמה שיותר מהר, מחזיקים
ידיים</b>. בדרך,
אדם אחר
מהקבוצה נורה למוות, ומיד
אחריו עוד אחד שחזר אחורה כדי לעזור לו.
אנחנו שנשארנו
הגענו לגדר וטיפסנו עליה לצד השני.
החיילים
הישראלים נתנו לנו מים וטיפלו בפצעים
שלנו.

נלקחתי לבית

<p><a name=""Deutsch"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Mein Name ist <b>Usumain (Ismail) Baraka</b>. Ich brauche Ihre Hilfe, damit ich Politikwissenschaften studieren kann. Das Studium bedeutet für mich einen wichtigen Schritt auf meinem Weg, ein Vorreiter ziviler Konfliktlösung zu sein. Im Folgenden meine Geschichte: </p>
<p></p>
<p>Ich wurde 1994 in Dirhata,
einem kleinen Dorf in <b>Darfur</b> im
West-Sudan, geboren. Als die Dschandschawid-Milizen 2003 in das Dorf kamen, um
alle männlichen Bewohner zu töten, war ich neun Jahre alt. Mein Vater und mein
Bruder wurden getötet. Ich überlebte, weil mich meine Mutter als Mädchen
verkleidete. Die Mörder schlugen sie und fragten, wo ihre anderen Söhne seien,
aber sie antwortete, dass ihr nur noch Töchter geblieben wären: Sie meinte
meine Schwestern und mich. Die Miliz zündete das Haus an und wartete vor der
Tür, um sicher zu gehen, dass wir tot waren. Meine Mutter sagte uns, dass wir
weinen und schreien sollten. So dachte die Miliz, dass wir gerade starben und
verließ ihren Posten. Wir flüchteten aus dem brennenden Haus und verließen das
Dorf. <b>Auf dem Weg entdeckten wir den
Körper meines Vaters, wenige Meter weiter den meines Bruders</b>. Wir
erreichten ein UN-Flüchtlingscamp im Tschad, in dem wir bis 2007 lebten. In
diesem Jahr entschloss ich mich, die miserablen Zustände in dem Camp nicht
länger zu ertragen. Aber anstatt in mein Dorf zurückzukehren und zu kämpfen, <b>wollte
ich studieren</b>. </p>
<p><b>Denn ich verstand, dass wir unser Zuhause nur
zurückgewinnen konnten, wenn wir studierten, wenn wir die politische Situation
verstünden und wie es dazu gekommen war. Wenn wir gewaltlose Wege entwickelten,
Frieden zu schließen und den Genozid zu beenden.</b></p>
<p>Darum verließ ich das
UN-Flüchtlingscamp. <b>Ich war dreizehn Jahre alt</b>, und ließ meine
geliebte  Familie zurück.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440443638/m5rcj1x72pjk0dt0piq7.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 434px; height: 434px;""/></p>
<p>Ich durchquerte den Tschad
und erreichte Libyen. In Bengazi begann ich, Englisch zu lernen und in einem
Shop zu arbeiten, um etwas Geld zu verdienen. Nach anderthalb Jahren zog ich
mit einem Freund nach Ägypten, wo es meinen Informationen nach günstig sein sollte
zu studieren. Aber die ägyptische und die sudanesische Regierungen hatten eine
Übereinkunft getroffen, Menschen aus Darfur zurückzuschicken, <b>wo sie</b> <b>anschließend eine unbegrenzte Gefängnishaft oder der Tod erwarteten</b>.
Deshalb musste ich Ägypten verlassen.</p>
<p>Eines Tages sah ich im
Fernsehen <b>eine Dokumentation über die Shoah</b>, den jüdischen Holocaust.
Das Einzige, was ich bis zu diesem Zeitpunkt über Juden wusste, war, dass
Israel das einzige jüdische Land in der Welt ist. Durch die Dokumentation erfuhr
ich zum ersten Mal von der <b>Geschichte der
Juden</b>, der <b>Befreiung aus der
Sklaverei in Ägypten</b>, den anschließenden Jahrtausenden der Verfolgung und Diskriminierung,
bis sie schließlich ihr eigenes Land gründen konnten, um in Freiheit zu leben. <b>Ich konnte mich mit dieser Geschichte identifizieren
</b>und hatte daher keinen Zweifel, dass die Juden meiner Geschichte und der
Geschichte meiner Leute Empathie entgegen bringen würden: <b>Ich musste nach
Israel gehen</b>.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440443703/njwekanwsqojj3gfcbvs.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 421px; height: 421px;""/></p>
<p>Also nahm ich mit jemandem
Kontakt auf, der Migranten über die Grenze nach Israel schleuste. Wir waren
zwölf Menschen, einschließlich meines Freundes und mir. Eines Nachts krochen
wir in Richtung der israelischen Grenze, immer darauf bedacht, die ägyptischen
Soldaten zu meiden. Plötzlich geriet einer aus unserer Gruppe in Panik: Er
sprang auf und begann zu brüllen. Die drei Kugeln, die ihn in den Kopf trafen,
töteten ihn sofort. Die Soldaten bewegten sich nun in unsere Richtung, so dass <b>wir keine Wahl hatten als in Richtung der
israelischen Grenze loszulaufen und zu hoffen, dass uns die Kugeln nicht
treffen würden</b>. Also ließen wir alles fallen, was wir mit uns genommen
hatten und <b>rannten, rannten, rannten.
Mein Freund und ich liefen so schnell wir konnten, jeder an der Hand des anderen</b>.
Auf dem Weg wurde ein anderer Mann aus unserer Gruppe erschossen, kurz darauf
sein Freund, der umgekehrt war, um ihm beizustehen. Der Rest unserer Gruppe
erreichte den Grenzzaun und kletterte hinüber. Die israelischen Soldaten gaben
uns Wasser und versorgten unsere Wunden. </p>
<p>Ich wurde in ein Gefängnis
gebracht, wo ich eineinhalb Monate im Erwachsenentrakt verblieb. Mit meiner
Entlassung erhielt ich ein zeitlich begrenztes Visum und zog nach Tel Aviv, wo
ich anschließend ohne eine wirkliche Perspektive lebte. Dort nahm ich meine
Englischstudien wieder auf. 2010 zog ich nach <b>Yemin Orde, ein Jugenddorf, das Migrant*innen und Geflüchtete</b> mit
einer Unterkunft versorgt und ihnen die Möglichkeit bietet zu studieren. <b>Das erste Mal seit meiner Ankunft in Israel
fühlte ich mich sicher</b>. Ich begann, Hebräisch zu lernen und die Schule zu
besuchen. 2014 konnte ich meine Schulausbildung abschließen. <b>Seitdem habe
ich ehrenamtlich für das Dorf gearbeitet, um etwas von dem zurückzugeben, was
mir dort an Großzügigkeit zuteilwurde</b>.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440443754/tcx4twcx4ywvlhr5fxoj.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 583.009411764706px; height: 437px;""/></p>
<p><b>Nun würde ich gerne den
nächsten Schritt gehen und eine Hochschulbildung erlangen</b>. Zwei israelische Institutionen haben mich bereits für
einen Bachelorstudiengang akzeptiert: Die renommierte <a href=""http://portal.idc.ac.il/en/schools/government/homepage/pages/homepage.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lauder School of Government, Diplomacy and Strategy am Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya</a> (IDC)
sowie die <a href=""https://www.mta.ac.il/he-il/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tel Aviv-Yafo Academy für den Studiengang Politics and Government</a>. Die
Studiengebühren für diese Studiengänge sind sehr hoch, denn das israelische Hochschulsystem
wie das amerikanische strukturiert ist. In meinem jetzigen Zustand darf ich
Israel nicht verlassen, weil mein Aufenthaltserlaubnis jederzeit ablaufen
könnte. Momentan bin ich davor geschützt nur dank des Jugenddorfes. Die
Möglichkeit, woanders zu studieren, ist mir daher zurzeit verweigert.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440443965/op7qiojvj3h3qdfx3gqn.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 339.312741312741px; height: 453px;""/></p>
<p><b>Das Studium ist der Grund, aus dem ich das
Flüchtlingscamp im Tschad verlassen habe. Trotz aller Widerstände, die sich mir
seitdem in den Weg gestellt haben, habe ich dieses Ziel und diesen Traum nie
aus den Augen verloren. </b></p>
<p>Ich habe hart
gearbeitet, um gute Noten in der Schule zu bekommen, und auch die Zusage zweier
israelischer Hochschulinstitutionen ist das Ergebnis harter Arbeit. Mein Ziel
ist es, einen Abschluss in Politikwissenschaft und Internationalen Beziehungen
zu erhalten. Anschließend möchte ich in mein Land zurückgehen und dabei helfen,
ein friedvolles Zusammenleben zu ermöglichen. <b>Außerdem möchte ich Brücken
bauen zwischen meinem ersten Zuhause, Afrika, und meinem zweiten Zuhause,
Israel</b> – dem Land jener Menschen, von denen ich noch immer annehme, dass

bisogno del tuo sostegno per finanziare i miei studi. Il mio sogno è poter studiare
politica internazionale, diplomazia e diritto per contribuire alla risoluzione
di conflitti e situazioni di crisi. Questa è la mia storia:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sono nato nel 1994 a Dirhata, un piccolo
villaggio nel <b>Darfur</b>, nella parte occidentale del Sudan. Nel 2003,
quando le milizie degli Janjaweed sono arrivate al mio villaggio per uccidere
tutti gli uomini e i bambini maschi, avevo nove anni. Mio padre e mio fratello maggiore
sono stati uccisi a fucilate. Mia mamma mi ha fatto indossare i vestiti delle
mie sorelle, facendomi passare per una bambina. Così mi sono salvato. I
miliziani l’hanno colpita e colpita, chiedendole dove fossero i suoi altri
figli, ma lei ha insistito che le erano rimaste solo bambine. I miliziani ci
hanno chiusi nella nostra casa di legno e le hanno dato fuoco, aspettando fuori
dalla porta per essere sicuri che nessuno sopravvivesse. Mia mamma ci ha detto
di piangere e gridare. In questo modo i miliziani hanno creduto che stessimo
morendo e se ne sono andati. Mia mamma ha aperto uno squarcio nel legno, siamo
scappati dalla casa in fiamme e abbiamo abbandonato il villaggio alle nostre
spalle. <b>Fuggendo per i campi, abbiamo trovato il corpo di mio padre e dopo
qualche metro, quello di mio fratello</b>. Siamo arrivati a un campo profughi
dell’ONU nel Chad, dove abbiamo vissuto insieme fino al 2007. A quel punto non
ce l’ho più fatta a vivere nelle condizioni disumane del campo. Invece di
tornare al mio villaggio e combattere,<b> volevo studiare.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Allora ho capito che l’unica speranza di tornare
un giorno nel mio paese con i miei cari fosse studiare, sforzarsi di capire la
situazione politica e la sua evoluzione, cercare di trovare soluzioni non
violente per aiutare a risolvere i conflitti in corso e contribuire a costruire
la pace. </b></p>
<p><b>Quando ho lasciato il campo profughi,
mettendomi in viaggio da solo</b> e lasciando dietro di me i miei cari, <b>avevo solo tredici anni</b>. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440440592/n1biefxhv5dyikqb2b5m.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 426px; height: 426px;""/></p>
<p>Ho attraversato il Chad e sono arrivato in
Libia. Nella città di Bengasi ho iniziato a studiare l'inglese e a lavorare in
una piccola bottega, guadagnandomi così da vivere. Dopo un anno e mezzo mi sono
spostato con un amico in Egitto, dove ci avevano detto che avremmo potuto
studiare e gli studi non sarebbero stati troppo costosi. Ma il governo egiziano
stava collaborando con quello sudanese e rimandava i profughi del Darfur in Sudan, dove ci aspettava o imprigionamento a vita e tortura o la
morte. Dovevo lasciare l’Egitto. </p>
<p><b>Un giorno ho visto in televisione un documentario
sulla Shoah</b>, l’olocausto
ebraico. L’unica cosa che sapevo del popolo ebraico era che Israele è l’unico
stato ebraico nel mondo. Guardando il documentario, sono venuto a conoscenza
per la prima volta della storia degli ebrei, della <b>liberazione dalla
schiavitù in Egitto</b> raccontata nella Bibbia, delle persecuzioni e
discriminazioni sofferte nei secoli, fino alla fondazione dello stato ebraico,
dove gli ebrei possono vivere in libertà. Ho sentito un forte senso di
identificazione con la storia del popolo ebraico e non ho avuto dubbi che gli
israeliani avrebbero solidarizzato con la mia storia e la storia del mio
popolo: <b>ho deciso che dovevo andare in Israele</b>.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440440660/kvjnl6nley7j3aztkucw.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 428px; height: 428px;""/></p>
<p>Sono entrato in contatto con un trafficante di migranti che
faceva la spola fino al confine con Israele. Eravamo dodici persone, tra cui io
e il mio amico. Nella notte, ci siamo avvicinati al confine israeliano
strisciando e abbiamo cercato di evitare i soldati egiziani con l’aiuto del
buio. Improvvisamente, qualcuno nel gruppo ha avuto un attacco di panico, è
saltato in piedi e ha iniziato a gridare. Tre pallottole nella testa, sparate
dai soldati, lo hanno ucciso sul posto. I soldati hanno quindi iniziato a
venire nella nostra direzione. Non avevamo altra scelta che correre verso la
recinsione del confine israeliano e sperare che le pallottole non ci colpissero.
Abbiamo gettato tutto quello che avevamo con noi e abbiamo <b>corso, corso,
corso</b>. <b>Io e il mio amico abbiamo corso veloce quanto potevamo, tenendoci per
mano</b>. Un altro uomo del gruppo è stato colpito a morte, e con lui il suo
amico che era tornato indietro per aiutarlo. Siamo riusciti a raggiungere la
recinsione di filo spinato e a scavalcarla. I soldati israeliani ci sono venuti
incontro, ci hanno dato acqua e hanno curato le nostre ferite.</p>
<p>Sono stato portato in una prigione, dove sono rimasto un
mese e mezzo nel settore degli adulti. Quando sono stato rilasciato, mi hanno
dato un visto temporaneo. Sono andato a Tel Aviv, dove ho vissuto in grande
incertezza. Ma anche lì sono riuscito a continuare a studiare inglese. Nel 2010
<b>sono stato accolto a Yemin Orde, un villaggio che ospita giovani migranti e
rifugiati</b>, fornendo loro un posto dove vivere e la possibilità di studiare.
<b>Mi sono sentito al sicuro per la prima volta</b> da quando sono arrivato in
Israele. Ho studiato l’ebraico e fatto il liceo nel villaggio di accoglienza.
Nel 2014 ho fatto la maturità. Da allora, <b>faccio volontariato</b> nel
villaggio, <b>cercando di dare indietro qualcosa di quello che mi è stato donato
così generosamente</b>.</p>

perché il sistema universitario israeliano funziona come quello americano.
Nella mia situazione attuale non posso lasciare Israele, in quanto ho solo un
visto temporaneo che potrebbe essere revocato in ogni momento se non fosse per
la protezione che il villaggio Yemin Orde mi garantisce. Al momento non ho
quindi la possibilità di andare a studiare da un’altra parte.<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440440804/trhysm1fiizxhk0qd0a6.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 330.958412098299px; height: 441px;""/></p>
<p><b>Studiare è il motivo per cui ho lasciato il

<p>Ho studiato duramente per ottenere buoni

accademiche di alto livello è il frutto di merito, impegno e intenso lavoro. Il
mio più grande desiderio è avere la possibilità di studiare e poter ottenere
una laurea in scienze politiche e relazioni internazionali. Voglio tornare al
mio paese e aiutare la mia gente a vivere in pace nella loro terra. <b>Voglio
costruire un ponte tra la mia prima casa, l’Africa, e la mia seconda casa,

meglio di chiunque altro con la mia situazione, dal momento che il popolo di
Israele ha vissuto esattamente la mia stessa tragica e dolorosa esperienza.</p>

fino ad ora, continuo ad aiutare altri rifugiati che vivono in Israele e vanno
incontro a mille difficoltà, e continuo a visitare le persone incarcerate nel

</div></div>","English textHebrew textText auf DeutschTesto in italianoMy name is Usumain (Ismail) Baraka. I need your help in order to finance my undergraduate studies in political science, so that I can pursue my dream of being in the front line to end conflicts in diplomatic ways. This is my story:
I was born in 1994 in Dirhata, a small village in Darfur, in the western part of Sudan. In 2003, when the Janjaweed militias came to kill all the males, I was nine years old. My father and older brother were shot dead. I was saved only because my mother dressed me as a girl. The killers hit her and asked where her other sons were, but she said she only had daughters left: these were my sisters and I. The militias burned the house, waiting outside to make sure we were dead. My mother told us to cry and shout. The militias thus thought we were dying and left the place. We escaped the burning house and left the village. On the way, we spotted my fatherʼs body, and few meters ahead my brotherʼs. We arrived to a UN refugees camp in Chad, in which we lived together until 2007. At that point I decided I could no longer live in the hard conditions of the camp. Rather than going back to our village and fight, I wanted to study. 
I realized we could gain back our homes by studying, by understanding the political situation and how it evolved, and by coming up with non-violent ways to make peace and end the genocide. 
I left the UN camp when I was only thirteen, leaving behind my
beloved ones.



I crossed Chad and reached Libya. In the city of Bengazi I started learning English and I worked in a shop, earning some money for living. After a year and a half I moved with a friend to Egypt, where studying was cheap, according to what I had heard. But the Egyptian and Sudanese governments collaborated to send the Darfur people back, only to face either limitless imprisonment or death. I had to leave Egypt.
One day, on the television, I watched a
documentary about the Shoah, the Jewish Holocaust. The only thing I knew about
the Jews was that Israel is the only Jewish country in the world. Watching the
documentary, I learned about the Jewish people's past, about their being freed
from slavery in Egypt, about the persecutions and discrimination they have suffered
over the centuries until they were able to found their own country and live
there freely. I could identify myself with this story and I had no doubt that
the Jewish people would sympathize with my and my people's story: I had to go
to Israel.



I got in touch with someone who smuggled migrants
over the border to Israel. We were twelve people in the group, including me and
my friend. At night, we crawled towards the Israeli part, trying to avoid the
Egyptian soldiers. Then, suddenly, someone in the group got panicked: he jumped to his feet and started shouting. Three bullets in the head, shot by the
soldiers, killed him on the spot. The soldiers now came in our direction and we
had no choice but to start running towards the Israeli border fence and hope
that the bullets would not hit us. We dropped everything we had and ran, ran
ran. My friend and I ran as fast as we could, holding hands. On the way,
another man in the group was shot dead, followed by his fellow who came back to
assist him. The rest of us reached the border fence and climbed on it. The
Israeli soldiers gave us water and treated our wounds.
I was taken to a prison, where I spent a month and
a half in the adults section. When I was released, I got a temporary visa and moved
to Tel Aviv, where I lived without any clear purpose. But I kept learning
English. In 2010 I moved to Yemin Orde, a youth village that provides migrants and refugees with
a place to live in and with the possibility to study. I felt safe for the first
time since I had arrived to Israel. I learned Hebrew and did high school there.
In 2014, I finished my exams. Since then, I have been volunteering in the
village, trying to give back at least some of what I have received there so
generously.



Now I would like to make the next step and acquire
higher education. I have already been accepted to undergraduate studies in two
Israeli institutions, between which I have to choose: the prestigious Lauder
School of Government, Diplomacy and Strategy at the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya (IDC) and the
first degree in Politics and Government at the Tel Aviv-Yafo Academy.




Studying is the reason I why left the camp in
Chad. Despite all the difficulties I encountered ever since, I have never
forgotten this goal and dream. 
I learned hard to get good grades in high school,
and also the acceptance to the two institutions of higher education is the
fruit of hard work. I want to have a degree in political science and
international relations. I want to go back to my country and help my people
live in peace on their land. I want to build a bridge between my first
homeland, Africa, and my second one, Israel – the country of the people who I am still
convinced can best identify with my situation, since they had precisely the
same unfortunate experience.




While I am pursuing my goals, I am not forgetting
my brothers and sisters who have gone through the same hell like me. As I have
been doing so far, I will keep helping other refugees who live in Israel and
have difficulties, and visiting inmates in detention camps for refugees. I am
also not forgetting the youth village that has given me the possibility to live
well and study. I am continuing to volunteer in the various facilities of the
village. 



The only thing that separates me from a first
degree are the fees. I would be endlessly grateful to have your support, so
that I can accomplish my goal, graduate successfully and contribute in peaceful
ways to end conflicts that have already demanded too many lives.


שמי אוסומעין
(איסמעיל)
בארכה.
אני זקוק
לעזרתך כדי לממן את לימודי התואר הראשון
שלי במדעי המדינה, כדי
שאוכל להגשים את חלומי ולהילחם כדי לסיים
קונפליקטים בדרכים דיפלומטיות.
זה הסיפור
שלי.



נולדתי בשנת
1994 בדירהטה,
כפר קטן במחוז
דארפור שבמערב סודאן. ב-2003,
כאשר מיליציות
הג'נג'אווידים
באו להרוג את כל הגברים והילדים הזכרים,
הייתי בן
תשע. אבי
ואחי הגדול נורו למוות. אני
ניצלתי רק בזכות אמי שהלבישה אותי כמו
ילדה. הרוצחים
הכו אותה ושאלו אותה איפה הבנים האחרים
שלה, אבל
היא אמרה שנותרו לה רק בנות: אלו
היו אחיותיי ואני. אנשי
המיליציה הציתו את הבית באש, וחיכו
בחוץ כדי לוודא שנשרפנו. אמי
אמרה לנו לצעוק חזק ולבכות, ככה
אנשי המיליציה חשבו שעמדנו למות והלכו
משם. הצלחנו
לברוח מהבית הבוער ועזבנו את הכפר.
בדרך מצאנו
את הגופה של אבא שלי, וכמה
מטרים הלאה משם את זאת של אחי.
הגענו למחנה
פליטים של האו""ם
בצ'אד,
שם גרנו ביחד
עד 2007. בנקודה
הזאת החלטתי שלא יכולתי יותר לחיות בתנאים
הקשים של המחנה. במקום
לחזור לכפר שלנו ולהילחם, רציתי
ללמוד.
הבנתי
שנוכל לקבל את הבית שלנו בחזרה גם על ידי
לימודים, על
ידי שנלמד ונבין את המצב הפוליטי ואיך
הוא התפתח, ועל
ידי מציאת דרכים לא אלימות כדי ליצור שלום
ולסיים את הטבח.
עזבתי
את מחנה האו""ם
כשהייתי רק בן 13, והשארתי
מאחוריי את שרידי משפחתי האהובה.


חציתי את
צ'אד
ומשם הגעתי ללוב. בעיר
בנגאזי התחלתי ללמוד אנגלית ועבדתי בחנות
כדי להרוויח כמה פרוטות. אחרי
שנה וחצי עברתי עם חבר למצרים, שם
הלימודים היו אמורים להיות יותר נגישים,
לפי השמועה.
אבל במציאות,
הממשל המצרי
והסודאני שיתפו פעולה כדי להחזיר את פליטי
דארפור לארצם, שם
חיכתה להם תקופת זמן לא ידועה בכלא,
או מוות.
נאלצתי לעזוב
את מצרים.
יום אחד צפיתי
בטלוויזיה בסרט דוקומנטרי על השואה.
הדבר היחיד
שידעתי עד אז על היהודים הוא שמדינת ישראל
היא המדינה היהודית היחידה בעולם.
כשצפיתי
בסרט, התוודעתי
להיסטוריה של העם היהודי, לשחרורם
מהעבדות במצרים, לרדיפות
והאפליות שהם סבלו במהלך המאות,
עד שהם יכלו
להקים לעצמם מדינה משלהם ולחיות בה
בחופשיות. הזדהיתי
עם הסיפור הזה ולא היה לי ספק שהעם היהודי
יזדהה עם הסיפור שלי ושל עמי:
הייתי חייב
ללכת לישראל. 


יצרתי קשר
עם מישהו שהבריח אנשים מעבר לגבול,
לישראל.
היינו 12
אנשים בקבוצה,
כולל אני
והחבר שלי. בלילה,
זחלנו לכיוון
החלק הישראלי, נמנעים
מהחיילים המצריים. פתאום,
מישהו בקבוצה
נתקף פאניקה: הוא
קפץ על רגליו והתחיל לצעוק. שלושה
כדורים בראש, שנורו
על ידי החיילים, הרגו
אותו במקום. החיילים
התחילו עכשיו לבוא לכיווננו, ולא
הייתה לנו ברירה אלא לקום ולהתחיל לרוץ
לכיוון גדר הגבול הישראלי ולקוות שהכדורים
לא יפגעו בנו. זרקנו
את כל מה שהיה לנו ורצנו, רצנו
בכל כוחנו. חברי
ואני רצנו כמה שיותר מהר, מחזיקים
ידיים. בדרך,
אדם אחר
מהקבוצה נורה למוות, ומיד
אחריו עוד אחד שחזר אחורה כדי לעזור לו.
אנחנו שנשארנו
הגענו לגדר וטיפסנו עליה לצד השני.
החיילים
הישראלים נתנו לנו מים וטיפלו בפצעים
שלנו.




נלקחתי לבית
כלא, שם
שהיתי חודש וחצי במדור של המבוגרים.
כשהשתחררתי,
קיבלתי ויזה
זמנית והגעתי לתל אביב, שם
חייתי ללא מטרה ברורה. אבל
המשכתי ללמוד אנגלית. בשנת
2010 עברתי
לימין אורד, כפר
נוער שמעניק למהגרים ופליטים מקום לגור
בו ואפשרות ללמוד. בפעם
הראשונה מאז הגעתי לישראל הרגשתי בטוח.
למדתי עברית
ועשיתי לימודי בית ספר תיכון.
בשנת 2014
סיימתי בהצלחה
את בחינות הבגרות. מאז
אני מתנדב בכפר במטרה לתת חזרה ולו מעט
מכל מה שקיבלתי שם בנדיבות כה גדולה.



עכשיו אני
רוצה לעשות את הצעד הבא ולהתחיל לימודים
גבוהים. התקבלתי
ללימודי תואר ראשון בשני מוסדות ישראלים,
ביניהם אני
צריך לבחור: התוכנית
היוקרתית בבית הספר לאודר לממשל,
דיפלומטיה
ואסטרטגיה במרכז הבין תחומי הרצליה ולימודי תואר
ראשון בפוליטיקה וממשל באקדמית תל אביב-יפו.
הרצון ללמוד
הוא זה שהביא אותי לעזוב את המחנה בצ'אד.
למרות כל
הקשיים מאז, לא
שכחתי את המטרה הזאת – את החלום הזה.
למדתי קשה
כדי לקבל ציונים טובים בתיכון,
וגם הקבלה
לשני המוסדות להשכלה גבוהה היא פרי עבודה
קשה. אני
רוצה לעשות תואר במדעי המדינה ויחסים
בינלאומיים. אני
רוצה לחזור לארץ שלי ולעזור לאנשים שלי
לחיות בשלום על אדמתם. אני
רוצה לבנות גשר בין מולדתי הראשונה,
אפריקה,
ובין מולדתי
השנייה, ישראל
– הארץ בה חי העם שאני עדיין משוכנע שהוא
היחיד שיכול להזדהות עם המצב שלי,
משום שהוא
עבר בדיוק את אותה חוויה קשה.


בזמן שאני
מגשים את מטרותיי, אני
לא שוכח את אחיי ואחיותיי שעברו את אותו
הגיהנום כמוני. כמו
עד עכשיו, אני
אמשיך לעזור לפליטים אחרים שחיים בארץ
ושיש להם קשיים, ולבקר
את אלו שנמצאים בהסגר. אני
גם לא שוכח את כפר הנוער שנתן לי את האפשרות
לחיות טוב וללמוד. אני
ממשיך להתנדב במוסדות השונים שם.


הדבר היחיד
שמפריד ביני ובין התואר הראשון הוא שכר
הלימוד. אני
אהיה אסיר תודה אם תתמכו בי, כדי
שאוכל להגשים את מטרתי: לסיים
בהצלחה את לימודי התואר ולתרום בדרכי
שלום לסיומם של קונפליקטים שכבר תבעו
יותר מדי חיים.



Mein Name ist Usumain (Ismail) Baraka. Ich brauche Ihre Hilfe, damit ich Politikwissenschaften studieren kann. Das Studium bedeutet für mich einen wichtigen Schritt auf meinem Weg, ein Vorreiter ziviler Konfliktlösung zu sein. Im Folgenden meine Geschichte: 

Ich wurde 1994 in Dirhata,
einem kleinen Dorf in Darfur im
West-Sudan, geboren. Als die Dschandschawid-Milizen 2003 in das Dorf kamen, um
alle männlichen Bewohner zu töten, war ich neun Jahre alt. Mein Vater und mein
Bruder wurden getötet. Ich überlebte, weil mich meine Mutter als Mädchen
verkleidete. Die Mörder schlugen sie und fragten, wo ihre anderen Söhne seien,
aber sie antwortete, dass ihr nur noch Töchter geblieben wären: Sie meinte
meine Schwestern und mich. Die Miliz zündete das Haus an und wartete vor der
Tür, um sicher zu gehen, dass wir tot waren. Meine Mutter sagte uns, dass wir
weinen und schreien sollten. So dachte die Miliz, dass wir gerade starben und
verließ ihren Posten. Wir flüchteten aus dem brennenden Haus und verließen das
Dorf. Auf dem Weg entdeckten wir den
Körper meines Vaters, wenige Meter weiter den meines Bruders. Wir
erreichten ein UN-Flüchtlingscamp im Tschad, in dem wir bis 2007 lebten. In
diesem Jahr entschloss ich mich, die miserablen Zustände in dem Camp nicht
länger zu ertragen. Aber anstatt in mein Dorf zurückzukehren und zu kämpfen, wollte
ich studieren. 
Denn ich verstand, dass wir unser Zuhause nur
zurückgewinnen konnten, wenn wir studierten, wenn wir die politische Situation
verstünden und wie es dazu gekommen war. Wenn wir gewaltlose Wege entwickelten,
Frieden zu schließen und den Genozid zu beenden.
Darum verließ ich das
UN-Flüchtlingscamp. Ich war dreizehn Jahre alt, und ließ meine
geliebte  Familie zurück.

Ich durchquerte den Tschad
und erreichte Libyen. In Bengazi begann ich, Englisch zu lernen und in einem
Shop zu arbeiten, um etwas Geld zu verdienen. Nach anderthalb Jahren zog ich
mit einem Freund nach Ägypten, wo es meinen Informationen nach günstig sein sollte
zu studieren. Aber die ägyptische und die sudanesische Regierungen hatten eine
Übereinkunft getroffen, Menschen aus Darfur zurückzuschicken, wo sie anschließend eine unbegrenzte Gefängnishaft oder der Tod erwarteten.
Deshalb musste ich Ägypten verlassen.
Eines Tages sah ich im
Fernsehen eine Dokumentation über die Shoah, den jüdischen Holocaust.
Das Einzige, was ich bis zu diesem Zeitpunkt über Juden wusste, war, dass
Israel das einzige jüdische Land in der Welt ist. Durch die Dokumentation erfuhr
ich zum ersten Mal von der Geschichte der
Juden, der Befreiung aus der
Sklaverei in Ägypten, den anschließenden Jahrtausenden der Verfolgung und Diskriminierung,
bis sie schließlich ihr eigenes Land gründen konnten, um in Freiheit zu leben. Ich konnte mich mit dieser Geschichte identifizieren
und hatte daher keinen Zweifel, dass die Juden meiner Geschichte und der
Geschichte meiner Leute Empathie entgegen bringen würden: Ich musste nach
Israel gehen.

Also nahm ich mit jemandem
Kontakt auf, der Migranten über die Grenze nach Israel schleuste. Wir waren
zwölf Menschen, einschließlich meines Freundes und mir. Eines Nachts krochen
wir in Richtung der israelischen Grenze, immer darauf bedacht, die ägyptischen
Soldaten zu meiden. Plötzlich geriet einer aus unserer Gruppe in Panik: Er
sprang auf und begann zu brüllen. Die drei Kugeln, die ihn in den Kopf trafen,
töteten ihn sofort. Die Soldaten bewegten sich nun in unsere Richtung, so dass wir keine Wahl hatten als in Richtung der
israelischen Grenze loszulaufen und zu hoffen, dass uns die Kugeln nicht
treffen würden. Also ließen wir alles fallen, was wir mit uns genommen
hatten und rannten, rannten, rannten.
Mein Freund und ich liefen so schnell wir konnten, jeder an der Hand des anderen.
Auf dem Weg wurde ein anderer Mann aus unserer Gruppe erschossen, kurz darauf
sein Freund, der umgekehrt war, um ihm beizustehen. Der Rest unserer Gruppe
erreichte den Grenzzaun und kletterte hinüber. Die israelischen Soldaten gaben
uns Wasser und versorgten unsere Wunden. 
Ich wurde in ein Gefängnis
gebracht, wo ich eineinhalb Monate im Erwachsenentrakt verblieb. Mit meiner
Entlassung erhielt ich ein zeitlich begrenztes Visum und zog nach Tel Aviv, wo
ich anschließend ohne eine wirkliche Perspektive lebte. Dort nahm ich meine
Englischstudien wieder auf. 2010 zog ich nach Yemin Orde, ein Jugenddorf, das Migrant*innen und Geflüchtete mit
einer Unterkunft versorgt und ihnen die Möglichkeit bietet zu studieren. Das erste Mal seit meiner Ankunft in Israel
fühlte ich mich sicher. Ich begann, Hebräisch zu lernen und die Schule zu
besuchen. 2014 konnte ich meine Schulausbildung abschließen. Seitdem habe
ich ehrenamtlich für das Dorf gearbeitet, um etwas von dem zurückzugeben, was
mir dort an Großzügigkeit zuteilwurde.

Nun würde ich gerne den
nächsten Schritt gehen und eine Hochschulbildung erlangen. Zwei israelische Institutionen haben mich bereits für
einen Bachelorstudiengang akzeptiert: Die renommierte Lauder School of Government, Diplomacy and Strategy am Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya (IDC)
sowie die Tel Aviv-Yafo Academy für den Studiengang Politics and Government. Die
Studiengebühren für diese Studiengänge sind sehr hoch, denn das israelische Hochschulsystem
wie das amerikanische strukturiert ist. In meinem jetzigen Zustand darf ich
Israel nicht verlassen, weil mein Aufenthaltserlaubnis jederzeit ablaufen
könnte. Momentan bin ich davor geschützt nur dank des Jugenddorfes. Die
Möglichkeit, woanders zu studieren, ist mir daher zurzeit verweigert.

Das Studium ist der Grund, aus dem ich das
Flüchtlingscamp im Tschad verlassen habe. Trotz aller Widerstände, die sich mir
seitdem in den Weg gestellt haben, habe ich dieses Ziel und diesen Traum nie
aus den Augen verloren. 
Ich habe hart
gearbeitet, um gute Noten in der Schule zu bekommen, und auch die Zusage zweier
israelischer Hochschulinstitutionen ist das Ergebnis harter Arbeit. Mein Ziel
ist es, einen Abschluss in Politikwissenschaft und Internationalen Beziehungen
zu erhalten. Anschließend möchte ich in mein Land zurückgehen und dabei helfen,
ein friedvolles Zusammenleben zu ermöglichen. Außerdem möchte ich Brücken
bauen zwischen meinem ersten Zuhause, Afrika, und meinem zweiten Zuhause,
Israel – dem Land jener Menschen, von denen ich noch immer annehme, dass
sie meine Situation am besten nachvollziehen können, da sie die gleichen Erfahrungen
gemacht haben wie ich. 

Während ich diese
Ziele verfolge, vergesse ich nicht meine Brüder und Schwestern, die durch die
gleiche Hölle gegangen sind wie ich. Wie bisher werde ich daher die Insassen
der Internierungslager für Geflüchtete besuchen und Geflüchteten in Israel helfen,
die Schwierigkeiten haben. Außerdem werde ich das Jugenddorf nicht vergessen,
das mir die Möglichkeit eröffnete, gut zu leben und zu studieren. Daher werde
ich auch weiterhin als Freiwilliger für die unterschiedlichen Einrichtungen des
Dorfes arbeiten. 

Das Einzige, was
mich nun noch von meinem ersten Abschluss trennt, sind die Studiengebühren. 
Ich
wäre unendlich dankbar für Ihre Unterstützung. Sie wäre ein wichtiger Beitrag zur Realisierung meines persönlichen
Zieles, das gleichsam eine politische Vision ist: Eine Form ziviler
Konfliktlösung zu fördern, die einen Konflikt beenden würde, der schon jetzt
viel zu viele Leben gekostet hat.

Mi chiamo Usumain (Ismail) Baraka. Ho
bisogno del tuo sostegno per finanziare i miei studi. Il mio sogno è poter studiare
politica internazionale, diplomazia e diritto per contribuire alla risoluzione
di conflitti e situazioni di crisi. Questa è la mia storia:

Sono nato nel 1994 a Dirhata, un piccolo
villaggio nel Darfur, nella parte occidentale del Sudan. Nel 2003,
quando le milizie degli Janjaweed sono arrivate al mio villaggio per uccidere
tutti gli uomini e i bambini maschi, avevo nove anni. Mio padre e mio fratello maggiore
sono stati uccisi a fucilate. Mia mamma mi ha fatto indossare i vestiti delle
mie sorelle, facendomi passare per una bambina. Così mi sono salvato. I
miliziani l’hanno colpita e colpita, chiedendole dove fossero i suoi altri
figli, ma lei ha insistito che le erano rimaste solo bambine. I miliziani ci
hanno chiusi nella nostra casa di legno e le hanno dato fuoco, aspettando fuori
dalla porta per essere sicuri che nessuno sopravvivesse. Mia mamma ci ha detto
di piangere e gridare. In questo modo i miliziani hanno creduto che stessimo
morendo e se ne sono andati. Mia mamma ha aperto uno squarcio nel legno, siamo
scappati dalla casa in fiamme e abbiamo abbandonato il villaggio alle nostre
spalle. Fuggendo per i campi, abbiamo trovato il corpo di mio padre e dopo
qualche metro, quello di mio fratello. Siamo arrivati a un campo profughi
dell’ONU nel Chad, dove abbiamo vissuto insieme fino al 2007. A quel punto non
ce l’ho più fatta a vivere nelle condizioni disumane del campo. Invece di
tornare al mio villaggio e combattere, volevo studiare.

Allora ho capito che l’unica speranza di tornare
un giorno nel mio paese con i miei cari fosse studiare, sforzarsi di capire la
situazione politica e la sua evoluzione, cercare di trovare soluzioni non
violente per aiutare a risolvere i conflitti in corso e contribuire a costruire
la pace. 
Quando ho lasciato il campo profughi,
mettendomi in viaggio da solo e lasciando dietro di me i miei cari, avevo solo tredici anni. 

Ho attraversato il Chad e sono arrivato in
Libia. Nella città di Bengasi ho iniziato a studiare l'inglese e a lavorare in
una piccola bottega, guadagnandomi così da vivere. Dopo un anno e mezzo mi sono
spostato con un amico in Egitto, dove ci avevano detto che avremmo potuto
studiare e gli studi non sarebbero stati troppo costosi. Ma il governo egiziano
stava collaborando con quello sudanese e rimandava i profughi del Darfur in Sudan, dove ci aspettava o imprigionamento a vita e tortura o la
morte. Dovevo lasciare l’Egitto. 
Un giorno ho visto in televisione un documentario
sulla Shoah, l’olocausto
ebraico. L’unica cosa che sapevo del popolo ebraico era che Israele è l’unico
stato ebraico nel mondo. Guardando il documentario, sono venuto a conoscenza
per la prima volta della storia degli ebrei, della liberazione dalla
schiavitù in Egitto raccontata nella Bibbia, delle persecuzioni e
discriminazioni sofferte nei secoli, fino alla fondazione dello stato ebraico,
dove gli ebrei possono vivere in libertà. Ho sentito un forte senso di
identificazione con la storia del popolo ebraico e non ho avuto dubbi che gli
israeliani avrebbero solidarizzato con la mia storia e la storia del mio
popolo: ho deciso che dovevo andare in Israele.

Sono entrato in contatto con un trafficante di migranti che
faceva la spola fino al confine con Israele. Eravamo dodici persone, tra cui io
e il mio amico. Nella notte, ci siamo avvicinati al confine israeliano
strisciando e abbiamo cercato di evitare i soldati egiziani con l’aiuto del
buio. Improvvisamente, qualcuno nel gruppo ha avuto un attacco di panico, è
saltato in piedi e ha iniziato a gridare. Tre pallottole nella testa, sparate
dai soldati, lo hanno ucciso sul posto. I soldati hanno quindi iniziato a
venire nella nostra direzione. Non avevamo altra scelta che correre verso la
recinsione del confine israeliano e sperare che le pallottole non ci colpissero.
Abbiamo gettato tutto quello che avevamo con noi e abbiamo corso, corso,
corso. Io e il mio amico abbiamo corso veloce quanto potevamo, tenendoci per
mano. Un altro uomo del gruppo è stato colpito a morte, e con lui il suo
amico che era tornato indietro per aiutarlo. Siamo riusciti a raggiungere la
recinsione di filo spinato e a scavalcarla. I soldati israeliani ci sono venuti
incontro, ci hanno dato acqua e hanno curato le nostre ferite.
Sono stato portato in una prigione, dove sono rimasto un
mese e mezzo nel settore degli adulti. Quando sono stato rilasciato, mi hanno
dato un visto temporaneo. Sono andato a Tel Aviv, dove ho vissuto in grande
incertezza. Ma anche lì sono riuscito a continuare a studiare inglese. Nel 2010
sono stato accolto a Yemin Orde, un villaggio che ospita giovani migranti e
rifugiati, fornendo loro un posto dove vivere e la possibilità di studiare.
Mi sono sentito al sicuro per la prima volta da quando sono arrivato in
Israele. Ho studiato l’ebraico e fatto il liceo nel villaggio di accoglienza.
Nel 2014 ho fatto la maturità. Da allora, faccio volontariato nel
villaggio, cercando di dare indietro qualcosa di quello che mi è stato donato
così generosamente.
Adesso vorrei poter studiare all’università.
Qui in Israele sono stato accettato in due istituzioni accademiche con facoltà a
numero chiuso: la prestigiosa “Lauder School of Government, Diplomacy and Strategy at the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya” e il corso di laurea triennale
“Politics and Government at the Tel Aviv-Yafo Academy”. Tutte e due i corsi di studio sono molto costosi,
perché il sistema universitario israeliano funziona come quello americano.
Nella mia situazione attuale non posso lasciare Israele, in quanto ho solo un
visto temporaneo che potrebbe essere revocato in ogni momento se non fosse per
la protezione che il villaggio Yemin Orde mi garantisce. Al momento non ho
quindi la possibilità di andare a studiare da un’altra parte.
Studiare è il motivo per cui ho lasciato il
campo profughi in Chad. Nonostante tutte le difficoltà che ho dovuto affrontare
da allora, non ho mai dimenticato il mio sogno. 
Ho studiato duramente per ottenere buoni
voti al liceo, e il fatto di essere stato accettato in queste due istituzioni
accademiche di alto livello è il frutto di merito, impegno e intenso lavoro. Il
mio più grande desiderio è avere la possibilità di studiare e poter ottenere
una laurea in scienze politiche e relazioni internazionali. Voglio tornare al
mio paese e aiutare la mia gente a vivere in pace nella loro terra. Voglio
costruire un ponte tra la mia prima casa, l’Africa, e la mia seconda casa,
Israele – il paese del popolo che sono ancora convinto può indentificarsi
meglio di chiunque altro con la mia situazione, dal momento che il popolo di
Israele ha vissuto esattamente la mia stessa tragica e dolorosa esperienza.

Mentre cerco di realizzare il mio scopo, preparandomi a
studiare all’università, non dimentico i miei fratelli e sorelle che hanno
dovuto attraversare lo stesso inferno che ho conosciuto anch’io. Come ho fatto
fino ad ora, continuo ad aiutare altri rifugiati che vivono in Israele e vanno
incontro a mille difficoltà, e continuo a visitare le persone incarcerate nel
campi di detenzione per rifugiati. Non dimentico neanche il villaggio
d’accoglienza per giovani che mi ha dato la possibilità di vivere serenamente e
studiare. Un altro dei miei compiti settimanali è il volontariato nelle
strutture del villaggio.

L’unica cosa che mi separa dalla mia laurea triennale non
è la voglia, la determinazione e la capacità di studiare e lavorare sodo, ma
sono le tasse universitarie estremamente onerose. 
Ti sarei infitamente grato – di una gratitudine più
profonda di ogni parola – se potessi aiutarmi nell’impresa di raccogliere fondi
per i miei studi, così che io possa raggiungere lo scopo che mi sono prefisso,
possa laurearmi e aiutare in maniera pacifica a risolvere conflitti che sono costati già troppe vite.",24.0,0,"2 Campaigns

My name is Jeff Picca. I have been a NYC public school teacher for 13 years and a Model U.N. coordinator for 12.

This program exposes them to geopolitical problem solving, helps develop their public speaking skills as well as gain confidence in their abilities as students.
Your generous donations will allow students to attend conferences at the University of Virginia, Harvard and the George Washington University.

   What We Need & What You Get  
We are hoping to raise $12,000.00 to in order to attend the 3 conferences this year.
We need to cover the costs of transportation and boarding for students whose parents do not have the funds to have their sons/daughters participate. Any donation will receive a personal letter from one of the students you helped send to a conference.  All funds will be used to cover the above mentioned expenses. It averages around $300 per student per conference. We have over 45 students and hope to divide the funds so that each student can attend 1 conference.

  The Impact
Participating in Model U.N.

<p>The Poetry Game has been printed, look beautiful. You can still order here!</p>
<h3><strong>Poetry Game Overview</strong></h3>
<p>The Poetry Game makes a perfect gift and an interactive game for ages 10-adult. It's a beautifully designed deck of cards, complete with instructions, and a lovely box. Our basic game is played in English. We now have Arabic, Yiddish, and Spanish versions. You don't need to know the language to play -- you learn as you go. The game can be played at home, with faith communities, in classes, and where ever you want to have fun and be creative with friends. </p>
<p>The game makes it easy and enjoyable to write poems, no matter your level of experience -- from ""never wrote a poem before"" to published poet. It builds community as well-- play and break the ice with people you don’t know or get to know friends and family on a deeper level.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>Update: </i> The initial campaign enabled us to design and print our cards. We have versions in English, Yiddish and Arabic, and a new Spanish version, You can still use this campaign to buy decks of Poetry Game cards. or to make a donation. Donations help us offer workshops in schools, senior centers, and faith communities. </p>
<p>The Poetry Game  promotes the preservation of culture and language. When you play the Spanish, Yiddish or Arabic versions of the game, you learn new words and cultural concepts, and integrate these words and ideas into poems. No prior knowledge of either language is needed to play, but it can also be used by fluent speakers or language learners.</p>
<p>It’s a perfect gift for:</p>

<h3><strong>Our Story</strong></h3>
<p>The roots for the Poetry Game began spontaneously at a dinner party that was hosted by Zahara Heckscher. Zahara's students at the University of Maryland, College Park decided to turn the game into a physical deck of cards. Since then, the game has been revised to feature a sleeker design and updated instruction cards! Zahara and her team have workshopped the new version of The Poetry Game in community centers and schools around D.C. and have been met with high levels of interest and enthusiasm. </p>

record from beginning to end.  My process begins with coming up with a
great idea and funding it (that’s why I here today).  I will sing, arrange,
produce, and executive produce a song I wrote.  However, instead of asking
for your donations, I want to offer you ownership shares in my project.  This fundraising will not only  help me pay for this project, it will really

sell 50% (or $1,000) to the general public.  I plan to give a 1.25% interest of the song to those who contribute every $25 (1 share) to my project. 
That means for a $100 contribution, you will retain a 5% interest in my
song which means you will receive 5% of the net income generated from the

<p>Hi Guys, this is Patrick from <a href=""http://trichocereus.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Trichocereus.net</a> and the <a href=""http://facebook.com/groups/trichocereus"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Trichocereus Facebook Group</a>! If you are involved in the Trichocereus Community, you probably heard that I was working on a book  about Trichocereus pachanoi and other related species from the San Pedro Group for a couple years now. Well, time flies and I am happy to announce that this book is finally getting close to a release date. </p>
<p>I been a cactus grower &amp; enthusiast for at least 20 years. I spent most of my adult life studying the Genus Trichocereus and this book is the result of my (still ongoing) work in this particular field. The book is called TRICHOCEREUS: THE SAN PEDRO GROUP and contains hundreds of photos as well as information about the botany of the San Pedro Group. The book will published in May or June 2016 and consists of more than 300 pages filled up with cool stuff and photos taken by me, friends or well known faces in the Trichocereus Growers community! <br/><b>Our Facebook Group with almost 3000 members</b> helped to support this project like a wall and I am extremely proud that I was given the chance to write and publish it now! </p>
<p>When I announced that there will be a printed edition of my book, I was overwhelmed with messages and mails from people who wanted to pre-order it that very day. But since this book will have a lot of all-color pages, the printing costs exceeded my funds by far.  <br/>And that´s where this crowdfunding campaign comes into play. <br/>With this campaign, I want to raise enough money to print enough copies for all the people who been looking forward to this project for months. The more money I will raise, the more books I will print. <br/> With that said; there will only be a very limited number of books available and I expect them to sell out fast. There will be 250 books available for everyone who supports this project with an amount of at least 58 Euro. There also are other perks for people who just want to support this project without buying a book as well as a high quality Hardcover Connoisseur Edition that is a little bit more expensive. </p>
<p><b>Here are some specifics about the book</b>: <br/></p>
<p> TRICHOCEREUS: THE SAN PEDRO GROUP contains over 300 all-color pages and hundreds of photos showing plants, flowers and fruits. <br/>This book is all about the botany and taxonomy of the San Pedro cactus and its relatives. It includes classic descriptions as well as new information about Trichocereus pachanoi &amp; its related species like Trichocereus bridgesii, Trichocereus scopulicola, Trichocereus peruvianus or some of the rather unofficial names like Trichocereus huanucoensis or the commercial variety Tom Juuls Giant. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. There are Latin descriptions that I dug out from 100 year old books, macro photos showing flowers and fruits and a practical chapter about the care of this great group of plants! In addition I share some in-depth information about raising Trichocereus plants from seeds and how to germinate them right!</p>
<p></p>
<p>                               <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457354652/dzksmms18jnng1hk0ijp.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 366.667px;height: 550px;""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This book is extra large (A4) and will be printed on high quality color paper. In my opinion, it´s extremely important that the cactus pics look great. And that´s why I am going for a more expensive printing method. I could release this book as a black &amp; white book for a very low price and make a lot more money, but I am a perfectionist and willing to pay a higher price for high quality color paper to make sure everything looks perfect. This is better than a coffee-table book about coffee-tables. <br/></p>
<p>Though I am the author, a lot of my friends were involved in this project and donated some really rare photos for this book! There literally are hundreds of pics showing the San Pedro Cacti in the habitats, including breathtaking shots of ancient Peruvian landscapes and Herbarium specimens. I collected all kinds of photos from Peru (Chavin, Cusco, Matucana etc), Bolivia, Chile and other South American countries. There even are photos of San Pedros from countries like Chile and Brasil, where this species is not as common as it is in Peru. Last but not least I included a chapter about mutants and cristates that will blow you away. <br/><br/>Some of those photos are exclusively available in this book and will NOT be published anywhere else. THE SAN PEDRO GROUP offers a complete overview about the species and includes photos from habitats, botanic gardens and collections worldwide!<br/><br/><b>And that´s why you will totally love this book, so please support this campaign to claim your copy now! </b>I will make sure that TRICHOCEREUS: THE SAN PEDRO GROUP will be one of the most beautiful coffee-table books you have in your shelf! Simple as that. You can support this project by making a safe Paypal payment and I will send you the book as soon as I get it from the book printing company. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>This is what I´ll do with the money:<br/>
</h3>All the money raised by this campaign will go directly into funding the printing of my book. The books you buy through this campaign will be numbered and signed.<br/>The printing costs will be somewhere between 10.000 - 12.000 Euro and there is not a doubt in my mind that we will get this book funded. The only question is if there are enough books for everyone who wants one. This project already has a long list of supporters in our Trichocereus Facebook Group and if you want to claim your copy now, this crowdfunding campaign is the safest way. If this campaign exceeds the goal, I will put the money into printing more books. <br/><br/>
</div><div>
<h3>What you will get by supporting this project:<br/>
</h3>By supporting my campaign with at least 58 Euro, you will get a copy of the<b> 1st Crowdfunding Edition</b> of this book for a reduced price of 58 Euro per book (plus the shipping costs). The regular price will be 68 Euro (plus the shipping costs). There will only be 250 books available here, so do not wait too long to order. <br/>There will also be a Hardcover Deluxe Edition for everyone who loves to own a high quality book and is willing to pay a little bit more for it. You can read more about the different versions in the chapter about the Perks. <ul>?<li>Everyone that supports this campaign by paying 58 Euro will get a copy of the softcover edition. This book is printed in color and on high quality paper. As soon as I have the printed books at home, I  will get in touch with the supporters and arrange for the shipping. The shipping costs are probably 12 Euro, but it also depends on where the buyer is located. In case the shipping costs exceed what I calculated, I´ll get in touch with the buyer to arrange for the shipping. </li>?<li>If this campaign won´t reach its goal, the number of printed books will go down and there won´t be any more books left for anyone outside of this campaign. I will try to print as many books as I can to make sure that all the supporters will get a copy. But this campaign is the only way to make sure that you´ll definitely get this book. <br/>I will try to get the books printed for a cheaper price if the campaign does not succeed, but I would have to use mediocre quality paper and colors, which really is a worst-case scenario.<br/><p><br/></p>

</h3>?
<p><b>1. Physical book: The Crowdfunding Edition (Softcover) - 58 Euro<br/></b></p>
<p>This is the most economic way to own this nice book. Not only will you get a printed copy of this limited book, but you´ll also get it for a reduced price of <b>58,00 Euro (plus shipping costs)</b>. The standard price of this book would be 68 Euro, but thanks to this campaign you can get it for a reduced price directly from the author. <br/><br/>There will only be <b>250 books</b> available and I am not sure whether or not there will be any more outside the crowdfunding campaign.

<p><b>2. <b>Physical book: </b>The Crowdfunding Connoisseur Edition (Hardcover)- 88 Euro</b><br/></p>
<p>This package contains a hardcover copy of the book for <b>88,00 Euro (plus shipping costs)</b>. Unlike the Softcover edition, the books from the CONNOISSEUR EDITION will be made using the thread stitching technique and all the pages will be printed on special paper to increase the brilliance of the photos. Believe me when I say that this will be a wonderful book that you will not want to give away again! The Hardcover Edition is not as affordable as the Softcover edition, but it´s definitely worth the price. It would be a lot cheaper to just print some more softcover books, but I
 felt like there should be a hardcover edition for the collectors who take pride in owning beautiful books. <br/>There will only be <b>30 hardcover books </b>produced and every book is numbered, labeled and signed as a way to thank you for your support! </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>3. Join the Trichocereus Movement - 10 Euro</b></p>This perk is for everyone who does not want to buy the book, but wants to support this project somehow! We appreciate every donation this project gets, because it will bring us close to our goal to make this book available.<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>4. Become a supporter - 30 Euro</b></p>
<p>Become part of the Trichocereus Movement and support our book project with 30 Euro. The money goes directly into the production of TRICHOCEREUS: THE SAN PEDRO GROUP and you will be listed as an official supporter in the publishing information of the book! Without the help of supporters, this project would not be possible and I am happy for everyone that I can add to this list! </p>
<p><b>5. Group Buy Pack (5 copies) <br/>285 Euro</b></p>
<p>If you want to make a group buy, this pack with five copies of TRICHOCEREUS: THE SAN PEDRO GROUP (Softcover edition) is the best way to go. You get those books for a massively reduced price and are among the first people who have this beautiful book in their hands!<br/></p>
<p><b>6. Reseller Package (10 copies) 550 Euro</b><br/></p>
<p>If you want to sell the book in your shop, you´ll get ten books of TRICHOCEREUS: THE SAN PEDRO GROUP (Softcover edition) for a reduced price. Or share the books with your family &amp; friends. I will also sign the copies as a way to say thank you for your support and include some of my SAN PEDRO GROUP stickers.<br/></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;line-height: 30px;background-color: initial;"">Risks and potential problems:</span></p>
</div><div>The biggest risk is that the campaign does not reach its goal. With that said, this campaign uses a fexible option that allows me to get the collected money even if it does not reach the goal. But that would mean that that I had to dramatically reduce the quality of the printing and the colors, which I really don´t want to do. Apart from that, have no doubt that we will get this project funded. <br/><b>If you want to get this book in the best possible quality, now is the time to buy it! </b>Indiegogo is a very reliable crowd funding company and you can securely pay with Paypal. </div><div>Another problem that authors sometimes face is that they get a printed product that does not meet the expectations. But due to the fact that I will print this book in Germany, I can make use of my legal warranties if I am not entirely happy with the quality of the printing. That´s actually the reason why I do not want to go for a cheaper printing company in China and will instead produce this book in Germany. That gives me some legal options that guarantee that I will get the high quality that I pay for. And on top of that, I will also get an advance copy in order to prevent a lot of tears later on. </div><div>Apart from that, there is the risk that I am hit by a meteorite or a school bus. You know, life is full of risks and you never know what happens tomorrow. <br/>But even though that would be extremely bad news for me, I still made arrangements to get my book printed in case of a worst case scenario. <br/>
</div><div>Please expect the shipping phase to last at least 4-8 weeks because I am sure there will be a lot of books that need to be shipped out in a relatively short time. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me at any time. <br/>??<br/><h3>Some more ways to support this project:<br/>

But due to the fact that I will print this book in Germany, I can make use of my legal warranties if I am not entirely happy with the quality of the printing. That´s actually the reason why I do not want to go for a cheaper printing company in China and will instead produce this book in Germany. That gives me some legal options that guarantee that I will get the high quality that I pay for. And on top of that, I will also get an advance copy in order to prevent a lot of tears later on. Apart from that, there is the risk that I am hit by a meteorite or a school bus. You know, life is full of risks and you never know what happens tomorrow. But even though that would be extremely bad news for me, I still made arrangements to get my book printed in case of a worst case scenario. 
Please expect the shipping phase to last at least 4-8 weeks because I am sure there will be a lot of books that need to be shipped out in a relatively short time. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me at any time. ??Some more ways to support this project:
If it should not be possible for you to buy a copy due to whatever reasons, you can still help this project by talking about this project or sharing the link. There were many times when I was WAY too broke to afford all the cool cactus books that I wanted and I definitely know how that feels, So if there are things that keep you from buying, you are wholeheartedly invited to let your friends know about it! I appreciate every share that this page will get as long as you don´t spam! You can also use the INDIEGOGO sharing tool in order to tell others about this project.

creativity, and teaching future generations how to draw the world through the

drawing siblings of cancer patients, kids at a local school, and have plans to

I’m Daniel Cape and I LOVE drawing caricatures,
traveling the world, and making a positive impact in the lives of kids; and
right now my goal is to accomplish all three at the same time, but I need YOUR support! Go grab yourself a cool glass of ice tea and a handful of M&M’s, put
on some upbeat music, find yourself a comfy chair, and sit back and let me tell
you about my dream.First, let’s start at the beginning…When I was around 12
years old, my dad got me a book on how to draw caricatures because I liked
drawing cartoons. It was a dumb idea, I mean horrible, what was he thinking?
Anyway, about 10 years after that I started drawing caricatures of people I
worked with, and have LOVED it ever since. *You got me there dad. Since then, I’ve worked at
Universal Studios in Hollywood, the Stratosphere in Las Vegas, fairs, parties, and
now run my own booth at Silverwood Theme Park in Athol, Idaho. One of my dreams
has been to travel the world and draw caricatures of people. I’ve already done it to
some extent, drawing people in Belize, Guatemala, Ukraine, and Japan, just for
fun. But what if I could do it with a cause? Guess what, I AM!!My goal is to start a non-profit that would allow me, and
other artists, to travel the US and the WORLD drawing caricatures, inspiring
creativity, and teaching future generations how to draw the world through the
art of caricatures. I’ve already started right here in my area by
drawing siblings of cancer patients, kids at a local school, and have plans to
draw and teach at several other locations in the next few weeks. This is only the beginning. My target population is
children who could use a little extra support in life, and man is there a ready
supply of them around the world, sadly enough. Okay, so how can you help, you ask….well, my dad gave me a
book on how to draw caricatures, not a million dollar loan. Right now I’m a
student, working on my PhD in Psychology with a focus in Creativity Studies.
Needless to say, I could use some financial assistance in making this dream
come true. This is just to get it started. Here’s a list of supplies I’ll need and what they cost, so that you
know where your money is going…*All donations are tax deductible!

revolutionized how the Portuguese talked about and understood sexuality. Since
then she has been invited to do lectures, workshops and conferences in schools,
associations, universities, companies and even religious groups. She has
presented additional TV shows such as <i>Aqui há sexo</i> and <i>100
tabus</i>. She has written books about sexuality and continues to be an opinion
maker through articles and chronicles she writes for newspapers and magazines.</b></p>

</div></div>","Creating the Pedagogical and Interactive Museum of Sexuality( Sex&), was an inevitability. Once a dream, Sex& is now a global challenge, born from its mentor’s concern and desire to evolve the paradigm of sexuality, harnessing its universal constructive energy to bring people together, promote health and psychological well-being, and framing it as one of the pillars of the GNH (Gross National Happiness) index.



Criar o Museu Pedagógico e Interactivo da Sexualidade (Sex&) tornou-se uma inevitabilidade. Mais do que um sonho, mais do que um
desafio mundial, o Sex& nasce da inquietação e vontade da mentora de
querer mudar o paradigma da sexualidade, pois considera-a como uma fonte
de energia universal que aproxima as pessoas, que promove a saúde e o bem-estar

We all deserve to be sexually happy and be guaranteed universal sexual and reproductive freedom, a fundamental part of human rights, to live unfettered by prejudice, discrimination, disease, guilt and violence.
Especially for all women

Todos merecemos ser felizes sexualmente e para isso é necessário garantir os
direitos sexuais e reprodutivos universais, uma componente fundamental dos
direitos humanos,  e  devemos viver livres de preconceitos,
discriminação, doenças, culpa ou violência.
Principalmente, para todas as mulheres

The future museum promotes knowledge and understanding of human sexuality, focused on education through artistic expression and novel, pedagogical interactive contents. 

Através do futuro Museu pretende-se promover o conhecimento e a reflexão
sobre a sexualidade humana, numa perspectiva educativa, através de expressões
artísticas e de conteúdos inovadores e interativos.

Marta Crawford
Marta Crawford is a renowned Portuguese psychologist,
sexologist and family therapist who in 2005 surged in notoriety when she
addressed sexuality in a direct, simple and positive manner in the TV
show ABSEXO. Taking the country by surprise, she
revolutionized how the Portuguese talked about and understood sexuality. Since
then she has been invited to do lectures, workshops and conferences in schools,
associations, universities, companies and even religious groups. She has
presented additional TV shows such as Aqui há sexo and 100
tabus. She has written books about sexuality and continues to be an opinion
maker through articles and chronicles she writes for newspapers and magazines.
Marta Crawford

sexualidade de forma direta, simples e positiva no programa ABSEXO, que em
20O5 revolucionou a forma como os portugueses passaram a falar e a
entender a sexualidade. Desde então tem sido convidada para fazer
palestras, workshops e conferências em escolas, associações,
universidades, empresas e até associações religiosas. A sua experiência
como psicóloga, sexóloga e terapeuta
familiar tem sido reconhecida através da sua pratica clínica. Apresentou
novos programas na tv como Aqui há sexo e  100 tabus. Escreveu livros
sobre sexualidade e tornou-se leader de opinião através de artigos e

<p>Wolfi, my son, was only 18 months when our neighbor’s kid grew out of matchbox cars and brought over a pile of toy cars to add to our playroom. At the time, we didn’t have any tracks to play with, and Wolfi quickly figured out, you can’t do much with toy cars on the floor. So, I looked around the playroom for ideas to make the cars go, and thought of making my own tracks out of cardboard. I grabbed my cereal box, folded a little, cut a little and figured out how we could stick them to the wall to create some cool Trax!</p>
<p></p>

<p>We kept experimenting with the idea and developed Paper Trax. Being a Coast Guard family who moves around quite a bit, it was nice to have an exciting family project. My daughter Bailey, she’s 5, and she has the Trax really figured out. Bailey builds the Trax and sets them up on the wall and is able to see her creations come to life. Wolfi, at 3 years, he loves the Trax as well, and his favorite part is seeing the collision when several Trax cross! Wolfi says, “Kabamers!”</p>
<p>Thankfully, Paper Trax ended up being a wonderful toy for my kids and two years later my kids still play with the Trax just about every day.</p>
<p>We can’t wait to see your creations and what your family invents for Paper Trax! Paper Trax are fun for all ages, and even at the office. We would love to see some cubicles, waiting rooms and executive board rooms Trax'd out!</p>

Everyone deserves water. It should not be a luxury to have a clean glass of water to drink because you are thirsty or wash your hands. Will you please help us? We are thirsty....

<p>Our Little Wound School wrestling team has not had a home wrestling match since 2004 because of an unsafe wrestling mat. The mat has cracks, folds, and tears. It can cause severe injury or death due to compressed spots and head trauma.</p>
<p>Wrestling is an important sport to many students. ""Not everyone can play basketball and football"" says Chris Janis, wrestling coach for Little Wound School. </p>
<p>Students use athletics, and in this case, wrestling to motivate themselves to keep their grades up and stay fit. Obesity and diabetes is a pandemic on many Indian reservations in the United States. Native Americans are 2.2 times higher— Likelihood of American Indians and Alaska Natives to have diabetes compared with non-Hispanic whites. There was a 68% increase of diabetes from 1994 to 2004 among Native Americans (diabetes.org). Pine Ridge Indian Reservation is no exception. Often the rates are higher on Pine Ridge Indian Reservation than other places. An hour of exercise a day can also replace all psychiatric medications says some doctors. This is an important fact because Indian reservations face suicide rates of 3x higher than other comparable locations. </p>
<p>Exercise is a must and wherever a student finds happiness and the motivation to perform that exercise should be rewarded with what they deserve. In this case they deserve a new wrestling mat and the ability to care and store it. </p>

We had a chance to improve ourselves by undertaking the professional diploma in entrepreneurship and business application. While studying in this diplomas to learn about entrepreneurship, and to create our own work opportunity, we have crystallized our vision about entrepreneurship concept, and how we can build our ideas to become actual businesses. We then came up with an idea to give Gaza’s kids chance to think in creatively create innovative ideas, discover their hidden abilities and talents at an early age. We believe from our hearts that Gazan kids can do amazing things, despite the difficult lives they experience.Our project

Our project offers young
Gazan girls and boys aged 10-13 the opportunity to learn the principles of
entrepreneurship and self-employment skills and through a range of interactive
activities, formed as a mini-training
course with training materials, to teach them how to generate entrepreneurial ideas
and the basics to start their own business, building a plan and marketing it. 
Gaza kidpreneurs camp
gives kids the opportunity to get creative by teaching kids to start thinking
creatively, planning to their life, and own their own business in future from
an early age. We aim to spark the spirit of entrepreneurship for kids to set
goals, work hard, and achieve their dreams.
What make Gaza kidpreneurs camp valuable REALLY?

entrepreneurial roots and encourage them to become kidpreneurs.

Hopin Academy is the only initiative working with the youth in entrepreneurship currently in northern Ghana with a population of 1.5 million people. For five years now, our creative and innovative facility/space and resources can only host 15 young entrepreneurs for 6 to 8 months of training. We however we wish this campaign if successful would support us to increase our resources, space, tools and expertise to host and impact a 100 entrepreneurs each year  and other entrepreneurial learning events in the ecosystem/region to be able to start their own businesses, projects and also learn spacial skills which would empower them in finding jobs.  Please read more and follow us here: www.hopinacademy.org Contributors would help us achieve the following below.Hopin Academy would need an amount of 30,000 dollars of 50% of the amount to do the following below.To be able to operate a 3-6 month long skill training for 100 young people in improving their skills to access jobs and also in starting their own small businesses. To provide some sort of seed capital ( Money) to the graduate entrepreneur’s to test, pilot or implement their ideas after incubation ( Training of the entrepreneurs ) in Hopin Academy.To surround those entrepreneurs  with 10-20 successful mentors each year.During the training young people are sent as interns to projects or business of their interest to meet change makers who have succeeded in their projects/businesses, This step helps them to gain a first had experience from the real working field and sharpens their mindset.  To have funding for a two-year runway of the program while developing our model for sustainability for the continuation of working with young people many years after this funding for this project phases off.To have physical space available for the program. our current space for meetings and training  needs more tools, learning materials and room for young people to work from, this would help young entrepreneurs to access working space of their ideas while they are still starting up with no or less capital.  To have a strong management team who are typically proven entrepreneurs. We want to bring on board creative trainers as volunteers and team members to guide these young entrepreneurs.  A less amount from what we seek would still be used to kick start what we envision to do and in addition our own funds secured organically for the past years of operations.Hopin Academy would send a public appreciation with funder's profile and also through our newsletter and publications for your generous support with visuals and documentary of our new facility for entrepreneurs.  As Africa and most developing countries are working towards moving from poverty and harsh economic issues, this program is set to solve the very problem by helping young people to grow with the mindset of independence by creating sustainable businesses, projects and to solving problems through technology and innovation. This also falls within the SDGs asHopin Academy approach focus on creative education, Skill development, economic growth, job creation and decent work.     Hopin Academy has impact over 500 young people with modern skills to finding jobs since 2013.We have impacted 90 young people to start sustainable micro enterprise’s to solving their community problems and creative livelihood for them.We worked with the Ghanaian government to train 220 entrepreneurs and startups to access seed capital from the governmentwww.hopinacademy.org    We hope this campaign succeeds for a great impact We have a growing pressure of young entrepreneurs falling out of the program as our current facility and resources are not available to handle more than 15 passionate entrepreneurs in an ecosystem of 1.5 million.   The new facility however would equip Hopin Academy to admit 100 young entrepreneurs each year instead of 15. Before Hopin Academy decided to embark on this fundraising. We asked ourselves of success rate?. We said to ourselves. We believe in humanity across the globe. And we have given it a short.Support our project by donating to us using the link below and kindly keep sharing to family and friends, this would help us reach our goal, every cent matters in making a real change.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Hi there! My name is Emma, and I'm in eighth grade. This year we are studying American History, and my history teacher is offering this amazing opportunity to go to Boston and New York over spring break to actually visit some of the historic places we will be learning about. These places include where the Salem Witch Trials took place, the Boston Harbor, where nearly 600,000 pounds of tea were dumped in 1773, Ellis Island, where thousands of immigrants arrived, and countless
other things. We also get to go to Fenway Park, Yankee Stadium, Radio City Music
Hall, Harvard, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, and so many more fun places. I also found out we will get to go to the Tenement Museum which I am SUPER excited about. You have to book that at least 10 months in advance! We
get to stay for three nights in each city! I know it will be the most amazing trip ever.
The one problem: the cost. Unfortunately, my family doesn't have the kind of
money that will send me on the trip, and my parents were clear that I can't go unless I find the
money elsewhere.</p>
<p></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I feel like this trip will really impact my history experience this year. It's so different being able to actually see something up close that you're learning about in the classroom than just reading about it. To walk where the American Revolution took place. To experience what it was like to live in the tenements. To feel the water that the members of the Boston Tea Party felt. I'm sooo excited!!!!! Plus, since I'm not going to be with my parents for an entire week, I think I will mature greatly.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>So, I need $2,800. Ouch. This will cover round-trip airfare, six nights at hotels, breakfast, lunch, dinner, transportation, entry fees to all the places we will be going, and the perks you get for donating. Keep reading to find out what those are! :D</p>

We also competed at the Boilermaker Regional at Purdue University against 40 other teams.  We fought with 3 Alliance partners and emerged victorious at both regional competitions. By winning these Regional Competitions, we have qualified for the World Championship in St. Louis, MO.Check out the Highlights from the Regional here: What We Need & What You GetTo accept this honor, and go to the World Championship, we must be able to pay for registration, transportation, and to stay in St. Louis for the Weekend. The Team this year is comprised of 24 students as well as almost 10 Mentors. In order to pay for this many people to attend this competition, we calculated the cost at $20,000. Going to the World Championship would be a great honor for many students, who have put in many hours to the project. If you contribute, we will represent you or your business at the World Championship. Either on our team T-shirts or on the robot itself. We always are grateful of our Donors and sponsors, and want to honor them at our competition, for the world to see. In the case that we do not reach our entire goal, we will either make up the difference with other grants and local sponsors, or in the case that we cannot go, the money will help fund the robotics program next year, and allow us to compete successfully next year.The ImpactThe First Robotics Competition is an international program that promotes engineering and Gracious Professionalism in both the community and within the teams. Students this year had 6 Weeks to design, build and Program their robot to accomplish the game Aerial Assist. The Students put in many hours to get this done, and have completed our robot. Our team has high hopes of attending the World Championship. Going and competing at the World Level would be the goal of the team, and, given our success at the regional competitions, we believe that we could do very well given the chance to compete. Penn Robotics has been successful in attending the World Championship many years in its long history, and we would like to continue this long tradition this year.If you want to see the game this year, a link can be found here:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zWzICG5toOther Ways You Can HelpIf you cannot assist us financially, Please share the cause with others. If you cannot contribute to our team, we love other First Robotics Teams to have support. There are many teams throughout the country, and they always could use both motivational support as well as volunteer help. We encourage the community to help other teams around the world, and allow them to be successful.",0.0,1,"3 Campaigns

engineers and problem solvers when I gave them reusable materials for creating. We
learned lots of innovative techniques together. </p>
<p>Creative reuse is a great way
to reduce waste and create art at a lower cost. 
Using materials found around the home and office, children can create

levels of innovation and creativity and is something the children can easily
practice on their own time. </p>
<p>DC CRAFT will be a free one-day
event held in collaboration with local arts, education, environmental, and

<p><strong>What We Do</strong></p>
<p>18 months ago, Laurel and David launched <a href=""http://www.voicescienceworks.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.voicescienceworks.org</a> as a free online resource for all voice lovers. Today the site has over<strong> 30 free tutorial pages</strong> and draws <strong>20,000+ visitors a week. </strong>Along with the free information offered on the site we also provide group workshops, one on one lessons, vocal ensemble retreats, educational webinars and performances as vocal artists.</p>
<p>The information on the site draws on research from the fields of Vocal Performing Arts, Logopedics, Speech and Hearing Science, Audiology, Neurology, Laryngology, and Otology, and relies on knowledge of vocal anatomy, physiology, biomechanics, perceptual-motor learning principles, acoustics, the physics of sound, and vocal pedagogy and practice. What does that boil down to? <strong>The nitty gritty of how we make sound and how we teach people to make the sounds they want to make.</strong></p>
<p>Because all of this information in it’s raw form can often feel alienating and uninviting, the goal of our website is to translate the important parts into bite-size bits. <strong>VoiceScienceWorks is place where science can be fun, beautiful, communicative, and accessible to all.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What We Want to Do</strong></p>
<p>To date, all of our work has been a gift to the voice community. But now the demand for what we’re offering has grown into a small business. We want to move at a quicker pace, add more complete information to the website and add more people to our team.</p>
<p>Our first fundraising goal is to raise $10,000 to launch the following projects in the next 6 months:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create and share 15 more free content pages with original clarifying images  (including free tutorials on vowel perception, vocal registers, singingin multiple styles, vibrato, and the science of hearing)</li>
<li>Create and share a brand new online course introducing how you, too, can play with voice analyzer software</li>
<li>Create and share 5 educational videos, the beginning of VoiceScienceWorks video series</li>
<li>Create and share the first season of our new podcast Translation Station: From Science to Pedagogy</li>
<li>Create and share our second online publication The Unfiltred Source: an eZine for the Communal Voice Lover</li>
<li>Begin production on our first book: The Smart Singer’s Revolution</li>
<li>Add a member to our team to help update references, courses, conferences and resources on the site</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why it's Important</strong></p>
<p>The voice is an instrument we all share, we’re all curious about, and yet most people feel alienated from. The voice is the most expressive and diverse instrument on the planet. The voice tells you how you are and who you are and every emotion you have passes through your voice. Because it is an instrument that can’t be directly seen, touched, or controlled, most voice users face frustration and confusion when learning how to make the sounds they want to make.</p>
<p>We have heard feedback from beginning voice users, professional singers, voice teachers, choir directors, speech therapists, university professors, researchers, actors, and composers that the information and resources on our website provides tools that they can immediately start working with, empowers their learning process, and helps them narrow down other confusing information they might come across.</p>
<p>No other website is currently offering this unique information, and for free! We believe it is a right of all voice users to have access to information that is accurate, clarifying, empowering and adds joy to their vocal journeys.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Hello, we are a group of improvisers based in Bucharest, Romania. We play, teach and also live by art and improvisation. We’ve traveled the world and explored how improv and art changed people, communities, lives, and we’ve assumed the mission that we’ll bring this to “our people” by opening Recul Theatre and School.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recul School and Theatre needs a new place to grow and to help others grow.</strong> In the<strong> next three months</strong>, we have to move our entire activity from the rented house in which we’re in right now, to a newer, bigger, brighter home.</p>
<p>And for our family, as well as it is for every other family, a new home means: first of all a new rent, moving costs, improvement costs, furniture and new equipment.</p>
<p><strong>This is where YOU come in!</strong> We need your help to open the new Recul Theatre and School! By doing this you’ll be part of a movement that’s just starting, you’ll be able to get front row seats to our performances, special classes for you and your peeps, and some of you will get the chance to have a special part in our shows and theatre.</p>
<p>Also, you’ll be supporting a movement that can help our community grow and our society to prosper.</p>
<p>Discovering the world through the eyes of a performer at Recul means discovering the world through curiosity and not suspicion. In our country, we’re still struggling with the old mentality and this is affecting the new generation. Kids in schools don’t have the chance to explore their feelings, to be authentic and have courage. Through our classes, we can reach this potential and much more. By supporting us, with the classes that we’ll address to kids, you’ll be investing in them as well.</p>
<p>In the next three months while you’ll be spending a cozy Christmas (we hope), we’ll be creating, designing, wrapping, packing, moving, cleaning, painting and opening the new Recul School, a place of:</p>
<p><strong>Theatre:</strong> a new training and teaching place for performers in Romania and not only, an incubator for improv, theatre, sketch comedy and much more, a place where any group can train, discover and develop new art and shows, a network of teachers and a space for connecting  passionate people from Romania and all over the world.</p>
<p><strong>Intuitive Learning:</strong> a multidisciplinary curriculum with a core on improvisation and art as a method of teaching. Our teachers will open classes like: learn a foreign language through conversation and improv; discover the beauty of math through improv; boost your self-esteem through musical improv;</p>
<p><strong>But here’s the thing, we can’t open a school and a new theatre without you. And this is your unique chance to be part of a group that’s opening a school and a theatre. Here’s our plan:</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>We have three months to move everything that we have in the old Recul Theatre, find a new place that can host the theatre and Recul School.</strong></p>
<p>We’ll be moving in a new place downtown Bucharest with easy access from anywhere<strong> (in the world - all roads will lead to Recul).</strong></p>
<p><strong>We’ll rent a house that has the following details:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recul Theatre:</strong> A performance room big enough, <strong>around 115 square meters</strong>,  where we can build 60 seats for the audience, build a stage, lights &amp; sounds equipped and ready for magical improv shows.</p>
<p><strong>Recul School:</strong> <strong>Four separate rooms, </strong>not as big as the performance room but around 20 square meters, in the house where, yes, you guessed it, magic will happen. It’s where we’ll create the space for improvisation classes and intuitive learning.</p>
<p><strong>Bar space</strong>: an extra room,<strong> 65 square meters</strong>, and terrace, for all the geeky improv talks before and after the shows.</p>
<p>For all our wishes above, the rent, downtown Bucharest, is around 2500 Euros/month (for all the Eastern Europe people, this should sound about high, for other more advanced countries where this rent might seem low, you have to imagine that the minimum monthly wage for the 8hours work day in Romania is around 300 Euros)....yes… we know, 2500 Euros/month is a big deal in this case and this is just rent.</p>
<p><strong>But hey, we’re improvisers and we’re sure you guys will have our back.</strong></p>
<p>And because you’ll do that, we generously prepared some special perks for you. We’re very excited about the limited ones such as:</p>
<p><strong>The cultural remedy kit: </strong>a special magic box that contains natural cultural remedies for every sign of ache caused by the lack of art in your life.</p>
<p><strong>Special limited edition merchandise</strong>: we prepared a special line of T-shirts, handmade objects, posters.</p>
<p><strong>Guaranteed presence in Recul Theatre</strong>: you’ll be here, with us, all the time. On the wall of fame dedicated to the supporters and on the list of “go to” names we’ll use in our improvised shows. Yes, you heard that right! If you decide to go for this perk we’ll give life to characters named after you in our improv shows.</p>

<p><font color=""red""><strong>The book is now publicly available, get it at <a href=""http://hdv470-7.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://hdv470-7.com</a></strong></font></p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2><strong>We’re publishing a German Army Regulation of 1941 about the Medium Tank Company (Mittlere Panzerkompanie)</strong></h2>
<p>The <i>H.Dv. 470/7 - Die mittlere Panzerkompanie</i> from May 1941 is a key Army regulation for the German Panzer force following the successful campaigns in Poland, the Low Countries and France. It encompasses topics such as tank crew specialization, training, formations, how to engage enemy positions and tanks, as well as a complete breakdown of the tank company’s force strength.</p>
<p>This book will feature the German original text side by side to the English translation to give you the most authentic historic reproduction of this document. The translation itself is kept as close and accurate to the original as possible, with additional remarks where necessary when the ‘military German’ from the 1940s provided a more ambiguous explanation than perhaps intended. Likewise, the formatting of the document will base itself on the original document.</p>
<p>During our research on this document, which we also conducted at the German Military Archive in Freiburg, we uncovered plenty of additional information that might prove of interest to you. These were also added to provide additional contextual information and clarifications where necessary, including a breakdown of the main Panzer variants used by the Germans during Operation Barbarossa. As always, a full range of sources is given.</p>
<p>As our collaborators on this project, Major Nicholas ""The Chieftain"" Moran (US Army Armor Branch) reviewed our translation. Equally, Dr. Roman Töppel, German Military Historian and Eastern Front expert reviewed our Glossary and summaries of the Panzer I to IV.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What You Get</strong></h3>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570012804/yy4kbi5cramlhsrv7yeh.png"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The English translation of the original text with annotations and a wide range of remarks for more information on content and the translation itself.</li>
<li>​The German text annotated with our remarks where necessary.</li>
<li>262 pages* of Panzer goodness.</li>
<li>A list of titles of all referenced Army &amp; Service regulations, since these are only mentioned by number in the original text.</li>
<li>A glossary of important German military terminologies with short explanation.</li>
<li>Visualization of the composition of a German Medium Tank Company from 1941.</li>
<li>List of equivalent ranks in the German, US and Red Army for officers, NCOs &amp; enlisted men.</li>
<li>Short summaries and technical data on the Panzer I to IV.</li>
<li>Of course, a bibliography.</li>
</ul>
<p>* Plus/Minus a few pages in the final edit.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Risks and Challenges</strong></h3>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570012816/m1bn4snw5vm96ufmbu4j.png"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p>While the text is sitting at 98% completion and we are ready to put the final stamp, certain challenges present themselves which we want to share with you.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is our first project of this nature. We have spent many hours and days planning this project since we started it in Spring 2019. During this time, we have gone over the document countless times to fix errors, provide a legible but authentic body and provide all additional information that a reader might find beneficial. The text has also gone through an editorial review. As with all things however, errors (for example in spelling) can creep into any piece of work. Likewise, the original formatting of the original will be kept, resulting in a handful of pages that look somewhat 'empty'.</li>
<li>Self-publishing this book is quite an undertaking. While we could go hands-off and just hand it over to a publisher, we don’t think this is the best solution for you or for us. The price would rise, the timetable would be pushed back many months and, in the end, we end up dependent on someone else. As such, we’ve tried to find the best way of self-publishing this book by printing the sold copies after the campaign ends (hopefully) successfully and shipping them out by a fulfillment center. This gives us extra work but ensures a fair price and hopefully a speedy arrival of your book (see ETA in the perks). We have done our homework and that is half the battle but, in all fairness, we are new to this which might mean that the unexpected or unforeseen might occur.</li>
<li>Due to our choice to self-publish, shipping anywhere outside the US is difficult as the shipping prices over the fulfillment center vary drastically. While we had initially limited orders due to only the US because of this, based on your feedback and demand we have now changed this with an extra perk offering paperback for EU countries, Switzerland and Norway. The price does vary from US-based orders (where our book is printed), as the books will be sent to the EU, and then manually shipped to all of you. Shipping is INCLUDED in the pledging price. For those of you that pledged for a signed copy before, you can still change this selection back to a simple paperback. Equally, for those of you that pledged for the EBook version, you can now also change to a paperback if you amend your order.</li>
<li>Privacy notice: Your shipping addresses will be processed by the fulfillment center and us.</li>
</ul>

We’re publishing a German Army Regulation of 1941 about the Medium Tank Company (Mittlere Panzerkompanie)
The H.Dv. 470/7 - Die mittlere Panzerkompanie from May 1941 is a key Army regulation for the German Panzer force following the successful campaigns in Poland, the Low Countries and France. It encompasses topics such as tank crew specialization, training, formations, how to engage enemy positions and tanks, as well as a complete breakdown of the tank company’s force strength.
This book will feature the German original text side by side to the English translation to give you the most authentic historic reproduction of this document. The translation itself is kept as close and accurate to the original as possible, with additional remarks where necessary when the ‘military German’ from the 1940s provided a more ambiguous explanation than perhaps intended. Likewise, the formatting of the document will base itself on the original document.
During our research on this document, which we also conducted at the German Military Archive in Freiburg, we uncovered plenty of additional information that might prove of interest to you. These were also added to provide additional contextual information and clarifications where necessary, including a breakdown of the main Panzer variants used by the Germans during Operation Barbarossa. As always, a full range of sources is given.
As our collaborators on this project, Major Nicholas ""The Chieftain"" Moran (US Army Armor Branch) reviewed our translation. Equally, Dr. Roman Töppel, German Military Historian and Eastern Front expert reviewed our Glossary and summaries of the Panzer I to IV.
 
What You Get


The English translation of the original text with annotations and a wide range of remarks for more information on content and the translation itself.
​The German text annotated with our remarks where necessary.
262 pages* of Panzer goodness.
A list of titles of all referenced Army & Service regulations, since these are only mentioned by number in the original text.
A glossary of important German military terminologies with short explanation.
Visualization of the composition of a German Medium Tank Company from 1941.
List of equivalent ranks in the German, US and Red Army for officers, NCOs & enlisted men.
Short summaries and technical data on the Panzer I to IV.
Of course, a bibliography.

* Plus/Minus a few pages in the final edit.
 
Risks and Challenges

While the text is sitting at 98% completion and we are ready to put the final stamp, certain challenges present themselves which we want to share with you.

This is our first project of this nature. We have spent many hours and days planning this project since we started it in Spring 2019. During this time, we have gone over the document countless times to fix errors, provide a legible but authentic body and provide all additional information that a reader might find beneficial. The text has also gone through an editorial review. As with all things however, errors (for example in spelling) can creep into any piece of work. Likewise, the original formatting of the original will be kept, resulting in a handful of pages that look somewhat 'empty'.
Self-publishing this book is quite an undertaking. While we could go hands-off and just hand it over to a publisher, we don’t think this is the best solution for you or for us. The price would rise, the timetable would be pushed back many months and, in the end, we end up dependent on someone else. As such, we’ve tried to find the best way of self-publishing this book by printing the sold copies after the campaign ends (hopefully) successfully and shipping them out by a fulfillment center. This gives us extra work but ensures a fair price and hopefully a speedy arrival of your book (see ETA in the perks). We have done our homework and that is half the battle but, in all fairness, we are new to this which might mean that the unexpected or unforeseen might occur.
Due to our choice to self-publish, shipping anywhere outside the US is difficult as the shipping prices over the fulfillment center vary drastically. While we had initially limited orders due to only the US because of this, based on your feedback and demand we have now changed this with an extra perk offering paperback for EU countries, Switzerland and Norway. The price does vary from US-based orders (where our book is printed), as the books will be sent to the EU, and then manually shipped to all of you. Shipping is INCLUDED in the pledging price. For those of you that pledged for a signed copy before, you can still change this selection back to a simple paperback. Equally, for those of you that pledged for the EBook version, you can now also change to a paperback if you amend your order.
Privacy notice: Your shipping addresses will be processed by the fulfillment center and us.

<p>Hi! We are Mie and Guillermo, we are both undergraduate students
reading Biology and Maths respectively. This summer we are volunteering for a
month in Yueyang, in Hunan province, China, where we will be teaching English
in a volunteer-run camp in Yueyang Sunny English Training school.</p>
<p>This will hopefully make a great impact on the kid's lives as
achieving a higher level of English enables them to aspire to better jobs,
widening their opportunities but also to enjoy and understand a culture
different from their own.</p>
<p>However, we would like to go a step further, and create a more
long-term impact for the learning center, which is noticeably low on resources.
It manages to go on due to the time and effort of volunteers, but it does not
have spare money to invest on teaching facilities. Thus, we aim to raise some
money that will be used in buying a pair of projectors and some other material,
such as books.</p>
<p>After this month we will be travelling to Vietnam and Cambodia,
places from which we wish to be able to offer our donors some interesting
perks!</p>
<p><b>What we need</b></p>
<p>The majority of the funds will be invested into the acquisition
of two new projectors in China, some material for teaching and English read for
teenagers.</p>
<p>A minor part of the funds will be diverted to the purpose of
documenting our journey and sharing our experience, specifically a camera
(nothing too fancy, probably a SJ4000, nothing above $100, just something to
capture the moments) and a small 10” laptop or chromebook (with a cost not
exceeding $250) to update our blog during the journey.</p>
<p><b>Perks</b></p>
<p>To make it less painful to give money away, we offer a series of
perks which we believe can be interesting:</p>
<p>Want to know first hand about the daily running of the camp and
the visions of the children about it? Receive a letter from a child, thanking
you for the donation and telling you about their experiences in the camp.</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered what the thoughts of a Chinese man about
polygamy would be? Or what does a Vietnamese sailor think about fish farms?:</p>
<p>Now we give you the chance to solve these doubts that keep you
awake at night. You can buy questions that we will translate into the proper
language and get answered by the locals.  During the trip, we will be
uploading all the answers either in video with subtitles or in written format
(if video is not possible) to our <a href=""https://woanderers.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://woanderers.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">blog</a>. There,
you will also find some examples of questions, which you can sponsor if you are
not inspired now.</p>
<p>Want to make you home a bit more international? We will send you
a postcard from wherever you prefer in our itinerary (check it out <a href=""https://woanderers.wordpress.com/2015/05/09/what-we-will-see/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://woanderers.wordpress.com/2015/05/09/what-we-will-see/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>)!</p>
<p>Is a postcard too dull for you and you want a more intense
experience of China? Yueyang, or more accurately, Jun Shan island, a few km
away from Yueyang is the original place of the famous Junshan Yingzhen tea. Why
not try this rare tea, regarded as one of the three most famous teas in China
(as a historical note, it was Mao’s favourite)?</p>
<p>Also, we have devoted a long time planning our trip through
Vietnam and Cambodia and we know how tedious and daunting it can be. We
therefore offer all the information concerning hostels, transport, visas, etc.
we gather throughout our journey. This will be accompanied with the possibility
of talking to us via Skype after our trip so that you can ask us any doubts in
relation with planning your adventure (you can find our planned itinerary
at our <a href=""woanderers.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""https://woanderers.wordpress.com/2015/05/09/what-we-will-see/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""https://woanderers.wordpress.com/2015/05/09/what-we-will-see/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">blog</a>).</p>
<p>Finally, if you have any other request (eg: some Chinese recipe)
or would like any other item that we could get somewhere in our journey,
(Chinese snake wine, Vietnamese typical clothing at Hoi An…) please contact us
at <a href=""mailto:guilleandmie@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">guilleandmie@gmail.com</a> and we will arrange its price if
possible.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>With regards to China we are hoping to generate a positive local
impact on the lives of children attending the course. Not just on an academic
level, in which their knowledge of the language will be enhanced, but also on
the integral formation of the children. It is one thing to be introduced to the
English language, but it is another more motivating experience to interact actively
with the culture. Thus, we will carry out activities to make children
understand why it is important to learn English, in order to make the process
more enjoyable for them and to instill interest and self-motivation for
learning.  On top of everything, the activities that will carried out
involve taking the leap forward in oral skills and losing the fear of speaking
out loud. Finally, with Guillermo's musical knowledge we will try and create a
choir, as learning songs is a fun and simple way to learn about Western
culture!</p>
<p>The acquisition of projectors will have a significant effect on
the long-term of the classroom, as it adds color to the lectures, and allows
for much more student participation.</p>
<p>Lastly, through our <a href=""woanderers.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://woanderers.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">blog</a> and our narration of the experience we aim to inspire more people to dare to explore
South East Asia in a more personal and local way, as well as make the point
that culture influences our perspective, as we hope the answers to the
questions will show.</p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>In you cannot contribute with money that's fine! It will be
enough that you share this with your friends or anybody that you think could be
interested in our project! Besides, if you have any suggestion that you think
might improve our project, please do not hesitate to contact us at <a href=""mailto:guilleandmie@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">guilleandmie@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<p>Also, if you have any English book or dictionary that you do not
want please send it to Guillermo Pascual, St Catherine's College, Oxford OX1
3UJ and we will make sure that Chinese children will be able to enjoy it. If
you have any doubt please contact us.</p>

to spend your summer volunteering in China, we highly recommend you contact

Colegio De La Estrella is in need of $2,700.
Less the processing fees, we will be able to restore/replace the termites-infested

Effective

Summary
Friday, June 6.  Beginning at 7:30 pm, 476 Bay Street, Victoria...

DRESS: Smart Casual; Cocktail Party; Dressed Up
BRING: CASH and COIN for Bars - both Candy and Drinks
THINK: Arrange for a safe way home
PREPARE: To socialize, dance, drink and eat really delicious appies
It's a party for Gustavson School of Business MBA program community. We're celebrating  our accomplishments because as recent or soon-to-be graduates of the MBA program, we've been through a lot - travelled, laughed, cried, danced and banged our heads against the wall as we worked in teams, completed challenging projects and studied for exams. 
You get a truly fun evening of socializing, eating, drinking and 
dancing. An opportunity to hear or make a short speech and win some 
cohort chosen awards. Just $25/person.  Tickets will not be sold at the door. 

Our goal is not only to have a wonderful evening, but to pay our success forward by creating one or more financial awards for a Gustavson MBA student from the funds raised after all MBABash expenses have been paid. 

 It's not all about the students.  Family and friends who've endured our shenanigans and absences from home over the past years are to be celebrated too. 

Gustavson faculty, staff and mentors have been an integral part of our MBA journey and we'd like to celebrate their successes too. Phew! That's a lot of students to contend with.
We're hoping to have 10 MBA cohorts connect - from 2009-2013.  This event will strengthen our network - introduce us to MBA's we haven't had an opportunity to meet yet and reconnect with those we haven't seen in a while.

learning organization founded at the University of Delaware in 2009. Founder
Sarah LaFave named the organization in memory of her mother, Lori, who died in
2003 from breast cancer. Lori’s Hands connects college student
volunteers with people in their communities who have chronic illnesses. Students provide in-home assistance (grocery shopping, yard work, light
cleaning) and, in turn, these community members teach the students about the human experience
of chronic illness. Lori’s Hands provides relief to patients during difficult
times, and helps future professionals become more aware of the every
day challenges that come with illness.The Lori's Hands volunteer experience is now part of a service learning course at the University of Delaware. In the
classroom, students learn about chronic illness from a wide range of
interdisciplinary perspectives. Topics include public policy, the economic
burden of healthcare in America, Caregiver Role Strain, and a patient's own
sense of identity. In addition, students are required to make a weekly
volunteer visit to a client with an illness such as cancer, Parkinson's, COPD,
ALS, or MS. The course offers a unique opportunity for students to fill a gap in the community and provide a much needed service for patients, while also gaining knowledge and experiences that will better prepare them for future careers in human services, healthcare, or public policy. 
Lori's Hands is ready to grow beyond the UD campus! The $50,000 raised through this campaign will allow us to hire our first paid staff person who will support students and faculty at other campuses who want to start chapters. We have received dozens of calls and emails from people who want help founding Lori's Hands at their schools. We want to offer our streamlined processes and years of experience to these eager individuals so that their chapters can be successful.

<h2>The Awra
Amba Story<br/>
</h2>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 5.0pt;""><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""font-family: Verdana; color: #4D4D4D;"">Awra Amba is
a small community located in the North West of Ethiopia – a rural, undeveloped
area where most people rely on subsistence farming. The brainchild of an Ethiopian farmer called Zumra Nuru, Awra Amba was founded in the 1970s with the goal </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: Verdana;"">of solving socio-economic problems through helping one another in
an environment of egalitarianism. Zumra himself had not had access to education and his ideas were based on lived experiences and a strong desire to create a more just society that respects all human beings. Today, almost 40 years later, the community is universally lauded as a
model to alleviate poverty and promote gender equality in a country where women
are generally subservient to men. Awra Amba is an extraordinary initiative
within a traditional and conservative community because of its gender equality,
its work ethic, its social security system and its strong belief in education.</span></p>

We want to support them
with their self-initiated school project. The nearest high school currently is a
14 km walk from Awra Amba and there is a real need for a high school in the area.
With their own resources, the community has already started building the
foundations for the school and constructing one classroom. They still need to
build more classrooms, a library and a science lab in order to meet
Government standards to run the school.</span></p><p></p><p></p>

</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>We need as much money as we can get; the more you donate, the more discs we can order and the cheaper they will be.  All money will go towards ordering discs, which will then be sold to create a perpetual fund for discs, ameliorating our need for funding.  No matter how much we raise, it will all go towards ordering discs, so please donate!</p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Our team has never recieved funding, so any donations you can make will go a long way towards helping us buy equipment, and towards making us financially independent.  Our team is one of a few in the New York City Ultimate league, and any money you can donate will help both our team, the BardBarians Ultimate team, and the league grow.  It will also help those on our team who cannot afford discs get equipment so that they can practice and play on their own, and show their support for team at the same time. Lastly, you will be helping the awesome sport of Ultimate grow, not only in my school, but in New York City and the nation.</p>

<p>Right now, I'm a student in Melbourne, from a
country in Asia. I was trying to finish my undergraduate arts studies, and
I did not care about my grades as I should have done. I am here on a
scholarship from the Bruneian government, and I have breached the terms of
my bond by failing in subjects. Now, I have to finish at least another year's
worth of subjects in order to complete my Bachelor of Arts. I should not have
failed, since breaching the contract will cost me about half a million to pay
back, since that was how much my government has sponsored me so far. I
hold myself responsible for my actions, which I am ashamed of now. So, I want
to make up for everything. I want to keep studying so I can support my family.
You can help me change my future, and my family's, and aid my turnaround. </p>
<p>I took the scholarship in the hope of gaining
employment from the Bruneian government. I have failed them, so it’s only
fair they withdraw me from their Ministry of Education based scholarship. Since
I am an international student in Australia, there are not many scholarships
available to us, and especially myself, since I do not meet many requirements.
But if I can pay for another year, and do well, then more opportunities will
open up to me. Neither my parents are employed, since both of them cannot work
anymore. My mother has contracted a cyst and this has affected her ability
to support her family, and my father is on pension. Furthermore, I have three
younger brothers who aren’t yet in uni. By failing my obligations, I have put
them in trouble. I don’t want to make them work themselves because of mistakes
I have made. </p>
<p>Let me illustrate: a civil servant in the Bruneian
government may earn as little as about 800/month. Wages where I am from aren’t
as high as OECD countries, so it will take my parents ages to work my debt off.
</p>
<p>This campaign is important to me now, because, it
will help me and my family out of poverty, and build a better future for
ourselves. And for me personally, a lesson hard learnt. I have done wrong, and
I want to be able to move forward from my past, and be someone who is responsible
and can take care of himself and others. I hope this opportunity, right after
my failure, will allow me to serve and be part of the global community.</p>
<p>By contributing to this campaign, you will have
lifted a family out of poverty and put their children through university, so
that we may gain employment, and a tomorrow. We do not have a highly
developed welfare system back where I am from, and there are limited
opportunities for the poor to get help (and if there is, there isn't much in it
for them). though I have wasted this opportunity, it is also a chance for
me to grow.</p>
<p>The $531,200 can be broken down as follows:</p>
<p>AUD500, 000 is for paying back the bond</p>
<p>AUD31, 200 goes towards paying for my tuition fees
(to finish my bachelors degree). This covers the cost of 10 subjects, which
cost AUD3, 120 each for international students.</p>
<p>When I graduate from my Bachelor of Arts at the
University of Melbourne, I will send all my contributors some photos of my
graduation. </p>
<p>As I do not have much at the moment, I can only
manage thanks and prayers, as well as continual correspondence at present. But
I hope that in the future, we can arrange to meet, perhaps skype, so that I can
thank you in person once I am able to (which I hope will be sooner rather
 than later). I will also send you thank you gifts, and would welcome your
continued encouragement in my academic growth.</p>
<p>To overcome my challenges ahead, I will do whatever
it takes to do well in my studies. I will manage reading for my essays better, and
work more ambitiously. If I can manage another year in my Bachelors, that will
be because you helped.</p>
<p>It would be great, if you all could spread this campaign around! If I do
not reach my goal, I will use whatever is there to pay for my last year of uni
and pay off the debt. Thank you.</p>

Thanda After- School was started three years ago in Kwa-Zulu Natal, South Africa by Angela Larkan, one of a few leading forces who has studied the wide-reaching, negative effects of the AIDS pandemic and rural poverty, and who has come up with workable, holistic solutions. She was first moved to design a support system for orphans after learning about the enormous scale of the problem and realizing that her home country, South Africa, could not support so many orphans. Today, there are 33 million people living with HIV/AIDS in Africa and there are already 12 million orphans; one fifth of South African children are orphans. 
 
Through education, mentoring and community-driven initiatives, Thanda After-School is inspiring and teaching South Africa’s most vulnerable children to be future leaders. Thanda After-School knows that by giving the next generation the tools they need to cope with the daily traumas they face and overcome the underlying problems that HIV/AIDS is leaving in its wake, local communities can discover opportunities and find the means to triumph over hardships like poverty, disease, and lack of education.
Thanda After-School’s approach is based on the traditional Zulu culture whereby the community assists members in need. Thanda After-School's unique approach uses already-existing local resources – such as classrooms and sports fields – to provide support to vulnerable children after school every day, enabling them to stay in their community while learning education and life skills.
 
Thanda currently operates in three low –performing government schools, where resources are extremely limited and pass rates are very low. Thanda After-School enrolls 325 orphans of AIDS and other vulnerable children aged between 5 and 22 years, in eleven different after school programs each day, such as computers, art, soccer, basketball, dancing, agriculture and construction.
 

Thanda employs young role models from within the community to be mentors for these students, filling the developmental and emotional gaps left by missing parents and overwhelmed caregivers.  
Thanda uses activities such as agriculture to teach kids about team work, respect, and leadership. Thanda also focuses on HIV prevention, skills development, and guidance as part of the mentorship provided every day. Every aspect of Thanda After-School was designed alongside the local community members to ensure its sustainability and effectiveness.
 
The long term benefits of Thanda After-School are of most consequence. The students have the same teacher for a full school year, which allows the young staff members to identify with their kids on a personal and experiential level, putting them in a prime position to instil in these vulnerable children the skills and values they need to become self-reliant and responsible leaders in Africa. 
 
 


The Impact



 
Thanda's agriculture program teaches practical skills to orphans and vulnerable children and the local community with the goal of creating fresh and sustainable local food supplies, decreasing malnutrition, and promoting self-reliance in the community . 
Our courses combine classroom theory with functional training using Thanda's own vegetable garden.
We focus on new, exciting areas of agriculture, like permaculture and organic farming, while making sure participants are familiar with gardening basics, like which seasons are best to grow certain foods and when prime harvesting times take place.
 
We believe that a hands-on approach to agriculture is the best way to get students to acquire knowledge of this demanding vocation and share it with their families, friends, and fellow community members. 
 
The children in the Agriculture program are given a nutritious meal each day (for some, this is the first meal for the day) and the children receive help with their school homework as well as lifeskills development.
 
Thanda After-School is successful because it is a prototype that works and is easily adaptable to any community and their needs.  Thanda After -School uses resources that are available and works with the community for the community.

<p><span style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px;"">We are the 'Bac Party Reunion Committee', a small group of people who passed their Baccalaureate at the European School of Luxembourg in 2005. We heard of previous years organising small, low-key reunions and wanted to go BIGGER with ours. Not only for our year, but for all the years (immediately) above and below ours too.

We are the 'Bac Party Reunion Committee', a small group of people who passed their Baccalaureate at the European School of Luxembourg in 2005. We heard of previous years organising small, low-key reunions and wanted to go BIGGER with ours. Not only for our year, but for all the years (immediately) above and below ours too. It's important to us to regroup as MANY people as possible from school to make this milestone of our life one to remember. So, since all of us members of the 'Bac Party Reunion Committee' live and work in Luxembourg, we decided to use our connections and knowledge of the city to organise it. However, since the school isn't helping in any way, we need your support in order to ensure our ideal party.   What We Need & What You Get
What we need from you is to buy a ticket for the party BEFORE the party! Original, right? The way things work is that the more tickets we sell, the MORE you GET. We are not personally making ANY money at all on this. ALL the benefit will be re-invested directly into extra bits and bobs to make the party that much better. But once again, the earlier you get your ticket, the easier it will be for us to organise all these extra things. Which include (in this order):

The whole of MARX bar booked for us from 4pm until midnight! For those who know the place, we're sure you'll be picturing yourself sipping a drink in their sunny garden during the afternoon and chatting to that-guy-you-sat-next-to-in-English-class about your five overweight cats, your newborn kid, your newly-built house, your dirty flatmate, your job successes or how many times you managed to get fired in 10 years. But if you live in Berlin and are used to start dancing at 4pm, that's OK too. There is an inside bar with DJs throughout the day and night. So go rave on until other regular people join you at a more respectable time to dance. YES we could ONLY get the place exclusively booked for us until midnight. BUT did we mention that the Bac Party ticket also allows you to stay in Marx after midnight to hear MARKUS KAVKA spin some decks? If you have NO idea who the guy is: remember when you were 16 and switched the TV channel to MTV Germany? Yeah, THAT's him.  
A freaking Photo Booth! You haven't seen each other in 10 years, what better way to gloat about who has aged best? Also, it doubles up as fairly good souvenir snaps. 
Free DRINKS! ALL the money that comes in excess will go into free beer, wine and soft drinks (MARX will already be doing special prices on drinks overall and a really special price on a summery beverage). 
FOOD will be available for purchase either way. Details to be released soon.

   Do You Need To Be From BAC 2005 Too? 
NO. We encourage people from the years immediately above and below to join too. After all, we all had friends who were in those years. We trust you not to push it though. If you are STILL in school, you'll probably get told at the door to go do your physics homework. Significant others are also welcome but will be required to purchase a ticket too. Toddlers however get free entrance. 
 PS: Teachers, we all know you have now learned how to 'surf the web' and are reading this too. You are of course more than welcome to join the festivities.

<h3>Our Story</h3>Hello my name is Zoe Bullard and I'm 12 years old. As far back as I can remember I've always loved dolphins, whales, and sea life. As growing up it never changed for me. I now know that I want to work with sea life when I grow up and become a marine biologist. That is why I want to attend Sea Trek. Sea Trek is a marine biology, diving, sailing summer camp/school. I wrote an essay on why I want to attend Sea Trek and they gave me a scholarship! The camp is located in the British Virgin Islands. I can earn up to 6 diving certifications, tag and monitor sea turtles, Island Excursions, watersports, go on explorations with real marine biologist, sailing training including hands-on navigation and piloting on a 45 foot Catamaran. Our science lab is also on a catamaran!<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">How awesome is that! </span>  <br/>                                                                                                                                                                                My departure is July 30 and return August 19, 2011 if I am able to raise the funds for this adventure. <br/><br/><p><br/></p>

<h3>The Impact    </h3>By attending Sea Trek I will be able to see if this truly is what I desire. I can start to get my certifications and science credits for school. I now attend a music and dance school, but I will switch schools to a science and math High School. My mom supports my brother and I and can not afford to send me to Sea Trek on her own.

<h3>Why This Book? Why Now?</h3>
<p>The book's purpose is to educate today’s LGBTQ youth on their female heroes. <i>Game Changers </i>pays tribute to lesbians who came out early in their lives and whose tremendous cultural and legal accomplishments helped define the current LGBTQ culture in the USA. The featured women made specific long-term contributions towards raising LGBTQ awareness, eliminating discrimination and changing laws. Whatever freedom today's young LGBTQ members enjoy is based on these women's courage, hard work and sacrifices. I think its safe to assume that when <a href=""http://www.faireducationact.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The FAIR Act</a> is implemented there will be a poster of Harvey Milk in most California classrooms. With all due respect to history, while Milk helped make real changes to the civil rights laws, there are also trailblazing women who need to be celebrated! Together, we can make this happen.</p>

<h3>The Impact of This Book:</h3>
<p>This book will not only educate about the influence lesbians had on LGBTQ culture, but it is intended to <strong>INSPIRE </strong>young people to stand up for what they believe in.</p>
<p>An excerpt from the introduction: “<i>Every single woman featured here changed the world in some way. Each worked hard and believed in herself, never backing down from a prevailing culture filled with discrimination and bigotry. They all stepped up, followed their hearts and ultimately helped pave the way for acceptance of the LGBTQ youth of today.</i></p>
<p><i>These women are American heroes and they are a part of all our histories. Whether you are gay, bisexual, straight, trans, gender non-conforming or anything in between, I hope you will find inspiration in these pages. You can stand up for what you believe in and make a difference, too!”</i></p>
<h3><strong>What Exactly is Game Changers?</strong></h3>
<p>Created as a richly-designed interactive package, this large format book will dedicate six pages to each woman and feature pull-out <strong>Game Cards</strong> for each of them highlighting <strong>‘fun facts’</strong>. This deck of cards is a playful way to encourage people to learn about the featured women. Additionally there will be <strong>Resource Guide</strong> section as well as photos and bios of <strong>‘Other Notable Lesbians’. </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Who is the Author?​</strong></h3>

Created as a richly-designed interactive package, this large format book will dedicate six pages to each woman and feature pull-out Game Cards for each of them highlighting ‘fun facts’. This deck of cards is a playful way to encourage people to learn about the featured women. Additionally there will be Resource Guide section as well as photos and bios of ‘Other Notable Lesbians’.

<p class=""p1"">We are Brian and Jeannette. We are dancers with a background in latin dances and funk-styles hip-hop. Individually, we have been dancing since childhood for talent shows, plays, and high school functions, but it wasn't until we became dance partners in San Diego circa 2005 that we learned we can inspire others through our passion. Our love for dance has taken us to many different countries, including Puerto Vallarta, Mexico where we resided as restaurant owners by day, and dance instructors by night. Now back in the Bay Area where we both grew up, we are honored to be dancers with the DS Players, a funk-styles hip hop family with the same passion for dance. Throughout our travels, we have been reaching out to the youth to share and empower children with creative arts, such as dance. We have taught workshops at foster care centers, schools, and have been involved with a non-profit organization called Soulciety, who has a mission statement to enrich and empower at-risk and underprivileged youth. This year, we were given the opportunity to travel to the Philippines with Soulciety and their Bridge Program on their next trip in 2014.  Along with co-ordinating school supply and personal hygiene donation drives to take to villages in the Philippines, we will be teaching dance workshops throughout our stay.</p>
<h3>The Bridge Program</h3>
<p>     <strong>The Bridge </strong>is an overseas educational mission and cultural immersion program that gives youth and young adults from the Bay Area and other parts of the U.S. an opportunity to provide resources and education to impoverished youth in different parts of the world. The program focuses on providing services and aid to the youth in the Philippines as they are in dire need of support.<br/><br/>     <strong>Issues in the Philippines include</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Philippines is an international hotspot for human trafficking, ranking among the top five countries in the world where most human trafficking victims come from. An estimated 100,000 children are trafficked in the Philippines, most of which are forced to become sex slaves in China, Japan, Europe, the Middle East, and the U.S.</li>
<li>40% of the Philippines' population (27.6 million people) lives under the poverty line. 1.4 million are street children.</li>
<li>11% of children (2.2 million in 2001) are forced into labor.</li>
<li>6 million children are malnourished</li>
</ul>

</h3>
<h3>Our Goal</h3>
<p>    With this program, our goal is to reach 8000 youth throughout the provinces of the Philippines by providing support and supplies to further their education and improve their health.</p>
<p>     <strong>Other program objectives include</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing 100 computers in order to build a minimum of 3 Computer Learning centers at schools and develop a computer literacy curriculum that will be taught to teachers to help youth reach their educational goals and prepare them for the work force</li>
<li>Promote Performing Arts education through music, dance, and poetry</li>
<li>Providing another 1000 pairs of shoes and promote proper footwear awareness</li>
<li>Provide another 5000 hygiene supplies such as toothbrushes, toothpaste, floss, shampoo, and soap and promote proper hygiene awareness</li>
<li>Provide another 5000 school materials such as backpacks, binders, and writing utensils to promote educational advancement</li>

</h3>
<h3>What exactly does the money go to?</h3>
<p>     Our main purpose for being involved is to help with the services and education that is being provided by the program. There will be about a total of 12-16 of us that will be travelling to the Philippines to educate and provide for the impoverish communities. Each individual is responsible for fundraising $3000 which will cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flight: $1200</li>
<li>Lodging: $700</li>
<li>Transportation: $100</li>
<li>Food: $300</li>
<li>Daily Expenses: $400</li>
<li>Special Projects: $300</li>
</ul>
<p>     In case our $3000 goal each is not reached ($6000 together), we will not be able to travel to the Philippines to take part in the 2014 Bridge Program, but all funds raised will go towards coordinating the program.</p>

Short Summary
CENIT, El Centro de la Niña Trabajadora, or the Center for the Working Girl, as it is known in English, is a non-governmental, non-profit organization devoted to helping working children (especially girls) and their families overcome grinding poverty and improve their quality of lives through education and job training, nutrition programs, health and social services, psychological help and recreation.
Why are we asking for money now?
CENIT's work against poverty is in serious peril. In most countries, basic infrastructure, such as fire hydrants and pressurized water, are government-provided. Here in Ecuador, it is the opposite. CENIT must install a cistern, a high-powered pump and an access point for firefighting equipment. Rather than help to provide these things, the government is simply threatening to close CENIT if we cannot comply with their requirements by March 19. 
 
What We Need
Your donation will keep CENIT alive as you help to accomplish the following request by the government:
Enable firefighters to extinguish in case of fire: CENIT must repair its water cistern in order to provide sufficient water pressure for firefighters. 
- This alone costs $5,000.
Hire architects to work out a precise plan of CENIT’s building complex.
- This will take about $4,000.
Set up fire extinguishers: CENIT has to establish fire extinguishers on each floor of every building. With three school buildings with five floors, this adds up to 15 extingushers, plus three in CENIT's external areas, for a total of 18.   
- To install the extinguishers will require approximately $1,000.
 
CENIT relies on your help and does not have the means to meet these requirements with its current funds!
What You Get

You keep CENIT alive and give educational opportunities to people in Quito.

CENIT implements workshops in order to train students and families for future jobs as well as to increase its degree of self-sufficiency. As a gift, you can receive handcrafts produced by CENIT's students and families.

 
The Impact
With your contribution you will help to maintain all the programs shown in the video and many more that are implemented by a staff of 35 Ecuadorian workers and about 35 national (Ecuadorian) and international volunteers:


Primary and High School including Psychological Help and Health Services


116 students receive education at CENIT as well as job training


Street Outreach programs for working children at two markets


150 children in CENIT’s Street Outreach Program (Rescate de Calle)

Tutoring Center

85 students attend CENIT’s Tutoring Center (CEA)


Clinic and the Street Clinic


45 market sellers visited weekly during CENIT’s Street Clinic, as well as hepatitis vaccinations and free dental treatment by our dentist volunteer to all of CENIT’s students in need as well as CEA participants.

Family Support by our social workers

Family Support and Training is bi-monthly, provided to 424 families.

More: Low-cost, high-nutrition lunch for kids from the tutoring center and for students; soccer club for the schools; card-making workshop; the creative support project; student sponsoring and much more.  
 
All our programs are dedicated to people living in poverty in Quito who desperately need CENIT's support.

<p>Die „<strong>Sealand Multiversity of the seven seas</strong>“ vereinigt Aktivisten, Wissenschaftler und Changemaker aller Bereiche, um gemeinsam Open-Source-Lösungen für unseren bedrohten Planeten zu entwickeln.</p>
<p>Wir sind eine wachsene cokreative Gruppe, die nicht darauf warten möchte, dass die Politik oder Konzerne die Welt retten. Humanistische Erfindungen und ihre Implementierung in großem Stil kann auch von der wachsenden „Open-Society“ durch Open-Source Lösungen und koordinierte Grassroots-Aktionen erreicht werden.</p>
<p>Die <strong>Sealand Multiversity</strong> besteht aus zwei Bereichen:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Offshore-Campus:</strong> Der Offshore-Campus auf Sealand dient als Medien-Symbol für eine nachhaltige, faire Gesellschaft sowie als Testplattform für konkrete nachhaltige Anwendungen und Innovationen.</li>
<li>
<strong>Online-Campus:</strong> Hier sammeln, präsentieren und verbreiten wir geprüfte Beispielprojekte und implementieren sie weltweit durch kostenlose, internetgestützte „Do-it-yourself (DIY)workshops“. Darüberhinaus bieten wir virtuelle Vorlesungen, Konferenzen und Mitmachaktionen für persönlichen und gesellschaftlichen Wandel an.

<h3>Die Wirkung</h3>
<p>Es gibt mehr als genug Wissen, Kreativität, Empathie und Engagement auf der Welt, um der kritischen Situation unseres Planeten aktiv zu begegnen. Und die rasant wachsende open-source community ist als Global Player neu im Spiel dabei. Mal sehen, wie weit uns Schwarmintelligenz, CoCreation-Management und koordinierte Aktionen bringen können. Jedoch nicht aus Profitinteresse, sondern aus der einfachen Motivation heraus, unseren schönen Planeten fair und nachhaltig zu teilen und zu schützen.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mit Ihrer Unterstützung werden wir astrten, das ungeheure kreative Potential der ""open community"" zu versammeln, um gezielt konkrete freie Problemlösungen zu entwickeln. Wir unterstützen machbare Beispielprojekte oder realisieren diese gemeinsam mit dezentralen Partnern in geeigneten Umgebungen und verbreiten das entstehende Wissen weitestmöglich.</li>
<li>Der initiierende gemeinnützige Verein Positive Nett-Works e.V. arbeitet seit mehr als 15 Jahren an derlei Projekten und könnte Bücher mit seinen Aktionen für direkten humanitären Nutzen füllen. (<a href=""http://www.p-n-w.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.p-n-w.net</a>)</li>
<li>Wir haben die beabsichtigten Formate “glokale DIY+CC-workshops”, “Lösungsorientierte cokreative Synergiesysteme” und “Virtuelle Mitmach-Happenings” bereits erfolgreich getestet und können es kaum abwarten, diese Werkzeuge für gesellschaftlichen Wandel nun in großem Stil einzusetzen.</li>

Kurzdarstellung
In der autonomen Mikronation Sealand, einer besetzten Seefestung vor der englischen Küste ( www.sealandgov.org ), haben wir einen MakerSpace für globalen Wandel gegründet.
Die „Sealand Multiversity of the seven seas“ vereinigt Aktivisten, Wissenschaftler und Changemaker aller Bereiche, um gemeinsam Open-Source-Lösungen für unseren bedrohten Planeten zu entwickeln.
Wir sind eine wachsene cokreative Gruppe, die nicht darauf warten möchte, dass die Politik oder Konzerne die Welt retten. Humanistische Erfindungen und ihre Implementierung in großem Stil kann auch von der wachsenden „Open-Society“ durch Open-Source Lösungen und koordinierte Grassroots-Aktionen erreicht werden.
Die Sealand Multiversity besteht aus zwei Bereichen:


Offshore-Campus: Der Offshore-Campus auf Sealand dient als Medien-Symbol für eine nachhaltige, faire Gesellschaft sowie als Testplattform für konkrete nachhaltige Anwendungen und Innovationen.

Online-Campus: Hier sammeln, präsentieren und verbreiten wir geprüfte Beispielprojekte und implementieren sie weltweit durch kostenlose, internetgestützte „Do-it-yourself (DIY)workshops“. Darüberhinaus bieten wir virtuelle Vorlesungen, Konferenzen und Mitmachaktionen für persönlichen und gesellschaftlichen Wandel an. Bitte schauen Sie sich das detaillierte Campus-Konzept an (www.artlab4.de/multiversity) oder lassen Sie sich inspirieren von unserem langfristigen Projekt „asap-island“, bei dem wir aus Recyclingmaterialien schwimmende Rettungsinseln für Überschwemmungsgebiete bauen. http://www.asap-island.org 


Hört sich zu gut an, um wahr zu sein? Probieren wir´s einfach aus. Vielleicht sind wir genau diejenigen, auf die wir immer gewartet haben?

<h3>Joy's Hope Summer Academy</h3>
<p>Joy’s Hope is a summer school program for children in the Wichita, Kansas.</p>
<p>The founder's mother, Joy, died from COPD in 2010. She wanted to honor her  mother in a way that would show how loving and caring she was. That summer many things were cut from the local school district due to budget cuts from the state – one of these things was summer school. That same summer, she had a student who no longer qualified for special education services – even though he still desperately needed the services. All of these things hit her at the same time. She decided to open a free tutoring service for students like hers that still needed the help but had no means to pay for it. That was the beginning of Joy’s Hope.</p>
<p>Her first student that summer was that former student, of course. Soon the word spread. Before long, she had twenty students from kindergarten to sixth grade – and two who were teen moms that needed help preparing for their GED’s. It was more than she had expected.</p>
<p>Although Joy’s Hope Tutoring receives some donations from those parents who can afford it, most of the money to run it comes from the founder's own pocket. The money for books and supplies and office rent and utilities adds up very fast. It is getting to the point that she will have to shut it down because she cannot afford to keep it running. It would break her heart for this to happen. There are too many students who need this service…</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> We need $1500 to fund Summer Academy for summer 2013. For $1500, we can provide all necessary supplies for all students. Since these children have special needs, their parents often have many expenditures that are above and beyond the normal costs of raising a child. If we can provide this service and the needed supplies, that is one less worry for the parents.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
This program will help up to a dozen children with special needs. This will provide these children with the step up they need to be successful during the regular school year. This program will also prevent the loss of learning some children experience when they don't attend school during the summer.</div>

<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://morethanmudpies.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/img_7753.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/>I have come to cherish my work with the handicapped and disabled population, and find there is an incredible lack of funding for these folks, as well as pulled art education from our state's public education system for the kids!  Since art impacted my life in such a big way, and after seeing how much joy people get for the simple act of creating, I want to continue to offer these services to Centers for the disabled, Organizations set up to provide services to handicapped and underprivledged Children, as well as children in the foster care and mental health systems.</p>
<p>My goal is to attach a wonderful, creative art filled trailer on the back of my colorful More Than Mudpies vehicle, and have a traveling art classroom, where I can reach organizations I have connections with in North Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia and Florida.<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://morethanmudpies.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSCN7010.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/>  I have begun this process in Georgia, however my overall vision is to have more artists be able to jump on board and expand the More Than Mudpies mobile classrooms with student intern helpers on board as well.  These interns can come from Centers, as well as art schools, providing them hands on experience to work with these populations. </p>
<p>The funding I need initially will help me purchase a trailer,  renovated for an art room experience, purchase art materials, and do the necessary printed marketing to reach the people, let more organizations know of the traveling fine art instruction now available for their populations of consumers. <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://morethanmudpies.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/36227_444373071531_7654467_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></p>
<p>If I don't reach my goal, the money donated will go into a fund to fund the work I am currently doing in North Georgia/Atlanta area for the kids and handicapped, which I currently do not charge for.  It will buy materials, pay for marketing, transportation services and time. </p>
<p>Your contribution will help put smiles on so many innocent faces, provide rewarding work for art students as well as other artists willing and longing to to work with these populations.  The self-esteem gained from their creations is touching and IMPORTANT!  They learn strategic building skills, problem solving, and more (read <a href=""http://morethanmudpies.com/workshops-clay-classes/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://morethanmudpies.com/workshops-clay-classes/</a><span id=""editable-post-name"" title=""Click to edit this part of the permalink"">children-and-clay )</span></p>
<p>There are no grants, and I look weekly for money for the arts for my program.  I have learned, I need the people out there to hear this, feel something for it, and help make it happen. I am determined and driven to make this happen, and make it a SUCCESS! </p>
<p>If you can't contribute money, then art supplies or uplifting fun materials that can be distributed to these populations would be great also.  ANYTHING you could do to help will be recognized. </p>
<p>I ask that you SHARE my campaign, and help me reach the world with my idea.  I have the business background to make this work, and the passion to set the trail on fire with creative energy.

I have come to cherish my work with the handicapped and disabled population, and find there is an incredible lack of funding for these folks, as well as pulled art education from our state's public education system for the kids!  Since art impacted my life in such a big way, and after seeing how much joy people get for the simple act of creating, I want to continue to offer these services to Centers for the disabled, Organizations set up to provide services to handicapped and underprivledged Children, as well as children in the foster care and mental health systems.
My goal is to attach a wonderful, creative art filled trailer on the back of my colorful More Than Mudpies vehicle, and have a traveling art classroom, where I can reach organizations I have connections with in North Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia and Florida.  I have begun this process in Georgia, however my overall vision is to have more artists be able to jump on board and expand the More Than Mudpies mobile classrooms with student intern helpers on board as well.  These interns can come from Centers, as well as art schools, providing them hands on experience to work with these populations. 
The funding I need initially will help me purchase a trailer,  renovated for an art room experience, purchase art materials, and do the necessary printed marketing to reach the people, let more organizations know of the traveling fine art instruction now available for their populations of consumers. 
If I don't reach my goal, the money donated will go into a fund to fund the work I am currently doing in North Georgia/Atlanta area for the kids and handicapped, which I currently do not charge for.  It will buy materials, pay for marketing, transportation services and time. 
Your contribution will help put smiles on so many innocent faces, provide rewarding work for art students as well as other artists willing and longing to to work with these populations.  The self-esteem gained from their creations is touching and IMPORTANT!  They learn strategic building skills, problem solving, and more (read http://morethanmudpies.com/workshops-clay-classes/children-and-clay )
There are no grants, and I look weekly for money for the arts for my program.  I have learned, I need the people out there to hear this, feel something for it, and help make it happen. I am determined and driven to make this happen, and make it a SUCCESS! 
If you can't contribute money, then art supplies or uplifting fun materials that can be distributed to these populations would be great also.  ANYTHING you could do to help will be recognized. 
I ask that you SHARE my campaign, and help me reach the world with my idea.  I have the business background to make this work, and the passion to set the trail on fire with creative energy. (my resume : www.linkedin.com/pub/lynn-dwyer/56/115/63/ )
All contributors will receive a happy clay token made by one of the students, and will be mentioned in all my marketing websites and social media platforms and will receive a letter of thanks acknowledging the help from me, and the students.

<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Top of the Terrorism List</span></strong><br/><br/> “The No. 1 domestic terrorism threat,” says John Lewis, a top FBI official, “is the eco-terrorism, animal-rights movement.”</p>
<p>The animal rights and environmental movements, like every other social movement throughout history, have both legal and illegal elements. There are people who leaflet, write letters, and lobby. There are people who protest and engage in non-violent civil disobedience. And there are people, like the Animal Liberation Front and Earth Liberation Front, who go out at night with black masks and break windows, burn SUVs, and release animals from fur farms.</p>
<p>Animal rights and environmental advocates have not flown planes into buildings, taken hostages, or sent Anthrax through the mail. They have never even injured anyone. In fact, the only act of attempted murder in the history of the U.S. animal rights movement was coordinated by corporate provocateurs. Yet the FBI ranks these activists as the top domestic terrorism threat. And the Department of Homeland Security lists them on its roster of national security threats, while ignoring right-wing extremists who have bombed the Oklahoma City federal building, murdered doctors, and admittedly created weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Defining the Green Scare</span></strong></p>
<p>This disproportionate, heavy-handed government crackdown on the animal rights and environmental movements, and the reckless use of the word “terrorism,” is often called the Green Scare.</p>
<p>Much like the Red Scare and the communist witch hunts of the 40s and 50s, the Green Scare is using one word—this time, it’s “terrorist”—to push a political agenda, instill fear, and chill dissent. And much like the Red Scare, the Green Scare is operating on three levels: legal, legislative, and what we’ll call extra-legal, or scare-mongering.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Legal</span></strong></p>
<p>The courts are being used to push conventional boundaries of what constitutes “terrorism” and to hit non-violent activists with disproportionate sentences.</p>
<p><strong><em>SHAC 7</em></strong> - A federal court convicted a group of animal advocates of “animal enterprise terrorism” for running a controversial website that supported both legal and illegal activity against a lab called Huntingdon Life Sciences. The site also listed addresses for corporations and corporate executives. The group, dubbed the SHAC 7, were never charged with breaking windows or releasing animals, but they vocally supported those types of activities. For that, they were convicted of “conspiring” to promote “terrorism.” Here’s a closer look at the SHAC 7.</p>
<p><strong><em>Operation Backfire</em></strong> - That’s the name the FBI gave to the historic roundup of environmental and animal rights activists for a string of Earth Liberation Front and Animal Liberation Front actions, including arson in the name of protecting the environment. Before these defendants ever set foot in the courtroom, they were labeled in the press as “eco-terrorists.” The government successfully pushed for “terrorism enhancement” penalties in many of these cases. As a result, many of these activists are now in prison as “terrorists,” a label that drastically changes their prison life and will follow them long after release. Another result of the “terrorism enhancement” is that the FBI claims these cases as a victory in the “War on Terrorism.”</p>
<p><strong><em>Government Informants and Infiltrators</em></strong> - Although some of the Operation Backfire defendants—Daniel McGowan, Jonathan Paul, Joyanna Zacher and Nathan Block—refused to become government informants, the others “snitched” in exchange for reduced sentences. In fact, the government has said these arrests wouldn’t have been possible if one of the defendants, Jacob Ferguson, hadn’t agreed to wear a wire and entrap his friends. We’ve seen the same thing take place in other “eco-terrorism” cases. And in the case of Eric McDavid, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for conspiring to destroy cell phone towers and other property, the FBI actually paid a young woman, “Anna,” to pose as an activist: she provided the group with bomb-making recipes; at times financed their transportation, food and housing; strung along McDavid, who had the hopes of a romantic relationship; and poked and prodded the group into action.</p>
<p><strong><em>Grand juries</em></strong> - In the name of investigating illegal activity, the government has been hauling lawful activists in front of grand juries where they must testify about their political beliefs and political associations, or face prison time. Activists like Jeff Hogg and independent journalist Josh Wolf have refused to cooperate with these witch hunts, and been punished for it. Elsewhere, noncooperation has derailed grand juries.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Legislative</span></strong></p>
<p>Even with these sweeping, and successful, legal attacks on activists, corporations and the politicians who represent them want even more power.</p>
<p><strong><em>Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act</em></strong> - With just six members of Congress in the room, just hours after lawmakers and celebrities were on hand to break ground for the new memorial honoring that terrorist Martin Luther King Jr., the House of Representatives passed the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act, a law so vague and broad that the non-violent tactics of MLK and Gandhi are now “terrorism.” The bill expanded the Animal Enterprise Protection Act, the law used to convict the SHAC 7 of “animal enterprise terrorism” just months earlier. In true Orwellian doublespeak, proponents said the law couldn’t be used to convict so-called extremists, and must be expanded. Here is a closer look at the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act.</p>
<p><strong><em>State-level Legislation</em></strong> - Even after the federal law passed, corporations still want more. There’s been a push for state “eco-terrorism” legislation similar to the federal AETA, including the the California Animal Enterprise Protection Act.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Extra-Legal </span></strong></p>
<p>Perhaps the most dangerous wing of this Green Scare is the relentless scare-mongering.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ad Campaigns</em></strong> - The new McCarthyists have used their deep pocketbooks and PR savvy to place a terrorist in every shadow. They’ve taken out full-page anonymous ads in both The New York Times and The Washington Post labeling animal rights activists as “terrorists” for being a little too successful, and knocking a controversial animal testing laboratory from the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p><strong><em>Public Relations Campaigns</em></strong> - Not even children’s movies are safe from the relentless green baiting and guilt by association. Industry groups labeled Hoot, a bestselling book and popular movie, “soft-core eco-terrorism” because the teenage protagonists try to save an endangered owl from developers. Apparently even E.B. White was an “eco-terrorist”: According to the Center for Consumer Freedom, the movie remake of Charlotte’s Web promotes animal rights extremism.</p>
<p><strong><em>Surveillance, Harassment and Infiltration</em></strong> - The corporate and government scare-mongering has been used to create a political climate that justifies surveillance and harassment of political advocates. For instance, the FBI is looking for informants to infiltrate vegan potlucks, Joint Terrorism Task Forces are spying on HoneyBaked Ham protestors, and corporations are tracking who activists are dating.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Secretive Political Prisons — Communications Management Units</span></strong></p>
<p>The label of “terrorist” is applied to activists before they even enter a courtroom and, for those convicted, it follows them into the prison system. The government has acknowledged using secretive prison facilities on U.S. soil, called Communications Management Units, to house inmates labeled “domestic terrorists.”</p>
<p>The CMUs radically restrict prisoner communications with the outside world to levels that rival, or exceed, the most restrictive facilities in the country, including the “Supermax,” ADX-Florence. [For more information on CMUs and who is housed there: ""Secretive U.S. Prison Units Used to House Muslim, Animal Rights and Environmental Activists.""]</p>
<p>Inmates and guards at the CMUs call them “Little Guantanamo.” They have also been described as prisons for “second-tier” terrorists.</p>
<p>According the Bureau of Prisons, these inmates “do not rise to the same degree of potential risk to national security” as other terrorism inmates. So who is imprisoned there?</p>
<p>The CMUs overwhelmingly include Muslim inmates, and have housed at least two animal rights and environmental activists: Andy Stepanian, who has been released, and Daniel McGowan, who is currently imprisoned at the CMU in Marion, Illinois.</p>
<p>Little information is available about the secretive facilities and the prisoners housed there. However, through interviews with attorneys, family members, and a current prisoner, it is clear that these units have been created not for violent and dangerous “terrorists,” but for political cases that the government would like to keep out of the public spotlight and out of the press.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">So Why is This Happening?</span></strong></p>
<p>The government and corporations haven’t tried to hide the fact that this is all meant to protect corporate profits. The Department of Homeland Security, in a bulletin to law enforcement agencies, warned: “Attacks against corporations by animal rights extremists and eco-terrorists are costly to the targeted company and, over time, can undermine confidence in the economy.”</p>
<p>And in a leaked PowerPoint presentation given by the State Department to corporations, we learn: “Although incidents related to terrorism are most likely to make the front-page news, animal rights extremism is what’s most likely to affect your day-to-day business operations.”</p>
<p>Underground activists like the Animal Liberation Front and Earth Liberation Front directly threaten corporate profits by doing things like burning bulldozers or sabotaging animal research equipment. But they’re not the only ones.</p>
<p>The entire animal rights and environmental movements, perhaps more than any other social movements, directly threaten corporate profits. They do it every day. Every time activists encourage people to go vegan, every time they encourage people to stop driving, every time they encourage people to consume fewer resources and live simply. Those boycotts are permanent, and these industries know it. In many ways, the Green Scare, like the Red Scare, can be seen as a culture war, a war of values.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What Effect Has This Had? </span></strong></p>
<p>The point of all this, according to the government, is to crack down on underground activists. But underground activists already know what they’re doing is illegal, and it hasn’t stopped them. In fact, it may have added fuel to the fire. For instance, the same day the SHAC 7 were convicted of “animal enterprise terrorism” for running a website that posted news of both legal and illegal actions, underground activists rescued animals from a vivisection lab and named them Jake, Lauren, Kevin, Andy, Josh, and Darius, after the defendants.</p>
<p>This is from the communiqué:</p>
<p>“And while the SHAC-7 will soon go to jail for simply speaking out on behalf of animals, those of us who have done all the nasty stuff talked about in the courts and in the media will still be free. So to those who still work with HLS and to all who abuse animals: we’re coming for you, motherfuckers.”</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What Now?</span></strong><br/><br/> So if outlandish prison sentences and “eco-terrorism” rhetoric aren’t deterring crimes or solving crimes, what’s the point?</p>
<p>Fear. It’s all about fear. The point is to protect corporate profits by instilling fear in the mainstream animal rights and environmental movements—and every other social movement paying attention—and make people think twice about using their First Amendment rights.</p>
<p>Industry groups say “this is just the starting gun” for the Green Scare. But this could be the starting gun for activists as well. I’ve talked with hundreds of activists around the country over the years. There’s a lot of fear. But there’s also a lot of rage. And that’s a very good thing.</p>
<p>Because today’s repression may mimic many of the tactics of the Red Scare, but today’s response cannot. It’s not enough to cowardly distance ourselves from anyone branded a communist, I mean, terrorist. Naming names and making loyalty oaths didn’t protect activists then, and it won’t protect activists now.</p>
<p>The only way activists, and the First Amendment, are going to get through this is by coming out and confronting it head-on. That means reaching out to mainstream Americans and telling them that labeling activists as terrorists wastes valuable anti-terrorism resources and is an insult to everyone who died in the twin towers. That means reaching out to other activists and saying loud and clear that these activists are just the canaries in the mine.</p>
<p>Together, we can stop they cycle of history repeating itself.</p></div>","Will Potter is an award-winning independent journalist based in Washington, D.C. and author of Green Is the New Red: An Insider’s Account of a Social Movement Under Siege.  Potter’s presentation focuses on how fear of “terrorism” is being exploited to push a political and corporate agenda, and how animal rights and environmental advocates are being branded “eco-terrorists” in what many are calling the Green Scare.

<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<strong>Quests:</strong> Cool activities and fun games built to introduce girls to various financial concepts, drawing out their natural curiosity to seek out answers to provided questions or clues, leading them to reflect on the learnings and apply concepts in real life. There will be a minimum of four Quests in each box, each presented to by an illustrated character that will take you and your girl through the Quest!</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<strong>Parent Guide:</strong> A very easy to follow step-by-step guide for you to walk your girl through the Quests in various ways, such as: engaging her curiosity, posing reflective questions, helping her explore real-life examples and situations, and going through learning checkpoints. The guide will provide suggestions, tips, examples, question guide, answers, and different ways of going through specific Quests.</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<strong>Complementary Products:</strong> Everything necessary to complete the Quests, so you don't need to purchase any extra materials (with the exception of some bonus Quests we may add)! These may include items like worksheets, game cards, saving boxes, play money, books, journals, crayons, stickers, puzzles, games, quick questionnaires with pre-paid postage envelopes, fun rewards and more, all depending on what Quests are included in that specific box.</li>

Through an annual subscription, girls will receive a different box every month, for 12 months, filled with Quests (activities and games), parent guidelines, supporting materials, rewards and other fun items!</p><p><strong><i>Why experiential learning?</i></strong></p><p>Like many education experts, we believe that the best way to learn a subject is by doing, reflecting on, and applying what’s been learned. That’s particularly important when the subject matter is considered by many to be complex or boring. Young girls, in particular, tend to do better when they are given real world context for different scenarios and problems. Their natural curiosity is well suited to experiential learning programs. We’ve worked hard to create programs girls will find interactive, engaging, and fun!</p><p><i><strong>Why not boys? </strong></i></p><p>We decided to focus on girls because of the many challenges they automatically face due to their gender, starting from childhood. We believe that for a woman to have options in life and to make the choices she wants, she needs to be financially empowered, and that starts early.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474919717/h0yyq69vseidqsw6oelw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>When they do enter the workforce, they are faced with distinct challenges like the gender-based wage gap, having to work less years due to child-rearing, needing to save more for retirement because they outlive men by an average of 7 years, and much more.</p><p><i><strong>Can boys use the boxes?</strong></i></p><p>Of course!</p><p><i><strong>Which education standards do you use and why?</strong></i></p><p>Our curriculum is based on standards presented by the <a href=""https://www.financialeducatorscouncil.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">National Financial Educators Council</a>, which were established through a collaborative effort by a team of experts using research and feedback from hundreds of individual educators and financial professionals. </p><p><i><strong>Who are your education experts?</strong></i></p><p>We have counted on the expertise behind the National Coalition for Financial Educators who have developed the standards we used.

This is just our first product!Will you have them in different languages?Yes. We plan to offer our programs in other languages, beginning with Spanish as soon as we can. We would love to hear from you if you are interested in having it in other languages beyond English and Spanish in the future!Is inherQuests a non-profit?No, it is a for-profit business. We do not want to rely on donors to fund early financial education for girls, and so we elected to be a for-profit company with a social cause.Where are you located?inherQuests is headquartered in New York, NY. In terms of stores, we are only available online at the moment.How big is your team?inherQuests is the brainchild of Dina Shoman, with dedicated support from a cast of reputable agencies and advisors. Plans to grow the internal team are in the works!Will inherQuests be available outside of the US?For right now, we can only ship with the US; however, as we grow, we are looking to expand into other markets and to see how to localize the content based on local requirements, languages, culture and norms as needed. Sign up for our newsletter to stay updated!  Our girls have BIG dreams, and we want them to grow up to become capable and confident of making smart financial choices.

  The Project<br/><p>The treasured UNESCO world heritage site of Bodh Gaya - the place of the Buddha’s Enlightenment - is plagued by enormous amounts of plastic pollution, among other challenges that threaten the local ecology, economy, &amp; community.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"">Visited by thousands of Buddhists, Hindus, and tourists who come on spiritual pilgrimages from all over the world, Bodh Gaya is a</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"">lso home to a local village population of around 40,000 Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, and Christians. </span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); line-height: 1.45em;"">Bodh Gaya based NGO, Sacred Earth Trust, in collaboration with global Partners in Empowerment: Empowerment Works and Living Mandala, have teamed up with diverse members of the local community to transform Bodh Gaya's plastic pollution problem into a sustainable building solution for the region. </span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); line-height: 1.45em;"">Through implementing low-cost, leading-edge recycling and building technologies (Ubuntu-Blox), this project will create a Recycling and Eco-Training Center out of compressed plastic blocks and become a catalyst in the region for transforming problematic waste into vital building resources and job opportunities.  </span></p>
<p><b>This ground breaking project, beginning at one of the most treasured yet impoverished cities in the world, addresses a truly global issue, is<b> highly scalable, and is being developed and evaluated for rippling global impact. </b></b></p>
<p><b><b>With your support, this initiative </b>will not only clean up, create jobs and make a greener Bodh Gaya, but will also be a model to inspire and educate other communities in need of appropriate waste solutions around the world. </b></p>
<p><b>THANK YOU FOR YOUR VITAL PARTICIPATION!!</b></p>

<h3><b>The Problem</b></h3>
<p>The large number of tourists that come through Bodh Gaya each year and the lack of any recycling system results in endemic plastic pollution that plagues local economy, health, and environment of Bodh Gaya, villagers and tourists alike. Local children of the Dalit (lower caste) villages work through the night and lack educational opportunities or options for sustainable livelihoods. The health of the local ecology is also suffering greatly, and only continues to deteriorate.  Let's get plastic out of our water ways!</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/118745/files/20131007133238-Plastic_Pollution.jpg?1381177958"" src="""" style=""width: 454.66666666666663px; height: 341px;""/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>The Solution</b></h3>
<p>We have discovered a brilliant, low-cost way to turn this problem into a leading-edge solution by utilizing the plastic waste and compressing it into blocks that can be used as a medium for sustainable building construction!</p>
<p>Plastic waste is collected, cleaned, recycled, and then compressed into blocks to be used as building blocks. This proven appropriate technology solution pioneered in Haiti transforms this waste into a valuable resource. </p>
<p>Past Research Proves:</p>
<ul>
<li>The method of construction with the plastic blocks is earthquake resistance to scale of 8.3</li>
<li>Can withstand winds of up to 70mph</li>
<li>Has high insulation properties</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/118751/files/20131007133429-compressed_plastic_building.png?1381178069"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em;""/><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>Recycling and Training Center </b></h3>
<p>The technology opportunity driving this project is a leading-edge, low cost building method, known as Ubuntu-Blox, developed in Texas and tested in Haiti. Centered in the heart of Bodh Gaya to provide ongoing vocational and sustainability education, the Recycling and Training Center will become a focal point for resolving the detrimental plastic pollution problem locally in Bodh Gaya, and be a demonstration model for local, regional, and international communities.</p>
<p>Once initial seed funding is in place, the Recycling and Training Center will be established as a hub to collects and recycles plastic from the city and turns it into blocks that will be distributed and sold to support ongoing education programs.  The plastic building blocks can be used for construction of public toilets, roads, walls, benches, and other community needs. This reduces the need for other higher cost and less sustainable building materials such as bricks, cement, and lumber, while creating more sustainable livelihoods for local villagers.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<h3><b>Vocational Training</b></h3>
<p>The Recycling and Eco-Training Center will also offer vocational trainings, job opportunities, and community service programs. Educational programs will include training locals on the recycled plastic block construction technologies; sustainability and permaculture design trainings; water, waste, energy, and other appropriate technologies; Seven Stages to Sustainability Community Development, and other vocational trainings such as sowing, arts, crafts, and more. The Center will also host community programs like the Village Woman's Program, the Recycling Program, the Tree Planting Program, and more. These programs will be offered for local people including local men, women, children, and youths, and for international visitors alike. The Center will also sell locally produced goods created by the local artisans and villagers.</p>
<h3><b>Impact &amp; Outcomes</b></h3>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Building a Recycling Center to address the on-going plastic issues</li>
<li>Cleaning the plastic pollution in Bod Ghaya and beautifying the city</li>
<li>Developing cutting-edge sustainable building technologies</li>
<li>Providing educational and vocational trainings</li>
<li>Creating and supporting local sustainable livelihoods</li>
<li>Engaging local, national and international partners</li>
</ul><p>As the project grows, we will be inviting community stakeholders and NGO's from all around the Himalayan region, India, other countries to learn these leading-edge recycling and building technologies, as well as other sustainability techniques and practices, which they can take back to implement in their respective regions.</p>
<h1><b>Phases</b></h1>
<h3><b>Phase 1 - Materials Construction &amp; Design: $25k</b></h3>
<p>In order to get this project off the ground, we need $25k of seed money. These funds will allow us to complete the foundational steps of gathering the raw plastic materials, purchasing the compression machine, constructing the plastic blocks, and completing the design to be ready for the building construction. Throughout this process we will enroll and coordinate local villagers in a large scale gathering of plastic pollution from all over Bodh Gaya. A team of local community villagers will also be trained in the process of constructing the plastic blocks for the construction of the Recycling &amp; Eco-Training Center Building.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<h3><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Phase 2 - Construction of the Building: $50k</b></h3>
<p>Any additional funds we receive beyond the minimum $25k will go towards the construction of the Eco-Center Building. In Phase 2 of the project, trained local villagers proficient in the plastic block building method will utilize the plastic blocks to build the Recycling and Eco-Training Center building. This building will house the Sacred Earth Trust office, a Solar powered I.T. Centre, and a Training Room.</p>

  The ProjectThe treasured UNESCO world heritage site of Bodh Gaya - the place of the Buddha’s Enlightenment - is plagued by enormous amounts of plastic pollution, among other challenges that threaten the local ecology, economy, & community.
Visited by thousands of Buddhists, Hindus, and tourists who come on spiritual pilgrimages from all over the world, Bodh Gaya is also home to a local village population of around 40,000 Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, and Christians. 
Bodh Gaya based NGO, Sacred Earth Trust, in collaboration with global Partners in Empowerment: Empowerment Works and Living Mandala, have teamed up with diverse members of the local community to transform Bodh Gaya's plastic pollution problem into a sustainable building solution for the region. 
Through implementing low-cost, leading-edge recycling and building technologies (Ubuntu-Blox), this project will create a Recycling and Eco-Training Center out of compressed plastic blocks and become a catalyst in the region for transforming problematic waste into vital building resources and job opportunities.  
This ground breaking project, beginning at one of the most treasured yet impoverished cities in the world, addresses a truly global issue, is highly scalable, and is being developed and evaluated for rippling global impact. 
With your support, this initiative will not only clean up, create jobs and make a greener Bodh Gaya, but will also be a model to inspire and educate other communities in need of appropriate waste solutions around the world. 
THANK YOU FOR YOUR VITAL PARTICIPATION!!




The Problem
The large number of tourists that come through Bodh Gaya each year and the lack of any recycling system results in endemic plastic pollution that plagues local economy, health, and environment of Bodh Gaya, villagers and tourists alike. Local children of the Dalit (lower caste) villages work through the night and lack educational opportunities or options for sustainable livelihoods. The health of the local ecology is also suffering greatly, and only continues to deteriorate.  Let's get plastic out of our water ways!




The Solution
We have discovered a brilliant, low-cost way to turn this problem into a leading-edge solution by utilizing the plastic waste and compressing it into blocks that can be used as a medium for sustainable building construction!
Plastic waste is collected, cleaned, recycled, and then compressed into blocks to be used as building blocks. This proven appropriate technology solution pioneered in Haiti transforms this waste into a valuable resource. 
Past Research Proves:

The method of construction with the plastic blocks is earthquake resistance to scale of 8.3
Can withstand winds of up to 70mph
Has high insulation properties



Recycling and Training Center 
The technology opportunity driving this project is a leading-edge, low cost building method, known as Ubuntu-Blox, developed in Texas and tested in Haiti. Centered in the heart of Bodh Gaya to provide ongoing vocational and sustainability education, the Recycling and Training Center will become a focal point for resolving the detrimental plastic pollution problem locally in Bodh Gaya, and be a demonstration model for local, regional, and international communities.
Once initial seed funding is in place, the Recycling and Training Center will be established as a hub to collects and recycles plastic from the city and turns it into blocks that will be distributed and sold to support ongoing education programs.  The plastic building blocks can be used for construction of public toilets, roads, walls, benches, and other community needs. This reduces the need for other higher cost and less sustainable building materials such as bricks, cement, and lumber, while creating more sustainable livelihoods for local villagers.



Vocational Training
The Recycling and Eco-Training Center will also offer vocational trainings, job opportunities, and community service programs. Educational programs will include training locals on the recycled plastic block construction technologies; sustainability and permaculture design trainings; water, waste, energy, and other appropriate technologies; Seven Stages to Sustainability Community Development, and other vocational trainings such as sowing, arts, crafts, and more. The Center will also host community programs like the Village Woman's Program, the Recycling Program, the Tree Planting Program, and more. These programs will be offered for local people including local men, women, children, and youths, and for international visitors alike. The Center will also sell locally produced goods created by the local artisans and villagers.
Impact & Outcomes


Building a Recycling Center to address the on-going plastic issues
Cleaning the plastic pollution in Bod Ghaya and beautifying the city
Developing cutting-edge sustainable building technologies
Providing educational and vocational trainings
Creating and supporting local sustainable livelihoods
Engaging local, national and international partners
As the project grows, we will be inviting community stakeholders and NGO's from all around the Himalayan region, India, other countries to learn these leading-edge recycling and building technologies, as well as other sustainability techniques and practices, which they can take back to implement in their respective regions.
Phases
Phase 1 - Materials Construction & Design: $25k
In order to get this project off the ground, we need $25k of seed money. These funds will allow us to complete the foundational steps of gathering the raw plastic materials, purchasing the compression machine, constructing the plastic blocks, and completing the design to be ready for the building construction. Throughout this process we will enroll and coordinate local villagers in a large scale gathering of plastic pollution from all over Bodh Gaya. A team of local community villagers will also be trained in the process of constructing the plastic blocks for the construction of the Recycling & Eco-Training Center Building.



Phase 2 - Construction of the Building: $50k
Any additional funds we receive beyond the minimum $25k will go towards the construction of the Eco-Center Building. In Phase 2 of the project, trained local villagers proficient in the plastic block building method will utilize the plastic blocks to build the Recycling and Eco-Training Center building. This building will house the Sacred Earth Trust office, a Solar powered I.T. Centre, and a Training Room.



Phase 3 - Solar Powered IT Center, Greenhouse, Greenhouse, & Compost Toilets: $75k
Any funds we receive beyond $50k will go towards Phase 3 of the project, which is transforming the Eco-Center into a model sustainability demonstration site including:

Solar Powered Energy
Furnished IT Center 
Year Round Community Garden
Compost toilets
Medicinal Plant & Tea Production Green House
Rooftop Food Garden

I have been accepted to travel with a Witness for Peace delegation (basically, an educational trip--I’m such a nerd!) from September 14-24, 2014.In addition to building bridges of solidarity between the Cuban and American people, this trip will be a great opportunity for me to further my education in a hands-on way and provide experience for me that will contribute to my long-term vocational goals. And as a photographer for the team, I’ll be documenting the entire trip as our group travels and learns together.I'm inviting all of you to come along for the ride! Whether you know all about Cuba's history, or whether you just know about Fidel Castro, get an inside look at the island and people of Cuba as I share my reflections and photographs along the way. Some donations have been received in person. Final Update 8/8/14More Details I traveled to Latin America for the first time when I was just barely in high school (16 years ago--but that’s just between you and me!). Although I was barely able to communicate with the little Spanish that I knew, there was something deeper that drew my heart and connected me to the Latin American people that I met.Since then, I’ve had some amazing opportunities to work, study, share the love of God, photograph, and travel throughout Latin America. I’ve learned much more Spanish, met a lot of wonderful people, and contemplated the difficulties and complex problems that my friends in those countries face. One thing has remained and only grown deeper over that time: my love and passion for the people of Latin America.I'm very excited to be joining with others on this Witness for Peace delegation as we explore and seek to learn more about Cuba.Witness for Peace is a politically independent grassroots organization committed to nonviolence.  Since 1983 they have worked to support peace, justice, and sustainable economies in Latin America and the Caribbean by changing U.S. policies and corporate practices that contribute to poverty and oppression.   What Will I Be Doing?One of the most important things that Witness for Peace does to educate people in the US about Latin America is to organize travel delegations. During the delegation to Cuba, our group will visit schools at all levels to meet with Cuban citizens, scholars, musicians, and members of organizations to understand how Cuba’s history has shaped modern life for Cubans. We will also meet people in the countryside to learn about what they are experiencing, to document the impact of current US policies there, and to report our perspectives to the U.S. Interests Sections Office in Havana. 
The Impact
Since the Cuban Revolution more than 50 years ago, Cubans and US citizens have been separated by various policies enacted by our governments. Cuba is only 90 miles away from Florida, and yet there is so much distance between our countries and our citizens. I believe that the more we can connect at a grassroots level, the more we can learn about each other and understand how we can move forward into more peaceful relations.What I Need & How You Can HelpIn order for me to be able to go, I'm asking for the help of my friends, family, and community (or benevolent strangers!). If you are someone who likes this project and has the means to contribute, it would mean so much to me to be to have your support. Every gift helps--even if it's only $1! Can you help me reach my goal? 
In order to participate in this trip, I need to raise about $2,200 by August 10, 2014.  
These funds will cover travel to and from Cuba, as well as all in-country costs.  Trip costs = $1755  Flight from Miami to Cuba = $450 Flight from my hometown to Miami will be covered by my frequent flier miles. I've already paid $150 toward the deposit with excess funds raised from my humanitarian photography trip to Guatemala in 2012, but I have left the funding goal at $2200 to cover fees and perks for this site. 
If I raise more than enough funds, they will be set aside to fund future humanitarian photography trips and service opportunities.
  Other Ways You Can HelpI know that not everyone can give, but I sincerely, from the bottom of my heart, genuinely, appreciate your support in other ways:
I would love, love, love it if you would share this campaign with your friends, family, and social network. You can easily share this page on facebook, twitter, or email by clicking one of the share buttons below the video or just copying and pasting the link.

Keep me in your prayers! I want to sharpen my Spanish, be able to connect and build relationships, learn, and stay safe!

<p> My name is Angela, I am an Aussie currently living in Mexico for a year<span>. I want to raise money for two very sweet Mexican children I know to go to school (well child and teenager to be politically correct).</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p><span>Teresa is 14 and has been out of school for two years. Her parents were simply unable to pay the school fees, uniform, materials, transport etc and all the costs that come with school. Teresa wants to be a teacher one day. </span></p>
<p><span>Juan Pablo, 6 received a scholarship last year to go to school, he loves school, but was unable to get a scholarship this year and their parents have been unable to pay school fees and all the extra school costs.</span></p>
</div>
<div><span>Because Teresa has missed two years of school she can't go to her local secondary school, but we have found a remedial open secondary school in the city, run the the local government, which is free (yay). The school is called CROC Secondary. I went with her Mother to get her enrolled and the school looks awesome and Teresa is super excited.</span></div>
<div><span> </span></div>
<div><span>Juan Pablo will be going to his local public school, Patria Nueva Primaria. </span></div>
<div>
<div>
<p><span>Inspired by the world of Mother Teresa, “If you can't feed a hundred people, then just feed one.” I am going to try to help this beautiful family to send heir children to school. While I would love to get every single child in Mexico (let alone a 100) off the streets and into school and I focusing and helping these two children very close to my heart. </span></p>
</div>
<div><span>I meet their Mother sweet Lupita or Lupita Princessita as I call her, in 2008 on my first visit to Mexico. Lupita works as a maid and gets paid anywhere from $150 - $200pesos ($10.35 - $13.80) for a 10 hour day. Obviously when she is sick or the kids there is no sick pay, no holiday pay, no medical insurance etc. You get the picture. </span></div>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Teresa's school Croc Secondary has free dress there is no uniform and thus I wanted to make sure she had some new clothes to start school feeling confidant. As clothes here in Mexico are very expensive and cost the same as they do in the US, Teresa and Juan get new clothes once in a blue moon and almost all of her clothes and her shoes are all second hand. We now how self-esteems effects how well you do at school, so let's give her a self esteem a big boost. <span><br/></span>

<p>My name is Sam and I am a 28-year-old cancer survivor. I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer at the age of 18. As a young adult survivor, I found cancer &amp; nutrition resources hard to come by and support groups hard to relate to.  Those resources I did find I still look to and utilize today, ten years later.  </p>
<h3>What Do I Want To Accomplish?</h3>
<p>I want to participate in a culinary nutrition certification.  My big end goal is to use what I learn to help cancer survivors and their families introduce more whole foods into their diets to help heal their bodies (and prevent future disease).  I want to break things down as simply as I can and give these individual easy and meaningful ways they can make changes when it comes to nutrition.</p>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>Cancer survivors are often named as one of the most motivated groups when it comes to taking charge of their health and being their own healthcare advocates - during and after treatment.  We are likely to seek out more alternative treatments (whole food nutrition, acupuncture, herbal medicine, etc.) to add to our treatment plans. Over the last 10 years, I've thrown myself into research and done my best to find my way through the maze that is cancer diagnosis and treatment. Not to mention the big question marks surrounding life AFTER cancer. Finding resources and support from people you can connect with and relate to can be overwhelming. I want to help make that process easier. <strong> This month I am celebrating 6 years cancer-free. What better way to celebrate than to pay it forward to other cancer survivors?</strong> </p>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>A cancer diagnosis, treatment plans and our healthcare system are difficult enough to navigate.  By the time a survivor makes it to the grocery or health food store they may feel completely overwhelmed.  I want donate my time and knowledge to help these individuals make whole food choices that will work with lifestyles and help them heal their bodies.  <strong>I hope to work with local cancer support organizations to help reach survivors and their families.  I would LOVE to donate some of my time to work locally with individuals, in workshop settings, and maybe even take things to Skype to reach those outside of the Baltimore area. No cost to them.</strong></p>
</div>
<h3><strong>About The Certification</strong></h3>
<p>The program is offered by <a href=""http://www.meghantelpner.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Meghan Telpner</a>, a Toronto-based nutritionist and author.  She has been an invaluable resource and teacher in my cancer journey and I want to continue my education under her leadership and guidance. The certification involves over 200 hours of training over 12 weeks, starting in September 2013. It includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lecture &amp; real-time instructional workshops focused on creating meal plans &amp; recipes, foods for healing, eating for energy, blending &amp; juicing, elixirs &amp; herbal medicines, gluten-free diets, fermentation, knife skills, living/raw food, cooking for kids, and natural beauty care (among other topics).</li>
<li>Home study/practice focusing on developing meal plans in accordance with certain dietary restrictions, recipe development &amp; testing, client simulations, and hosting cooking classes/workshops.</li>
<li>Independent research &amp; required reading.</li>
<li>Community &amp; practical skills development: attending and volunteering at community food related events/lectures, 20 co-op hours working with food-related organizations.</li>
</ul><div>
<h3>What I Need To Reach My Goal</h3>
<ul>
<li>$2,200 Tuition</li>
<li>$400 Books &amp; kitchen supplies</li>
<li>$300 Ingredients for recipe testing &amp; creation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TOTAL: $2,900</strong></p>
<h3>If I Am Lucky Enough To Surpass My Goal</h3>
<p>The $2,900 is the bare minimum I will need to participate in this program. If we happen to go above and beyond the goal (EEEEEEE!), any additional funds will be spent in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Indiegogo and Paypal campaign fees (est. $200).</li>
<li>Printing &amp; Shipping of all perks (est. $400).</li>
<li>The purchase of ingredients and supplies to be used in group workshops and one-on-one culinary nutrition sessions with cancer survivors. <strong>No cost to them.</strong>

</div></div>","About Me
My name is Sam and I am a 28-year-old cancer survivor. I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer at the age of 18. As a young adult survivor, I found cancer & nutrition resources hard to come by and support groups hard to relate to.  Those resources I did find I still look to and utilize today, ten years later.  
What Do I Want To Accomplish?
I want to participate in a culinary nutrition certification.  My big end goal is to use what I learn to help cancer survivors and their families introduce more whole foods into their diets to help heal their bodies (and prevent future disease).  I want to break things down as simply as I can and give these individual easy and meaningful ways they can make changes when it comes to nutrition.
Why?
Cancer survivors are often named as one of the most motivated groups when it comes to taking charge of their health and being their own healthcare advocates - during and after treatment.  We are likely to seek out more alternative treatments (whole food nutrition, acupuncture, herbal medicine, etc.) to add to our treatment plans. Over the last 10 years, I've thrown myself into research and done my best to find my way through the maze that is cancer diagnosis and treatment. Not to mention the big question marks surrounding life AFTER cancer. Finding resources and support from people you can connect with and relate to can be overwhelming. I want to help make that process easier.  This month I am celebrating 6 years cancer-free. What better way to celebrate than to pay it forward to other cancer survivors? 

The Impact


A cancer diagnosis, treatment plans and our healthcare system are difficult enough to navigate.  By the time a survivor makes it to the grocery or health food store they may feel completely overwhelmed.  I want donate my time and knowledge to help these individuals make whole food choices that will work with lifestyles and help them heal their bodies.  I hope to work with local cancer support organizations to help reach survivors and their families.  I would LOVE to donate some of my time to work locally with individuals, in workshop settings, and maybe even take things to Skype to reach those outside of the Baltimore area. No cost to them.

About The Certification
The program is offered by Meghan Telpner, a Toronto-based nutritionist and author.  She has been an invaluable resource and teacher in my cancer journey and I want to continue my education under her leadership and guidance. The certification involves over 200 hours of training over 12 weeks, starting in September 2013. It includes:

Lecture & real-time instructional workshops focused on creating meal plans & recipes, foods for healing, eating for energy, blending & juicing, elixirs & herbal medicines, gluten-free diets, fermentation, knife skills, living/raw food, cooking for kids, and natural beauty care (among other topics).
Home study/practice focusing on developing meal plans in accordance with certain dietary restrictions, recipe development & testing, client simulations, and hosting cooking classes/workshops.
Independent research & required reading.
Community & practical skills development: attending and volunteering at community food related events/lectures, 20 co-op hours working with food-related organizations.

What I Need To Reach My Goal

$2,200 Tuition
$400 Books & kitchen supplies
$300 Ingredients for recipe testing & creation

TOTAL: $2,900
If I Am Lucky Enough To Surpass My Goal
The $2,900 is the bare minimum I will need to participate in this program. If we happen to go above and beyond the goal (EEEEEEE!), any additional funds will be spent in the following ways:

Indiegogo and Paypal campaign fees (est. $200).
Printing & Shipping of all perks (est. $400).
The purchase of ingredients and supplies to be used in group workshops and one-on-one culinary nutrition sessions with cancer survivors. No cost to them.

Our Need
A study commissioned by Crawford in 2007 highlights many of the deficiencies that continue to make teaching and learning more challenging for students and staff. The study, conducted by engineering firm, Kleinfeldt Consultants Limited, noted that “the building is generally at or over-capacity in terms of storage space, class size and parking”.
Structural Problems

Supply and return air ventilation system needs to be upgraded
Plumbing system is aged and needs a complete overhaul
Roof is constantly leaking
Heating system is deficient, constantly breaking down and continuously being serviced

Our Goal 
Our goal is to build a state of the art facility to service our students, faculty, parents and community.  


The Impact
A new facility would bring added value to our school and the community at large:

Our new facility will be wheel-chair accessible
A state-of-the-art learning centre for learning-disabled children
Larger gyms to accommodate the separation of student age groups and wider community usage
Dedicated weight room which will be accessible to the community

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Doosha Friends and Family. Most of you know my daughter Selena Finley, she is 13 years old and in seventh grade at Valley Middle School. She is an enrolled member of the Mandan, Hidatsa, Arikara Nation and a descendant of the Spirit Lake Dakota and Standing Rock Lakota through her maternal great-grandmother.She has been accepted to the People to People Ambassador Program! So what does this mean? She is one of only 3 students from Grand Forks that will be traveling to Europe for 20 days this summer. She will be representing her family, her country, and her people on this momentous journey. As some of you may know, Selena and I have opened our home to my sister's 5 children, who have been staying with us for just under a year. As you can imagine this has been a huge undertaking for our family and leaves us with little to spare at the end of each month. We are asking for your help on this endeavor, as many of you have impacted Selena's life in some way and have helpedto shape her into the wonderful young woman she has become and will continue to grow into.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The People to People Ambassador Program has been sending students from America all over the world for almost 50 years. The delegation that Selena will be traveling to Europe for 20 days. While most of us may think ""woo hoo, Euro Trip!"" Selena's delegation will be participating in a very ambitious and vigorous schedule. Some of the things they will be doing include: Meeting a member of the Brittish Parliament in London, England; Visiting the Normandy American Cemetary and Memorial in Caen, France; taking in The Louvre art museum in Paris, France; taking in the city of Bruge, Belgium; biking through Amsterdam, Netherlands; cruising the Rhine River in Cologne, Germany; exploring castle ruins in Heidelberg, Germany; conducting a civil service project in the famous Black Forest of Freiburg, Germany; and riding the rapids of Inn River of Scuol, Switzerland. While Selena will be gaining a wealth of knowledge from this experience, she will also be sharing her knowledge with the many students she will be meeting on this trip. She has much to offer, especially her rich Native American heritage as she represents the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Lakota of North Dakota. This trip is truly a once in a lifetime opportunity for Selena and I feel that it will have a major impact on her world view, and her future life goals. This opportunity is one that I cannot offer to her alone and this is why it is important that we gain your support on this unique endeavor.<br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So here it is, in order for Selena to travel with the People to People Ambassador Program we need to raise a total of $6,899 minimum, that covers her flights, room and board, and insurance (just in case she gets sick or injured). This does not include: the passport fee, the luggage, supplies, or spending money, not to mention the trips to Fargo to attend the mandatory meetings with her delegation. Once we add those expenses in, we are looking at around $7,500. We have already put down a deposit and we are soliciting our tribe and local businesses for funding, but they are not guaranteed and we have not heard back yet from some of those sources. We anticipate being able to raise about $5,000 through those sources, but to be honest that has not been secured yet. This would leave us with at lest $2,500 to raise and that is our first goal through Indie GoGo. If this campaign is a sucess we will continue to raise money until she has to leave on the trip. I am also confident that we will be able to pull off at least two other fundraising events here in Grand Forks, so we will keep you posted.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We really want to get the word out, so please help us! We have created a facebook event page that we will keep updating as we progress and get ready to send Selena off. We would also like to have you email the link to this page to everyone you know, the more people the better! As we get any other media, we will make them available to you.</p>

Before the fights though, we want to help a few members in our community who are fighting a completely different battle.</p><ul>
<li>Alex Magdaleno, a personal trainer and avid marathon enthusiast, just recently started a new round of radiation therapy for paranasal sinus cancer, as well as continually battling chronic lymphoblastic leukemia. Members and staff at Elite worked and worked out with Alex, who gets out of bed and runs an ""easy seven miles"" when most of us would have thrown in the towel.</li>
<li>Tracey Baumann-Lilley is the mother of one of our very own fighters, Ryan Lilley. While many moms would worry about their son getting into a cage, she is Ryan's biggest fan. She was recently diagnosed with breast cancer, but has Ryan's fighting spirit, and will not be discouraged. She's faced her own fair share of struggles before, and since starting treatment in October, she has been facing chemotherapy like a true champion.</li>
</ul><p>We want to show these two incredible individuals that no one ever fights cancer alone.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>Even with the best health insurance, medical bills for cancer are insane! Our goal is to help Alex and Tracey lessen the financial burden they face:</p><ul>
<li>We've set a modest goal of $3,000, since we don't have much time before the show.</li>
<li>Whatever money is raised will be split evenly between Alex and Tracey.</li>
<li>By helping us meet our goal, you will receive some one of a kind items and experiences from Bas Rutten's Elite MMA Gym, from a reusable water bottle, to a month of training with Bas and our fighters, to signed posters from Bas himself!</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>Our Impact</h3><p>Cancer organizations are easy to find and easy to donate to, but this is a special case. We want YOU to know that your donation directly affects someone who is battling cancer. Help us give back to our friends and let them know that we are all in their corner!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Can't contribute financially? You can still help us out!!</p><ul>

Before the fights though, we want to help a few members in our community who are fighting a completely different battle.
Alex Magdaleno, a personal trainer and avid marathon enthusiast, just recently started a new round of radiation therapy for paranasal sinus cancer, as well as continually battling chronic lymphoblastic leukemia. Members and staff at Elite worked and worked out with Alex, who gets out of bed and runs an ""easy seven miles"" when most of us would have thrown in the towel.
Tracey Baumann-Lilley is the mother of one of our very own fighters, Ryan Lilley. While many moms would worry about their son getting into a cage, she is Ryan's biggest fan. She was recently diagnosed with breast cancer, but has Ryan's fighting spirit, and will not be discouraged. She's faced her own fair share of struggles before, and since starting treatment in October, she has been facing chemotherapy like a true champion.
We want to show these two incredible individuals that no one ever fights cancer alone.What We Need & What You GetEven with the best health insurance, medical bills for cancer are insane! Our goal is to help Alex and Tracey lessen the financial burden they face:
We've set a modest goal of $3,000, since we don't have much time before the show.
Whatever money is raised will be split evenly between Alex and Tracey.
By helping us meet our goal, you will receive some one of a kind items and experiences from Bas Rutten's Elite MMA Gym, from a reusable water bottle, to a month of training with Bas and our fighters, to signed posters from Bas himself!
Our ImpactCancer organizations are easy to find and easy to donate to, but this is a special case. We want YOU to know that your donation directly affects someone who is battling cancer. Help us give back to our friends and let them know that we are all in their corner!Other Ways You Can HelpCan't contribute financially? You can still help us out!!

<p><strong><img alt=""Every 26"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://company.upswi.ng/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Every-26-Seconds-box-e1373906814199.png"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p><strong>What is Upswing?</strong></p>
<p>Upswing in an online marketplace that allows all people (high school students, college students, interview candidates, and more) to connect with others in order to teach, guide, and mentor.  Here at Upswing we refer to experts, teachers, guiders, and mentors (the people giving knowledge) as “Coaches” because they coach others with regard to a specific subject matter.  The people who receive the information here at Upswing are called “Learners.”  </p>
<p>Upswing can be used to share information about all sorts of subjects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Academic tutoring</li>
<li>Standardized test preparation</li>
<li>Language lessons</li>
<li>Interview preparation</li>
<li>Legal consulting</li>
<li>Image consulting and basically any other type of teaching, guiding, or mentoring a Coach and Learner would like to exchange.  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What happens on Upswing?</strong></p>
<p>When a Learner comes onto our system, we initially ask a series of questions to understand how that person learns best (e.g., visually or through audio? Hour-long discussions or short 15-minute spurts?).</p>
<p>Based upon how the user answers, we match that Learner to a Coach who teaches that same way through our Learner-Coach Matching System (“LCMS”).  This increases the chance that Learners will actually learn what they seek to learn and find their sessions productive.  </p>
<p>Our LCMS also keeps track of what Learners have learned and done in their sessions.  This feature allows Coaches to get a sense of each Learners’ level and progress and thereby pick up exactly where the Learner left off in previous sessions whether it was with the same or a new Coach.  This will help maximize the efficiency of each session. </p>
<p>Upswing gives anyone struggling with a task or subject the ability to come onto our site and find the perfect coach right away, and then get the information they're looking for through our site. We also provide experts the ability to become coaches on our site, build their own knowledge-sharing business and provide their expertise online.  </p>
<p><strong>Does Upswing ONLY match Learners and Coaches?</strong></p>
<p>We do so much more than that. We have a virtual, real time, interactive white board that Coaches and Learners can both see and write on.  We also allow Coaches and Learners to instant message each other, speak to each other and even video chat with each other in a safe environment without having to meet in person or disclose their personal contact information. Finally, Learners can schedule future sessions with Coaches right there on our system.</p>
<p><strong>Why a marketplace?  Why online?</strong> </p>
<p>One of the best things about Upswing is that it is a marketplace. This means that Learners can come to one central online location to find Coaches marketing their services and interact with the Coaches that meet their needs.  Upswing does not specify what a Coach will charge or who a Learner must work with.  Instead, Upswing allows Learners to choose based upon their own preferences.  This also means that Coaches can set their own rates and hours and decide how much or how little knowledge sharing they want to provide.  They can make a full time job out of it, or do it in their spare time.  Coaches also get to build a name and reputation for themselves through Upswing’s recommendation and rating systems.  This gives Learners the ability to select the Coach that will be a best fit for them based on ratings, price, and other criteria they may prioritize.</p>
<p>By being online, Upswing enables knowledge-sharing to happen between Coaches and Learners all over the world.  If you need to write a term paper on Galapagos ecology, why not get a lesson on Galapagos ecology from a scientist studying in the Galapagos right now?! This is what we want to achieve with Upswing.</p>

<p><strong>Can Upswing help students and education?</strong></p>
<p>Yes!  Upswing brings on-demand tutoring to students online.  In addition, our Learner-Coach Matching System is particularly helpful with academic coaching for educational tutoring type users.  Traditional school students that receive academic tutoring on Upswing, for instance, will be able to easily present information about themselves, their history, progress, learning styles and preferences to their academic Coaches.  This will give these students increased efficiency and personalization in their tutoring sessions because their Coaches will have valuable insight as to how to best help these academic Learners achieve their goals and make sessions as productive as possible.</p>

<p><strong>Where did you get this idea?</strong></p>
<p>Well, for starters we love learning and we love sharing what we learn.  We want others to be able to have access to the knowledge and coaching that they need to meet their own personal, professtional, and educational goals.  On top of that, we’re all passionate about education and have personal goals to contribute toward closing the education gap and increasing access to education around the world.  Upswing can do just that – bring education and knowledge to people around the world who want to learn. It’s what drives us.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What have you done so far?</strong></p>
<p>Well……we’re glad you asked!  We’ve done a lot.  We created our first platform and used it in nearby public schools. We got great feedback from students and administrators and are happy to report that they love our concept.  We were one of only seven teams chosen out of 40 to present at Google last month.  We presented to almost 400 people.  We were also accepted into Groundwork Labs, a program for high potential, high growth tech-oriented start-ups. We are trying to get our platform into more schools, and, we’ve been hard at work on the next generation of our platform! It’s basically been a whirlwind here at Upswing and we wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>

<p><strong>Why Do You Need My Help?</strong></p>
<p>As you can see, we are trying to complete a <strong>monumental</strong> task, but it's a task we believe will transform education for hundreds of students.</p>
<p>With the money raised here, we will be able to continue working on our Learner-Coach Matching System. We will also be able to offer free tutoring to many students looking for that extra help!</p>
