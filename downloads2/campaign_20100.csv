<p>
</p><h2>Why We Need Your Help</h2>
<p>The thing is, Carla and Hannah do this as a job. We need to pay them, and we also have to cover expenses for costumes, props, technical equipment and a stage if we want to perform.

</h2>
<p><span>Founded by NY Comic Con in 2007, Apple Kissa—a NYC-based maid cafe-- has soared to new heights, influencing thousands of fans worldwide. Unfortunately, as NYCC begins phasing anime out of their con, we’ve lost our sponsorship and a large venue to perform. However, we now have the opportunity to call Rhode Island Comic Con home! As a group, we do not receive a dime for the shows we put on-- we do what we do because we love our fans. Please help us to continue entertaining geeks across the east coast and let us spread the message of love, magic, moe and anime!</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>For fans, by fans.</h2>
<p>The end of NY Comic Con sponsorship spelled doom for us at first. We were one of the first maid cafes to be developed in the United States. Still, even in the face of this hardship, we won't give up! Our goal has always been to put a smile on the faces of those who come to see us, dance with us, sing with us, play games with us. We have always loved each and every fan who has supported us in our journey to where we've gotten to today, and we're not about to let that end. Each of our members has worked incredibly hard, practicing dances every day, for almost 6 years now. We don't work for the promise of payment, just for the promise that we can spread moe cuteness as far as we can!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Why help us?</h2>
<p>Without your help, we won't be able to continue doing what we love most. As a NYC-based group, getting all the way up to Rhode Island isn't very cheap. Since we do not receive any payment for our efforts, getting to RICC would need to come entirely out of pocket and as most of us are only still in college, the expenses are too high for our budget.</p>
<p>Your contribution would do the following:</p>
<p>- Get every available maid a bus seat to and from Rhode Island.</p>
<p>- Give us the opportunity to continue performing in a new home.</p>
<p>- Allow us to gain exposure to a new crowd, who we are sure we can win the hearts of~</p>
<p>- Afford us the opportunity to spearhead Rhode Island Comic Con's new venture into anime for the first time!</p></div>","We are Apple Kissa.

<p><strong>My Story</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is Alexander Komarov. I moved to the states in 2007 from Russia. I attended Santa Monica College where I graduated with my degree in Theatre. During my time in college i played roles like Lord Farquaad in Shrek, The Musical, Dr. Carrasco in Man of LaMancha and Boris Kolenkhov in You Can't Take It With You.</p>
<p> I have been involved in the theatre arts since I was 14 years old. I was introduced to ""Charley's Aunt, The Musical"" in 2005 when I  did a production of it myself. I got the chance to meet Victor Sytnik who originated the leading role of Babbs Babberley and became friends with him. When I  was moving to the US, I promised Victor that one day I would produce this show in the States. </p>
<p>By contributing to this fund you will help me achieve my dream to bring this show to life in the States. And to introduce American audiences to music composed by Oscar Feltsman and lyrics by  Robert Rozhdestvensky. These two stage readings are just the beginning. My dream goal is to bring this to Broadway. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Are Looking For</strong> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are looking to raise $8,500. </p>
<p>The money you contribute goes to The Zephyr Theatre for rehearsals, and the two stage readings. Your donations will pay for our director, musical director, actors, lighting and sound. </p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal. We will still do our best to create two stage readings of Charley's Aunt with the funds that we have raised. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The World Needs More Comedy</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I've seen the audience reactions form the original production and the production I've performed in. Their reactions were priceless. This show brought them so much joy and laughter. The world needs more comedy, more fun, more farce, more laughter and Charley's Aunt, the Musical delivers that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Having problems donating?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>No problem. We could really use your help to get the word out about this campaign. Please share on social media. By word-of-mouth, or via email? If you have any friends that would be interested in this kind of theater, please let them know! Thank you </p>

Since then, I’ve come a long way practicing through all sorts of performance; dance, musicals and traditional theater to realize, that I am striving to be an artist who’s honored to feel responsible for exposing, and inviting people to experience human intimacy, shame, fear, and give space for the untold stories and the stories that never get a chance to be told.</p><p><strong>What is Void?</strong></p><p>Void is an exploration of the female body: how it occupies space and how it has been existing throughout history.</p><p>What if the women in mythology, fairy tales, tragedies, biblical texts cross paths through memories marked by blood?</p><p>Void is about unleashing the female memory: how the rigid traditions, countless rituals, shame, guilt, and fear have left their marks on our bodies and souls.</p><p>This piece will be a movement based exploration of historical female figures and their impact.

We are extremely excited as a company for such an opportunity!Who am I?Right from the heart of Istanbul, since the age of 4, I’ve been wanting and needing the stage.I’ve always loved expressing, reflecting, sensing, and entertaining with my being since I’ve known myself.I realized at a very early age that, my heart beats in a very particular way when I am performing. Since then, I’ve come a long way practicing through all sorts of performance; dance, musicals and traditional theater to realize, that I am striving to be an artist who’s honored to feel responsible for exposing, and inviting people to experience human intimacy, shame, fear, and give space for the untold stories and the stories that never get a chance to be told.What is Void?Void is an exploration of the female body: how it occupies space and how it has been existing throughout history.What if the women in mythology, fairy tales, tragedies, biblical texts cross paths through memories marked by blood?Void is about unleashing the female memory: how the rigid traditions, countless rituals, shame, guilt, and fear have left their marks on our bodies and souls.This piece will be a movement based exploration of historical female figures and their impact. We seek to expose phenomena of all cultures, both celebrating and hiding the female body, in order to reclaim, rethink, reevaluate the female energy and its impact.Full CreditsCreator & Director// Cemre Su SalurChoreographer // Yolette Yellow DukeLight Design // Victoria BainScenic Design // Ahmet DurustVideo Design & Graphic Design // Asli TunamanSound Design // Sasha HawkinsPerformers // Delaine Dobbs, Marsha Pierre, Alexandra Montalbano, Sydney Shinnick and Jessica CristWhy do we need this campaign?

<p><i>Macbeth</i> is Shakespeare's shortest tragedy.

<h2><strong>Not Your Stepmother's Cinderella...</strong></h2>
<p>You know the fairy tale: A beautiful young woman put to task by her wicked stepmother, true love discovered at a Royal Ball, a handsome prince to the rescue... but you've <em>NEVER</em> seen it like this. Curtain Call Performing Arts brings the science and fantasy of ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Steampunk</a>"" to the classic Rodgers and Hammerstein coming-of-age story, resulting in a feast for the eyes and ears in this highly-anticipated show.</p>
<p>The show is being directed by Misty Megia and produced by Andrea Gorham. Performances will be on August 24, 25, 26, 30 31 at the Center for the Arts in Castro Valley, CA.</p>
<h2>""In Our Own Little Corner""</h2>
<p>A little about Curtain Call Performing Arts: founded in 2008 by Andrea Gorham and Catherine Heck, CCPA brings the magic of Broadway to the San Francisco Bay Area. Our mainstage performances have included <em>Aida</em> (2009-Best Cast In The Bay <em>San Francisco Examiner)</em>, <em>Into the Woods</em> (2010-Most Visually Stunning and Best Cast, <em>San Francisco Examiner</em>) and <em>Seussical</em> (2011), as well as an annual performance of <em>A Christmas Carol</em>. Our mission: to produce exceptional theater. Our vision: to ensure that performance-based arts are accessible to everyone who desires to participate by keeping ticket prices low and offering affordable classes and workshops. We pride ourselves on being able to offer free showings of our mainstage productions to the San Leandro School District and putting on classroom workshops for students and teachers. As of May 2012, we've introduced 8000 students to the magic and wonder of musical theater through our <em>Gift of Broadway</em> program.</p>
<h2><strong>Help Us Get to the Ball!</strong></h2>
<p>We’re looking to raise $5500 that will be put toward venue rental, royalties, and costumes - every little bit helps! (And it can’t hurt that each sponsorship comes with a perk!) We know the power of word of mouth, so simply spreading our campaign around to your friends would be a tremendous benefit!</p>

<p style=""""><font color=""#3c3c3c""><font><font size=""4"">We are putting on a benefit production of <i>The Laramie Project</i>, the story of Matthew Shepard. He was a 21-year-old college student who was beaten and left for dead tied to a fence in Laramie, Wyoming on October 6, 1998 all because he was gay. This production is one of the most powerful plays ever written and has the greatest effect on everyone who experiences it.</font></font></font></p>
<p style=""""><font color=""#3c3c3c""><font><font size=""4"">The organization presenting this specific performance is Interweave, the LGBT committee with The 4<sup>th</sup> Universalist Society of New York on 76<sup>th</sup> and Central Park West. The proceeds of the production are being split between Interweave and The Matthew Shepard Foundation.</font></font></font></p>
<p style=""""><font color=""#3c3c3c""><font><font size=""4"">Our production will run for 3 weekends (on 76<sup>th</sup> &amp; Central Park West on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and in Harlem at The Democracy Charter Prep School on 133<sup>rd</sup> St.)</font></font></font></p>
<p style=""""><br/><br/></p>
<p style=""""><font color=""#3c3c3c""><font><font size=""4"" style=""font-size: 16pt;""><b style=""font-weight: bolder;"">The Impact</b></font></font></font></p>
<p style=""""><font color=""#3c3c3c""><font><font size=""4"">This play has been performed for more than 50 million people around the country over the last decade. The message of the play not only raises awareness, it teaches tolerance, acceptance, anti-hate mentality and changes lives around the world. Ignorance breeds hate. If one specific group of people are allowed to be targeted in a community, the door is open for all other groups to become victims of hate crimes. This play shows the impact one hate crime had on one community which can be multiplied by hundreds of thousands, though the intention of this production is to diminish those numbers, dramatically.</font></font></font></p>
<p style=""""><font color=""#3c3c3c""><font><font size=""4"">Ultimately, to bring the number of hate crimes reported around the country to <u>zero</u>.</font></font></font></p>

Our Story
We are putting on a benefit production of The Laramie Project, the story of Matthew Shepard. He was a 21-year-old college student who was beaten and left for dead tied to a fence in Laramie, Wyoming on October 6, 1998 all because he was gay. This production is one of the most powerful plays ever written and has the greatest effect on everyone who experiences it.
The organization presenting this specific performance is Interweave, the LGBT committee with The 4th Universalist Society of New York on 76th and Central Park West. The proceeds of the production are being split between Interweave and The Matthew Shepard Foundation.
Our production will run for 3 weekends (on 76th & Central Park West on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and in Harlem at The Democracy Charter Prep School on 133rd St.)

The Impact
This play has been performed for more than 50 million people around the country over the last decade. The message of the play not only raises awareness, it teaches tolerance, acceptance, anti-hate mentality and changes lives around the world. Ignorance breeds hate. If one specific group of people are allowed to be targeted in a community, the door is open for all other groups to become victims of hate crimes. This play shows the impact one hate crime had on one community which can be multiplied by hundreds of thousands, though the intention of this production is to diminish those numbers, dramatically.
Ultimately, to bring the number of hate crimes reported around the country to zero.

What We Need & What You Get
We are working to raise $3,000 to cover our basic production costs for the play. The money will cover building a stage-in-the-round, and muti-use bar set piece, chairs, renting sound/lighting equipment for the 3 weekends and printing costs as well as refreshments for the nights of the performances.
We have been doing our best to get donations, provide our own costumes/props, and keep all costs low. We artists know how to get creative! :)
If we are not able to meet our goal of $3,000 we will have to use the proceed money collected from ticket sales to cover these production costs. Of course this is not ideal since this is a benefit performance and we want to raise as much money as possible for our 2 beneficiaries, The Matthew Shepard Foundation and Interweave (the church's LGBT organization).

We'd like to show our appreciation with some great PERKS for your generosity!!
THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Our original musical, <i>The Incredible Six Thousand-Foot Ladder to Heaven</i>, was selected by a panel of judges to receive its world premiere production at Underscore Theatre's 2019 Chicago Musical Theatre Festival, running at The Edge Theatre February 4-24th. We've raised funds for the production and hired a first-rate cast and creative team. Now all that's left is to get our show up in front of an audience. That's where you come in.</p>
<p>We hope that our show is for everybody. But some people have a harder time getting to the theatre than others. Will you buy a ticket to our show so that a Chicago-area student can see this world premiere musical for free? Since this is an original pop/rock musical, younger people (such as...for example...Chicago-area students!) make up a crucial portion of our target audience. Getting more students in the audience gives us the opportunity to get valuable feedback on our show, while giving them an opportunity to see a production they might not have been able to see otherwise!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How It All Works</h3>
<p>It's a simple idea with a simple execution! You make a donation to this campaign, which we'll use to purchase and distribute tickets to Chicago-area students on a first-come-first-served basis. To spread the word, we'll advertise the exchange on college campuses and reach out to area high schools. Sign ups will be posted online so that everyone has fair and equal access to the tickets. Our producer will pay the platform and banking fees incurred by this campaign, which means that 100% of every dollar you spend goes toward buying a ticket for a Chicago-area student. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Here are some of the key ways your donation will make a difference:  </p>
<ul>
<li>A Chicago-area student gets to see our show at absolutely no cost to them! </li>
<li>Exposure to a broader cross section of people, especially this key portion of our target audience, helps us to develop our show for future productions. </li>
<li>All tickets bought before January 1st get us closer to unlocking additional performances for our run at the Chicago Musical Theatre Festival! More performances mean greater exposure for our show, as well as more funds we can raise towards producing a cast album! That cast album will in turn mean greater exposure for our show, and will form the basis of future submissions to theatre companies around the country. The best way to help us unlock these additional performances is by making your donation today!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Suggested Giving Levels</h3>
<p>Any amount helps! Here are some helpful tiers to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>$12.50 </strong>-- half a ticket. That may not sound like a lot, but consider this: it only takes 25 people giving at this level for us to reach a quarter of our goal! That's about 13 students in our audience who likely couldn't or wouldn't have been able to attended the show otherwise––that's awesome.</li>
<li>
<strong>$25</strong> -- one ticket. <u>This is our suggested donation</u>. All it takes is 50 people giving at this level for us to completely reach our goal. That means 50 Chicago-area students getting a chance to see this show at absolutely no cost to them!</li>
<li>
<strong>$100 </strong>-- Four tickets. If you're able and ~feeling the spirit~ then this is a really amazing tier at which to consider giving. A large gift like this helps get us closer to our overall goal, which could help to inspire more people to get involved with our campaign! </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Maybe you aren't in a position where you can make <span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>a monetary contribution to our ticket exchange. We totally get that! Here are some other ways you c</span>an<span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> help us out!</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Liking/favoriting our campaign on social media! Before people can give to our campaign, they need to be aware that it's happening! All it takes is one little ""like"" to increase our visibility online! </li>
<li>Sharing our campaign and encouraging others to get involved. Maybe you can't give, but chances are you know somebody who can! Encouraging other people to give even a modest amount is a huge help––every little bit adds up. </li>

That cast album will in turn mean greater exposure for our show, and will form the basis of future submissions to theatre companies around the country. The best way to help us unlock these additional performances is by making your donation today!


Suggested Giving Levels
Any amount helps! Here are some helpful tiers to consider:


$12.50 -- half a ticket. That may not sound like a lot, but consider this: it only takes 25 people giving at this level for us to reach a quarter of our goal! That's about 13 students in our audience who likely couldn't or wouldn't have been able to attended the show otherwise––that's awesome.

$25 -- one ticket. This is our suggested donation. All it takes is 50 people giving at this level for us to completely reach our goal. That means 50 Chicago-area students getting a chance to see this show at absolutely no cost to them!

$100 -- Four tickets. If you're able and ~feeling the spirit~ then this is a really amazing tier at which to consider giving. A large gift like this helps get us closer to our overall goal, which could help to inspire more people to get involved with our campaign! 


Other Ways You Can Help
Maybe you aren't in a position where you can make a monetary contribution to our ticket exchange. We totally get that! Here are some other ways you can help us out!

Liking/favoriting our campaign on social media! Before people can give to our campaign, they need to be aware that it's happening! All it takes is one little ""like"" to increase our visibility online! 
Sharing our campaign and encouraging others to get involved. Maybe you can't give, but chances are you know somebody who can! Encouraging other people to give even a modest amount is a huge help––every little bit adds up.

<span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span><span><p>One of the tricky things about the Fringe festival is that you are subject to any number of variables, from the space they put you in to the times your curtain goes up. <br/></p>
<p>We had an unexpected twist when Fringe gave us a wonderful space at Gallaudet University. We are so excited to have use of their captioning system and the opportunity to be accessible to the deaf community. Did you know that DC has the largest deaf community in the nation? </p>
<div>
<p></p>
<p>With this boon, however, comes new challenges. When Doorway Arts does something, we do it right. We want to be able to offer an ASL interpreter at multiple performances. This is an unexpected cost but we believe that it is worth every penny. </p>
<p>Any amount donated will go towards a new goal of providing an ASL interpreter for <i>Out of Sync</i>. If we go above and beyond that goal or do not quite reach it,  the proceeds will go towards paying a much deserved bonus to our artists. </p>
<p>We are so grateful to everyone who has donated, shared, and liked. Each and every one of you is responsible for our success. </p>
<p>Please continue to spread the word, we still have lots of neat perks and amazing set sculptures available and we aren't done yet!</p>

</h3><h3><span>Who Are We?</span></h3><p>I’m Mary Cat Gill,  the associate artistic director of Doorway Arts Theatre Company as well as a local artist with many other  hats. </p><p>I started this campaign to fund the production of an incredible new play, <i>Out of Sync</i>, as part of the 2015 Capital Fringe Festival. Our goal is to motivate a larger conversation about mental illness and encourage our audience to reconsider the secret lives of the people around them.</p><br/><h3></h3><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>By donating to this project, you will be aiding in the creation of a beautiful and relevant piece of art with a crucial message, supporting the mission of Doorway Arts to engage with local artists, including up-and-coming playwright Katie Woods and furthering the conversation about mental illness.</p><p>In order to mount this production, we will need your support. The financial costs of renting the theater space, mounting staging, and paying for the production of the play are large to a company of our size, but even one dollar adds up when many have pulled together.  Your donation will bring this play to reality.</p><br/><p></p><h2>Why this play?</h2><p>Last summer I had been tackling some of the questions around society and mental illness. Why do we embrace it as a media sensation, share in the tragedy of celebrity suicide or violent incident, then sweep it under rug when the mourning period had passed? Why do we keep skirting an issue that affects not just celebrities, but 1 in 5 Americans? It was around this time that I discovered Katie Woods’ play, <i>Out of Sync</i>, and was offered the challenge of a script that tackles the issues of depression and anxiety in a new way. A way that highlights the quiet struggles of one average person and how they create a ripple effect that shapes us all.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h2>What is it about?</h2><i>Out of Sync</i> follows Nathan and Petra, a young couple just beginning their relationship. But when the memories of his ex-girlfriend Amy start to bleed into the present, Nathan struggles to move forward. Amy’s crippling depression – and the devastation it eventually caused in their relationship – begins to splinter the fragile new bonds forming between Nathan and Petra. This beautiful new work e<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">xplores the fragile intersection between love and mental illness through text and movement. </span><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 38px; background-color: initial;"">Where does the money go?</span><br/></p><p>Even small donations go a long way. Here’s how we break down the budget. Our largest and most important expense is <b>paying our staff</b>. This show requires 3 actors, a dance choreographer, two designers, and a stage manager on top of the director and producer. To be able to pay everyone, that totals out to $900. Our second largest expense is <b>renting the space</b> through the Capital Fringe Festival. The festival charges $585 for use of space, but also provides the lighting and sound equipment we require. Another $500 will be used for <b>administrative needs</b> such as royalties, photography, advertising, and printing. The final $250 goes towards <b>technical and design needs</b> including set, props, and costumes. These last two categories are where the little things add up. $5 buys us a box of screws. $15 buys a roll of Gaff tape. $20 buys a can of paint. $50 pays for postcards and fliers. $60 pays for online advertising. All of these small things build the foundation for a successful show and an informed audience to support it.</p><p></p><ul><li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">In Summary:</span></li></ul><ul>

What now?
One of the tricky things about the Fringe festival is that you are subject to any number of variables, from the space they put you in to the times your curtain goes up. 
We had an unexpected twist when Fringe gave us a wonderful space at Gallaudet University. We are so excited to have use of their captioning system and the opportunity to be accessible to the deaf community. Did you know that DC has the largest deaf community in the nation? 


With this boon, however, comes new challenges. When Doorway Arts does something, we do it right. We want to be able to offer an ASL interpreter at multiple performances. This is an unexpected cost but we believe that it is worth every penny. 
Any amount donated will go towards a new goal of providing an ASL interpreter for Out of Sync. If we go above and beyond that goal or do not quite reach it,  the proceeds will go towards paying a much deserved bonus to our artists. 
We are so grateful to everyone who has donated, shared, and liked. Each and every one of you is responsible for our success. 
Please continue to spread the word, we still have lots of neat perks and amazing set sculptures available and we aren't done yet!


Who Are We?I’m Mary Cat Gill,  the associate artistic director of Doorway Arts Theatre Company as well as a local artist with many other  hats. I started this campaign to fund the production of an incredible new play, Out of Sync, as part of the 2015 Capital Fringe Festival. Our goal is to motivate a larger conversation about mental illness and encourage our audience to reconsider the secret lives of the people around them.What We Need & What You GetBy donating to this project, you will be aiding in the creation of a beautiful and relevant piece of art with a crucial message, supporting the mission of Doorway Arts to engage with local artists, including up-and-coming playwright Katie Woods and furthering the conversation about mental illness.In order to mount this production, we will need your support. The financial costs of renting the theater space, mounting staging, and paying for the production of the play are large to a company of our size, but even one dollar adds up when many have pulled together.  Your donation will bring this play to reality.Why this play?Last summer I had been tackling some of the questions around society and mental illness. Why do we embrace it as a media sensation, share in the tragedy of celebrity suicide or violent incident, then sweep it under rug when the mourning period had passed? Why do we keep skirting an issue that affects not just celebrities, but 1 in 5 Americans? It was around this time that I discovered Katie Woods’ play, Out of Sync, and was offered the challenge of a script that tackles the issues of depression and anxiety in a new way. A way that highlights the quiet struggles of one average person and how they create a ripple effect that shapes us all.What is it about?Out of Sync follows Nathan and Petra, a young couple just beginning their relationship. But when the memories of his ex-girlfriend Amy start to bleed into the present, Nathan struggles to move forward. Amy’s crippling depression – and the devastation it eventually caused in their relationship – begins to splinter the fragile new bonds forming between Nathan and Petra. This beautiful new work explores the fragile intersection between love and mental illness through text and movement. Where does the money go?Even small donations go a long way. Here’s how we break down the budget. Our largest and most important expense is paying our staff. This show requires 3 actors, a dance choreographer, two designers, and a stage manager on top of the director and producer. To be able to pay everyone, that totals out to $900. Our second largest expense is renting the space through the Capital Fringe Festival. The festival charges $585 for use of space, but also provides the lighting and sound equipment we require. Another $500 will be used for administrative needs such as royalties, photography, advertising, and printing. The final $250 goes towards technical and design needs including set, props, and costumes. These last two categories are where the little things add up. $5 buys us a box of screws. $15 buys a roll of Gaff tape. $20 buys a can of paint. $50 pays for postcards and fliers. $60 pays for online advertising. All of these small things build the foundation for a successful show and an informed audience to support it.In Summary:
Space = $585
Staff pay = $900
Administrative needs = $500
Technical needs = $250
Total = 2,235
Why does it matter?Theater has the particular ability to invite the audience to partake in and continue a dialogue long after the curtain has gone down.  By supporting the theater, you are supporting the conversation. By donating to this show, you are supporting a conversation about depression and anxiety in everyday life.Where and when?Eastman Studio Theatre at Gallaudet University800 Florida Avenue, NE Washington, DC 20002Saturday July 11th - 9:15 pmSunday July 12th - 4:15 pmFriday July 17th - 9:45 pmSaturday July 18th - 4:00 pmThursday July 23rd - 7:30 pmSaturday July 25th - 4:00pmAll performances will be captioned and/or have an ASL interpreter, Other Ways You Can HelpThere are many ways to contribute other than a financial donation.Follow our work on the Doorway Arts website: www.doorwayarts.orgVisit us on facebook at: https://www.facebook.com/doorwayartsTweet us @doorwayarts #outofsyncDCNo amount of money can pay for the success of good buzz.Please spread the word and share the links!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>THE PROJECT</h3>
<p>All Thomas wants is to be like his cousin David. As these boys begin to grow into men, it becomes clear that there may be more to self-acceptance than fitting in. Presented by <strong>Snapper Theatre</strong>, <i>Thomas</i> by Robbie Curran explores the experiences of living with Asperger’s syndrome, and the challenges it poses both in life’s milestones and in the everyday.</p>
<p><i>Thomas</i> will premiere at <strong>VAULT Festival 2019</strong>, which will give us an opportunity to showcase this production to future collaborators for a regional tour in late 2019/20. We strive for <i>Thomas</i> to be accessible to a wide range of audiences to ensure the broadest possible reach for the conversation about neurodiversity and representation.</p>
<h3>
<br/>AIMS</h3>
<ul>
<li>To respectfully challenge people’s expectations of the capabilities of those with autism.</li>
<li>To raise awareness on what being on the spectrum can feel like.</li>
<li>To tell a story that is hopefully equally funny and moving, to help anyone watching who is diagnosed feel less alone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our goal is to present <i>Thomas</i>, both to audiences without first-hand experience of autism, in order to dispel stereotypes, as well as to people who either have Asperger’s or loved ones who do, to help them see themselves on stage. This is paramount to helping us achieve our three core aims.</p>
<p>Your support will enable us to develop <i>Thomas</i> into a full-scale production. We will achieve this through collaboration with a creative team, and local and national charities which support those with autism. With your support, we will be able to bring <i>Thomas</i> to life and raise awareness of what growing up with autism is like. Please donate to help us hit the target and make all of this possible.<br/> </p>
<h3>SNAPPER THEATRE</h3>
<p><strong>Snapper Theatre</strong> formed in 2017. Our mission is to tell stories that are underrepresented or misrepresented in theatre. We aim to amplify unheard stories, finding the ordinary in the extraordinary, and the extraordinary in the ordinary. Snapper Theatre’s debut production was <i>Lobster</i>, which was presented as ‘work in progress’ as part of Mountview’s Catalyst Festival and premiered at Theatre503 in January 2018.</p>
<p>When Robbie brought <i>Thomas</i> to us, we recognised that this play fell into both categories. It's rare to find a play that presents growing up on the autistic spectrum, and when you do, it often follows into more commonly perceived stereotypes. In a theatre industry that is seeking greater representation across the board, we often find that neurodiversity does not get the same attention as other inclusive groups, and we want to be able to support these voices. Robbie brought us a story that is honest and hilarious, and above all meaningful.</p>
<p>We're so excited to bring <i>Thomas</i> to <strong>VAULT Festival</strong>, and we need your support to make it happen.</p>
<h3>
<br/>HOW ELSE YOU CAN HELP</h3>
<p>We know that not everyone can contribute financially, but there are other ways in which you can support <i>Thomas</i>. Anything you can do to help promote the production would mean the world to us. If you know anyone who would be interested in the production, please email us on: snappertheatre@gmail.com</p>

Elysium Conservatory Theatre inaugurates our new company and home with a wondrous and fantastical reawakening of the greatest love story ever told, William Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet. Artistic Director Aaron Ganz has chosen to dive fearlessly into the very essence of love - weaving stunning choreography, poetry, and music into a theatrical adventure that pushes the very Boundaries of Possible. ECT's Romeo & Juliet presents audiences with an opportunity to feel one of Shakespeare's finest works as it was intended; raw, human and capable of revealing the very harmony of love.   
 
Other Ways You Can Help
The success of this project lies in the sense of community it inspires. We believe in the power of community. It is an ever increasing force, a will that can do things that no single person - no matter their talents - can achieve on their own. Put simply, we are Believers. Optimists. Enthusiasts. We invite you to share in our dream - that together we can build an artistic paradise of devoted, passionate, and FEARLESS artists, boldly pushing the boundaries of performance throughout the world!",0.0,0,"24 Campaigns

<h3><strong>You've heard of New Yiddish Rep . . .</strong></h3>
<p><strong>We're the non-profit theater company that since 2007 has staged contemporary treatments of Yiddish classics, and Yiddish interpretations of modern/post-modern stage masterworks like ""Waiting for Godot"".</strong> This year, we were nominated for a 2016 Drama Desk award for our Yiddish-language production of Arthur Miller's classic tragedy, ""Death of a Salesman"".  NYR's Off-Broadway productions feature a new generation of Yiddish actors revitalizing cutting-edge dramas in <i>mame-loshn </i>with easily-understood English supertitles.</p>
<h3>But have you heard about our Yiddish ""God of Vengeance""?</h3>
<p>More than one hundred years after it rocked Second Avenue and Broadway with its whores, pimps, and first onstage lesbian kiss, <strong>Sholem Asch’s indecent play, “God of Vengeance”, is returning to the New York stage in its original Yiddish in New Yiddish Repertory Theater's Off-Broadway production (Dec. 22nd, 2016 to Jan. 22nd, 2017) at La MaMa (74A East 4th Street, NYC).</strong> </p>
<p>Directed by legendary actress/director Eleanor Reissa, the production will feature performances by Reissa and New Yiddish Rep members Shane Baker, David Mandelbaum, Caraid O'Brien, Shayna Schmidt, and Melissa Weisz, with new young Yiddish actors filling out the 11-member cast.</p>
<p><strong>After two SRO readings in June 2016 at NYC’s OPEN: Festival of New Jewish Theatre, New Yiddish Rep is reviving <i>""Got Fun Nekome""</i> as Asch wrote it in 1906 and as it was performed in Second Avenue's Yiddish theater.</strong>  Set in a Warsaw bordello, the play's struggle between godliness and worldliness, and the tenderness of the lesbian scenes, seem even more fresh and relevant today.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">But as Paula Vogel’s recent play “Indecent” at the Vineyard Theatre strikingly depicted, when </span><i style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">“Got Fun Nekome“</i><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> moved uptown to Broadway in 1923 as the English-language“God of Vengeance”, the scandalous play was closed by police, and its entire cast and producer arrested and convicted on charges of giving ""an obscene, indecent, immoral, and impure theatrical performance.""   </span></p>
<p><strong>Since its tumultuous American debut, ""God of Vengeance"" has been performed continually over the past century throughout Europe and the US in a variety of languages - but never again in Yiddish.  </strong>Asch’s earthy language in <i>“Got Fun Nekome”</i> – a people’s Yiddish born in the streets and slums – is at the same time filled with poetry and symbolism.  The play’s <i>mame-loshn</i> is rich, raw, and modern, despite being more than one hundred years old.</p>
<p><strong>Asch's ""God of Vengeance"" also ranks in world theater on a par with classics like Strindberg's ""Ghosts"" and Ibsen's ""A Doll's House"".</strong>  Its open depiction of lesbian love, condemnation of religious hypocrisy, and feeling portrayals of deeply flawed humanity place <i>""Got Fun Nekome""</i> in the pantheon of important LGBTQ theater as well as modern social drama.</p>
<h3>But we need your help to bring back <i>""Got Fun Nekome""</i><i>!</i>
</h3>
<p><strong>New Yiddish Rep's one-month run of <i>""Got Fun Nekome""</i> at LaMama will cost us an estimated $135,000</strong> - for our actors, director, designers, crew, sets, costumes, lighting, sound, space rental, ticket service, marketing, printing, and insurance.  </p>
<p><strong>You know that no theater company can cover its production costs by ticket sales alone.</strong>  At $36 a ticket for a 100-seat Off-Broadway theater, we'll realistically bring in only about $60,000 from those 32 performances.  That would leave us $75,000 in the red, and limit New Yiddish Rep's future opportunities to present even more vital Yiddish theater.</p>
<p><strong>That's why we need your help to successfully bring <i>""Got Fun Nekome""</i> to Off-Broadway in December!</strong>  With your gift - from $36 to $5,000 - New Yiddish Rep can present this ground-breaking play in its original Yiddish as it should be seen and heard - vital, challenging, and deeply moving.  </p>
<p><strong>We've received some grants and are talking to other ""angels"" who can help make up the difference.  But your gift is crucial.  </strong>And rest assured - whatever donation you can make will go directly to pay for New Yiddish Rep's production costs.</p>
<h3>So please donate today!  </h3>
<p><strong>If you're one of the 110 wonderful people who helped us successfully raise more than $10,000 through IndieGoGo in March 2016</strong> to send our ""Waiting For Godot"" <i>(""Vartn af Godot"") </i>to Paris<i>, </i>we hope you'll step up again and make whatever donation you can for <i>""Got Fun Nekome""</i>.</p>

<h3>Brelby's Story</h3>
<p>The Brelby Theatre Company is still a relatively young group on the Arizona theatre scene. Now in their third year of producing, the group was founded by fellow NAU alumni Brian Maticic and his now wife, Shelby Maticic. They united under a common vision, along with many other creative minds, to create an organization that allowed for more than just the production of great theatre, but as a resource for artists (both experienced and novice) to shape their abilities and fine tune their skills while pursuing various projects that not only challenge but also entertain. 
</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Ultimate Goal</h3>
<p>Brelby's dream is to bring their skills to the communities that helped shape them as artists. Headed by a young, but determined duo, this production will take place no matter what kind of funds we raise. Our last season was entirely funded out of our own pockets, so if we have to eat ramen noodles for a month...this production will take place. However, we are working towards the ultimate goal of obtaining our own producing space. We want a steady location, where we can create entertaining shows, as well as provide enriching classes and workshops to our surrounding Phoenix community. 
</p>
<h3>""God's Favorite""</h3>
<p>By Neil Simon</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This entertaining piece, loosely based on the biblical story of Job, is a perfect fit for the skills of our agile and energetic group. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Successful Long Island businessman Joe Benjamin is a modern-day 'Job' with a high-maintenance wife, ungrateful children and wise-cracking household help. Just when it seems things couldn't get any worse, he is visited by Sidney Lipton aka A Messenger from God (and compulsive film buff) with a mission: test Joe's faith and report back to ""the Boss"". The jokes and Tests of Faith fly fast and furious as Neil Simon spins a contemporary morality tale like no other in this hilarious comedy. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Breaking It Down</h3>
<p>Our rental fees for this production will range anywhere between $2000 and $2400, depending on ticket sales. </p>
<p>We would like to raise enough to cover the facilities fees, production costs, as well as some funding to use towards advertising costs. In the miraculous instance that we raise more than our goal, the money will go directly towards funding our own location.</p>

<h3>What We're Up To</h3>
<p> We aim to run the<a href=""http://www.primestocktheatre.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Prime Stock Theatre Co""> Bard On Bower</a>- a three week Shakespeare in the Park festival on the outdoor stage in Red Deer's lovely Bower Ponds. We aim to produce a contemporary themed version of Taming of the Shrew and Macbeth- set in Northern Ireland in the 1970s during 'the troubles'.  </p>

<h3>Why We're Doing it</h3>
<p>Because everyone needs more culture. We are trying to show that Red Deer has both the means and the interest to become a real center for artistic happenings. We hope to be at the center of this, developing this festival year by year into a major city event- something that everyone in Central Alberta can look forward to.

 We aim to run the Bard On Bower- a three week Shakespeare in the Park festival on the outdoor stage in Red Deer's lovely Bower Ponds. We aim to produce a contemporary themed version of Taming of the Shrew and Macbeth- set in Northern Ireland in the 1970s during 'the troubles'.

Finding success sharing other people's embarrassing, hilarious or harrowing private thoughts, Davy uncovers the secret we've all forgotten: the things we hide are often the very things we have in common. <br/></p>
<p><i>FOUND</i> weaves together Davy's story with those of countless other real people, through the notes they've lost that others have found. <i>FOUND THE MUSICAL</i> isn't just based on a true story, it's based on hundreds of them.</p>

Music and Original Lyrics by Eli Bolin

An original new musical, and you can help take it to the next level! Get an exclusive insider's experience bringing a new work to the NYC stage!

ANNOUNCEMENT:We are thrilled to announce that FOUND THE MUSICAL will have its NYC debut at the Atlantic Theater Company in the fall! The Atlantic has been a huge supporter of the show, and we're honored to be opening their 2014-15 season.There's still time to join us on this exciting journey. Our Indiegogo campaign is ending at midnight tonight — don't miss the chance to be a part of this show!What is FOUND THE MUSICAL?

FOUND THE MUSICAL is based on scores of outrageous and eccentric discarded notes and letters that have been ""found"" in the real world by every-day people. Inspired by actual events, the show follows FOUND MAGAZINE creator Davy Rothbart from his discovery of a shocking note mistakenly left on his car, through his unlikely adventure creating a cult favorite indie magazine with his friends. Finding success sharing other people's embarrassing, hilarious or harrowing private thoughts, Davy uncovers the secret we've all forgotten: the things we hide are often the very things we have in common. 
FOUND weaves together Davy's story with those of countless other real people, through the notes they've lost that others have found. FOUND THE MUSICAL isn't just based on a true story, it's based on hundreds of them.
Every dollar we raise with this campaign will go towards further developing the show and getting it in front of an audience in New York City!

<h3>Hello. We are VECTOR. Nice to meet you. <br/>
</h3>
<p>VECTOR is a Durham-based multi-media dance company creating work that questions the rules and societal norms that shape our daily lives.  Directed by visual artist Jon Haas and choreographer Leah Wilks, the company uses highly physical, detail-oriented movement in combination with video, audio documentary, motion-tracking, and projections to create participatory installations, evening-length performances and dance films.  Their recent projects include <i>Secrets I Never Told My Mother</i> (2012), <i>Stitch</i> (2013), <i>Still Point</i> (2013), <i>Mess</i> (2014) and the upcoming <i>Habitus</i> (2015). <br/></p>
<p>Jon and Leah met in 2011 working on the production <i>Mau A Malawi: Stories of AIDS Through Music</i> at Memorial Hall in Chapel Hill. Through the craziness of mounting a cross-disciplinary show in a very short period of time they decided they liked working together. From 2011-2013 they collaborated on projects as their own separate companies LeahWilksDance and HaaStudios, and then finally decided to join forces under the moniker VECTOR in 2014.</p>

<p>Habitus is a multi-media dance project exploring the intersections of anger, education, and identity. <br/></p>
<p>What is the role of aggression and violence in our lives and how does that influence the world around us? What is it that we consider to be “normal”? How far must we be pushed before we begin to question what we have always taken for granted?<br/></p>
<p>Using highly physical, detail-oriented movement in combination with cutting-edge motion-tracking technology, and audio-documentary, the full evening-length version of Habitus will premiere in Durham, NC in March 2015.  An interactive installation version of the piece will premiere as a part of the “Other Voices” series at Manbites Dog Theater in Durham, NC in January 2015.</p>

</div></div>","Welcome to Greece... Lascivious Something takes you on a journey to a secluded Greek Island in November 1980 on the evening of Reagan's inauguration.  Here you will meet August, whose passions are winemaking, and his luscious young wife, Daphne.  With the celebratory tasting of August's first 'rare varietal' wine upon them, the festivities are interrupted by the unexpected arrival of August's former lover, Liza.   Who we are... In September of 2012, Sarah Rose and Lori Watt had the great honour of meeting and working on the award nominated Fringe Onsite Show Lost in Twine:  the Untold Stories of the Netloft by Kelsey Blair. They partnered up again for the UBC Production of The Vagina Monologues at the Frederich Wood Theatre in February of 2013.  Now TBA Theatre Company (founded by Sarah Rose) and the Frolicking Divas (founded by Lisa Beth Dery & Lori Watt) have joined forces to bring you Sheila Callaghan's Lascivious Something, coming to the Vancouver International Fringe Festival's inaugural Dramatic Work Series at the Cultch Lab.  We are thrilled to participate in this new category of the Festival along with the other 5 companies  which provides mentorship from Director Scott Bellis (founding member and Artistic Associate at Bard on the Beach).

<div>
<i>We Carry the Ocean Inside Us</i> is an evening length dance concert that will bring the ocean to the Missoula Valley.  It explores how the ocean can serve as a source of comfort and a metaphor for fear amid the tranquility and turbulence of life.  <i>We Carry the Ocean Inside Us</i> will be presented at the Downtown Dance Collective in Missoula, MT on May 15.  This concert delves into the deep emotions of loneliness, frustration, and fear.  The vastness and mystery of the ocean is mesmerizing, comforting, and terrifying.  The work uses human interaction, representation of natural elements, and personal connection to explore the depths of circulating emotion.  With a crashing force, eight dancers personify inherent human struggle and find support in the rippling of the waves.  Choreographer, Emily Jay Vascimini, is intrigued by the strong presence of the ocean and how it can relate to the human experience.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The concert presents the ocean through an inspired and novel lens that will tug on your heart strings and make you want to dip your toes in the waves.  It portrays a journey of loneliness, fight for control, frustration, anger, support, and solace.  <i>We Carry the Ocean Inside Us</i> is enlivening, personal, dynamic, textured, poignant, and heartwarming.  </div>

<h3>Who we are:</h3>
<div>Emily Jay Vascimini is a senior at the University of Montana working toward her BFA in Dance, choreography and performance.  This project is both the culmination of her college career and the beginning of her professional career as a dancer.  She is interested in the relationship and connection between the ocean and human emotion.  Vascimini grew up on the New Jersey shore and with the ocean running through her veins, she dives into an exploration of struggle, frustration, and growth through the ocean and its elements, such as sand, wind, currents, and storms.  Her choreographic works delve into honesty, vulnerability, emotion, and experience.  She is working with lighting designers, costume designers, and technical crew, as well as 8 dancers from the University of Montana to create this concert.</div>

By producing student-written theatre, Vertigo hopes to be a creative and dynamic presence on campus, encouraging students to take artistic risk. Vertigo is the only student theatre organization on campus that produces entirely student-written work.ABOUT THE PLAY: Written by senior theatre student Sam Mueller, Moon & Back is an original play set to go up at Northwestern University on April 23rd through 25th. Moon & Back is the story of the Rose family, starting from the moment their patriarch, Gregory, writes home to say he is taking another tour overseas, rocking the foundation of the family. The play tracks the unraveling of each family member as they begin having visions of Gregory - the ghost of a man who is still alive but very much so out of reach - as his absence in their family is felt. Based on a true story, Moon & Back is the dissection of a family hitting rock bottom and being forced to keep going.We cannot reach this goal without your help. The production is entirely student produced and funded, independent of the University, so only with your financial support can we get this play successfully across the finish line. All donations, no matter how small, are greatly appreciated and are tax deductible! With your help, the possibilities for this show are endless.THE MOON & BACK TEAM:Cast:

</p><p><span>Counterpoint Players develop,
produce, and <b>play with theatre

about creating a theatrical space that brings people together to engage
directly in theatre that challenges artists and audiences to examine their own
connection to humanity.</span><i><span><br/></span></i></p><p><i><span>Corpus</span></i><span> presents
a fresh approach to the dark and all-too-familiar subject matter of Holocaust
literature. The script
bravely explores the dangerous territory of fictionalizing – and
sensationalizing – dark chapters in history. Despite the fact that our own life
experiences have been so safely removed from the horrors of the Holocaust, we have been haunted by a third generation version of survivor’s guilt that compels us to want to
tell this story. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>In
conjunction with the production, we will offer a special preview performance in honour of Holocaust
Remembrance Week on April 30th. We are excited to connect with our
audiences and discuss the ideas, themes, and
questions presented in the play through talkbacks
after the performance. <br/></span></p><p><span>
</span></p><p><i></i>In the works for a decade before this world premiere, <em>Corpus</em> has developed with workshops and readings at the National Theatre School, by the Banff Playwrights and a staged reading by The Travelling Jewish Theatre Company in San Francisco. In 2007, <em>Corpus </em>won the Calgary Peace Play Prize and was further developed with a workshop and staged reading at the University of Calgary. In 2010 it won the In The Beginning Jewish Playwrights Contest, the same year Darrah won the Canadian Jewish Playwrighting Award for <em>Corpus</em>. The play was published in the winter 2012 edition of The Canadian Theatre Review, which is where Bronwyn discovered the script last year.<br/></p>

About Corpus:
A young and ambitious genocide scholar
stumbles across the mysterious relationship between the wife of a Nazi officer
and a Polish Jewish prisoner in Auschwitz. As she investigates a dark history,
Megan is torn between her quest for academic fame and the unexpected charms of
her online lover, the seductive Heinrich. A tale about history and memory told
with humour and compassion.Corpus has received several workshops, table-readings and awards, and was
published in Canadian Theatre Review. And now, Counterpoint Players is proud to bring you its
WORLD PREMIERE.Counterpoint Players productions are 
exciting, provocative,
independent theatre that make you laugh, think and feel something. Support
brave independent artists in the telling of a story that needs to be heard -- and join us in making it happen! Corpus is a big show for an independent theatre company. It has a large cast and requires some sophisticated technology as part of the story. We have already received some support from the Canada Council for the Arts and the Jewish Federation of Ottawa, but those grants add up to only about a quarter of our budget!What We Need & What You GetSo what do we still need? We need you to help us build the world of Corpus.  When you come to see the show you'll be sitting in a space that you transformed into the world of the play, by helping us with:
The 2-week rental of Arts Court Theatre ($2,000)
Set materials including paint, projection screens, furniture, and computers ($800)
Rental and/or purchase of video equipment, including 2 live-streaming cameras, a video switcher, and software to run it all ($600)
Paying our technician for 80 hours of work that will make it all happen ($1,600)
With $5000 we can build a whole world!And if we exceed our fundraising goal, then your contributions will go toward our other expenses, which include:
Rehearsal venue rental
Print and social media advertising 
Printing posters, postcards and programs
And most importantly: paying our amazing team of professional artists fairly for their talent and their work!
By contributing to our campaign and helping us bring this project to life, there are a variety of PERKS you could receive, including tickets to the show,  Counterpoint Players t-shirts, signed show posters, or a limited edition signed photography print from photographer and Corpus designer Wes Kline. (Take a look at his work here: www.weskline.com)And of course with every contribution you will receive our sincerest ever-loving thanks!The Impact
Counterpoint Players develop,
produce, and play with theatre
that provides a counterpoint. We are passionate
about creating a theatrical space that brings people together to engage
directly in theatre that challenges artists and audiences to examine their own
connection to humanity.Corpus presents
a fresh approach to the dark and all-too-familiar subject matter of Holocaust
literature. The script
bravely explores the dangerous territory of fictionalizing – and
sensationalizing – dark chapters in history. Despite the fact that our own life
experiences have been so safely removed from the horrors of the Holocaust, we have been haunted by a third generation version of survivor’s guilt that compels us to want to
tell this story. 

In
conjunction with the production, we will offer a special preview performance in honour of Holocaust
Remembrance Week on April 30th. We are excited to connect with our
audiences and discuss the ideas, themes, and
questions presented in the play through talkbacks
after the performance. 
In the works for a decade before this world premiere, Corpus has developed with workshops and readings at the National Theatre School, by the Banff Playwrights and a staged reading by The Travelling Jewish Theatre Company in San Francisco. In 2007, Corpus won the Calgary Peace Play Prize and was further developed with a workshop and staged reading at the University of Calgary. In 2010 it won the In The Beginning Jewish Playwrights Contest, the same year Darrah won the Canadian Jewish Playwrighting Award for Corpus. The play was published in the winter 2012 edition of The Canadian Theatre Review, which is where Bronwyn discovered the script last year.


Founded by Bronwyn in 2009, Counterpoint
Players has created five original productions and collaborated on two co-productions. Sarah
Ruhl's In the Next
Room (or the vibrator play) at the Gladstone (May 2013), a co-production with Same Day Theatre and Plosive Productions, was
recently nominated for 5 Prix Rideau Awards, including Outstanding Direction
(Bronwyn Steinberg) and Outstanding Production. Projects under Bronwyn's
leadership created work for more than 20 Ottawa-based theatre professionals in
2013 alone, as well as many others over the past 5 years. She was also recently recognized for her contribution to Ottawa's arts scene by being named as a finalist for the RBC Emerging Artist Award in Ottawa.

<h3>Parramatta Riverside Theatres, Sydney, 25th-27th October, 2012.</h3>

<p><strong>Who?</strong></p>
<p>Dean Walsh has been involved in dance for the past 21 years as choreographer, dancer / performer, educator, workshop facilitator and is a current Australia Council Dance Fellow (2011-2012).</p>
<p>Throughout his career he has wrestled scocial themes that have resonated with the real life situations he inhabits or has stemmed from. Through choreographic treatments, he has crafted performances that inspire, provoke, entertain, challenge, partake in community outreach, attracting a very diverse audience range.</p>
<p>Dancers / collaborators, Kathryn Puie and Natalie Ayton are both exceptionally instinctive and skilled dancers with a wealth of performance experience.</p>
<h3>
<strong>A </strong><strong>n</strong><strong>ew beginning: multiple transformations:</strong>
</h3>
<p><strong><strong>Why? </strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>Words from Dean...<br/></strong></strong></p>
<p>PRIME: ORDERLY is two things...</p>
<p>Firstly, it's the name of an upcoming dance work (the subject of this campaign), which will distil specific elements of my two-year Fellowship research into marine sub-scapes and human-animal movement studies.</p>
<p>Secondly, it's the name I've given my developing choreographic system comprising multifarious modes, embodiments (physical language) that is referenced when composing works, used as an education tool and to bring diverse physical disciplines and research together.</p>
<p>The eclectic choreographic disciplines of my twenty-year performance making are the foundation of this system. The next task was to infuse this with insights from my marine studies and through much practical experimentation - solo and with others - in venues across Sydney, notably, Macquarie University and Performance Space.</p>
<p>In 2005, after years working abroad, I returned to Sydney keen to shift my conceptual focus from only refelecting themes such as: domestic violence, homophobia, social-familial identity and the more 'monstrous' masculinities - things I'd encountered myself from a young age. Those works were physically based, often with a good serving of text, raw ironic humour and a lot of truth-telling. Stemming from a childhood rife with much male volatilty (including underworld figures), finding dance was pure chance and life-changing. I decided it was time for another major change...</p>
<p>In 2008 I finally commenced scuba diving (it had been an interest for many years as had marine environments). This immersive enviro-physical experience immediately secured my interest to find ways to bring the natural realm into my dance practice – both choreographically and conceptually.</p>
<p>I also saw it as a way to bring two inexplicably captivating physical practices (dance and diving) together to inspire creative, personal and artform transformations. To do it properly I needed an extended time-frame to descend deep into my inquiries, hence the Australia Council Fellowship.</p>
<p><strong>Prime: Orderly, as a movement system,</strong> is helping me organise my eclectic and idiosyncratic dance embodiments, of the past two decades - influenced by many past and present practitioners / pioneers - into a language-defining template now inspired by new environmental territoires larger than my own.</p>
<p><strong>Point of research:</strong> I've been interested to see if there might be ways to choreographically 'score' elemental functions of the myriad eco-systems, habitats and marine species physiology found in that vast space around us. Not outer space but inner space - the ocean, our genetic and ancestral home. I didn't want to do it solely through theoretical study - hence the scuba start up. I'm using this template of modes and codes as point of clarity to further inspire theoretical and practical exchange between artists, divers and other marine experts.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME: ORDERLY</strong>,<strong> the performance event is broken up into two sections.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 1:</strong> is called <em>AnEnemy -</em> our perceptions of predator. What constitutes a predator...what do we see? Is it their appearance, behaviour or both? What are the primordial markers of our fear? Who or what is a predator? Is it through action or inaction that we ourselves predate?</p>
<p><strong>Section 2:</strong> is called <em>Under Pressure</em> and takes an hour scuba dive timeline as structural, choreographic inspiration to make a thirty-minute trio that also reflects on other aspects of marine concern and physiological suspension.</p>
<p>'Wild' dancing will occur and stories will be told...</p>
<h2><strong>Your contribution:</strong></h2>
<p>We seek your financial assistance (large or small) to help present PRIME: ORDERLY in its best possible realisation. FORM Dance Projects and Riverside have invested significantly in the production. This is a great opportunity to get the work presented without jumping on the government grant funding cycle for presentation. Your contribution will help make a work that can attract potential partners, to support our future choreographic research throughout 2013 and 2014. We need another $4,000 to do this properly.<br/><br/> Campaign contributions for the production will also go towards production manager / rigger Simon for helping to make the technical aspects run smoothly and let Dean 'off the hook'!  A fee for our excellent video mixer and documentor Martin Fox for his artistry and work load.</p></div>","Introductory note:

<h3>About Trio:</h3>
<p>TrioDance Collective was founded in New York City in 2010 by Barbie Diewald and Emily Jeffries, and has since produced five seasons of new work!  One main tenet of our mission as a company is to foster individual development within the structure of a fiercely supportive group, and we are so proud of the artists who have grown alongside us over the course of the last two years.  </p>
<p>TrioDance Collective is currently built on the work of:</p>
<p>Two choreographers: Barbie Diewald and Emily Jeffries</p>
<p>and eleven wonderfully intelligent and articulate dancers: Sarah Moore, Cara McGaughey, Allison Beler, Carly Fox-Horton, Sachiko Takimura, Britney Falcon, Susan Philipp, Alyssa Forte, Emily Craver, Colleen Hoelscher, Carmella Ollero.</p>
<p>We all strive to create richly creative, non-competitive, humble processes within which to work.  </p>
<p>Trio's newest repertory works <em>Rooms</em> and <em>Here</em> will premiere at the venerable 92nd Street Y Harkness Dance Center's Buttenwieser Hall on May 25th and May 26th, 2012, and we are getting very excited!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why we need your help now:</h3>
<p>Though our Spring performance is only a couple of weeks away, and the entire proccess is nearing completion, producing one's own work in New York is a mammoth task, and one that is very costly. Through fundraising events, ticket sales from our Spring series ""Green Line,"" and fees from our Spring workshop series, we were able to raise a significant amount of funds to Produce our own work in New York, but we still need your help.  </p>
<p>We need to raise thousands of dollars each season to cover costs associated with bringing these works from studio to stage.  This covers: rehearsal space, performers' salaries and collaborator's expenses, video documentation, costuming, marketing materials, and programs.</p>
<p>We are looking to you, people who are interested in our artists, our efforts, and the dance community that we care for so deeply, to collectively contribute $3,000.  Please become a part of TrioDance Collective's work.  We cannot wait to share it with you.  </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>America has some of the most diverse geography, each state is like a cultural and geographic world of it's own. As an artist I want to experience and traslate each location on my journey into movement as an interaction with my surroundings. Dance films allow site specific work like this to be composed in a way that an audience can view from thousnads of miles away. </p>
<p>This will be a unique project that will create a true collection of the american experience through dance and imagery. As an artist I am always striving for new ways to create work that reflects the world around me in the most honest way possible. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>FUNDA means “to teach and to learn” in the African languages of Zulu and KiSwahili. The founding RIBS members, including Rochel Coleman, Ramona Bass Kolobe, Len Cabral, Abigail Jefferson, Melodie Thompson Thomas and Raffini, decided we wanted to create a statewide storytelling event that would celebrate and showcase the beautiful diversity of the African oral art and tradition by bringing a wide range of Black storytellers to Rhode Island. We chose the week around the Martin Luther King Holiday, intentionally, to help highlight the story, and to lead our community to Black History Month in February.</p>
<p>Our first year, in 1999, we had 8 tellers in 4 schools and three public performances over 3 days. Last year we had 10 tellers in 41 school performances and public performances across the state, reaching over 6000 people! We now present public performances from Westerly, to Woonsocket, Providence to Newport, and school and community shows all across the region. This year’s festival will take place from January 19-27, 2013.</p>
<p>In the words of one of our 2012 attendees:</p>
<p><em>First, the Saturday line up at Funda was exceptional...the kids who went to the Woonsocket performance started saying Z-Ca-Mo instead of thank you...now the entire class uses that term, I was wondering if you knew the words for you're welcome? We used the Story Corp idea and had parents record a memory from their childhood. We play it throughout the day and at rest...their expressions are priceless when they hear their parent's voice, very heartwarming. Their stories are from the heart. So thanks for keeping the stories alive and sharing your creativity...</em></p>

<p>My name is Sara Head, and I am a senior in the Residential College at the University of Michigan. In my final semester, I have the delight and the honor of directing a production of David Adjmi's brilliant play <i>Marie Antoinette</i> with the RC Players, a completely student-run organization on campus. I feel very fortunate to have found a piece of theatre that satisfies the wildest extents of my imagination. <i>Marie Antoinette</i> is dramatic, funny, and superbly bizarre. It is a director's dream, as is the incredible cast and crew of people I have working alongside me. </p>
<p>The script has allowed me dream big in a million different ways, and I would love to be able to craft an experience for the audience that surpasses the typical boundaries of our venue and budget. Our beloved Marie never stood for anything less than over-the-top, and I hope to capture that spirit in my production. With some financial support, I will be able to achieve costumes, sets, and effects worthy of the Butterfly Queen.</p>
<p>In order to help fund our production, we are looking to raise $500. This will make a huge dent in covering the costs of hand-made costumes and wigs for the entire cast, an immersive and dream-like set, and promotional materials to spread the word. Every little bit counts in making this play a truly special piece of theatre. Even the smallest contributions can have a huge impact in what we are able to achieve!</p>
<p> I think that this piece has the power to have a profound impact on the communities both on campus and in the world at large. Above all else, we will seek to entertain. <i>Marie Antoinette</i> is a production that is quirky, fun, and visually rich. It will provide an enchanting respite from the state of the world outside of the theatre. I think this is a key aspect of art’s larger purpose—it enriches the lives of those who witness it. However, I think that there are critical opportunities in the script to send a larger message to the audience, and perhaps offer insight into relevant current affairs. It is my hope that the production will inspire both its participants and its audience to exit the theater changed from the way they came in, moved to go out into the world and make a difference. Seeing what has come before in such a descriptive, accessible way can offer a world of clarity to where to begin working in the present.</p>
<p>This production will be only the most recent in a long line of RCP productions that have provided an outlet to students for expressing their creativity making change in the world. I could not ask for a more supportive and encouraging organization to back my project, and I wholeheartedly believe that this project will turn into something that will continue to nourish and grow a student group that has been making theatre on campus for over forty years.</p>
<p>If you cannot make a financial contribution to <i>Marie Antoinette</i>, we would love your support in other forms, whether that be sharing this page with your friends and family or coming out to the Keene Theater on March 17th or 18th to join us for our performances!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>In May 2012, a young group of international actors was put together by an Italian girl willing to create something good and cultural in the city of Berlin. After a few months the group doubled its size and the faith and enthusiasm for the project grew and grew.<br/>We are now 2 organizers and 8 actors. A great group!</p>
<p>The project is called Theater am Tisch, an entirely new way of consuming theatre– at the table. We tear down the famous fourth wall and actors are no longer separated by the stage, but rather come to your table and perform right there over a dinner or an aperitif- just for you! Sometimes theatre is an elite and exclusive world which a lot of people cannot enjoy: Theater am Tisch is open to all comers making it affordable for everybody, and there is no need to buy tickets (but better reserve a seat ;)!</p>
<p>A menu of monologues and dialogues will be handed out to the guests in bars and restaurants: they can choose to taste which and as many acts they want to see in a very personal atmosphere.</p>
<p>So here is how it works:</p>
<p>-you go to the cafè where we perform<br/>-you have a LOOK AT OUR THEATRICAL MENU<br/>-you discuss YOUR OPTIONS WITH YOUR FRIENDS OR TABLE MATES<br/>-you ORDER YOUR CHOICES TO THE THEATRE WAITER<br/>-just wait and the actor WILL ENTERTAIN YOU AT YOUR TABLE!</p>
<p>yes, an unique experience!</p>
<p>Since the beginning we have done 20 events in just 3 months, moving from bars to restaurants, from area to area. We act in 4 different languages - <em>German, English, Spanish, Italian </em>- in order to make it more accessible and have a wider range of audience in this international city.</p>
<p>We also want to further develop our project creating different big performances connected to our concept.</p>
<p>Since now we have been working from our personal expenses trying to give always the best to our audience.</p>
<p>We want even more of you to be able to experience our shows and enjoy our events, and that's why we need your support!</p>
<p>Your contributions are going directly towards helping us RENT A SPACE for our rehearsals and performances, and a bit for letting us take a breath for the full time administration job.</p>
<p>When we act as Theater am Tisch we don't need tickets and we want to offer the public what they would like to enjoy for very reasonable prices.  Because of this, we need also to ask your help so that we have coverage for the next few months for our new weekly, monthly and one shot shows as well as team training programs.</p>
<p>We're breaking it down this way:</p>
<p>Rent/Utilities for 3 months: €2500<br/>Breath for the whole team for 3 months: €4500<br/>Administration help: €1000</p>
<p>Which gives us a grand total of €8000 (10170 $).</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>So why are we asking for your support</h3>
<p>Art, theatre should be accessible to all. We aren't selling tickets for our events and we keep really low prices to make it affordable. But this doesnt mean that our actors should not be paid to share their talents, transport themselves to and from rehearsal and maybe buy a drink after the show. We would like to provide our audience (that it is you!!) with food during the performance, as we act at the table!</p>
<p>In order to provide such sustenance to our actors and for better performances to our audiences, we need your financial support.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>And if you donate what do you get?</h3>
<p>A lot of nice perks and the knowledge that you are supporting a locally grown international group of professional actors that want to share their passion to everybody through this new concept.</p>
<p>Dont worry, if you are not Berlin based we have ready nice perks just for you!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>In addition to a donation, you can also help us spread the word!  </p>
<p>If you cant contribute we'd still like you to help us sharing our campaign on your many interweb social networking sites and try to come to one of our next events. </p>

We are excited to announce that we will perform at The Camden Fringe Festival from the 16th to the 20th of August at the Etcetera Theatre. We are seeking the support from backers and crowd funders to help us give our show the platform it deserves: an International festival in the theatre capitol of the world.But, while on the stage, with mime we can create everything from nothing. In reality, we discovered  that the imagination is not enough ( you can not go to London with an imaginery plane).In order to create everything from nothing we actually need something. We need your support to help us cover some essential costs. We aim to raise £2,000. Here is a breakdown of the costs:
£650   Accomodation
£450   Flight tickets
£300   Venue hire
£270   Technician and technical hire
£120   Travel (in London for a week)
£100   Promotion
£99     Camden Fringe Festival registration
£11     Contingency (we are optimistic)
It’s not easy for a young and independent company producing its own show, but the thing that we discovered after spending years doing devised theatre is that expressing your own creativity with freedom and passion is the real purpose of life.Our Way To Say THANK YOUAnd this is the best part. For your support we will do things that nobody has done for you before...in your entire life. The biggest prize is our entire show in your house! (yes, nobody has done OUR show in your house). We will make personalized videos and pictures of us doing anything you want ( stuff like riding an elephant or floating around the moon).

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>Stephanie Unger &amp; Artists is an East Bay collaborative contemporary dance theatre project that focuses on telling stories of human emotions and experiences. After our recent show, “What Is She Doing?,” Stephanie Unger &amp; Artists is hosting a festival to continue the conversation. We have asked “How do you experience society’s pressures upon womxn?” to a wide variety of artists and have selected a broad range of voices. This festival, entitled Broad Statements, will be March 6, 7, and 8, 2020 and will showcase a variety of artists from the Bay Area and beyond. Your support of this campaign will allow the artists the possibility of receiving a portion of the ticket sales.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We are seeking to cover the costs of the venue rental and marketing for the festival. Having these costs covered by this fundraising campaign will allow a portion of the ticket sales to be allocated to the presenting artists. </p>
<p>In exchange for your support, we have a variety of exciting perks! From swag items to show tickets and VIP treatment, you won’t be disappointed with what you get for the money you donate.</p>
<p>This is a fundraiser has a flexible goal. While that means that Indiegogo will take a percentage of the funds we raise, it also means that it’s not “all or nothing.” All donations will go directly to support the artists of Broad Statements.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>“Broad Statements” is an excellent project to give dancers and choreographers of all gender expressions and backgrounds a public forum to embody and express their perspectives on womxnhood. With so much interest in the wider culture in women’s representation and increasing focus on gender politics, we think it’s important in 2020 for the arts to engage with the broad spectrum of pressure upon womxn and womxn’s experiences in society.</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Stephanie Unger &amp; Artists, the host company for the festival, has successfully produced two evening-length shows. Both of those shows were fully funded by private donations, including Indiegogo campaigns.</p>
<p>If we are not able to reach our goal, we will not be able to fully allocate ticket sales to the presenting artists. The more support we can receive, the more the artists are paid for their valuable work.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Share this campaign! Email, social media, or even just tell a friend.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>I have always been a fan of great stories that not only touched, scared, shocked, excited, or just made you feel but that also left you thinking; contemplating the ever reaching possibilities of imagined circumstances and the real world reactions in your own life. I have a passionate love affair with these types of stories and those who tell them. It is that passion that drives me to tell stories that are not only interesting, but that you hopefully take with you for some time after the show. My mission with <strong><em>IMAGINATIVE REALITY PRODUCTIONS</em></strong> is to give life to inspiring and thought-provoking creations of the highest standards of quality for print media, internet content, film &amp; television, and the stage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>IRIS</em></strong> is no different. In a nutshell, it is basically about a young woman's journey through hell, but going deeper, it explores our life's decisions - the causes and the known/unforseen consequences of those decisions. Too many times we don't think about them until it's too late. I hope that this show gets people to think about the decisions they make, and how they might have a bigger consequence than just right now...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now with Dan Martin set to direct the piece, we have a powerful opportunity to reach so many more people with this and it will help to springboard us into the new year and give us unique opportunities to help other deserving creative artists showcase their talents on film, the web, and on stage!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>""<em>I believe that true artists are touched by God to inspire and encourage His children; to reveal the very best and worst of ourselves, that we can move closer to what He dreams of us becoming. True artists are very often deemed crazy because they often don't think like the normal of society, but they're artists... who would want them to. Just sit back and enjoy the show, for to watch a true artist at work is to see a miracle happen before your very eyes. I am forever an artist and a fan of any artist in the never ending search of perfection in their craft.</em>""</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This piece is one that I believe can truly help others and obviously I'm not alone! We've brought on board our team R.A.I.N.N. (Rape Abuse Incest National Network - <a href=""http://www.rainn.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.rainn.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.rainn.org</a>) and will be donating part of the proceeds from the show to this very worthwhile and much needed charity. Proceeds from the show will also be going to benefit OUR COMMITMENT, INC (<a href=""http://www.ourcommitment.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.ourcommitment.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.ourcommitment.org</a>), a non-profit organization whose myriad of projects and programs are constantly helping to change and impact our communities across the nation in a positive manner!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This will be my 4th stage production that I have written and produced, and with your help, the best one yet. IRIS will be the launching pad for me in this coming year to help me bring quality entertainment with a thought-provoking &amp; inspiring message to as many people as possible. By helping us with a donation and spreading the word about the play, you become an integral part of this success story. Success garnered not from the amount of dollars earned (although, let's be real, that does count), but by the people who are touched and inspired and made to think and consider.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With a lot of hard work, perseverence, and dedication, we will start in Los Angeles and travel across the country and eventually the world, inpiring and challenging audiences all over to think, be better, and achieve more. The universal messages in any of my pieces are designed to resonate with anyone from anywhere. Life's universal truths speak to us all differently, but they always speak to us, and I believe that we can spur on that conversation between each other and make a positive impact in our neighborhood, society, country, and world.<br/></p>

<p>Seven League Boots is an innovative new theatre company dedicated to breaking down traditional barriers between audience and performance. We create theatre that actively engages audiences and invites them to engage with us in return. We have spent the past year building a strong foundation for our company and we are excited to launch our inaugural season.</p>
<h2>WHY INTERACTIVE THEATRE?</h2>
<p>Theatre is too often a passive experience. Whether watching Hamlet recite his famous soliloquy or Spiderman swing from the rafters, audience members are frequently disconnected from the art happening directly in front of them.</p>
<p>But what if you could ask Hamlet why he is so depressed? What if he answered? What if Spiderman asked for your help to find his nemesis and save the day? What if he couldn’t do it without you?</p>
<p>We at Seven League Boots believe in the transformative power of live performance. There is magic in that unique relationship between audience member and performer; it is there that theatre can nurture the exchange of ideas, promote positive human interaction, and foster engagement in a community.</p>
<p>Everything we do will strengthen that relationship. Our audiences will know that their actions and ideas matter.</p>
<h2>HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THAT?</h2>
<p>We are currently in the process of building our first season, which will include experiences in three categories:</p>
<h3>For Audiences</h3>
<p>Interactive productions of both original and existing works that invite audiences to experience live performance in new and exciting ways. At a Seven League Boots show, you’ll be so involved, you may even influence the outcome.</p>
<h3>For Artists</h3>
<p>Professional development workshops in varied disciplines made available and affordable to our fellow artists.</p>
<h3>For Students</h3>
<p>Performances and master classes that bring our unique brand of theatre into schools and make learning come alive for students of all ages.</p>
<p><em>Check out a sneak peek of our first project, </em>Robin Hood in a Box<em>, in our Gallery!</em></p>
<h2>WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP </h2>
<p>We are committed to breaking down barriers not only between the audience and the performance, but also the traditional barriers to seeing theatre in the first place. In New York City in particular, theatre ticket prices are prohibitively expensive. </p>
<p>We can’t change the price of existing Broadway shows, but we will offer our own theatrical experiences at an affordable price.</p>
<p>In order to share our vision and bring accessible interactive theatre to our community, we need your help to build a modest operating budget for the year.</p>
<p>We can’t do it alone, so let’s do it together! (hey, like our mission!)</p>
<h2>WHERE DOES YOUR DONATION GO?</h2>
<p>Your generous donations contribute to our mission in many ways, for example:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">As little as $5 creates handcrafted bracelets for 25 children at our shows and workshops – these bracelets are an integral part of our <em>Robin Hood in a Box</em> show, a symbol that each child is now part of Robin Hood’s merry band and a token for them to remember the show and their role in the story.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">$50 covers minimum transportation costs for our entire company to and from a single school show or workshop in the NYC area, potentially reaching up to 500 children.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">$500 allows us to rent rehearsal space to create and polish a full production.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">$2000 buys us costumes and props for a period-specific show, such as those focused on Robin Hood, the Victorian era, or one of the Shakespeare productions we are currently planning. </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">$5000 rents a theater space for the entire production run of a single show.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Finally, $10,000 can bring our company and our mission to theaters and festivals across the country, allowing us to reach a whole new audience.</p>
<p>We know you work hard for your money, and your choice to donate to our cause humbles us and drives our ambition to create theatre of the highest attainable quality. We promise to use every penny you donate in the most efficient, effective manner possible. </p>
<h2>ABOUT OUR NAME</h2>
<p>Seven League Boots have existed in folklore for centuries, allowing the wearer to travel incredible distances in a single step. Like our mythical counterparts, we will take you on a journey someplace new, to experience theatre as you never have before. </p>
<p>Together, we’ll go farther. With each step, we’ll take you seven leagues...</p>
<h2>PLEASE HELP IF YOU CAN </h2>
<p>We invite you to be part of the change, helping us bring art to audiences in a whole new way and thereby changing their perception of and interaction with art in the world around them.</p>
<p>If you are unable to donate, that is perfectly fine. We appreciate your support in simply reading this far! You can also help us by sharing this Indiegogo campaign, Liking us on Facebook, following us on Twitter, and telling your friends about “this exciting new company I heard about....” </p>

WHAT IS GOOD TIME TORTURE?
The Good Time Torture Campaign is a competitive fundraiser to support The Island Theatre Company's 2nd producing season in 2013.  
Every week, a new contestant will be assigned a challenge by the GOOD TIME TORTURE band.  This challenge is based on special creative skills each contestant submits prior to participating.  Video footage of each challenge will be posted to Facebook.com/IslandTheatreCo every Monday throughout the campaign.  You, the audience, will then have 7 days to vote whether each contestant is rewarded or punished for their effort. 
 
WHAT DO YOU MEAN - REWARDED OR PUNISHED? 

Prior to competing, each contestant also submits a list of their wishes and fears.  THE GOOD TIME TORTURE band uses this information to create a musical video, with the contestant, for your enjoyment.  Reward videos will feature the contestant's wishes, while punishment videos will exploit their fears.  
Each video will also be released at Facebook.com/IslandTheatreCo, during our GOOD TIME TORTURE GRAND FINALE, towards the final days of our campaign.  So, once you donate to reward or punish a contestant, stay tuned to see their wildest dreams or deepest fears come true!
 
HOW DO I VOTE?
To reward this week's contestant, you may donate any amount ending in $8. 
To punish this week's contestant, you may donate any amount ending in $9.
 
IS THERE ANY OTHER WAY TO VOTE?  I REALLY WANT TO PUNISH THAT GUY!
Every Facebook ""like"" that we earn at Facebook.com/IslandTheatreCo will count as 1 vote for this week's contestant.  So, if you've already donated, but really wanna stick it to this week's contestant, send our video to a few friends and ask them for their support.  After you like The Island, you can send us a message, a wall post, or tag us in a comment indicating ""REWARD"" or ""PUNISHMENT"".
 
OKAY.  BUT WHAT IS ""THE ISLAND THEATRE COMPANY""?
The Island is a theatre collective based in Chicago, Illinois.  Our mission is to immerse audiences in theatrical events that examine what it means to be alive - here, now, and next to each other.  
2012 marked the first producing season of The Island Theatre Company, but it was actually founded in 2009.  Since then, The Island has grown into 12 versatile ensemble members, 2 Artistic Associates, and a full executive staff.  It is with terrific momentum and enthusiasm that we greet 2013.

WHAT SHOWS WILL THE ISLAND BE PRODUCING IN 2013?
The Island's 2013 Mainstage Season
The Fever
Written by Wallace Shawn                                                                                        
Performed by Quinten Quintero* and Derek Van Barham
March 7 - April 7, 2013

In our first production of 2013, two actors will be going on a tour of Chicago livng rooms performing Wallace Shawn's Obie Award-winning play, The Fever.  While visiting a poverty-stricken country far from home, the unnamed narrator of The Fever is forced to witness the political persecution occuring just beyond his hotel window.  In examining a life of comfort and relative privilege, the narrator reveals, ""I always say to my friends, we should be glad to be alive.  We should celebrate life.  We should understand that life is wonderful.""  But how does one understand life - take pleasure in beauty, for instance - while slowly becoming aware that the poverty and oppression of other human beings are a direct consequence of one's own pleasureable life?  Audiences have the option of booking the performer of their choice for a date and time convenient to them for a private, in-home viewing of the play especially for them and whoever they choose to invite!

The Glass Inward
Directed by Anna Henson** and Mike Steele* 
Featuring Shawn Escarciga, Ellen Kirk*, Quinten Quintero*, and Jennie Winston*
August 2013

 Inspired by the novel Orlando by Virginia Woolf, this walk-through performance installation gives viewers an immersive look at one of the most unique protagonists ever to appear in modern literature.  Utilizing live performance, film, photography, projection, and installation design, this event brings us up close and personal with the main character's many affairs and tribulations, which are encountered first as a man and later as a woman following a mysterious transformation.  This sweeping, surreal story takes the audience across landscapes, through centuries, and deep into the heart of a wayward soul.  
 
The Patient
Written by Sam Hicks*
October - November 2013
This noir retelling of the French horror story Le Horla by Guy de Maupassant has been translated from the French and adapted for the stage by Island Ensemble Member Sam Hicks.  The claustrophobic play tests the boundaries of truth and memory as its characters are forced to face a terrifying question: what will succeed humanity as the master of our planet? This suspense-filled thriller will premiere just in time for Halloween. 
 
The Island's Second Helping Series
These theatrical oddities will also be produced during 2013 as special limited-run events.

SHARK/MAN
 

Written by Frederick Ford Beckley*

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.drivetheatre.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">Drive Theatre Company</a> is a brand new Los Angeles-based theatre company that's dedicated to producing bold American plays.  Co-artistic directors <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pub/timothy-koch/24/565/452"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">Timothy Koch</a> and <a href=""http://www.dougoliphant.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">Doug Oliphant</a> founded Drive Theatre in late 2011 over several milkshakes, slices of pie, and beer.  With Drive Theatre, we're paving a road for us to gain valuable experience as directors and provide the same opportunity for other emerging artists--actors, playwrights, designers, etc.--so that we may one day emerge as nationally working theatre artists.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In pursuit of connecting with the national theatre community, we've secured performance rights for our inaugural production, <i><a href=""http://playsforpresidents.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">44 Plays for 44 Presidents</a> </i>by <a href=""http://andybayiates.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">Andy Bayiates</a>, et al.  Our production will be part of a national festival whose hope is to have 44 separate productions of the play happen concurrently around the country on the night of the 2012 presidential election.  Major players already a part of the festival include Chicago's <a href=""http://www.neofuturists.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">Neo-Futurists</a> and Atlanta's <a href=""http://dadsgarage.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">Dad's Garage</a>.  Drive Theatre Company is the sole company representing Los Angeles.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>On a more immediate level, we're producing a monthly new play development series where we work with a new playwright each month.  The process will culminate in two or three workshop performances of the play put up in various spaces around Los Angeles.  For the month of March, recent New York City transplant <a href=""http://www.stevesherman.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">Steve Sherman</a> will be our featured playwright.  His play <i>Stained Glass Windows</i> will receive its workshop production with us before going on to its world premiere this September at <a href=""http://orlandoshakes.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">Orlando Shakespeare Theater</a> in Orlando, Florida.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This fundraising campaign is dedicated to helping Drive Theatre Company get started and establish a base-budget.  By donating, you will be enabling us to carry out our monthly new play development series, benefiting new playwrights, directors and actors in Los Angeles.  Your contributions will also go toward funding <i>44 Plays for 44 Presidents</i>, set to open October 11th, 2012 and run for 13 performances, closing on election night.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Without your help, such ambitions would not be possible.  We would not represent Los Angeles in the national Plays for Presidents festival, we would not develop new plays each month, and we and our peers would not grow as theatre artists through this company.  Your donation matters.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $7,000 to produce <i>44 Plays for 44 Presidents</i> alone.  We're only hoping to raise $2,500 through this initial campaign, much of which will go toward expenses accrued from the new play development series and our basic start-up costs.  Over the next 6 months, we'll be raising additional funds through our monthly new play development series, specialty workshops and various fun, carnival-style events at local establishments. Here's how that $2500 is being distributed:</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul>
<li>
<i><b>44 Plays for 44 Presidents</b></i> - Reimbursing us for performance rights and scripts purchased <b>($1042.81) </b>and covering a small portion of upcoming production expenses <b>($500)</b><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Start-Up Costs</b> - Reimbursing us for website domain/hosting/template/design software, business cards, meeting expenses and the 7% fee IndieGoGo and credit cards deduct from total raised in this campaign <b>(approx. $400)</b>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Spread the word!  Word-of-mouth is the best way to get people interested, but utilizing social media is pretty great too.  Share this on Facebook, Tweet about it on Twitter, even email someone you think may be interested in helping.  Through your help, we'll reach far more people and you become a vital force behind our success.</p>
</div></div>","Our Story
Drive Theatre Company is a brand new Los Angeles-based theatre company that's dedicated to producing bold American plays.  Co-artistic directors Timothy Koch and Doug Oliphant founded Drive Theatre in late 2011 over several milkshakes, slices of pie, and beer.  With Drive Theatre, we're paving a road for us to gain valuable experience as directors and provide the same opportunity for other emerging artists--actors, playwrights, designers, etc.--so that we may one day emerge as nationally working theatre artists.

In pursuit of connecting with the national theatre community, we've secured performance rights for our inaugural production, 44 Plays for 44 Presidents by Andy Bayiates, et al.  Our production will be part of a national festival whose hope is to have 44 separate productions of the play happen concurrently around the country on the night of the 2012 presidential election.  Major players already a part of the festival include Chicago's Neo-Futurists and Atlanta's Dad's Garage.  Drive Theatre Company is the sole company representing Los Angeles.

On a more immediate level, we're producing a monthly new play development series where we work with a new playwright each month.  The process will culminate in two or three workshop performances of the play put up in various spaces around Los Angeles.  For the month of March, recent New York City transplant Steve Sherman will be our featured playwright.  His play Stained Glass Windows will receive its workshop production with us before going on to its world premiere this September at Orlando Shakespeare Theater in Orlando, Florida.  


The Impact
This fundraising campaign is dedicated to helping Drive Theatre Company get started and establish a base-budget.  By donating, you will be enabling us to carry out our monthly new play development series, benefiting new playwrights, directors and actors in Los Angeles.  Your contributions will also go toward funding 44 Plays for 44 Presidents, set to open October 11th, 2012 and run for 13 performances, closing on election night.

Without your help, such ambitions would not be possible.  We would not represent Los Angeles in the national Plays for Presidents festival, we would not develop new plays each month, and we and our peers would not grow as theatre artists through this company.  Your donation matters.


What We Need & What You Get
We need $7,000 to produce 44 Plays for 44 Presidents alone.  We're only hoping to raise $2,500 through this initial campaign, much of which will go toward expenses accrued from the new play development series and our basic start-up costs.  Over the next 6 months, we'll be raising additional funds through our monthly new play development series, specialty workshops and various fun, carnival-style events at local establishments. Here's how that $2500 is being distributed:



44 Plays for 44 Presidents - Reimbursing us for performance rights and scripts purchased ($1042.81) and covering a small portion of upcoming production expenses ($500)


Start-Up Costs - Reimbursing us for website domain/hosting/template/design software, business cards, meeting expenses and the 7% fee IndieGoGo and credit cards deduct from total raised in this campaign (approx. $400)


New Play Development Series - Over the next 6 months, we'll be paying for copies of scripts, ink, basic props, set pieces, and potential rehearsal/performance fees (approx. $600)

<p>Hi my name is Carlos Milan, I have been an actor on and off for over 30 years. I am trying to bring the fabulous and very timely play ""Men On The Verge Of A His-Panic Breakdown"" by Guillermo Reyes (Produced by special arrangement with The Dramatic Publishing Company of Woodstock, Illinois) to the stage for one final performance, mine, before I am too old to play Federico!</p>
<p>I performed this show in the past and was very well received by the audience. Reading the script recently I realized how timely and topical the issues covered in it are. Twenty years and we are still talking about immigration, gay marriage, what it means to be American, war, terror, and our endless search for love and a community to belong to.</p>
<p>By contributing to this campaign you will help me bring to the audience, in a funny and insightful way, the vicissitudes of being gay, hispanic and an immigrant in America, although some of the themes are universal and cross gender and ethnic lines. (Produced by special arrangement with The Dramatic Publishing Company of Woodstock, Illinois)</p>
<p><strong>Dates</strong></p>
<p>Nov. 2, 3, 9, 10, 16, 17 @ 8 pm</p>

<p>At <strong>The L-Train, 900 Central Avenue, St. Petersburg. </strong></p>
<p><strong>For more information, please call 727-265-5898<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Synopsis <br/></strong></p>
""Men On The Verge Of A His-Panic Breakdown"" by Guillermo Reyes. is a series of comedic monologues, which the New York Times called ""Glorious,"" chronicling the lives of various Latino immigrants dealing with transcultural shock of race and gender identity known as the ""Hispanic breakdown."" The play is bracketed by the misadventures of the naive Frederico or ""The Gay Little Immigrant That Could"" who arrives in Los Angeles during the first day of the 1992 riots and culminates with his assimilation into the American fabric. He is here to stay! Other characters include Vinnie, a kept boy being asked to leave the home of his wealthy sugar daddy because he's turned 30 and sees himself forced to find a new place and identity; Edward, a Latino actor passing for Anglo who gets a Latino part and has to come to terms with his real identity; the Demon Roommate, a lonely young man, the son of Chile's leading torturer and the impact of that upbringing while living a little too close to the airport; Paco, a Cuban restauranteur who was imprisoned by the Communists in Cuba for being gay and has now been exiled by his right-wing Miami family for the same reason; the Teacher, a stuffy, sexually repressed English-language instructor who abuses his Latino students when they can't learn properly the ""language of Princess Di""; and La Gitana, a drag Flamenco dancer struggling with AIDS as he stages his final performance. The play ends with Federico's final misadventure as he tells of his newly found romance, a better job and his acquisition of citizenship in a grand, positive finale. ""Some of the characters seem to be hanging onto their American existence by a thread, but make no mistake, these are tough, tenacious men."" <br/><p><strong>Where will your funds go to:</strong></p>
<p>All funds will go toward paying for the venue, royalties, costumes, props, advertising materials. The actor, the stage manager, lighting, photographer, etc. are doing this because of their passion for theatre. Once all costs associated with the production are met, we hope to provide a stipend to the wonderful cast and crew that will be working on the show. If our goal is not met by the deadline, I am not sure how we'll do it, but we will put on the show regardless. Who knows, maybe if it's a rousing success we can take it on tour. These guys need their voices heard. Thanks Guillermo Reyes, for given them the chance.</p>
<p>To those who are unable to make a contribution, please consider coming to see the show or spread the word about it. Shout it from rooftops if necessary. Ok, that last thing may be a bit too much. But please support us and support local theatre in your communities. And always keep on keeping on!</p>
<p>With my utmost gratitude,</p>
<p>Carlos Milan and the Little Players that Could. </p>

The result is an intoxicating and incantatory verse play unlike any other, set to a genre-bending original score performed live by multi-instrumentalist Sean Cronin.

<p><b>What is miR theater?</b></p>
<p>Almost four years ago, while on a camping trip outside Chicago, my husband, <a href=""http://www.josephlarkriley.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Joseph Lark-Riley</a>, and I became ignited by an idea that would become miR theater.   From that moment to this we have been creating the foundation for this company and for our first production, <i>Cereus Moonlight.</i>  </p>
<p>Joseph and I have worked as theater artists both together and separately in New Orleans, Chicago, and New York for the past 15 years.  On that camping trip we realized that we wanted to keep making theater, but we wanted to do it in a beautiful small town surrounded by people we love.   Three years and a Master’s Degree in arts administration later, we are in Rockledge, Florida, Joseph’s hometown and the home of miR, made in Rockledge.  It’s a theater company devoted to the creation, production, and presentation of original work.  We’re here to be a part of a movement that tells rich regional stories of smaller places that often get lost in the New York-centric theater world.  Our ultimate goal is to create an artistic hub here in Rockledge.  We want miR to be a place where community members can gather and find art, music, films or theater any night of the week.  All of it made in Rockledge.</p>
<p>Our first production, <i>Cereus Moonlight</i>, is a kind of love song to Rockledge and to all of those out of the way but utterly fascinating small towns in this country.  Through original story-telling, music, live performance, scenography and puppetry this play attempts to capture the essence of Rockledge while celebrating universal themes and questions that connect humans all over the world.</p>
<p>The premiere of <i>Cereus Moonlight</i> is scheduled for <b>January 17th through the 26th</b> at the <a href=""http://www.cityofrockledge.org/Pages/RockledgeFL_WebDocs/Facilities/MunicipalBldg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Historic Rockledge Municipal Building</a>, which we will be transforming into a theater for two weekends.  Your contribution is essential to the success of this project and to the launch of miR theater.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>Our goal with this campaign is to raise $16,000.  These funds will cover costs for space rental, costumes, lighting, musicians fees, actors stipends, as well as travel and creator fees for our two artists-in-residence: <a href=""http://www.pittsburghmagazine.com/Pittsburgh-Magazine/May-2013/The-Write-Way/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sarah Shotland</a>, our playwright, and <a href=""http://www.jessicafogle.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jessica Fogle</a>, our composer.  Additionally we’ll need to purchase materials to construct our spectacular transformable set and 11 hand-crafted puppets.  Finally, miR has been invited to present <i>Cereus Moonlight</i> at the <a href=""http://www.rhinofest.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rhinoceros Theater Festival</a> in Chicago and we are seeking funds to transport the entire production to the Windy City following the premiere here in Rockledge.</p>
<p>To express our gratitude for your generous contributions, we have created some very special perks including limited edition postcard-sized prints of Joseph’s original sketches for the set and puppets, as well as a beautifully bound book containing the original script and images, an art piece in and of itself.</p>
<p>It is important that we reach our entire funding goal in order to complete this project the way we have envisioned it and to share this story with as wide an audience as possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>miR theater is the first theater company dedicated to original theater in Brevard County.  It will be the only theater company based in the City of Rockledge.  By contributing to this campaign, you are not only funding an exciting and brand new piece of theater but you are helping to lay the foundation for a company that will be bringing something entirely new to Central Florida.  In a larger sense (for our friends and colleagues outside of Florida) you are helping to fund a movement to create unique cultural outlets in places where they have been absent.  You are helping to ensure that theater artists have more choices than just heading for the big cities to make their careers, and you are becoming a part of a call to uncover the rich and beautiful stories of unsung places.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>We are incredibly grateful for any and all contributions, no matter how small. Every donation will have an impact on this project.  However, we understand that some of you will not be able to contribute.  But you can still help!  Please spread the word, tell your friends and family about this unique project and what it will mean to this county and to the movement for cultural organizations in small towns.  There are tools to easily share this campaign on your social media outlet of choice.  The more people who know about this campaign, the greater chance we have of being successfully funded!</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your time and consideration.  We are so thankful for you!</p><p></p></div>","What is miR theater?

<p></p></div>","Short Summary
  My name is Sarah Cassell, and I’m producing Bat Boy, an independent student project at Syracuse University. The
entire cast and creative team consists of SU Drama students, with the exception
of our director, Rodney Hudson, who is a member of the musical theater faculty.
This is an incredibly talented, dedicated, and passionate group of people. We
have everything we need to put together a fantastic show – except the last leg
of our funding. 
We will be doing Bat Boy: The Musical, with music and lyrics by Lawrence O’Keefe and
book by Brian Flemming and Keythe Farley. Based on the sci-fi news tabloid The Weekly World News, the show is about
a part-boy, part-bat creature found in a cave outside a small farming town. As
he begins to learn language, culture, and religion, all he wants is to be
accepted by society. However, the more he tries to assimilate, the more he is
rejected and turned into a scapegoat by the townspeople. This cult-hit
tragicomedy has a unique, campy voice that uses humor to illuminate the
cruelties of prejudice, revenge, and hypocrisy. 
Above all, this is an amazing performance opportunity for the students
involved. We have an INCREDIBLE cast and production team.

What We Need & What You Get
We’re hoping to raise $1,000 to cover the cost of props, lighting,
marketing, costumes, and set pieces. 
 We have been given grants
from the Renee Crown University Honors Program and the Department of Drama to
cover the cost of the venue, accompanist, and performance rights. Those are our
biggest, most pressing expenses, but now we need your help to fund the fun and
creative stuff. Here are a few of the most interesting expenses your donation
would go towards:
·      Human-sized cage
·      Paper mache cow head
·      Prosthetic ears and fangs
·      Stage blood
·      Wheelchair
·      Bowie knife
·      And much, MUCH more**
The funding we have been given by the university has been incredibly
generous, but in order to tell this story the way we want to tell it, we need more.
We have raised the money to make this show possible; now we need to raise the
money to make possible our artistic goals for this show. 
Even the smallest donation would help. Any amount of money will bring us
closer to our goal. If you can’t donate, we would appreciate it if you could
pass it on to your friends and family! Spread the word – we are so close to our
goal and we are passionate about making this show as amazing as it has the
potential to be.

</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Purple Crayon Players is a student-run theatre company on the 
Northwestern University campus committed to creating high quality 
productions, events, and educational materials regarding all aspects of 
theatre for young audiences. Purple Crayon Players believes that 
audiences of all ages can appreciate, be inspired by, and grow through 
exposure to this unique art form.
</p>
<p>We produce a mainstage season of professionally written works for
 young audiences, while also sponsoring high quality outreach events, 
educational events, and special projects for audiences of all ages both 
on campus and in the outlying community. These events support the 
mainstage season, as well as explore other aspects of theatre, community
 service, and learning.

<h3>WHAT IS ""SHE KILLS MONSTERS"" ABOUT?<br/>
</h3> <p></p>When Agnes inherits Tilly’s old Dungeons &amp; Dragons module, she 
enlists the aide of local Dungeon Master Chuck to enter the 
action-packed imaginary kingdom of Tilly’s refuge. As she delves deeper 
into New Landia—a world of murderous fairies, cheerleading succubae, and
 five-headed dragons— Agnes begins to discover secrets even she did not 
know about her sister. With only her wits, ‘90s pop culture, and 
untapped warrior skills to guide her, Agnes sets off to save her 
sister’s soul—and perhaps her own.
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?<br/>
</h3> Kicking off Purple Crayon Players' 11th season, SHE KILLS MONSTERS is a massive undertaking for the board. Here's a brief list of things we're budgeting for the show:<br/> <ul> <li>Outreach efforts into the greater Chicago area to bring kids from high schools and youth groups in to see the show<br/>
</li> <li>Design elements (costumes/makeup/sets/props) to bring the vibrant world of Dungeons and Dragons to life on the McCormick Auditorium stage<br/>
</li> <li>Technical elements (light/sound) to give the production atmosphere and feel professional in production. <br/>
</li>
<li>Rights/space rental/etc.<br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>WHY SHOULD I SUPPORT THIS?<br/>
</h3>
<p>SHE KILLS MONSTERS is part of an ongoing push by Purple Crayon Players to expand the field of Theatre for Young Audiences to include stories about high school age teens, as well as tackling more complex and vital issues for younger ages. SHE KILLS MONSTERS touches on subjects as varied as sexual identity, depression, grief from loss, outsiderism, disability, and alternate subcultures. Purple Crayon Players sees it as vital to educate youth about these issues as soon as possible, so that they grow into more open-minded, accepting, and understanding individuals.<br/></p>
<ul></ul> </div> <div> <h3>I WANT TO SUPPORT THIS, BUT I CAN'T DONATE ON INDIEGOGO FOR SOME REASON. HOW CAN I HELP OUT?<br/>
</h3> <p>There are plenty of ways to help out!<br/></p> <ul> <li>Come to a bakesale! There will be two bakesales, both from 9am to 5pm, on October 5 and 21 in the Torso Lobby at Northwestern's Wirtz Center for the Performing Arts.<br/>
</li> <li>Come to the Children's Book Bash event! On October 9th in Harris 107 (near the Rock) we will be hosting an evening of readings from books we've read from our childhoods. No cover charge, though donations are accepted!</li>
<li>Send your donations directly though the mail! Cash, as well as checks made out to ""NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY"" can be sent to Zach Barr at the following address: 641 Library Pl., Apt. 1, Evanston, IL 60201</li>

 Kicking off Purple Crayon Players' 11th season, SHE KILLS MONSTERS is a massive undertaking for the board. Here's a brief list of things we're budgeting for the show:  Outreach efforts into the greater Chicago area to bring kids from high schools and youth groups in to see the show
 Design elements (costumes/makeup/sets/props) to bring the vibrant world of Dungeons and Dragons to life on the McCormick Auditorium stage
 Technical elements (light/sound) to give the production atmosphere and feel professional in production. 

Rights/space rental/etc.
    WHY SHOULD I SUPPORT THIS?

SHE KILLS MONSTERS is part of an ongoing push by Purple Crayon Players to expand the field of Theatre for Young Audiences to include stories about high school age teens, as well as tackling more complex and vital issues for younger ages. SHE KILLS MONSTERS touches on subjects as varied as sexual identity, depression, grief from loss, outsiderism, disability, and alternate subcultures. Purple Crayon Players sees it as vital to educate youth about these issues as soon as possible, so that they grow into more open-minded, accepting, and understanding individuals.
   I WANT TO SUPPORT THIS, BUT I CAN'T DONATE ON INDIEGOGO FOR SOME REASON. HOW CAN I HELP OUT?
 There are plenty of ways to help out!  Come to a bakesale! There will be two bakesales, both from 9am to 5pm, on October 5 and 21 in the Torso Lobby at Northwestern's Wirtz Center for the Performing Arts.
 Come to the Children's Book Bash event! On October 9th in Harris 107 (near the Rock) we will be hosting an evening of readings from books we've read from our childhoods. No cover charge, though donations are accepted!
Send your donations directly though the mail! Cash, as well as checks made out to ""NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY"" can be sent to Zach Barr at the following address: 641 Library Pl., Apt. 1, Evanston, IL 60201
Come see the show! Performances are October 29-31 at McCormick Auditorium at Norris University Center at Northwestern University. Tickets are $5 for students and $10 for general admission. 
   Thanks, everyone.",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
I have been given the opportunity to serve as the Music Direction Intern at the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera this summer. The organization is one that is widely respected in the world of musical theatre. It functions as a Summer Stock job for aspiring actors and they often times hire big names for the leading roles.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>During the internship I will work alongside the music director to make sure everything music-wise goes according to plan. While interning I will be working on 42ND STREET, MAURY YESTON'S PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, and SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS. I am sure this will be a very informitive and amazing summer and could not be more excited!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The one downside to this internship is that it only helps offset the cost of living a small ammount. Because I currently pay rent for an appartment in Cincinnati and will now be taking on a sublet for the summer in Pittsburgh, I have decided to ask you for any help you may be willing to give!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This internship will allow me to work with professional and very established actors and musicians but it will also provide my resume for music direction with more credibility and ""WOW"" factor so getting a job in the real world will be a little easier! I thank you in advance for any dollar amount that you are able to contribute!</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
My goal for this fundraiser is $500 for the time I will be an intern. I must be in Pittsburgh for the first rehearsal on May 22, 2013 and will be done with the internship on June 22, 2013. The research I have done in regards to housing has shown me that the cheapest apartments near where I am working are in the $350 to $400 range and do not include utilities. In addition to the rent, I will also need to buy a bus pass so I am able to get to work in downtown Pittsburgh every day. If the goal is not met, anything will help offset the cost of this experience and I will be thankful for any amount I raise!</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
By donating to this fundraiser you are helping me realize my dreams of becoming a Music Director for shows on Broadway. Pittsburgh CLO is a very well respected organization that has a reputation of producing large, Broadway scale productions and I have been fortunate enough to be chosen for this prestigous internship. Helping me with the cost of housing will mean advancing my career after college and I believe that is worth investing in.</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
If you are not in the financial position to donate, DON'T WORRY! Please just help me spread the word by posting the link to this page on Facebook and sharing with family and friends!</div></div>","Short Summary

<strong> </strong>
</div><p><strong>New Room Theatre</strong> are an Edinburgh based theatre company bringing socially aware, often unheard, yet entertaining stories to the stage. You can find more information on what we do at <a href=""http://www.newroomtheatre.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.newroomtheatre.co.uk</a></p><div>
</div><p><strong>Blackout</strong> is a new play which looks at the lives of five recovering alcoholics and is coming to London after a critically acclaimed run in Edinburgh and Glasgow.

</div><p>New Room Theatre wholeheartedly welcomes this approach and we believe it is the way forward for all Fringe theatre.</p><div>
</div><p>We have already received amazing local support, from Blenheim Community Drug Project, and the Hope Theatre by giving us free rehearsal space. </p><div>

<p>“I'm interested in language. This play is curious about language and statelessness as forms, particularly displacement as a formal structure for a play. Displacement feels like America to me. The play is also very personal.  It draws upon different experiences I've had living both here and abroad. I believe the work brings forward some of the challenges to human dignity many people are facing right now. But ultimately I wanted to tell a theatrical story about life. Indeed a larger-than-life story that can only be told in a theater.” -- Phillip Howze, playwright</p>
<p><strong>FRONTIÉRES SANS FRONTIÈRES</strong> is a world-premiere play about friendship and holding on to your identity while outside forces try to pull you apart. </p>
<p>Our team of designers (<strong>Mariana Sanchez Hernandez</strong>, <strong>Seth Bodie</strong>, <strong>Masha Tsimring</strong>, <strong>Pornchanok Kanchanabanca</strong>), director <strong>Dustin Wills</strong>, and producers (<strong>Libby Peterson, Sally Shen, Alyssa Simmons</strong>) need your help to ensure audiences share in the spectacle that is FRONTIÉRES SANS FRONTIÈRES. </p>

</div></div>","“I'm interested in language. This play is curious about language and statelessness as forms, particularly displacement as a formal structure for a play. Displacement feels like America to me. The play is also very personal.  It draws upon different experiences I've had living both here and abroad. I believe the work brings forward some of the challenges to human dignity many people are facing right now. But ultimately I wanted to tell a theatrical story about life. Indeed a larger-than-life story that can only be told in a theater.” -- Phillip Howze, playwright
FRONTIÉRES SANS FRONTIÈRES is a world-premiere play about friendship and holding on to your identity while outside forces try to pull you apart. 
Our team of designers (Mariana Sanchez Hernandez, Seth Bodie, Masha Tsimring, Pornchanok Kanchanabanca), director Dustin Wills, and producers (Libby Peterson, Sally Shen, Alyssa Simmons) need your help to ensure audiences share in the spectacle that is FRONTIÉRES SANS FRONTIÈRES.

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>Hello!  Our names are John Heagy and Tom England and we are writers and performers from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  Growing up in respective small town upbringings we have always had a love of theater.  The ultimate goal for us is to make an impact on people's lives through the medium of theater, and we are fortunate enough to have been accepted into Take Ten Festival run by Between Us Productions in New York City.   We wrote our play,""Mr. Lockhardt,"" in an effort to re-conceptualize how inherent it is to fear. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Creating ""Mr. Lockhardt""</h3>
<p>""Mr. Lockhardt"" was written as a challenge to place ourselves in the shoes of person whose life has turned tragic in an instant.  We want to bring the emotions and experience of sudden tragedy to life on stage.  ""Mr. Lockhardt"" tells the story of a high school class whose lives become vulnerable and uncertain. The decisions these students make impact everyone around them and will ultimately reveal their true character. ""Mr. Lockhardt"" juxtaposes the image we have of ourselves against who we really are in times of crisis. </p>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge facing the production of ""Mr. Lockhardt"" is having sufficient funds to create a realistic scene.  Another challenge is physically bringing a show from Philadelphia to New York.  This is increasingly difficult because have not established a name for ourselves as this is our first production.  We have to bring our show to New York which requires fundraising. We are hopeful that this is our first step towards solidifying a name for ourselves in both Philadelphia and New York City. </p>
<h3>Where Does My Donation Go?</h3>
<p>In order for ""Mr. Lockhardt"" to succeed in New York we have to raise $3,200.  This $3,200 will purchase a set that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set and lighting equipment:  $1,200</li>
<li>Transport of the set from Philadelphia to New York: $200</li>
<li>Rehearsal space for a full month:  $200</li>
<li>Compensation for our cast and crew:  $1,600</li>
</ul>
<h3>For Me?</h3>
<p>As a thank you for your generous contribution to our production we have ""Mr. Lockhardt"" giveaways that we will be updating as the campaign progresses.  To start off, we will be giving away free ""Mr. Lockhardt"" t-shirts for any donation of at least $100!  We cannot express enough how grateful we are for your generosity, and we want to thank you for helping making our dream a reality.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Are There Other Ways I Can Help?</h3>
<p>Absolutely!  Now, while any size donation, either $1 or $1,000 is greatly appreciated, we understand that not everyone is able to contribute financially.  So how can you still help?  Talking about it!  Word of mouth will go just as far as a donation!  Tell your friends, family, post about the campaign on Facebook, share it, retweet it,  and help us get the story of ""Mr. Lockhardt"" to as many people as possible!  Follow us on Facebook: Lambert Strong Productions.

<p><strong>About Cardboard Playhouse Theatre Company</strong></p>
<p>Cardboard Playhouse Theatre Company, created by Doug Montoya and Kristin Berg in December 2004, prides itself on being one of the only children's theatre companies in Albuquerque that casts children on their ability to perform, not on their ability to pay. CPTC keeps itself viable by generating revenue through ticket sales and grants. CPTC was formed by a love of both improv and children, and fosters self expression, self confidence, and creativity through the use of an improv-based theatrical program. CPTC asks children to think for themselves and to take a sense of ownership in the show. To date Cardboard Playhouse has produced over 52 productions casting over a thousand local adult and child actors.</p>
<p>We are now at a point where we want to continue working with some of our alumni who have “aged out” to produce shows that are family friendly and fun! We have produced “Little Shop of Horrors,” “You’re a Good Man, Charlie Brown,” and “The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee” with our alumni actors. “Peter and the Starcatcher” is the next in this exciting series of alumni productions.</p>
<p>We are very excited to be doing this show with alumni actors and guest artists from the Albuquerque community.</p>
<p><strong>About Peter and the Starcatcher</strong></p>
<p>Tony-winning Peter and the Starcatcher upends the century-old story of how a miserable orphan comes to be The Boy Who Would Not Grow Up (a.k.a. Peter Pan). A wildly theatrical adaptation of Dave Barry and Ridley Pearson’s best-selling novels, the play was conceived for the stage by directors, Roger Rees and Alex Timbers, and written by Rick Elice, with music by Wayne Barker. From marauding pirates and jungle tyrants to unwilling comrades and unlikely heroes, Peter and the Starcatcher playfully explores the depths of greed and despair... and the bonds of friendship, duty and love.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p>Here are some of the many costs associated with mounting a production:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance rights</li>
<li>Pay for actors</li>
<li>Pay for Stage Manager</li>
<li>Marketing / Advertising</li>
<li>Sets</li>
<li>Props</li>
<li>Costumes</li>
<li>Rehearsal space</li>
<li>Production photos</li>
<li>Lighting/Sound</li>
</ul>
<p>All funds raised will go directly to producing Peter and the Starcatcher. Any profit in ticket sales will go to fund future Cardboard Playhouse shows.</p>
<p><strong>What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We have put together some awesome perks for the many levels of donations, but first and foremost, this is a great place to pre-purchase your tickets for Peter and the Starcatcher!!</p>

<p>So finally after 11 years of working on my autobiographical bilingual (English-Polish) one-man play titled INTRUDER|INTRUZ, my dreams of putting the play on are coming to fruition. The play tells a story of a young Polish man who comes to Scotland to make his dreams come true and become an actor but is a victim of traumatic events. </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>Remi's story ... </u></h3>
<p>Since I remember I've always wanted to be an actor. I actually never remember saying it but I remember my father replying 'Yes, you're going to be an actor  .......... after they burn down all the theatres'. Though, I always wanted to do it in English. After many disappointments in Poland and being told by quite a few professionals that I would never make it as an actor, I received an offer from the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland. Yes, but it took 14 years to get that offer.</p>
<p>At the drama school, I ran to my classes early morning to do my daily warm-ups but an incident in Edinburgh in March 2009 during the spring semester had a big impact on it. The same evening, I put it all on paper as a way of getting out my frustration. I wrote it 'being in the moment' and never thought I would ever make a play out of it. Actually, I never wanted to come back to the written account of the event and I put it in a drawer. It was that evening when the first 14 pages of INTRUDER were written. </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>Intruder | Intruz ... and the influences</u></h3>
<p>The account of the incident in Edinburgh became the foundation for my passion project. Originally, I wrote it in English with Polish elements and there is now a Polish version with English elements titled INTRUZ. I translated the piece into Polish as I wanted to share my story with so many Poles living in England. </p>
<p>The play is non-linear because I wanted it to have a structure of some of my favourite films e.g. Paul Thomas Anderson's 'Magnolia' or Christopher Nolan's 'Inception'. But it was Tom Ford's 'Nocturnal Animals' that helped me with the final re-structuring of the piece.   </p>
<p>INTRUDER|INTRUZ is very dynamic with the plot shifting in a split-second. It's interactive and performed in intimate spaces for the audience to be inside the events. It’s a very touching, moving, brutal, and forgiving tale with the elements of black humour that would keep the audience rooted to see how it is played out.  Very original, important and timely and with its current themes, it deserves to be told.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>Why is this play important?</u></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> <strong>mental health</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>anxiety</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong> forgiveness</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>  restorative justice system</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong> what it's like to be an immigrant</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>what it's like to be a victim of violence</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong> finally, making your dreams come true</strong></p>
<p>these themes of the play came up very organically and to be quite honest life wrote them. I found it very interesting and to some extent therapeutic to work on the play especially during the initial development of it in Glasgow in 2012. Looking at your own life and being told of certain patterns of behaviour is fascinating and made me think a lot about how I behave and what I do. Taking certain emotions e.g. feeling anxious, for granted and then being told, 'No, it's not ok, to feel this way' was very liberating especially when I met people who went through similar incidents and experienced similar emotions and feelings.</p>
<p>What added to the whole complexity of the story was the fact that my first language is Polish and I studied the English language and lived in Scotland when it all happened. Bilingualism is a key part of the whole story. 'In a crisis, does my mind think in English or in Polish?', 'Is it English or Polish I feel more comfortable with when anxious?', 'Is it Polish or English my brain goes automatically by default when anxious?' - I still keep asking myself.</p>
<p>On top of that, it all happened in Scotland, not Poland, and not having gone through similar experiences before, I wasn't aware of certain procedures and support that was available in Scotland. And since some of the procedures and regulations are non-existent in Poland, I thought, that's how it is in every country. That added an extra layer of confusion. </p>
<p>I feel this play is important because all kinds of things happen to us, good or bad, and we still need to fulfil our potential and do things that we want to achieve. I feel watching the play will give the audience hope and motivation to overcome certain difficulties no matter what has happened to them.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>Reactions</u></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Feedback from the BBC Writersroom</b></p>
<p><i>This is an excellent and original monologue spoken straight from the heart. The storytelling is rapid and urgent – it is told like the narrator's life depends on it. In a story that jumps backwards and forwards in time, between countries and languages .[...]Though the story is often bleak the language used is buzzy, sparky, poetic and darkly funny. The writing of the monologue itself becomes a redemptive act. The writer has a great eye for detail. Unusual and bizarre details are honed in on. [...] This is a bold and original voice that throws an interesting and heartbreaking light on what it means to be an immigrant and what it means to be a victim of violence.</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Peter Arnott, a leading Scottish playwright tweeted</strong></p>
<p><i>This is a really interesting piece of work ... a comic and painful exploration of the differences between getting mugged in Edinburgh and Warsaw! Written and performed by Remi ... it's a really individual take on the 'Pole in Scotland' experience  ... and dramatically innovative too.</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Feedback from rehearsed readings</strong></p>
<p><i>' ... very powerful stuff; keep working on it; looking forward to seeing next stage...'</i></p>
<p><i>'... a very funny and accomplished performance, well done...'</i></p>
<p><i>'...well done on a powerful, deeply personal and funny piece of storytelling. I look forward to seeing a full staging, which will help illuminate some of the more nuanced aspects of the piece and make clearer definitions between scene changed + time shifts ...'</i></p>
<p><i>'I liked it; fantastic acting; plot keeps you engaged and in suspense; no time to think of anything else apart from the play; excellent dramatic storytelling; worked very well as a piece of theatre'</i></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>The journey so far ...</u></h3>
<p>It was David Overend, an assistant director on a short film I was making in Glasgow in 2010, who when told about the incident in Edinburgh and my written account of it expressed an interest in reading the 14 pages. It was the first time I took the pages out of the drawer. We soon worked on it at the Arches in Glasgow. Initially, I found it very difficult to detach myself from all the events to make it a piece of theatre. It seemed to me I was reliving the whole incident again. Upon reflection, I conclude the 11 years that have passed from the incident in Edinburgh were probably the time I needed to put the play on. </p>
<p>In 2012, Creative Scotland provided funding for an initial development, ran in Glasgow with my late friend and drama school classmate, director Amanda Gaughan, dramaturg Catherine Grosvenor and actor Mark Wood. The subsequent redraft was shortlisted for 2013 Adrian Pagan Playwrighting Competition at London’s King’s Head Theatre. The benefit of being shortlisted was a rehearsed reading of that draft at the Hope Theatre, London, directed by Oscar Toeman. Having received feedback from quite many literary managers after the reading, I began redrafting and redrafting. In 2017 I submitted a new and restructured draft to BBC Writersroom Drama and I couldn't believe that it got to the final shortlist, selected out of nearly 3800 scripts.</p>
<p>In 2018, when the play was getting more momentum, my director friend Amanda Gaughan died tragically. Fortunately, a director friend from a year below at the Conservatoire, Marcus Montgomery Roche, expressed an interest in working on it and between September-December 2018, we held a few rehearsed sharings/readings in London e.g. Dragon's Cafe, Hope Theatre, King's Head Theatre, and in Scotland e.g. North Edinburgh Arts. We collaborated on these readings with Edinburgh-based Asylon Theatre and its Artistic Director, Marta Mari.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>Already supported</u></h3>
<p>We've already had amazing support from Polish weekly magazines in London e.g. 'Cooltura','Tydzień Polski', and <a href=""http://londynek.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">londynek.net</a>, the most popular website for the Poles in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1580660006/tqd9qgd0pbt2yekl2cqm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>1 condition - Why do I need your help?</u></h3>
<p>We have received funding from Arts Council England but one of the conditions of receiving the funding is raising £3600 towards the tour. Without the money, we wouldn't be able to do it. We are planning 14 performances in total (10 performances of the Polish version and 4 performances of the English version) with 4 platform productions in London in April (1,2,3,4) then Bedford, Slough, Bognor Regis, Croydon, Wandsworth,  Manchester.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The money will go towards</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>accommodation and transport</li>
<li>venue hire costs</li>
<li>set and costumes</li>
<li>printing of posters </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>By supporting INTRUDER|INTRUZ, you would be joining a very prestigious group of mentors supporting the arts, the play with its themes and me, a young artist, emerging, promising artist and helping to make his dreams come true. </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>Extra</u></h3>
<p>An additional £4400 would help present the piece in Scotland (as for me this piece belongs to Scotland), Poland e.g. in my home-town Kudowa Zdrój. We have already had an invitation to perform at United Solo Festival in New York but because of financial reasons, we needed to postpone that trip. This money would go towards</p>
<ul>
<li>transport of the team to these places and housing them</li>
<li>generating and printing publicity materials and hiring a PR company</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>These efforts are pricy but worth it!  These resources will help get the outreach it deserves.  If we use it well, the tour of England will be a fantastic launching platform to finally bring this play to wider audiences. I can't wait to share the play with audiences.</p>

So finally after 11 years of working on my autobiographical bilingual (English-Polish) one-man play titled INTRUDER|INTRUZ, my dreams of putting the play on are coming to fruition. The play tells a story of a young Polish man who comes to Scotland to make his dreams come true and become an actor but is a victim of traumatic events. 
Remi's story ... 
Since I remember I've always wanted to be an actor. I actually never remember saying it but I remember my father replying 'Yes, you're going to be an actor  .......... after they burn down all the theatres'.

Actually, I never wanted to come back to the written account of the event and I put it in a drawer. It was that evening when the first 14 pages of INTRUDER were written. 
Intruder | Intruz ... and the influences
The account of the incident in Edinburgh became the foundation for my passion project. Originally, I wrote it in English with Polish elements and there is now a Polish version with English elements titled INTRUZ. I translated the piece into Polish as I wanted to share my story with so many Poles living in England.

Why is this play important?
 mental health
anxiety
 forgiveness
  restorative justice system
 what it's like to be an immigrant
what it's like to be a victim of violence
 finally, making your dreams come true
these themes of the play came up very organically and to be quite honest life wrote them. I found it very interesting and to some extent therapeutic to work on the play especially during the initial development of it in Glasgow in 2012. Looking at your own life and being told of certain patterns of behaviour is fascinating and made me think a lot about how I behave and what I do. Taking certain emotions e.g. feeling anxious, for granted and then being told, 'No, it's not ok, to feel this way' was very liberating especially when I met people who went through similar incidents and experienced similar emotions and feelings.

I feel this play is important because all kinds of things happen to us, good or bad, and we still need to fulfil our potential and do things that we want to achieve. I feel watching the play will give the audience hope and motivation to overcome certain difficulties no matter what has happened to them.

This is a really interesting piece of work ... a comic and painful exploration of the differences between getting mugged in Edinburgh and Warsaw! Written and performed by Remi ... it's a really individual take on the 'Pole in Scotland' experience  ... and dramatically innovative too.

Past productions and partnerships include Théâtre Sans Frontières (two-year strategic tour of David Almond’s Heaven Eyes); Creation Theatre (Henry V, Lion, Witch, and the Wardrobe); Plutôt la Vie (By the Seat of Your Pants (national tour / IPAY – Philadelphia International Children’s Festival/ Imaginate Festival); Room 2 Manoeuvre (Watch iT! – Made in Scotland Programme / Almeida Theatre, Without a Hitch – Finland / Luxembourg / UK tour), Nutshell Theatre (Allotment – Fringe First winner – UK tour, 106 performances / Thread – Fringe First winner – UK tour, co-production with Assembly / ONFife). 
Already supported
We've already had amazing support from Polish weekly magazines in London e.g. 'Cooltura','Tydzień Polski', and londynek.net, the most popular website for the Poles in the United Kingdom.

 
1 condition - Why do I need your help?
We have received funding from Arts Council England but one of the conditions of receiving the funding is raising £3600 towards the tour. Without the money, we wouldn't be able to do it. We are planning 14 performances in total (10 performances of the Polish version and 4 performances of the English version) with 4 platform productions in London in April (1,2,3,4) then Bedford, Slough, Bognor Regis, Croydon, Wandsworth,  Manchester.
The money will go towards

accommodation and transport
venue hire costs
set and costumes
printing of posters 

 
By supporting INTRUDER|INTRUZ, you would be joining a very prestigious group of mentors supporting the arts, the play with its themes and me, a young artist, emerging, promising artist and helping to make his dreams come true. 
Extra
An additional £4400 would help present the piece in Scotland (as for me this piece belongs to Scotland), Poland e.g. in my home-town Kudowa Zdrój. We have already had an invitation to perform at United Solo Festival in New York but because of financial reasons, we needed to postpone that trip. This money would go towards

transport of the team to these places and housing them
generating and printing publicity materials and hiring a PR company

 
These efforts are pricy but worth it!  These resources will help get the outreach it deserves.  If we use it well, the tour of England will be a fantastic launching platform to finally bring this play to wider audiences. I can't wait to share the play with audiences.

<p><span>Formed in 2008 by Cheek by Jowl's associate director Owen Horsley, Eyestrings Theatre Company is committed to producing courageous and bold interpretations of the classics. We aim to convey an experience provisional and lived, in which our actors inhabit a precarious present, never simply expressing an emotion but always reacting to the audience and trying to control the rapid propulsion of the narrative. </span></p>
<p><span>We are devoted to our audience by creating work that is always informed by the specific contours of each space we perform in, a space that our audience inhabit also. We believe the stories we perform still play a crucial part in understanding our society and we strive to create images that encourage the audience to re-open their eyes. </span></p>
<p>Eyestrings' goal is to begin touring, sharing the classics presented with the company’s unique stamp. The work which we have chosen to begin our touring life, is The Duchess of Malfi, which originated from a workshop and showing in 2011 at the Soho Theatre, and has now been confirmed for a run at the Oxford Playhouse Burton Taylor Studio and at The White Bear in London in September.</p>
<p><span>The production, which had an incredible response when we presented it to an audience at the Soho Theatre, exposes the play in a way that many of our audience have never seen before. The brutality of the play is matched by the starkness of the space – six chairs occupied by smiling figures confront the audience as they enter the space. A gramophone record bounces along as it plays an uplifting ditty in the corner – the voices from the dead providing the up beat soundtrack to this tragic tale. </span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span><em>""The clarity of this version of The Duchess of Malfi made this compelling and dark tale all the more powerful and hard hitting. Images from this stylish and highly charged piece of theatre still live, hauntingly, in my mind""</em> - </span>Griselda Yorke, Executive Producer, Punchdrunk</p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>We are looking to raise £1,500 to go towards funding a week of touring at the Oxford Playhouse and three weeks at The White Bear in London.

<h3>We Are Going To Europe!</h3>
<p>ManyTracks produced the premiere of Shooter during March 2018 in NYC. Shooter has now become committed for a European cultural tour spanning three countries over 6 performances in 12 days during January 2019.</p>
<p>Shooter is a play which explores a uniquely American problem; mass shootings, almost all committed by men. With each violent shooter-massacre carried out by a man, Shooter questions the relationship of not just our gun culture to the male identity but also of how men fail each other when they need each other most.</p>

<p>Since 2004, Coast City Ballet [CCB] has built the foundation and has become a leading Southern California area dance company. </p>

<p><strong>Our history:</strong></p>
<p>In 2004, with a modest legacy left by Mr. Joseph D’Autilia, who wanted to see his daughter’s dream of training dancers in a professional, caring, and safe environment come true.  Alicia and Clara D’Autilia purchased Pacific Dance Center in Huntington Beach. </p>
<p>Clara has been dancing since she was three-years-old, and teaching for over 20 years. She studied dance locally, in New York and in Argentina. </p>
<p>The mother-daughter duo founded Coast City Ballet and received non-profit status in April 2005. They immediately set out to promote the art of dance, to make ballet accessible to all, offer a bridge between training and performing, and to provide dancers and choreographers of all ages with the opportunities to dance, perform, and create.</p>
<p>Since March 2005, CCB has won numerous national and international dance awards and participated in community outreach programs. They performed in various Southland venues, and presented dozens of CCB members' choreographed works. </p>
<p>This year marks CCB’s 10th Anniversary full-length production of The Nutcracker Ballet. Based on the original choreography by Marius Petipa and Leon Ivanov, CCB's The Nutcracker (choreographed and directed by Clara D'Autilia) features Company resident dancers, invited guest performers and a cast ranging from three-year-old pre-dance students to professional adults.  The Company has also proudly featured three generations of dancers in the same production. </p>

<p>My name is Samantha Goodman and I am the Artistic Director and Choreographer of <strong>DEPTH OF SURFACE, </strong>my new interdisciplinary dance work that will premier at the opening week of REDCAT's New Original Works Festival, July 25, 26 &amp; 27!!! </p>
<p><a href=""http://www.redcat.org/event/now-fest-2013-wk-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.redcat.org/event/now-fest-2013-wk-1</a></p>

<p><strong><em>DEPTH OF SURFACE</em></strong> explores the act of remembering as a continuous state of re-creating and re-imagining past lived experiences. Featuring an original score by jazz pianist Reggy Woods and cellist Isaac Takeuchi, costumes by Desiree Klein, and large scale video projections, five dancers explore the fluid boundary between the present moment and remembered past as they are submerged in rich visual and sonic landscapes.</p>
<p>My interests thrive in the sensory and emotional responses sparked by memory, and the ways in which they texture the body and layer the human experience. I am developing a unique movement style, which investigates the intersections of post-modern release based body mechanics with performance qualities and uses of the spine explored in traditional Afro-Brazilian dance. Over the past decade, I have been dedicated to movement research of both contemporary and traditional Afro-Brazilian dance abroad in Salvador, Brazil. I am currently pursuing my masters degree in Dance at UCLA’s World Arts and Cultures Department.</p>
<p>As an independent choreographer experimenting with the mediums of dance and video, it is quite an honor to be presenting my work at the New Original Works Festival alongside a handful of very talented multi disciplinary artists. While I am extremely grateful for the generous contributions from the REDCAT Theater to partially produce <strong><em>DEPTH OF SURFACE</em></strong>, I am still in need of additional funds to complete this project to its full potential in supporting our large cast of 9 artists, and to cover the costs of costume production, rehearsal space and transportation.</p>
<p>Our extremely talented cast is made up of: </p>
<p><em>DANCERS</em>: Sasha Rivero, Rande Dorn, Misha Vickroy, Michelle-Marie Gilkeson, Bridget Murano</p>
<p><em>COMPOSERS/MUSICIANS</em>: Reggy Woods, Isaac Takeuchi</p>
<p><em>COSTUME DESIGNER</em>: Desiree Klein</p>
<p><em>ARTISTIC DIRECTOR/CHOREOGRAPHER</em>: Samantha Blake Goodman</p>
<p>Over the past month and a half, the cast has put in over 75 hours of their time and artistry to this project. ALL donations will go towards compensating the artists for their work and dedicated time in bringing <strong><em>DEPTH OF SURFACE </em></strong>to life, as well as production costs for the costumes, rehearsal space fees and transportation!!</p>
<p>We are extremely grateful for donations in any amount and thank you for supporting the independent artists that make up our cast. We hope to see you all at the show July 25, 26 and 27 and can not wait to share this this special work with you!!!!! </p>
