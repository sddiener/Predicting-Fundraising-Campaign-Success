<p>This past summer, four student fellows from around the world (Hallie Sekoff, Sandrayati
Fay, Katie Grindeland and Lucia D’Onofrio) convened at the Global Arts Corps
office in New York City. We came together with a shared belief that art can
unearth buried stories and shift indelible barriers. </p>
<p>We
are launching this Indiegogo to support Global Arts Corps' current project, a
devised production between performers at the Phare Ponleu Selpak
school in Battambang, Cambodia and a team of international artists from Global Arts Corps. We believe
that Global Arts Corps' work is a testament to the power of theatre as a
transformative medium for education and social change. </p>
<p>The
goals of this project are:</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">To raise $ 40,000 to cover </b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">our <u>artistic team’s fees</u>, f<u>ilming of our workshops</u>, <u>local

</div>
</div><div>
<div>
<p>In
2013, under the artistic direction of Michael Lessac, a small group of
international artists traveled to Cambodia to hold a five-week workshop with
the performers at the Phare Ponleu Selpak art school in Battambang, Cambodia.
Lessac and these artists of Global Arts Corps were invited by a collective of Cambodian
artists, themselves survivors of the Khmer Rouge period in Cambodia, who
had started Phare Ponleu Selpak (Brightness of the Arts). </p>
<p>The
aim of the initial workshop was to determine whether the students at Phare
would be interested in working with GAC to develop a touring circus/theatre
production that would explore life in Cambodia after the catastrophic Khmer
Rouge regime. Following an enthusiastic response to the first workshop, GAC
returned to Cambodia in early 2014 to assemble a preliminary cast and the
elements of a script for the final production. The time has come to
return so as to further solidify the production and begin initial planning for
a subsequent global tour. </p>
<p>The
results of GAC’s initial work in Battambang can best be experienced through our
25-minute video: </p>

<h3>Why Indiegogo?</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>1.
In all of our projects, it’s often easy to find funding for a production’s
premiere and tour. Individuals and organizations are interested in seeing a
project’s impact within their own communities. Before that can happen, however,
much time, energy, and research must be put into the production’s development.
It is this work--that takes place “behind the scenes” and is largely invisible
to our audiences--that ensures the quality and authenticity of our final
productions. An extended development period is necessary for Global Arts Corps
(to learn about the people with whom we’re working) and our performers (to have
time and space to reflect on the stories they need to share). </p>
<p>2.
Crowdfunding offers a simple way for our friends and supporters to play a
crucial role in the development of this new production. It allows many people
to give what they can afford. Donations of all sizes can have an extraordinary
impact ($15 will cover lunches for 3 hard-working performers in Battambang!).</p>
<p>3. This work is driven by a passionate belief that
the Cambodian experience tells a story about all of us. Their story is a
microcosm of feelings and experiences that needs to be shared with people
coming out of conflict around the world. We hope that this Indiegogo campaign
will help us spread their story and engage viewers in a conversation about the
role of the arts in fostering understanding and shifts in perception in
countries across the globe.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This incredible Ballroom Dance performance featuring the best competitors in the country, is going to launch a not for profit dance program for girls ages 12-17 who have suffered sexual or physical abuse. Our mission is to empower our students helping them become confident SURVIVORS so they never feel like, or be seen as a victim again.</p>
<p>I lived through a series of terrible events my first year of high school, and struggled for years afterward. I was blessed when I stumbled across ballroom dance and immediately fell in love with it. Competitive dancing gave me the confidence I needed to reclaim my life. I know there is a reason I survived what I went through and I believe it's to help others heal too.</p>
<p>My dream is to have our own studio with an open door policy for any child to be able to learn and practice dance and music. In addition to the start up funds we'll receive from ticket sales, this performance will inspire people to learn to dance and draw the attention we need to make a strong start.  </p>
<p>Please see photo gallery for the names and titles of the dancers, and be sure to check them out on Youtube!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is $45,000. Broken down its $18,500 to pay the dancers and cover their expenses; $10,500 to rent an event space large enough, and the rest is for lights, music, photography and video production, program and ticket design/printing, rental and setup of the dance floor, mandatory event insurance and approved workers etc. All of that actually comes to $41,920 but we're taking into account the fees associated with crowd funding and leaving a little room for unexpected costs by rounding up to an even $45,000. </p>
<p>Every child should have something that motivates them, keeps them active, something to distract them from day to day problems, that allows them to express themselves. This is even more true for those who have been abused. Knowing you're helping to provide this opportunity is bound to give warm and fuzzy feelings :) and the perks we're offering are pretty awesome too. These dancers are breathtaking, just imagine seeing all of them in a high quality video with the whole dance floor to themselves.You also have the option of seeing them in person or better yet having a picture taken with them after watching the show! This is a rare opportunity as they are usually either teaching or competing in different places around the U.S. and the World.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Why have a performance instead of using all this money to teach?<br/><br/>In order to really make a difference we have to be here long term. My biggest fear is that we would have initial support and be able to give girls the opportunity to do something they love, only to have it fall apart due to a lack of funding. It would be devastating. Anyone who has been a part of a non profit knows how difficult it can be to receive grants, loans, donations etc. We plan on minimizing these obstacles by becoming a successful business, to allow us to support this program ourselves.<br/><br/> I've had the privilege of watching these amazing dancers in person and I've felt the collective energy they create in an audience. It would make just about anyone want to take dance lessons. Every lesson a paying adult buys from our studio also provides free lessons for the students in our program. Every pair of shoes we sell, every ball gown we rent, everything gives us the income that ensures the success of this project and these children. Think of this performance as one giant ad campaign/launch party to announce who we are, what we're doing, and most importantly why it needs to be done. </p>
<p>Of course I hope we meet our goal but if we don't, all the money we do receive will go toward teaching a small number of girls less often.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Dancing is not only a breathtaking art, it can also be a tool. ""To touch, to move, to inspire. This is the true gift of dance"" -Aubrey Lynch. Through art people can express and understand things that can't be explained otherwise.<br/><br/> Art serves no other purpose than to make us feel something, to help people connect. It would make sense then, that a group of people whose most common ailment is feeling numb or out of touch with themselves, would need the therapeutic benefits of art the most.<br/><br/> In Washington State, 1 in 4 girls under the age of 18 has been a victim of some form of sexual abuse.

This incredible Ballroom Dance performance featuring the best competitors in the country, is going to launch a not for profit dance program for girls ages 12-17 who have suffered sexual or physical abuse. Our mission is to empower our students helping them become confident SURVIVORS so they never feel like, or be seen as a victim again.
I lived through a series of terrible events my first year of high school, and struggled for years afterward. I was blessed when I stumbled across ballroom dance and immediately fell in love with it. Competitive dancing gave me the confidence I needed to reclaim my life. I know there is a reason I survived what I went through and I believe it's to help others heal too.
My dream is to have our own studio with an open door policy for any child to be able to learn and practice dance and music. In addition to the start up funds we'll receive from ticket sales, this performance will inspire people to learn to dance and draw the attention we need to make a strong start.  
Please see photo gallery for the names and titles of the dancers, and be sure to check them out on Youtube!


What We Need & What You Get
Our goal is $45,000. Broken down its $18,500 to pay the dancers and cover their expenses; $10,500 to rent an event space large enough, and the rest is for lights, music, photography and video production, program and ticket design/printing, rental and setup of the dance floor, mandatory event insurance and approved workers etc. All of that actually comes to $41,920 but we're taking into account the fees associated with crowd funding and leaving a little room for unexpected costs by rounding up to an even $45,000. 
Every child should have something that motivates them, keeps them active, something to distract them from day to day problems, that allows them to express themselves. This is even more true for those who have been abused. Knowing you're helping to provide this opportunity is bound to give warm and fuzzy feelings :) and the perks we're offering are pretty awesome too. These dancers are breathtaking, just imagine seeing all of them in a high quality video with the whole dance floor to themselves.You also have the option of seeing them in person or better yet having a picture taken with them after watching the show! This is a rare opportunity as they are usually either teaching or competing in different places around the U.S. and the World.
 
Why have a performance instead of using all this money to teach?In order to really make a difference we have to be here long term. My biggest fear is that we would have initial support and be able to give girls the opportunity to do something they love, only to have it fall apart due to a lack of funding. It would be devastating. Anyone who has been a part of a non profit knows how difficult it can be to receive grants, loans, donations etc. We plan on minimizing these obstacles by becoming a successful business, to allow us to support this program ourselves. I've had the privilege of watching these amazing dancers in person and I've felt the collective energy they create in an audience. It would make just about anyone want to take dance lessons. Every lesson a paying adult buys from our studio also provides free lessons for the students in our program. Every pair of shoes we sell, every ball gown we rent, everything gives us the income that ensures the success of this project and these children. Think of this performance as one giant ad campaign/launch party to announce who we are, what we're doing, and most importantly why it needs to be done. 
Of course I hope we meet our goal but if we don't, all the money we do receive will go toward teaching a small number of girls less often.

The Impact
Dancing is not only a breathtaking art, it can also be a tool. ""To touch, to move, to inspire. This is the true gift of dance"" -Aubrey Lynch. Through art people can express and understand things that can't be explained otherwise. Art serves no other purpose than to make us feel something, to help people connect. It would make sense then, that a group of people whose most common ailment is feeling numb or out of touch with themselves, would need the therapeutic benefits of art the most. In Washington State, 1 in 4 girls under the age of 18 has been a victim of some form of sexual abuse. Diamond Ballroom Dance Center's goal is to use the powerful life lessons dance has to offer to redirect the lives of girls who are ""at risk"". All the issues that can arise after a traumatic experience can easily lead to further problems. Depression, further abuse, alcoholism and drug addiction are all pitfalls that are extremely difficult to avoid or overcome without a solid support system. Diamond Ballroom will provide survivors with a support system of teachers, mentors and peers that reward them for their effort in school and in therapy with ballroom dance lessons.Ludovic Morlot, Music Director for the Seattle Symphony said ""I believe in the intrinsic power of the arts to enrich our lives, and that the influence of the arts can be substantial and transformative, especially for young people."" Working in cooperation with parents or guardians and therapists, we will help girls focus on their strengths to build confidence on and off the dance floor. The mental control that develops to quiet nervousness before a competition translates into everyday life to help those with anxiety.

The positive effects of dance are countless but possibly one of the most important lessons students learn is how to build healthy relationships.

<h3>Hello...</h3>
<p>If you’re reading this you most likely know me and even seen me at work on stage. If not, allow me to introduce myself…I’m Jose and yes I’m an actor / writer.</p>
<p>I am a LaGuradia Performing Arts H.S. alumni currently pursuing a degree in Theatre at Lehman College. Theatre is what I love and being an artist is who I am. After years of pursuing a career in Theatre I have decided to take matters into my own hands.</p>
<h3>The Goal</h3>
This summer I intend to put up my very own play titled “Out of My Mind.” It’s an original piece which I wrote about the extreme measures some of us take to pursue our dreams. Here’s a quick synopsis…</div>
<div>
<p><em>Joe is an aspiring playwright who moved to New York with dreams of making it big on Broadway. His play is most likely to get the Tony but there’s only one problem; he hasn’t written it yet. Consumed with working side jobs to survive, Joe has no time to write. Wishing there was a way to eliminate the bills and create more time, Joe desperately comes up with a “brilliant” idea. He decides to become a patient at a local mental institution to avoid paying bills and create all the time he needs to write his play. Perfect, right? All he has to do is put on the performance of a lifetime to get instituted. Unfortunately things don’t turn out as planned as it was easier getting in then getting out. There’s a fine line between Broadway and the looney house?     </em> </p>
<p>The play is very much art imitating life as it is inspired by the realities of any artist pursuing the dream and having to deal with “side jobs” just to survive. Hopefully no one has ended up in a mental institution (although it wouldn’t be a stretch in this business).</p>
<h3>Your Donations</h3>
Your donations will go into mounting up this production. You will make it possible for us to fund the following; Theatre space, rehearsal studio, cast promotional pics, industry invitation packages, hiring tech crew, ushers, dvd promos and so much more. I am planning to raise $2,000 to cover all of this while you can enjoy the “Perks” in donating it.</div>
<div>
<p>PLEASE SEE PERK SECTION TO SEE WHAT YOU GET.</p>
<h3>Show Dates</h3>
<p>The show will go up in June of this year at a local theatre in Manhattan. Depending on your contributions it will determine which space we get and what dates are available. Please email us at – <a href=""mailto:ACrazyPlay@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ACrazyPlay@gmail.com</a> to receive all the shows information and website availability.</p>
<p>Note: The play is also pending on a playwriting festival and is currently under the consideration process.</p>

<p><strong>Soup Can Theatre</strong> is a vibrant Toronto-based theatre company dedicated to the reinterpretation of classic theatre for a twenty-first century audience. Our aim is to use existing works as a means to explore and comment on contemporary issues and societal challenges, and in so doing, to offer our audiences a theatrical experience that is both entertaining and enriching.</p>
<p>Since our inception in 2008, we have built a <strong>highly successful track record</strong>; our productions have played to <strong>sold out houses</strong>, garnered <strong>glowing accolades</strong> from the press and audiences alike (including <strong>five star reviews</strong> of our two most recent shows), and earned us a reputation as a company on the rise. Our creative team is graced with some of Toronto’s most notable young artists; our past and present collaborators have also performed in or worked on shows produced by or in association with <strong>Mirvish Productions</strong>, <strong>The Canadian Opera Company</strong>, <strong>The Shaw Festival</strong>, <strong>The Luminato Festival, The Banff Centre, </strong>and<strong> The Blyth Festival</strong>. Furthermore, our work has been singled out for recognition by Toronto’s theatre community with three <strong>‘My Theatre’ Award</strong> nominations and one win, one<strong> ‘Broadway World’ Award</strong> nomination, and participation in the coveted <strong>‘Best of Fringe’</strong> program.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>About Our Production of <em>Antigone</em></strong></h3>
<p>We are currently in rehearsals for our next exciting project: a visceral and physical adaptation of the legendary Greek tragedy <strong><em>Antigone</em></strong> that will draw present-day inspiration from the searing images of the 2010 G20 Summit protests and the worldwide ‘Occupy’<strong> </strong>movement.</p>
<p>The story of <em>Antigone</em>, which centres on a defiant young woman’s quest to honour her two brothers who die fighting on opposite sides of a senseless war, is symbolic of today’s politically divisive climate and offers a compelling artistic opportunity to examine themes of social justice and humanity’s present and historic penchant for bilateral conflict.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Why We Need Your Help</strong></h3>
<p><strong></strong>Theatre is not a profitable art form. This is especially true for the Fringe Festival where each company only has seven performances, and the average income per ticket sold is less than 9 dollars. Expenses, like rehearsal space at 15-20 dollars an hour, add up all too quickly, and <strong>breaking even is never guaranteed</strong>.</p>
<p>Next to our artistic objectives, one of our main goals is to <strong>support our artists and collaborators</strong>. Your donations will not only help us cover production costs, but more importantly, they will also help us provide our cast and crew with honoraria as compensation for their <strong>talent, dedication, and hard work</strong>. The life of an independent artist is not an easy one, but <strong>your generosity can help change that reality.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<h3><strong>What’s in it for You?</strong></h3>
<p><strong></strong>Your generosity won’t go unrewarded! Check out our <strong>unique perks</strong> to the right. You could get free tickets to the show, personalized poetry, signed posters, a special brunch date with our friendly director and one of our stars, exposure for your company or organization (if applicable), and more!</p>
<p>(Please note that Indiegogo uses US funds which means you may see a small discrepency between the figures listed to the right and the actual transaction amount depending on the currency conversion.) </p>
<h3><strong>How Else Can You Help?</strong></h3>

Envía a las bailarinas de ""MARIACHI"" a Bruselas
La compañía TEMPESDANZA ha sido invitada para realizar una residencia artística en el DANSCENTRUMJETTE en Bruselas durante el mes de agosto de este año. 

Esta residencia es una oportunidad única para proyectar nuestro trabajo en Europa.
Queremos llevar nuestro estilo de Danza Contemporánea con sabor mexicano a Europa.
DANSCENTRUMJETTE en Bruselas es un reconocido espacio de investigación coreográfica donde han trabajado coreógrafos como David Zambrano, Julyen Hamilton y David Hernandez.



La Compañía TEMPESDANZA
se estableció en Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico en el 2006. Desde entonces hemos producido al menos un programa nuevo por año, presentándolo en diversos foros y espacios públicos. Nuestra labor ha sido dedicada a:

Creación, investigación y exploración en Danza Contemporánea,  Improvisación, Composición Instantánea y Contact Improvisación.
Promoción de  Danza Contemporánea y Danza Teatro
Formación en danza y movimeinto para personas de todas las condiciones socioeconómicas.
Educación de nuevos púbicos para la Danza Contemporánea.

 
PREMIOS



2009 CACHO 'E TABLA ""Mejor performance""
2010 CACHO 'E TABLA ""Mejor obra de danza""

Necesitamos US$5,850

Ninguno de nosotros recibirá salario alguno durante la residencia.
El presupuesto total de nuestro proyecto es de US$11,850
Ya contamos con US$6,000
Desafortunadamente, el mes de agosto es temporada alta para los vuelos a Europa y cada boleto (MEX-BRU-MEX) tiene un costo mínimo de US$1,350.

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><span>I grew up in Beaverton, OR and I have been dancing for seven years now, and I'm absolutely thrilled to have found my passion.  My dream is to dance in a professional modern based dance company. Amongst that list is Hubbard Street Dance Chicago.  Now a Freshman dance major at Cornish College of the Arts, I study Ballet and Modern.  I have found my love for modern dance over the past few years, and it has taken the form of being my religion.  As a dancer and artist it is incredibly important to continue training throughout the year, and while school is out for the summer it is the perfect time to enter the world of dance and study abroad.  To my surprise, after auditioning for the Hubbard Street Summer Intensive, I was accepted. This is an incredible opportunity and I really want to make it happen. </span>I want to be one of these dancers who is able to further examine themselves through the art of dance. Please help me live this dream of dancing with other dancers who also want to do the same; continue to find the artist within.  The life of an artist is very expensive, already paying for college I am unable to attend Hubbard Street this summer without the support of my community. Thank you for your time and ANY donation really does help!  </p>

<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What I Need</span></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I aspire to attend the Hubbard Street 4 week Summer Intensive in Chicago, IL.  I have been graciously given a few scholarships that I am able to apply <strong>only</strong> to my tuition.  That being said, I need help raising the funds for the housing that is connected to the program itself.  All funds raised will go towards paying for housing.   </p>

<p>Tuition: <strong>$1,900</strong></p>
<p>Housing: <strong>$2,200</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>As I continue to study dance, my hope is to dance professionally very soon.  Training with Hubbard Street is a phenomenal opportunity to learn with one of the top Modern companies in the world.  It is rare that one comes across a passion so big that it ignites every aspect of their life, for me dance has done this. Recently, I have begun to become mindful of the connection between myself and dance.  The reason I dance, and what it does for my body and soul are questions that I have been exploring recently.  I find that when I am creating dance and movement it helps me further understand what it is that I love about dance.  It is the simple action of dancing through space. Dance is my voice.  It is the way I am able to convey stories, information, or the feeling that simply cannot be put into words.  It allows me to show that dancing is not purely a hobby, but rather a necessity in my life.  Please help me continue on this beautiful journey that I have already set the path for.  THANK YOU!</p>

<h3>Kelsey's Story</h3>
<p>Remember your college days with all of the studying, test, and hard work? I'm sure you remember the tight budget you lived on. Kelsey has studied dance since she was a little girl and is finally graduating from the prestigious University of the Arts in Philadelphia with Bachelor of Fine Arts in Dance.  She has an awesome opportunity to audition with a prestigious dance company in Italy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Weller Thomas and I recently met Kelsey when she volunteered to help a bunch of hapless volunteers learn basic steps for a non-profit fundraiser. Yes, we were a motley crew. But, the volunteer dance students turned us in to respectably participants and I even won second place in the competition! Amazing. </li>
<li>Week after week Kelsey showed up to help us learn to dance. It was then we learned she was a student who was also carrying a full load of senior-year studies! And what's more, she has volunteered her talents to the non-profit organization for the past three years.</li>
<li><p>Together we can take the burden of, ""How will I get to Italy to audition?"" off of her mind. Won't you join me in helping raise the airfare to send her?</p></li>
<li>Kelsey is trained in West African, Ballet, Pointe, Ballet Partnering, Latin, Jazz, Horton, Contemporary, Improvisation, Modern Partnering, Alto/Tenor Vocals. </li>

Remember your college days with all of the studying, test, and hard work? I'm sure you remember the tight budget you lived on. Kelsey has studied dance since she was a little girl and is finally graduating from the prestigious University of the Arts in Philadelphia with Bachelor of Fine Arts in Dance.  She has an awesome opportunity to audition with a prestigious dance company in Italy.

Weller Thomas and I recently met Kelsey when she volunteered to help a bunch of hapless volunteers learn basic steps for a non-profit fundraiser. Yes, we were a motley crew. But, the volunteer dance students turned us in to respectably participants and I even won second place in the competition! Amazing. 
Week after week Kelsey showed up to help us learn to dance. It was then we learned she was a student who was also carrying a full load of senior-year studies! And what's more, she has volunteered her talents to the non-profit organization for the past three years.
Together we can take the burden of, ""How will I get to Italy to audition?"" off of her mind. Won't you join me in helping raise the airfare to send her?
Kelsey is trained in West African, Ballet, Pointe, Ballet Partnering, Latin, Jazz, Horton, Contemporary, Improvisation, Modern Partnering, Alto/Tenor Vocals. 

If you can make a contribution, (no amount is too small) together we can make it happen.
Help raise $1500 for Kelsey's airfare and  expenses for three days.

Please donate, $10, $25, $100 or whatever you feel inclined to give.
Kelsey will write a personal thank you note for each and every contribution.
The goal is $1500, but if we fall short (and I hope we don't) we will give Kelsey whatever we raise.

<p>Hi Everyone! Thank you for taking out time to look at our campaign page. I am Director and writer Keith D. Bracker tag teaming with Actress and Producer Jan Mizushima. </p>
<p>We are excited to launch this campaign for our stage play <i>'Feathered Thorns' </i>which is to be an exciting experience on stage! </p>
<p>Keith: <i>'Feathered Thorns'</i> is a story that I wrote in 2008.  I began to shoot it as a feature length movie but after finances fell through and a cast member caught walking pneumonia we had to put production on hold. Recently, the story was picked back up and I decided to adapt it into a stage play to challenge myself to capture the life of artists the best way me and the team know how on the stage. This will be my directorial debut for a stage play, in which I'm very excited about! However, I've been writing and directing well over a decade. I'm passionate about telling unique, creative, powerful, challenging stories that explore lives of complex characters and themes. </p>
<p>Jan: I am an founder/artistic director of Plug-In Theater Company ; a producing organization found in 2004 with a mission to provide plays related to political and social issues.  <i>'Feathered Thorns'</i> is a beautifully written play about two artist in different stages of life finding their voice through art. I am so excited and passionate to be apart of telling this story.</p>
<p><i>'Feathered Thorns'</i> covers the relationship between a speech impaired twenty year old Qiao, living with her overprotective mother, Xiu, who wants her daughter to pick a more stable profession than being a painter. However, Qiao is a skillful artist but she is still looking for her 'voice' in her art. So Xiu, sets up a deal with Nhung, a well established popular female painter, whom Qiao admires greatly, to where Qiao will live with Nhung for a couple of weeks to learn from her. Qiao finds out Nhung is not what she expected but both women end up effecting each other in unexpected ways.  </p>
<p><i>'Feathered Thorns' </i>is a coming-to-age tale, that delves into passion, acceptance, self importance, faith, friendship and the relationship between mother and daughter.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're looking to raise $20, 000 to cover cast and crew pay, production design, props, catering and theater space. We have some cool rewards we're giving out to contributors!  One of the rewards is that you get a chance to take a picture with the incredible cast and there's a chance to receive a email directly from me, the director, or from one of the cast members thanking you for your pledge! </p>
<p>Be apart of this journey today!</p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><i>'Feathered Thorns'</i> expresses how important art can be in someones life. The arts is  an inspiration to millions, it's an outlet for those who feel like 'outsiders', the 'neglect' and those who just find it easier to use art to communicate more effectively to others. </p>
<p>Keith: This is my stage debut as a stage director and playwright. I'm very excited to share what I believe to be a unique and fun story that will inspire those who want to take that leap wholeheartedly to pursue their passion but are afraid; and the importance of self worth. A lot of my stories deal with people who struggle to become a successful artist or trying to remain successful while facing some type of opposition. And the story deals with the complexity of a mother and daughter relationship, a theme that I've explored in the past in my writing. </p>
<p>Jan: This story is about love of art, relationships, identity, finding your path and much more. It is a beautiful story between the two artist and the mothers love. </p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The cast and crew will be putting in a lot of hours to bring <i>'Feathered Thorns'</i> to life on stage in a spectacular way-so we want to show our appreciation with compensation and feeding them.

Renting a theater for several days can be costly as well but with these funds from contributors like you we know we can overcome that so we can pick a comfortable, clean, well organized theater to welcome the cast and crew, so they can give their best performance each night and of course for the audience to feel comfortable in. </p>

""<span>im·mu·ni·ty""</span> shows us people wrestling with their own humanity
in ways never before seen:<br/>A
Nazi experiencing guilt, struggling with childhood lessons vs SS propaganda. 

<p>A
Kapo turning against her own people to survive in the camps.<br/> A Jewish heroine willing to sacrifice her
life to save her husband.</p><p>“im·mu·ni·ty"" takes us inside the camps and
the struggle in the minds of the prisoners, workers and oppressors who were once kind men —party
loyalty vs morals, faith vs fear. See and hear the stories that ""Schindler's List"", ""Judgement at Nuremberg"", and ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" left out.<br/></p>
<p>It is with great
pleasure that we present the first premiere of ""
im·mu·ni·ty""as a full-length play, presented by The Manhattan
Repertory Theatre’s Play Development program.</p>
<p>The one-act
production of"" im·mu·ni·ty"" won 1<sup>st </sup>place
at NYC's 2014 Venus Theater Festival. This gripping tale has been expanded to a full-length play, and
your support can help bring it to the world!</p><p><b>
<b><u>The Story:</u></b>
</b></p>
<p>Auschwitz,
1942. Torn from her family, Gita Weitz stands
locked in a dark interrogation room with nothing
to hold on to but her faith. She is suddenly confronted by an SS officer
whose voice is familiar. Doctor Schuller, once known to Gita as Franz  was her
most prized pupil during her days as a Berlin schoolteacher.  Gita’s
relief at this recognition is short lived, however. </p>
<p>Schuller,
raised amongst the Jews and taught to regard them as equals, has since been
re-educated to believe Jews are the enemy. Believing himself misled by the
teacher he trusted and had been smitten with since childhood, he now sees the
virtues of tolerance, humanity and compassion she instilled in him as
detrimental weaknesses. </p>
<p>Schuller
designs a plan to make himself immune to his humanity by physically,
psychologically and emotionally torturing Gita each day until he is no longer
affected by her pain. </p>
Can a flicker of humanity overcome evil or hope to survive in Auschwitz? <br/><p><i></i></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1140236/files/20150109110713-Screen_Shot_2015-01-09_at_2.06.46_PM.png?1420830433"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><i>A scene from the award-winning 50-minute play, “im·mu·ni·ty” </i><br/></p><p><i>

</p><p><b>Our Goal</b> <br/></p><p>Our first priority i<span>s to present the story in as
historically accurate and emotionally authentic way possible. We will record a
professional video and pass it along to JCC’s, Educational Programs,
professional theaters and film producers around the world in order to reach as
large an audience as possible. Of course, the more money we raise, the greater
the likelihood of a successful campaign...and we can't do it without your
help!</span></p><p><span><b><u>How you
can help!<br/><br/></u></b></span></p><p><b>Phase One</b> is achieving our biggest initial goal --creating
a compelling, powerful and entertaining evening of theater, leaving audiences
awe-struck. When larger theater companies develop work, the process can take
months. We only have weeks to put up a show that producers
want to give money to and theaters want to adopt — and we know that making it
great will be a monumental task. In order for this to occur, a few certain
things are necessary for a complete and satisfying evening and campaign: </p>
<p>Programs</p>
<p>Sets
and Props</p>
<p>Costumes</p>
<p>Reserved
Tickets for Potential Investors</p>
<p>Posters,
Programs and Signage</p>
<p>Rehearsal
space</p>
<p>Travel
expenses for actors</p>
<p>Lighting
and sound </p>
<p>Marketing
and Promoting</p>
<p>Press
packages</p>
<p>Our
show dates are February, 4th and 7th, with more dates being added. Tickets are
$20 at the door. To reserve tickets, email MRTRESERVE@gmail.com with your
preferred date and number of tickets. </p>
<p>Once
the run at Manhattan Repertory Theater is complete, we move to… </p>
<p><b>Phase Two</b> is creating an “im·mu·ni·ty”
promotional theatrical trailer to submit to national theaters, festivals, producers and potential investors.</p>
<p>At the same time we will be promoting “im·mu·ni·ty” locally
with the goal of touring of educational facilities, JCC’s and more!</p><p></p><p><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1140241/files/20150109110940-Screen_Shot_2015-01-09_at_2.09.02_PM.png?1420830580"" src="""" style=""""/>

<p></p></div>","“ im·mu·ni·ty""
 is a new intense psychological
thriller set in 1942 Auschwitz, right in the middle of the second World War. Here’s your chance to be a part of this extraordinary theatrical experience!What makes “ im·mu·ni·ty"" so extraordinary? 
""im·mu·ni·ty"" shows us people wrestling with their own humanity
in ways never before seen:A
Nazi experiencing guilt, struggling with childhood lessons vs SS propaganda. 

A
Kapo turning against her own people to survive in the camps. A Jewish heroine willing to sacrifice her
life to save her husband.“im·mu·ni·ty"" takes us inside the camps and
the struggle in the minds of the prisoners, workers and oppressors who were once kind men —party
loyalty vs morals, faith vs fear. See and hear the stories that ""Schindler's List"", ""Judgement at Nuremberg"", and ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" left out.
It is with great
pleasure that we present the first premiere of ""
im·mu·ni·ty""as a full-length play, presented by The Manhattan
Repertory Theatre’s Play Development program.
The one-act
production of"" im·mu·ni·ty"" won 1st place
at NYC's 2014 Venus Theater Festival. This gripping tale has been expanded to a full-length play, and
your support can help bring it to the world!
The Story:

Auschwitz,
1942. Torn from her family, Gita Weitz stands
locked in a dark interrogation room with nothing
to hold on to but her faith. She is suddenly confronted by an SS officer
whose voice is familiar. Doctor Schuller, once known to Gita as Franz  was her
most prized pupil during her days as a Berlin schoolteacher.  Gita’s
relief at this recognition is short lived, however. 
Schuller,
raised amongst the Jews and taught to regard them as equals, has since been
re-educated to believe Jews are the enemy. Believing himself misled by the
teacher he trusted and had been smitten with since childhood, he now sees the
virtues of tolerance, humanity and compassion she instilled in him as
detrimental weaknesses. 
Schuller
designs a plan to make himself immune to his humanity by physically,
psychologically and emotionally torturing Gita each day until he is no longer
affected by her pain. 
Can a flicker of humanity overcome evil or hope to survive in Auschwitz? A scene from the award-winning 50-minute play, “im·mu·ni·ty” 

Our History:
Read for yourself the incredible floodgate of emotions opened by this play by reviewers and audiences alike. ""Mesmerizing! Applause isn’t enough to show appreciation for the experience”- Glen Quentin of
StageBuddy
“Shari Umansky
immortalized a powerful and haunting picture of the darkest color of the soul
of humanity.”- Franco
Moschetti, Artistic
Director of The Cabrini Repertory Theater 

“For 50 minutes I didn’t take a
single breath.”- Doreen
Firestone, THE PRODIGAL DAUGHTER 

The comments didn't stop with praise. People wanted more of the characters, the story and the journey.“What
were they like before they got to Auschwitz?"" ""What were Gita and Schuller like as teacher and student?""""What was the relationship like between Gita and Joseph?""""What was Schuller like before he joined the SS?"" Now the riveting tale continues to a shocking conclusion!

What started
with this post-festival buzz is now picking up steam around the country. We’ve
already had interest expressed from theaters in Washington DC, Miami, New York,
and even Israel.
Our Goal Our first priority is to present the story in as
historically accurate and emotionally authentic way possible. We will record a
professional video and pass it along to JCC’s, Educational Programs,
professional theaters and film producers around the world in order to reach as
large an audience as possible. Of course, the more money we raise, the greater
the likelihood of a successful campaign...and we can't do it without your
help!How you
can help!Phase One is achieving our biggest initial goal --creating
a compelling, powerful and entertaining evening of theater, leaving audiences
awe-struck. When larger theater companies develop work, the process can take
months. We only have weeks to put up a show that producers
want to give money to and theaters want to adopt — and we know that making it
great will be a monumental task. In order for this to occur, a few certain
things are necessary for a complete and satisfying evening and campaign: 
Programs
Sets
and Props
Costumes
Reserved
Tickets for Potential Investors
Posters,
Programs and Signage
Rehearsal
space
Travel
expenses for actors
Lighting
and sound 
Marketing
and Promoting
Press
packages
Our
show dates are February, 4th and 7th, with more dates being added. Tickets are
$20 at the door. To reserve tickets, email MRTRESERVE@gmail.com with your
preferred date and number of tickets. 
Once
the run at Manhattan Repertory Theater is complete, we move to… 
Phase Two is creating an “im·mu·ni·ty”
promotional theatrical trailer to submit to national theaters, festivals, producers and potential investors.
At the same time we will be promoting “im·mu·ni·ty” locally
with the goal of touring of educational facilities, JCC’s and more!

Playwright Shari
Umansky on the birth of Immunity:
""Despite 10 years
of Hebrew school and spending most of my adult life researching the Holocaust,
I felt both unqualified and unprepared to write the terrifying tale of Schuller
and Gita.
I traveled to
Auschwitz & Auschwitz II, Birkenau and spent two full days touring the
camps with a private guide. I left the camps knowing that at the soul of the
story of “im·mu·ni·ty” would lie a question: Whether a flicker of humanity could
survive in Auschwitz despite the most heinous and tenacious efforts to
extinguish it.
“im·mu·ni·ty” is
the culmination of my life’s work, both a revelation of horrors and a vehicle
to promote the endurance of humanity.
By contributing to"" im·mu·ni·ty in NYC”, you're helping to awaken, preserve
and share a global understanding of humanity –and show that the Holocaust is

What is Port Cities & Port Cities NYC





Over the course of approximately 5-7 years, The Public Works Department, which includes award-winning visual theater-maker Talya Chalef and awesome media designer Sofi Yuditskaya,  will devise five port cities performance events around the world in collaboration with local and international artists.
Each port cities performance will contain the same elements:

a non theatre performance space close or on the port.
a projected video montage sequence depicting ‘movement’ particular to that city
an exploration into that particular city’s connection with Dutch trade route history (and its own location on the route).

Local myths, legends and folklores will be explored against the backdrop of current contemporary issues affecting each city. The port cities performance events will be available online on a port cities website allowing participating cities to interact and reflect on the project as a whole. At the end of the journey, the sum of the five cities will be compiled into a DVD documentary available for each city's host festival/organisation to keep as a performance in ‘five movements’ like an opera.

<h3><strong>WHO ARE WE?</strong></h3>
<p>Let us introduce ourselves! We are Michelle Ciccotelli and Stephanie Occhipinti, Co-Founders of Amateur Hour. Hi there. We are women. We like comedy. Women are funny, despite what you may have heard.</p>
<h3>WHAT ARE WE DOING?</h3>
<p><strong>Gutenberg! The Musical!</strong> is a hilarious musical spoof in which two aspiring Broadway writers perform a staged reading of what might be the greatest musical of all time. With an unending supply of enthusiasm, the two playwrights play all the parts and sing all the songs in the hopes of finding a Broadway producer to make all their dreams come true. Though the play is originally written for two male characters, Michelle Ciccotelli and Stephanie Occhipinti will be featured in the leading roles.</p>
<h3>WHY ARE WE DOING IT?</h3>
<p>We recently graduated from Boston University’s School of Theatre.  As we neared the end of our college experience and shifted our focus to post-grad professional life, we noticed the work we were hungry for didn’t exist in the ways we had hoped. Comedic roles for young women are few and far between. The ones that do exist often lack dimension or are written more simplistically than roles written for men. We wanted to create a space where women with an interest in comedy will have the opportunity to grow and develop those artistic muscles. Each project brings us one step closer to gender parity in the world of comedy.</p>
<p><strong>Gutenberg! The Musical!</strong> has been near and dear to our hearts for many years, but suddenly we find ourselves wondering why it has only ever been produced by men. The humor is reliant on the versatility of the actors, not their genders.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The goal of this production is to create work that we, as young artists, are passionate about and feel needs to be seen. This show is about relationships: when to wait for love, and two people who can't seem to find their way back to each other. This is our first attempt to say something, and we need your support in order to succeed. New York New Works gives us the opportunity to be a part of a festival with many connections–this is our chance to get the work seen as well as our actors, which is the most important thing we can be doing as young, emerging artists.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that not everyone is able to financially contribute, but every bit helps. Even spreading the word or sharing the campaign would make a huge difference.  Use that social media for good! </p>
<p>We also hope you will come to our show; the most important thing is to get this show onstage for you to see.  We're ready to tell you a really great story and perhaps surprise you along the way.  </p>

What We Need & What You Get
This is Red Wit Production Company's first bout in the New York Scene, and with the majority of the team coming straight out of undergrad, we are looking to the artistic community to help us get there! We've got a heck of lot of passion and drive and we are ready to take the city by storm.  

For this particular production, our main concerns are raising funds in order to pay for festival fees, rehearsal/audition space, and artistic stipends. Our goal is to pay everyone involved for their hard work, talent, and time.
We are so beyond grateful for you, as you are a huge part of making this happen – so we want you to benefit as well! There are a long list of perks, but every dollar counts (truly every single one)

<p>We made ‘CELEBRATION’, and performed it in December 2016, as a response to the most politically unstable year we could remember, but which was also the year we met each other, became good friends, and had felt the happiest in our own lives. In short, CELEBRATION is a show about reconciling those two contradictory feelings and finding joy in uncertain times.</p>

<p>This one-women show follows on from Bruised Sky’s 2016 hit Villain and we are delighted to have confirmed a run at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival with Pleasance Theatre. </p>

<h3>Martin Murphy – Playwright and Artistic Director</h3>
<p>Martin's previous writing credits for theatre include Worlds (VAULT Festival), RockStar (Lyric Hammersmith, YHWF), Villain (Underbelly)  Manor (Soho Theatre) and Barren (Old Vic) as well as numerous works at venues including Liverpool Everyman Theatre. For screen Martin's work includes the short film Poisoned. </p>

<h2>Why we need you</h2>
<p>Taking a show to Edinburgh is an expensive undertaking, but a huge opportunity. Due to the success of our previous show Villain we have been able to reinvest profits into this show and secured some private backing which has helped us to cover some costs including travel and accommodation.  However we are also hoping to secure investments, of every size, to help us cover these costs:</p>
<p>- Paying our actress and marketing team.</p>
<p>- Pay for marketing materials such as flyers, posters and brochure listings .</p>
<p>We are looking to raise £1000 to support this show and give this important story a future life.  Our fundraising objectives mean that every penny of money made through ticket sales up at the fringe can then be reinvested into a London run and UK tour of this play.</p>
<h2>How to donate</h2>
<p>You can donate via this Indiegogo campaign where we have a range of fantastic rewards waiting for you for donations ranging from £10 to £50.</p>

Every summer, hundreds of artists produce groundbreaking works of theatre throughout venues in the city, and this year, we would love our project to be among them.The Solo ShowConfessions of a Former Boy Detective is an honest and humorous solo play at this year's Hollywood Fringe Festival that tells the story of a young man who was once half of an illustrious child detective duo with his twin sister. He reflects on his old cases, his struggles with mental illness, and the now broken relationship between him and his sister. It is a frank meditation on childhood, addiction, queerness, and siblinghood, and we believe it is a story that needs to be told.Link to the show website - http://hff21.co/7199Your Contribution MattersIt's exciting to bring live theatre back to our lives after over a year of quarantine! However, producing theatre can be costly, especially for young artists. That’s why we’re asking for your contribution to help us produce this piece and continue to create bold and exciting theatre. With your donations, we can tell this important story and use the opportunity to begin dialogue, create work for other young artists, and join the upcoming generation of creators who are challenging what theatre can and should be, for everyone, forever.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Hi, we're F*It Club!</h3>
<p>You know, in the spirit of ""why are we waiting for people to give us work; f*it, let's make our own work!""</p>
<p>Since 2011, we have worked exclusively on short-form projects: short film, short theatre, and short-term events. To date:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>We've worked with over 360 artists</strong></li>
<li><strong>Presented over 50 world-premiere, commissioned pieces of theater (plus films, web series, pop-up bar experiences, retreats, Halloween events, site-specific work, and more)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Been nominated for 17 New York Innovative Theatre Awards (with 2 wins!)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Hired TV people, Broadway people, Pulitzer Prize-winning people...and everyone in between, with our mission always being to bridge the gap between established and emerging artists.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Coming up on 2019-2020, we're entering our ninth and tenth seasons, respectively. <i><strong>And in 2020, our tenth year, we'll be bringing F*It Club and our tentpole piece, The Spring Fling to a close.</strong></i> (Sad! But also YAY! TEN F*ING YEARS!)</p>
<p>For almost a decade, we've relied primarily on individual donations and ticket sales to help keep our work going, without much, if any, government support or grants. We're just going to ask for money from you *<i>one last time</i>* to get us through Spring Fling: On Screen in 2019, and Spring Fling: Finale in 2020.</p>
<p>We're so proud of all of the work we've made, relationships we've formed, and the impact we've had in the off-off-Broadway community. We need your help, however, to see us through to the end of ten years and send off our work with the respect and celebration it deserves!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>More specifically:</h3>
<p>In 2019, we're producing THREE new, world-premiere films, written by two former Spring Fling playwrights, Hilary Bettis (<i>The Americans</i>), and Ashlin Halfnight (<i>Bloodline</i>), as well as Allyson Morgan (Tribeca Film Festival). All of the films will also be co-produced by Allyson and Academy Award-winning producer Mara Kassin (yes, really!) Each film is a distinct meditation on death, but will also be a stand alone piece that we intend to submit to festivals world-wide.</p>
<p>We anticipate <strong>the budget for all three of these films landing between $10-15K</strong>, going to cast and crew salaries, insurance, equipment rentals, transportation, catering, and post production services, among others.</p>
<p>In 2020, we'll blow it out with our final return year of The Spring Fling: Finale, featuring ten world-premiere commissioned plays and ten performances in honor of our tenth year. Our intention is to bring back five alumni playwrights and add five new. <strong>The Spring Fling always traditionally costs between $8-$10K</strong>, with money going to rehearsal space, performance space, insurance, copies, props, costumes, set, lights, sound, and more.</p>
<p>As you can see, we're ultimately reaching out to fund about half of our last two years, and hope to bring in the remainder through grants and ticket sales.  The more we are able to bring in, the better both of these productions will be and run - our intention is not to keep any money in the bank at the end of 2020. We've learned how to be frugal and make ends meet, but we'd really like to step it up these last two years</p>

<h3>But don't just take our word for it:</h3>
<p>""The writing here is insightful and often funny"" <strong>- The New York Times</strong></p>
<p>“Shows like ‘Spring-Fling’ are rare. Indomitably weird and high-brow, but without being esoteric to the point of pretension. The writing is unique, the direction excellent, and the cast on-point. I highly recommend it if you need to see theatre that is unlike every other show on or off Broadway. It’s what I wish every one-act festival could be. This was a venue for honest theatrical experimentation, performed by people who unquestionably knew what they were doing. I love that. I recommend checking out F* It Club’s work in future.” – <strong>On Stage Blog</strong></p>
<p>“F*It Club ... have come up with an enjoyable invitation in this entertaining night. It gave me an appetizing taste of some gifted writers, actors, and directors, and kept me engaged and interested throughout much of the evening. Overall, it was a highly enjoyable night of theater. F*It Club is right, you do deserve a Spring Fling.” <strong>- NYTheatre.com</strong></p>
<p>“The Spring Fling has its S*IT together. Not only are all of the pieces thoughtful, but the overall production values make for a cohesive and enjoyable evening of theatre. Producers Allyson Morgan and Mara Kassin have assembled a stellar team of playwrights, performers and directors to bring these works to life. ...includes work by artists who are simply good at what they do. This evening of quick and high-quality work is well worth your time and attention.” <br/><strong>- Theatre is Easy</strong></p>
<p>""A sumptuous theatrical buffet...It is thrilling to see how each playwright has imaginatively explored the theme and developed rounded, detailed characters and powerful dialogue. It's a gratifying marathon of plays that gives your feel-good synapses a workout. It’s such a lot of fun to watch this carousel of creativity whip past. It’s a wonderful project to support. “The Spring Fling” is a well rehearsed, sleek, sophisticated evening where you can see the evidence of a strong production and design team ensuring a high standard of work...an extremely enjoyable night at the theater."" <strong>- Stage Biz</strong><br/><br/>“The results this year held a few surprises, some standouts, and never failed to be fascinating. Overall, another strong year for F*IT club, showcasing plays that one legitimately feels would not exist anywhere but here. More than that though, it should once again be stressed how few evenings of one-act plays are assembled with any sense of cohesion. Spring Fling categorically feels like it is put together with care, nuance, and with the aim to produce a night of plays that flow gracefully from one to the other, rather than zig-zagging across a wild spectrum of content, and quality, as most similar festivals do. Everything here is consistently enjoyable, comparable in its content, and creative in its presentation.” <strong>– PopDust</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>In Closing:</h3>
<p>We love you and are so grateful for any and all support. And again: <strong>this is the last time we'll ask for your help!</strong> So maybe consider throwing in a couple extra bucks to get us to 2020? </p>
<p>We would sincerely love and appreciate if you could help spread the word for our campaign with your friends, family, and colleagues. Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and other social media are all great ways to get the word out.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your support.</p>
<p>Yours (for two more years of f*ing up film, theatre, and events),<br/>Allyson + F*It Club</p>

We'll be adding more throughout the campaign, so keep checking back! We have theatre, film, and assorted miscellaneous perks to cater to all of your heart's desires. (Well. Some of them, anyway.)
Truly, any help you can give MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE, including shout outs and sharing via social media and forwarding on email!
We have only ever been on a biennial fundraising schedule for these nine (almost ten) years, demonstrating that we’re both fiscally responsible and extremely cautious about how we use your money throughout the year. Hopefully our track record of not just surviving, but thriving, over this time thus far should help demonstrate the value of  your contribution.
SO SMASH THAT DONATE BUTTON!

But don't just take our word for it:
""The writing here is insightful and often funny"" - The New York Times
“Shows like ‘Spring-Fling’ are rare. Indomitably weird and high-brow, but without being esoteric to the point of pretension. The writing is unique, the direction excellent, and the cast on-point. I highly recommend it if you need to see theatre that is unlike every other show on or off Broadway. It’s what I wish every one-act festival could be. This was a venue for honest theatrical experimentation, performed by people who unquestionably knew what they were doing. I love that. I recommend checking out F* It Club’s work in future.” – On Stage Blog
“F*It Club ... have come up with an enjoyable invitation in this entertaining night. It gave me an appetizing taste of some gifted writers, actors, and directors, and kept me engaged and interested throughout much of the evening. Overall, it was a highly enjoyable night of theater. F*It Club is right, you do deserve a Spring Fling.” - NYTheatre.com
“The Spring Fling has its S*IT together. Not only are all of the pieces thoughtful, but the overall production values make for a cohesive and enjoyable evening of theatre. Producers Allyson Morgan and Mara Kassin have assembled a stellar team of playwrights, performers and directors to bring these works to life. ...includes work by artists who are simply good at what they do. This evening of quick and high-quality work is well worth your time and attention.” - Theatre is Easy
""A sumptuous theatrical buffet...It is thrilling to see how each playwright has imaginatively explored the theme and developed rounded, detailed characters and powerful dialogue. It's a gratifying marathon of plays that gives your feel-good synapses a workout. It’s such a lot of fun to watch this carousel of creativity whip past. It’s a wonderful project to support. “The Spring Fling” is a well rehearsed, sleek, sophisticated evening where you can see the evidence of a strong production and design team ensuring a high standard of work...an extremely enjoyable night at the theater."" - Stage Biz“The results this year held a few surprises, some standouts, and never failed to be fascinating. Overall, another strong year for F*IT club, showcasing plays that one legitimately feels would not exist anywhere but here. More than that though, it should once again be stressed how few evenings of one-act plays are assembled with any sense of cohesion. Spring Fling categorically feels like it is put together with care, nuance, and with the aim to produce a night of plays that flow gracefully from one to the other, rather than zig-zagging across a wild spectrum of content, and quality, as most similar festivals do. Everything here is consistently enjoyable, comparable in its content, and creative in its presentation.” – PopDust

In Closing:
We love you and are so grateful for any and all support. And again: this is the last time we'll ask for your help! So maybe consider throwing in a couple extra bucks to get us to 2020? 
We would sincerely love and appreciate if you could help spread the word for our campaign with your friends, family, and colleagues. Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and other social media are all great ways to get the word out.
Thanks in advance for your support.

<h3>Who Are You &amp; What Do You Want?</h3>
<p>Alright you primitive screw heads, listen up. Tacoma Belly Dance has been putting on themed belly dance shows since 2013 and we are excited to announce our 4th run of the hit show, Horrific!: A Night of Horror Themed Belly Dance! What's that? Horror...themed...belly dance? You heard that right. 450 people agree, that Horrific is a hell of a show. Seeing that our show has grown from a small studio show to a public theater experience we are looking to up the ante and put on the best show yet. To do so, we need support from viewers like you.</p>
<p>Tacoma Belly Dance started with its owner and artistic director, Kat Welsh. Kat is a long time belly dance perform who teaches classical American Cabaret Belly Dance weekly at Tacoma Dance Studios. She has always had a strong love for horror and wanted to fuse the two loves into a show that would be fun, all inclusive, and a littel bit weird. Ok, it's real weird. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To fund the show is not a cheap task:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are asking $3,000 to help fund the initial deposit for the theater. Last year we utilized the Rialto Theater in downtown Tacoma. We so enjoyed the space, and it truly allows us to grow in our audience as well as give dancers an amazing stage. The Rialto can hold up to 700 people, allowing our annual audience growth of 50%. The Broadway Center (owners of the Rialto) helped provide us with a lighting crew, backstage crew, ushers, security, and ticket sales. As a small company, these kind of services are invaluable. We are also interested in keeping our show in Tacoma as we truly believe in local art and business.</li>
<li>""Yeah yeah yeah, but what do I get out if it?"" Perks! We want to make sure you know your money is well invested. In return, we have added perks. Those include a ""thank you"" in the program, Stickers, Merchandise, Tickets to the show, backstage passes, private belly dance lessons, photos with the cast, and even a role in the show!</li>
<li>If we don't reach the goal, all funds will still go to the production of the show. The show must go on!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our show brings something different and unique to the horror scene. It showcases professional belly dance performers through the art of storytelling. It also houses a space for people of all genders, ages, and body types to showcase their art. When you contribute to our show, it also supports the artists who deserve a space on stage. </p>
<ul>
<li>Your contribution means that we can focus on the art and direction of the show making a better overall product. Peace of mind means a lot to us!</li>
<li>Being that this is our 4th year, we have a strong handle on how to make a successful production. Help us provide the show to you.</li>
<li>The people who work on the show have other life commitments outside of dance. Any help beforehand makes the process much smoother.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Putting on a production is a risky process! We invest a large amount of time, energy, and money into the show. It is always possible to fail and not sell the tickets that we hope to sell. We hope to overcome these battles with these key elements. </p>
<ul>
<li>This is our 4th year for the show. Each year it has more than doubled in attendance with new and old faces returning every time. Last years show sold just over 450 tickets. If we continue the growth, we should see numbers of around 600 attendees. </li>
<li>This is also not a new adventure for us. Tacoma Belly Dance has been putting on successful dance productions since 2014 and smaller monthly shows since 2013. </li>
<li>Our plan is to merge into different avenues for marketing. This includes more involvement at Crypticon (a yearly horror convention), local horror-themed shows, presence with bands in the shock rock scene, and heavier social media presence and content creation. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share our event, IndieGoGo, or website both on social media and in person!</li>

<h3>What if you could live forever? On New Year's Eve in 1625, Will Timeson and Jack Mercer discover the secret of immortality – an elixir that will grant them the gift of eternal life. But is it a gift? When the two men fall in love with the same woman -- a beautiful, young woman with a dark, painful secret – the stage is set for a grand, musical epic about friendship, love, betrayal and redemption spanning several tumultuous centuries and set to a sweeping, romantic score.</h3>
<p>My name is Brett Boles, and I've written the book, music, and lyrics to FOREVERMAN, which will have its world premiere at the New York Musical Theatre Festival (NYMF) this July.  NYMF is the largest and most prestigious musical theatre festival in the world, and we are incredibly excited to have the opportunity to put this show up this summer.  NYMF is our first major step on the road to Broadway and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>YOU can help make this happen.  Wouldn't it be awesome to see this show on Broadway and know that you helped get it there?  New, original work simply cannot happen without grass roots support to build a fan base and propel it forward.  The world (and producers) need to know that YOU want to see this succeed.  They need to know that YOU believe in it.</p>
<p>So please support FOREVERMAN on its journey from my home studio to the rest of the world.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise a total of $85,000 in order to bring this show to life the way it deserves to be.  The goal here is set at $5,000.  We would LOVE to exceed this.</p>
<p>Your money goes to pay our dedicated actors, design staff, directors, and production crew.  Some of your dollars will be used to pay for rehearsal space, copies of scripts and scores, orchestrations for a six-piece band, advertising and publicity, and perhaps even a much needed coffee on tech day!</p>
<p>Indiegogo keeps only 4% of the money we raise if we reach our $5,000 goal.  If we do NOT meet our goal, we keep all but 9%.  </p>
<p>Make sure to check out the perks you'll receive as well, including (at varying levels of contribution) a baseball cap, tote bad, and a T-shirt - all with the FOREVERMAN logo.  Be one of the few to have an ORIGINAL piece of FOREVERMAN merchandise before it evolves into the Broadway version...it may be worth something one day!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>NYMF is our first big step on the road to Broadway and the rest of the world.  Let's make this a sensation.  The message of this musical is universal, and could have a huge impact on people from every corner of the earth.  With the internet available to us, there are no limits to what we can accomplish with this piece.  NYMF's motto is ""Changing the world, 30 musicals at a time.""  It only takes <strong>one</strong> to change the world.  Let's make it FOREVERMAN.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute financially, please spread the word on Facebook and Twitter and other social media.  Share the songs with friends and family.  Each person has the ability to <strong>EXPONENTIALLY</strong> increase the circulation of this material.  Let's do it!</p>

We need to raise a total of $85,000 in order to bring this show to life the way it deserves to be.  The goal here is set at $5,000.  We would LOVE to exceed this.
Your money goes to pay our dedicated actors, design staff, directors, and production crew.  Some of your dollars will be used to pay for rehearsal space, copies of scripts and scores, orchestrations for a six-piece band, advertising and publicity, and perhaps even a much needed coffee on tech day!
Indiegogo keeps only 4% of the money we raise if we reach our $5,000 goal.  If we do NOT meet our goal, we keep all but 9%.  
Make sure to check out the perks you'll receive as well, including (at varying levels of contribution) a baseball cap, tote bad, and a T-shirt - all with the FOREVERMAN logo.  Be one of the few to have an ORIGINAL piece of FOREVERMAN merchandise before it evolves into the Broadway version...it may be worth something one day!


The Impact
NYMF is our first big step on the road to Broadway and the rest of the world.  Let's make this a sensation.  The message of this musical is universal, and could have a huge impact on people from every corner of the earth.  With the internet available to us, there are no limits to what we can accomplish with this piece.  NYMF's motto is ""Changing the world, 30 musicals at a time.""  It only takes one to change the world.  Let's make it FOREVERMAN.


Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't contribute financially, please spread the word on Facebook and Twitter and other social media.  Share the songs with friends and family.  Each person has the ability to EXPONENTIALLY increase the circulation of this material.  Let's do it!

<p>PIECES OF PAPER - ASPIRATIONS OF 9/11 is a visceral multimedia meditation on the power of human compassion in action the week of September 11, 2001. A large ensemble of performers representing every walk of life take you on an emotional theatrical journey, using movement, video, text and an original soundcsape by internationally acclaimed composer Anton Batagov, conceived and directed by Michael Simon Hall, theater artist and 9/11 first responder. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This story of hope is inspired by actual handwritten documents created the week of 9/11 by grassroots volunteers at the Chelsea Piers Support Center in New York City. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The project has been in development since the spring of 2010, and was recently awarded the opportunity to present at the acclaimed producing organization, HERE, NYC, May 12 - 14, 2011, to work toward the goal of a full fall production for the tenth anniversary of 9/11.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>PoP strives to be a source of healing for all peoples everywhere affected by the attacks of September 11, 2001. By depicting the actions of grassroots volunteers that week, PoP hopes to inspire others to compassionate action in the name of our fallen heros and departed loved ones, as a way of never forgetting. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Supporting the 9/11 Community</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The production also plans to raise awareness and monetary support for various September 11-related community groups. One example of how we are doing this is by providing a venue for the <strong>First Responders Alliance, a program of Tuesday's Children</strong>, to enlighten the audience on their mission and resources for helping first responders and their families everywhere, as well as ways to volunteer. <strong>Tuesday's Children</strong> is a national non-profit organization supporting the children of 9/11 and others impacted by global terrorism. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The impetus for this production, the pieces of paper themselves, were collected by the creator Michael Simon Hall on Sunday, September 16th, 2001, when the grassroots volunteer operation at Chelsea Piers where he was volunteering was shut down by the Office of Emergency Management, and the hundreds of volunteers were sent home. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>These artifacts were featured at the New-York Historical Society in an exhibit called ""Radical Hospitality"", and have been on loan to the National September 11 Memorial Museum.</p></span></span></span></h3>

The box office success we experienced in Mississauga indicates that there is genuine interest in this compelling chapter of Canadian history. Our cast is dedicated to bringing our production to Halifax this spring to perform at the Alderney Landing Theatre from May 9th to 12th, 2012. As a self-producing student company, we are unfortunately ineligible for most government grants. We are relying on support from family, friends, and other individuals to make this ambitious tour possible. Any donation will help to cover the myriad of costs associated with a theatrical tour – everything from paying our theatre rental fees to laundering soldier uniforms! We are truly grateful for any support you can offer us.

Well Fought Theatre Company presents the Theatre Erindale production of...
 
December 1917: The Halifax Explosion

Where Does Your Money Go?
Funds raised are purely for production, not personal costs! We're aiming to raise $6,000.00 here on Indiegogo and $6,000.00 from other sources. We'll be depending on ticket sales to cover the remaining $8,900.00 of our total production budget!
* Alderney Theatre rental cost
* Paying our Artistic Team (director, costume designer, choreographer, music director)
* Paying the Alderney Team (technicians, ushers, house manager)
* Transporting our set/costumes 
* Costume Fees (Wardrobe Assistant, dry-cleaning, mending/building) 
* Promotional Costs (poster/program printing, newspaper/radio ads)

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Slapdash Festival started in 2010 with the Old Vic Tunnels, to showcase the best in UK improvisation. Over the two years since, the festival has expanded from a couple of days to nearly a week. This year our ambitions are even bigger.</p>
<p>The festival is being put together by Ryan Millar (Artistic Director) and Jules Munns (Executive Producer). Both are passionate about improv and are experienced performers, with over 15 years of improvisation between them. They perform regularly with The Maydays, Marbles and Silly String Theory. Ryan had some international connections, and after two years of a national festival, Jules was ready to expand on the success of the first two Slapdashes. </p>
<p>And Slapdash International was born. Well almost... The festival kicks off in a little over six weeks, and we're looking for some funding to help deliver on the scope of the project.</p>
<p>We'll be bringing improvisers from all over, from Vienna to Vancouver and points in-between, and we need to make sure that they can eat and have places to sleep while they're here. We'd also like to pay them for their time and talents.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So here's what we need to pay for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publicity materials</li>
<li>Equipment rental</li>
<li>Per diems for performers</li>
<li>Travel expenses</li>
</ul>
<p>We're looking for $1,300 (£800) which should just about cover the shortfall in our budget. We're going for 'revenue neutral' (i.e. not going broke).</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Improv can be powerful theatre, as well as a positive experience in the lives of improvisers. Creativity, personal growth, having laughs and sometimes surprising yourself with stories that are told only once. </p>
<p>Contributing to this project will help us put on an important and powerful festival that will bring some of the finest improvisers from around the world to London, to collaborate, perform and teach with local improvisers and audiences.</p>
<p>The improv festival circuit is an incubator of talent and ideas - by bringing in accomplished talent from other countries we strengthen the work that happens in the UK. We also build audiences.</p>
<p>If you're not based in the UK, but love improv, you'll feel good about helping London and the UK grow its passionate improv community.</p>
<p>This is the third Slapdash Festival, each of the last two have grown in scope, but this festival is a whole other phase. That's why we're looking to the Indiegogo community for help.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you're not able to contribute any money, that's cool. It would still be great if you were able to help us spread the word. </p>
<ul>
<li>Use the Indiegogo share tools to help get the message out.</li>
<li>If you know someone who might be interested and able to help tell them about this.</li>
<li>If you're able to, come see a show and have a drink at the bar. Meet some great people, laugh, watch some great theatre.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>That’s all there is to it.</p></div>","Short Summary
The Slapdash Festival started in 2010 with the Old Vic Tunnels, to showcase the best in UK improvisation. Over the two years since, the festival has expanded from a couple of days to nearly a week. This year our ambitions are even bigger.

What We Need & What You Get
So here's what we need to pay for:

Publicity materials
Equipment rental

Travel expenses

We're looking for $1,300 (£800) which should just about cover the shortfall in our budget. We're going for 'revenue neutral' (i.e. not going broke).
The Impact


Improv can be powerful theatre, as well as a positive experience in the lives of improvisers. Creativity, personal growth, having laughs and sometimes surprising yourself with stories that are told only once. 
Contributing to this project will help us put on an important and powerful festival that will bring some of the finest improvisers from around the world to London, to collaborate, perform and teach with local improvisers and audiences.
The improv festival circuit is an incubator of talent and ideas - by bringing in accomplished talent from other countries we strengthen the work that happens in the UK. We also build audiences.
If you're not based in the UK, but love improv, you'll feel good about helping London and the UK grow its passionate improv community.
This is the third Slapdash Festival, each of the last two have grown in scope, but this festival is a whole other phase. That's why we're looking to the Indiegogo community for help.


Other Ways You Can Help
If you're not able to contribute any money, that's cool. It would still be great if you were able to help us spread the word. 

Use the Indiegogo share tools to help get the message out.
If you know someone who might be interested and able to help tell them about this.
If you're able to, come see a show and have a drink at the bar. Meet some great people, laugh, watch some great theatre.

About Grassroots Illinois Action-

Grassroots Illinois Action is building a permanent, independent grassroots electoral movement to promote a progressive agenda that values all of our city’s residents, all of our children, all of our neighborhoods. We set out to unite Chicagoans in an effort to build real independent political power in and for our communities. We work to expand the political influence of our members by supporting candidates who embrace our vision. Additionally, we support our grassroots leaders by providing them with the tools they need to win political power in their communities.

<p>HOOLIGAN Theatre Co. Provides many things for us UCLA theatre kids: a family, a home away from home, a place to just be ourselves; most importantly, though, it provides a theatrical, educational and inspiring environment for our audiences. UCLA students get to see each HOOLIGAN show for free, a service we proudly provide - everyone should have the opportunity to experience live theatre. </p>
<p>I am one of the newest members of HOOLIGAN and could not be more proud of this beautiful organization. Entirely student-run, we HOOLIGANS come together multiple times a year to put on magical shows for our audiences in record time - this time we have just 6 weeks! - but, even then, we do more. We treat each other like family, we care about one another, and we always strive to not only bring a story to life because it is fun but because it is meaningful. </p>
<p><strong>Why HAIR?</strong></p>
<p>Hair is set in the 1960s, the age of flower children, peaceful (and some non-peaceful) protesters, and psychedelic vibes. In this age of America, musicals on Broadway were idealized: social issues weren't brought to the stage, rock musical was still Broadway Taboo and traditionalism was the norm. Hair changed all of that - Hair began the rock musical movement, inspiring shows such as RENT, Footloose and Rock of Ages to come to the stage. Hair also discussed the real problems of the age, such as the stigmas of the young adults who were just trying to be themselves and be free and liberated and spread the love. Hair broke the ice; after Hair, America's youth started to speak. </p>
<p>Why does it matter now? Why is it so imperative that HOOLIGAN put on this show in 6 weeks? I'll tell you why: because the lessons Hair teaches are still relevant today. Freedom, expression, acceptance, love, and open-mindedness are still values today's teens need to learn and adopt. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>Why TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS?</strong></p>
<p>Well, actually, our goal is $30,000.00! Since we are entirely
student-run, we rely on grants and cast fundraising to put on our shows. Grants
sometimes cover about a third of our budget, but that is if we’re lucky.
Basically, it’s all up to us to personally raise as much as we can!</p>
<p>I’m trying to rally up as much as I can, and if you can’t
contribute, THAT IS OKAY! Direct this page to someone who might be able to –
everything counts. We appreciate every single bit of help we get. </p>
<p>$30,000.00 is a lot, but if we all work together, I know we
can do it. THE SHOW MUST GO ON! </p>
<p><strong>THANK YOU!</strong></p>
<p>Thank you so much for reading this, for watching the video,
for even clicking on the link to this campaign. HOOLIGAN Theatre Company would
not be in its 10<sup>th</sup> season without all of you helping us reach our

And  a surprise (to all except those who voted me ""Best Actor in the State of Utah"" in high school -- true story!).  Such is the lot of the performer/introvert: ""He seemed so quiet, kept to himself …""  </p>
<p>It would have gone nowhere without Martha Rynberg and the Solo Performance Workshop. Learn more <a href=""http://www.soloperformanceworkshop.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>!  I've since gone back to SPW to write and perform three more pieces (see all four of them <a href=""http://andrewgeorgepeck.wordpress.com/category/solo-performance/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>). </p>
<p>It's no longer surprising that I've had a lot to say about teaching troubles, manly trials, OKCupid exploits, PTSD, and fairy grandparenting.</p>
<p><b>So, it's Fall 2014 and I'm ready to write, produce, and perform a much longer show! </b></p>
<p>I can't say for sure what this show will ""be about.""  (Details, details…)  I can say is that Martha Rynberg and SPW collaborators will again inspire and shape the work; and a piece of 40-ish minutes is 100% guaranteed to be performed in mid-November of this year. </p>

It was a great joy and success. And  a surprise (to all except those who voted me ""Best Actor in the State of Utah"" in high school -- true story!).  Such is the lot of the performer/introvert: ""He seemed so quiet, kept to himself …""  
It would have gone nowhere without Martha Rynberg and the Solo Performance Workshop. Learn more here!  I've since gone back to SPW to write and perform three more pieces (see all four of them here). 
It's no longer surprising that I've had a lot to say about teaching troubles, manly trials, OKCupid exploits, PTSD, and fairy grandparenting.
So, it's Fall 2014 and I'm ready to write, produce, and perform a much longer show! 
I can't say for sure what this show will ""be about.""  (Details, details…)  I can say is that Martha Rynberg and SPW collaborators will again inspire and shape the work; and a piece of 40-ish minutes is 100% guaranteed to be performed in mid-November of this year. 
Gulp!
With any luck, this will also become the nervous system, backbone, skeleton, vascular system -- choose your favorite core bodily function related metaphor --  for what we call in the biz a ""full-length"" show. 
Yowza-gulp!


Here's what I will offer to my audiences in a temporally-expanded dose:


A surprising (possibly unpredictable) resonance and insight. 

Relief through compassionate, irreverent laughter. 

To be totally stopped, however briefly, in their tracks. 

Wonder. 

Delight. 
To be challenged as in to squirm (possibly to wince) in their seats. 

An expansion of social awareness and conscience.

An appreciation for the power of saying something just-so.




  What I Need & What You Get
This is a big leap creatively but I feel more than ready for it. It's just the big stretch financially that's keeping me up at night. So, I'd like to raise $1,500 for:


Workshop fees and coaching

Rehearsal time and space

Videography of the performance(s)


BART to/from San Francisco

Chocolate
Coffee

In asking for your support, I'm taking my work more seriously and developing the means to sustain it. Rest assured that whatever progress I make toward this goal, I am doing this show!

<h3>We Need Your Help</h3>
<p>Please help donate to our foundation so we can keep exploring as artist and making our dreams come true. We have so much planned for the future but we need your help to help us get there! Any donation big or small will help. WE cant do this without you</p>
<h3><img alt=""QDT"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s7.postimage.org/gfuwuds97/200235_10150126553334015_7278030_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<h2>Who We Are</h2>
<p><strong>Qualia Dance Theater</strong> was founded by Christina Nova Zych and myself (Tiffany Stacey). The two of us met while earning our bachlors degree at the Califorinia Institute of the Arts (CalArts). We are a relatively new company, forming steadily with purpose! As an emerging dance company in the Los Angeles area we are striving to pick our feet off the ground and get the ball rolling. Our mission is to help build a strong foundation for Calarts and the dance community in the local area, while maintaining the creation of strong, conceptial work. </p>
<div>
<div>But what is this ""<strong>Qualia</strong>"" business you might ask?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Qualia is a term most widely used in philosophy. In simple terms, it is a name for the feeling of a sensory experience. When you look at the color brown, it will be a different experience versus looking at the color turquoise. When you feel something coarse, it will differ from feeling something smooth. Qualia reminds us that no two lives are experienced the exact same way, but we are here togther, as artists, pushing physical extremes and testing boundaries with our mind and bodies. </div>

</div>
<h2><strong>What We Are Working On</strong></h2>
<p>Starting our fall season, we are developing new work titled, <strong>Phantom of Obsessions. </strong>Phantom of Obsessions explores the impulses that drive our obsessive desires. Each indivual indulges in some type of obession through their daily lives. Obessions come in many forms of rage, passion, tenderness, emptiness, power and stillness. The work will ride the wave of each impulse, creating texture, contrast and vulnerabilty. </p>
<p><em>Performers for this new work are:</em></p>
<h2>Arian Winn</h2>
<h2>Christina Nova Zych</h2>
<h2>Olivia Goldberg</h2>
<h2><strong>Jordan Saenz</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>Anne-Marie Talmadge</strong></h2>
<p><img alt=""QDT"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s19.postimage.org/eu5ocxdvn/jessewphoto_39_M.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>This new work will be an oppurtunity for us to really push ourselves in a new direction and grow as a company. <strong>We need your help</strong> to make this happen! We have a 'new works' show we are so proud to be a part of titled ""New Shoes"" presenting this October, with other upcoming artists, at <strong>Highways</strong> in Santa Monica. There are 5 dancers in this piece, each struggling to keep jobs that are flexible enough to move around for rehearsals and still pay the bills. All of us are putting our heart and souls into the art we create. </p>
<p>You can help us continue our path as artists. Help us rent studio space for rehearsals, pay dancers for their comitment, reimburse gas, hire a videographer, a lighting designer, pay for costumes and other finances that come along the way. We are hoping to perform this work at least 3 times in the next coming months to help put our name out there and create a buzz for our new work. </p>
</div>
<h2><strong>How Your Contribution Will Help</strong></h2>
<p>Your contribution however large or small will helping us reach our goal, your funds will support the following:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> It will fund <strong>studio space</strong> for 3 months worth of rehearsal.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> The design of <strong>costumes</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>4.</strong> The <strong>lighting designer. </strong>Lighting is the most crucial part to the experience of any dance work!</p>
<p><strong>5. Reimbursing for travel. </strong>Gas is expensive! Some dancers are traveling at least 40 miles to make this commitment!</p>
<p><strong>6. Artist Fee, </strong>includes paying dancers for their commitment during long rehearsal hours and dedication to the next 3 performances. </p>

<p><strong>THE HIVE</strong> is a visceral and darkly thrilling adaptation of Euripides’ Greek tragedy <em>Trojan Women </em>set within a beehive in the midst of colony collapse disorder.  In our production, Hecuba (protagonist of Trojan Women) is the Queen Bee with a buzzing Greek chorus!  We will use multiple medias to tell our story including dance, aerial, and video. </p>
<p>The hive set is a beehive jungle gym created from metal and wood designed by architect Dimitri Chatzipetros.  It is a collection of interconnected hexagonal cells each of which will be large enough to house an individual. The set fills the entire stage at Galapagos Art Space! (<a href=""http://www.galapagosartspace.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.galapagosartspace.com</a>)</p>
<p><strong>WHAT IS C.C.D.?</strong> C.C.D., sometimes known as honey bee depopulation syndrome (HBDS), is a phenomenon in which worker bees from a beehive abruptly disappear.  Colony collapse is economically significant because many agricultural crops worldwide are pollinated by bees.  It is estimated that one third of the human food supply depends on insect pollination, most of which is accomplished by bees.  In other words, if the bees disappear, eventually we will too.</p>
<p>The goal is to look at colony collapse disorder through the lens of war and the fall of great societies.  It is our hope that this production will not only entertain, but will also raise awareness regarding CCD.  We want to encourage a vision of our world that is interconnected and inter-specied.</p>
<p>We need help to make <strong>THE HIVE</strong> happen.<strong> When you help us, you also support local beekeeping!</strong> Contributors of $100.00 or more will recieve local organic honey products from <a href=""http://www.sunbeamcandles.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.sunbeamcandles.com/</a> and <a href=""http://www.weilfarms.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.weilfarms.com/</a></p>
<p><strong>ABOUT KATE VALENTINE</strong>: As a director, I have come to specialize in collaborating with performers on developing their original works. These artists include Whitney Biennial performance artist Julie Atlas Muz, Ed Hamell (winning the Herald Angel Award at the Edinburgh Festival 2007), and the World Famous *Bob* among others. My first effort as a feature filmmaker, <em>Rant and Roll</em>, was completed in spring 2008. As performer, I am best known for character-based comedy performances in the downtown NY scene, particularly the louche Austrian Mistress of Ceremonies character Miss Astrid.  As a producer, I am the creator of the seminal burlesque show The Va Va Voom Room (1997-2005). Besides having the first bicoastal burlesque show ever (running weekly in NYC and San Francisco), Miss Astrid and The Va Va Voom Room have performed all over Europe and the U.S. including the annual productions of The New York Burlesque Festival and The Burlesque Hall of Fame in Las Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>THE HIVE</strong> is an expansion of my goals as an artist.  I am excited to have received funding this year from the Brooklyn Arts Council to take my work in new and deeper directions. However, the funding has only gotten us 1/6 of what we need to present. </p>
<p>You can find clips of <strong>THE HIVE</strong> (regularly updated) and other work on my vimeo site:<a href=""http://www.vimeo.com/katevalentine"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><span style=""color: #0000ff;""><span lang=""EN"">www.vimeo.com/katevalentine</span></span></span></a> and blogspot <a href=""http://www.thehiveplay.blogspot.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.thehiveplay.blogspot.com</a></p>
<p> </p>
<strong>HOW WILL WE SPEND THE MONEY? </strong>Now we need the funds to finance the rest of our production. 
<p>PRE-PRODUCTION (aerial consultant/rigger/videographer/rehearsal space/fees/set designer:  $3200</p>
<p>SET (materials/transport/build/storage): $3500</p>
<p>PUBLICITY (advertisement materials/programs): $1000</p>
<p>PRODUCTION (cast/tech crew/costumes/props/performance space): $4400</p>
SUBTOTAL:  $12,100</div>
<div>less B.A.C. Grant: $2,100.00
<p><strong>TOTAL SOUGHT: $10,000.00</strong></p>
<h2>
<strong>PRODUCTION DATE: </strong><strong>October 24 &amp; 25, Galapagos </strong><strong>*Brooklyn, NYC</strong>
</h2>
<p>If we do not meet our financial goal, we will still present our show in a scaled down production.  If we gain more money, that’s more pay for our wonderful team of performers!  Our particpants include:</p>
<p>Dimitri Chatzipetros (set design), Taro Baugham (sound), David Quinn (costumes/sets), Matthew Mohr (additional choreography) Lianne Arnold (video) and performers Kate Valentine, Autum Kioti, Peekaboo Pointe, Robert C. Shryock, Francis Stallings and Ted Caine.</p>
<h3>CAN I HELP/PARTICIPATE IN OTHER WAYS?</h3>
<p><strong>YES! </strong>We will be offering a <strong>free matinee performance for students under 21</strong>.  If you would like your kids or your class to see <strong>THE HIVE </strong>for free please let us know!  (Recommended for 14 and up) Would like to volunteer to be a worker bee at <strong>THE HIVE?  </strong>We would happily take your assistance!</p>

We need help to make THE HIVE happen. When you help us, you also support local beekeeping! Contributors of $100.00 or more will recieve local organic honey products from http://www.sunbeamcandles.com/ and http://www.weilfarms.com/
ABOUT KATE VALENTINE: As a director, I have come to specialize in collaborating with performers on developing their original works. These artists include Whitney Biennial performance artist Julie Atlas Muz, Ed Hamell (winning the Herald Angel Award at the Edinburgh Festival 2007), and the World Famous *Bob* among others. My first effort as a feature filmmaker, Rant and Roll, was completed in spring 2008. As performer, I am best known for character-based comedy performances in the downtown NY scene, particularly the louche Austrian Mistress of Ceremonies character Miss Astrid.  As a producer, I am the creator of the seminal burlesque show The Va Va Voom Room (1997-2005). Besides having the first bicoastal burlesque show ever (running weekly in NYC and San Francisco), Miss Astrid and The Va Va Voom Room have performed all over Europe and the U.S. including the annual productions of The New York Burlesque Festival and The Burlesque Hall of Fame in Las Vegas.
THE HIVE is an expansion of my goals as an artist.  I am excited to have received funding this year from the Brooklyn Arts Council to take my work in new and deeper directions. However, the funding has only gotten us 1/6 of what we need to present. 
You can find clips of THE HIVE (regularly updated) and other work on my vimeo site:www.vimeo.com/katevalentine and blogspot www.thehiveplay.blogspot.com
 
HOW WILL WE SPEND THE MONEY? Now we need the funds to finance the rest of our production. 
PRE-PRODUCTION (aerial consultant/rigger/videographer/rehearsal space/fees/set designer:  $3200
SET (materials/transport/build/storage): $3500
PUBLICITY (advertisement materials/programs): $1000
PRODUCTION (cast/tech crew/costumes/props/performance space): $4400
SUBTOTAL:  $12,100
less B.A.C. Grant: $2,100.00
TOTAL SOUGHT: $10,000.00

PRODUCTION DATE: October 24 & 25, Galapagos *Brooklyn, NYC

If we do not meet our financial goal, we will still present our show in a scaled down production.  If we gain more money, that’s more pay for our wonderful team of performers!  Our particpants include:
Dimitri Chatzipetros (set design), Taro Baugham (sound), David Quinn (costumes/sets), Matthew Mohr (additional choreography) Lianne Arnold (video) and performers Kate Valentine, Autum Kioti, Peekaboo Pointe, Robert C. Shryock, Francis Stallings and Ted Caine.
CAN I HELP/PARTICIPATE IN OTHER WAYS?
YES! We will be offering a free matinee performance for students under 21.  If you would like your kids or your class to see THE HIVE for free please let us know!  (Recommended for 14 and up) Would like to volunteer to be a worker bee at THE HIVE?  We would happily take your assistance!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p><strong>OUR STORY</strong></p>
<p>(re)discover theatre is a Chicago based company that was formed at 2:00am on a January night with nothing but the realization that many artists spend their most foolhardy, energetic years observing, dreaming and waiting, and in that time waste great potential and opportunity. After spending all night rehearsing Shakespeare’s longest play in a freezing rehearsal room (that we were technically squatting in) we realized there was nowhere else we wanted to be and that we were done waiting.</p>
<p>Since that fateful January night we have stopped squatting, producing 3 full length shows, a fringe show, and a massive theatrically immersive event. We might be a little insane, but we’re so proud to have featured the work of over 50 phenomenal young artists taking risks like sword fighting two inches from the audience’s faces, ushering them through interactive checkpoints and rocking out to live music in church halls, theatres, backyards and basements. <strong>Our next production is a new play based on the Medea myth, written by ensemble member Jessica Shoemaker and directed by ensemble member Janet Howe.</strong> Jason and Medea isn’t your grandmother's formal greek tragedy.  Jessica and Janet are ripping the myth apart to explore things like sex, gender, love and power through a modern and timeless  context. Our risk this time?  <strong>We are going to do Jason and (Medea) for free.</strong> We are totally and completely depending on you to make this show happen. Because to be honest, despite our best efforts, we weren’t making any money on ticket sales anyway.  You tell us what you think this project is worth, and give accordingly.  Simple as that. </p>
<p><strong>THE IMPACT</strong></p>
<p>You don’t need to have a Ph.D in economics to know that times are hard for everyone.  Seeing theatre is a luxury many can’t afford, and theatres are struggling too.

(re)discover theatre is a Chicago based company that was formed at 2:00am on a January night with nothing but the realization that many artists spend their most foolhardy, energetic years observing, dreaming and waiting, and in that time waste great potential and opportunity. After spending all night rehearsing Shakespeare’s longest play in a freezing rehearsal room (that we were technically squatting in) we realized there was nowhere else we wanted to be and that we were done waiting.
Since that fateful January night we have stopped squatting, producing 3 full length shows, a fringe show, and a massive theatrically immersive event. We might be a little insane, but we’re so proud to have featured the work of over 50 phenomenal young artists taking risks like sword fighting two inches from the audience’s faces, ushering them through interactive checkpoints and rocking out to live music in church halls, theatres, backyards and basements. Our next production is a new play based on the Medea myth, written by ensemble member Jessica Shoemaker and directed by ensemble member Janet Howe. Jason and Medea isn’t your grandmother's formal greek tragedy.  Jessica and Janet are ripping the myth apart to explore things like sex, gender, love and power through a modern and timeless  context. Our risk this time?  We are going to do Jason and (Medea) for free. We are totally and completely depending on you to make this show happen. Because to be honest, despite our best efforts, we weren’t making any money on ticket sales anyway.  You tell us what you think this project is worth, and give accordingly.  Simple as that. 
THE IMPACT
You don’t need to have a Ph.D in economics to know that times are hard for everyone.  Seeing theatre is a luxury many can’t afford, and theatres are struggling too. We wanna see what happens when we flip that model, we want to explore new ways to share the art we love, the art we think is important, with as many people as possible.  
WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET
To produce this play we need $7,000. Your contribution will be funneled directly into virtually every aspect of this production. Costumes, props, live music, marketing materials, lights, and compensating our team of artists.  We want to use your money to make the art happen!

<p><em><strong>DEAR FRIENDS,</strong></em></p>
<p><span>We are in the process of creating a new interdisciplinary performance piece ""Rescued Memories: New York Stories"" which will premiere along with its companion piece ""The Escape"" November 8 &amp; 9 at the de Young Museum in San Francisco and in the Spring of 2014 in New York City. It is inspired by stories of women who sought refuge from human trafficking in the early 20th Century in New York City's Chinatown, shedding light on the experiences of women in the context of the struggles and achievements of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century Women’s Movement. The project will connect these experiences with today’s fabric of organizations listed below &amp; individuals that are on the front line of the contemporary struggle against the exploitation of women in our communities. </span></p>
<p><em><strong>YOU CAN BE PART OF THE TEAM!</strong></em></p>
<p>As part of this project, we will be flying 12 dancers, collaborating artists, and crew to New York City this July to take part in a week of film shoots in key historic locations within Manhattan Chinatown and to record music for the sound score of the piece. The site-specific video mapped and projected on various surfaces during the premiere performances plays a crucial part in the sharing of these stories.</p>
<p><em><strong>WE ARE TRYING TO RAISE $8,000 IN 30 DAYS AND WE NEED YOUR HELP! </strong></em></p>
<p>I am here to ask for your support in creating these projects as our scale and scope become larger and more integrated into various communities and major venues throughout the country. </p>
<p><em><strong>WE ARE IN CRITICAL NEED OF FUNDING</strong></em> to create this new interdisciplinary work in which dance, martial arts, multi-screen video projection, text &amp; music collide in a visual and aural landscape, a meditation on women being propelled into the unknown by courage and faith to risk their lives and everything they have for freedom.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><em><strong>WHY AM I DOING THIS?</strong></em></p>
<p>My hope is to share these stories in innovative ways providing insight into the experiences, challenges, and triumphs of the people in the various Chinese American communities over the years. What inherently has come with this process is the research and education and ultimately sharing with the audiences the issues of human trafficking and repercussions of the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act. </p>
<p>For both pieces I have done research and interviews at Donaldina Cameron House, Asian Women’s Shelter, Asian Pacific Islander Legal Outreach, Chinese Historical Society of America Museum, New York Asian Women’s Center, Asian/Pacific/American Institute at New York University, and Museum of Chinese in America.</p>
<p>I would like the stories to act as a catalyst for dialogue and sparking interest in understanding the deeper issues and providing a voice for those who could not share the challenges of their experiences. These stories can also serve as an avenue to rejoice in the courage, strength and resilience of the Chinese and Chinese Americans who built vibrant communities throughout the United States and pushed forth tremendous contributions to American Society.</p>

<p><em><strong>WHAT WE NEED</strong></em></p>

<p>I have been able to raise a portion of the money needed through individual donations, grants and sponsorships and have been working day in and day out to develop and plan this new project. We have hit a critical point and I am reaching out to you and the community for support.</p>
<p>The minimum we are trying to raise is $8,000 in 30 days to support the development of Phase 2 in New York City this July. This is cutting some corners, but will allow us to:</p>
<p>-       Pay for roundtrip airfare for 12 collaborating artists to fly to New York City for a week of film shoots in key historic locations and to do the music recording for the piece</p>
<p>-       Cover some of the artist fees for the dancers, musicians, filmmaker and cinematographers</p>
<p>If we exceed the goal and make our way to the $15,000 needed for Phase 2 of the project, you will be helping to:</p>
<p>-       Cover the costs the music recording engineer and recording space</p>
<p>-       Pay for the lighting and camera equipment rental</p>
<p>-       Cover the costs of renting a van to transport all the equipment and crew everyday</p>
<p>-       Pay for the remaining artist fees for the 12 collaborating artists</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We are a group of New Mexican playwrights. Our group is made up of national award winners, students &amp; artists of color. </p>
<p>We are planning to go to the 2012 NOPE Conference in Tempe, Arizona.</p>
<p><span>""The theme for the 2012 conference is “Re:Connecting -- Translocalities in Performance,” where we consider how the movements of peoples and ideas, metaphorically and literally in border-crossings of many kinds, have worked to shape the contemporary moment for theatre makers, producers, and audiences.""</span></p>
<p>We'd love for New Mexico to have a voice in this discussion. We need your help getting there!</p>
</div>
<div>

</div></div>","Our Story
We are a group of New Mexican playwrights. Our group is made up of national award winners, students & artists of color. 
We are planning to go to the 2012 NOPE Conference in Tempe, Arizona.
""The theme for the 2012 conference is “Re:Connecting -- Translocalities in Performance,” where we consider how the movements of peoples and ideas, metaphorically and literally in border-crossings of many kinds, have worked to shape the contemporary moment for theatre makers, producers, and audiences.""
We'd love for New Mexico to have a voice in this discussion. We need your help getting there!

<p><strong></strong>I am a Chicago-based choreographer and dance educator. I have been performing, choreographing, and teaching for over 15 years in Massachusetts, North Carolina, and now Chicago. This year I formed Salty Lark Dance, a company committed to socially relevant, artistically compelling dance theater.</p>
<p><strong>WHO WE ARE:<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Salty Lark Dance</strong> is a Chicago-based company established in 2012, performing original work by Artistic Director, <strong>Madeleine Reber</strong>. We draw from contemporary dance and dance theater traditions of lush physicality and the drama of the stage. Our work is motivated by a drive to embody internal questions and to respond to the world around us. Choreography serves as a medium through which to explore ideas (intellectual, physical, emotional), a place where contradictions may exist in unresolved complexity. Employing distinct movement vocabularies and dramatic imagery, Salty Lark Dance evokes the vulnerability and fallibility of human experience.</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT THE SHOW:<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Our production at the Minnesota Fringe Festival</strong> will include two works: <em>Collisions and Souvenirs</em> and <em>Lighthouse</em>.</p>
<p><em>Collisions and Souvenirs</em> was originally created through a 2012 DanceBridge grant from the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events. This work explores <em>awkwardness and distortion</em> with an interest in how these movement qualities fill expressive gaps left by strict social ideals of body presentation and appearance. Performers seem at times caught in their own inner dialogues, their struggles manifesting in urgent, idiosyncratic gestures. At other moments they seek connection through aggressive collisions and tender invitations. <em>Collisions and Souvenirs</em> explores metaphorical and literal manifestations of the awkward, vulnerable, imperfect moments of our humanness.</p>
<p><em>Lighthouse</em>, which I choreographed in 2009, deals with the juxtaposition of chaos and quiet (or storm and calm) – the tensions between voyaging and finding home, places of safety, places to which we return or look for familiar ground. Light, music and movement, together evoke a strangely familiar journey in a dream-like world. Thematically, this piece contemplates the comforts we seek in order to traverse difficult terrain, and examines what sustains us individually and collectively. The creation of this work is, in part, a personal response to habits of disconnection and aggressiveness that I perceive in our culture. How does larger social disconnection manifest in oneself, in community, even in political policy?</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is David Herrera and I am the artistic director of <strong>David Herrera Performance Company</strong> in San Francisco.  Our company is at the forefront of emerging dance/theater companies shaping the SF/Bay Area artistic landscape.  DHPCo is currently marking its 5th season through the creation of our newest work ""<strong><em>Slumber</em></strong>"". Slumber is a marriage of modern dance and theater which digs deep into cultural perspectives on Death and Living.  Inspired by Dia de los Muertos celebrations and the Greek Orpheus myth, Slumber is a transcendent journey in which Death and Life meet and interact.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have gathered a phenomenal team of artist and collaborators for this unique program: 1 Theatrical director, 7 dancers, 1 actress, 5 designers, and myself as choreographer/artistic director.  For the past 8 months these artists have been working hard and efficiently to bring to life a concept larger than any one of us, a concept that both challenges us and hopefully leaves an imprint on our audience.  At the moment our funds only afford us rehearsal space and down payment on our theater rental; thus we still need financial assistance to give our artists a fair living wage. We are requesting your assistance to help us bring  ""Slumber"" to fruition.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>To make a dance theater production takes hundreds of hours of manpower: training, rehearsing, taking classes, building sets, composing an original musical score, technical and electrical work, constructing costumes; in short, physical and intellectual labor which shouldn't go unacknowledged or unpaid. Your help will directly support a member of our team in the creation of this project.  Each perk you see to your right is named in honor of each of our performers and our theatrical director. </p>

<p>        </p>
<p>For my undergraduate senior thesis at Purchase College, I am adapting and directing <em>A Children's Tragedy</em>, a performance experiment based on Frank Wedekind's <em>Spring Awakening</em>, the 1890 play that has served as a poetic critique on youth, education, and humanity for the past 123 years. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In collaboration with my fellow seniors Jacob Louchheim and Madeline Moss, along with a passionate force of actors and designers from the Theatre Design/Technology and Theatre &amp; Performance programs at Purchase College, I have worked extensively in classes and rehearsals to turn a simple idea into a living, breathing piece of work. My intent is not only to satisfy the requirements of the Theatre &amp; Performance Directing concentration, but also to truly experience the collaborative, creative, and intellectual challenges that theatre offers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As with any major project, production costs are inevitable and in order that we achieve the most dynamic set and costume construction possible we ask for a kind donation that will help us raise $600 for this project. In an effort to thank you for your contributions, we have several rewards that will deepen your connection with all of those involved in creating this piece. I am incredibly grateful for this opportunity and hope to see you at the show!</p>

For my undergraduate senior thesis at Purchase College, I am adapting and directing A Children's Tragedy, a performance experiment based on Frank Wedekind's Spring Awakening, the 1890 play that has served as a poetic critique on youth, education, and humanity for the past 123 years. 
 
In collaboration with my fellow seniors Jacob Louchheim and Madeline Moss, along with a passionate force of actors and designers from the Theatre Design/Technology and Theatre & Performance programs at Purchase College, I have worked extensively in classes and rehearsals to turn a simple idea into a living, breathing piece of work. My intent is not only to satisfy the requirements of the Theatre & Performance Directing concentration, but also to truly experience the collaborative, creative, and intellectual challenges that theatre offers.
 
As with any major project, production costs are inevitable and in order that we achieve the most dynamic set and costume construction possible we ask for a kind donation that will help us raise $600 for this project. In an effort to thank you for your contributions, we have several rewards that will deepen your connection with all of those involved in creating this piece. I am incredibly grateful for this opportunity and hope to see you at the show!
 
Thank you for your graciousness,
 
Sincerely,
 
Dena Kopolovich

<p><strong>The Share Shakespeare Project by Arden Kelly </strong></p>
<p>Hi, I am Arden Kelly, a teaching artist in the performing arts in NYC.  I am a graduate of Juilliard and have been a professional actress/singer/dancer for many years.  </p>
<p>The Share Shakespeare Project’s goal is to teach students and teachers Shakespeare in The Philippines, and document the experience in a short film.  Recently, I have been on a journey to find my voice - what I have to say as an artist.  I came up with this project because of inspiration from my students to whom I introduced the story and text of Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet. </p>
<p>This incredible project will allow me to introduce these students and teachers to the text, poetry and images Shakespeare conjures up for the first time in their lives and from a performing arts point of view.  With your help, I can bring joy and encourage imagination into the lives of these students and teachers, who otherwise may not have a creative outlet available to them.</p>
<p>The pledge goal of $2700.00 will be used in the following ways: $1800.00 for transportation, $550.00 for camera equipment and editing, $150.00 for teaching materials and supplies, and $200.00 to host a viewing party! </p>
<p>As a contributor, you may receive one or all of the following perks: a mini-tutorial (this is a video where you learn about iambic-pentameter), sneak-peak footage of a class, an email video thank you from a student or teacher in my class or workshop, enjoy the launch party in NYC!</p>
<p>Whatever funds are raised will be used! Extra funds can and will be used to provide the students with materials such as books and other learning materials and further online lessons for the teachers and students.</p>
<p>Art changes people for the better. This is why I am an artist! I believe it makes people think about their actions and therefore, learn compassion.  Art inspires people to help others and shed light on those in the dark.  Your donation shines light on these students, so they can help their family, community, and their world.  You can help the teachers incorporate Shakespeare into their curriculum and therefore inspire students for many generations to come!</p>
<p>For those of you who know me, you know the passion I have for life is matched in my passion for performing and teaching!  For those who are not familiar with my work, I give 100% of my ability, creativity and effort in everything I do. </p>
<p>Let me express my gratitude for you’re even taking the time to view and read about this project!  Thank you. </p>

<p> There are only two characters in our musical.</p>
<p>A man: a japanese rising painter, and a woman: a half-Japanese half American actress who moved from Japan to NY.  The two meet when they are seated next to each other on the plane to NY. It was a meeting that filled the hole of the woman’s broken heart. They sympathize with each other as two human beings, and love each other as a woman and a man.</p>
<p>However, the woman was a lesbian. Unsure why she suddenly fell in love with the other sex, the woman starts living with the man in her own apartment in NY.</p>
<p>In the limited time of 90 days that their visas allow them, the two touch each other, start to love, hesitate, meet walls, crash, care for each other, and learn to lean against one another. They explore an unexpected world of their own.<span>　</span> After the three months are over – they meet an unchangable ending.</p>

<p> In order to participate in the festival, we will create our work in NY with our actress who currently lives there.</p>
<p>Four of our company members: director (playwright), actor (composer) , Stage manager,and lighting technician<span>、</span>will fly to NY, stay for one month(Stage manager and Lighting technician-only 10days), hire studios for rehearsals, and pay the theater usage fee for participation.</p>
<p>At the lowest estimate, we need $20,000. We would like to ask you to help us raise $10,000 out of the $20,000 that is needed.</p>
<p> Whatever the story, audiences should step into the dream, be intoxicated by the beauty, and forget about time when watching a musical. In order to create such a time that colors life, money is needed as much as talent, love, and hard work.</p>
<p>Although musicals are popular in Japan, most of them are translations of Broadway or West End pieces, and are produced on a commercial basis. We, a director/playwright and composer/actor, have stepped forward to create a musical that can match the world. Participating in MITF is a big chance for us. We believe that this summer’s success will lead us to a new stage as musical creators.</p>

<p>A musical is a composite art that is born with the cooperation of many artists. In order to produce such a creative company, we have named our own production team, ‘Theatre Polyphonic’. When artists luckily meet up and start to create, it is very difficult to cover the costs with only ticket income. However, lack of subsidy for theatrical arts is a growing problem not only in Japan, but all around the world. We have continued to create without subsidy, just by using our love and time. </p>
<p>On March 11th 2011, a large earthquake hit Japan and took the precious lives of many people. This experience made many artists wonder: what can we do in the field of ‘art’? Who am I? With the fear of the nuclear accident now in our daily lives, we are living in a new time that can never return to what it was before that fateful day. Many artists in Japan have stood still for a whaile, to think about the power and meaning of art. Now they are beginning to step forward once again. It must be that people have started to realize how much ‘art’ is necessary in our lives in many ways. It is amazing how music, stories, and laughter can save people and heal their wounds.</p>
<p>As for myself, I stopped all activities of Theatre Polyphonic in 2011 and produced some charity shows. After one year, I started to create just as before, with a new feeling in mind; with artists who changed for the better after the incident. My new days of expression have begun.</p>
<p>This summer, we will leap across the ocean with our own original musical, in order to show the world what we have.From Japan, to the city of musicals… to our dream, New York. We cannot leap only with love and time. Please lend us a hand to leap over this very tall wall.</p>

Theatre Polyphonic　
A theatrical art is a composite art that is born with the cooperation of many artists. In order to produce such a creative company, We have named our own production team, ‘Theatre Polyphonic’. In order to resonate, to interact.
-Archives　“ The Book of Devil”　by Kenichi Tani　Directed Sachiko Ishimaru (October,2010)　
　Performed at wedding banquet “Three Sisters”　by A.Chekhov  Directed by Sachiko Ishimaru (July,2012)　　Musical “Peer Gynt”　by H.Ibsen Directed by Sachiko Ishimaru　Composed by Yasuhiro Ito(December,2012)
　“The Woman in Tennessee Williams”　by Tennessee Williams  Directed by Sachiko Ishimaru (March,2012)　　Official Web Site

 
About ""Color of Life""　　
 There are only two characters in our musical.
A man: a japanese rising painter, and a woman: a half-Japanese half American actress who moved from Japan to NY.  The two meet when they are seated next to each other on the plane to NY. It was a meeting that filled the hole of the woman’s broken heart. They sympathize with each other as two human beings, and love each other as a woman and a man.
However, the woman was a lesbian. Unsure why she suddenly fell in love with the other sex, the woman starts living with the man in her own apartment in NY.
In the limited time of 90 days that their visas allow them, the two touch each other, start to love, hesitate, meet walls, crash, care for each other, and learn to lean against one another. They explore an unexpected world of their own.　 After the three months are over – they meet an unchangable ending.
　""Color of Life"" Official Web Site
What We Need & What You Get　
 In order to participate in the festival, we will create our work in NY with our actress who currently lives there.
Four of our company members: director (playwright), actor (composer) , Stage manager,and lighting technician、will fly to NY, stay for one month(Stage manager and Lighting technician-only 10days), hire studios for rehearsals, and pay the theater usage fee for participation.
At the lowest estimate, we need $20,000. We would like to ask you to help us raise $10,000 out of the $20,000 that is needed.
 Whatever the story, audiences should step into the dream, be intoxicated by the beauty, and forget about time when watching a musical. In order to create such a time that colors life, money is needed as much as talent, love, and hard work.
Although musicals are popular in Japan, most of them are translations of Broadway or West End pieces, and are produced on a commercial basis. We, a director/playwright and composer/actor, have stepped forward to create a musical that can match the world. Participating in MITF is a big chance for us. We believe that this summer’s success will lead us to a new stage as musical creators.
The Impact　　
A musical is a composite art that is born with the cooperation of many artists. In order to produce such a creative company, we have named our own production team, ‘Theatre Polyphonic’. When artists luckily meet up and start to create, it is very difficult to cover the costs with only ticket income. However, lack of subsidy for theatrical arts is a growing problem not only in Japan, but all around the world. We have continued to create without subsidy, just by using our love and time. 
On March 11th 2011, a large earthquake hit Japan and took the precious lives of many people. This experience made many artists wonder: what can we do in the field of ‘art’? Who am I? With the fear of the nuclear accident now in our daily lives, we are living in a new time that can never return to what it was before that fateful day. Many artists in Japan have stood still for a whaile, to think about the power and meaning of art. Now they are beginning to step forward once again. It must be that people have started to realize how much ‘art’ is necessary in our lives in many ways. It is amazing how music, stories, and laughter can save people and heal their wounds.
As for myself, I stopped all activities of Theatre Polyphonic in 2011 and produced some charity shows. After one year, I started to create just as before, with a new feeling in mind; with artists who changed for the better after the incident. My new days of expression have begun.
This summer, we will leap across the ocean with our own original musical, in order to show the world what we have.From Japan, to the city of musicals… to our dream, New York. We cannot leap only with love and time. Please lend us a hand to leap over this very tall wall.

Who is LiveWire Chicago?

LiveWire Chicago is a collective of artists who produce original contemporary voices of American theatre in Chicago. We have come a long way from our humble beginnings as Visiting Artists at the Side Project to producing downtown at the Chicago DCA Storefront Theater and establishing our unique annual short play festival, VisionFest, now in its fourth year.

LiveWire began our current 6th season in the fall with the Chicago premiere of A Bright New Boise by 2011 Obie Award-winning playwright, Samuel D. Hunter. We are excited to continue this season with the Chicago premiere of Oohrah! by Bekah Brunstetter at
Steppenwolf Theatre's Garage Rep as part of their 2012 season devoted to the
theme ""Dispatches from the Homefront.""

Oohrah! is the comedic tale of a soldier's
homecoming gone awry. More info about our production at Steppenwolf can be found here.

<h3><strong>We're going to tell you a story....</strong></h3>
<p>It's a history story.... But, LISTEN... You don't have to read all of this if you don't want to. Just pick your reward from the menu over there to the right and click on one of those pink <strong>""CLAIM THIS PERK&gt;""</strong> buttons. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!</p>
<p>But hey, if you're still interested in our story, here it goes:</p>
<h3><strong>ONCE UPON A TIME, there were Bunnies…</strong></h3>
<p>One summer not too long ago, a brand-spanking-new play opened at a modest 40-seat theater in Hollywood: an eight-character romantic comedy that was funny, smart, and entertaining.  Like most such productions, the original run was attended by friends and family of the cast, plus a few enterprising theatre-goers entranced by the title, or the postcard, or both…</p>
<p>But then reviews started rolling in… and they were really GOOD! Thus a hit was born. When we thought the play had run its course, we announced a closing date and threw a blow-out closing night party…. only to wake up the next morning to an answering machine full of requests for reservations.  We reopened, and kept going, and going, and going… Big, fancy producers came calling, talking about a New York run and a national tour… but could the play just be rewritten a bit… to cut out a few characters… or maybe make it a one-act… or, actually, could you maybe turn it into a one-person show, with puppets…?  And after much due deliberation, we decided, that no, we actually really liked the play the way it was: an eight-character romantic comedy that was funny, smart, and entertaining.  </p>
<p>And so the bunnies rode quietly off into the sunset… UNTIL NOW.</p>
<p>A few years have passed and while all of us have gone on do to many other shows, this is the one everyone still asks about…. Not only that, but there’s now an entire generation (in Los Angeles, a few years constitutes a generation) of new people who haven’t even heard of the show… or rather, haven’t heard of it yet…</p>
<p>AND SO… we are very pleased to announce the triumphant return of Fluffy Bunnies in a Field of Daisies… with a <strong>BRAND NEW CAST</strong> of <em>incredibly</em> talented performers…. I mean <em>UNBELIEVABLY</em> talented... seriously, you should see them, they're <em>amazing</em>... Opening JUNE 7, 2012 at the historic Arena Stage in Hollywood... which just happens to be 10 years TO THE DAY of the original opening.   Fancy.</p>
<h3><strong>...BUT... here's the deal... </strong></h3>
<p>Putting on good quality live theater is EXPENSIVE... even doing almost all of the work - from building and painting the set to running the box office to handing out postcards to the tourists right there on Hollywood boulevard - ourselves, our costs will still run well north of $20,000... now there are some clever ways to reduce costs... and our producer is a hell of a negotiator... but at the end of the day, even after saving our pennies to make this dream come true, we are still dependent on the support of people like you to make this work.</p>
<p>In order to do this right, we want to tell EVERYONE about this show... and to do that, we've done some VERY precise calculations and determined that we need to raise an <em>additional</em> $5624 by June 1 to cover our marketing and publicity expenses.</p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>Fluffy Bunnies In A Field of Daisies runs from June 7 - July 28, 2012, at The Arena Stage @ Theater of Arts in Hollywood. With less than a month until opening, we need to raise some funds to kick us off with a bang!</p>
<p>While $5624 isn't a huge budget to promote a show in Los Angeles - especially in this neighborhood (we're across the street from Cirque du Soleil's IRIS at Hollywood &amp; Highland), it represents a HUGE sum for us... and we are exceptionally good at doing a lot with very little. YOUR GENEROUS DONATION can make the difference between an entertaining show performed for a smattering of those forutnate few who stumble upon us, and a MONSTER HIT SHOW, playing to packed houses of amazed theater-goers, doubled over with laughter and weeping with tears of joy.</p>
<p>But to make that happen, we need your help. Please click one of the <strong>""CLAIM THIS PERK&gt;""</strong> buttons now!</p>
<p>We are deeply grateful for anything you can donate, but, hey, it's not all about us... WE want to reward YOU for helping bring this amazing show to the world. Some donation levels include an actual ticket to see the play... which YOU were probably seriously considering doing anyway... For our supporters from out of town, we have signed postcards or posters or even genuine official FLUFFY BUNNIES t-shirts for you. Of course, ALL of our donors will receive our everlasting gratitute.</p>
<h3><strong>Wait... you're STILL reading...? What...? </strong></h3>
<p>Oh... What's the show about, you ask....?  Well... </p>
<h3>
<strong>Fluffy Bunnies in a Field of Daisies</strong> is an upbeat comedy of sexual politics, exploring meeting, getting fixed up, and dating, as a group of friends undertakes minute investigations and categorizing of their experiences. The result is a happy interaction of stories, sophisticated on-target writing, and impeccable comic acting with perfect timing. It's audience tested yet fresh as a daisy. Throw in a full-cast dance number and the bonus that there's actually a message <strong style=""font-size: 10px;"">– </strong>something about consideration and finally getting real <strong style=""font-size: 10px;"">– </strong>and Fluffy Bunnies is ready to rock this town.</h3>

<p><b>What is Knitting Pattern?</b></p>
<p>Inspired by an old book of knitting instructions,
Deborah Nash has written a new play that explores patterns – those we live, and
those we knit. On a lonely mountain top, Three Fates make, measure and cut
yarn, click-clacking the shapes of other people’s lives – until their knitting
is interrupted by the arrival of the enigmatic Purl. See <i>Knitting Pattern </i>at the inaugural Words Over Waltham Forest
Festival at Walthamstow Central Library (16<sup>th</sup> November, 11am and
2pm) and Leytonstone Library (22<sup>nd</sup> November, 4.30 and 6.00pm).</p>
<p><b>Project History &amp; Creative Team</b></p>
<p><i>Knitting Pattern </i>was presented as a staged
reading in March 2013 as part of Goldsmiths Plays new writing series at
Goldsmiths, University of London. Despite the staged reading format, we
approached the text through movement and objects (including giant knitting
needles!) from the beginning. <i>Knitting
Pattern </i>is directed by <a href=""http://www.beckamcfadden.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Becka McFadden</a> with movement direction by
<a href=""http://scheherazaad.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Scheherazaad Cooper</a> and performed by Alexandra Draghici, Barbora Hanusova, <a href=""http://laraparmiani.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lara Parmiani</a> and Eliza Soroga. Design by Karen Mayor. We are an international team of
performance and cross-arts practitioners hailing from six different countries.
Goldsmiths was our primary common denominator – until we all learned how to
knit together! </p>
<p><b>Impact</b></p>
<p>Our WOWF performances will be provided free of
charge to the community. It’s our hope that they will stimulate a discussion about
the role of knitting in the lives of individuals and groups. This has already
begun through Deborah’s on-going research and meetings with local North London
knitters, whose stories have already found their way into the play. After our
November performances, we’ll be pursuing opportunities to present our work in
textile museums, gallery and theatres across the UK and Europe.</p>
<p><b>Where do you come in?</b></p>
<p>Funds raised will cover expenses related to costume
design and construction, which are new (knitted!) elements for this production.
While this project is a labour of love for us all, we also believe in fair
payment for artists. Funds raised will allow us to cover travel expenses and basic
honorariums. All donors will be entered in a prize draw to win a bespoke
knitted scarf in the colour of their choice. If you’d like to support us with a
donation of knitting talent and make an item for the show, please do get in
touch.</p>

A BIG HISTORY
In 1958 the Theater's stage was inaugurated with a play written by Alekos Sakellarios, titled ""The 6th American Fleet"".
Until 1967 it housed various artists and repertories. From 1971
to 1974 during the same difficult years that Greece was taken over by a
dictatorship regime, they turned the Theater into a place of political
activism, and a coordinating meeting ground for artistic and political action
against the dictators. All this action culminated in the events of the Polytechneio

<h2>Final Savage Land </h2>
<p>Final Savage Land is the most recent full-length installation/performance work created by Toronto based company <strong>Sore for Punching You - Artistic Director, Allison Cummings</strong></p>
<p>The piece premiered in January 2013 at Oz Studios in Toronto and was met with much excitement and critical acclaim. Yay! Our hard work up to that point certainly seemed to have paid off.</p>
<p>The piece is a macabre yet humourous look at survival through co-dependancy and explores the complicated relationship between the simultaneous brutality and beauty of nature.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of press quotes!</p>
<p><span><em>""I was never quite sure what was going to happen but I was excited to get to be there for it.""</em> -Mooney on Theatre</span></p>
<p><span><span><em>""the proceedings are wrapped in layers of metaphor and control""</em> - NOW magazine</span></span></p>
<p>Shortly after our run, we were approached by the Summerworks festival and invited to be presented as an off-site piece. What a great opportunity to be able to ride the wave and remount the work so closely after its premiere!</p>
<p>Being included in this popular festival will open up the show to a broader audience, giving it the chance to be seen by some peeps who may be able to help expand the life. This is a rare thing in hybrid performance work and an opportunity we cannot refuse! Another great perk to this is that because of limited seating in the first run, many a would be patron were not able to see the show....now, they can. Whoop!</p>
<h3>Why we need to raise funds</h3>
<p>Here's the deal with why we need to campaign.</p>
<p>SummerWorks has generously offered to provide some crucial elements for this remount, such as the cost of the space and front of house during the festival.</p>
<p>BUT, right at the moment, there are no Artist fees in place. The collaborators working on this project are absolutely hands-down exceptional. They have poured everything  into the making of this piece and need to be compensated appropriately.</p>
<p>The performing team is</p>
<p><strong>Luke Garwood</strong> - Dancer/Performer</p>
<p><strong>Linnea Swan</strong> - Dancer/Performer</p>
<p><strong>Lyon Smith</strong> - Live Composition</p>
<p><strong>Gabriel Cropley</strong> - Production Design / Live Lighting</p>
<p>-with the addition of <strong>Jolyane Langlois</strong> as Stage Manager/assistant and general all round go to gal for this production as I, <strong>Allison</strong> <strong>Cummings</strong>, will be giving birth around the same time as the festival. Eiyiyi.</p>
<p>All funds from this campaign raised will go directly to the above Artists. All other costs regarding the production such as publicity, bbq'd ducks etc. will be covered by hopeful box office intake.</p>
<h3>If you choose to help us, you will be impacting the project in the following ways.</h3>
<p>-You will be making a statement of the importance of hard-working talented artists being  properly compensated for their thoughts, skills and time.</p>
<p>-You will be supporting the work of Sore for Punching You, allowing the company to make progess towards a larger audience and potential longevity for this particular work.</p>
<p>-You will be saying YES to independant theatre production!</p>
<p>-You will be helping make sure these talented artists are paying their rent doing what they were put on this earth to do.</p>

</div></div>","Final Savage Land 
Final Savage Land is the most recent full-length installation/performance work created by Toronto based company Sore for Punching You - Artistic Director, Allison Cummings
The piece premiered in January 2013 at Oz Studios in Toronto and was met with much excitement and critical acclaim. Yay! Our hard work up to that point certainly seemed to have paid off.
The piece is a macabre yet humourous look at survival through co-dependancy and explores the complicated relationship between the simultaneous brutality and beauty of nature.
Here are a couple of press quotes!
""I was never quite sure what was going to happen but I was excited to get to be there for it."" -Mooney on Theatre
""the proceedings are wrapped in layers of metaphor and control"" - NOW magazine
Shortly after our run, we were approached by the Summerworks festival and invited to be presented as an off-site piece. What a great opportunity to be able to ride the wave and remount the work so closely after its premiere!
Being included in this popular festival will open up the show to a broader audience, giving it the chance to be seen by some peeps who may be able to help expand the life. This is a rare thing in hybrid performance work and an opportunity we cannot refuse! Another great perk to this is that because of limited seating in the first run, many a would be patron were not able to see the show....now, they can. Whoop!
Why we need to raise funds
Here's the deal with why we need to campaign.
SummerWorks has generously offered to provide some crucial elements for this remount, such as the cost of the space and front of house during the festival.
BUT, right at the moment, there are no Artist fees in place. The collaborators working on this project are absolutely hands-down exceptional. They have poured everything  into the making of this piece and need to be compensated appropriately.
The performing team is
Luke Garwood - Dancer/Performer
Linnea Swan - Dancer/Performer
Lyon Smith - Live Composition
Gabriel Cropley - Production Design / Live Lighting
-with the addition of Jolyane Langlois as Stage Manager/assistant and general all round go to gal for this production as I, Allison Cummings, will be giving birth around the same time as the festival. Eiyiyi.
All funds from this campaign raised will go directly to the above Artists. All other costs regarding the production such as publicity, bbq'd ducks etc. will be covered by hopeful box office intake.
If you choose to help us, you will be impacting the project in the following ways.
-You will be making a statement of the importance of hard-working talented artists being  properly compensated for their thoughts, skills and time.
-You will be supporting the work of Sore for Punching You, allowing the company to make progess towards a larger audience and potential longevity for this particular work.
-You will be saying YES to independant theatre production!
-You will be helping make sure these talented artists are paying their rent doing what they were put on this earth to do.

<p>I’ve had numerous conversations with family and friends who either live with schizophrenia or share lives with those who do. It is clear that there is a need to examine and share these stories. Recently, a friend whose father is living with schizophrenia sent me this message:</p>
<p><i>""I had to commit my dad to a hospital again last Tuesday. Your piece and your experience with your brother helped rekindle a perspective and inspiration that I think I had lost.

<p>I'm Katie Watkins. I've been a theatre artist in Portland, OR, since 2011, creating, performing, directing, and helping to produce theatre and contemporary performance. For years, I have been unable to shake this particular story from my mind and body. I watched my little brother go through this as a child while I was a child myself. I never gave myself the time or space to really process what happened to him. This show is the culmination of over two years of work. I'm so thrilled to finally share it. </p>

<h4>Dear Friends, Family, and Supporters of Sylvani, <br/>
</h4>
</strong></h3><p><strong style=""color: #660099;""></strong></p><p><span style=""color: #660099;"">Sylvani is so grateful for all your ongoing support, and some of you are now clicking on this campaign after receiving an update from me. <br/></span></p><p><span style=""color: #660099;"">We have been truly touched by the way Sylvani has been supported to continue her training for a career in dance, as this is very expensive training I simply cannot afford to fully provide on my own. With your help, we are a community raising a touching and beautiful dancer who truly gives her soul on the stage, and wants to use dance to share her message with the world. </span></p><p><span style=""color: #660099;"">Thank you! </span></p><p>Last year, you helped send Sylvani to Joffrey Ballet, where she hopes to dance professionally one day. It was an incredible experience for her to dance in the Joffrey Tower, meet the Artistic Director, be in Chicago, and really be immersed in the caliber of dance that she not only aspires to, but that they apparently believe she has a chance at achieving!  </p><p>This year, at age 17, she has decided, very wisely and maturely, rather than return immediately to Joffrey--though she did audition and was accepted in a very competitive process--it would be better for her to develop her skill more finely tuned in the smaller program at Oregon Ballet Theater. OBT is just a couple hours from our home, in Portland, OR, and is an up and coming excellent company with an Artistic Director who loves to take pre-professional students and bring them up through the ranks into the company!  Sylvani learned, in OBT's top level last summer for a short 2-week intensive, that if she dances there for 4-6 weeks, she will be considered for OBT2, the second company that is often called on to dance with the main company in their larger productions, as well as having their own performance schedule! Sylvani feels that, with the smaller class size and more personal attention from truly excellent faculty, all of them also professional top dancers from OBT and around the world, and also the fact that she is placed in their highest level already, with company members at the barre alongside her taking class, THIS is the place to get that high level personal attention to truly ""finish"" her so that she can return to Joffrey in a year and really be ready for them! </p><p>You have contributed to Sylvani in the past, and we ask you once again, please Help Sylvani Dance--this time to Oregon Ballet Theater, where she is nearly at the point of being that professional dancer she has always dreamed of, and where she will get the last things she needs to launch to Joffrey when she is 18! </p><h4>Here is the link to her new campaign: <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/help-sylvani-dance-towards-her-future/x/421042#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b>Help Sylvani Dance Towards Her Future!</b></a>

<p></p></div>","Dear Friends, Family, and Supporters of Sylvani, 

Sylvani is so grateful for all your ongoing support, and some of you are now clicking on this campaign after receiving an update from me. We have been truly touched by the way Sylvani has been supported to continue her training for a career in dance, as this is very expensive training I simply cannot afford to fully provide on my own. With your help, we are a community raising a touching and beautiful dancer who truly gives her soul on the stage, and wants to use dance to share her message with the world. Thank you! Last year, you helped send Sylvani to Joffrey Ballet, where she hopes to dance professionally one day. It was an incredible experience for her to dance in the Joffrey Tower, meet the Artistic Director, be in Chicago, and really be immersed in the caliber of dance that she not only aspires to, but that they apparently believe she has a chance at achieving!  This year, at age 17, she has decided, very wisely and maturely, rather than return immediately to Joffrey--though she did audition and was accepted in a very competitive process--it would be better for her to develop her skill more finely tuned in the smaller program at Oregon Ballet Theater. OBT is just a couple hours from our home, in Portland, OR, and is an up and coming excellent company with an Artistic Director who loves to take pre-professional students and bring them up through the ranks into the company!  Sylvani learned, in OBT's top level last summer for a short 2-week intensive, that if she dances there for 4-6 weeks, she will be considered for OBT2, the second company that is often called on to dance with the main company in their larger productions, as well as having their own performance schedule! Sylvani feels that, with the smaller class size and more personal attention from truly excellent faculty, all of them also professional top dancers from OBT and around the world, and also the fact that she is placed in their highest level already, with company members at the barre alongside her taking class, THIS is the place to get that high level personal attention to truly ""finish"" her so that she can return to Joffrey in a year and really be ready for them! You have contributed to Sylvani in the past, and we ask you once again, please Help Sylvani Dance--this time to Oregon Ballet Theater, where she is nearly at the point of being that professional dancer she has always dreamed of, and where she will get the last things she needs to launch to Joffrey when she is 18! Here is the link to her new campaign: Help Sylvani Dance Towards Her Future!
Above All, Sylvani is a Dancer...and she Dreams

""Dancer"" -- It's simply who she is. Sylvani is always dancing. When Sylvani is onstage, something flows out of her that is so true, so intrinsically ""her"", that people watching catch her spark, and can't take their eyes off her. People who don't even know her have come up to her after a performance to tell her that SHE is what they come to ballet for-her energy, her passion, and yes, her transparent beauty. Whether it's classical ballet, comical, theatrical, or especially contemporary, when Sylvani dances, she gives herself to you.   ""If someone asks you “where does the universe end?” it goes on forever. Dancing is the same thing. Dancing is very cosmic. People pray by dancing in some religions. For me, dancing is my religion. It’s needed for life.  It’s not that I wouldn’t survive without it, it’s that I couldn’t live without it. "" -Sylvani                      Dreaming of Dancing All Summer...The Synopsis:Sylvani has auditioned for, and been accepted to, several summer ballet intensives designed for young aspiring pre-professional dancers. After careful consideration, Sylvani has chosen Texas Ballet Theater's 5-week intensive as her next important step. TBT has offered her a 90% tuition scholarship! That is so rare for girls, as ballet's scholarships are often saved for boys. This indicates that the program's Principal, Ms. Kathryn Warakomsky, believes in Sylvani's potential. But even with 90% of the tuition covered, there are still many expenses, including Room and Board, travel from Eugene, Oregon to Dallas/Ft. Worth, additional fees, several pairs of pointe shoes, etc. We have very limited means, and Sylvani needs your help to fulfill her dream!We are asking you to help us reach our goal of $4200, which would Help Sylvani Dance!                                                                                        Ladies and Gentlemen, the Full Ballet...
What is the Dream?
Where did it Come From?
What is an Intensive?
Why is it Important?
Why Texas Ballet Theater?
What can You Do?

What will Sylvani Give back?.

Please, read on...Our Story:Dreams DO come true!When Sylvani was 3, she saw ""The Nutcracker"" and dreamed of being the Sugar Plum Fairy.  Her grandma (a dancer herself) and grandpa said they'd pay for ballet lessons...they didn't know what they were getting into!  So many little girls start ballet lessons with big dreams of wearing tutus and being a ballerina...and then move on to other things.                               For a few, though, the dance goes on...Sylvani has never waivered. She has trained at one of the top academies in Eugene, OR, for 11 years--now she's nearly 15 years old and dances most days, up to 20 hours, every week, after school and on weekends. We don't push her...SHE pushes US! And this past holiday season, her first dance dream came true...Sylvani was one of three in a triple cast in her ballet studio's production of ""The Nutcracker"" to dance the Sugar Plum Fairy!        Dreaming Bigger!There is so much farther to go! Sylvani's dream is to have a ballet career, and many people who know the dance world have told her she has that potential. She's been told she has ""it""--a special combination of dance talent and ability, musicality, stage presence, work ethic, passion, even her beautiful Romanian look. She wants to make a difference, have a voice. She comes from a deep place of thinking about her world. Sylvani has much to say to the world through dance.                                    The Biggest Dream of AllWhen she was 6, Sylvani announced that she was going to be a professional ballet dancer. She has grown a long way since that conversation, through aching muscles, blistered toes, long hours, and ""costume malfunctions"", and once in awhile, I ask her if she still wants this. She says ""of course"". ""If you love something so much, you want to be able to share it. Being a professional provides the opportunity to share it with as many people as possible. They always say not to bring your outside drama into a performance, but that’s not completely true. You can harness your feelings onstage and that’s what makes a performer truly wonderful to watch. What an intensive can do is teach you how to get the technique down and into your memory as natural movements. To be a professional means you have these techniques down, so you can then show your emotions instead of worrying about your technique.  The technique of ballet isn’t natural movements...but we want to be able to push the limits, and that opens you up to any movement you feel.""  --SylvaniPre-professional Training-Summer IntensiveTraining to be a professional dancer is all year long. There is no summer ""off"". Sylvani gets her foundation in her home studio here in Eugene, with her primary teachers. But there is always something else competing--school, homework, family obligations, friends who she wants to spend time with, but who don't dance. Summer intensives are essential. Each summer, many ballet companies and top training programs around the world offer 2-6 week intensives for serious students wishing to improve their form, round out their training, and maybe find their way into a company one day. This really is necessary in today's world, if you wish to go professional. It is not a ""summer camp"", but important training. Students who attend these gain so much from taking class all day, every day, for several weeks with other serious ballet students. They are exposed to other ballet styles, other types of training, gain physical strength, learn their limits and how to push through them, make contacts in the dance world that can last a lifetime, get seen by professionals who can help them later, and get a rare opportunity to just spend time with others who live, eat, and breathe--DANCE!!!""You get more exposure, you get more technique, the more practice you get--more teachers, more time in the studio. Summer intensives are unique because everyone in the world is different and everyone can teach you different things--not just technique, which is important, but also sharing their personal stories of what they used, what emotions they harnessed"" --SylvaniAudition tours are held all over the country, with often over a thousand students auditioning for each intensive--and maybe a tenth chosen in this selective process. This year, Sylvani auditioned for Texas Ballet Theater, Boston Ballet Theatre, Oregon Ballet Theatre, and Whitman Summer Dance Lab at in-person auditions. We also created a video audition for Joffrey Ballet Company, as we could not make it to a live audition, and Sylvani dreams of dancing with Joffrey one day. Sylvani was accepted to every one of the intensives she auditioned for and offered partial scholarships to three of them! Where She's Been--Whitman Summer Dance Lab--and YOU took her there!For the past two years, Sylvani has attended Whitman Summer Dance Lab in Walla Walla, WA. This has been a wonderful experience for her! She gained so much, the faculty coming from all over, and with many dance styles, she was exposed to many methods of teaching, and many new people in the dance world. Sylvani came back more confident, stronger, and much improved in her level of technique and maturity as a dancer.She was honored to be chosen by audition for an ""extra"" apprenticeship with ODC Dance of San Francisco a professional modern dance company the directors of SDL brought in for their end of summer Walla Walla Dance Festival! ODC chose 10 of the SDL students to have a new work choreographed on them, which they performed in the festival alongside three professional companies.Sylvani's experiences at Summer Dance Lab the past two summers have been wonderful. She gained new dance experience, made lifelong connections in the dance world, and found herself not only capable of dancing 8 hours a day, every day, but LOVING it! Summer Dance Lab loved her, too...and has offered her a merit tuition scholarship if she returns, but Sylvani feels it's time to branch out and see what other intensives have to offer. Next Dance Step? Texas Ballet Theater!The decision process has been difficult..After much consideration, Sylvani has chosen Texas Ballet Theater, where she feels she will get lots of personal attention, and which is so highly recommended by her teacher here, for her next step. She feels this is exactly what she needs at this point in her training. Texas Ballet Theater Dallas, has been led by Artistic Director, Ben Stevenson since 2003, after he brought Houston Ballet to international renown in the 80's and 90's. Kathryn Warakomsky TBT's School and Summer Program Principal, and Li Anlin, TBT's Assistant Artistic Director, both former Principals with Houston Ballet, have taught Sylvani as guest faculty here at ballet academy. Both are excellent teachers and Sylvani looks forward to learning more from them. She hopes to take class with Ben Stevenson, who teaches the upper levels. All the faculty are or have been dancers, often principals, with TBT or Houston Ballet, or both. Sylvani's primary teacher recommends TBT's program for it's training. Texas Ballet Theater first offered Sylvani a 50% tuition merit scholarship! It is rare for scholarships to be offered to girls, as they are usually reserved for boys to try to increase the balance of male dancers. Then Ms. Warakomsky, learning of our financial challenges, offered another 40% off tuition! A total of 90% tuition scholarship!!! That is like saying to her ""We believe you have potential""!What Got Her to This ""Pointe""?Two years ago, we came to you, our community of friends, family, and performing artists. Sylvani was 12, and had just been accepted to her very first summer intensives. We needed help and you ALL pooled your resources with ours and together, we got her to Summer Dance Lab for their two-week intensive!See the story and remind yourself how great you were by checking out ""Help Sylvani Dance""  here.                             Because you were so active, contributing and sharing Sylvani's campaign, you also helped an ""'angel"" sponsor find Sylvani...who gave her the rest of what she needed that year, covered her return to Whitman Summer Dance Lab for their 5-week program last year,  and helped with many other expenses we've had for her!We don't know what we would have done without him, and more...he has become a friend, though we've never met in person. We exchanged many emails, and he was always very encouraging, telling us his family's story of hardship, loss, and then great fortune. He believes in family and wanted to ""pay it forward"" to help others with dreams who couldn't make it on their own resources.But something has happened...It has been nearly 4 months since we have heard from him. We are very worried...it is not like him to simply stop communicating, as he has many times expressed that he would never ""let a kid down"". We are afraid something must have happened to him, and he is in our prayers and thoughts every day.  So, in addition to great worry and care about him, we also must quickly raise the funds for her to go to her intensive.Sylvani needs you!Our Biggest Challenge...$$$Sylvani has the attention of TBT.  They are offering her a 90% tuition scholarship, but her dream still hangs in the balance...there are still significant costs for room and board, travel, and dance shoes/clothing she will need for dancing all day every day for 5 weeks. My job as a full-time enrollment services/financial aid advisor at our local community college barely supports our family, and two of our family members have disabling conditions with high medical costs I also manage. Sylvani's older sister is in college, on full scholarship, but there are ways I support her as well. Sylvani's grandparents, my wonderful mom and dad, love ballet and dance of all forms, and have paid for Sylvani's year-round ballet lessons. They will continue to do so, but cannot do more, as my father is hoping to retire in a few years (he is 75). Sylvani has worked so hard to achieve her dream and shows so much promise! Dance is the most important thing in her life. I don't want to see her miss this chance because I am unable to afford it. So, we are turning to you, our friends and family, patrons of dance and the performing arts, and supporters of dreams of all kinds!The Goal=$4200All money contributed will go towards Sylvani's needs this summer. Though the actual costs add up to over $4470, we have set our goal lower to make it easier to reach. 
Remaining tuition = $195(after $975 merit scholarship and $780 additional aid)
Room and Board = $2200
Staff/Activities Fee=$275
Airfare = $800 (I take Sylvani there, she flies back alone. If we raise more, her dad and I could go see the performance at the end and bring her back)
Car rental =$200
Airbnb room= $200 (for two days prior to beginning of program, check-in day, and a day for me to help her get settled)
4-5 pairs of pointe shoes ($60-90 each), 4-5 new leotards ($25-40 each), 5 pairs of tights ($20 each) = $600 or more
There will be so many incidental expenses, and if we reach more than our goal, it will be put in a dedicated fund for later dance costs. All will go to Sylvani's dance education! (If we don't meet the goal, all money contributed will go to smaller programs closer to home)What You Get...So Much Gratitude!Think how wonderful you will feel when you see Sylvani onstage one day and you helped her get there! 
                                      And Sylvani offers a bit of herself back to you! Any contribution is a ""Step in her Dance"", so she and we are grateful for any help you can give.  If 850 of our Facebook friends give Sylvani $5 each, she's on her way!  And you receive a personalized ""Thank you!"" on Facebook and a smile that lasts all week!If you contribute $15-$29, Sylvani will write you a beautiful ""Thank you"" card by hand, expressing how much this means to her.When Sylvani danced for her godfather and godmother's wedding, their photographer, Roots, took this beautiful photo of her. Sylvani's Uncle Lawrence, a graphic designer, made it into an 11""x17"" poster. (Printing services donated by Premier Press, in Portland, OR). This perk was one of the favorites from Sylvani's campaign two years ago, and we have a limited edition of only 58 of these left! If you contribute $30-$49, Sylvani will send you one of these signed by her...a future star!When Sylvani danced in ""The Nutcracker"" this past fall, we were allowed to take the costume for a photo shoot with Tiffany Grey of Mamalove Photography. Tiffany has a special connection with Sylvani, and got so many beautiful shots! If you contribute $50-$99, Sylvani will send your choice of one of these beautiful photos signed by her! You can see all of them on her ""gallery"" page.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               One of the things Sylvani is very good at, and has received training in, is choreography...she would love to choreograph something just for you!  Two years ago, after she came back from her first Summer Dance Lab intensive, Sylvani choreographed this to say ""Thank You!"" for all the contributors from the Oregon Country Fair..she performed this at ""The Midnight Show""--imagine what she might choreograph for you after this summer at Texas Ballet Theater!If you contribute $100 or more, Sylvani will choreograph for you...1 minute for $100 (well, a minute and a half), 2 minutes for $200, 3 minutes for $300, 4 minutes for $400, and 5 minutes for $500!  You choose the style...the music. We will video it for you, and send you either a Youtube link or a DVD!  For this perk, Sylvani will want to wait until after her intensive, so she has all the training you helped provide...so these will begin in August. The Impact- Making a Dancer! Sylvani has so much to give the world...and YOUR voice can be part of that. Sylvani's dream, like anyone's needs nurturing to grow into a reality.  Even a small contribution can add up like individual steps--hundreds of them--make a dance, and eventually an entire ballet!                                                                            Other Ways You Can HelpWe know there may not be money in your pocket right now. We ask that you consider just $5 to help Sylvani--because truly, if every one of our friends and family contributed just $5, she would have all she needs!  But if you simply cannot right now, there are other ways you can be part of the ""Help Sylvani Dance"" team, and we will appreciate it so much!A campaign like this is only as good as it's sharing--Let's make Sylvani go viral!Share with EVERYONE you can think of--and Share OFTEN!!!  If you use the sharing tools at the top of the page, once a day, letting everyone know how much you support Sylvani, that will really help!  Indiegogo uses it's ""GoGo Factor"" to determine who gets to be on the home page, and at the top of the searches for different categories. That is how Sylvani's ""angel sponsor"" found her and that impacted a whole year!Airfare Frequent Flyer Miles:If you don't have money, but you DO have frequent flyer miles you could donate, please let us know here on the ""Comments"" section. We need round-trip tickets to get Sylvani there and back, and to get me there and back at the beginning to settle her in.  Even better would be if we had two more round-trip tickets for her Daddy and I to be able to go at the end and see the performance she will do! We have a special perk for donated air miles--a DVD of the final showcase performance plus a signed photograph! Thank you. --Sylvani and Fiora",25.0,2,"13 Campaigns

</p><p>My name is
Mariel Mitton and I am a Senior, Dance Performance major at the University of
South Carolina. I have been accepted into the LINES Ballet summer program in
San Francisco, California, which will take place this summer, July thru August.
The program is for 5 weeks at the LINES Ballet facility and dancers train
approximately 9 hours a day, with classes in a variety of styles including
ballet, modern, pointe, improvisation, Gyrotonics, and LINES Ballet repertoire.
 </p>
<p>Attending the
LINES Ballet summer program has been a dream of mine since I was 11 years old
when I was first introduced to the LINES Ballet repertoire. Now 10 years later
I am determined to make this dream a reality. This program is not just like any
other, it will push me farther to my potential and will give me opportunities to
network and connect with dancers and faculty from all over the country. This
prestigious program is connected to the professional ballet company, LINES
Ballet, which is recognized as one of the leading contemporary ballet companies
in the world. I feel honored to have been accepted and I am thrilled to take on
this next adventure in my life!</p>
<p>
</p><h2>Fundraising
Goal:  $2,500</h2>
<p>Tuition:         $2,500</p><p>I am raising money to pay for the tuition thru this campaign, but there are also the costs of travel and living to consider (approximately $2,000). For these other expenses I will be doing other forms of fundraising. The total expense of living in San Francisco and attending the program will be at least $4,500 total.</p>
<h3>What am I doing
to financially support myself?</h3>
<p>As a full time
student I pick up as many shifts as my schedule allows working as a server, and
during the months of May and June I will be starting two more part time jobs. </p>
<p>The expense of
this program is too great for my family to support me, but I am venturing out
on my own and need some help getting started. I have supported myself during
college thru dance and academic scholarships and doing part time work as a
server, and teaching dance. After paying for tuition and rent, my paychecks go towards my food and pointe shoes. I live pretty frugally; anything leftover goes directly into my
savings to help for my dance career. </p>
<p>After my
acceptance into the program I was unfortunately denied any financial aid
assistance. As soon as my friends heard of this they immediately began to plan
multiple fundraisers such as selling flowers before spring dance recitals, a yard
sale, and a bake sale. We are going to go thru with these other fundraisers,
which will go towards the living and traveling expenses (approximately $2,000). I feel so blessed to
have such supportive friends who know just how much attending this program
means to me, and who gave me the courage to ask for help.</p><p><br/></p>
<p>
</p><h3>Why this program
means so much to me:</h3>
<p>Two of the
critical components of being a dancer are technique and artistry. I have been
training for 14 years to refine my technique, but now I need to find my own
sense of self as an artist. The program at LINES Ballet has a different
approach to dance, which provides a safe environment that encourages artistic
risk-taking and independent thinking. One of the hardest parts about being a
dancer is that there are a million of us out there. I need to discover what
makes me unique and what I can contribute to the dance world. There are
numerous technically proficient dancers in the world, but we need more dancers
who are intelligent and able to articulate the importance of this art form. At
the LINES Ballet summer program I will become stronger not only as a dancer,
but more knowledgeable and fulfilled as a human being.</p>
<p></p><p></p>Exposing myself to various art forms and people has always been very important to me because I believe that it helps shape who I am as a person and as an artist. When I was 18 years old I broadened my scope as a dancer by learning ballroom dance styles and began teaching adults private lessons. As I worked with individual adults who had various motives for learning how to dance, I watched as they not only overcame their fears and insecurities of movement but also dealt with issues in their lives that had nothing to do with dance. These experiences reminded me that dance is able to reach everyone and influence all people; dance has the ability to break down barriers and limitations and set you free. My hope is to continue to discover myself as an artist so that I can help others do the same.<br/><p></p></div>","My name is

This trip has inspired me to always pursue my dreams because they can lead you to extraordinary places.

In the entertainment world, networking is everything.
Over the last four years we have sharpened our abilities and skills in order to excel in our craft. With our acting toolboxes stocked, we are ready to start our journeys in the professional world.
In order to gain mobility, it is imperative for us to make connections with established professionals in the entertainment industry. So, we are raising money to bring Casting Directors and Agents from New York, Los Angeles, and elsewhere to Elon University!
All money will go towards necessary accommodations for the professionals including:
· Airfare

Cumulatively, it costs about $2000 per professional we decide to bring to Elon.
We will take classes and work intimately with these people, as well as perform our showcase material for them, providing us an invaluable experience.

<h3>What IS Sitting Regal by the Window?<br/>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>(For show dates click below!)<br/><a href=""http://planetconnections.org/2015-full-productions/sitting-regal-by-the-window/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://planetconnections.org/2015-full-productions/sitting-regal-by-the-window/</a><br/>Sitting Regal is a one-woman cabaret show with a storyline rooted in my upbringing as an Egyptian American in DC and New York City. When I was a little girl my father lived abroad and my mother lived in various bird labs where she worked two full time jobs as an adjunct professor and researcher. I spent a lot of time with people other than my parents. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431303599/damu8nbxn8gx1bvg97a1.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Much of my time was spent between Chelsea's two public housing projects. In the summer I'd visit my immigrant family in the Muslim community of Germantown, Philadelphia. Growing up I spent much of my childhood with kids who unknowingly lived on society's margins. It was only as we grew older, that these margins became painfully clear. I watched as our experiences in the world turned from shared to incommensurable. </p>
<p>I had the privilege of stepping into and out of the spaces that shaped me without having to experience the consequences those spaces conferred on people who couldn't walk away. </p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431300258/dzqxsivzuzbx49g9px8p.png"" src="""" style=""""/>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In Sitting Regal I use cabaret to step inside the experiences
and personalities of the people that shaped me. Sitting Regal is a lively, fun spoof of a child's idiosyncratic identity. I use song, dance and comedy to
revive the ridiculous narratives I grew up between. But within this celebration
is a deep sadness. Writing Sitting Regal helped me confront the confusion I had
felt in losing friends to prisons and systemic cruelty. </p>
<p></p>It is our responsibility to bear witness. How can our personal experiences inform us to become better allies? What do we see when we leave our homes to become part of this city's feverish fabric? What will we do about it? <br/><br/>I want this project to include your voice.<br/><br/>Where is your window and what do you see?</div><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431300855/eylvew3wptdnjgviwopn.png"" src="""" style=""""/><div>

</div></div>","What IS Sitting Regal by the Window?


(For show dates click below!)http://planetconnections.org/2015-full-productions/sitting-regal-by-the-window/Sitting Regal is a one-woman cabaret show with a storyline rooted in my upbringing as an Egyptian American in DC and New York City. When I was a little girl my father lived abroad and my mother lived in various bird labs where she worked two full time jobs as an adjunct professor and researcher. I spent a lot of time with people other than my parents. 




Much of my time was spent between Chelsea's two public housing projects. In the summer I'd visit my immigrant family in the Muslim community of Germantown, Philadelphia. Growing up I spent much of my childhood with kids who unknowingly lived on society's margins. It was only as we grew older, that these margins became painfully clear. I watched as our experiences in the world turned from shared to incommensurable. 
I had the privilege of stepping into and out of the spaces that shaped me without having to experience the consequences those spaces conferred on people who couldn't walk away. 



In Sitting Regal I use cabaret to step inside the experiences
and personalities of the people that shaped me. Sitting Regal is a lively, fun spoof of a child's idiosyncratic identity. I use song, dance and comedy to
revive the ridiculous narratives I grew up between. But within this celebration
is a deep sadness. Writing Sitting Regal helped me confront the confusion I had
felt in losing friends to prisons and systemic cruelty. 
It is our responsibility to bear witness. How can our personal experiences inform us to become better allies? What do we see when we leave our homes to become part of this city's feverish fabric? What will we do about it? I want this project to include your voice.Where is your window and what do you see?
Help me bring Sitting Regal to two NYC theater festivals this summer! Here's what it'll take:


$10,000 will cover the full cost of what it will take to put on five shows for Planet Connections in June and July and five to seven shows for the Fringe Festival in August. I need your help to make sure I am covering costs and fairly compensating my talented and dedicated collaborators.Fringe Festival NYC entrance fee $700
Planet Connections Theater Festivity entrance fee $240
Plane ticket and board for Marc Ernest, musical arranger $1000
Set design materials $200
Set designer (two festivals) $400
 Lighting designer stipend (two festivals) $400
Sound operator stipend (two festivals) $200
Costume and body mic $160

My partner in this project, Marc Ernest, is a Lebanese jazz pianist based in Beirut, he is credited as the musical arranger of this show because he took my songs and ran with them. He is a musical genius and without him I'd be nowhere.

<p><u>About The Ume Group</u></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.theumegroup.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Ume Group</a> is a New York - based dance / physical theatre ensemble dedicated to sharing traditions and developing new work. We believe that a good performance artist is constantly learning, creating, teaching, and performing. We work in physical disciplines ranging from butoh dance, gymnastics, yoga and martial arts to ceíli dance, clowning and commedia. We are hailed by critics for our “commanding, physically impressive performances” (The Village Voice) and “risky physical vulnerability.” (nytheatre.com). Our work has engaged audiences across the US, from Hollywood to Brooklyn. In 2015, The Ume Group celebrated our Five Year Anniversary at The Irondale Center in Brooklyn. In 2016, The Ume Group launched our first company-wide Social Action Projects- a series of street performances inspired by the individual activism of ensemble members.</p>

Have you ever been betrayed?

              Screwed over by a friend, a boss, a lover?  

                         Do you wait for ""karma"" to get them? 

NO! You want revenge. NOW. 


Even if you're DEAD.



              

GHOST LIGHT - a recipe for revenge





Take one part Japan's most famous ghost story --
       Add a handful of ambitious New York actors, 
                                 Toss in a soupçon of Macbethian plot twists,

                                          Pour all into Manhattan's most notorious haunted apartment,
        Shake well, and watch it bubble!



Written by award winning playwright, Carol Fisher Sorgenfrei. 


Produced and Directed by EMMY winner Penny Bergman.


Co-conceived by Penny Bergman and Carol Fisher Sorgenfrei.







YOTSUYA GHOST TALES, the kabuki (classical Japanese theater) play based on the legend of a horribly betrayed woman named Oiwa, was our first inspiration.  A perennial favorite in Japan, it has been adapted into at least 30 films and continues to influence anime and Japanese horror movies. 



MACBETH, one of Shakespeare's greatest plays, has some surprising parallels to YOTSUYA KAIDAN. Like Oiwa's faithless husband, Macbeth is seduced into evil by unbridled ambition and tormented by the ghosts of those he murdered. The supernatural is everywhere...

GHOST LIGHT fuses elements of these masterpieces to create a completely original spine-tingling, brilliantly theatrical new work. 

   

Funded by generous grants from the UCLA Academic Senate Council on Research and the Terasaki Center for Japanese Studies, we completed Phase 1: REFINE THE SCRIPT through a series of staged readings in New York and Los Angeles. Now we need your help to fund Phase 2: an EQUITY SHOWCASE PRODUCTION in NY.





          



Our Original Story

The year is 2010. Japanese-American actress, Keiko (Kay) Tamiya, descendant of the original Oiwa, gives birth to a baby girl AND wins a Primetime Emmy all on the same day. Her husband and co-star, Bryan Eamon Quinn, also nominated, loses out to his arch rival.  Kay and Bryan are riding high as America's favorite couple with an unbreakable contract binding them together --- love, devotion, partners at home and at work ...
When both are offered the leads in MACBETH on Broadway, Bryan's thrill at playing the role of a lifetime is dashed by Keiko's disgust at the director's concept for Lady Macbeth: a stereotypical, derogatory depiction of Asian women. Keiko rejects the job and wants Bryan to stand in solidarity and give up his plum part as well.  


What ambitious actor wouldn't kill to play Macbeth???        







The Collaboration
Although La Luna's Penny Bergman (Producing Artistic Director and Emmy winner) and Carol Fisher Sorgenfrei (prize-winning playwright) have each presented international hybrid pieces in venues around the world, this is their first collaboration.

Honoring Tradition: Our Journey to
Oiwa's ShrineTokyo 2014

Carol and Penny traveled to Oiwa's grave to
offer her flowers, incense and a lovely note (in English and Japanese). We humbly requested her permission and blessing to present her story, our way.  
This
ancient Japanese ritual insures all is safe and secure on stage and on set. Those
who neglect it risk suffering the wrath of Oiwa's ghost.  (Yet another
connection to Shakespeare: the infamous ""curse of the Scottish
play."")

Long ago, in a time, far, far away, when magic was science and science was magic (which was science [which was magic]), William had a problem.  He was a snowman.
A dark comedy read by its author, Catfish Baruni, and presented in the ultimate timeless medium: the slideshow.  Adult-type language and topics will be present (and magical [which is scientific]).
   First Tucson, Now San Diego 

Slideshow Fairytales was first presented at the 2013 Tucson Fringe Festival.  It was such a hit that everyone told William that he needed to hit the road and play the myriad Vaudeville theaters that dotted this fine country. Sadly, William discovered that Vaudeville died about 90 years ago and was about to give up his dreams when someone told him about the awesome San Diego Fringe Festival! He applied and was accepted, and then swore vengeance against the talkies (for killing vaudeville.)
But now, since William doesn't have a job (thanks, Obamacare), your generous help is needed to get him down San Diego way!  Here are the costs:  $40 - application fee $675 - venue fee
$125 - insurance
$360 - travel fees
$500 - housing
$200 - props
$400 - marketing (postcards and posters)
$200 - emergency fund (flat tires) and reward costs 
Total: $2,500

If we're unable to raise the entire amount, we will first pay for the venue and insurance. William's gonna have to sleep on the beach.  Catfish is going to have to find a wealthy octogenarian and try to seduce her (it's not going to work [thanks, Obamacare].)

    The Impact Have you ever had a dream, the kind from which you don't wake up screaming?  It was pretty great, wasn't it?  Don't you wish you could go back to that magical dream world and stay there forever?  Well, tough luck, pal, you can't incept yourself!
...BUT you can help Catfish's dream come true, and what could be more rewarding than that (and a mug)?   Risks & Challenges Obviously the biggest challenge Catfish and William face is a silent audience.  Fortunately, Catfish is well versed in dealing with crowds who don't find him to be particularly funny (thanks, Obamacare!)  
Should this fish and his snowman fail to get laughs they will resort to:  Stripping

<h3>Who Are We...</h3>
<p>EGM Productions was founded by Emily Gillmor Murphy. The sole company mission is to produce new plays and we need your support to get our debut production off the ground. Monster? is a brave, honest and wild new play and we have assembled a world class team to bring it from the page to the stage.

We’ve put together some fantastic perks, and hope they will encourage you to support the production. We will be hugely grateful for any help you can give.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact Your Donation Will Have...</h3>
<p>We have been honoured to assemble this incredible team of artists who all have excellent track records in their own rights with theatrical projects such as this and with your support, we know we can bring a beautiful and unforgettable production to the Irish stage. Our hope is that our run in Theatre Upstairs is the seed and that Monster? will continue to grow and run for years to come. There is a saying at Theatre Upstairs... No Root. No Fruit. We need your support to create and nurture the roots of this theatrical gem that we hope will flourish long into the future.</p>

<h3>CASTLEREIGH THEATRE PROJECT</h3>
<p>Castlereigh Theatre Project is a documentary theatre company based in Victoria, BC. Founded in 2007 by playwrights Francesca Albright and Jude Thaddeus Allen, the company creates verbatim-style plays that explore the relationship between artistic expression and the nature of true events: fact-based plays built on real-life accounts and storytelling that explore both current and universal themes.</p>
<h3>GOD'S LAKE</h3>
<p>Inspired by the mysterious death of a young Cree woman, God’s Lake is an original work of documentary theatre that address the issue of safety for young Indigenous women and girls living on isolated First Nation reserves. This production will stage the lived experiences of people from the fly-in community of God’s Lake Narrows, Manitoba. The play uses the words of real people, verbatim from interviews conducted over six months in 2017. God’s Lake is a collaboration between playwright Francesca Albright and award-winning filmmaker Kevin Lee Burton. Directed by Atomic Vaudeville’s Britt Small.</p>
<h3>DEVELOPMENT and PRODUCTION </h3>
<p>Castlereigh is asking for your support for the crucial <strong>second phase</strong> of development.</p>
<p><u>PHASE ONE </u>(completed): 6 months of research, interviews and writing by co-creators Francesca Albright and Kevin Lee Burton.  This phase is supported by the CRD Arts Development, BC Arts Council and the Banff Centre for the Arts.</p>
<p><strong><u>PHASE TWO</u> (in progress): Auditions, re-writes, rehearsal, and initial workshop production at the Metro Studio Theatre in Victoria BC January 4-6, 2018. Dramaturgy by Gordon Pengilly, direction by Britt Small, production design by James Insell, lighting design by RJ Peters.  The cast features Indigenous performers from BC and Manitoba: Nick Benz, Nyla Carpentier, Taran Kootenhayoo, Frances Koncan and Erica Wilson. This phase is partially funded through the CRD and the BCAC but requires additional support from the community.</strong></p>
<p><u>PHASE THREE </u>(developing): National touring and production.  We are currently in discussions with 2 major Canadian companies about presentation in 2018/19 .  We are committed to the longevity of this work and outreach to both small and large communities across Canada to maximize the potential impact of these under-served and often neglected voices.  This phase will be supported through guarantees from partner/presenter companies and we are currently seeking further support from the Canada Council for the Arts.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>YOUR SUPPORT</h3>
<p>We need to raise $10,000 to complete the second phase of this incredible project! Funds will go specifically towards the artist fees for the rehearsal process and the initial workshop production.</p>
<ul>
<li>for $25 we will personally thank you in the program</li>
<li>for $100 you will receive a thank you and 2 tickets to the workshop production in January</li>
<li>for $250 you will receive a thank you, 2 tickets and a meet and great with the artists</li>

</div><div>
<h3>HISTORY and IMPACT</h3>
<p><strong>Castlereigh</strong> has produced works <i>Castle in the Sky</i>, <i>The Dublin Play </i>(workshop production) and <i>Ocean Fox. Castle In The Sky</i> was workshopped in Victoria, 2011, and given a staged reading at Intrepid Theatre’s You Show. This was followed by the festival premiere of the play at Sage Theatre’s Ignite Festival and a subsequent provincial tour, including Medicine Hat. In April 2016, the play received its professional premiere over a week-long run at the Belfry Theatre Studio. Directed by Britt Small (Atomic Vaudeville) the play was well-received and reviewed.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Lee Burton </strong>(Swampy Cree) is an award-winning director. His experimental film Nikamowin (Song) received the Best Experimental and Best Indigenous Language Production awards at the ImagineNATIVE Film + Media Arts Festival in Toronto and went on to be named as part of the Toronto International Film Festival Group’s Top 10 list. Kevin has worked with the National Film Board of Canada; creating his short documentary film, Writing the Land, and co-creating Gods Lake Narrows Interactive which won a Webby award. Kevin was listed as Canada’s Top 20 to watch by the Victoria Film Festival in 2008. Kevin has worked as program assistant for the Native and Indigenous Initiative at the Sundance Institute in Beverly Hills, California. He is also a founding member of the ITWĒ and Mamaweyas Collectives. Trained at an all-Aboriginal training Program (Indigenous Independent Digital Filmmaking Program) in North Vancouver, British Columbia, Kevin has been carving a niche in working with his ancestral language, Cree. Kevin is originally from God's Lake Narrows First Nation in Manitoba, Canada.</p>
<p>This play, <strong>God's Lake,</strong> is a rare window into a First Nation community that is an essential and original part of the fabric of our Canadian story. <strong>God's Lake </strong>will shine a light on their lived experiences and amplify their voices. It is our intention through the sharing of this work to increase understanding and encourage dialogue.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>CHALLENGES</h3>
<p>Although we have received some municipal and provincial funding, public arts funders increasingly expect that arts organizations reach out to the private sector and individuals to contribute to project funding.  Also, public granting is a highly competitive field with demand greatly outweighing the arts budgets. Your support in many ways is the key to successful arts projects, especially for theatre which is born in community and comes to completion in community.</p>
<p><i>""The purpose of theatre is... making an event in which a group of fragments are suddenly brought together... in a community which, by the natural laws that make every community, gradually breaks up... At certain moments this fragmented world comes together and for a certain time it can rediscover the marvel of organic life ... The marvel of being one.""</i> - Peter Brook</p>

Trained at an all-Aboriginal training Program (Indigenous Independent Digital Filmmaking Program) in North Vancouver, British Columbia, Kevin has been carving a niche in working with his ancestral language, Cree. Kevin is originally from God's Lake Narrows First Nation in Manitoba, Canada.
This play, God's Lake, is a rare window into a First Nation community that is an essential and original part of the fabric of our Canadian story. God's Lake will shine a light on their lived experiences and amplify their voices. It is our intention through the sharing of this work to increase understanding and encourage dialogue.

CHALLENGES
Although we have received some municipal and provincial funding, public arts funders increasingly expect that arts organizations reach out to the private sector and individuals to contribute to project funding.  Also, public granting is a highly competitive field with demand greatly outweighing the arts budgets. Your support in many ways is the key to successful arts projects, especially for theatre which is born in community and comes to completion in community.
""The purpose of theatre is... making an event in which a group of fragments are suddenly brought together... in a community which, by the natural laws that make every community, gradually breaks up... At certain moments this fragmented world comes together and for a certain time it can rediscover the marvel of organic life ... The marvel of being one."" - Peter Brook
