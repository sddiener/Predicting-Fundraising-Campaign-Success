Has your inner soul ever be touched
by an original piece of music performed by an unknown musical artist? If it
has, did you ever ask yourself ….“How it is possible that such talent and
creativity is not shared with the rest of mankind”? 
The answer is actually quite simple.
It takes more than talent to complete this magical transformation process. 
There are countless musicians and
composers with dreams of sharing their love of music but don’t have the means or
opportunity to transform their dreams into reality.
Gathering The Music (GTM) has
created an environment where talented musicians and composes can come together
to mold their concepts and ideas into unique pieces of musical art to be shared
with a worldwide listening audience.
Verse:
We are enabling “Music Makers” to
realize their dreams by providing a musical environment where our core values
of “Transparency and Collaboration” form the cohesive elements in our musical
family.
GTM provides the Management and
Technical expertise required to record and produce original music in parallel
with a creative marketing strategy and an effective launching campaign. 
Bridge: 
Our focus is on the music without
restrictions to a limited number of Genres. Whether this music is Blues, Jazz,
Rock, Soul, Funk or even Blue Grass among others we are enthusiastic about
getting the best possible quality results out there for listeners to enjoy.
Chorus:
Fortunately our musical family
includes a number of accomplished musicians awarded recognition in The
Netherlands as Best Blues Guitarist, Best Rock Guitarist and Best Guitarist.
We are on the verge of releasing our
first album.
Our GTM organization has been self-
funded. This means we have been covering our expenses from personal savings and
cash scraped together without subsidies from government funded organizations. 
Due to the limited funding available
we are not able to provide musicians with financial support during their dream
development process. Most of them struggle to earn enough to cover their living
expenses without the luxury of saving for the future or building up a pension. 
We are at a cross-road and are
asking you for funding help so we can continue our momentum, build on our
strengths and give the needed financial support to our musical family as they
concentrate on their passion for music and fulfilling their dreams.
 Conclusion:
Within the next six months we expect
to begin to reap the benefits of our efforts and will be self-supporting in
helping “Music Makers” realize their dreams.
Even if you are not in a position to
help us with the funding there are other ways to show you support.
Get familiar with our work and
spread the word…..to your family, friends and colleagues who enjoy the magic in
the music.
Your support will go a long way
toward having a new generation of “Music Makers” dreams come true.

b) take it one syllable at a time and you'll be just fine 
c) It's Greek so get all mediterranean (meh-dee-teh-rrráy-knee-un) on it     
""I Can't Really Afford To Help Out Right Now, Can I Still Help?""
 if money is tight at the moment but you like what you've heard send me an email and i'll make sure you get a digital copy 
even if you can't afford to help out financially - a bit of sharing / weightlessvangelising goes a really long way .. if you have friends or family who you think may enjoy the album send them this way  : ]

<p><strong>Who we are</strong><br/><br/>Lucidity Chamberistas was formed by Eugene Takahashi in the fall of 2014 in Queens, New York with fellow professional musicians. The word “lucidity” in our name is a play on the sound of Long Island City, where the orchestra had its inaugural performance. The inaugural performance at the Secret Theatre in Long Island City was aired on the WQXR.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>Our goal and strategies</strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to deliver live classical music to wider audiences in Queens and beyond. We play not only standard repertoires but also works by living composers from our local communities. We have unique strategies in maintaining professional quality of music making and accessibility to the community. <br/> </p>
<p>We strive to turn <u>all</u> of our concerts <u>FREE</u><strong> </strong>so that our concerts will be absolutely inclusive of everyone in the community. The cost has to be cut down to minimum to make this happen. We have found a balance between the musical capability and the cost efficiency -- we made our orchestra as small as possible, while maintaining its musical capability. Also, we collaborate with community based non-profit organizations, which typically offer their spaces for free for admission free community events. This also keeps the cost low. We are thrilled to introduce live classical music to widely varied groups of people who are connected with such organizations, and to build new relationships in communities where people hardly have any access to live music performances.<br/> </p>
<p>Our orchestra is small enough to get out of concert halls, travel to where you are, and play in a smaller non-traditional venues. Despite its small size, this 11-piece-orchestra sounds very powerful because the size of the orchestra perfectly matches the intimacy of the venues we play in. Our live performances sound with full richness in spaces where orchestra performances have been considered to be impossible.<br/> </p>
<p>Artistically, we aim to perform the same program several times, in order to maintain the quality of the music and promote newly written works to a wider public. More than two performances of new works are usually a rarity due to the high production costs. In this, our strategy is unique;  We travel to several venues across Queens and repeat the same program. This will keep per-concert production costs low and keep the level of performance high; playing more performances foster a deeper understanding in the works we play. We are planning to record a CD at the end of a future concert tour across Queens, in which new works written by contemporary New York composers will be included.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>Upcoming project</strong></p>
<p>There are two concerts coming up in two different types of local communities as part of our pilot project. In this project, we will aim to create a collaborative relationships with the hosting organizations and their clients, where an orchestra has never been heard in live. The concert times are unique; both of these concerts will be a ""pre-dinner concert,"" one for a weeknight (6:30pm-7:30pm), and the other for Sunday (5:00pm-6:00pm). The concert will be much shorter than usual concerts and finish right by the dinner time. This is part of our effort in fitting the musical trend to today's changing demands. The ultimate goal of this upcoming project is to find collective interests among different groups, such as our audiences, local businesses, local representatives, local non-profits, foundations, and us, and form a sustainable scheme that provides live music to the communities for many years to come. At this time, as a one time thing, we run this crowdfunding campaign to get the seed money in order to help present ourselves at our best and form future support bases.   </p>

<p>Hi!  I'm Lindy Crandall.  Thanks for checking out my new project. I am a singer songwriter from San Diego, California.  I am also a Massage Therapist and Cosmetologist.  I've been singing, writing and performing almost my entire life.  I wrote my first song on the piano when I was ten, but I was writing melodies and lyrics well before that - using the top of the stairs in my childhood home as my stage.  Music truly feels like my purpose in life.</p><p>The project I’m about to start explores finding healing through the acceptance and the appreciation of life.  The album is dedicated to my late friend Rachel, who although struggled with diabetes for a lot of her life, never lost her vibrancy and love for the world.   When she died it was her lingering light and spirit that inspired me to write my songs Desert Rose and Frozen, and to value the time I was fortunate to have had with her.  With this album Desert Rose I share what knowing Rachel has taught me, in the hopes that you can get to know a little bit of her too.</p>
<p>The songs are meant not only to share Rachel’s love of life, but also to show people that it's okay to embrace pain in order to heal.  <span style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>Growing up I always knew I was different from the rest of my family.  I was sensitive and emotional, whereas my parents and sister were stoic and analytical.  I loved doing anything creative and writing songs helped me to find and accept myself at a young age.  As I got older, I realized that there are a lot of other people like me, but that society seems to view sensitivity as a weakness.  As an artist I want to highlight the power sensitive people can harness when they find the courage to be themselves - the gift which music has given me.  </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I’m so grateful for knowing Rachel;  I hope you will help me share the gift of her spirit with my songs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My goal is to raise $10,000 that will go towards recording the album, any musicians I have to hire, album art, promotion, and distribution.  Any and all funding will go into the album.  If I'm able to raise the entire $10,000 I expect to release 6 to 7 songs.  Less money will mean less songs and more money will mean more songs.  I’m really excited to be able to offer some unique perks because of my background in the spa industry.  With your help I can reach more people who have gone through similar struggles by getting my music out into the world.   Thank you so much for checking out my new project and for your support.</p>

Over the past three years I've been working on and releasing albums under different names and monikers, while supporting the communities and artists that follow the vaporwave genre.

When I began working on <b>WVSC</b>, I wanted to take the sound that I had invented for Reality and attach a personal story to it.  The biggest theme to the album for myself personally has to be <i>digital anxiety</i> and the effects of the Internet on our personal relationships. It plays with the listener to really surround them in the emotional state that inspired the album.<p></p> </div><div><br/></div><div><h3>Tragedy Strikes</h3></div><div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456952482/yhra5jp0iutldnvx5mwh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div><div>At the end of February, 2016 my production laptop (along with other recording gear) was stolen at a metro station, and after spending hours trying to work with the proper authorities I was basically told to give up and let my gear go. I instantaneously lost over 5 albums worth of unreleased songs, and hundreds of vaporwave art. All I have left is what is available for download on Bandcamp. I lost unreleased tracks, working files, miscellaneous mixdowns and even files for my previous vaporwave projects. Someone out there has everything and I have no way of finding them. </div><div><br/></div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Before my gear was stolen, I was preparing to re-release <i>WINDOWS VISTA SOCIAL CLUB</i> with Negative Plus Records (vaporwave label based in California). The new version would include remastered versions of the songs on the Bandcamp release, as well as 4 extra tracks (including a remix by San Antonio DJ <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/pagan-gold"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pagan Gold</a>). We were planning a limited cassette tape run, with possibility of a vinyl release in the near future. </p>
<p></p>
<p>I am currently trying to raise at least <b>$2,500</b>, with additional goals up to $5,500. Here's the breakdown:</p>
<p>Initial Goal: <b>$2,500</b></p>
<p><i>$1000</i> - <b>Replacing Stolen Gear:</b></p>
<p>I lost a laptop, an external hard drive, an audio interface, and a mini midi keyboard. This covers a basic laptop/audio interface, to give me back the ability to produce music.</p>
<p><i>$250</i> - <b>Studio Time:</b></p>
<p>I know that most vaporwave artists don't require studio time, but for WVSC I brought in two Bossa Nova guitarists, as well as a theremin player to get the sound I wanted. This covers studio time and hiring studio musicians to get an authentic and unique sound.</p>
<p><i>$1000</i> - <b>Printing Cassettes &amp; Merchandise:</b></p>
<p>We'll be producing cassette tapes, as well as specially designed t-shirts only available from this campaign, as well as 7"" x 7"" art prints.</p>
<p><i>$250</i> - <b>Shipping:</b></p>
<p>With fans all around the globe, I want to ensure that the album gets into each of their hands. Whether they're in the UK or Argentina, this covers any and all shipping costs.</p>
<p>Additional Goals:</p>
<p><i>$3,500</i> - <b>Different cassette colours!</b></p>
<p>This will allow us to get WVSC printed in different colour cassette tapes. Grab one in your favourite colour, or collect them all!</p>
<p><i>$4,000</i> - <b>[ R e a l i t y ] 現実歪曲 LP Cassette Release:</b></p>
<p>If we reach this goal, we will produce a cassette release for my first album. A copy will be included with each cassette order/pledge for WVSC.</p>
<p><i>$5,500</i> - <b>WVSC Premium Art Book</b></p>
<p>A 16-page high-quality, glossy art book that features all of the art and designs I've created for WVSC. It features lyrics, behind-the-scenes looks, as well as me explaining my inspiration process for the tracks on WVSC.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Anyone who donates anything will be sent a link where they can download my first album, <i>[ R e a l i t y ] 現実歪曲 LP</i>, for free. Other perks could include advanced copies of the album, specially designed Bo-[ r e a l ] t-shirts that can only be received by donating here, autographed cassette tapes, or even guaranteed free copies of everything I release from now until the end of eternity.</p>
<p>If I don't reach my goal of $2,500, the money you donate will still be put towards the album's release. It is very important for me to replace my stolen gear, so that is high on my priority list and it will be something you can point to and say ""I helped make that happen."" But if I miraculously surpass my goal, then that's giving <i>WINDOWS VISTA SOCIAL CLUB</i> more chance of being a successful album.</p>
<p>Any perks you order will be shipped a couple weeks after the campaign ends.</p>

When I began working on WVSC, I wanted to take the sound that I had invented for Reality and attach a personal story to it.  The biggest theme to the album for myself personally has to be digital anxiety and the effects of the Internet on our personal relationships. It plays with the listener to really surround them in the emotional state that inspired the album. Tragedy StrikesAt the end of February, 2016 my production laptop (along with other recording gear) was stolen at a metro station, and after spending hours trying to work with the proper authorities I was basically told to give up and let my gear go. I instantaneously lost over 5 albums worth of unreleased songs, and hundreds of vaporwave art. All I have left is what is available for download on Bandcamp. I lost unreleased tracks, working files, miscellaneous mixdowns and even files for my previous vaporwave projects. Someone out there has everything and I have no way of finding them.   What We Need & What You Get Before my gear was stolen, I was preparing to re-release WINDOWS VISTA SOCIAL CLUB with Negative Plus Records (vaporwave label based in California). The new version would include remastered versions of the songs on the Bandcamp release, as well as 4 extra tracks (including a remix by San Antonio DJ Pagan Gold). We were planning a limited cassette tape run, with possibility of a vinyl release in the near future. 

I am currently trying to raise at least $2,500, with additional goals up to $5,500. Here's the breakdown:
Initial Goal: $2,500
$1000 - Replacing Stolen Gear:
I lost a laptop, an external hard drive, an audio interface, and a mini midi keyboard. This covers a basic laptop/audio interface, to give me back the ability to produce music.
$250 - Studio Time:
I know that most vaporwave artists don't require studio time, but for WVSC I brought in two Bossa Nova guitarists, as well as a theremin player to get the sound I wanted. This covers studio time and hiring studio musicians to get an authentic and unique sound.
$1000 - Printing Cassettes & Merchandise:
We'll be producing cassette tapes, as well as specially designed t-shirts only available from this campaign, as well as 7"" x 7"" art prints.
$250 - Shipping:
With fans all around the globe, I want to ensure that the album gets into each of their hands. Whether they're in the UK or Argentina, this covers any and all shipping costs.
Additional Goals:
$3,500 - Different cassette colours!
This will allow us to get WVSC printed in different colour cassette tapes. Grab one in your favourite colour, or collect them all!
$4,000 - [ R e a l i t y ] 現実歪曲 LP Cassette Release:
If we reach this goal, we will produce a cassette release for my first album. A copy will be included with each cassette order/pledge for WVSC.
$5,500 - WVSC Premium Art Book
A 16-page high-quality, glossy art book that features all of the art and designs I've created for WVSC. It features lyrics, behind-the-scenes looks, as well as me explaining my inspiration process for the tracks on WVSC.


Anyone who donates anything will be sent a link where they can download my first album, [ R e a l i t y ] 現実歪曲 LP, for free. Other perks could include advanced copies of the album, specially designed Bo-[ r e a l ] t-shirts that can only be received by donating here, autographed cassette tapes, or even guaranteed free copies of everything I release from now until the end of eternity.
If I don't reach my goal of $2,500, the money you donate will still be put towards the album's release. It is very important for me to replace my stolen gear, so that is high on my priority list and it will be something you can point to and say ""I helped make that happen."" But if I miraculously surpass my goal, then that's giving WINDOWS VISTA SOCIAL CLUB more chance of being a successful album.
Any perks you order will be shipped a couple weeks after the campaign ends.



The Impact
 Vaporwave is still a relatively new genre, born out of the Internet in the 2010s. Click here to watch Vaporwave: A Brief History. I have been actively supporting it since came to fruition, and is something that you can literally watch as it evolves. There's already countless sub-genres branching off vaporwave, as well as an entire art form. If you support this album, you're not just supporting vaporwave music, you're supporting one of (if not the first) art movements born out of the Internet age. 


    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:  Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about your campaign. Remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools!   And thank you for any contribution, however big or small, you have made to helping vaporwave.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>The cards have fallen into place. </b></p>
<p>It genuinely feels like all the elements have come together by the grace of God and we’re now on the verge of something very special. After the success of his most recent solo project, <b>“<i>The Whistles And The Bells</i>”</b>, my long-time friend, <b>Bryan Simpson</b>, asked if I knew just exactly where I'm heading with this group and encouraged me to do everything I can to take it to the next level. “Seize The Day!”, he said. Now after <i>very</i> long days and many hours of writing new material while diving deep into what I wanted to say with this project, we finally came face to face with the obstacle we’d been avoiding; the inevitable question of, 'So how are you going to pay for this endeavor?’. The time has finally come to make a decision. After deliberating with my management, wife and family, we’ve decided this is our best path to success. Our goals, ambitions, and big ideas can be attained on our current trajectory, <i>especially</i> with you guys behind us. It’s <b>YOU</b> that we have chosen to partner with and help to take us to the next level. </p>
<p><b>It leaves us, and you. A direct path.</b></p>
<p>Through our team of mentors and our completely amazing fan base, we have graciously sustained ourselves by <b>keeping all of the proceeds</b> from anything having to do with our band. </p>

</h3>
<p>ELP
 has always been on a mission. A mission to bring the message of Livity 
to the masses, to spread positive vibes; to advocate a message of peace,
 harmony &amp; acceptance for all people. And we do this through 
positive-vibes, reggae rock music.</p>
<p>“Combining the best of multiple
 genres into a cohesive, catchy and memorable sound is not a simple 
thing to do. Yet, this Cincinnati-based, multi-talented quintet does 
just that. Fuse “old school” Rock-n-Roll with Jam &amp; Roots and 
masterfully layer it over a solid Reggae base and you have the distinct 
sound of Elementree Livity Project. Whether in a room at the back of a 
coffee house or an auditorium for thousands, ELP brings people together.
 When the band clicks on all cylinders, it’s noticeable.” – Michael 
Clare, mikecimages.</p>
<p>For our upcoming full-length studio debut,
 ELP has some lofty goals. Put simply we want to release the BEST reggae
 rock record of 2016/2017 and tour to support the effort. We want our 
debut LP to carry our message, be musically well representative of who 
we are and to reach as many friendly ears as possible, We are 
aggressively striving for this album to be the best it can be, to really
 move our fans and to make an impact in the music industry.<br/><br/>And 
so we’ve partnered with the one and only Michael G. of Easy Star Records
 to help us do just that. We have an opportunity to record with one of 
the most successful reggae record producers in recent history.<br/><br/>Michael
 has written, produced, arranged and played on many of Easy Star’s 
releases, and has worked with some of the biggest names in reggae 
including Matisyahu, Steel Pulse, Rebelution, Third World, Luciano, 
Sugar Minott, Toots &amp; the Maytals, Sister Carol, The Meditations, 
Ranking Joe, Frankie Paul, Morgan Heritage, Israel Vibration, Horace 
Andy, Sister Nancy, and Half Pint. He also produced Zion Crossroads for 
acclaimed blues artist Corey Harris, and the self-titled Hatikva 6 for 
Israel’s leading reggae band.  In 2011, Michael did a dub version of 
top-selling U.S. reggae band Rebelution’s entire album Peace of Mind. He
 has done remixes for diverse artists such as Yoko Ono, Umphrey’s McGee,
 and Tommy T of Gogol Bordello. (Taken from <a href=""http://www.michaelgoldwasser.com/BIO.aspx%29"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.michaelgoldwasser.com/BIO.aspx)</a></p>
<p>Obviously, we would prefer to raise all of the funds on our own, but 
find ourselves in a little bit of a Catch-22 as the album will help us 
tour and raise the funds, but we need the album first.</p>Our dreams 
are now within reach, but the road has its tolls. It's gonna take some 
significant expense to get where we are going. And with YOUR help, we know that we can get there. Thank you for your interest. Bless up! #elp513 #supportlocalmusic #onelove<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>Why are we asking for $15,000?</h3> <p>We are actually only asking for less than half of what we need to take this project from dream to reality. We are committing $35,000 of our money, but need another $15K to do this thing right. Why so much money?:</p> <ul> <li>As you can imagine, working with a top producer costs a little bit more than using the guy who has a recording studio in his basement.</li>
<li>$5K+ for studio rental</li>
<li>$5K+ for mixing studio</li>
<li>$3K to travel to New York to record for 12 days.</li>
<li>$3K-5K for equipment rental needs, guest artists, and travel, room and board for producer - both in Cincinnati and in New York. </li> <li>$10K for distribution and publicity to make sure all the work we put into the album actually gets heard.</li>
<li>Bonus: If we surpass goal, $5K for touring and merch expenses to tour on our first album and bring Livity to the masses on a national scale.<br/>
</li> <li>Regardless o the outcome of this campaign, we are determined and confident that we will make this project happen at any cost, but we would really use your help to make this happen.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>How will this impact us?</h3> <p>Honestly, this is a life-changing moment for us. We are committed to making the best album possible and turning our dreams of being a full-time professionally touring  band. You can help be a big part in changing five guys' (and their families) lives forever. We truly believe in the positive message of Livity and feel like this will help us get the message to the masses. <br/></p> <ul></ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> Again, we are committed to making this happen, but the risk is that if unsuccessful, it will take us a little longer to get our positive message out to the world. Other obstacles certainly include additional costs that are unforeseen at the time. Regardless, we are driven to make this dream a reality and feel confident in the path we have chosen.<br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>We certainly appreciate your consideration and absolutely realize that some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help us reach our goal:</p> <ul> <li>Whether you donate or not, we would love your help in spreading the word about this campaign and help us promote our message to anyone who may be willing to help.</li> <li>Any help in sharing this in your social networks, or emailing other people you think may be interested is greatly appreciated and will never be forgotten.</li> </ul> </div></div>","Elementree Livity Project is recording a new album, and we need YOUR help!

Andy, Sister Nancy, and Half Pint. He also produced Zion Crossroads for 
acclaimed blues artist Corey Harris, and the self-titled Hatikva 6 for 
Israel’s leading reggae band.  In 2011, Michael did a dub version of 
top-selling U.S. reggae band Rebelution’s entire album Peace of Mind. He
 has done remixes for diverse artists such as Yoko Ono, Umphrey’s McGee,
 and Tommy T of Gogol Bordello. (Taken from http://www.michaelgoldwasser.com/BIO.aspx)
Obviously, we would prefer to raise all of the funds on our own, but 
find ourselves in a little bit of a Catch-22 as the album will help us 
tour and raise the funds, but we need the album first.Our dreams 
are now within reach, but the road has its tolls. It's gonna take some 
significant expense to get where we are going. And with YOUR help, we know that we can get there. Thank you for your interest. Bless up! #elp513 #supportlocalmusic #onelove   Why are we asking for $15,000? We are actually only asking for less than half of what we need to take this project from dream to reality. We are committing $35,000 of our money, but need another $15K to do this thing right. Why so much money?:  As you can imagine, working with a top producer costs a little bit more than using the guy who has a recording studio in his basement.
$5K+ for studio rental
$5K+ for mixing studio
$3K to travel to New York to record for 12 days.
$3K-5K for equipment rental needs, guest artists, and travel, room and board for producer - both in Cincinnati and in New York.  $10K for distribution and publicity to make sure all the work we put into the album actually gets heard.
Bonus: If we surpass goal, $5K for touring and merch expenses to tour on our first album and bring Livity to the masses on a national scale.
 Regardless o the outcome of this campaign, we are determined and confident that we will make this project happen at any cost, but we would really use your help to make this happen.    How will this impact us? Honestly, this is a life-changing moment for us. We are committed to making the best album possible and turning our dreams of being a full-time professionally touring  band. You can help be a big part in changing five guys' (and their families) lives forever. We truly believe in the positive message of Livity and feel like this will help us get the message to the masses.     Risks & Challenges  Again, we are committed to making this happen, but the risk is that if unsuccessful, it will take us a little longer to get our positive message out to the world. Other obstacles certainly include additional costs that are unforeseen at the time. Regardless, we are driven to make this dream a reality and feel confident in the path we have chosen.   Other Ways You Can Help We certainly appreciate your consideration and absolutely realize that some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help us reach our goal:  Whether you donate or not, we would love your help in spreading the word about this campaign and help us promote our message to anyone who may be willing to help. Any help in sharing this in your social networks, or emailing other people you think may be interested is greatly appreciated and will never be forgotten.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

In the summer of 2015, we launched two competitions: Our first call-for-scores for composers, and our first call-for-tracks for jazz/pop/hip-hop artists. The selected composers will have their pieces performed in one of our fall concerts, and the selected solo artists will have their track arranged to perform as a soloist with the group. ShoutHouse can't wait to hit the ground running this year with music that will challenge listeners (and our performers) to rethink genre and aesthetics, while bringing together diverse artistic voices in the process. <p></p>
<p>We have four primary concerts lined up for the coming season. Mark your calendars for the following dates: October 15, 2015, December 11, 2015, March 10, 2016 and June 1, 2016.  By donating today at a level of $50 or more, you will receive <b>free admission</b> to any two of these concerts.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>By supporting ShoutHouse's work this year, you will be showing your commitment to thoughtful, powerful music that knows no boundaries. </b>At ShoutHouse, we believe that music is a dialogue. Each genre is like a different language, though, and there are few opportunities for classical, jazz, and hip-hop artists to communicate in a meaningful musical way. Over the past two years, through trial and error, we have worked to develop a sound that synthesizes these influences without sacrificing their integrity. Through a combination of improvised and notated music, spoken word and sung poetry, we are creating something unique, important, and worth supporting.</p>
<p>The costs associated with concert production, rehearsal time and space, recording and video production for a group of this size are substantial. We can use all the help we can get! Whether it be $5, $25, $100 or $100,000,000, any contribution will go a long way towards allowing us to continue doing what we love to do: building, through music, an artistic community that celebrates cultural difference by refusing to be inhibited by it.  </p>
<p>We hope you'll join this community by pledging your support, coming to shows, and engaging with, questioning, and spreading the message of our group. Help us keep the creative energy of our city alive and stronger than ever!</p>

For the last two years, we have been funded largely by out-of-pocket spending.  However, as our vision has expanded and our mission has grown, our need for funding has likewise increased. In 2015-16, we are applying for a variety of public and private arts grants (including fiscal support from the Fractured Atlas organization) which will hopefully support us in the coming years. In order to fund this season, however, we need the support of our audience.<p></p>
<p>The $8,000 we are hoping to raise will go entirely towards the production of our first two concerts in the Fall. Expenses associated with these concerts include $2,000 for venue rental, $1,000 for rehearsal space, $500 for equipment rental and cartage, and $4,500 for artist fees.</p>
<p>See those perks over the right side of your screen? These are our special way of thanking you for your invaluable support. Want to a signed copy of our album? Just $25! Want the album PLUS free admission to any two concerts this season? THAT CAN HAPPEN for only $50! We will doodle you a personal thank you card, read and record your music, or perform a private concert just for YOU!</p>

None of this can happen without you and without your support. Thank you so much!</p><p>Love,</p><p>ShoutHouse</p></div>","ShoutHouse 2015-16What's in store? This coming year will be our most ambitious; we will be performing live throughout NYC, recording new music, filming our first music video, and beginning exciting new collaborations with hip-hop, jazz, and visual artists who will bring our sound to a new level. In the summer of 2015, we launched two competitions: Our first call-for-scores for composers, and our first call-for-tracks for jazz/pop/hip-hop artists. The selected composers will have their pieces performed in one of our fall concerts, and the selected solo artists will have their track arranged to perform as a soloist with the group. ShoutHouse can't wait to hit the ground running this year with music that will challenge listeners (and our performers) to rethink genre and aesthetics, while bringing together diverse artistic voices in the process. 
We have four primary concerts lined up for the coming season. Mark your calendars for the following dates: October 15, 2015, December 11, 2015, March 10, 2016 and June 1, 2016.  By donating today at a level of $50 or more, you will receive free admission to any two of these concerts.

I knew I wanted to profoundly affect the lives of others in some way and make a change for the better by reaching out to people.

By sharing our stories and experiences with one another- most meaningfully through the expression of music- we enhance our empathy for, and our understanding of, each other. And thus we become closer as people. Music is one of the best depictions of the human condition, it portrays every emotion and feeling we manifest, and can sometimes tell our stories much better than we can alone.

We met while attending Columbia Teachers College together (and we're graduating soon!), and we played our first show together when I (Sarah) recorded an acoustic EP (you can listen to it <a href=""sarahkang.bandcamp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>) and asked my friends Tim and Yan to play with me at my EP release show last May. That EP was called Fair Weather, and we officially started playing together with that name  since August 2015. </p>
<p>We sprang from the little musings of one voice and one guitar and grew into a full band sound with indie-folk-rock-pop-soul influences. We added two more friends (a drummer and keyboardist) to our band, and we've been furiously writing and performing at venues all over New York City, including the Bowery Electric, The Delancey, Pianos, and Rockwood Music Hall. (Check out our live videos in the Gallery!) Our music has been compared to Poliça, Radiohead, Chvrches, and Feist, but we like to think of our songs as a collision of five friends who come from different places with different tastes and perspectives. We are thankful for the support and encouragement of our friends, of accidental fans, of passersby, and of other artists. There is nothing like singing, playing, and dancing with friends - both in the band and the audience. </p>
<p>However, as much as we love performing, we believe that artists were meant to create. We've come to the part of our journey where we want to create something that endures beyond the shows and the stage. Our goal is to record our first studio EP and to release it in late winter/early spring! </p>

It comprises the best of my first 6 years of successful writing, fusing it with the sounds I've been developing at the piano, in groups, and on the road.

<p>Two years ago, when the idea for this project came to me, I had just secured two grants from the Western Massachusetts Training Consortium to fund a record.

In April of 2014, I decided to bring both my music and poetry together for the first time in the studio. I realized just how much they overlapped. Now I have a record that I want to share with you: American Thicket. It comprises the best of my first 6 years of successful writing, fusing it with the sounds I've been developing at the piano, in groups, and on the road. The resulting music, played by Mat Maneri, Thomas Morgan, Flin van Hemmen and myself, is gruff, urgent, subtle and effusive. I hope you will listen.


Let me in turn introduce this project to you in the hopes that you will not only see what an effort these musicians have made, but share in this experience which has so deeply informed my artistic life for the past two years.

I need funding to complete this record. The album is finished, literally; fully recorded, mixed and mastered - right now I just need enough to cover the manufacturing costs of a short run of physical CDs so that I can bring this music home to you. Now that you've heard about the music we make as a collective ensemble, here's a little bit about each musician in the band.  If you haven't yet, I hope you will give this music a listen so you can truly hear what this project is about.  





Personnel:
Eliot Cardinaux - piano, compositions, poetry, spoken word
Mat Maneri - viola
Thomas Morgan - upright bass
Flin van Hemmen - drums, percussion


Mat Maneri is a violist and violinist whose early musical exploits with his father - saxophonist, pianist, clarinetist and composer Joe Maneri (an ECM recording artist and professor of microtonal music at New England Conservatory, now deceased) - have led him into a highly prolific career as a working improviser, with musicians as distinct and renowned as Paul Motian, Cecil Taylor, Matthew Shipp, and Joe Morris.



Thomas Morgan as a bassist has worked intimately with master musicians such as Bill Frisell, Paul Motian, Masabumi Kikuchi, David Binney, Craig Taborn, and Tyshawn Sorey. His sense of melody and space can bring even the most complex music to life with a deeply felt simplicity evocative of an image of someone a great many years wiser than he. 





Flin van Hemmen is a drummer/percussionist who has worked as an improviser on the New York scene with consistency over the past ten years. He has been featured in bands led by one of New York's most highly coveted voices, tenor and soprano saxophonist Tony Malaby, as well as in Norwegian top-call New York bassist Eivind Opsvik's band, Overseas, and has developed projects with countless other highly skilled musical craftsmen in New York and abroad, always bringing something gentle yet audaciously honest to the table.

<p> We face some pretty big risks in this campaign, even though it is a small minimum - we've invested considerable time and a fair deal of monies in getting this going. Aside from that potentially being wasted, issues that could crop up include:<br/></p> <ul> <li>
<b>Production delays: </b>Vinyl manufacturers are overburdened and lead times vary anywhere between 4 weeks to pretty much a whole year. We've been quoted at 20 weeks total but this can change dramatically by the time the funds are raised. There isn't much we can do about this, but we will communicate any thing we hear to our backers ASAP!<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<ul> <li>
<b>Unexpected Costs or emergencies:</b> Although we have budgeted conservatively, something can always go wrong. Maybe our packaging materials will be ironically damaged when shipped to us, or our run of Vinyls is lost in a storm! These issues fall on us to deal with to the best of our ability and will result in a lot of extra work and money.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Damaged Vinyls: </b>Although we have planned to purchase all the shipping items we need to safely send the vinyls as secure as possible, they are fragile items and if mishandled or not secured properly en route may damage the vinyl itself or the jacket. We are prepared for a 15% return rate in the case of this and will send another.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Not Making our goal:</b> If we don't make the minimum but we made enough to at least fulfill our total Vinyl orders if we get a cheaper manufacturer, or cut back on printing materials, etc. we will but it to a vote for our backers: Raise the rest of the funds (more time waiting) or fulfill the vinyl orders as is with a lower quality product. <br/><br/>If we don't make enough to fulfill the vinyl orders the money will most likely go toward creating the single or next EP, and if so we'll create a backer exclusive edition with bonus tracks for your ears only. <br/><br/>Either way, if something goes wrong we will figure out options and put it to a backer vote!<br/><br/><b>Got a better idea for resolving an issue?</b> Please let us know! After all, the support is coming from <b>YOUR</b> dollar and we want to make sure everything works out in the end!<br/>

 If we had the funds, it would still be difficult to reach out to everyone we met on tour directly. Using INDIEGOGO creates an easy way for us to share this with our fans, the venues we've played, and friends who can help us reach all the . It's also a great way to get shipping info for anyone who wants our album or other goodies!





Now for the fun part! If we are successful here is what we'll be creating, and furthermore what we hope to achieve together!  $2,800 - Casual Mode - At this level we can get a standard 12"" vinyl LP with a basic printed jacket. It will make us 250 Vinyls.

$3,400 - Hero Mode - Our secondary goal is to upgrade to durable 180 gram vinyls and a sweet gate-fold jacket with interior art featuring the names of all of you beautiful people who helped make this a reality.
All levels include the cost of good packaging materials to make sure we've done all we can to get them to you safely. Interior art update coming soon!




Each tier includes whats listed in the perks and may unlock future bonuses with your involvement in a successful campaign! In addition to the vinyl and our existing music we are sooner or later headed into the studio to record a new single.
We are uploading some rare audio, preview tracks, and are hoping to make some other goodies that only our backers can access!(""Big Tip"" includes this tier)


Immediately download our Album & EP in your choice of format from Bandcamp and get the new single for free when it is released! (""Just The Vinyl, Please"" includes this tier)


You'll get the commemorative poster along with the signed Vinyl. If we do well you can expect more goodies like a full version of our upcoming game.


A merchandise package including all of our music is on the way as well as the signed vinyl! Bonuses include a character in our upcoming games, early access, and more.  
It's an early-bird special for the first few backers - You get one of our test copies of the Vinyl album before the official release! You shall also receive all of our existing merchandise. We'll also make a point to tour where you want us in 2016!

Unlocks everything forever! Additionally we'll come play a private show for you, or get you backstage and to hang out with us for dinner, if you don't want us tearing up your living room. (""Brah"" Includes this tier"") 
Yeah! What would an IndieGoGo campaign be without stretch goals! Lets see...we have quite a few ideas. Some of the things we plan to do:
Commemorative Campaign Merchandise (unlocked for Level 2 backers)

A new EP release (unlocked at Levels 1 and up, CD's unlocked at Level 3)

A new video directed by Youtube and Newgrounds star SexuaLobster

A video game (access unlocked at Level 1, Early Access at ""Girl Friar"")

A national tour (Choose where at Level 3 and up!)


We'll unveil more detailed information and cost levels for each as soon as we hit our minimum goal! 
Have ideas for stretch goals? We didn't call this ""FORWARD TOGETHER!"" for no good reason. Please feel free to let us know what you would like out of your support!

 
  

 We face some pretty big risks in this campaign, even though it is a small minimum - we've invested considerable time and a fair deal of monies in getting this going. Aside from that potentially being wasted, issues that could crop up include:  
Production delays: Vinyl manufacturers are overburdened and lead times vary anywhere between 4 weeks to pretty much a whole year. We've been quoted at 20 weeks total but this can change dramatically by the time the funds are raised. There isn't much we can do about this, but we will communicate any thing we hear to our backers ASAP!


 
Unexpected Costs or emergencies: Although we have budgeted conservatively, something can always go wrong. Maybe our packaging materials will be ironically damaged when shipped to us, or our run of Vinyls is lost in a storm! These issues fall on us to deal with to the best of our ability and will result in a lot of extra work and money.



Damaged Vinyls: Although we have planned to purchase all the shipping items we need to safely send the vinyls as secure as possible, they are fragile items and if mishandled or not secured properly en route may damage the vinyl itself or the jacket. We are prepared for a 15% return rate in the case of this and will send another.


Not Making our goal: If we don't make the minimum but we made enough to at least fulfill our total Vinyl orders if we get a cheaper manufacturer, or cut back on printing materials, etc. we will but it to a vote for our backers: Raise the rest of the funds (more time waiting) or fulfill the vinyl orders as is with a lower quality product. If we don't make enough to fulfill the vinyl orders the money will most likely go toward creating the single or next EP, and if so we'll create a backer exclusive edition with bonus tracks for your ears only. Either way, if something goes wrong we will figure out options and put it to a backer vote!Got a better idea for resolving an issue? Please let us know! After all, the support is coming from YOUR dollar and we want to make sure everything works out in the end!


    

Any support is extremely appreciated, even if you don't purchase a 
Vinyl. We try our best to support the disenfranchised (it is called 
FRINGE punk after all) by participating at community events throughout the year. On our upcoming tours we are planning to play at community and youth 
centers all over the country and at all-ages spaces. For the kids!

It's cool! We know how it goes. If you would like to still help us please use the Indiegogo sharing tools to tell the world! 
Better yet, show your friends this page yourself, or call them up and tell them. Post us in your music sharing groups, etc. We will appreciate you sharing this page greatly. Let us know if you do! We would love to return the favor or otherwise get you something.
Thanks for reading all the way to the bottom! We hope you decide to help us make these vinyls (and other goodies) a reality. After all,  there is no fry without you!",18.0,0,"1 Campaign

hello! I am Emma van Heyn, on the brink of releasing my debut album, Asylum. I am a 21-year-old
singer-songwriter from Cape Town, South Africa. I have been working on this
music for quite some time – writing songs, self-producing them and recording them.
I would really like to ensure that I can get these songs out there with full
exposure and in the best possible quality. This is why I would love your help!
Debut Album - Asylum
I am
incredibly excited about this product. It is a 15 track album made up of all-original
content. I have already recorded this album, working with an extremely talented
engineer, Uys Visser at Uys Visser Productions in the beautiful town of
Franschhoek. If all goes well, I will be releasing the album by the end of
August 2016. 
There are a
few costs that I will need to cover for its release:

Engineering
Costs

Studio Time

Mastering
Costs

Photographer
– Publicity Shots & Album Cover

Dress
Design

Album
Design

Album
Printing

Album
Promotion

Publicity

Live Album
Launch

Musicians


I
conceptualise, direct and edit my own music videos. The more songs I release,
the costlier these music videos become as a collective. 
These costs
include:

Venue Hire

Costume
Design

Equipment
Hire

Technical
Team


And the
magic number I need is… $7000! Now, that sounds like a lot of money. But! I can
assure you that every bit of your donation will not go to waste.

Let me introduce myself




I am a
little lady with big hair, but more importantly, I take song writing very
seriously because I take the issues I write about very seriously. My songs come
from a place of personal justice and situational passion. Every song has a
different theme that I think will relate to many of you. Some of the themes
include love, betrayal, political corruption, abuse and female exploitation.

I will be SO thankful for your help! I am currently finishing up my
degree in Drama at Stellenbosch University. I live off eggs on crackers so I
can pay my musicians and pay off my father who has been helping me out with my
musical demands. Am I complaining? No way! In fact, I absolutely love it. I
love it because I know this album will reap the benefits if it is released
properly. Your donation will help me incredibly and my appreciation for this is
beyond the realms of appreciation.

How else can you help?

Share and
spread the word! Thank you for taking the time to see what this album is about.
I can guarantee you this will not disappoint!",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What's the story?</h3>
<p> I remember being a young girl, who loved singing, and was constantly being moved by music. I knew from a young age that I wanted to use music to change things. I knew I was meant for it, but I didn't know what it would look like to step into it. As I've developed in God and in who I know I am, I've realized, there's no set way of going about it. The dreams I have, the destiny I am stewarding, it's all from Him. And He knows what it looks like. I've realized <strong>all He wants is our 'yes'</strong>. I have wanted to share my music for a long time, but it wasn't until recently that I really felt God say '<strong>it's time</strong>'. I am beyond excited to get started, and to run full-force into this. </p>
<p>The music I will share with you is inspired by a huge mix of different moments. Moments where I've been worshipping in my incredible community and capturing the journey we've been on together. And moments when it's just me and God, where Him and I are in our own little world of intimacy that makes my heart come alive. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>I am so full of excitement when I think of the process of this album, and even though it can be intimidating, <strong>I know God's got this</strong>. I am not in this alone!  I have so many incredible people who have known me, seen my journey, seen me grow, and who I am so PUMPED to welcome on board in this project. Friends who are great at their craft, and have incredible hearts for worship. We have the passion and the heart, what we need next is support. </p>
<p>Our goal is to raise <strong>$10,000,</strong> which will cover the cost of the process from beginning to end. Here's what the process looks like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-production (My talented, longtime friend <strong>Stephen Heidinga</strong> is producing this album, and there is no one I trust more to do an incredible job.)</li>
<li>Hiring passionate professionals for the extra goodness</li>
<li>Studio recording</li>
<li>Mixing (music, not pizza dough)</li>
<li>Mastering and finalizing</li>
<li>Album promotion</li>
<li>ALBUM RELEASE (W0000000)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Of course any support is valued <strong>beyond measure</strong>. Whatever you can give financially, it will all go to the same place, and to the same dream coming true. Here are a few other ways that you can be involved in a practical way:</p>
</div><div><ul>
<li>
<strong>PRAYER</strong>. I know this project is backed up by our incredible Heavenly Father, and we want this process to go as smoothly as possible. Pray for us! Pray for inspiration, provision, fun, and pray that this album can reach people with the Father's love.</li>
<li>
<strong>SPREAD THE WORD</strong>! All it takes is the click of a button for this project to be shared all over the world. Even if you're afraid of looking like that crazy person that shares the same thing everyday, from the bottom of my heart, I thank you, and you can take comfort knowing that I will be that other crazy person right alongside you. </li>
</ul></div><p>My heart is for this album to create a safe place for people to connect with their Father. My prayer is that every part of this process from beginning to end, would glorify God, and who He is. </p><p>Thank you for partnering with me, believing in me, and staying tuned as I jump out of the boat into this adventure. <br/><br/>In love and excitement, <br/>Talia D'Orazio</p></div>","What's the story?

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is David Davis and I am a saxophonist and producer out of Connecticut. I have been a full-time independent artist for 30 years. It has been almost ten years since my last release. This hiatus has given me the opportunity to focus on other things in life; for instance, creating a family. My journey in this life thus far has made me see how life is truly fascinating! I really do not take for granted my gift that the creator gave me to share with all that I can. I have 40 days to raise the funds to complete my next ground-breaking recording project. The goal is to have it ready for you within 90 days. I have always wanted to figure out more ways to connect with you- the fans, and find ways to make it a different and unique experience. I believe this is it!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The goal of this project is to create a team that can and will make this project an international success. From mixing and mastering engineers, PR, Radio Promotions, Marketing and sales, to having some of the greatest musicians around as part of the recording. It’s going to take capital (and lots of favors) to make this work. Fortunately I have been working on the project for some time now and I am about 90% done with the recording portion. I have broken the process down in stages.</p>
<p>1.  The first stage is to complete the recording and mix and master the project. – <b>@ $10,000</b></p>
<p>       a.  Secure cameo musicians to record on the CD- there are a few more songs that I’d like to feature a vocalist or musician(s).</p>
<p>       b.  Mix and Master the recordings for post production- This is a part of the production process that is very important and want to make sure we use an industry engineer that is stellar at their craft, to help breathe life into the already great sounding songs.</p>
<p>2.  The next stage will be to manufacture the project. - <b>@ $3,000</b></p>
<p>       a.  Using Discmakers to manufacture the CD- Photoshoot, graphic design, CD packaging, etc.</p>
<p>       b.  CD and digital format</p>
<p>3.  The last stage is for Marketing and Sales for the project.- <b>@ $15,000</b></p>
<p>       a.  Securing a Public Relations firm or person- To take the project to the next level as far as visibility in magazines, television and social media.</p>
<p>       b.  Securing a Radio Promoter for a campaign- To get the music to radio stations to be in regular rotation.</p>
<p>       c.  Social Media Push-</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The total budget is $28,000 to complete the project and begin the marketing strategy. Money that is raised without reaching the goal will go towards the completion of the recording and manufacturing. Once having the recording in hand and ready for the public, I would continue to raise money for the rest of the stages to be met.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Take a look at all the great rewards listed for your contributions. Imagine having a song at the end of the CD that mentions your name or someone else’s you’d like to submit. Or a custom-made song for you to use as a voicemail message (or answering machine for those of you who still use them). You can even work with a few people or a corporation for me come do a live private performance at a venue (charge your friends and family at the door if you’d like). And even more awesome, you can choose to contribute to be able to have yourself or someone else actually sing or play an instrument on the CD. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I have successfully completed and distributed 8 past recordings independently. However, I need to take it to the next level and focus on doing more festival shows and live performances with this next project. You contributing to this campaign will help me to assemble the right team of people needed to do what they are more experienced at doing than me. I believe I have something very unique to share with the world. I would be honored to be able to say that I couldn’t have done it without YOU.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The challenge of getting the tasks done has most of the time been about not having the money. Now that I have a viable product, right contacts and detailed strategy, all that is left is capital and limited time. It will be a challenge pushing it to be completed in less than 90 days. That isn’t a lot of time but it is still very doable, especially if the capital is not an issue. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p> </p>
</div><p>Other ways you can help in addition to contributing is to get the word out to everyone you know. Reach out to all the churches, promoters, organizations and groups that enjoy my music and ask that they spread the word as well. Sharing this information is very easy by using the Indiegogo share tools within this site. Also, if you had any leads to individuals I do not know of that may be interested in contributing, please message me their info as well.</p><p> </p></div>","Short Summary

However, I need to take it to the next level and focus on doing more festival shows and live performances with this next project. You contributing to this campaign will help me to assemble the right team of people needed to do what they are more experienced at doing than me. I believe I have something very unique to share with the world. I would be honored to be able to say that I couldn’t have done it without YOU.

Risks & Challenges
 
The challenge of getting the tasks done has most of the time been about not having the money. Now that I have a viable product, right contacts and detailed strategy, all that is left is capital and limited time. It will be a challenge pushing it to be completed in less than 90 days. That isn’t a lot of time but it is still very doable, especially if the capital is not an issue. 

Other Ways You Can Help
 
Other ways you can help in addition to contributing is to get the word out to everyone you know. Reach out to all the churches, promoters, organizations and groups that enjoy my music and ask that they spread the word as well. Sharing this information is very easy by using the Indiegogo share tools within this site. Also, if you had any leads to individuals I do not know of that may be interested in contributing, please message me their info as well.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>What started as a musical bond that formed while attending Berklee College of Music manifested itself into a deep connection to the ideals of Ubuntu. Amazingly enough, we were drawn to each other through our differences, both musical and cultural. This diversity inspired us to create a sound that is genre-bending, energetic, and socially-conscious. All this we hope to embody in our upcoming release: The Beautiful Ones EP. In order to realize our goal, we need some help with production costs. <br/><br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Goal- $2,900</h3>
<p><b>Studio Time- $1,200</b><br/>The EP is going to be recorded at Perfection Studios/The Record Company in Boston, MA. Both of these facilities are some of the most renowned recording spaces in Boston with top of the line gear. We'll be doing two 6 hour tracking sessions and six 4 hour overdub sessions. Remember we are a 9 piece band so although studio time can seem steep, we want to ensure our product is of the best quality, for you! </p>
<p><strong>Engineering/ Mixing- $1580</strong><br/>The studios in Boston require us to bring our own engineer to all the sessions we do. We are fortunate enough to have Jacob McCaslin and James Mellett, engineer and mixer respectively. They both work extremely hard to make our music sound incredible and they deserve to be compensated. Even still, they both accept rates are much lower than the industry standard because they are devoted to getting our music heard. This cost also includes sending our mixes to a professional mastering engineer to offer a fresh perspective on the tracks and to fine tune any problem spots. </p>
<p><strong>Indiegogo Fees-$135</strong><br/>Indiegogo charges 5% off the top for providing a platform to host this campaign. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

<p>Misty Blues' next original recording project will be a mixture of musing and saucy creations. </p>
<p>Misty Blues: Band founder and lead singer, Gina Coleman, entered the music scene in the early 90’s as the lead singer of the folk/rock group Cole-Connection. It wasn’t until 1999 when she played a gospel singer in the Williamstown Theatre Festival production of A Raisin In The Sun that she was steered down the path of blues. The lead actor in the production, Rubin Santiago-Hudson, told Coleman that he felt her voice was well suited to sing classic blues. This sentiment was echoed by actor/singer, Mandy Patinkin, who sought her out after seeing the opening performance of the production. After actress Gwyneth Paltrow commented on her performance, Coleman knew a musical shift was imminent. Guitarist Jason Webster and bassist Bill Patriquin from Cole-Connection were on board and thus began Misty Blues. With a deficit of blues music in the Berkshires at the time, they felt the musical change would be well received. Misty Blues pays homage to the older blues made popular by the bold and brassy women of its time, while still paying respect to classic male artists of the 20’s, 30’s and 40’s. The band hasn’t completely abandoned their musical roots; they frequently perform classic rock and folk tunes infused with a healthy dose of the blues. Over the years, Misty Blues has produced three albums, Electric Juke Joint features classic blues renditions, Roadhouse Revival is a danceable twist on traditional gospel music, and Between The Stacks their completely original album with Charles Neville on sax. The core members are Gina Coleman, Jason Webster, Bill Patriquin, Jeff Dudziak, Benny Kohn and Rob Tatten. The band has been fortunate enough to perform with some great musicians in the Berkshires and beyond including Charles Neville, of the legendary Neville Brothers, Aaron Dean, Matt Berger, Dave Vittone and  Dan Teichert.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We invite you to jump on board with us and be part of this new album!</p>
<p>This new album tells the story of all the passages we went through as artists from the beginning until now. It touches upon the death and rebirth of an artist and how the music industry has been responsible for killing talented artists or in other words, forcing or convincing them to conform to the mainstream. <i>Death of the Artist</i> represents the side effects of what we went through being signed to a major label. </p>
<p><i>Death of the Artist</i>  is testament to fact that we are still standing and striving to make the best art we possibly can, on our terms. Our fans always give us the courage to continue this journey and play a big role on this album. They are officially part of this record with the song “The Motive"", where we invited a group of fans in the studio to sing with us and to record their voices for the chorus of the song.</p>
<p>We want this album to create an awakening and that it will be a strong source of inspiration for other artists to stay true to themselves and create inspiring art.</p>

His live performances in Philadelphia, New York, London, Los Angeles, &amp; Las Vegas, to mention a few, have earned him the admiration of many industry professionals, colleagues, and fans.  Lou’s recordings include: the road not taken, corner pocket, Shadows and Echoes, opening Doors: A Jazz Tribute to The Doors, and an intimate portrait in blue.  He was named the top male jazz vocalist of 2004 in the reader’s poll of Rio de Janeiro’s Tribuna da Imprensa for the album opening Doors.Lou is considered to be among the top 500 jazz vocalists of all time by noted jazz critic, historian, and author Scott Yanow and is listed as such in his book The Jazz Singers.  Several years ago featured the premiere of the original jazz opera, The Real Book of Gig, for which Lou penned the lyrics and libretto with composer Tony Gairo.  Jazz journalist Alex Henderson wrote in his review that “The November 2011 presentation of ‘The Real Book of Gig’ was a creative success for Lanza.”  Lou is currently working on several projects for release, most notably Scenes From An Italian, ajazz reworking of songs by Billy Joel.  He is also working on some sacred works as well as setting William Shakespeare's sonnets and poetry to music. In addition to his performing, teaching, and writing, Lou is a part of the Inspired Emotions Division at Brandywine Valley Talent.  It specializes in booking jazz, classical, world, and acoustic music.  Lou is a member of the music faculty at DeSales University for musical theatre vocal studies.  Lou is very appreciative to his family, friends, and most especially to his wife, Kelly, who shares his “crazy” life.</div></li>

<p>The
 Monday Blues Jazz Orchestra, founded in the late 1960's by employees of
 RCA's Astro-Electronics satellite division in East Windsor, NJ, has 
continuously entertained audiences with an ever-evolving mix of music up
 through the present day. Originally created as a place for amateur 
musicians to play and have fun, the Monday Blues Jazz Orchestra has 
grown to become one of the Northeast region’s premier musical 
attractions.</p>
<p>Today,
 the Monday Blues Jazz Orchestra delivers audiences a fresh mix of 
sounds comprised of classic big band jazz, popular standards, modern 
hits, favorites from the Great American Songbook, and the hottest rock, 
R&amp;B, and pop hits in a distinctly unique and modern style.</p>
<p>The
 20+ member band is comprised of some of the top instrumentalists and 
vocalists in the region (PA/NJ), whose members have performed with Wynton Marsalis, Peter Nero, Stevie Wonder, Fleetwood Mac, Burt Bacharach, Lew Soloff, Bill Watrous, Clark Terry, Hubert Laws, Doc Severinson, Arturo Sandoval, Stanley Clarke, Bobby Rydell, Al Martino, Stan Kenton, as well as many others.<br/></p>
<p>The Monday Blues Jazz Orchestra is definitely ""Not Your Grandparents' Big Band.""</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul> <li>We are teaming up to celebrate the music of one of the most influential entertainers of the 20th century through his music that never seems to find a generation gap.  The concert will take place in the theater at Gwynedd Mercy Academy High School on December 9th, 2015 at 8 PM.  Lou Lanza said that ""since the time I was old enough to remember, Frank Sinatra was a reality as I grew up.  His music provided a soundtrack to many important moments in my life.  Before I found jazz and started finding my own voice, he was there to point a way.""</li>
<li>By contributing, you will ensure that all of the musicians and technicians taking part in this concert will be paid a fair wage for their time, talents, and efforts as well as offsetting the costs of the theater rental.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p> <ul> <li>We need $3,000 to make this a night that we can not only be proud of musically, but that we can feel that we were compensated for talents and energies in making this once in a lifetime concert a reality.<br/>
</li> <li>If you contribute either $15 OR $10 (Senior Citizen/Student), you will receive a ticket to the concert at 8 PM on December 9th, 2015.  <br/>
</li>
<li>For $25 you will receive a ticket to the concert at 8 PM on December 9th, 2015 plus a personalized CD of Lou's.  <br/>
</li>
<li>For $35 you will receive a ticket to the concert at 8 PM on December 9th, 2015, a personalized CD of Lou's along with an autographed poster of the concert.</li>

</li>
<li>Theater rental, sound &amp; light technicians will cost about $800.  We will carry 18 musicians plus one vocalist that evening and we will receive the remainder of the $2,200 after indiegogo takes their cut.  That comes to about $110-$115 for not only the concert that evening, but also for the two rehearsals specifically geared towards this concert.  We are not asking for much as this is more a labor of love than anything else.  If we end up making more, it will still be spread evenly among the musicians and technicians after the up front costs are taken care of.<br/>

(Pre-tour show) LA: 11/29 - The Fox & Hounds ""Songwriter Sundays"" w/ Magenta Harley @ 9pmSan Jose: 11/30-12/3 - Kimo's hometown; digging into his roots Portland, OR: 12/4- Mississippi Pizza ""Girls Rock"" w/ Gabby Holt & Stephanie Scelza @ 6pm12/8 - Alberta St. Pub ""Night of Acoustic Soul"" w/ Honey Divers & Stephanie Scelza @ 9pmSeattle, WA:12/9 - The Royal Room ""Reunion Show"" w/ The Duo & Poon @7pm12/10 - The Rendezvous ""Raw & Emotional"" w/ Kye Alfred Hillig & Cloud Person @9pmMore ways to help:Even if money is not something you can give, there are other ways to help. You can share this link on your FB page, instagram, twitter...etc. Maybe even tell a few friends verbally about it!

</div></div>","Día 36¿Cuán lejos irías para alcanzar tus sueños?¿Alguna vez te sentiste fuera de lugar?¿Alguna vez sentiste que estabas viviendo una vida que no era la tuya?¿Cuántas veces te llamaron soñador? Mi madre cuenta que cuando mi hermano era tan solo un bebe y se acercaba a un enchufe, ella  a fin de protegerlo le decía “No”. Entonces, le golpeaba suavemente su mano y mi hermano se retiraba. En mi caso, mi madre cuenta  que cuando yo me acercaba gateando al enchufe, ella también me  decía “No” en un tono fuerte y autoritario y me golpeaba suavemente la mano. Sin embargo, a diferencia de mi hermano, yo volvía una y otra vez hacia el enchufe desoyendo la orden de mi madre y soportando el golpe. Finalmente, mi madre me tomaba en sus brazos y me llevaba a otra habitación para alejarme del enchufe ya que yo no dejaba de intentarlo. Algunas personas han dicho que nací sin instinto de conservación. Esta afirmación suele ser la preferida de las personas que tratan de entender como soy capaz de abandonarlo todo para ir detrás de mi sueño.  ¿Cómo ha sido mi vida en los últimos años? En esencia, he tratado de luchar por mis sueños:Le envié mi disco al CEO de Warner Music Group - Edgar Bronfman Junior 
Vendí todo lo que poseía, excepto mi guitarra y mi computador y me mude a Irlanda para intentar conseguir un record deal. Estando en Irlanda le pedí trabajo a U2 para aprender todo sobre el negocio de la música 36 Days To Work For U2

Sin embargo, a pesar de todo, NO LO LOGRÉ. Volví a mi país, Uruguay, con mis sueños rotos y absolutamente quebrado tanto emocional como económicamente. Me tomo 5 años recuperarme, y de hecho, siendo sincero aún sigo trabajando en amabas. Muy probablemente muchas personas pensarían que después de todo lo que pase, ya tendría que haber aprendido mi lección, y ya en este punto, lo más probable es que hubiera aceptado mi realidad, abandonado mis sueños, y simplemente hecho lo que la mayoría hace: buscar un trabajo de 8 horas. Pero resulta que nunca fui como la mayoría. Seis años después de mi primer intento, volví a pedirle trabajo a U2; y  esta vez me dirigí a  Bono:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i13mkUG2SA
Aún no he tenido respuesta. Los que realmente me conocen a fondo, saben que jamás voy a parar hasta alcanzar mi sueño. Que jamás voy a desistir y que después de todo lo que he vivido, estoy más decido que nunca a grabar mi disco “Day 36”. Es cierto…
Aun no soy conocido.
Aun no estoy en la radio.
Aun no toco en estadios. Por lo cual he decidido comenzar con lo más importante con lo que cuenta un músico: Con mi público. Ustedes son mi primer público.
Ustedes son mis primeras raíces.
Ustedes son las primeras plumas. Los necesito a USTEDES, mi público, para hacer cada vez más fuerte mi voz. Hoy… ahora… en este mismo momento, ustedes pueden contribuir y ser parte de esta historia única en el mundo. Hoy te pido a ti que me ayudes a grabar mi primer disco: Day 36. Te invito y te pido que seas parte de mi primer público. ¿Para qué necesito tu contribución? Con tu contribución estarás apoyando la creación, grabación, filmación y publicación de mi Disco Day 36 Day 36 - Mi Disco Day 36 es un disco, es una forma de vida y una forma de sentir.
Day 36 es una utopía y una realidad.
Day 36 es esa línea en el horizonte que nunca se alcanza pero que nos mantiene caminando.
Day 36 es mi disco, mi futura mujer, mis futuros hijos, mis amigos y mi música.
Day 36 es la última pieza que necesito para rearmare Músicos: Voz: Federico Revello (Uruguay)

<p>As Benedictine monks, we follow the ancient Rule of St. Benedict, meaning our lives are dedicated to prayer and work.  The joyful and beautiful celebration of the liturgy is at the heart of our mission, as it has been from our earliest days in Chicago a generation ago.</p>
<p>We sing traditional Gregorian chant in the Mass and Divine Office every day, and once a month we celebrate Solemn Vespers with our choral group, Schola Laudis, to incorporate masterworks of Renaissance polyphony.  Because we want to share the beauty of the Catholic liturgical tradition, we are asking for your help to raise $4,500 to complete our recording project.</p>
<p>The music for <strong>Mass for the Solemnity of the Ascension of Our Lord</strong> has already been recorded and includes a full setting of the Mass.  The mastering is almost done:  the project is in the final stage, but we need your help to raise $4,500 for the production costs.  This is the one last hurdle to clear before we can release the album!</p>
<p>All funds raised will go toward production costs.  As a monastic community, we live in poverty and take no salaries, supporting ourselves by our work and through the generosity of benefactors such as yourselves.  The funds will be used entirely for outside costs including manufacturing  the CD, producing the CD case, printing the liner notes, and setting up digital distribution.</p>
<p>No amount is too small—we are grateful for any help you can offer!</p>
<p>Although we live under the discipline of the cloister, our monastery is located in the shadow of downtown Chicago and we know that many people in our midst are beset by alienation and spiritual poverty.  Too often the city can be a modern “desert” whose inhabitants search for greater meaning and community.  The beauty of the Catholic liturgy addresses these needs.</p>
<p>We know the transformative power of beautiful traditional liturgy!</p>
<p>The celebration of the Mass and Divine Office is the central activity of our life, from which and around which everything else in our day receives its structure and meaning. We want to share that with you through this recording.</p>
<p>By helping us to complete <strong>Mass for the Solemnity of the Ascension of Our Lord</strong>, you will also be supporting our goal in founding Schola Laudis, which is to enrich the liturgical life of the Archdiocese of Chicago and to introduce more people to the beauty of the Catholic liturgical tradition.</p>
<p>The main challenge we face is meeting our target release date: the Solemnity of the Ascension Our Lord is fast approaching.  Although the music is timeless, it is our hope to share this album during the appropriate liturgical season this year!</p>
<p>If you are unable to offer a monetary donation, you can still help us! </p>
<p>Please like and share this campaign with your family and friends on social media—don't forget to use the Indiegogo share tools —and share it with others who love the liturgy and believe in its transformative power.  And please help us spread the word by any other means possible:  please direct those without social media to our website: <a href=""http://chicagomonk.org/schola-laudis/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://chicagomonk.org/schola-laudis/</a>.

If you are unable to offer a monetary donation, you can still help us! 
Please like and share this campaign with your family and friends on social media—don't forget to use the Indiegogo share tools —and share it with others who love the liturgy and believe in its transformative power.  And please help us spread the word by any other means possible:  please direct those without social media to our website: http://chicagomonk.org/schola-laudis/. Word of mouth helps too!
We are grateful for every effort!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>So, I'll Keep This Short...</h3>
<p>I'm Loona Dae, singer/songwriter and producer. Originally from St. Louis, MO, I now reside in Chicago, IL. After two years of constant growth in production, songwriting and finding myself creatively, I'm finally ready to put out a body of work I can honestly call my own. </p>
<p>You may know me from being apart of an all-female group called The Highness Collective, formerly known as SHE. We had a good run for about 5 years. It was great working with a team that pushed me to be smarter, creative and knowledgeable. We released two successful EP's together. That era has ended and we decided to part our ways and found it important to rediscover ourselves individually. </p>
<p>In the last two years of being with the group, I picked up producing; invested in equipment and software and taught myself how to produce my own music. Quirky, curious, and open-minded to the way my mind and ears flow, I found my creative self. Fearless. It's time to share this growth, my project, my baby, with the masses.</p>
<p>This is my true offering to the world. To not only be heard, but to help. Music heals. The world needs healing and I need your help in doing so. It is important to me to have all my ducks in a row when presenting my solo, debut body of work. This alone will legitimize my brand making it more accessible, professional, appealing and true to who I am. With only myself funding my project, and only so much time to work and split my attention between music and a day job, I have much work to do on the side of branding and post-production for this EP. I deserve the best. My supporters deserve the best, most polished version of my original art, ideas and performance.</p>
</div><div>This campaign will help fund publishing/digital distribution, website design, graphic design, merchandise (patches, shirts, stickers and pins), and visuals/videos (2).</div><div> </div><div>My project is set to release March 17th. I have good faith that my friends, family, and supporters will help make my visions a reality. </div><div> </div><div>Peace &amp; Light</div></div>","So, I'll Keep This Short...

</p><p>Philippi Music project (PMP) is a social project <b>started
in 2014</b> when Sibusiso Nyamakazi, a 24 year old writer, MC and musician
involved in several social upliftment projects in and around his community of Philippi met with students in social innovation from the University of Cape
Town.</p>
<p>We were stuck by the <b>energy and
the creativity of young artists in the townships</b>, <b>but dismayed by
the inexistence of structure to record it and promote it</b>.</p>
<p>From this need, Philippi Music Project was born with a simple an
efficient vision: to harvest and develop the creativity of local musicians,<b> to
offer them a platform where they can learn, produce and exchange, and
eventually connect this platform with the Cape Town Music ecosystem in order to bridge
the gap between Cape Town's wealthy centre and its townships.</b></p>

<div><b><span><br/></span></b></div>
<h3 style=""font-weight: bold;text-align: left;""><b>Part 1 : the music contest</b></h3>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">First we wanted to know more about these artists from the
townships. In 2014, we decided to organize <b>a music contest</b>. Our goal was to produce a compilation of these amazing musicians from the townships,
and to record it professionally.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460133719/0005_5_w1uznm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">
</p>
<p>But we wanted to do more than just just making an album, we wanted to provide skills using
music as a language to <b>get young artists involved in the process of creating,
managing and marketing a music product</b>.</p>
<p>Here is an interview of PMP on Cape Town TV in November 2014, when
we were promoting the music contest.</p>

<h3 style=""font-weight: bold;text-align: left;""><b>Part 2 : the studio</b></h3>
<p>At the beginning of 2015, we had already come up with this incredible compilation, ready to be recorded in a studio in Cape Town. This fueled our
spirits to <b>record this compilation in the townships and build a professional studio in Philippi</b>, for the long-term benefit of many aspiring
artists and not just for this compilation. We wanted to create a sustainable
social impact instead of a once-off album.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">
</p>
<p>So again, we actively went to <b>meet the artists from the townships</b>
participating in all the events, jam sessions and workshops in order to get to know them better,
<b>understand the way they work, what they need and what they lack</b>. </p>

</div>
</div><p></p></div>","Philippi Music project (PMP) is a social project started
in 2014 when Sibusiso Nyamakazi, a 24 year old writer, MC and musician
involved in several social upliftment projects in and around his community of Philippi met with students in social innovation from the University of Cape
Town.
We were stuck by the energy and
the creativity of young artists in the townships, but dismayed by
the inexistence of structure to record it and promote it.
From this need, Philippi Music Project was born with a simple an
efficient vision: to harvest and develop the creativity of local musicians, to
offer them a platform where they can learn, produce and exchange, and
eventually connect this platform with the Cape Town Music ecosystem in order to bridge
the gap between Cape Town's wealthy centre and its townships.



OUR STORY

Part 1 : the music contest
First we wanted to know more about these artists from the
townships. In 2014, we decided to organize a music contest. Our goal was to produce a compilation of these amazing musicians from the townships,
and to record it professionally.




But we wanted to do more than just just making an album, we wanted to provide skills using
music as a language to get young artists involved in the process of creating,
managing and marketing a music product.
Here is an interview of PMP on Cape Town TV in November 2014, when
we were promoting the music contest.

We received more than 100 submissions in one month and our contest
received a great media cover (TV, radio, shows), confirming the appetite for
such a project.

The promotion song of the music contest - Reclaiming the Bass




We gathered a jury of professionals from the music industry in Cape Town such as producers and label managers. In December 2014, these professionals selected ten artists to be part of the compilation, named Reclaiming the Bass.
Here is a short selection of artists featuring on the Reclaiming the Bass compilation







Part 2 : the studio
At the beginning of 2015, we had already come up with this incredible compilation, ready to be recorded in a studio in Cape Town. This fueled our
spirits to record this compilation in the townships and build a professional studio in Philippi, for the long-term benefit of many aspiring
artists and not just for this compilation. We wanted to create a sustainable
social impact instead of a once-off album.


So again, we actively went to meet the artists from the townships
participating in all the events, jam sessions and workshops in order to get to know them better,
understand the way they work, what they need and what they lack. 
PMP target specificities





In February 2016, we found a location for the recording studio, a 12 meter long container located in
a secured business hub called Philippi Village
The PMP studio location





We worked with a music studio designer and engineer to develop the
plan of the studio and the budget for soundproofing the container and investment costs for professional and adapted studio gear

The plan of the Philippi
Music Project Studio





Part 3 : the social
business
But more than just a studio, we want to build a platform that connects Cape Town 's music industry and creates meaningful interactions between musicians, record labels, streaming platforms, venues, media and so much more.

Workshops, conferences, concerts, recording sessions will make this place a
classroom to express creativity, connect people and learn from Music:

The PMP services




Through our platform and our services, we will impact the
townships sustainably by empowering musicians and bridging the gap between Cape
Town and its townships

The PMP yearly impact





Part 4 : You
Today, in April 2016
·  we have seriously talented artists
from the townships who want to use decent resources and learn through our
platform
·  we have a beautiful and
secure location in a business hub situated at the heart of the townships of
Cape Town
·  we have developed a
sustainable and social impacting venture
·  we have built a network of
technical and academic partners to facilitate workshops and link our platform
to the music industry
·  all we need to start and
make this happen is your support.

If you believe music has the power to bridge a social gap, to
create exchange, to empower people and to learn, then our project is yours






OUR NEED IN FUNDING





We need $18,000 to invest in all the professional gear needed for the studio (computer - mixer - mics - softwares - monitors - soundcards - cabling - furnitures...) and soundproof the container with basic materials such as firedoors, acoustic foan, drywall, neoprene...
What is the money for ?

</div></div>","Hello!
We are (Women's) Chamber Choir Sireen from Estonia and we're currently recording our first album ""Terra Incognita"". With your help we want to bring it to new audiences!
Who is Sireen?
Sireen (Estonian for Siren) comes from Estonia, a small country in Northern Europe, known for its long choral traditions and world-class choirs. It is also the birthplace of many great composers such as Arvo Pärt, Veljo Tormis, Tõnu Kõrvits and many more who have written some absolutely incredible choir music.
Sireen is a relatively new phenomenon in the Estonian choral scene. We are a group of 20 women, who came together five years ago under the lead of young conductors Tiiu Sinipalu and Ülle Tuisk with the aim to bring some fresh air to the music scene - by singing original music from new and talented Estonian composers and cooperating with local and international musicians from other genres.  In five years we have brought choral music to new audiences by giving joint performances with punk bands and electronic music groups during Tallinn Music Week, one of Europe's leading music festivals. And we have brought music to all corners of Estonia - concert halls, rocky beaches, warehouses, museums and churches.
This autumn for our fifth birthday we want to bring new Estonian choral music to wider audience, and to you. For this we are working on our debut album ""Terra Incognita"".
What kind of album is ""Terra Incognita""?Our very first album will be as diverse and limitless as we aim to be in the way we make music. Possibilities of choral music are endless and ""Terra Incognita"" will take you on a journey to these unknown lands. 
The album will have fresh original pieces from young and promising Estonian composers Sander Pehk and Maria Kõrvits, hauntingly beautiful music from acclaimed Estonian composers Tõnu Kõrvits, Lembit Veevo and choir classics from Eric Whitacre, Igor Stravinski, Knut Nystedt and more. The album will have altogether 19 tracks, including a special bonus track from our cooperation with Estonian electronic music duo Algorütmid. 
The quality of music and professional sound always remain a priority for us, that is why the album will be recorded and edited by true master Tanel Klesment, who has also worked on the albums of artists such as pianist Kristjan Randalu, renowned Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir, Estonian National Symphony Orchestra etc.Why we need your support and what you get in return?With our own funds we have already started the recording process in a lovely Estonian church that has just great acoustics! But we still need support to cover most of the production costs: the recording and mastering of 19 tracks, fees of instrumentalists (for recording pieces by Maria Kõrvits and Eric Whitacre), producing the album (design, booklet, printing the CDs etc). 
To cover these costs we aim to raise 3500$; and we know that together we can make it happen!Since until now our main audience has been from Estonia, we are simultaneously raising money in a local crowdfunding platform Hooandja. These funds are meant to cover the expenses of album release concerts and partly also the album -  supporters will receive our album in return. 

Therefore, even if we don't manage to raise the expected sum here, one way or another, we would find a way to finish the project and send all our Indiegogo supporters the promised perks! 

In return for your contribution we take you on a journey to quality Estonian choral music - either through a digital tracks or a CD. There are also some special perks, about which you can read on the right side. 
The impact
Your contribution will help us bring quality Estonian choral music to new audiences. And we hope that this could be the beginning of something great - maybe we will soon have the possibility of holding our release concerts also abroad and sing to you live. 
We highly appreciate any support. It would mean the world to us if you could spread the word about us and this project.  In case of any questions get in touch with us at kammernaiskoor@gmail.com or on our FB page Kammernaiskoor Sireen.With love,Sirens",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

Music has always been a big part of my life, however, at a certain time it was very difficult to make a living playing music so I had to keep it as a hobby while doing other jobs. The other jobs that I was doing were great, but my passion for music was even greater so after 7 years of working as a recruiter I decided to quit and follow my passion that started when I was 14 years old. </p><p>I saved up some money to sustain myself financially and I am dedicating all of my time and efforts to develop a successful YouTube channel. This includes hours of daily practice and composing plus recording of video material and building an online guitar course.</p><p>My goal is<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> to create a successful YouTube channel where anyone who wants to learn how to play guitar at their best would be able to receive invaluable information for FREE. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;""> </span></p><p>The guitar course which I'm planning to release is different from others since I not only talk about efficient guitar practice, but also how to take care of your body while playing guitar which is extremely important if you want to play long term! Also I talk about how to break negative emotional and psychological patterns that were instilled in many of us and which often lead us to believe that we're not good enough or just don't have the music in us and as a result we tend to give up. I personally gave up on guitar several times, but I still found the will, desire and motivation to keep on playing and achieving results.

Music has always been a big part of my life, however, at a certain time it was very difficult to make a living playing music so I had to keep it as a hobby while doing other jobs. The other jobs that I was doing were great, but my passion for music was even greater so after 7 years of working as a recruiter I decided to quit and follow my passion that started when I was 14 years old. I saved up some money to sustain myself financially and I am dedicating all of my time and efforts to develop a successful YouTube channel. This includes hours of daily practice and composing plus recording of video material and building an online guitar course.My goal is to create a successful YouTube channel where anyone who wants to learn how to play guitar at their best would be able to receive invaluable information for FREE.  The guitar course which I'm planning to release is different from others since I not only talk about efficient guitar practice, but also how to take care of your body while playing guitar which is extremely important if you want to play long term! Also I talk about how to break negative emotional and psychological patterns that were instilled in many of us and which often lead us to believe that we're not good enough or just don't have the music in us and as a result we tend to give up. I personally gave up on guitar several times, but I still found the will, desire and motivation to keep on playing and achieving results. So can YOU if music is your passion!In addition, I already have a cover section of other artists on my channel as well as I'm planning to create my own original album that will be available for everyone.My ultimate goal is to create a successful YouTube channel that will help others and support me financially. Obviously, to create a successful YouTube Channel takes time, dedication and money. There are costs involved in production of videos, marketing, recording, software, hardware, instruments and gear.That is why I'm asking for your support that will help me stay focused on my dream 100% of the time while producing high-quality musical content for you guys.I've already tried music as a hobby while working at other jobs. Whereas, I did achieve some level of success in music it is far beyond from the success I envision which would help thousands if not millions of people to learn how to play the instrument efficiently and far more importantly not to give up on their dream!If what I just told you resonates with you then click on the link you see on your screen and support my project with the amount that you feel is reasonable.In addition, I would like to ask you to please share this video within your network (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.) to make this project visible.I'm really passionate about this project and I hope you feel the sameThank you for your support. See you guys later :)???????????:?????? ????,

Oneness with the earth, the fertility, the soul and what connects us and gives life. The occult, light / dark, eroticism and the mystic.</div>

<p><b>Sleeping Arrangements</b> </p>
<p><b>Food / Drink </b></p>
<p><b>Total Costs</b>  €5000</p>
<p>We will be investing €2500 out of our own reserves and looking to reach raising funds for €2500 of the remaining costs. We have chosen to use the Flexible Funding option which will make the project go through even if the goal isn't reached, we will improve on the budget or raise the remaining via other means. But, one thing is sure, this project is GO!</p>
<p>We plan to shoot mid August 2016 and have the film/clip finished in the fall of 2016. The clip will be part of forthcoming debut album release. Completing the audio and visual concept of the album.</p>
<p>If we manage to raise more than needed, the extra will either go towards extra costs for the shoot, like extra accessories, lighting, etc or it will be placed as a reserve for the second shoot of the project. And if we raise even more, it will go towards the extras for the debut album : mastering, artwork, photoshoot, etc.</p>We've tried to be as creative as possible with the perks, but also straight forward by not going to much overboard, especially concerning perks with shipping costs, because i would prefer you don'<span style=""background-color: initial;"">t lose a chunk of money towards shipping costs which would be better if they would go directly to help this project.</span>

</div><div>
<p>What we are planning to do with this project is to create a new dimension of creative magic by going the extra mile to make this audiovisual project stand out from the vast majority of stuff out there. </p>
<p>Mysticism and the occult have always been a big inspiration to this and my previous projects, after extensive research into all kinds of subjects ranging from pre-history, ancient cultures, sacred geometry, ancient symbolism, goddess worship, polytheism, the occult, shamanism, etc, etc... We have done months of research to create a concept which is timeless, but also is backed up with occurrences and facts which have become lost to many as they have been put away into the shadows. </p>
<p>People who love my previous work and magical worlds like The Kilimanjaro Darkjazz Ensemble 'Here Be Dragons' or The Mount Fuji Doomjazz Corporations 'Succubus' this will be an even deeper dive into unknown mystical territories. And i hope you have the faith to support and fund this project to push it to a new level creatively.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are no risks or challenges. We as a team have decided that this project must be done. However long, the dedication and passion is limitless and relentless.</p>

As you may know, I started a new darkjazz project 'The Thing With Five Eyes' after the split of The Kilimanjaro Darkjazz Ensemble in 2012/13. The creative journey for me was still unfinished and i found the need to continue this magical and mystical path. 

What we are funding is the first in a series of videoclips / short films which will be expanding this universe musically and visually. A goal which we have had since starting this project and a creative urge to create something passionate and timeless, something we can pour my heart into, and hopefully be inspiring to others.
Video productions are expensive, unfortunately, and even for just getting the basics covered we have had to create this platform to help fund this concept. 
So, hopefully we can get you excited to support us in starting the creation of this new universe!
The clip will be filmed by award winning Dutch filmer Andres Fouché. Well known for his amazing clips for De Staat (Torre Florim) and Dope DOD.
'Glory' The Thing With Five Eyes. Debut release.

 
The Priestess

 


In an unknown time and civilisation a nomad woman experiences the magical and mystical ritual of creation.
This is the synopsis to our story. It will be the first part in the series of this tale. In an unknown era on our planet, we show the female, the priestess, the life-giver performing lost rituals of mysticism and magic. Oneness with the earth, the fertility, the soul and what connects us and gives life. The occult, light / dark, eroticism and the mystic.
The rest of the story remains a mystery of course... and will unfold in time to come!
 

Atoms & Protons

 


The bits and pieces needed to finance this project. Breaking it down as to be completely transparent so you can see exactly what is needed and where the money for the production is going to :
 
Cameraman, Editing, Post-Production
Actors
 
Production / Light / Make Up Crew 
 
Clothing, Accessories, Make-up
 
Film Rental Material (Lighting, dry ice machine, generator, etc)  
 
Travel costs (Bus rental, petrol, insurance, toll)
Sleeping Arrangements 
Food / Drink 
Total Costs  €5000
We will be investing €2500 out of our own reserves and looking to reach raising funds for €2500 of the remaining costs. We have chosen to use the Flexible Funding option which will make the project go through even if the goal isn't reached, we will improve on the budget or raise the remaining via other means. But, one thing is sure, this project is GO!
We plan to shoot mid August 2016 and have the film/clip finished in the fall of 2016. The clip will be part of forthcoming debut album release. Completing the audio and visual concept of the album.
If we manage to raise more than needed, the extra will either go towards extra costs for the shoot, like extra accessories, lighting, etc or it will be placed as a reserve for the second shoot of the project. And if we raise even more, it will go towards the extras for the debut album : mastering, artwork, photoshoot, etc.We've tried to be as creative as possible with the perks, but also straight forward by not going to much overboard, especially concerning perks with shipping costs, because i would prefer you don't lose a chunk of money towards shipping costs which would be better if they would go directly to help this project.
There's some great perks in there, and anything you decide to fund will be amazing! The Impact
 


What we are planning to do with this project is to create a new dimension of creative magic by going the extra mile to make this audiovisual project stand out from the vast majority of stuff out there. 
Mysticism and the occult have always been a big inspiration to this and my previous projects, after extensive research into all kinds of subjects ranging from pre-history, ancient cultures, sacred geometry, ancient symbolism, goddess worship, polytheism, the occult, shamanism, etc, etc... We have done months of research to create a concept which is timeless, but also is backed up with occurrences and facts which have become lost to many as they have been put away into the shadows. 
People who love my previous work and magical worlds like The Kilimanjaro Darkjazz Ensemble 'Here Be Dragons' or The Mount Fuji Doomjazz Corporations 'Succubus' this will be an even deeper dive into unknown mystical territories. And i hope you have the faith to support and fund this project to push it to a new level creatively.


Risks & Challenges
There are no risks or challenges. We as a team have decided that this project must be done. However long, the dedication and passion is limitless and relentless.
IT SHALL BE DONE.

<h3>Festival Summary</h3>
<p>The Spontaneous Combustion New Music Festival was born from my passion for contemporary classical music, and the incredibly talented and dedicated musicians who perform it. My goals for the festival:</p>
<p>1) to help bring innovative artists and programming to the west coast to help further their career and share their gift with new audiences</p>
<p>2) to reach new audiences and cultivate an awareness and appreciation for this art form</p>
<p>3) to contribute towards the community of like-minded individuals who are passionate about contemporary classical music.</p>
<p>Spontaneous Combustion is a unique model for a new music festival. Most festivals are located in one city. The 7 featured artists will perform in 10 cities: <strong>Seattle</strong><strong>, Portland, Eugene, Sacramento, San Jose, San Francisco, Ojai, Palm Springs, San Diego and Los Angeles. </strong>(Cities subject to change)</p>
<p>In other words, each artist has a 10 city tour, while each city hosts 7 concerts!</p>
<p>Along the way, the artists will have many opportunities to give master classes at nearby universities and community music programs.</p>
<p>The festival is schedule for <strong>Jan / Feb 2018.</strong></p>
<p>These are the currently confirmed performers for the festival:</p>

<p>If I could fund this festival myself out-of-pocket, believe me, I would. Since I am not independently wealthy, I am trying to raise start-up funds in a variety of ways, one of them being this Indie Go-Go campaign.</p>
<p>Eventually, I am hoping to be able to raise enough funds through advertising, ticket sales, and grants to cover expenses. But most of those funds won't be available until closer to the festival dates. Before I can move forward with the festival, I need to pay for certain things, mainly:</p>
<p>Liability insurance for venues that don't have it,</p>
<p>Rental deposits for some of the venues,</p>
<p>Performance fee deposits (some of the performers require this not only as an act of good faith on my part, but to secure them for the festival)</p>
<p>Start up expenses and other related business expenses. This includes design work, bank account fees, web hosting - smaller fees that add up.</p>
<p>I have already paid out-of-pocket for the business start up expenses.</p>
<h3>SUPPORTING THIS CAUSE</h3>
<p>I realize that many of you do not live on the west coast, and will not be able to attend these concerts. But maybe you will support the cause because you are passionate like I am about new music and you want to help it succeed. Whatever your reason, thanks for your support!</p>
<p>Most of these types of campaigns have tangible perks that can be offered. Since this campaign is raising seed capital, there is little I can offer or guarantee as a perk other than thank yous in the programs and tickets to the festival. These tickets can be transferred so in case you can't attend personally, you can designate them to a friend who may be interested.</p>
<p>If you purchase a single ticket, 3-day festival pass, or 7-day festival pass as a perk, you can select the dates and locations closer to the actual concert dates (again late January / early February 2018).</p>
<p>If you own a business, or know somebody who does, you can receive reduced-rate advertising as a perk. Regional ads are for just one city (whichever you choose) while national ads will be displayed in all 10 city programs (for a total of 70 concerts!)</p>
<p>Choose from 1/4 page, 1/2 page and full page ads, which are full color. Your logo will also be displayed on our website as a corporate donor.</p>

<h3>YOUR SUPPORT WILL...</h3>
<p>--Help these amazing musicians to share their craft and reach new audiences</p>
<p>--Bring these talented musicians to the west coast (in the winter!) to 10 different communities</p>
<p>--Help foster an appreciation for the art music of our time</p>
<p>--Help bring recognition to many amazing up-and-coming composers as well as masters of our time</p>

Remind us all to keep what happened in our thoughts and continue to work towards peaceful solutions.  
Honor Andy by giving to something that he loved.  
DONATE*All Donations, including signed albums, were made directly to this benefit.  Please support these people, companies and artists whenever possible!All proceeds will go directly to the music program at Lawrence Cook School where Andy attended. The donation will be made in Andy's name.  You can help us reach our goal several ways:
Purchase a ticket and attend the event
Purchase one of our donation items
Make a donation directly to the cause
Any combination of the above
All donations are through our sponsor KWTF Radio 501(c) #45-5041405 charitable organization.  Your support is tax-deductible MUSIC  April 4th at ARLENE FRANCIS CENTER - SANTA ROSA, CA

</div><h3></h3><p></p><h1 style=""text-align: center;"">The Impact</h1><p>I truly believe that my purpose is much deeper than music.  It is to inspire people to identify their Godly purpose and motivate them to follow through by faith and action to see that every promise that God has given is manifested in the present reality. It is my hope that my blend of Jazz Harmonies, R&amp;B, and Contemporary Gospel, are refreshing to the ear and soothing to the soul.  My mission statement is “to break down barriers in people’s minds bringing them closer to the presence of God in order to bring restoration, new direction, and motivation”.</p><p></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks and Challenges</h3><div>
<p>The are always risks and challenges that come with a faith project.  However:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>When God gives a gift it is meant for sharing.<br/>
</li>
<li> When God gives a vision there is provision.  <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I believe many times we do not realize our full-potential because we look at perceived limitations.  However, we must look to our King and know that the potential he has placed within us is only limited by our perceptions.  </span></p>

My name is Shanti Chapman.  I am a Christian/Gospel Music Artist.   I have a strong passion to see the many songs that God has blessed me to write over the years come to life.       
                                                                     Listen here:
                                            Now is the Season - by Shanti Chapman

I had the privilege to connect with Randy Bowen, Editor of Live It Loud Magazine, a few months ago when discussing an advertising opportunity with the magazine.                                                                                                                                                                      


A couple months later, we discussed the opportunity of coming to Nashville to work with him and Grammy Award Winning Producer Tre' Corley on my 2015 project. This was a very timely conversation because I was praying and believing that God   would open the door to connect with the right industry professionals to record my project. 
           


                                                             The Goal 
My goal is to raise the funds necessary to record a full-length album with Randy Bowen and Tre' Corley at Oak Tree Studios with the best of the best musicians, singers, and engineers. 

We agreed upon a budget of $17000 to cover the cost of:

Full-Length Album (8-10 songs)
Top Notch Producers and Engineers
World Class Studio
Best of the Best Musicians and Singers
Promotional Photo Shoot
Administrative Expenses


                            


   The Benefits of the Artist Incurring these Expenses:

The Artist Owns the Master Recording
Expenses Won't be Recouped Later (Like Many Record Labels Do)
The Fans/Supporters can participate in the Artist's Growth and Success
         
The ImpactI truly believe that my purpose is much deeper than music.  It is to inspire people to identify their Godly purpose and motivate them to follow through by faith and action to see that every promise that God has given is manifested in the present reality. It is my hope that my blend of Jazz Harmonies, R&B, and Contemporary Gospel, are refreshing to the ear and soothing to the soul.  My mission statement is “to break down barriers in people’s minds bringing them closer to the presence of God in order to bring restoration, new direction, and motivation”.Risks and Challenges
The are always risks and challenges that come with a faith project.  However:


When God gives a gift it is meant for sharing.

 When God gives a vision there is provision.  


I believe many times we do not realize our full-potential because we look at perceived limitations.  However, we must look to our King and know that the potential he has placed within us is only limited by our perceptions.

<div>To all my Friends, Family, &amp; Fans;</div>
<div>As most of you know, I have been working on my music for the past decade - more behind the scenes writing, pre-production, and small performances than anything.  Well, the time has finally come for me to begin my artistic journey on stage in front of live audiences across the nation and around the world. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>It's not easy to ask for help, so I'll give it my best. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>To everyone who has been there for me as an ear or for mental support when times have been tough, I want to thank you form the bottom of my heart. Over the years so many people have kindly offered, ""If you need help, or if there is anything I can do, please let me know"".  For the first time I humbly come to you asking for that help in making my dreams a reality! </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>It takes a good financial push to get the ball rolling and fortunately, I am already peaking international interest!!!  Currently I am booked on a 3 month tour of the People's Republic of China starting next month! Having the video and single finalized will create more promotional opportunities for future tours and live promotions.</div>
<div>
<span><br/></span>All that's missing is the music and the visual to be released quickly and precisely to better coincide with the opportunities coming through.  As an independent artist, there is the reality of a need for start up funds when it comes to promotion.  Who better to ask for help than you?…the people who have shown support all along! </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>This campaign will assist in covering costs for the music video and post production on the music (single as well as other songs on the full length EP). </div>
<div><br/></div>

are nearing the end of the recording process and we need your help! As 
some of you know recording music, mixing and mastering the songs, 
pressing and distributing the final product is an expensive process that
 requires a lot of love and hard work! Our band needs to finish this EP 
in order to supply you with our newest tracks, so we decided to reach 
out to you guys for a financial push to wrap this up. <p>If
 we raise enough money we will be able to finish our 4 song EP, release 
it digitally and on CDs, print T-shirts, shoot a low-budget music video 
and keep on rocking like we are born to do! Your donations will help 
tremendously; even if it is just a few bucks or something more generous 
and substantial. ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING WILL HELP US!!!</p>
<p>In
 return for your generosity (depending on the amount you donate), we 
will supply you with a digital download of our new EP, T-shirts, 
stickers, and more, but we have to reach our goal!</p>

are nearing the end of the recording process and we need your help! As 
some of you know recording music, mixing and mastering the songs, 
pressing and distributing the final product is an expensive process that

 we raise enough money we will be able to finish our 4 song EP, release 
it digitally and on CDs, print T-shirts, shoot a low-budget music video 
and keep on rocking like we are born to do! Your donations will help

the birthplace of Confederation in Canada.  



Cultural events such as our concerts engage and attract
professionals, businesses and educated audiences to our Island and our economy.


Our audiences experience the incredible power and beauty of
live orchestral music four times a season.


Our $170K annual budget is primarily used to purchase
supplies and services right here in PEI, reinvesting in our local economy.


Four times per year we book twenty five hotel rooms for a
full weekend for our travelling musicians.


Every concert attracts off-island tourism.


Charlottetown restaurants are busy during each of our four
concert weekends.


Professional PEI musicians have the opportunity to perform
with a full orchestra.


Young PEI student musicians have the opportunity to perform
with an orchestra, as regular members and/or soloists.


Islanders experience talented guest soloists and our guest
soloists experience the orchestra and our Island community.


Established PEI solo artists and groups have an opportunity
to perform with a full live orchestra.


Island popular music artists and groups can have their
music arranged for orchestra for other engagements outside of PEI.

When the opportunity came to collaborate with the Ojai Youth Symphony and a select group of local professional musicians, I embraced the challenge. <span>The Suite tells the

<h3>WHAT YOU GET (i.e., The Perks!)</h3> <p></p>
</div>You can view the perks on the right, but here’s some more information - <br/><br/>The $15-$25 and $45 levels are pre-order levels. If you know you are going to want our next album(s), you can pre-order it through the campaign. The CDs will have a full-color picture on the disc, and a single two-sided insert in the front of the case.  We’ll be putting as much information as will fit on the inside of the insert.<br/><br/>The House Concert level will get you a ticket that will let you and a guest see a house concert featuring Apryl Knight or Tulstin Troubadours.  We haven’t set an exact location for the concerts yet, though we have some ideas.  If we end up with a majority of contributors to this level who are all in the same area, we’ll do our best to schedule a house concert in that area.  If you contribute to the House Concert level and the concert ends up being too far away from you, you will get an exclusive invitation to view the concert on Concert Window, which is an awesome online concert platform where you can both see the concert and type your comments and requests directly to us.<br/><br/>As to the Hedgehog Dance Video levels - our mascots, Hedgie and Buttercup, have been itching to make a dance video for quite a while, and will be filming a dance video that will be sent to all of the contributors at these levels.  They will personally thank you at the end of the video if you contribute at the Personalized Video level.<br/><br/>The Dance Book level ($60) is a great perk for SCA musicians or dance group leaders, or for anyone who wants sheet music with new arrangements of dance tunes.  The book will be spiral bound (so it will lay flat), and will have a clear plastic front and back cover.<br/><br/>The $150 level is designed for SCA dance groups who want to have a different version of one of the songs on the “Dance The Knight Away” CD.  If you’re wondering if this level is right for you, contact Apryl Knight to find out the specifics of the song structure of the planned songs.  We can discuss your group’s specific needs.<br/><br/><h3>WHERE THE MONEY GOES</h3><br/>$4,000 will go to Tree Leom to record the two CDs ($2,000 per CD).<br/><br/><i>What if we get less than anticipated?</i><br/>We’ll use all of the money received to pay for recording costs, and do the best we can to pay for the remaining amount (which could possibly delay the release of the albums.)<br/><br/><i>What if we get more than anticipated?</i><br/>Extra money above the $4,000 will go towards professional mastering of the CDs.  If we get more than we need for recording and mastering, then we can entertain the idea of getting fancier CDs with actual printed multi-page booklets.<br/><br/><h3>WANT TO KEEP TRACK OF OUR PROGRESS?</h3><br/>Regular updates, musings, and random outbursts will be posted on our Facebook Pages -<br/><a href=""Apryl%20Knight's%20Facebook%20Page"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/AprylKnightMusician"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Apryl Knight's Facebook Page</a><br/><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/TulstinTroubadours"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tulstin Troubadours' Facebook Page</a><br/><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/HedgieOfTulstinTroubadours"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hedgie's Facebook Page</a><br/><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ButtercupOfTulstinTroubadours"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Buttercup's Facebook Page</a><br/><br/>and on Twitter - <br/><a href=""https://twitter.com/apryl_knight"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://twitter.com/apryl_knight"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">@apryl_knight</a><br/><a href=""https://twitter.com/t_troubadours"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">@t_troubadours</a><br/><br/><br/><h3>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP - </h3>1) Pledge early!

<p>First and foremost, we dedicate ourselves to spreading the name of Jesus Christ and sharing testimonies of salvation through the singing and playing of Gospel music. We believe the performance of Gospel Music to be a ministry that knows no boundaries such as denomination, race, financial or personal prejudice. Gospel music is a means for us to praise, spread the name of Jesus Christ and win the lost for Kingdom of God</p>
<p>Second, this organization is dedicated to serve the nations. To sponsor singing concerts and events which promote Gospel Music. We will share positive experiences, training, support and prayer for each member of the ministry</p>
<p>The Heirs of Harmony is a registered and recognized non-profit organization, working together to support and promote gospel music internationally in order to uplift each other and our Savior Jesus Christ and to win souls for Him.</p>
<b>What We Need &amp; What You Get </b>
</div><div>
<p></p>The Heirs of Harmony we would 
like to solicit your assistance in helping us raise $2500 in phase 1 of our $25,000 goal to purchase 
vans in support of our Transportation Ministry. These vans will 
serve to accommodate our traveling ministry and also provide to seniors 
in need of transportation to Doctor's appointments, grocery stores, etc.
  </div> <div>
<b>The Impact </b><br/><i><br/></i>With your help, our vision to reach the lost and tearing down the walls of religion and 
tradition will come into fruition. Our Transportation Ministry will serve as one of the major 
vehicles of this vision, seeking to service those that lack transportation, as well as seek out those 
persons residing in retirement homes &amp; communities, homeless 
shelters, transitional housing and elsewhere within the boarders of Grand Rapids, Michigan who are undeserved and who would benefit from the availability of the vans.  They will never sit idle in between our ministry trips. They will always be put to good use, helping others in need. <br/><span></span><br/><p>Even
 though we are a religious institution focusing on inspiring people through the gospel, we also believe strongly in reaching <i>outside our circle </i>by extending a helping hand to those that are in need with our 
""feed-a-family"" program and supporting our community at large by 
building awareness in education, violence, domestic abuse, and linking 
these families to community services.  We are happy to say that The Heirs of Harmony do more than just sing. </p>

We believe the performance of Gospel Music to be a ministry that knows no boundaries such as denomination, race, financial or personal prejudice. Gospel music is a means for us to praise, spread the name of Jesus Christ and win the lost for Kingdom of God
Second, this organization is dedicated to serve the nations. To sponsor singing concerts and events which promote Gospel Music. We will share positive experiences, training, support and prayer for each member of the ministry
The Heirs of Harmony is a registered and recognized non-profit organization, working together to support and promote gospel music internationally in order to uplift each other and our Savior Jesus Christ and to win souls for Him.
What We Need & What You Get 

The Heirs of Harmony we would 
like to solicit your assistance in helping us raise $2500 in phase 1 of our $25,000 goal to purchase 
vans in support of our Transportation Ministry. These vans will 
serve to accommodate our traveling ministry and also provide to seniors 
in need of transportation to Doctor's appointments, grocery stores, etc.
   
The Impact With your help, our vision to reach the lost and tearing down the walls of religion and 
tradition will come into fruition. Our Transportation Ministry will serve as one of the major 
vehicles of this vision, seeking to service those that lack transportation, as well as seek out those 
persons residing in retirement homes & communities, homeless 
shelters, transitional housing and elsewhere within the boarders of Grand Rapids, Michigan who are undeserved and who would benefit from the availability of the vans.  They will never sit idle in between our ministry trips. They will always be put to good use, helping others in need. Even
 though we are a religious institution focusing on inspiring people through the gospel, we also believe strongly in reaching outside our circle by extending a helping hand to those that are in need with our 
""feed-a-family"" program and supporting our community at large by 
building awareness in education, violence, domestic abuse, and linking 
these families to community services.  We are happy to say that The Heirs of Harmony do more than just sing. 

Other Ways You Can Help We understand that some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:  Help us get the word out by telling your friends and family about our campaign or even posting the campaign on your social media pages. Feel free to use the share tools available through this website.
 Most importantly, continue to pray for our efforts and our ministry.

<div>The Detroit Medical Orchestra is excited to showcase the Detroit fine arts community in an exciting performance of Stravinsky's Firebird Suite on May 3, 2015. This free concert will be a collaboration between the orchestra and local dancers and visual artists to provide a fantastic immersive experience into the magical world of the iconic Firebird. </div>
<div>In order to bring this project to its pinnacle of musical expression, we are enhancing the experience with stage props and set design that will interact with the orchestra while it plays. We are also involving professional dancers and a director and choreographer to coordinate the visual aspect of the performance.<b> Props, set design, costumes, professional artists, and stage personnel all require financial support, so the Detroit Medical Orchestra needs your help!</b> Please donate today and come to our performance at 4pm on May 3, 2015 at the Ford Auditorium located in the Detroit School of Arts. </div>
<div>Donors will be honored in our concert program and on promotional materials. The Detroit Medical Orchestra is a recognized 501(c)(3) non-profit Private Foundation, so all donations are tax-deductible. EIN <span>45-3183266.</span>

<h3>More about the orchestra and this project</h3>
<div>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Since our beginning in 2009, the DMO’s mission to “bring
healing through music” has been realized by 
presenting high-level classical concert performances in the heart of
downtown Detroit performed by Detroit-area medical professionals – medical
students, nurses, resident and attending physicians, and professionals from
other health-allied fields. As such, there is no other community orchestra like
the DMO in Michigan. The DMO performances have reached thousands of
appreciative concert-goers. Concert donations benefit several central Detroit
health and social initiatives such as the Robert R. Frank Student-Run Free Clinic,
Cass Community Clinic, The Horizons Project and Clinic, the Detroit School of
Arts, and others.  The orchestra members
are all volunteers, giving generously of their time and extraordinary talent.</span><br/>
</div>
</div><div>
<h3>
</h3>
<p>And now the DMO has proudly announced its most ambitious and
exciting concert program ever: the monumental ballet and orchestral concert
work <b><i>The
Firebird</i></b> by Igor Stravinsky. The performance will produced
by a highly-respected director and choreographer and will feature professional
ballet soloists as well as dance students from Wayne State University and students from the Detroit School of Arts. High-energy rehearsals are going on
now for this May 2015 performance. We have never done anything like this before
and we can’t wait!</p>
<p><b>Creating a performance like this requires costumes, props, set design, and experienced stage personnel, and we believe strongly in paying guest artists for their work. </b>So as you can imagine, the DMO is going pretty far out on a
financial limb here – and that’s why we are calling on your support in this
special way. We are counting on the
same source of strong support that we’ve always had: many kind, generous
contributors who appreciate the work we do. We have always managed our funds
very carefully – and this concert is no different – but this time we need just
a little bit more!  <b>By April 1, we hope
to have raised $10,000 to cover the concert expenses.  </b></p>
<p>And in keeping with our mission, all of the costumes and
props together with a portion of donations accepted at the concert will be donated to the
Detroit School of Arts to enhance the very fine programs of art development
available for talented Detroit youth.  </p>
<p>As always, as a DMO supporter you can be assured that:</p>

The Detroit Medical Orchestra is excited to showcase the Detroit fine arts community in an exciting performance of Stravinsky's Firebird Suite on May 3, 2015. This free concert will be a collaboration between the orchestra and local dancers and visual artists to provide a fantastic immersive experience into the magical world of the iconic Firebird. 
In order to bring this project to its pinnacle of musical expression, we are enhancing the experience with stage props and set design that will interact with the orchestra while it plays. We are also involving professional dancers and a director and choreographer to coordinate the visual aspect of the performance. Props, set design, costumes, professional artists, and stage personnel all require financial support, so the Detroit Medical Orchestra needs your help! Please donate today and come to our performance at 4pm on May 3, 2015 at the Ford Auditorium located in the Detroit School of Arts. 
Donors will be honored in our concert program and on promotional materials. The Detroit Medical Orchestra is a recognized 501(c)(3) non-profit Private Foundation, so all donations are tax-deductible. EIN 45-3183266.

More about the orchestra and this project

Since our beginning in 2009, the DMO’s mission to “bring
healing through music” has been realized by 
presenting high-level classical concert performances in the heart of
downtown Detroit performed by Detroit-area medical professionals – medical
students, nurses, resident and attending physicians, and professionals from
other health-allied fields. As such, there is no other community orchestra like
the DMO in Michigan. The DMO performances have reached thousands of
appreciative concert-goers. Concert donations benefit several central Detroit
health and social initiatives such as the Robert R. Frank Student-Run Free Clinic,
Cass Community Clinic, The Horizons Project and Clinic, the Detroit School of
Arts, and others.  The orchestra members
are all volunteers, giving generously of their time and extraordinary talent.




And now the DMO has proudly announced its most ambitious and
exciting concert program ever: the monumental ballet and orchestral concert
work The
Firebird by Igor Stravinsky. The performance will produced
by a highly-respected director and choreographer and will feature professional
ballet soloists as well as dance students from Wayne State University and students from the Detroit School of Arts. High-energy rehearsals are going on
now for this May 2015 performance. We have never done anything like this before
and we can’t wait!
Creating a performance like this requires costumes, props, set design, and experienced stage personnel, and we believe strongly in paying guest artists for their work. So as you can imagine, the DMO is going pretty far out on a
financial limb here – and that’s why we are calling on your support in this
special way. We are counting on the
same source of strong support that we’ve always had: many kind, generous
contributors who appreciate the work we do. We have always managed our funds
very carefully – and this concert is no different – but this time we need just
a little bit more!  By April 1, we hope
to have raised $10,000 to cover the concert expenses.  
And in keeping with our mission, all of the costumes and
props together with a portion of donations accepted at the concert will be donated to the
Detroit School of Arts to enhance the very fine programs of art development
available for talented Detroit youth.  
As always, as a DMO supporter you can be assured that:



All your contributions stay local and directly
benefit City of Detroit and nearby citizens and their charitable causes


Your gifts add to the gifts that the members of
the orchestra also generously provide (besides their talent and time!)


Your DMO will continue to provide free public access to the people of
Detroit to enjoy some of the world’s finest classical music


I truly hope that you will join our orchestra as we continue
to strive towards bringing healing through music. 
Sincerely yours, 
YoungKey

<div>3 years ago, 3 guys: Brent, Jarrett, and Thom set out to create a place that musicians and bands in the Long Beach, Orange County, and LA area could come with their imagination, talent, and creativity and make and record music. Unfortunately, we lost one (Thom) along the way but two of us remained and persevered. We had the idea of a place without pretense, stuffiness, or music snobbery but a notion that if you had a couple songs or a full album and wanted to preserve it forever, you could come here and we'd help you realize that dream. </div>
<div>A lot of really talented people have been to our little spot and together we've put a lot of good music out into the world. Including bands like:</div>
<div>Sister Crowley, Northern Youth, Yukon Gold, Adam Fight, Kyle Michael Neal, We are Traitors, and many more.....and we would like to keep putting out great music with better and better recording tone and quality.</div>

</div>
</div><div> <p>Recently, as we are remodeling, upgrading, and improving and have run into some costly issues. We have learned that there are some electrical problems that are causing surges and ruining some expensive recording equipment, not to mention generating a noticeable amount of interference during recording. This issue can and will be rectified, however with a hefty cost. This is unfortunately cutting into our operating and improvement budget and therefore we are asking that our friends and supporters help us continue offering the best possible recordings for artists and bands that don't have tens of thousands of dollars to record at major recording studios in Hollywood.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>We feel that we contribute the city of Long Beach and the surrounding areas in quite a few ways. Firstly, we love music as I'm sure you do. But we really love music, writing it, playing it, recording it, mixing it...etc. We know how powerful and important it is to so many people. When i was a kid of 13 or 14 years old I dreamt about going into a recording studio and recording my dumb little songs (I was young, they weren't very good yet, don't know if the are any good now :) but growing up a poor kid that idea wasn't even remotely possible. </div>
<div>We want to be able to provide an amazing, fun, and memorable recording experience for any band or artist on a budget nearly anybody can afford. Plus you'll get an amazing sounding album at the end of your recording experience.</div>
<div><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">Risks &amp; Challenges </span></div>
</div><div>Running and keeping a studio together is a lot of hard work as you can imagine. There are quite a bit of operating costs like overhead, new equipment, equipment failure, consumables, etc. Scheduling can be a challenge. Getting the best performance from clients and having them relax and be comfortable when the red light comes on can sometimes be a lesson in patience. But let me stop complaining those are our problems and let us worry about that.<br/>

For this project, every track will have the usual bass (electric or upright) and drums.  Our lovely rhythm section will be Brad Fordham and Lisa Pankratz, Noel McKay will be lending guitar skills, and T Jerrod Bonta will be playing piano.  I also plan to include a lot of fiddle and steel (lap and pedal) and a few other nice surprises.These numbers are based on past projects I've done and are by no means exact:

Studio time and engineer fee: $1500
Musician pay: $4000
Radio Promoter fee: $2500
Postage for radio mail outs: $700

<p>This is an opportunity for you to help progress the advancement of technology dealing with audio/visual &amp; multimedia arts presentations.</p>
<p>I am Juan Atkins (aka) “The God Father of Techno music” this title was given to me by Face magazine &amp; Record Mirror from London in a feature story they acquired when coming to Detroit in 1989 to cover this new and exciting music that was catching on in London called techno. And, because I am the originator of the music genre called “Techno music” which is the precursor to what we now call Electronic Dance Music (EDM) today.</p>
<p>I started my professional music career with an electronic synth band called Cybotron, which is a group formed in 1980 by myself and Rik Davis (aka) 3070. Cybotron released America’s first all electronic dance music record called “Alleys of your mind” on our own label “Deep Space Records”. The record was a smash hit in Detroit which subsequently led to a national record deal with Fantasy records out of Berkeley California. Cybotron released an album with Fantasy and 2 singles from the album “Cosmic cars” and “Clear” which became international hits and put me on the path to become known worldwide as the “Originator” of techno music.</p>
<p>I left Cybotron in 1985, because of musical differences between me and Rik, and started to record and release music under the name “Model 500”, on my own label “Metroplex Records” that I both created. I have been recording and performing live as Model 500 ever since. Thus, I have honed and developed Model 500 into a global brand and international icon for electronic music with no help from anywhere. Needless to say, it has been hard work and a financial challenge to achieve all this with no support other than you electronic music lovers,fans &amp; patrons.</p>
<p>Technology has recently changed the landscape of virtually everything we see and hear now, so it’s time and imperative that Model 500 stay on the cutting edge and ahead of the curve in terms of how the new progression of audio/visual multimedia live shows are presented and perceived. Basically, moving Model 500 into the next level of live presentations.</p>
<p>So as you know, Model 500 will be playing live at Movement 2015 in a few weeks. Because of the City of Detroit’s relevance in the world of dance music, I want to make this year’s performance, and future performances, a show that you will never forget, and bringing Model 500 to the next level. With that said, I have some ideas marinating in the Metroplex laboratories to make these shows the most cutting-edge and memorable performances I’ve ever done in my 35 years in this business. To do it, however, it’s going to cost me a lot of money, around $50,000. But, an out of pocket expense for me to spend that much money, that we can’t really afford to float right now, doesn’t make much business sense, I am told by my advisors. So I’m reaching out to all of you to say, if you want to truly experience Model 500 as it should be experienced, and make a contribution towards the advancement of forward thinking technological music &amp; art, then let’s do it together Detroit and fans across the world. This will be the show you won’t ever forget. Juan</p>

</div></div>","￼Hello World, Friends, and Fans of Detroit Techno,
This is an opportunity for you to help progress the advancement of technology dealing with audio/visual & multimedia arts presentations.
I am Juan Atkins (aka) “The God Father of Techno music” this title was given to me by Face magazine & Record Mirror from London in a feature story they acquired when coming to Detroit in 1989 to cover this new and exciting music that was catching on in London called techno. And, because I am the originator of the music genre called “Techno music” which is the precursor to what we now call Electronic Dance Music (EDM) today.
I started my professional music career with an electronic synth band called Cybotron, which is a group formed in 1980 by myself and Rik Davis (aka) 3070. Cybotron released America’s first all electronic dance music record called “Alleys of your mind” on our own label “Deep Space Records”. The record was a smash hit in Detroit which subsequently led to a national record deal with Fantasy records out of Berkeley California. Cybotron released an album with Fantasy and 2 singles from the album “Cosmic cars” and “Clear” which became international hits and put me on the path to become known worldwide as the “Originator” of techno music.
I left Cybotron in 1985, because of musical differences between me and Rik, and started to record and release music under the name “Model 500”, on my own label “Metroplex Records” that I both created. I have been recording and performing live as Model 500 ever since. Thus, I have honed and developed Model 500 into a global brand and international icon for electronic music with no help from anywhere. Needless to say, it has been hard work and a financial challenge to achieve all this with no support other than you electronic music lovers,fans & patrons.
Technology has recently changed the landscape of virtually everything we see and hear now, so it’s time and imperative that Model 500 stay on the cutting edge and ahead of the curve in terms of how the new progression of audio/visual multimedia live shows are presented and perceived. Basically, moving Model 500 into the next level of live presentations.
So as you know, Model 500 will be playing live at Movement 2015 in a few weeks. Because of the City of Detroit’s relevance in the world of dance music, I want to make this year’s performance, and future performances, a show that you will never forget, and bringing Model 500 to the next level. With that said, I have some ideas marinating in the Metroplex laboratories to make these shows the most cutting-edge and memorable performances I’ve ever done in my 35 years in this business. To do it, however, it’s going to cost me a lot of money, around $50,000. But, an out of pocket expense for me to spend that much money, that we can’t really afford to float right now, doesn’t make much business sense, I am told by my advisors. So I’m reaching out to all of you to say, if you want to truly experience Model 500 as it should be experienced, and make a contribution towards the advancement of forward thinking technological music & art, then let’s do it together Detroit and fans across the world. This will be the show you won’t ever forget. Juan

</div><p>Hi! My name is Owen Robinette and I'm
currently a student at Lafayette College. I’ve had a serious passion for music for my
entire life– I learned to read and write listening to John Lennon and The
Beatles, and music has been an integral part of my life ever since. To me,
music is a way into another person’s mind and a way to express your thoughts
and opinions. That expression of feelings is what I love most about music,
because you can use it to cheer you up, to keep you going, etc. It helps to create
and build a connection that with someone you've never met before.</p>
<p>Because of my deep love for music, I began to develop an interest
in the industry. In the Hip-Hop genre, I began to notice the oversaturation of
new music and new artists, which meant few got recognition or compensation for
their work, let alone record deals. Basically, even if the product artists had
to offer was both genuine and high-quality, most artists were going unnoticed. It
made me want to create a space for artists to freely express their voice while
gaining both recognition and compensation for their art. And thus, Royal
Dynasty was born.</p>
<p>The goal of Royal Dynasty is to provide artists with the ability
to create the music they want, while being compensated in a way that promotes
their own creative independence. We will split the profits 50-50 with the
artist, something that no other company in the music industry does. Most
importantly, we hope to better connect artists with their fans. Music builds
connections- imagine how impactful it could be if we work to build and strengthen
those bonds. Royal Dynasty will provide a more immersive, open experience for
fans of growing artists and focus on the heart of music. By utilizing a
pay-what-you-want model for purchasing music, combined with a tiered system of
rewards, fans have the opportunity not only to support their favorite upcoming
artists, but to participate in personal, meaningful interactions with the
artists they enjoy. </p>
<h3>To do this, we need your help!</h3>
<p>In order to begin this project, we need startup money to buy the
website domain and software, as well as pay a designer to develop the site. We
are seeking to utilize WordPress’
business site plan, which costs $300 a year and provides many of the
features we would need to run an effective (and awesome) website. </p>
<p>Finally, we need money to build up inventory. This allows us to attract artists and send out awesome rewards (such as the
ones we’ve offered for this IndieGoGo campaign). A list of our current
ideas are listed below, and we are always looking for new ways to connect our
artists with fans in a meaningful, impactful way. </p>
<h3>Our Mission:</h3>
<p>Hip-Hop music which is popular today tends to stray from the
genre’s original intentions. While it is still alive in a few artists
(such as Kendrick Lamar, J-Cole, Run the Jewels, Big K.R.I.T.), it appears that
the days of political storytelling are fading away. As a result, artists tend
to lose some control over their music and their message, feeling the need to
conform to what’s
popular in order to make it big.</p>
<p>Because of this phenomenon, one of our core goals is to create an
organization which provides artists with agency within their craft. This
includes providing more compensation so that artists have more control over
their creative material. Artists we have selected have a unique sound and
message, and we wish to enhance an artist’s style rather than stifle it. Basically, we
want artists to be able to create quality music without interference from
corporations who only care about the bottom line. Instead, Royal Dynasty would
offer a supportive community composed of artists and music lovers that can
provide thoughtful feedback and guidance.Together, this combination of artistic independence and guidance will
result in an overall higher quality of music.</p>
<p>And, of course, Royal Dynasty wants to provide fans with an
immersive experience the likes of which has never been seen before. Fans will
have unique opportunities to interact with artists from discussions with the
featured artists of the week and a pay-what-you-want model for purchasing
music. All artists will have their music available for streaming on the site,
so those fans who prefer not to pay can still easily access all music. Once
again, all advertising revenue that comes from streaming will be split 50-50
between the artists and Royal Dynasty. However, for those fans who wish to
support their favorite artist by purchasing music, there will be multiple
reward tiers. Not only will this directly benefit artists, but the rewards will
allow fans to connect with their artists. As a music fan, this kind of program
is something I’ve always wanted- it makes music that much
more personal.</p>
<p>The tiers will vary based at the discretion of the artists.
Rewards will include, but not be limited to:</p>
<p>■  The
MP3 of the album (comes with any level of purchase)</p>
<p>■  Desktop
wallpapers/CD covers</p>
<p>■  Posters
(Some Autographed)</p>
<p>■  Awesome
buttons </p>
<p>■  A
T-shirt/Hoodie (Some autographed)</p>
<p>■  A
signed CD (Printed with booklet and case, in addition to the MP3s which come
with all purchases)</p>
<p>■  A
handwritten letter from the artist</p>
<p>■  A
Skype call with the artist </p>
<p>And this is just the beginning. We
look forward to the feedback of both artists and fans so that we can ensure we’re
offering the best experience for everyone. We’ll be communicating with you, which
includes a weekly newsletter to keep you updated on any new developments. In
addition, we will have an active customer service line dedicated to questions
and comments from the site’s users. We can’t wait to
offer you a unique music experience and want to hear your thoughts throughout
the process!</p>
<h3>More ways you can help!</h3>
<p>Even if you can’t
monetarily contribute to the project, there are still many other ways that you
can help us succeed! If you like the idea, spread the word! Post this on your
Facebook, Twitter, and use Indiegogo’s
share tools!</p>
<p>We would also love feedback and suggestions for future features. Like
we said, feedback from fans is key to providing an excellent product. We are
open to discussing any and all suggestions, and, if it’s a good one, you could even be featured
on the site.</p>
<p>Finally, if you or a friend is an upcoming artist in any genre
(while our focus is Hip-Hop, we hope to expand our reach to other genres as
well) contact us at royaldynastyincorporated@gmail.com and send in your work! While we can’t promise you a spot on the site when we
launch, we are always willing to offer our feedback and remain in contact as
you progress as an artist.</p><div>

Hip-Hop music which is popular today tends to stray from the
genre’s original intentions. While it is still alive in a few artists
(such as Kendrick Lamar, J-Cole, Run the Jewels, Big K.R.I.T.), it appears that
the days of political storytelling are fading away. As a result, artists tend
to lose some control over their music and their message, feeling the need to
conform to what’s
popular in order to make it big.
Because of this phenomenon, one of our core goals is to create an
organization which provides artists with agency within their craft. This
includes providing more compensation so that artists have more control over
their creative material. Artists we have selected have a unique sound and
message, and we wish to enhance an artist’s style rather than stifle it. Basically, we
want artists to be able to create quality music without interference from
corporations who only care about the bottom line. Instead, Royal Dynasty would
offer a supportive community composed of artists and music lovers that can
provide thoughtful feedback and guidance.Together, this combination of artistic independence and guidance will
result in an overall higher quality of music.
And, of course, Royal Dynasty wants to provide fans with an
immersive experience the likes of which has never been seen before. Fans will
have unique opportunities to interact with artists from discussions with the
featured artists of the week and a pay-what-you-want model for purchasing
music. All artists will have their music available for streaming on the site,
so those fans who prefer not to pay can still easily access all music. Once
again, all advertising revenue that comes from streaming will be split 50-50
between the artists and Royal Dynasty. However, for those fans who wish to
support their favorite artist by purchasing music, there will be multiple
reward tiers. Not only will this directly benefit artists, but the rewards will
allow fans to connect with their artists. As a music fan, this kind of program
is something I’ve always wanted- it makes music that much
more personal.
The tiers will vary based at the discretion of the artists.
Rewards will include, but not be limited to:
■  The
MP3 of the album (comes with any level of purchase)
■  Desktop
wallpapers/CD covers
■  Posters
(Some Autographed)
■  Awesome
buttons 
■  A
T-shirt/Hoodie (Some autographed)
■  A
signed CD (Printed with booklet and case, in addition to the MP3s which come
with all purchases)
■  A
handwritten letter from the artist
■  A
Skype call with the artist 
And this is just the beginning. We
look forward to the feedback of both artists and fans so that we can ensure we’re
offering the best experience for everyone. We’ll be communicating with you, which
includes a weekly newsletter to keep you updated on any new developments. In
addition, we will have an active customer service line dedicated to questions
and comments from the site’s users. We can’t wait to
offer you a unique music experience and want to hear your thoughts throughout
the process!
More ways you can help!
Even if you can’t
monetarily contribute to the project, there are still many other ways that you
can help us succeed! If you like the idea, spread the word! Post this on your
Facebook, Twitter, and use Indiegogo’s
share tools!
We would also love feedback and suggestions for future features. Like
we said, feedback from fans is key to providing an excellent product. We are
open to discussing any and all suggestions, and, if it’s a good one, you could even be featured
on the site.
Finally, if you or a friend is an upcoming artist in any genre
(while our focus is Hip-Hop, we hope to expand our reach to other genres as
well) contact us at royaldynastyincorporated@gmail.com and send in your work! While we can’t promise you a spot on the site when we
launch, we are always willing to offer our feedback and remain in contact as
you progress as an artist.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>I want to tell you about a
project that has been spinning in my head for over twenty-five years and now
through Indiegogo and your excitement, I see the opportunity to bring it to
life!</p>
<p>It’s a fantastic project
taught by nature, based on its architecture and its incredible organic
structures. The desert cactus is a clear example: gorgeous and resistant to the
extreme desert conditions where many organisms cannot live; it invites us to
copy its daring geometric shapes and apply them for the human use.</p>

<p>Watch its
bold and vast geometry, so perfectly achieved to be worthy of life. Now is the
time to study and apply its designs to develop ecological structures that can
adapt to nature.</p>
<p>Though the
years I have analyzed these shapes and developed a few architectural projects with
different sizes and functions. The one that I am going to introduce you its the
one with a basic shape for a Music Hall that will be built in the immediacy of
Merida, Yucatan, Mexico, city of Mayan ancestors. The function of this compound
will be to host a forum for great music and art, under an impressive roof, architectonically
inspired in a “<i>Ferocactus</i>”… A delight to every sense…!</p>
<p>This
project is about a structure in patent process, built with steel tubes
connected to each other making different layers at the same time, all of them
simulate the cactus shape and resistance as it elevates until 10m height, 32m interiors
length and 14m of exterior height.</p>

appearance. On top of every cone a knot will be placed with incredible flat thorns,
inclined and in leaf shape. Like the ones that the real Ferocactus of the

<p>The Cactus
Music Hall will be an eco-friendly compound, friend of nature because it won’t
damage its surroundings like a normal construction would; there is more, its
structure will invite others to protect and respect the place. As part of its
technology, it will produce its own energy through the wind and sunlight. Our
objective is to imitate, as close as possible the beauty and intelligence that
nature has placed in the cactus to be an auto-sufficient, resistant and
beautiful masterpiece.</p>
<p>As you can
see in Indiegogo, there is an awaking new culture, just like it happened in the
Renaissance. Enthusiastic and innovative people face these times and they need
a little support to make their dreams come true.</p>

<p>Also included pay the
workers, their health insurance, the construction licence and other expenses

<p>In the budget
there is not included, the cover of a special material called ETFE (or similar), lighting facilities, sound and special facilities,
sunlight and wind powered systems, outdoor furniture, and the conditioning of
other areas as parking, access between others. In order to build these elements
there will be a new Indiegogo campaign, the second stage.</p>
<p>If the
sponsorship goal to bring this cactus alive is exceeded, the facilities described

<p>This beautiful
and innovative structure will be built on a property owned by me, located on
the surroundings of the city of Mérida Yucatán, México, because it concentrates
the ideal features for operation and acces. You can see the place on the

<p><b>STORY</b></p>
<h3><b>THE HISTORY OF MANNEQUIN PLANET</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Mannequin Planet released its first album Humannequin in 2011. After the album and a series of shows, founding singers Jesus:v. buddha 3.9 and Satori departed in pursuit of other ambitions while founding musician and producer W)Rong Sounds carried on with the Handy Mann, the creator of Mannequin Planet. They released one EP, <i>Insane Experiments</i>, with W)Rong Sounds taking over vocal duties. <br/><br/>NOW, Mannequin Planet is back. Joining the Handy Mann, Jesus: version buddha 3.9 returns to the mic, along with new co-vocalist Mourning Glory, and on guitars, Poison enVy. New actors and performance artists Kabal Inferno, Danica Knight, and Anipso round out the group!</p>
<p>The Handy Mann has been collecting, assembling, and deconstructing mannequins for almost a decade, and now, his collection, which comprises the population of Mannequin Planet, numbers in the hundreds. We take these crazy machinations on stage with us everywhere we go! <br/><br/>Featuring an incredible new light show, also joining us onstage are juggling (and drinking) clowns, erotic body painters, unicyclists, demolition crews, dancers, crazy props and costumes, and creative types of all kinds. Also joining us could be YOU! </p>
<p>Mannequin Planet is a band for the people. We are always looking to collaborate with new creatives, and anyone is welcome to bring their talents to our stage.</p>

Our philosophy in one alliterative phrase: 
MANNEQUINS, MUSIC, MODELS, MOVIES!!!


 Check out our progress as we rehearse the vocals (and live guitars) for one of the new songs in the video below! 



Recording the vocals isn't just a process of singing into a mic though... We need to pay an expert producer who can help us produce, mix, engineer, and master the finished product! Normally, this would cost a minimum of several thousands of dollars to have it done at the level of professional quality that we are determined to meet (and met for our first album). In our case though, we have done this before and know what we are doing, and we have someone who believes in the project who is enthusiastic about working with us on a limited budget for his love of the music! 
  THE CAMPAIGN: 
Share in the Creation and the Rewards of Our Project! 

The music of Mannequin Planet is just as sensational and epic as its crazy and fantastic shows (more on that below!). We have not one, but TWO complete new albums, completely mastered, engineered, and produced - but no vocals! This fundraiser is to raise the necessary funds to finish these two new maniacal mannequin masterpieces.
Look us up on Spotify, and you'll find Mannequin Planet's first album, Humannequin. You can also check out various songs from the many incarnations of Mannequin Planet on www.reverbnation.com/mannequinplanetThis should give you a taste - We believe though that the new stuff is even better! 




For $35, you can have all three albums, plus a chance to appear on stage with Mannequin Planet. 
IF JUST 28 PEOPLE DONATE AT THE $35 PERK LEVEL, WE WILL HAVE MET OUR GOAL AND WILL COMPLETE BOTH  NEW ALBUMS!!!
STRETCH GOALS: 
We would also like to buy t-shirts and pressed CDs with artwork for the albums. Please check out the perks you can get if we exceed our goal! 
If Mannequin Planet raises $1300, everyone who donated at the $35 level receives a Mannequin Planet t-shirt! 



If Mannequin Planet raises $1700, everyone who donated at the $35 level receives a t-shirt, and a pressed physical copy of Soul Plasticity, with awesome artwork! 
And if Mannequin Planet raises $2000, everyone who donated at the $35 level will receive a t-shirt, plus a pressed physical copy of both The Planet Clitoris and Soul Plasticity, with awesome artwork! 
PERKS ABOVE $35
The perks only get better as the donations get higher... For $40, we'll include lyrics books with detailed accounts of the songs' inspirations, plus annotations detailing the movies that the samples in the songs are from!
For  $50, we will send a digital download of a collection of Mannequin Planet rarities - this exclusive album contains unheard covers, remixes, alternate versions, outtakes, and new songs! 
AT THE $60 LEVEL, WE INVITE YOU TO COME TO A CD LISTENING PARTY AND DINNER AT THE MANNEQUIN MANSION, home to the Handy Mann and his hundreds of mannequins and props. 


At $75, add two bootleg live performances of Mannequin Planet's 2011 shows!
For $100, receive all the above, plus an autographed mannequin head! 

The $200 level is a Jesus personal favorite: a signed vintage 2011 poster of Mannequin Planet's last show with the original lineup of the band. The show was performed at the Red Devil Lounge, which has since closed due to the gentrification and raised tax rates in the Nob Hill neighborhood. Designed by W)Rong Sounds, the poster is a high-def glossy portrait of a red mannequin's face in a blue moon... A beautiful sci-fi psychodramatic landscape. 



The $300 level gets you an executive producer credit on each album.
For $400, receive one of the Handy Mann's locally famous art bikes! 




At the $500 level come in and record an alternate version of one the songs! We will even include it on the rarities compilation - plus, receive our everlasting gratitude... $500 would finance the completion of one whole album! 
At each perk level, you receive all previous perks of lesser value.

<h3><b>The Mission</b></h3>
<p><span>Music is a universal language.  Music unifies, provides comfort, makes us
feel good, highlights moments, makes us all feel alive and it can take us into the
depths of our imagination or pull us strongly into the present moment. It's this power and potential of music that drives me to write songs and share them with the world.<br/></span></p>
<p><span>I’ve spent
years growing as a songwriter, recording artist and live entertainer.  It is one of the best feelings in the world
to impact other people with melodies, stories and connection; to use music to
help people feel happy and free – and it’s time to do this on a much bigger
scale.  Over the past 5 years I’ve
written more than an album full of songs. 
Myself, people on my team, trusted ears in the industry and fans at
shows over the past 2+ years feel that these songs and this album will fulfill on that
purpose.  We just need to come together
to enable top-notch production of the music and to get these
melodies/messages/songs out in as big a way as possible.</span></p>
<p>Check
out everything on the page to learn more about how we can help people feel
happy and free with The Wow Project.<span> 
Contribute and let’s bring this mission to the world :)</span></p>

<h3>The $'s</h3>
<p>Professionally
<u>recording</u> an album is expensive.  Professionally <u>releasing</u> an
album is VERY expensive.<span>  I’ve invested
$5000 of my own savings so far and will invest at least double that over the
course of the project.  This has allowed
for the recording of the first single, Wow, and the putting together of the
production team, creating the project plan, and the initial development of an
industry-standard promotional plan.  I
will cover all travel costs associated with creating this album. 
Now we need to raise the <i>rest of
the funds</i> to create an amazing album and give it wings around the world.</span></p>
<p>We
are starting by raising $33,300, which is the minimum needed to achieve
world-class sound quality.<span>  To begin meaningfully promoting the project
nationally would entail a total budget of $50,000+.  And to really achieve the dream and promote
the album INTERNATIONALLY we would need upwards of $70,000.</span></p>
<p>When
we surpass the first goal, I’ll share with you more about
how the extra funds above that will be distributed in spreading the word
Nationally, and then Internationally :)</p>
<h3><b>The Team</b></h3>

<p>TV/Film/Commercial
Song Placement (Syncing): <i>Bellringer

<p>PR
&amp; Radio: As the recordings progress and we are ready to begin this phase of
the project (3-4 months from funding), we will announce the full team we’ve
partnered with to enhance and carry out our plan to spread the music around the
world.</p>
<h3><b>The Plan - Creation</b></h3>
<p>My
team and I have put together a detailed concrete plan and budget for creating
full-length album that is high quality and a true expression of the word
‘Wow’.<span>  Here are the components of the
recording / creation process in order of size.</span></p>
<p>Production
&amp; Mixing – This is where it all starts, with a great song being turned into
a great recording.<span>  Two-thirds of what is
raised in our initial $33,300 goal goes directly to making that happen.  There’s studio time and compensating our
amazing, experienced producers / mixers.</span></p>
<p>Music
Video – As our budget grows, more will be allocated to the music video.<span>  Furthermore, we will be applying for every
grant possible in Ontario and Canada to create a budget above and beyond what
we raise here so that we can add more impact to those melodies and lyrics in a
world class music video.</span></p>
<p>Behind-the-Scenes
&amp; Exclusive Videos – We will document this process, the highs, lows, the
interesting, special and funny moments.<span> 
Some of the videos will be released first or even exclusively to those
who contribute to the The Wow Package<b>. </b>But everyone will definitely be updated and
sharing in this process every step of the way.</span></p>
<p>Mastering
– This is what takes great recordings and makes them sound loud, pleasant and
oh so sweet on any type of speaker (iPod, car, radio, ghetto blaster, phone,
laptop, etc).</p>
<p>Duplication
– Gotta press those album copies.<span>  An
initial 1000-CD  run will allow us to fulfill your Indiegogo Perks in exchange
for your Contributions.</span></p>
<p>Artwork
&amp; Design – Making the CD, insert booklet, digital image and other materials
look pretty.</p>

Musicians – We may need violin, string players or other talented musicians to
help bring these songs to life in the studio.</p>

<h3><b>The Plan - Release</b></h3>
<p>As
we surpass $33,300 and I add more of my own savings, we’ll be able to implement
the Wow Release Plan.<span>  Depending on what
is raised will determine how big we can go, and for how long.  Regardless of what that is, the Wow Project
will be the biggest event I have been apart of as a recording artist – and it’s
exciting to be creating it together.</span></p>
<p>Publicity
– A great music PR firm is essential for a release.<span>  They get high priority editorial features in
magazines, blogs and newspapers.  They
get you on television shows, web concert series, radio performances.  Essentially they build awareness of an artist
&amp; their music by taking them EVERYWHERE around the media landscape.</span></p>
<p>Radio
– Yes, it ain’t what it used to be when radio, TV and the newspapers were the
unchallenged mass marketing pillars for label releases.<span>  BUT it’s still one of the popular ways for
people to find music.  We’re fortunate to
be connected with major radio promoters in the US and Canada who are able to
push the music to their contacts and get it on college and mainstream
radio.  This is easily the most expensive
thing to do in a campaign, and we will scale up as we raise funds.</span></p>
<p>Videos
– The first music video, behind-the-scenes and exclusive video content is
included in the Creation Plan, and there are subsequent videos we envision
creating.<span>  We’ve created a catalogue of
ideas for cover videos, funny clips, live videos and more sweet music videos of
songs from the album.</span></p>
<p>Advertising
– There’s a way to use online advertising most effectively, and we’ve gotten
incredible insight and planning advice from some of the world’s best internet
marketers … which is just someone that knows how to reach the right person,
with the right message (or song ;) at the right time.<span>  We have some best in class ideas to implement
here on Facebook and online/offline magazines.</span></p>
<p>Mailings
– Licensing songs from the album helps build awareness and our ability to
re-invest in amplifying our efforts.<span> 
Getting songs in film/television/commercials will be a focus of the
release and we will be mailing out the music and press kits to influencers and
decision-makers in those fields.</span></p>
<p>Tour
– This will be the final stage of the entire process … there will be shows
throughout, but an organized, expertly crafted and smoothly run tour is vital
to actually creating those moments that make people say ‘Wow’, in person.<span>  Booking the dates and generating local press
for each show and appearance will be vital to this fully involved campaign.</span></p>

</p>
<h4>What
if…</h4>
<p>So
what happens if we don’t raise well above $33,300 to implement the widespread
release plan?<span>  Regardless, everyone that
contributes will be getting an amazing album and the totally awesome experiences
associated with the perk you generously contributed to.  Mark my words, this is happening, 100% ... the idea is to raise as much as possible with this Indiegogo campaign, then build further support, expand our resources and implement from there.<br/></span></p>
<h4>What’s
Already Happened…</h4>
<p>In
2009 I released my first full length record, Thoughts Out Loud – it was
recorded with $30,000 won in an online songwriting contest for singer
songwriters at SliceThePie.com (the site is very different now than it was in
2008).<span>  People loved the sound and the
songs, and it turned out great – I was (and still am) so proud of it.  BUT I had no idea what to do to get the music
out on a wider scale.  Last year into
this one I completed an intense 8-month program called Starbootcamp, which has
filled in all the blanks.  With clarity
in the formerly ‘muddy’ aspects of successfully releasing new music, I am so
excited as I work with great people to implement what I now know.</span></p>
<h4>The
Music Biz…</h4>
<p>We
have a concrete plan and I’m very confident that it will create more waves than
anything I’ve ever done and it will result in a successful album release.<span>  Now, we all know that this is show biz …
nothing is fully guaranteed.  Should we
not get the initial results we’re looking for in our release plans, we will be agile
and make adjustments along the way (yep, the big record labels do that too).  There will be course corrections no doubt.  The important thing is,
we’re working with experienced professionals that are enthusiastically
committed to the Wow Project, every step of the way.  Our intention and resolve is to use our
creativity, our positive attitudes and the wisdom of our experiences to
overcome any challenge and treat every step as an opportunity.</span></p>

<p></p></div>","The Mission
Music is a universal language.  Music unifies, provides comfort, makes us
feel good, highlights moments, makes us all feel alive and it can take us into the
depths of our imagination or pull us strongly into the present moment. It's this power and potential of music that drives me to write songs and share them with the world.
I’ve spent
years growing as a songwriter, recording artist and live entertainer.  It is one of the best feelings in the world
to impact other people with melodies, stories and connection; to use music to
help people feel happy and free – and it’s time to do this on a much bigger
scale.  Over the past 5 years I’ve
written more than an album full of songs. 
Myself, people on my team, trusted ears in the industry and fans at
shows over the past 2+ years feel that these songs and this album will fulfill on that
purpose.  We just need to come together
to enable top-notch production of the music and to get these
melodies/messages/songs out in as big a way as possible.
Check
out everything on the page to learn more about how we can help people feel
happy and free with The Wow Project. 
Contribute and let’s bring this mission to the world :)

Acoustic House Concert:  
Something you can do with your friends and family, that would be different than a party and most things experienced the rest of the year.  An intimate setting with 20+ people in a living room, common room, backyard, etc. I'll play music off the new album and other releases, tell stories, and create moments of laughter, excitement and being moved. I promise a Wow Experience for your friends and family.
Company / Client Appreciation Concert:
If your organization's value line up with being happy and free, then it's time to create that experience for your teams or for your clients.  This is NOT background cover music at a Christmas party, where's the Wow in that?  I have experience in boardrooms helping groups in a company come together with music.  We will create an event that truly unites a team.  And we can also share this same vibe with the customers that make your work possible.
Your Very Own Wedding Song:
Want to do something crazy unique for your / your friend's wedding?  How about I write you a song, professionally record it and come to your wedding to play it live!  Here's a custom wedding song, unveiled for the first time on their big day...


Videos
Single from 'Thoughts Out Loud', Get It Right - filmed in Playa Del Carmen, Mexico:
We Are Ready - this whole recording, done in Nashville, and the video filmed over 2 days were created by several passionate people on a slim budget.  Imagine what we'll be able to do with The Wow Project videos and release...

The $'s
Professionally
recording an album is expensive.  Professionally releasing an
album is VERY expensive.  I’ve invested
$5000 of my own savings so far and will invest at least double that over the
course of the project.  This has allowed
for the recording of the first single, Wow, and the putting together of the
production team, creating the project plan, and the initial development of an
industry-standard promotional plan.  I
will cover all travel costs associated with creating this album. 
Now we need to raise the rest of
the funds to create an amazing album and give it wings around the world.
We
are starting by raising $33,300, which is the minimum needed to achieve
world-class sound quality.  To begin meaningfully promoting the project
nationally would entail a total budget of $50,000+.  And to really achieve the dream and promote
the album INTERNATIONALLY we would need upwards of $70,000.
When
we surpass the first goal, I’ll share with you more about
how the extra funds above that will be distributed in spreading the word
Nationally, and then Internationally :)

PR
& Radio: As the recordings progress and we are ready to begin this phase of
the project (3-4 months from funding), we will announce the full team we’ve
partnered with to enhance and carry out our plan to spread the music around the
world.
The Plan - Creation
My
team and I have put together a detailed concrete plan and budget for creating
full-length album that is high quality and a true expression of the word
‘Wow’.  Here are the components of the
recording / creation process in order of size.
Production
& Mixing – This is where it all starts, with a great song being turned into
a great recording.  Two-thirds of what is
raised in our initial $33,300 goal goes directly to making that happen.  There’s studio time and compensating our
amazing, experienced producers / mixers.
Music
Video – As our budget grows, more will be allocated to the music video.  Furthermore, we will be applying for every
grant possible in Ontario and Canada to create a budget above and beyond what
we raise here so that we can add more impact to those melodies and lyrics in a
world class music video.
Behind-the-Scenes
& Exclusive Videos – We will document this process, the highs, lows, the
interesting, special and funny moments. 
Some of the videos will be released first or even exclusively to those
who contribute to the The Wow Package. But everyone will definitely be updated and
sharing in this process every step of the way.
Mastering
– This is what takes great recordings and makes them sound loud, pleasant and
oh so sweet on any type of speaker (iPod, car, radio, ghetto blaster, phone,
laptop, etc).
Duplication
– Gotta press those album copies.  An
initial 1000-CD  run will allow us to fulfill your Indiegogo Perks in exchange
for your Contributions.
Artwork
& Design – Making the CD, insert booklet, digital image and other materials
look pretty.
Guest
Musicians – We may need violin, string players or other talented musicians to
help bring these songs to life in the studio.
Equipment
Rental – We demand perfection of our sound vision!  There will likely be an exotic amp, synth
keyboard or other piece of audio gear for us to rent that will be the icing on
the cake for a song or two.




The Plan - Release
As
we surpass $33,300 and I add more of my own savings, we’ll be able to implement
the Wow Release Plan.  Depending on what
is raised will determine how big we can go, and for how long.  Regardless of what that is, the Wow Project
will be the biggest event I have been apart of as a recording artist – and it’s
exciting to be creating it together.
Publicity
– A great music PR firm is essential for a release.  They get high priority editorial features in
magazines, blogs and newspapers.  They
get you on television shows, web concert series, radio performances.  Essentially they build awareness of an artist
& their music by taking them EVERYWHERE around the media landscape.
Radio
– Yes, it ain’t what it used to be when radio, TV and the newspapers were the
unchallenged mass marketing pillars for label releases.  BUT it’s still one of the popular ways for
people to find music.  We’re fortunate to
be connected with major radio promoters in the US and Canada who are able to
push the music to their contacts and get it on college and mainstream
radio.  This is easily the most expensive
thing to do in a campaign, and we will scale up as we raise funds.
Videos
– The first music video, behind-the-scenes and exclusive video content is
included in the Creation Plan, and there are subsequent videos we envision
creating.  We’ve created a catalogue of
ideas for cover videos, funny clips, live videos and more sweet music videos of
songs from the album.
Advertising
– There’s a way to use online advertising most effectively, and we’ve gotten
incredible insight and planning advice from some of the world’s best internet
marketers … which is just someone that knows how to reach the right person,
with the right message (or song ;) at the right time.  We have some best in class ideas to implement
here on Facebook and online/offline magazines.
Mailings
– Licensing songs from the album helps build awareness and our ability to
re-invest in amplifying our efforts. 
Getting songs in film/television/commercials will be a focus of the
release and we will be mailing out the music and press kits to influencers and
decision-makers in those fields.
Tour
– This will be the final stage of the entire process … there will be shows
throughout, but an organized, expertly crafted and smoothly run tour is vital
to actually creating those moments that make people say ‘Wow’, in person.  Booking the dates and generating local press
for each show and appearance will be vital to this fully involved campaign.



Experience
I
feel so confident about making this a success.  I've had lots of experience executing a big projects.

I co-led 2 fundraiser dinners and
     missions trips to Uganda, where we donated the funds and our time to the
     Missionaries of the Poor in Kampala, Uganda.
I, along with some close team members
     and an army of supporters, won the $30,000 singer/songwriter contest at
     Slice The Pie.  We coordinated an
     ambitious campaign on Facebook and added to that with print coverage and

I recorded the single 'We Are Ready' in Nashville and pulled a team together of 50+ to help create the music video, standalone website and We Are Ready Challenge campaign.

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Not ready to fund us just yet? Here's our story...</span></p></span></h3>
<h3>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Verity </span><br/>
</h3> <p>My name is Rachelle Call and I got my start in the Christian Music Industry at the age of 29 when I was a wife and young mother to two daughters.  I have been performing and writing music for over a decade.  </p>
<p>I met Jessie Funk eight years ago at a recording session in Utah:  Jessie was laying vocal tracks to a song of mine that she would be including on her next studio project.  When I met Jessie Funk, I had recently moved to Utah from Colorado.  I was very interested in engaging Utah's music industry and knew that Jessie was the best of the best.  I loved her amazing voice and hearing her sing my music was a personal champion moment for me.  Her rich and strong vocals somehow strengthened me and added value to my life as I was searching for my own recovery from co-dependency and domestic abuse.  </p>
<p>As I made Utah my new home, Jessie became a bigger part of my life.  I turned to her more often to sing for my latest music projects and at live concert events.  It was at these events that Jessie and I quickly noticed the powerful impact our collaboration had on the audience.  There was an instant connection that almost seemed magical to us as musicians, and we wondered if the listeners were experiencing the same healing from our music that we knew was there.  </p>
<p>With this question in mind, Jessie and I began to take our partnership more seriously by laying out plans to start a female pop-rock duo.  We took the idea of what ""The Judds"" had done over the span of their career and adapted that to our own unique gifting and talents:  I would write/co-write the music and Jessie would be the voice.  </p>
<p>Together, our intention now is to weave a story of friendship and support that has been the foundation of our relationship and music. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Jessie and I are women who are passionate about living truthful lives and we hope that comes across in our music.  As we discussed our vision for becoming a duo, we wanted ""truth"" to be a major part of our branding. Jessie and I understand that life is very dynamic and what may be true for each of us differs based on circumstances, understanding and life purpose.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">With that in mind, Jessie named our group Verity.  Defined, verity means ""the quality or condition of being true, factual, or real.""  With so much pain and chaos going on in the world, the qualities of being true, real and genuine are important to cultivate.  Jessie and I want to present music that has come from a space of substance and value so that it lifts the listener to another realm of awareness and hope.  Jessie and I perform Verity's music from the perspective of women who are wives, mothers, friends and advocates for other women in the world who experience poverty, despair, sexual abuse, domestic abuse, inequality, mental illness and addictions.  It is our goal to create music that ignites a force for change, creativity, courage, and hope to those who seek their own unique purpose in life.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">What We Need </span></p>
</div><div> <ul>
<li>We have our music and now we need your help to begin production on our first project! Jessie and I have created so much music together over the years but now it is time to bring it all together under one purpose. Jessie and I are passionate about pop/rock music and we have a producer who understands this genre and can match our vision with his talent. The estimated cost for an EP (""extended Play"", i.e., longer than a single but not an entire album) of those tracks including mastering will be approximately $2,500 per completed song.   We have hired a PR management company to help us get our brand going, which includes photo's, website, iTunes distribution and indigo go campaign. This initial investment is $4,000. All-in, we would like to reach a goal of $16,500 to get us started. </li> <li>What you get with your contribution to VERITY:  Here's the cool thing about Verity as a duo act---we don't just perform music!  Jessie is the founder of Ivy Girls Academy which is a non-profit company that teaches young teenage girls the importance of confidence, composure and high standards for getting a start in life.  Rachelle is a social worker with years of experience mentoring women trapped in abusive relationships and addictive cycles.  Rachelle founded the Recovery concert tour and co-produced Recovery. The Music.--a concert experience designed to address the problems of addiction and mental illness in our communities. We are eager to reach out and connect with our fans and we are excited about the information we can share about recovery through our music.</li> <li>If we don't completely reach our goal, we will still produce the music.  Jessie and I are so proud of the music we create together that even if we only get enough for producing one song, we're happy to get started!</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Jessie and I feel a strong connection to women who are looking for a support system as they move through lives that are constantly changing.  Verity's music comes from very raw and personal experiences that so many women can relate to.  Our music assists the listener to address feelings and emotions that may be buried or just at the surface.  Music is a creative force for change and when used properly, it can be a remedy for increasing strength, insight and awareness. Jessie and I have felt this impact in our own lives as we create music together and we believe our listeners will have similar experiences.  </p>
<p>Jessie and I are both creative entrepreneurs who are passionate about improving the human condition throughout our world.  We have both launched successful businesses/projects that focus on various issues our families and individuals are faced with.  Jessie and I are both  respected professionals and leaders in our community and have served in many capacities.  We have a natural love and appreciation for others and our desire is to inspire hope and healing in everything we create.  </p>
<ul> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Jessie and I are realists.  We have been funding our own passion projects for years so we understand the pressure of finding the money for another project.  With that said, Verity is the culmination of all those years we have worked to fine tune the product that represents our vision.  </p>
<p>Being in the music industry for decades, Jessie and I know how many acts can come and go.  We understand how saturated the music scene can get with new artists coming and going.  Jessie and I are different in the timing of our project.  We have been carefully crafting and shaping our goals for over two years.  We have been patient with the process of understanding our fans and their needs.  We have written and sung our music from that space and we think this sets us apart from the constant hype of the music industry.  Jessie and I understand the need to connect with our fans on a one on one level. We plan to tour extensively to build trust and create connections with our fan base.  We plan to weave our music into a community support system that will be strong and stable.  From that stability, Jessie and I will stretch into new territory throughout the United States and in other countries as the message of our music begins to resonate with a broader population.  </p>
<p>Our vision is wide but we are willing to start small and build.  </p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Some of you may want to help, but don't have funds to contribute. That is ok! We would love your help in getting the word out. Share this project across your social channels (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc). We appreciate your help!!!</p>

I met Jessie Funk eight years ago at a recording session in Utah:  Jessie was laying vocal tracks to a song of mine that she would be including on her next studio project.  When I met Jessie Funk, I had recently moved to Utah from Colorado.  I was very interested in engaging Utah's music industry and knew that Jessie was the best of the best.  I loved her amazing voice and hearing her sing my music was a personal champion moment for me.  Her rich and strong vocals somehow strengthened me and added value to my life as I was searching for my own recovery from co-dependency and domestic abuse.  
As I made Utah my new home, Jessie became a bigger part of my life.  I turned to her more often to sing for my latest music projects and at live concert events.  It was at these events that Jessie and I quickly noticed the powerful impact our collaboration had on the audience.  There was an instant connection that almost seemed magical to us as musicians, and we wondered if the listeners were experiencing the same healing from our music that we knew was there.  
With this question in mind, Jessie and I began to take our partnership more seriously by laying out plans to start a female pop-rock duo.  We took the idea of what ""The Judds"" had done over the span of their career and adapted that to our own unique gifting and talents:  I would write/co-write the music and Jessie would be the voice.  
Together, our intention now is to weave a story of friendship and support that has been the foundation of our relationship and music. Jessie and I are women who are passionate about living truthful lives and we hope that comes across in our music.  As we discussed our vision for becoming a duo, we wanted ""truth"" to be a major part of our branding. Jessie and I understand that life is very dynamic and what may be true for each of us differs based on circumstances, understanding and life purpose.  
With that in mind, Jessie named our group Verity.  Defined, verity means ""the quality or condition of being true, factual, or real.""  With so much pain and chaos going on in the world, the qualities of being true, real and genuine are important to cultivate.  Jessie and I want to present music that has come from a space of substance and value so that it lifts the listener to another realm of awareness and hope.  Jessie and I perform Verity's music from the perspective of women who are wives, mothers, friends and advocates for other women in the world who experience poverty, despair, sexual abuse, domestic abuse, inequality, mental illness and addictions.  It is our goal to create music that ignites a force for change, creativity, courage, and hope to those who seek their own unique purpose in life.
What We Need 
 
We have our music and now we need your help to begin production on our first project! Jessie and I have created so much music together over the years but now it is time to bring it all together under one purpose. Jessie and I are passionate about pop/rock music and we have a producer who understands this genre and can match our vision with his talent. The estimated cost for an EP (""extended Play"", i.e., longer than a single but not an entire album) of those tracks including mastering will be approximately $2,500 per completed song.   We have hired a PR management company to help us get our brand going, which includes photo's, website, iTunes distribution and indigo go campaign. This initial investment is $4,000. All-in, we would like to reach a goal of $16,500 to get us started.  What you get with your contribution to VERITY:  Here's the cool thing about Verity as a duo act---we don't just perform music!  Jessie is the founder of Ivy Girls Academy which is a non-profit company that teaches young teenage girls the importance of confidence, composure and high standards for getting a start in life.  Rachelle is a social worker with years of experience mentoring women trapped in abusive relationships and addictive cycles.  Rachelle founded the Recovery concert tour and co-produced Recovery. The Music.--a concert experience designed to address the problems of addiction and mental illness in our communities. We are eager to reach out and connect with our fans and we are excited about the information we can share about recovery through our music. If we don't completely reach our goal, we will still produce the music.  Jessie and I are so proud of the music we create together that even if we only get enough for producing one song, we're happy to get started! 
  The Impact Jessie and I feel a strong connection to women who are looking for a support system as they move through lives that are constantly changing.  Verity's music comes from very raw and personal experiences that so many women can relate to.  Our music assists the listener to address feelings and emotions that may be buried or just at the surface.  Music is a creative force for change and when used properly, it can be a remedy for increasing strength, insight and awareness. Jessie and I have felt this impact in our own lives as we create music together and we believe our listeners will have similar experiences.  
Jessie and I are both creative entrepreneurs who are passionate about improving the human condition throughout our world.  We have both launched successful businesses/projects that focus on various issues our families and individuals are faced with.  Jessie and I are both  respected professionals and leaders in our community and have served in many capacities.  We have a natural love and appreciation for others and our desire is to inspire hope and healing in everything we create.  
 
  Risks & Challenges Jessie and I are realists.  We have been funding our own passion projects for years so we understand the pressure of finding the money for another project.  With that said, Verity is the culmination of all those years we have worked to fine tune the product that represents our vision.  
Being in the music industry for decades, Jessie and I know how many acts can come and go.  We understand how saturated the music scene can get with new artists coming and going.  Jessie and I are different in the timing of our project.  We have been carefully crafting and shaping our goals for over two years.  We have been patient with the process of understanding our fans and their needs.  We have written and sung our music from that space and we think this sets us apart from the constant hype of the music industry.  Jessie and I understand the need to connect with our fans on a one on one level. We plan to tour extensively to build trust and create connections with our fan base.  We plan to weave our music into a community support system that will be strong and stable.  From that stability, Jessie and I will stretch into new territory throughout the United States and in other countries as the message of our music begins to resonate with a broader population.  
Our vision is wide but we are willing to start small and build.
