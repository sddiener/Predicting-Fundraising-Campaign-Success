<p>Attorneys have free speech rights like every other citizen, including the right to criticize judges.  That is an important principle that I wish to have re-established by my planned appeal to the United States Supreme Court.   I am seeking donations for that appeal.  </p>
<p>This case that has already gotten substantial publicity.  (See links at the bottom of the page for stories on my case.)   In March of 2013, I was charged by the Indiana Supreme Court Disciplinary Commission with the violation of Rule 8.2 of the Rules of Professional Conduct.  That is the rule that purports to limit an attorney's criticism of judges and candidates for judges.</p>
<p>My offense?  I had written an email criticizing a judge for mishandling an estate case in which I represented one of three heirs who only received $8,000 in cash (and an interest in an LLC) out of over a million dollars in cash that passed through the estate in the six years it was open.  The email was in response to one that was sent to me and only went to the estate's attorney and others involved in the case.  The judge, who I had removed through the ""lazy judge"" procedure, was no longer on the case which was in its final stages of wrapping up.</p>
<p>The mother of the executor who I suspected of misappropriating money took the emails into the judge who demanded I apologize.   Even if I felt I owed him an apology for claiming he mishandled the estate, to do so could have been malpractice as it might have been used against my client should he take an appeal. When the apology didn't come, the judge sent the emails to the Disciplinary Commission which eventually filed charges.</p>
<p>Counsel for the Disciplinary Commission says it doesn't matter if a statement is public or private or even if a statement is simply an opinion.  The Commission takes the position that an attorney who criticizes a judge is subject to discipline under Rule 8.2 and that, if charged, the attorney bears the burden of proving the statement is true or the attorney is subject to sanctions.  If an attorney is out to lunch with a friend and says ""I think Judge Smith is biased against my client,"" according to the Commission that attorney is subject to a Rule 8.2 charge and will be sanctioned unless he can prove the judge is actually biased. </p>
<p>Rule 8.2 expressly adopts the <em>New York Times v. Sullivan</em> subjective standard for libelous free speech.  Yet that standard is routinely ignored by state supreme courts most of which employ an objective standard and switch the burden of proof to the attorney charged with misconduct.  (Indiana has never ruled definitively on the issue.)  While the United States Supreme Court has yet to decide a Rule 8.2 case, the Court has heard attorney free speech cases before and has consistently rebuffed attempts to limit attorney free speech. </p>
<p>In its most recent attorney free speech case, <em>Gentile v. Nevada</em>, the Court said attorneys enjoy free speech like everyone else and that disciplinary rules cannot be used to limit attorney free speech execept under the narrow circumstance when an attorney is speaking out publcly about a pending case in a manner that could influence a finder-of-fact, such as a jury.   </p>
<p>Unfortunately <em>Gentile</em> and other U.S. Supreme Court precedent have increasingly been ignored as state disciplinary bodies seek to sanction attorneys for violating ""civility codes.""  Want to criticize a judge in an email, on Twitter, on Facebook, on an attorney bulletin board?  Think again.  You might be a target for discipline.</p>
<p><em>Gentile</em> is now 22 years old.  The issue of attorney free speech,and especially one involving Rule 8.2, is ripe for another United States Supreme Court opinion reconfirming that attorneys have free speech rights that state bars must respect.   That protected speech must include the right of attorneys to criticize judges, especially elected judges, about their performance on the bench.</p>
<p>I have no doubt we will achieve success <em>if</em> we get the case to the United States Supreme Court and the Court agrees to hear the case.  The issue of attorney free speech uniites conservatives and liberals on the Court.  But an appeal to the Court is not cheap.  As a sole practictioner, I do not have the funds to finance this appeal by myself.  That's why I am asking for help from other attorneys and those interested in confirming the principle that attorneys do not give up their right to free speech when they are sworn into the bar.</p>

<p>Hello!  We are Quelab, Albuquerque’s nonprofit makerspace. Our mission 
is to foster and sustain an environment that promotes creativity, 
invention, and collaboration at the intersections of science, culture, 
art, and technology. Quelab is an all-volunteer member-run organization 
that operates a facility for anyone in the community to use. <br/><br/>We 
are well into our 3rd year of operations, and Quelab is really beginning
 to grow. In fact we’re bursting at the seams! Quelab version 1.0 can no
 longer support all the cool projects, educational workshops, and 
creative events that we have planned. We need to upgrade to a bigger 
space. Luckily, our New Location Task Force has found us an awesome 
building where we can relocate. Quelab version 2.0 will give our
 members, and the community, an enhanced creative outlet and an 
opportunity for continued growth. Please donate to this ""Moving 
Expenses"" fundraiser campaign and you too could take advantage of this 
amazing new location with all it has to offer.<br/><br/></p>
<h2>What to Expect in Quelab v2.0:</h2>
<p></p>
<p>With this new 
space we will finally have room for the professional grade tools that 
will set us apart from the average handy-man’s garage. We will be moving
 out of the ""frat-house"" and into a warehouse space that has room for 
long duration projects and more storage.  We will even have room for the
 plethora of parts and supplies that currently cover every available 
surface. </p>
<p>Additionally we will keep plenty of room for those with
 less messy projects. A space where they may hone their craft, without 
worrying about it getting covered in metal shavings, or drowned out by 
the drill press and band saw.  <br/><br/></p>
<h2>About this Campaign:</h2>
<p>To fund our move, we need a deposit and some additional capital for 
moving expenses.  The total comes to $4500.  This covers the moving 
truck(s), construction supplies, and cleaning for the old space.  In 
addition we need some extra funds to help defray the cost of renting 
both our current and new facility for the month of the move.  The specific break down of 
how we will spend these funds is as follows: <br/><br/>•        $1,500 for the deposit on the building<br/>•        $1,500 to pay the first month’s rent at the new space<br/>•        $500 for the physical moving expenses<br/>•        $400 to pay the first months utilities at the new space<br/>•        $400 for building supplies<br/>•        $200 to be used for incidentals<br/><br/>If
the satisfaction of donating in support of the Albuquerque maker community wasn't enough, 
we've added perks at 10 different donation levels.  Check them out on 
the right.  Please give generously to our campaign today, and then share
 this link with your friends and family! <br/></p>
<h2>Help Spread the Word!</h2>
<p>If a monetary contribution is out of the question for you, then consider
 an alternative means of support. Spread the word about this project on 
your favorite social network and share our project with everyone you 
meet. If you know anyone looking to maximize their charitable deduction 
on their taxes this year, keep Quelab in mind.<br/></p>

while abroad. Along with the classes, we are given the opportunity to go on weekend
ventures to experience Germany firsthand. I am also trying to travel around
Europe on my own to get the most out of my time there. However, I cannot afford
this on my own. That’s why I need your help, to offset some of the costs such
as airfare, housing, and other miscellaneous costs. </p>
<p>By making a contribution

<p>I'm getting close to realizing my dream: it's an amazing feeling to be almost there! Here's my story:</p>
<p>My name is Cade, I'm 26 years old, I live in Florida, and since as far back as I can recall I have wanted to work with exotic animals. Today, I'm a Zoology/Veterinary Science major focusing on exotic animal rehabilitation and am as excited as when I was a kid. Unfortunately, my journey was interrupted about 2 years ago.</p>
<p>In mid 2010, I developed a health problem. After several months and treatments/surgeries it was determined that the problem was actually an aggressive form of B Cell Lymphoma. It was a bigger problem than I was ready to tackle, but tackle it was the only choice. After a year of undergoing two different kinds of chemo, too many emergency hospital visits and set-backs, I am now on the road to recovery and back to pursuing my dream.</p>
<p>My campaign is simple: get me to Africa where I will have the opportunity to work with one of the world's formost experts on animal behavior. Kevin Richardson is respected around the world for his amazing work with the world's most exciting, dangerous, and misunderstood creatures. I have applied to work with him in South Africa in October of this year and have been accepted.</p>
<p>Having the opportunity to experience and learn in that environment will give me skills and knowledge unavailable in a classroom. Working with white lions, hyenas, and black leopards in their natural environment not only aids in their preservation but gives me the insight and skills to protect and rehabilitate some of the worlds most beautiful endangered species.</p>
<p>While at the preserve I will be building and maintaining habitats, preparing food, nurturing cubs, participating in perimeter checks for snares and poachers, site maintenance, and studying with Kevin Richardson to better understand his unique connection with these creatures.</p>
<p>I will include you in my adventure by blogging as frequently as possible and producing a beautiful 2013 calendar from the photos and journaling during my stay. I have arranged to blog/Skype with students and would be happy to add other schools and students to my list for those supporting my adventure.</p>
<p>I have raised a good bit of the necessary funding and have secured my place on the preserve, gotten my plane ticket, money for food and lodging, as well as necessary papers. I am in need of an additional $1500 to cover the costs of supplies and gear. It seems I need things that aren't amongst my belongings!!</p>

<p>""One World Welfare Org"" seeks to fund to help those in Pakistan who need it most- the homeless, the laborers, 
and all those who otherwise do not have the support they need to seek an
 education and empower women to raise their living standards in Pakistan.Many children in Pakistan have not been nearly as fortunate. Many mothers will never know the empowerment that education brings. Since finishing my own education, I have discovered a love for sharing knowledge with others. First, being a volunteer in Don Bosco, Quetta - and then as an elementary school teacher in Punjab and as a lawyer.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/639108/files/20140610104548-1236161_160337557502227_477823187_n.jpg?1402422348"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p>Through my work with young children, I discovered that I felt called to use education to try to bring real, lasting change to the kinds of opportunities that are available for children in my own country. I want to make sure that every child in Pakistan has an opportunity to experience the kind of life-changing education.<br/>Before I ask for you help, however, let me tell you a little more about my story and the current state of education in Pakistan so you can better understand where I am coming from and how deeply committed I am to seeing this through.</p><p><b>Our Background:</b></p><p><b>One World Welfare Organization (OWWO)</b> was established in 2009 with the goal of improving the lives of women and children in Pakistan 
through education. OWWO seeks to help those in Pakistan who need it 
most- the homeless, the laborers, and all those who otherwise do not 
have the support they need to seek an education. We worked on the 
educational needs of poor children; and second, empowering women to find
 and express their much needed voices in the community. Our educational 
goals enveloped the needs of children who, through necessity, became 
beggars, shoe-polishers, and laborers. In turn, they were poor, orphaned
 and from broken families.  </p><p><b>""OWWO""</b> is the Pakistani based volunteer charity Organization which alleviates the 
suffering of the poorest people of Pakistan. We supply the basic 
necessities of life together with education, medical and other 
assistance.Our main object is to uplift the demoralized and exploited 
community of the society and fight for their rights in Pakistan. In 
practice, it stretches its care to the poor and orphan children.We 
believe to ""help those in real need regardless of age,past 
life,race,color,caste and creed or religion and especially to children.""</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/713006/files/20140712115212-1236724_159604317575551_892589049_n.jpg?1405191132"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><b>The Challenge:</b></p><b>""OWWO""</b> is based in Youhanabad, Ferozepur Road, Lahore, in the province of Punjab, Pakistan. We established out first school in Youhanabad, a suburb there. When we first started, we only had 30 to 35 students. Since then, that number has risen to over 150. At the moment, we are renting a space to house the school. The fees are currently being covered by the Chairman of OWWO, Mrs. N.K. Gill; as well as donations from many generous individuals and families that see the good that our efforts bring. However, these donations are only enough to cover the bare minimum costs of running our one school.<br/>And so, this is where all of you come in. OWWO wishes to build a school- we need money to purchase land and pay for the construction of a facility that would have the space and resources to serve many more students than we do now.<br/><p><b><br/></b></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/713007/files/20140712115240-60601_162528477283135_725057533_n.jpg?1405191160"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>Our Solution / Your
Impact:</b></p><p>A new facility would allow us to support both children's education, as well as youth vocational training and adult education. We want to offer a wide variety of vocations, including computer courses, tailoring, cosmetology, and culinary skills. We want to offer cheap financing to our students for the purchase of equipment related to the skills they are seeking to develop. We want to enable these empowered women to pursue these careers by maintaining shops where they can exercise their new found skills and make money before they find work elsewhere.<b><br/></b></p>
<p>By
establishing ""One World Welfare School"" with afternoon session in addition to its morning session, the ""One World Welfare Org"" will be able to benefiting a grand total of 355 children in the 2015 school
year.  </p>
<p>Every dollar you give
will go towards funding our children,youth &amp; women  education program. We believe in
quality services to all children, regardless of income or race. The
student-driven learning approach, can have a powerful effect in high-poverty,
high need communities. We are confident that together we will transform the
lives of children and help build a brighter future for our community.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/692358/files/20140703110829-028.JPG?1404410909"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/665260/files/20140621144625-5844253.jpg?1403387185"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>Our Vision and Long
Term Goals:</b></p><p>We are tenacious in
maintaining the legacy of our founder, Mrs. N;k.Gill, to help our community
reach its full potential and fulfill its promise. We want to
cultivate the use of autonomy as a learning tool to empower children, women &amp; youth of all
backgrounds. We will do this by expanding our staff, offering enrichment
programs &amp; growing a community.</p><p>Moreover,We provide a comprehensive educational experience to all children regardless of their color, religion, caste or creed. We offer them an education with very low fees of about 100 PKR (that’s just over $1 US Dollar) per student; some are totally free. We also provide free books, bags, shoes and uniforms to the students who cannot afford them.In the interest of expanding to reach more children, we considered establishing our very own stand-alone building. For that, we moved forward and purchased some land. Now we need further financial support in the construction of a school.<br/>A number of students will be eligible for scholarships to put toward their studies. For the ineligible, we will arrange a small loan guarantee for their study fees, which they pay us back in installments. The terms and conditions for the loans will be simple. </p><p>As I mentioned above, the second part of the project is to empower the youth and provide them some trainings through which they earn a livelihood and help their families as well as themselves in their education. For that, we are going to open a training center for them in which we offer them an opportunity to train in areas such as: tailoring, beautician/make-up arts, and culinary skills. <br/></p><p>In the beginning, we will open a tailoring center for them. They will have a choice of three different diploma courses: one for 6 months, a year and 2 years. After completing their courses, we will help them in every conceivable way we can. The capacity of one badge is round about 50 students in a badge.</p><p>In the future, we intend to open a training boutique for them. The students of our institution work through their studies by making dresses. We will sell the dresses; 50% will go to the student dress makers and the other 50% to our NGO (One World Welfare). Upon course completion, many of the women could be provided their very own sewing machines. This will provide them the opportunity to earn money and slowly pay back the nominal tuition fee of the program and the machine.<br/>We will emphasize the successes as they happen, which will encourage more and more women and children to participate, as well.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/713041/files/20140712121441-10505591_300107093484664_6760356599225880318_n.jpg?1405192481"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><br/><b>Youth of ""OWWO""<br/></b></p><b></b><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/713050/files/20140712121817-083.JPG?1405192697"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>My Story </b><br/></p>I was born in Sialkot, Pakistan - the place that is famous for sports good, and being the town near the border of Jammu and Kashmir.

I deeply desire to be part of this kind of social change in my nation.I believe that creative, informed approaches that parallel the kind of work my parents &amp; uncle have done for the availability of resources in Pakistan can help make education available for the under-served children in my country.

""One World Welfare Org"" seeks to fund to help those in Pakistan who need it most- the homeless, the laborers, 
and all those who otherwise do not have the support they need to seek an
 education and empower women to raise their living standards in Pakistan.Many children in Pakistan have not been nearly as fortunate. Many mothers will never know the empowerment that education brings. Since finishing my own education, I have discovered a love for sharing knowledge with others. First, being a volunteer in Don Bosco, Quetta - and then as an elementary school teacher in Punjab and as a lawyer.Through my work with young children, I discovered that I felt called to use education to try to bring real, lasting change to the kinds of opportunities that are available for children in my own country. I want to make sure that every child in Pakistan has an opportunity to experience the kind of life-changing education.Before I ask for you help, however, let me tell you a little more about my story and the current state of education in Pakistan so you can better understand where I am coming from and how deeply committed I am to seeing this through.Our Background:One World Welfare Organization (OWWO) was established in 2009 with the goal of improving the lives of women and children in Pakistan 
through education. OWWO seeks to help those in Pakistan who need it 
most- the homeless, the laborers, and all those who otherwise do not 
have the support they need to seek an education. We worked on the 
educational needs of poor children; and second, empowering women to find
 and express their much needed voices in the community. Our educational 
goals enveloped the needs of children who, through necessity, became 
beggars, shoe-polishers, and laborers. In turn, they were poor, orphaned
 and from broken families.  ""OWWO"" is the Pakistani based volunteer charity Organization which alleviates the 
suffering of the poorest people of Pakistan. We supply the basic 
necessities of life together with education, medical and other 
assistance.Our main object is to uplift the demoralized and exploited 
community of the society and fight for their rights in Pakistan. In 
practice, it stretches its care to the poor and orphan children.We 
believe to ""help those in real need regardless of age,past 
life,race,color,caste and creed or religion and especially to children.""The Challenge:""OWWO"" is based in Youhanabad, Ferozepur Road, Lahore, in the province of Punjab, Pakistan. We established out first school in Youhanabad, a suburb there. When we first started, we only had 30 to 35 students. Since then, that number has risen to over 150. At the moment, we are renting a space to house the school. The fees are currently being covered by the Chairman of OWWO, Mrs. N.K. Gill; as well as donations from many generous individuals and families that see the good that our efforts bring. However, these donations are only enough to cover the bare minimum costs of running our one school.And so, this is where all of you come in. OWWO wishes to build a school- we need money to purchase land and pay for the construction of a facility that would have the space and resources to serve many more students than we do now.Our Solution / Your
Impact:A new facility would allow us to support both children's education, as well as youth vocational training and adult education. We want to offer a wide variety of vocations, including computer courses, tailoring, cosmetology, and culinary skills. We want to offer cheap financing to our students for the purchase of equipment related to the skills they are seeking to develop. We want to enable these empowered women to pursue these careers by maintaining shops where they can exercise their new found skills and make money before they find work elsewhere.
By
establishing ""One World Welfare School"" with afternoon session in addition to its morning session, the ""One World Welfare Org"" will be able to benefiting a grand total of 355 children in the 2015 school
year.  
Every dollar you give
will go towards funding our children,youth & women  education program. We believe in
quality services to all children, regardless of income or race. The
student-driven learning approach, can have a powerful effect in high-poverty,
high need communities. We are confident that together we will transform the
lives of children and help build a brighter future for our community.Our Vision and Long
Term Goals:We are tenacious in
maintaining the legacy of our founder, Mrs. N;k.Gill, to help our community
reach its full potential and fulfill its promise. We want to
cultivate the use of autonomy as a learning tool to empower children, women & youth of all
backgrounds. We will do this by expanding our staff, offering enrichment
programs & growing a community.Moreover,We provide a comprehensive educational experience to all children regardless of their color, religion, caste or creed. We offer them an education with very low fees of about 100 PKR (that’s just over $1 US Dollar) per student; some are totally free. We also provide free books, bags, shoes and uniforms to the students who cannot afford them.In the interest of expanding to reach more children, we considered establishing our very own stand-alone building. For that, we moved forward and purchased some land. Now we need further financial support in the construction of a school.A number of students will be eligible for scholarships to put toward their studies. For the ineligible, we will arrange a small loan guarantee for their study fees, which they pay us back in installments. The terms and conditions for the loans will be simple. As I mentioned above, the second part of the project is to empower the youth and provide them some trainings through which they earn a livelihood and help their families as well as themselves in their education. For that, we are going to open a training center for them in which we offer them an opportunity to train in areas such as: tailoring, beautician/make-up arts, and culinary skills. In the beginning, we will open a tailoring center for them. They will have a choice of three different diploma courses: one for 6 months, a year and 2 years. After completing their courses, we will help them in every conceivable way we can. The capacity of one badge is round about 50 students in a badge.In the future, we intend to open a training boutique for them. The students of our institution work through their studies by making dresses. We will sell the dresses; 50% will go to the student dress makers and the other 50% to our NGO (One World Welfare). Upon course completion, many of the women could be provided their very own sewing machines. This will provide them the opportunity to earn money and slowly pay back the nominal tuition fee of the program and the machine.We will emphasize the successes as they happen, which will encourage more and more women and children to participate, as well.Youth of ""OWWO""My Story I was born in Sialkot, Pakistan - the place that is famous for sports good, and being the town near the border of Jammu and Kashmir. In 1996, my family moved to the Lahore. There, my father started his practice in Lahore High Court as a Lawyer. When we moved to Lahore, we had a financial crisis earlier.From a young age, I learned from my parents the value and importance of equality for all people. As a successful Lawyer, my father and given my family a comfortable life. My Father  with his 2 Lawyer friends made a ""Christian Lawyer Association"" and he became the Chairman of Christian Lawyer Association. They fight for the rights of poor especially Christians in Pakistan.  Instead, my parents chose to stay and take a stand for our people. Through his selfless actions, and the lives he touched - I learned that what my nation needs most is people like him who will fight for what they believe in.Moreover, the work my parents have done has shown me the power to influence society in a constructive way. The power of being the change you want to see in the world. I deeply desire to be part of this kind of social change in my nation.I believe that creative, informed approaches that parallel the kind of work my parents & uncle have done for the availability of resources in Pakistan can help make education available for the under-served children in my country. It is also my hope that through the availability of education. The severe lack of education in Pakistan is causing increases in ignorance, discrimination and religious extremism. Since 2006 Pakistan has had an average of 30 bombings per year. Terrorist attacks on school but not a single damage in Punjab.Pakistan spends only 2.1 % of its GDP on education, in this budget they thinks to increase it, let see.Poverty is a big hurdle in education. According to UNICEF, 17.6 % of Pakistani children are working and supporting their families. Children working as domestic help is a common phenomenon in Pakistan, and this sector employs more girls than boys.I have many dreams and ideas for how I can bring change to Pakistan. Opening a welfare school based on educational best practices, teacher prep programs and eventually working alongside the government to influence decisions about education.By becoming a well-educated, empowered woman - I will be in a better position to help other women do the same as my mother did.By becoming a well-educated, empowered woman - I will be in a better position to help other women do the same.In general, i believe:By becoming a well-educated, empowered woman - I will be in a better position to help other women do the same.A chance to learn from some of the world's most gifted and knowledgeable educatorsA chance to learn how to navigate complex power structures and influence policy-level decision makingOpportunities and doors to opportunities that can help me transform education in Pakistan. A network of other highly motivated, gifted, well-connected education professionals whose experience, knowledge and talents I can call upon when needed.I may not be able to achieve my goal of opening a model school and transforming education in Pakistan immediately after graduation. Opportunities will present themselves in life that may offer a more realistic value proposition - for example working at an education NGO that is already deeply involved in a well-developed, hands-on educational reform program in another developing nation.

</div></div>","My Story


My name is Dominique Fishback, I am a 20 year old Acting
Major and Spoken word poet at Pace University in the Honors College.  I have 3 semesters left to finish my Bachelor of
 a Theater Arts degree with a minor in Arts and Entertainment Management. I am
launching this campaign to take my education into my own hands.  I am tired of hearing Financial Aid tell me
“You are closed out this semester,” “there’s nothing else we can do for you”
and “take out a loan,” – a loan the bank always denies. I think the saddest
thing is when a person, especially from “the hood” (a low income area) cries so
hard, not because of the living circumstances, or the police brutality, or
violence they face daily but because they have been told they do not have
enough money to get their college degree. I am that person because every
semester, after loans, I still have an $8,000 balance to pay out of pocket;
with three semesters to go, I need $24,000 to finish college.


To this point, I have made up the balance through performing
original poems.   Last May, I rode the
trains of NYC and did poetry to raise money. I have won several competitions,
and have also received tuition support from Tami and Shaunie from the Basketball Wives (http://www.vh1.com/video/misc/668270/project-girls.jhtml#id=1666500.)
Freshmen year, my uncle cosigned for a $30,000 loan and he cannot afford to do
it again. I have utilized every option and have no others to cover the next
three semesters; therefore, I am at risk of having to drop-out.  The success of this campaign would let me know
that every fight I’ve made to stay in college thus far and all the
accomplishments I’ve made through my academic career have not been done in vain.
I went to college because I knew that it was the best way to get started at a
career that would take me away from the everyday nonsense of my
neighborhood.  I was valedictorian in my
high school and got accepted into Pace as below average. However, I worked hard
and received a 3.8 GPA at the university, and got accepted into their honors
college. 


So far, at Pace I have had the opportunity to meet and
interact with people from different places in the world and of different
ethnicities. Because I am able to be in a college outside of Brooklyn, I have a
more open and diverse mentality. I now have a much greater appreciation of the world and
its many perspectives that I would not otherwise have. 


 
The Impact



By donating to my college education, this campaign will not
only help me, but have a powerful impact on many other people. Through my words
and experiences, and with the direction of a nonprofit theater organization called
Project Girl Performance Collective, (www.projectgirlperformancecollective.com)
which creates a safe space for young women to write and perform their own words,
I have learned and spoken out for the needs of impoverished girls worldwide.
Our performances and values are in such high demand that we have been
commissioned by the United Nation to perform on many occasions (including for
the Secretary General), tour nationally on their “Girl Up” Unite for Girls campaign,
and met with President Obama’s advisor to discuss our mission. At the end of
the day, I know that my voice and words no longer belongs to just me but to
anyone who believes in my advocacy. I write, perform, and speak “for the ones
who can’t, who won’t, the ones that don’t, the ‘doesn’t know how’s and the ‘too
scared to’ and the ‘I don’t have the same platforms you do.’


If this campaign is not successful, it will be harder to not
to be one of the many statistics in my neighborhood – stuck and lost. For 20
years, I have rejected the negative influences of my neighborhood and the
negative stereotypes associated with being from my neighborhood; I want to help
others do the same. There are many people who believe in me, and I really want
to make them proud.  The first step is
graduating from college.  I know I can
make it, but I need to finish what I started at Pace to be a successful
advocate for those without this opportunity.



 

What We Need & What You Get



I need to raise $ 24,000 in the next two months to ensure I
can graduate from the Honors College at Pace University -- $8,000 by December
31, 2011 for next semester alone. . If I don’t receive the full amount of
remaining tuition, I will create another campaign and try again.  But again, I must raise at least $8,000 by December
31, 2011 to stay in school next semester.

Fund Patrick Gibbs (US$500-800) to get on the LibreBus Cono Sur for two weeks, helping spread libre culture with an ecological awareness, and connecting first-hand with communities in Argentina and other LibreBus crew members to learn from their experiences and situation.
 
    (If you already think this idea seems wonderful, you can donate now! and/or email me: patricklibre-at-riseup-dot-net.)
 
A little more detail:
LibreBus Cono Sur is travelling through Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay with 20-ish people on board (called librenauts) participating in events about freedom of expression, free/open-access educational materials, freedom to share, free/libre/open-source software, biodiverysity, and gender. I met the LibreBus organizers at Hacks/Hackers Buenos Aires, said I wanted to join, and they invited me to participate in the final two weeks of LibreBus's route, as we recognize that my skills, experience, and perspective could add to the LibreBus project. They'll cover my expenses to participate, and that leaves me paying some related expenses, such as changing the date of my flight to the US, totalling US$ 500. If I receive more than $500, I'll put that money into followup, such as doing more LibreBus-themed events in Buenos Aires and Houston.
 
You can access the presentation directly if you want to see it at your own pace, instead of as a video -- change slides by clicking or with the arrow keys. I also translated the presentation to Spanish.
 

    (If you like the sound of this, you can donate now, and/or contact me.)

 
Cost details, in US dollars:

$300 to United Airlines, change flight to the US from September 12 to October 30.
$200, food, phone, and local transport during October

beyond $500:

$50, miscellaneous expenses during LibreBus trip
$50, photocopy fliers and informational pamphlets
$50, Internet hosting with May First / People Link, domain name registrations, email and VPN services from Riseup.net
$150, long distance bus travel to do events in Santa Fe province



beyond $800:

share funding with LibreBus project
spend money organizing ecologically-integrative free/libre culture events in Texas, maybe even a LibreBus.


If I don't reach my goal of $500, I won't get any money -- so if you want your donation to matter, spread the word so that we reach the goal, I get the money, I go on the LibreBus, I give you gifts, and I carry on the LibreBus project wherever I go next (probably Houston).
 
    (If this makes sense to you, you can donate now, and/or contact me.)
 
What I would do with LibreBus:

__ A workshop about appropriate technology and the Global Village Construction Set (Open Source Ecology) with teenagers at a rural school in José de la Quintana, Córdoba, north central Argentina.
__ Explain how May First / People Link functions as a democractic membership-based Internet services cooperative, and invite reflections and participation, with the purpose of catalysing an Argentine node of May First / People Link.
__ Explain the connections between cutural healing (which includes techniques such as co-counseling, popular education, power analysis, nature awareness) and free/libre culture (which includes software, art, books, videos, and more, with licenses that encourage sharing).
__ Spread my invitation to the free/libre culture community, and all people, to include in our sense of community the people who manufacture the computers that we use and that run the Internet, and to include the rivers and watersheds where computer-related mining, manufacturing, and dumping happen. In other words, as we create and use libre software, let's pay attention to what makes this possible, and let's use our intelligence to foster awareness, freedom, and responsibility throughout the cycle of producing, using, and recycling/dumping computers. See drafts in Spanish: Expandir estro Concepto de la Comunidad de la Cultura Libre and Mi Compu No Es Virtual.
__ Help translate LibreBus materials to English.

__ Apply my community living facilitation skills to LibreBus events, and to life on the bus. 
    (If this seems useful as a step forward in libre culture, you can donate now, and/or contact me.)
 
Why me:
I graduatedn 2011 with a BSc in Integrative EcoSocial Design from Gaia University (my portfolio). I worked with the University managing the website and designing the community and academic processes, and in 2009 I participated in a cooperative that ran the Ecovillage Training Center. Currently I work from a bioregional perspective, supporting the development of mutual support and education networks, focusing on cultural healing, environmental justice, and appropriate technologies.

<p>Since 1989, the <strong>International Youth Leadership Institute (IYLI)</strong>, a New York City nonprofit organization, has sponsored overseas study programs for African American and Latino high school students. This summer, students will study environmental science in Brasil and renewable energy in Senegal.Our campaign provides scholarships for students who otherwise wouldn't have this opportunity.</p>
<p><strong><em>IYLI's</em></strong> programs, in Africa and Latin America expose students to the world outside their community and empower them as global citizens, not only citizens of the Bronx, Harlem or other NYC neighborhoods. During a month overseas, they study language, science, government and community development, delve deeply into social and political issues, practice research skills, contribute as volunteers in their host community and explore international study and career options.</p>
<p>Unlike most international study programs for high school students, cost does not prohibit participation. Every student is funded based on need through organization, foundation and individual contributions. Since 1989, IYLI has extended the benefits of travel to hundreds of students who would not otherwise have had the opportunity. </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We have done an extensive review of international travel and study programs for high school students and they are expensive!  The average program cost is about $7,500, including airfare for 3-5 weeks.  Very limited scholarship help is available for students who want to participate.  The result:  international travel and study opportunities are largely available only to student from upper middle class or affluent families.  That leaves out most of the students we serve!</p>

Since 1989, the International Youth Leadership Institute (IYLI), a New York City nonprofit organization, has sponsored overseas study programs for African American and Latino high school students. This summer, students will study environmental science in Brasil and renewable energy in Senegal.Our campaign provides scholarships for students who otherwise wouldn't have this opportunity.
IYLI's programs, in Africa and Latin America expose students to the world outside their community and empower them as global citizens, not only citizens of the Bronx, Harlem or other NYC neighborhoods. During a month overseas, they study language, science, government and community development, delve deeply into social and political issues, practice research skills, contribute as volunteers in their host community and explore international study and career options.
Unlike most international study programs for high school students, cost does not prohibit participation. Every student is funded based on need through organization, foundation and individual contributions. Since 1989, IYLI has extended the benefits of travel to hundreds of students who would not otherwise have had the opportunity. 
What We Need & What You Get
We have done an extensive review of international travel and study programs for high school students and they are expensive!  The average program cost is about $7,500, including airfare for 3-5 weeks.  Very limited scholarship help is available for students who want to participate.  The result:  international travel and study opportunities are largely available only to student from upper middle class or affluent families.  That leaves out most of the students we serve!
We have kept our costs at $4,500 for four weeks and an additional 5-day pre-departure orientation. We have accomplished this through strong partnerships in our host countries and by identifying the most efficient options for transportation and housing.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Sarah. I'm a senior at a small private college in the Fingerlakes.  I've always had a passion for literature. After being really indecisive, I decided to become an English major (get all of your ""you'll be working at Starbucks forever"" jokes out). I'd really like to use my English degree to educate students, but not in a classroom setting. I really enjoy museums and how they curate art, literature, and history.</p>
<p>For my senior internship, I have decided to visit six literary museums across New England over a week. During this time, I will be seeing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two of Robert Frost's homes</li>
<li>Mark Twain's house</li>
<li>Harriet Beecher Stowe's home</li>
<li>Edith Wharton's house</li>
<li>Emily Dickinson's museum</li>
</ul>
<p>This trip will take me to Vermont, New Hampshire, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. At each of these museums, I will be studying how museums curate literature and learn about the different narrative styles presented by each museum. At the end of the trip, I will have completed a blog about the entire experience.</p>
<p>By helping fund my trip, you are not only helping me complete one of my last graduation requirements, you are helping me see a part of the country I've never been to, learn about the lives of authors that I would not normally be able to, and give me the opportunity to further my passion for museum education.</p>
<p>Your generous donation will be used to pay for gasoline and museum ticket cost ONLY. It will not be used for meal cost, lodging, or other personal costs.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>If I am able to raise $500, I will be able to pay for gasoline. Over 25 hours of driving go into this trip and gas isn't getting any less expensive unfortunately. In addition, your generous donation will pay for tickets so that I can fully experience each museum. Tickets cost up to $16 each. This is to see every part of the museum, which I would like to do rather than just being able to afford one part. </p>
<p>Note: My internship advisor will make sure that I use your donations ethically-- don't worry :)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I can't offer much incentive. However, you will be able to follow me on the blog I will be making about my trip, and I will be happy to thank each individual contributor on the page!</p>

Many years have passed since that time and our technology has advanced greatly, but space is still inaccessible for most people. Sending humans to space is very expensive and unmanned spacecraft, though cheaper, are still too costly for average citizens. The best way to learn about something is to go there, but if you can't go then the next best option is to send something there for you. We want to go to space, but without our own rocket and satellite our best option is to send a helium balloon with a camera and science instruments to the edge of space for us. We are hoping to record some amazing images and interesting scientific data from the upper layers of the atmosphere.</p><p>//        //         //</p><p></p><p><i>Mandare un essere umano nello spazio e poi sulla luna è uno dei più grandi traguardi mai raggiunti dall'umanità. Molti, anzi troppi anni sono passati da quell'evento grandioso e nonostante la tecnologia si sia evoluta notevolmente lo spazio continua a rimanere un posto inaccessibile per la maggior parte degli uomini. Infatti le spedizioni spaziali sono molto costose e anche le più economiche sonde e satelliti sono troppo costosi per un cittadino medio. Il miglior modo per imparare qualcosa è di combinare tra loro teoria e pratica e quando si parla dello spazio è molto difficile mettere in atto questa strategia ma è qui che inizia la nostra sfida.</i></p>
<p><i>Vogliamo andare nello spazio ma non possiamo farlo con un razzo con un satellite, quindi un pallone sonda con una telecamera e una buona strumentazione scientifica è la migliore opzione che abbiamo. Speriamo di registrare il prima possibile delle fantastiche immagini prese direttamente dallo spazio e dati scientifici dagli strati più alti dell'atmosfera.</i></p><br/><p></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>How to Get to Space</b></p><p></p><ol>
<li>Put electronics and camera in an insulated box</li>
<li>Attach to a large latex balloon filled with helium</li>
<li>The balloon ascends and expands as air pressure decreases</li>
<li>At around 30km the balloon is 6m in diameter and pops</li>
<li>The box with electronics comes down on a parachute</li>
<li>We use the GPS device to find and recover the payload</li>
<li>Time to watch a movie of space!</li>
</ol><div>      //         //        //</div><div>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li> Mettere i componenti elettronici, i gps e la telecamera in una scatola termicamente isolata a prova di urti<br/>
</li>
<li>Attaccarla ad un pallone sonda riempito con l'elio<br/>
</li>
<li>Dal momento che l'elio e' piu leggero dell'aria decollerà e mano a meno che salirà la pressione atmosferica diminuirà. Questo farà in modo che il pallone si gonfi e scoppi ad una certa altezza<br/>
</li>
<li>A Quest' altezza [ stimata intorno ai 30 km il pallone avrà un diametro di 6 m e scoppierà<br/>
</li>
<li>La scatola contenente la telecamera e gli strumenti ritornerà in modo sicuro sulla terra grazie ad un paracadute a cui e attaccata <br/>
</li>
<li>Tramite 3 dispositivi GPS saremo in grado di recuperare entro poche ore il pallone</li>

</div><p><b>Equipment for our Space Machine</b></p><p>With just €600 we can accomplish a single simple mission. With our €1500 goal we will be able to establish a small space balloon program with repeated launches. The difference is being able to buy more equipment and creating a more durable platform for future missions. The estimated costs for developing our space program:</p><p></p><ul>

<p></p><p></p><p></p><p><b>Purpose</b></p>
<p>The primary goals of this project are to get some cool videos from space and record basic scientific data from space, such as temperature and pressure, across various layers of the atmosphere. Along the way we also hope to be the first balloon launch from the grand <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piazza_Unit%C3%A0_d'Italia"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Piazza Unità</a> in Trieste.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Mission Objectives</b></p>
<p>To complete this project we will need to work on skills such as collaboration, manufacturing, and creating written documentation of the experiment so that we can contribute to the science of space balloons. Universities or other amateur groups of adults usually accomplish projects like this so this is quite an opportunity. With the work we have already accomplished and the great opportunity that this is we cannot let a lack of funding stop our project.</p>

Many years have passed since that time and our technology has advanced greatly, but space is still inaccessible for most people. Sending humans to space is very expensive and unmanned spacecraft, though cheaper, are still too costly for average citizens. The best way to learn about something is to go there, but if you can't go then the next best option is to send something there for you. We want to go to space, but without our own rocket and satellite our best option is to send a helium balloon with a camera and science instruments to the edge of space for us. We are hoping to record some amazing images and interesting scientific data from the upper layers of the atmosphere.//        //         //Mandare un essere umano nello spazio e poi sulla luna è uno dei più grandi traguardi mai raggiunti dall'umanità. Molti, anzi troppi anni sono passati da quell'evento grandioso e nonostante la tecnologia si sia evoluta notevolmente lo spazio continua a rimanere un posto inaccessibile per la maggior parte degli uomini. Infatti le spedizioni spaziali sono molto costose e anche le più economiche sonde e satelliti sono troppo costosi per un cittadino medio. Il miglior modo per imparare qualcosa è di combinare tra loro teoria e pratica e quando si parla dello spazio è molto difficile mettere in atto questa strategia ma è qui che inizia la nostra sfida.
Vogliamo andare nello spazio ma non possiamo farlo con un razzo con un satellite, quindi un pallone sonda con una telecamera e una buona strumentazione scientifica è la migliore opzione che abbiamo. Speriamo di registrare il prima possibile delle fantastiche immagini prese direttamente dallo spazio e dati scientifici dagli strati più alti dell'atmosfera.

How to Get to Space
Put electronics and camera in an insulated box
Attach to a large latex balloon filled with helium
The balloon ascends and expands as air pressure decreases
At around 30km the balloon is 6m in diameter and pops
The box with electronics comes down on a parachute
We use the GPS device to find and recover the payload
Time to watch a movie of space!
      //         //        //


 Mettere i componenti elettronici, i gps e la telecamera in una scatola termicamente isolata a prova di urti

Attaccarla ad un pallone sonda riempito con l'elio

Dal momento che l'elio e' piu leggero dell'aria decollerà e mano a meno che salirà la pressione atmosferica diminuirà. Questo farà in modo che il pallone si gonfi e scoppi ad una certa altezza

A Quest' altezza [ stimata intorno ai 30 km il pallone avrà un diametro di 6 m e scoppierà

La scatola contenente la telecamera e gli strumenti ritornerà in modo sicuro sulla terra grazie ad un paracadute a cui e attaccata 

Tramite 3 dispositivi GPS saremo in grado di recuperare entro poche ore il pallone
Godiamoci il nostro video spaziale!


Equipment for our Space MachineWith just €600 we can accomplish a single simple mission. With our €1500 goal we will be able to establish a small space balloon program with repeated launches. The difference is being able to buy more equipment and creating a more durable platform for future missions. The estimated costs for developing our space program:
Camera (€300)
Helium  (sponsored by SIAD in Muggia near Trieste)
Balloon (€100-250)
Parachute (€100)
Electronics and Radio (€300)
Construction Materials (€100)
GPS Tracker (€300)
//        //          //
Come potete facilmente intuire dal sito, questo progetto è troppo costoso per essere finanziato dalla scuola quindi abbiamo deciso di organizzare una campagna raccolta fondi. Con soli 600 $ saremmo gi' in grado di realizzare una missione come questa ma in scala ridotta mentre se raggiungessimo il nostro obiettivo *1500 $ saremmo in grado di ripetere il lancio piu volte con lo stesso pallone e di ordinare ovviamente componenti migliori

Ricapitolando ci servono:
300 $ per una telecamera in HD di buona qualità' che possa registrare per pi\ di 2 ore consecutive
Bombole di elio *già finanziati dalla SIAD con sede a Muggia in Trieste
100/250  $ per Il Pallone, piu soldi significa una migliore qualità' e stabilita della scatola e quindi niente tremolii nel video
100 $ per il paracadute, che e fondamentale per recuperare il tutto
300 $ per i componenti elettronici e la radio
100 $ per i materiali di costruzione *corde per tenere il tutto unito, protezioni contro gli urti ecc...
300 $ per i tracciatori GPS

About us
We are a group of students at the International School of Trieste (IST, and hence 'BalloonISTs') in Italy that have chosen to create a space balloon as part of our space architecture class, lead by our science teacher Mr. Bryan Costanza. He has a background in Aerospace Engineering and worked for a time at NASA so he knows quite a lot about spacecraft and weather balloons. //       //       //Siamo un gruppo di studenti della scuola superiore internazionale di Trieste e da qui il nome BalloonISTs che abbiamo scelto di costruire un pallone sonda 
Purpose
The primary goals of this project are to get some cool videos from space and record basic scientific data from space, such as temperature and pressure, across various layers of the atmosphere. Along the way we also hope to be the first balloon launch from the grand Piazza Unità in Trieste.

Mission Objectives
To complete this project we will need to work on skills such as collaboration, manufacturing, and creating written documentation of the experiment so that we can contribute to the science of space balloons. Universities or other amateur groups of adults usually accomplish projects like this so this is quite an opportunity. With the work we have already accomplished and the great opportunity that this is we cannot let a lack of funding stop our project.

<p><b>Our Campaign </b></p>
<p>Working with leaders in the reproductive rights movement,
the California Center for Research on Women and Families (CCRWF) is producing a
short video - less than 15 minutes - documenting the history of reproductive health services in
California.  The first release of the
film will be at the California Women’s Policy Summit, scheduled for January 16
at the Sacramento Convention Center (go to <a href=""http://www.ccrwf.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.ccrwf.org</a> for more information).</p>
<p>2014 is the 45th anniversary of legal abortion in California
– the perfect time to evaluate how far the movement has come and what
challenges remain in ensuring access to safe and effective contraception and
abortion services.  </p>
<p>The purpose of the video is to showcase the success we've
had here in California in securing rights and establishing programs, and to
honor the leadership that has brought about our relatively positive situation
in California (compared to many other states). </p>
<p>Given the many challenges to reproductive health services
across the country, the video will also serve another purpose – showcasing the
new and young leadership that will ""carry the torch"" forward, and
highlighting some of the ongoing challenges and struggles to achieve
reproductive freedom.</p>
<p>This short film will combine archival footage, first person
narratives and candid discussions with some of the leaders in the field in
California.  From a time when women
undergoing abortions could face jail time to more recent attacks on access to
contraception coverage and new evidence of forced sterilization of prisoners,
activists from diverse communities in the movement will provide their insights
into the powerful history of reproductive rights in California.</p>
<p>In addition to documenting this history for the first time,
this film will be used to brief boards of directors and educate students and

Why is this needed?
Here are some of the obstacles to reading and writing that I saw firsthand when I was teaching English composition at a Ghanaian high school:

Schooling is mostly in English, which is not their first language


Class sizes are much too big for students to get enough individual help
School libraries are inadequate, often consisting of a single bookcase full of the kind of books you couldn't even give away at your last garage sale.

African content is hard to find.

Most people don't read for fun, and they don't read stories to small children.

In spite of all this bad news, many Ghanaians have done extremely well. Ghana has produced plenty of successful newspapers, notable authors, and a vibrant home-grown TV and film industry. But many people are still excluded from the world of writing.The Good News

a place to meet with children
a computer lab
children who are eager to participate

Once the program is established, it can be run by international volunteers provided by Light For Children, so the ongoing costs will be minimal.
What We Still NeedOur goal is to raise $15,000 to cover these expenses:

Travel to Ghana

My name is Cathrine Yuill.  I live in Maitland, Nova Scotia: a small historical village known best historically for ship building and now as a spectacular location for viewing the world's highest tides and the tidal bore.  
For the last three years I have been working with a committee of friends, neighbors and colleagues to save our village school.  The demise of the small rural school is not a new issue.  Small schools are being closed all across North America and children as young as 5 are growing up on busses, being shipped great distances to consolidated schools far from their communities.
In facing our School Board's vote for closure of our school, we proposed an alternative: using the surplus space of our school for the creation of a Community Hub.  This Community Hub will aim to bring together small business and community services and supports to create both resource and opportunity.  The aim is to generate revenue to off set the amount of money the School Board would have saved by closing our school:  $130,000 per year.  This number may sound daunting but our committee has some excellent ideas which we think will go beyond saving our school and will even stimulate new economic activity in our community.  
What We Need & What You Get
 We are asking for your financial support to help us make this innovative solution a reality and possibly even an demonstration project for small rural communities all across North America. If we can do it, anyone can.  Contributions will fund our start up costs which include:
a feasibility study $3000
business plan development $4000
advertising for expressions of interest $4000
regional consultation meeting to bring together all the local area service clubs and services to develop integration. $1000
If we do not reach our goal we will scale back by doing a smaller feasibility study, by using reduced consultative services on business plan development, and attempting to do our regional consultation meeting at no cost.Donations of all sizes will be welcome.  Even $10 can help us to reach one more potential small business or innovator looking for space.
  The Impact The impact of this project will be significant:
keeping children in our community for elementary education, where we can all lend our skills, abilities, care and concern as they strive to excell.
stimulating economic activity in our region by brining in new businesses
bringing together a wide variety of community services in one central location
providing a demonstration for other communities facing the same plight

  Risks & Challenges  We face a number of risks:
low/declining student population
small resident population base
limitations of a volunteer time and energy during the development phase
decision-making power lies with external body - the local School Board
We feel that we are able to mitigate these risks.  We have everything we need as a community to stimulate population and economic growth.  This initiative will be one driving force among others currently at play including: provincial and small business investment in tourism, recent small business revitalization, in-migration of mid career families interested in lifestyle; strong and diverse skill base among community members, passionate interest in this cause from a large portion of the population.

The Team designed and right now is building its own near space instrumentation. </p>
<p>Earlier this year, in April we have already had a test-flight with the prototype of the telemetry system. Since then the Team developed a new revision of the flight computer and the capsule.</p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/772102/files/20140807073930-fogjuk.png?1407422370"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>The goals of our next misson:</b></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Take low resolution pictures and stream them back during flight</li>
<li>Take high resolution pictures</li>
<li>Measure temperature and pressure</li>
<li>Measure solar panel characteristics</li>
<li>Determine the trajectory of the probe</li>
</ul>
<p>The new flight computer is in production right now, the probe got its new insulation. Our vision is moving to the launch right now. The launch date is <i><b>13-September-2014.</b> </i>Our financial resources are depleted, so we need YOUR help to be able to keep on schedule with the launching.</p>

<h2>How can YOU help us? </h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We build the instrumentation, but it has to be delivered to its destination, to the stratosphere. The easiest way to get there is a Hydrogen or Helium filled balloon. </p>
<p>Every balloon launch has a cost built up from two major parts. The first part of the launch cost is one time investment. These are the launch site accessories like a small mobile shelter, balloon filling equipment and transportation containers for the accessories. These are durable equipment and can be used through many launches. It would be our second official launch and we only have the very basic equipment right now. With YOUR help, we could upgrade our accessories with a small wind shelter and a proper transportation box.</p>
<p>The other part of the launch cost is cover the consumables of the project like the filling gas and tank rental, lanyard of the payload, cost of the chase (petrol costs), mobile internet and phone costs and of course the weather balloon itself. These costs are applied for every launch and it is more or less constant. After we own the proper launch site equipment, the cost of a balloon launch will contain only the cost of these consumables.</p>
<p>This campaign is aimed at the acquisition of the cost of the balloon launch. The main goal is to purchase the two main ""launch consumables"", the weather balloon and the filling gas.</p>
<p>We are planned to use Helium. Of course Hydrogen would be cheaper, but we would need permissions to use, transport and buy it here in Hungary. Getting these permissions is long and sometimes expensive, so we choose Helium instead which is easier to get.</p>

<p>The weather balloon we planned to use is a 1000gr. or a 1200gr PAWAN latex balloon. This type has proven itself in our first test-flight and in the other balloon launches we contributed.</p>
<p>These items take the most of the cost. The rest of the founds will go to the launch equipment upgrade. We would like to purchase a proper container for the launch site equipment and the payload to be transported safely. The ideal transportation container has wheels and a divided interior where every accessory find its own place.</p>
<p>The other item we would like to purchase is a small mobile shelter that can be set up at the launch site and provides protection against wind and light rain. The ideal shelter has at least two ""walls"" and its entrance is big enough for an inflated 1200gr weather balloon to get out.</p>

About Our Indiegogo Campaign:  

We are raising money to fund outreach to thousands of schools across the USA, to enlist them to participate, classroom-by-classroom, or school-wide in our 'Bully Project Mural'. 

The 'Bully Project Mural’ is a digital destination where people of all ages can share their art, stories, and perspectives about bullying, its impact on our lives, and ideas for how we can #endbullying together.  Check it out now at: www.thebullyprojectmural.com. We built it together with Adobe and it allows anyone to express their memories or experiences of bullying, and by doing so transform them into a powerful and creative wall of empathy and action!

Our vision is that school participation in the Mural begins with a screening of the film BULLY, followed by classroom discussion using our curriculum or other resources, and concludes with the students developing their own contributions to the Mural. This model will help ensure that the work we do has maximum impact in helping to change school culture, which will be undertaken in a thoughtful and meaningful way. 

By donating to this campaign, you will be giving educators an opportunity to address the problem of bullying in a new way, and helping youth experience first-hand that they are not alone in being bullied or wanting it to end. Together, we can turn the tides on bullying. We like to think of the Mural as a modern version of the AIDS Quilt, a platform for creativity that can change hearts and minds globally.About Our Project:  The BULLY Project is a global movement inspired by the award-winning film BULLY.

The people of this village are the poorest of the poor and access to electricity is limited to those who may be able to run a generator for a few hours a day. Pomerini Secondary School reserves generator time for 7-10 pm so the students can study; but if a student needs to study later, or can't focus in the tiny classrooms packed with 50+ students, they have to rely on solar lights, which most cannot afford.  Those students are found many nights, sitting outside, attempting to study by the light of the moon.  With just a simple solar light, these student’s futures would be so much brighter! </span></p>

We can do more together than we can alone.

UPDATE: A generous investor has agreed to contribute $1,000 if we can reach 200 contributors to the campaign. Contributions of ANY AMOUNT count towards our headcount, so just $2 could mean $1002 for our work!!

Thousands of children are living in poverty in Nicaragua, the second poorest country in the Western Hemisphere.  We are here to change that, but we need you.

Spark Ventures is a Chicago-based non-profit that partners with international grassroots organizations to help children in poverty with education, nutrition, and healthcare.  Unlike most organizations, however, we don't believe in just writing a check.  

We call it business driven philanthropy.  


We invest time and resources into a new business opportunity.
The business creates local jobs & sustainable products.
The profits help support high impact programs to lift children out of poverty.

<p>As the father of 12+ children from birth, foster, and adoption, I have worked with both “at risk” children and parents, and I have had the opportunity to see the system in work.  I have noticed a severe gap in the support structure of the current system.  If an adult needs rehabilitation then the system steps in and puts the person in a facility that helps them change the habits that landed them there in the first place.  When this works, the system assists them with living arrangements and a monthly allowance for food and living expenses.  This welfare state is where a lot of them stagnate and basically live off the system for as long as possible.  Children born into this situation often repeat this pattern. A similar situation occurs with children brought into foster care as a teenager.</p>
<p>There are some individuals that, when in the situation where they are being supported by the system, decide that they want to make their own way.  They step out and try to make a go of it on their own.  Lacking the skills and/or education needed for a higher paying careers, they take the only thing available to them; minimum wage jobs.  This is where the system fails them.  If they earn enough of a wage on their own then they are no longer eligible for public assistance or public housing. The problem is that the line for how much they can earn is way below what it takes to actually survive and contribute to society.  It seems as if the system is set up to keep them from making the move to independence.   <br/><br/>  This is where we want to help.  We want to use a little bit more money and time to train “at risk” teens and rehabilitated adults in trade skills, arts, and crafts.  These skills will allow the newly trained to enter the job market with a set of skills that will allow them to provide for themselves.  The time and money used to train these individuals will help remove their need for public assistance.</p>
<p>We are looking for the startup capital to build the classroom, buy tools and materials, and to hire the trainers for the first round of training.  After the facility shows it can work, corporate and government grants will be resourced to continue the training. </p>
<p>Please donate what you can, share with others, and follow our progress.  I know a lot of people don’t want to support a cause until they see others doing it… Please be one of the ones that goes first.  Our community needs this.</p>
<b></b> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We need funding to acquire our work space and the tools needed to teach. Your contributions will go to the purchasing of a workshop and tools such as plasma cutters, welders, and similar.</p>
<p>Some things that will be awarded to contributors will be, bracelets, necklaces, free or reduced labor costs, and free lessons for you and your group. Rewards will be determined based on the quantity of the contribution. If you pass a particular checkpoint you will receive all previous awards in addition to that checkpoint.</p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>In our experience with foster care and rehabilitated adults we've noticed that the programs in place fall short. Foster Care and Rehab facilities give an individual support up until they begin to support themselves. Once someone begins to get back on their feet the support is pulled out from underneath them and they fall back into their old patterns. We want to bridge this gap, we want to give people an opportunity to learn a marketable skill so they can enter the workforce,support themselves, and become a contributing member of society. </p>
<p>One of our goals is to sell our crafted items at festivals, fairs, and conventions.  This will give the students the opportunity to sell their crafts and actually reap a reward for their work.  The plan is to ""lend"" the students the materials and location to work and then they only repay when the items sell.  Along with the crafting sales we plan on teaching some trade skills like auto maintenance, welding, and plumbing. Not only will this fill a need for the students, These ""blue collar"" jobs will help fill needs in the community also. <br/></p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>We realize that this goal is full of challenges. We know that despite our intentions we can't help everyone. In our minds it is worth the trouble to help one person better themselves.  We will need further funding in the future but plan on seeking federal, state and local grants along with commissions from paying customers. We also are working on getting non-profit charity status so the donations can be tax deductible.  We are fully aware that our skill sets may not fit all potential clients, but with the setup we are considering, there will be plenty of room for other professionals and tradesmen to come teach.</p>

<p>As you may or may not know, I was offered a special invitation to attend
the 2014 Global Leadership Awards in Washington D.C. </p>
<p> At this event, Vital Voices, an
organization that was founded 17 years ago Hilary Clinton and  Madeleine Albright,  will pay
tribute to visionary leaders on the front-lines of change who safeguard human
rights, combat corruption and ignite economic opportunity. </p>
<p>Through my community involvement and connections, the Northwest Chapter of
Vital Voices generously offered me a seat at the event, where I will get to
meet amazing women like Hillary Clinton and Madeleine Albright. </p>
<p>This is one of the most exciting opportunities I have received so far and

As you may or may not know, I was offered a special invitation to attend
the 2014 Global Leadership Awards in Washington D.C. 
 At this event, Vital Voices, an
organization that was founded 17 years ago Hilary Clinton and  Madeleine Albright,  will pay
tribute to visionary leaders on the front-lines of change who safeguard human
rights, combat corruption and ignite economic opportunity. 
Through my community involvement and connections, the Northwest Chapter of
Vital Voices generously offered me a seat at the event, where I will get to
meet amazing women like Hillary Clinton and Madeleine Albright. 
This is one of the most exciting opportunities I have received so far and
it’s so hard to let it go because of financial reasons.
Networking with high caliber and internationally focused professionals could
help me tremendously in shaping my career path and open doors for my next

</p><p>*Yes, we have exceeded the campaign goal, BUT it would be amazing to keep this momentum up and double it by the end of the campaign (July 30th)! The basic costs of the camp are now covered,  but now that I am on the ground in northern Lebanon I have identified a serious gap in funding to ensure the camp's lasting impact. YES the week-long camp is looking more and more like it will be an amazing experience for the children as well as the Syrian and Lebanese of all ages involved in terms of music, arts, recreation, environmental activities, teambuilding, cross-culture communication, etc. THAT BEING SAID one of the main objectives is to motivate children who are not in school (and haven't been since the beginning of the crisis in Syria!) and those struggling in school to take advantage or their current educational opportunities in a very self-empowering way. This will be accomplished through fun, engaging educational activities aimed to instill excitement and a more solid foundation in the French language (which the Lebanese curriculum uses). SO with the extra money raised after $6,000 we will be able to fund school-support classes to start after the camp and continue into the school year. These classes are taught by local Lebanese teachers who have already been hired and trained by R&amp;R. So PLEASE consider contributing and sharing this campaign widely so that together we can support a program dedicated to having a lasting impact on the future of Syrian refugee children that otherwise are at risk of becoming part of a ""lost generation"".</p><p></p><table><tbody>

</tbody></table><b>anything beyond $7,105 will go toward school support classes to continue through the school year ($320 / month).</b><br/><p><br/>And here is the original narrative for this project:<br/></p><p>Aid agencies have declared the
Syrian refugee crisis to be the worst humanitarian disaster in modern times. This
is an opportunity for you to directly contribute to the humanitarian response
to this disaster by supporting a summer program for youth in northern Lebanon.</p>
<p><b>Background</b></p>
<p>In many ways refugee youth are hit
the hardest in this crisis—having fled their war-torn country only a small
percentage of them are receiving education. Most suffer from conflict-related
trauma and their current living conditions leave little room for healthy
recreation and creative expression that can help them heal and grow. Syrian
families are scattered throughout the country and mixed into the already
diverse fabric of sectarian Lebanese society.</p>
<p>From 2013-2014, I
became intimately aware of these issues as I developed lasting relationships of
trust with both Syrians and Lebanese in northern Lebanon. I established a community-based environmental center (<a href=""http://www.facebook.com/AyounCenter"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.facebook.com/AyounCenter</a>) (with a grant from Davis projects for Peace  <a href=""http://www.davisprojectsforpeace.org/media/view/2912"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.davisprojectsforpeace.org/media/view...</a>) and was a volunteer with
the Belgian-based international NGO called Relief and Reconciliation for Syria,
or R&amp;R Syria (<a href=""http://www.reliefandreconciliation.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.reliefandreconciliation.org</a>).
</p>
<p>Together with my local partners and the support of R&amp;R, I have been
planning this summer camp and the local capacity-building involved with it. Now
I’m ready to travel back to Lebanon to fill the crucial role in putting it all
into action.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>What exactly will I be doing in Lebanon?</b>
</p><p>  If I
meet my goal in this crowdfunding effort, I will return to the north of Lebanon
in late July this summer. First I will continue to develop local volunteer groups
composed of Lebanese, Syrians, and internationals that I helped establish last
year. These groups will allow for dialogue and new understanding among the
people now living in the same village and facing the same systemic injustices
from governments and other agencies, and also form a committed and motivated support group to carry out the
six-day summer camp for children at the end of August. </p>
<p>The summer camp will involve 50-70
Syrian youth between the ages of 10 and 16. The
camp will focus on providing fun, educational outlets for Syrian youth in a
safe setting where they receive personal attention from leaders. Activities will
include interactive French and English education (to help them succeed in
school), music, theater, art, recreational activities, and environmental
education (hiking, treasure hunts, organic farming, rural food production,
natural sciences). There
will be at least two days when we take day trips out of the overpopulated and oftentimes chaotic village to the environmental center
and breathtaking natural surroundings to carry out activities there. </p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Where exactly will your money go? (see bottom for specific
breakdown)</b></p>
<p>The unparalleled severity of the Syrian crisis has come in
and out of the spotlight of mainstream media and many of us have probably asked
ourselves how we can help. This is an opportunity to bypass bureaucratic and
potentially tainted conventional aid avenues such that your money will go
directly to a project that <i>values lasting impact over temporary relief</i>. <br/></p><br/><br/><p>

anything beyond $7,105 will go toward school support classes to continue through the school year ($320 / month).And here is the original narrative for this project:Aid agencies have declared the
Syrian refugee crisis to be the worst humanitarian disaster in modern times. This
is an opportunity for you to directly contribute to the humanitarian response
to this disaster by supporting a summer program for youth in northern Lebanon.
Background
In many ways refugee youth are hit
the hardest in this crisis—having fled their war-torn country only a small
percentage of them are receiving education. Most suffer from conflict-related
trauma and their current living conditions leave little room for healthy
recreation and creative expression that can help them heal and grow. Syrian
families are scattered throughout the country and mixed into the already
diverse fabric of sectarian Lebanese society.
From 2013-2014, I
became intimately aware of these issues as I developed lasting relationships of
trust with both Syrians and Lebanese in northern Lebanon. I established a community-based environmental center (www.facebook.com/AyounCenter) (with a grant from Davis projects for Peace  http://www.davisprojectsforpeace.org/media/view...) and was a volunteer with
the Belgian-based international NGO called Relief and Reconciliation for Syria,
or R&R Syria (www.reliefandreconciliation.org).

Together with my local partners and the support of R&R, I have been
planning this summer camp and the local capacity-building involved with it. Now
I’m ready to travel back to Lebanon to fill the crucial role in putting it all
into action.What exactly will I be doing in Lebanon?
  If I
meet my goal in this crowdfunding effort, I will return to the north of Lebanon
in late July this summer. First I will continue to develop local volunteer groups
composed of Lebanese, Syrians, and internationals that I helped establish last
year. These groups will allow for dialogue and new understanding among the
people now living in the same village and facing the same systemic injustices
from governments and other agencies, and also form a committed and motivated support group to carry out the
six-day summer camp for children at the end of August. 
The summer camp will involve 50-70
Syrian youth between the ages of 10 and 16. The
camp will focus on providing fun, educational outlets for Syrian youth in a
safe setting where they receive personal attention from leaders. Activities will
include interactive French and English education (to help them succeed in
school), music, theater, art, recreational activities, and environmental
education (hiking, treasure hunts, organic farming, rural food production,
natural sciences). There
will be at least two days when we take day trips out of the overpopulated and oftentimes chaotic village to the environmental center
and breathtaking natural surroundings to carry out activities there. 
Where exactly will your money go? (see bottom for specific
breakdown)
The unparalleled severity of the Syrian crisis has come in
and out of the spotlight of mainstream media and many of us have probably asked
ourselves how we can help. This is an opportunity to bypass bureaucratic and
potentially tainted conventional aid avenues such that your money will go
directly to a project that values lasting impact over temporary relief.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>This campaign marks the launch of the Japanese Earthen Plaster
Exchange, a project to support and spread Japan’s rich tradition of earthen
architecture</b>. The <a href=""http://www.thejepe.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">JEPE</a> will send three craftspeople from the U.S. to Japan to study
under experts in the ancient tradition of Japanese plastering which, using
earth and straw, has produced the walls of enduring castles, peaceful temples,
and simple elegant tea houses for many centuries. These earthen walls have a modern sensibility,<b> </b>masking the ages-old skill involved in
their creation.  That’s the beauty of it.  You can't tell it's clay,
but it is.<span> And the use of
earth has many beneficial consequences for our health<i>.</i>  It feels
wonderful to be inside these health-giving spaces.</span></p>
<p><b>Essentially, we want to bring the outdoors in for everyone.</b>  Scientific
studies show that clays hold negative ionic charges, and we know that we need
negative ions for optimal health.  <a href=""http://www.nikkensleepcenter.com/information/NRI_negative-ion.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">This research article</a> does a good
job of gathering studies that have recognized various benefits, from fostering simple feel-good sensations to
actually enhancing our immune system.  We gain these benefits when earthen
plasters are the skins of our rooms, releasing negative ions into the air as
they absorb moisture from our daily activities.</p>
<p>While the existence of an earthen plastering tradition is
largely unknown outside Japan, it unfortunately is nearly obsolete in its
industrialized homeland.  There is an urgent need to learn to use the
tools and techniques of Japan’s earthen plastering tradition, and share them
with the West's building trade.  We believe that Japanese-style earthen
walls will appeal to the Western public.  By increasing exposure to these
beautiful earthen surfaces, and making ""earthen plasters"" a household
term,<b> we can help soothe the
anxiety that pervades our modern age, and improve individual health.</b>  </p>
<p>The results of our training can also improve upon<b> Japanese gardens in the U.S.</b>, whose structures too
often lack the authentic surfaces which are traditionally a defining
characteristic of these serene spaces.<span>  The healing qualities of these gardens will
be enhanced by ensuring this aspect is not missing.</span></p>
<p><b>Please visit </b><a href=""http://www.thejepe.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>our website </b></a><b>for further details of the project's health benefits, its motivations, and its team members. </b></p>
<p>Thanks to swift and generous supporters, we have reached
our primary goal of raising $1,000 for our first campaign.  The purpose of
this campaign has been to fulfill our sponsor Fractured Atlas’s requirement: to
prove there is a public out there who wants our project to succeed.  Securing
grants will be critical in raising nearly $250,000, the amount we need to
comply with Japan’s visa restrictions during our training.<span>  Now that we have reached our initial goal of
proving public support, we have the green light to approach grant-makers (<strong>THANK YOU!</strong>).  <b>From this point, the more we raise,
the more we demonstrate we are embarking on a worthy and important mission
recognized by the public: you.  And we want to know who, and how many of
you, there are!  Just a $1 donation from each of you will help make that
happen.</b></span></p>
<p><b>TRAINING: </b>Emily will begin a
two year apprenticeship in Kyoto in April 2016, with Shikkui Asahara, a company
that works exclusively with traditional methods and materials, primarily to
maintain cultural heritage structures.  That October, Wolfgang and Angela
will begin a full-time six-month training program at a plaster school in Kyoto,
the only school in the country that offers training in traditional earthen techniques. 
During this time and after their course, they will also
seek to connect to, and learn from, earthen builders practicing actively in
Japan.<b>  Upon returning</b> to the
U.S. all three of us will integrate this experience into our own work.  We
will utilize public media and hold workshops to spread this knowledge both
within the mainstream building industry and among the tight-knit, and only
three-decades-young, natural building community. We will build bridges so others can access
this knowledge directly, and spread the benefits of earthen plasters.</p>
<p><b>Your support fuels our success.  Every contribution counts,
and is deeply appreciated.</b></p>
<p>May you know the joy of earthen plasters.</p>

</p></div>","This campaign marks the launch of the Japanese Earthen Plaster
Exchange, a project to support and spread Japan’s rich tradition of earthen
architecture. The JEPE will send three craftspeople from the U.S. to Japan to study
under experts in the ancient tradition of Japanese plastering which, using
earth and straw, has produced the walls of enduring castles, peaceful temples,
and simple elegant tea houses for many centuries. These earthen walls have a modern sensibility, masking the ages-old skill involved in
their creation.  That’s the beauty of it.  You can't tell it's clay,
but it is. And the use of
earth has many beneficial consequences for our health.  It feels
wonderful to be inside these health-giving spaces.
Essentially, we want to bring the outdoors in for everyone.  Scientific
studies show that clays hold negative ionic charges, and we know that we need
negative ions for optimal health.  This research article does a good
job of gathering studies that have recognized various benefits, from fostering simple feel-good sensations to
actually enhancing our immune system.  We gain these benefits when earthen
plasters are the skins of our rooms, releasing negative ions into the air as
they absorb moisture from our daily activities.
While the existence of an earthen plastering tradition is
largely unknown outside Japan, it unfortunately is nearly obsolete in its
industrialized homeland.  There is an urgent need to learn to use the
tools and techniques of Japan’s earthen plastering tradition, and share them
with the West's building trade.  We believe that Japanese-style earthen
walls will appeal to the Western public.  By increasing exposure to these
beautiful earthen surfaces, and making ""earthen plasters"" a household
term, we can help soothe the
anxiety that pervades our modern age, and improve individual health.  
The results of our training can also improve upon Japanese gardens in the U.S., whose structures too
often lack the authentic surfaces which are traditionally a defining
characteristic of these serene spaces.  The healing qualities of these gardens will
be enhanced by ensuring this aspect is not missing.
Please visit our website for further details of the project's health benefits, its motivations, and its team members. 
Thanks to swift and generous supporters, we have reached
our primary goal of raising $1,000 for our first campaign.  The purpose of
this campaign has been to fulfill our sponsor Fractured Atlas’s requirement: to
prove there is a public out there who wants our project to succeed.  Securing
grants will be critical in raising nearly $250,000, the amount we need to
comply with Japan’s visa restrictions during our training.  Now that we have reached our initial goal of
proving public support, we have the green light to approach grant-makers (THANK YOU!).  From this point, the more we raise,
the more we demonstrate we are embarking on a worthy and important mission
recognized by the public: you.  And we want to know who, and how many of
you, there are!  Just a $1 donation from each of you will help make that
happen.
TRAINING: Emily will begin a
two year apprenticeship in Kyoto in April 2016, with Shikkui Asahara, a company
that works exclusively with traditional methods and materials, primarily to
maintain cultural heritage structures.  That October, Wolfgang and Angela
will begin a full-time six-month training program at a plaster school in Kyoto,
the only school in the country that offers training in traditional earthen techniques. 
During this time and after their course, they will also
seek to connect to, and learn from, earthen builders practicing actively in
Japan.  Upon returning to the
U.S. all three of us will integrate this experience into our own work.  We
will utilize public media and hold workshops to spread this knowledge both
within the mainstream building industry and among the tight-knit, and only
three-decades-young, natural building community. We will build bridges so others can access
this knowledge directly, and spread the benefits of earthen plasters.
Your support fuels our success.  Every contribution counts,
and is deeply appreciated.
May you know the joy of earthen plasters.

<p>The learning tangram is a game and tool that realizes that learning is a fluid and always changing process.

<p>The Learning tangram can also be used <b>during course</b>: when you want introduce the learning topic in an unconventional way; or just use it to reflect about the different learning styles.</p>
<p>Use the Learning Tangram <b>after the course</b>: when you want to evaluate a learning activity or why a training has perhaps not had the impact hoped for. </p>

The learning tangram is an easy visual tool to reflect about learning.  Learning tangram invites you to sit calmly and reflect about the relationship between learning and space in a playful way. 
One of the previous project I worked on was the creation of the Compass Card Decks. This is a portable set of cards that collect 60 participatory knowledge methods that trainers can use during training.  Following on this project, I tried to organize all the information that I've collected in a new participatory game that permits to reflect about learning style and spaces.
I like a visual style of learning.

I was curious to visualize what kind of learner I was.  I understood how I liked to learn and how various different approaches appealed to my sensitivities but did not have an effective way to visualize this.  I developed the learning tangram as a tool to help me achieve this.
Learning Tangram represents a new way for considering the role of different learning aspects such as space and environment, issues that are often superficially overlooked.Instead of having to read a manual or paper, the Learning Tangram invites you to reflect about and then visualize your personal relationship with how you learn.
How does it work?


How I visualized my learning needs:


While I was studying Architecture at Politecnico di Milano I found myself in a really creative space.  When designing the Learning Tangram I wanted to visualize my learning experience during this time.
So, I took the Learning Tangram and I started to play. First I paired each learning aspect with a shape in the tangram, then I ordered the shapes according to which aspects most reflected how I like to learn.

When I had finished I had the discovered the seven shapes that best respested the way I liked to learn.  I then began arranging the shapes I had selected into a design that I could allow me to visualise how I liked to learn. I moved the seven elements around the table in several different combinations.  Finally the seven elements came together into the shape of a home, this reminded me of my studies in architecture and I felt I had discovered the perfect visual representation of how I like to learn.



When can I use the Learning Tangram? 

The learning tangram is a game and tool that realizes that learning is a fluid and always changing process. Different people learn in different ways and understand how you learn is key to success.  Its purpose is to figure out how people perceived the educational process, and at the same time, embrace or create new learning patterns.  And it is fun. The Learning Tangram can be used by anyone but is primarily aimed at people involved in educational process: students, learners, teachers and trainers.  In this context it would be perfect for workshops and team sessions.For example, the Learning Tangram activity could be used before a training course as a means to establish what kind of learners are going to be attending and which methods are likely to achieve the best results.  
The Learning tangram can also be used during course: when you want introduce the learning topic in an unconventional way; or just use it to reflect about the different learning styles.
Use the Learning Tangram after the course: when you want to evaluate a learning activity or why a training has perhaps not had the impact hoped for. 
Now it is the time to play. 


Learning updates: 

As an added value to the campaign I will be offering ongoing updates about my research on the role of physical space and the learning process. During the campaign period you will be able to attend five micro lessons on the following topics:

What does the Learnscape mean?
How learning is changing. From formal models towards informal patterns.
The third trainer. Why and how space affects learning.
Design with patterns. The architectural pattern
Build a new learning environment. Tips and tools. 



What We Need & What You Get

Everything is ready: I have the mock-up and the instructions booklet. But this kind of product really needs an high quality production that will last around two months: then I'll start to pack and ship in order to let you receive your Learning Tangram around the middle of February.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div>I am the recent recipient of the Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching, representing New York State. As a kindergarten teacher who brings paleontology into my classroom through research and a simulated dinosaur dig each year based on my own experiences in the field, I realize there is a great need to provide young children with early exposure to science concepts that integrate many disciplines, including technology, engineering, and mathematics.

<h3>The Need</h3>
<p>Science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) are becoming increasingly important in today's career paths but Dallas students are still struggling to reach proficiency with these subjects. According to 2013-2014 scores:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>An average of 36% 6th garde students are partially or not proficient in math</li>
<li>An average of 38% 8th grade students are partially or not proficient in science</li>
<li>Averages are even worse in select North Texas Counties</li>

</div></div>","We are seeking funding to expand our current ""Minds That
Matter"" youth Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) program which is a part of our DFW Technical Outreach
Community Help (T.O.R.C.H.) Center. The program is designed to cultivate the minds
of youth, grades 6 through 8, in the areas of STEM leadership development and public speaking. The approach to
reach this goal will include: Skills assessments, academic counseling and
mentoring, exposure to strategic thinking methodologies and different levels of
recognition. The program is designed to excite student's interest in career
fields that they may not otherwise consider viable. Weekly sessions/workshops are held at our center and meals are provided to all students.



Sample Curriculum 
 



Construct a Truss Bridge (Civil Engineering)
Efficiency Improvement of Systems (Industrial Engineering)
Make an Electromagnet (Electrical Engineering)
Internal Combustion Engine (Mechanical Engineering)
Model Airplanes/Rockets (Aerospace Engineering)

Hydrodynamic Building Set (Environmental)








Metrics: Information regarding the demographics of participants are collected at each session and signed by parents/guardians. We also gauge how much students have learned by administering a pre-test and post-test at every workshop/session. These results are then compiled, analyzed and used to modify various components of the applicable curriculum topic. In the future we plan to work closely with Dallas Independent School District (DISD) administrators to collect student academic report cards for further tailor the program to meet the needs for our student participants.



Each month will also include a workshop
for students regarding career searches, college prep, standardized testing exam
prep., and presentation skills. With the support of the NSBE Alumni Chapter membership each student will also have the opportunity to
meet with a professional in their field of interest. Our members work for companies such as Lockheed Martin, Texas Instruments, 3M, Boeing, Chevron, Google, and Dell.

<p>Foothills Fest 2014 aspires to be more than an event. This
festival has been created to help growth within the community, both creatively
and economically. We are a community of young artists and entrepreneurs willing
to go the extra mile in order to benefit the place we call home. </p>
<p>With generous contribution opportunities available, we have
set this event up to bring in as many small, local businesses as possible,
as well as increasing the communication between small businesses. Better
communication leads to better opportunities for growth, which will benefit both
the community and the business community. Foothills Fest is important to everyone
involved. It gives us the chance to team up and share the same goal:  Raise awareness on supporting local
businesses, and helping each other. Let's help small business grow!</p>
<p>Contributors aren't just donating to obtain the perks.
They're getting directly involved with the economic and creative growth of the
community we call home. We are not just creating a one-day event for people to
enjoy, we are creating a one-of-a-kind networking opportunity for small
businesses to get involved and reap the benefits. The benefits are endless.</p>
<p></p><p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>We have set our IndieGoGo goal at $10,000 to insure our bare
minimum expenses, but to also give the community of Marshall another way to
help contribute and be a part of the growth of the town’s culture. The overall

Foothills Fest 2014 aspires to be more than an event. This
festival has been created to help growth within the community, both creatively
and economically. We are a community of young artists and entrepreneurs willing
to go the extra mile in order to benefit the place we call home. 
With generous contribution opportunities available, we have
set this event up to bring in as many small, local businesses as possible,
as well as increasing the communication between small businesses. Better
communication leads to better opportunities for growth, which will benefit both
the community and the business community. Foothills Fest is important to everyone
involved. It gives us the chance to team up and share the same goal:  Raise awareness on supporting local
businesses, and helping each other. Let's help small business grow!
Contributors aren't just donating to obtain the perks.
They're getting directly involved with the economic and creative growth of the
community we call home. We are not just creating a one-day event for people to
enjoy, we are creating a one-of-a-kind networking opportunity for small
businesses to get involved and reap the benefits. The benefits are endless.
What We Need & What You Get

We have set our IndieGoGo goal at $10,000 to insure our bare
minimum expenses, but to also give the community of Marshall another way to
help contribute and be a part of the growth of the town’s culture. The overall
budget we need to make this year’s Foothills Fest all that it can be is
$15,545. The amount we’ve set for ourselves would allow us to fully use our
resources and supply the event with entertainment, day-long activities, food
& refreshments, merchandise, and much more. We also have to take into
account the magnitude of an event like this, with costs of insurance, venue,
and utilities. Even if we don’t reach our goal of $10,000, we will prioritize
costs and all money contributed will be a huge help in making Foothills Fest
happen!

believer in <b>doing</b>. Theory is great,
but it doesn’t help students unless you put it into action. So I founded Yellow
Wood with a vision—to provide an educational setting where young people can
start <b>discovering their real talents</b>
in a less stressful environment. No grading, no ranking, more thinking, less
memorization, more guidance, fewer rules. A place where teens don’t just learn,
they thrive.”                                                                     <br/></p><p>                                                                                        ~ Judith Hurst, Founder<br/></p><span style=""font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 1.45em;""><p>Let’s be honest—the traditional
school model isn’t working for many young people.Yellow Wood Learning Community is
different, and we’re making a difference. We’re a 501c(3) nonprofit organization designed to further the education
and goals of 13- to 18-year-olds who want to learn and explore ideas in a
setting other than the traditional school model.</p>
<p>Yellow Wood's founder,
Judith Hurst, is a lifelong educator. During her many years of teaching,
she encountered systemic challenges in both public and private schools—high-pressure
standardized tests, lowest quartile stigmas, inflated grades. <i>All that
judgment. Yuck</i>! <span style=""font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 1.45em;"">

<p>In the summer of 2012, Judith
attended the Alternative Education Resource Organization (AERO) conference for
the first time. At AERO, she found what she was looking for—fellow
educators who were passionate about transforming education, and were <b>taking action</b>. Free schools,
alternative schools, and thriving, successful models such a North Star Teens
inspired her to begin Yellow Wood in her own community.</p>
<p>In addition to Yellow Wood’s
full-time program, Judith's long-term vision includes workshops after school
for <b>all</b> teens in the community. Tai
Chi, Tango, Poetry … the sky's the limit!</p>
<p>A National Board Certified
Educator (English), Judith holds a Master’s degree in Educational Psychology
and is a lifelong learner. She oversees all aspects of the learning community,
and facilitates classes in Literature, Writing, Poetry, Photography, Creative
Commerce, and Philosophy. <br/></p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/507836/files/20140414123952-Screen_Shot_2014-04-14_at_2.44.17_PM.png?1397504392"" src="""" style=""width: 292.9px; height: 87px;""/></p><p></p><h3><span><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/512758/files/20140416080511-IMG_8918.JPG?1397660711"" src="""" style=""""/></p></span></h3>
<p>Our 501c3 nonprofit education resource center is open
Monday through Friday, offering classes, self-directed learning, tutoring, games,
community meetings, and more.</p>
<p>One student may be in class
studying literary allusions, while another is getting private SAT help. One
morning, we may all be working together to design and paint an incredible mural. Afterward, several students might head to a local
farm to volunteer, learning about animal husbandry and organic farming. </p>
<p>Each teen has an individualized
schedule. While we offer traditional classes such as Geometry, French,
Chemistry, and Writing, Yellow Wood also offers classes you wouldn't normally
find in a traditional school, including Recon (a class where discarded
materials are re-purposed and re-imagined into furniture and other objects)
Skateboarding, Cosmetics, Special Effects, Raspberry Pi computer building and
coding, and the Sociology of Animated Television Shows.</p>

believer in doing. Theory is great,
but it doesn’t help students unless you put it into action. So I founded Yellow
Wood with a vision—to provide an educational setting where young people can
start discovering their real talents
in a less stressful environment. No grading, no ranking, more thinking, less
memorization, more guidance, fewer rules. A place where teens don’t just learn,
they thrive.”                                                                                                                                                             ~ Judith Hurst, FounderLet’s be honest—the traditional
school model isn’t working for many young people.Yellow Wood Learning Community is
different, and we’re making a difference. We’re a 501c(3) nonprofit organization designed to further the education
and goals of 13- to 18-year-olds who want to learn and explore ideas in a
setting other than the traditional school model.
Yellow Wood's founder,
Judith Hurst, is a lifelong educator. During her many years of teaching,
she encountered systemic challenges in both public and private schools—high-pressure
standardized tests, lowest quartile stigmas, inflated grades. All that
judgment. Yuck! 

In the summer of 2012, Judith
attended the Alternative Education Resource Organization (AERO) conference for
the first time. At AERO, she found what she was looking for—fellow
educators who were passionate about transforming education, and were taking action. Free schools,
alternative schools, and thriving, successful models such a North Star Teens
inspired her to begin Yellow Wood in her own community.
In addition to Yellow Wood’s
full-time program, Judith's long-term vision includes workshops after school
for all teens in the community. Tai
Chi, Tango, Poetry … the sky's the limit!
A National Board Certified
Educator (English), Judith holds a Master’s degree in Educational Psychology
and is a lifelong learner. She oversees all aspects of the learning community,
and facilitates classes in Literature, Writing, Poetry, Photography, Creative
Commerce, and Philosophy. 
Our 501c3 nonprofit education resource center is open
Monday through Friday, offering classes, self-directed learning, tutoring, games,
community meetings, and more.
One student may be in class
studying literary allusions, while another is getting private SAT help. One
morning, we may all be working together to design and paint an incredible mural. Afterward, several students might head to a local
farm to volunteer, learning about animal husbandry and organic farming. 
Each teen has an individualized
schedule. While we offer traditional classes such as Geometry, French,
Chemistry, and Writing, Yellow Wood also offers classes you wouldn't normally
find in a traditional school, including Recon (a class where discarded
materials are re-purposed and re-imagined into furniture and other objects)
Skateboarding, Cosmetics, Special Effects, Raspberry Pi computer building and
coding, and the Sociology of Animated Television Shows.



We don’t receive federal funding,
and we don’t have pots of gold—we’ve looked! 
Diversity and opportunity are
extremely important to us, and we operate on a (sometimes frighteningly) tight
budget so that we can open our doors to every eligible student. Many families
can’t afford membership fees. 
With sufficient funds, we’re also
hoping to offer a summer program for all interested teens, making the Yellow Wood
model of learning and exploration available to everyone, even students who
attend traditional schools. 

Your contributions support an organization that puts
students first. Here’s some of what we do. 
We offer:
·  An enriching environment for
in-depth exploration of skills and ideas

• 
A free and open
space to make every student’s voice heard.
• 
Weekly
workshops led by a variety of professionals from the community, including the
renowned Julia Perlowski's Macbeth Workshop, and the remarkable musician
Richard Brookens' World Music demo day.• 
Drawing and painting classes where students learn about everything from elements of art such as textures, value, color, space to implementing these to caricature, tattoo art, and skateboard design. 
•  
Socratic dialogues about everything from applying
Upton Sinclair's argument in The
Jungle to today’s globalized and modern economy to asking what it
means to be a young female in America
• 
 

Our budding community arts program, which has painted abstract murals and
dabbled in projects for Animal Hero
Kids, an organization dedicated to using humane education tools to create
more compassion and empathy toward all animals  
·  A mentoring program to ensure each student receives individualized guidance
· 
Location Learning Trips—we’ve explored
alternative healing at Thrive Alternative Medicine, studied Piotr Uklanski’s
work at the Bass Museum of Art, and visited the Stonewall Museum after
researching the history of the LGBT community

•  
Project-Based Learning—so far, we’ve studied
the architectural influences behind the sustainable Earthship buildings in a
local Maker Space garden, designed and crafted for-sale products in our
Creative Commerce class, and contributed to the Broward County Environmental
Agency’s dune restoration project at John U. Lloyd Park

<p>“Attending Lyra was one of the most inspirational,
transformative, and exciting experiences I have ever had.  Playing music and being with some of
the nicest, funniest students, and most supportive staff members changed how I
felt about myself and my life. 
What was even more amazing for me was the way my progress was appreciated.
The excitement and encouragement of the staff helped me to enjoy playing and performing,
because I felt conﬁdent instead of scared or unhappy with my playing. It was
incredibly freeing to work hard, and then ﬁnd happiness in the result.”  --  Ella, Lyra scholarship student<br/></p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>In 2010, two old friends, both pianists, teachers, and graduates from Manhattan School of Music, got together for a friend's birthday and started talking about teaching piano.  We, Mary Prescott and Akiko Sasaki, discussed how we wanted to keep up the momentum of learning piano despite the busy schedules of our students, and wished that there was some way that we could work with them on a daily basis.  We wanted to show our students how much potential they truly possessed, and how much they could improve in a short time.  A lot more discussion and a day later, we started taking our first steps toward the Lyra Summer Music Workshop.</p>
<p>Now in our 6th season, the Lyra Summer Music Workshop has been operating in beautiful Randolph, VT, where string and piano students of any age or level come to immerse themselves in a supportive yet intensive conservatory-style music camp. Along with daily private lessons and chamber music coachings, Lyra rounds out the days with group classes, performances, and social recreation. We also host a concurrent festival of top-notch classical musicians, who give concerts at Lyra's home music hall, Chandler Center for the Arts; and who also work one-on-one with Lyra students in masterclasses open to the public.  Our incredible guest artists visit from such prestigious institutions as the NY Philharmonic, the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, the Pacifica Quartet, and the MN Orchestra, to name just a few.<br/></p>
<p>One of the hallmarks of Lyra is our incredibly low student:teacher ratio.  We have capped our enrollment at 5 students per teacher, so that everyone who attends receives a huge amount of individual attention and mentorship.  This is truly rare, indeed!  With such a close-knit group of students and staff, Lyra has been able to maintain a wonderful, nurturing environment that is supportive rather than competitive.  Our students learn not only their exceptional musical identities, but their personal ones as well.  </p>
<p>Many of our students come back year after year, and have often expressed how much they love and miss Lyra.  Some of our students have gone on to study at top music conservatories, while others make music a priority in their daily lives.  All of our students finish their final Lyra performance with a feeling of catharsis, accomplishment and renewal.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goals are to keep the high quality of our program, maintain our low student:teacher ratio, pay our faculty and artists fairly, and keep up with our expenses.  On top of that, we try to make Lyra possible to students from all economic backgrounds by giving scholarships to those with financial need.  <br/></p>
<p>But running a non-profit that values quality over quantity does not come easily.  Aside from the obvious expenses, like faculty fees and room &amp; board, we have facility fees, liability insurance, piano rentals &amp; moving, administrative fees, and transportation, amongst many other ongoing costs that add up quickly!  We appreciate the immense support from friends, family, and music-lovers that we have received in the past; and we hope that you will join them in giving to Lyra Music!</p>
<p>In the fall of 2014, we proudly received our 501(c)3 non-profit 
tax-exempt status, which means that anything you donate to us will 
entitle you to a tax-deduction to the full extent of the law. That in 
and of itself is a great incentive to donate! <br/></p>
<p>We also have many fun perks to choose from at all giving levels, including all-natural handmade lip balm created just for Lyra from Ondine&amp;Gaspard, CDs from our good friends at The Harlem String Quartet (some of whom have been Lyra Guest Artists), exclusive Lyra t-shirts, and more!  For donations at higher levels, we are offering a chance to sponsor a full scholarship for a student with financial need, sponsor a distinguished Lyra Guest Artist, or even underwrite the 2016 Lyra Music Youth Competition!  No matter at what level you are able to give, your donation will make a lasting impact on the future of Lyra.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>When you decide to donate, you can feel confident that your gift will go
 toward a worthy music education organization that supports not only the future of 
classical music, but also kids' self-esteem, confidence and discipline. 
 Lyra is a celebration of how classical music can bring us together, 
understand and learn from one another, and teach us to give of ourselves for each 
other.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Hawaii is a tropical paradise that draws travelers from
all over the world, thanks to its natural beauty and cultural richness. Yet the
extremely high cost of living, combined with the relatively low wages paid in a
tourism-based economy, conceals the struggles of its low-income communities.
All too often, Hawaii’s families struggle to provide their children with
quality nutrition, find affordable housing, and access health care.</p>
<p>Hawaii Appleseed receives generous support from its loyal donors, but we still critically need funding to finance our advocacy efforts to
improve the lives of Hawaii's residents in need. </p>
</div><div><ul></ul></div> <div> <h3>Our Goal and the Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>Hawaii Appleseed is seeking to raise $15,000 in order to continue our efforts to help families in Hawaii. </p>
<p>Much of the
work we do—namely impact litigation and legislative advocacy on behalf
of the poor—is rarely undertaken in Hawaii because of restrictions placed on organizations receiving governmental funding. Moreover, foundations will rarely support litigation or lobbying. </p>
<p>Hawaii Appleseed’s
freedom to use the most effective tools available to zealously advocate for
those in need comes at a price. Without traditional, stable sources of funding
for our work, we must rely heavily on donations from individuals and businesses who believe in the importance of our work. </p>
<p>Your
donations truly make a difference. Whatever amount you can give is magnified
many times over by Hawaii Appleseed. Operating on a shoestring budget in partnership with many other nonprofits in the community, we serve as a catalyst for improving the lives of low-income and
marginalized people in Hawaii. Hawaii Appleseed needs your support to continue
our important work toward breaking generational cycles of poverty by ensuring
that low-income families have access to safe and healthy homes, sufficient
food, good schools, and meaningful opportunities for self-achievement and
economic security.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>How We Help - Everyday</h3> <p></p>
<p>Here’s a sampling of some of our recent accomplishments:</p>
<p><b>Improving dangerous and unhealthy conditions in public housing </b></p>
<p><img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/759884/files/20140801123236-P1050233.JPG?1406921556"" src="""" style=""margin: 0px 10px; width: 330.354716981132px; height: 248px;""/>One of Hawaii Appleseed's recent cases resulted in the complete rehabilitation of the state's largest public housing project through the
leveraging of $150 million in federal tax credits. Residents of Kuhio Park Terrace had suffered from atrocious conditions for years—fire hazards, frequent sewage
backups, unsanitary trash disposal, vermin infestations, and chronically
failing elevators that left disabled residents confined to their units or stuck
for hours on the ground floor below. A similar case at the second largest project in the state is ongoing and has already resulted in significant repairs and upgrades.</p>
<p><b>Ensuring that children and families do not go hungry</b>  </p>
<p><img align=""left"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/801412/files/20140820144325-school_breakfast_2.jpg?1408571005"" src="""" style=""margin: 0px 20px; width: 284.558823529412px; height: 430px;""/>Hawaii Appleseed is partnering with schools to implement Breakfast in the Classroom, a proven model that gives low-income school children access to a healthy breakfast every school day. Countless studies have shown that eating breakfast supports academic achievement and improves
children’s health and well-being. <br/></p>
<p>Our advocacy has also helped ensure that families are able to access food stamps. Due to a backlog of applications, the State of Hawaii forced families to wait for months to get critically needed food assistance. Thanks to Hawaii Appleseed's work, families now receive their benefits in a timely manner, helping them avoid hunger.</p>
<p><b>Providing access to education for homeless students</b></p>
<p></p>

<p><b>Ensuring access to health care</b></p>
<p>Hawaii Appleseed prevented the state from cutting critical health care services such as dialysis and chemotherapy for thousands of Micronesian migrants legally residing in Hawaii. Our 2010 lawsuit initially halted these cuts, but the litigation continues. We need ongoing support to continue Hawaii Appleseed's efforts to maintain access to life-sustaining medical care. </p>

QUILTBAG attendees to dig into the meat of writing, creating, and
consuming QUILTBAG fiction, non-fiction, art, and media! It's a
wonderful opportunity to share and learn and grow in our artistic
endeavors while helping others around us to learn and grow in their

QUILTBAG? What the heck is QUILTBAG?


It's an awesome acronym to describe
what is historically called LGBT, but is so much more inclusive and
welcoming. QULTBAG stands for Queer/Questioning, Undecided,
Intersexed, Lesbian, Transsexual/Transgender, Bisexual, Asexual, and
Gay/Genderqueer. It's a large umbrella term that includes all sexual
and gender identifications, and it's the one we prefer to use.





Why Rainbow Conference?


We found that, within the QUILTBAG
artistic community, there was a severe lacking of this sort of
gathering. It was something we wanted to attend, but was never
offered by others. So, in the spirit of jumping head first into
shallow water, we founded the Rainbow Conference and hit the ground

This is a most unusual and innovative undertaking, involving young men from at-risk neighborhoods in an educational enterprise to build their confidence, leadership skills, community involvement and educational progress.</p>
<p>Ukwaluka: South Africa 2013 Project, in its maiden year, plans to take 10 African-American, African, Caribbean, and Latino students in their senior year of high school to South Africa for approximately two weeks, to engage them in educational, community-based activities and give them in-depth exposure to South African culture, diversity and institutions. The purpose of this, as outlined in the Proposal, is to uplift and empower these young men, in the absence of appropriate male role models, and help them to develop the inner resources to advance their education and become socially responsible leaders.  The following are objectives for this project, addressed in great detail in the proposal:</p>
<ul style=""margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 40px;"">

</li>
</ul>
<p class=""ColorfulList-Accent11CxSpLast"">Included in this curriculum is a three-day public service project in the townships, an overnight stay and private tour of Robben Island prison, including meetings with past political prisoners, a trip to the African bush, as well as a seminar about the HIV epidemic in South Africa with a leading clinician.</p>
<p>Funding for the travel and lodging portion of this trip is our greatest priority, as well as building an endowment that will allow this project to continue and expand. A contribution from you will give us the jumpstart we need while we continue to implement a recently developed series of fundraisers. We believe that this program can make a significant difference for young men who right now find themselves limited by their neighborhoods and income from moving out into the world and expanding their horizons and contributions.</p>
<p><b>Here are some examples of what your donation can do:</b></p>

This is a most unusual and innovative undertaking, involving young men from at-risk neighborhoods in an educational enterprise to build their confidence, leadership skills, community involvement and educational progress.
Ukwaluka: South Africa 2013 Project, in its maiden year, plans to take 10 African-American, African, Caribbean, and Latino students in their senior year of high school to South Africa for approximately two weeks, to engage them in educational, community-based activities and give them in-depth exposure to South African culture, diversity and institutions. The purpose of this, as outlined in the Proposal, is to uplift and empower these young men, in the absence of appropriate male role models, and help them to develop the inner resources to advance their education and become socially responsible leaders.  The following are objectives for this project, addressed in great detail in the proposal:


Create equity among students. 

Improve college readiness and employment marketability. 

Mentor students in becoming global citizens who contribute to all communities. 

Enhance school culture and build incentives for current and prospective students. 

Establish partnerships with South African organizations such as Afrika Tikkum and Robben Island for ongoing program/opportunity. 


Included in this curriculum is a three-day public service project in the townships, an overnight stay and private tour of Robben Island prison, including meetings with past political prisoners, a trip to the African bush, as well as a seminar about the HIV epidemic in South Africa with a leading clinician.
Funding for the travel and lodging portion of this trip is our greatest priority, as well as building an endowment that will allow this project to continue and expand. A contribution from you will give us the jumpstart we need while we continue to implement a recently developed series of fundraisers. We believe that this program can make a significant difference for young men who right now find themselves limited by their neighborhoods and income from moving out into the world and expanding their horizons and contributions.
Here are some examples of what your donation can do:
$ 4,000 will fund the entire trip for one student$ 2,000 will finance both the international and internal flight for one student.$ 1,500 will finance all lodging and activities for one student.$ 500 will finance all activities in Cape Town for one student$ 100 will finance an overnight stay on Robben Island, the prison where Nelson Mandela was jailed for 18 years and private tour by an ex political prisoner.$ 50 will pay for transportation to and from the townships where the students will spend four days engaged in social responsibility and leadership activities with young kids and students from poverty-stricken areas in South Africa.
We are close
to reaching our goal!  With the help of many wonderful individuals and a
major corporation, we need $7,000 more to make this powerful initiative a
reality.
We believe
that our program is consistent with your mission and vision and hope you will
support this program. If I can provide additional information to encourage
consideration of our request, please feel free to contact me at JBell6871@gmail.com or

<h2>About the Alan R. Pearlman Foundation &amp; ARPchives</h2>
<p>My name is Dina Pearlman.  I'm the daughter of the late Alan R. Pearlman, inventor of ARP Synthesizers - groundbreaking electronic synthesizers that changed the face of music forever.</p>
<h3>Why It's Important</h3>
<p>Since the death of my father in January 2019, I have seen overwhelming evidence that there needs to be a thoroughly reexamined history of his work because his story and that of ARP Synthesizers is relevant to the history and  understanding of modern music.</p>
<p>Even more importantly, because of the high cost of education and vintage electronic music instruments, <i>we want to offer opportunities for musicians, particularly</i> <strong><i>young and underfunded musicians</i></strong> to have educational <i>and </i>artistic opportunities - something that Alan was passionate about. </p>
<p>This is why the <a href=""https://alanrpearlmanfoundation.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Alan R. Pearlman Foundation</strong> </a>was formed - to honor his legacy as an inventor, a musician, an entrepreneur, an engineer and a mentor... <i><strong>to make his innovative inventions publicly accessible, and help inspire future generations to imagine and create through charitable projects.</strong></i></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>Before we can start our projects, we need to get the word out about our Foundation and our Mission. </p>
<p>Last January we were given an opportunity to introduce the Foundation to the music instrument industry at the hugely popular <a href=""https://www.namm.org/thenammshow/2020"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>NAMM (National Association of Music Merchants) show </strong></a> . You, the supporters of the Foundation helped us, the foundation board members to promote the Foundation, its mission and its charitable projects to electronic musicians, engineers, potential donors and the press. We had an extremely successful show and made hundreds of contacts as well as raise money and awareness for our projects.</p>
<h3>News and New Activities</h3>
<p>The Foundation is now a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization!</p>
<p>We received our status at the end of this past March! What a surprise in this year of unprecendented events.</p>
<p>Due to the worldwide pandemic, our major fundraising event was cancelled, and of course, like all of you, we did not attend the variety of trade shows that were originally scheduled for this year. </p>
<p>Like everyone, we have adjusted our original projects to adapt to the current climate. We persevered with live streams,  videos and a well-attended <strong>ARP 2500 Webinar </strong>with opening remarks by Jean-Michel Jarre!</p>
<p>We have an exciting 2021 planned for you.</p>
<p><strong>NEW PROGRAM! ARP Studio Living Collection: </strong>We are partnering with a non-profit recording studio to create a recording and creating ARP-centric studio environment. We have the space, and the beginning of a collection, and plan on launching next year.</p>
<p><strong>NEW LEARNING:</strong> We are working on an exciting, never-before seen series of instructional videos, that will be released on a pay-as-you-can subscription.</p>
<p><strong>Two New Webinars</strong> date TBA: <strong>The 2600</strong> and a summit with <strong>Women in Synthesis</strong></p>
<p><strong>2020 Achievements: </strong>We have been hosting a series of online educational opportunities and live stream 'studio visits' called ARPchives LIVE!<strong>50th Anniversary of ARP Synthesizers Celebration:</strong> This  included a series of recordings, live streams, commemorative artifacts and most exciting: an ARP 2500 ROUND-TABLE</p>

<h3>How You Can Make a Difference</h3>
<p>Though the Foundation is in its infancy, we are now a 501 (c)(3) not-for-profit. We are seeking funding to cover some of our costs to create online learning materials, purchase technology for our future online programs, marketing for the concert and scanning materials for the digital archives. </p>
<p>We need help from people like you! Music lovers, synth lovers, creators and believers in perpetuating educational and creative opportunities.</p>

A wonderful woman called me recently &amp; told me that she believes in me enough to be one of my biggest supporters for this trip! She told me that she knew I would be somebody who will make a difference in the life of many. She brought me to tears. She believes in me &amp; to me that means more than anything. She lent me $1200 for the rest of the airfare money I needed to make before the deadline. This woman would like to remain anonymous but out of everyone who could have helped me she was the last person I thought of.  Now I know this trip was meant to be. I have a contract with her to pay her back within 5 years but with help of my funders on here I hope to pay her back sooner. I am still in need to come up with at least $500 for the expenses I will have in Spain this summer.</p>
<p>Hi my name is Cecilia I'm a 26 year old single independent mom of a 7 year old son named Raul Jr. I am a proud single mom. I want to make this dream of mine to come true, I want to study abroad in Spain! Life is never easy &amp; we all have our own struggles in our own ways, my struggle is a bit different I have a disease called Crohn's Disease &amp; Ulcerative Colitis which both are debilitating at times. There is no cure for both disease. It's an auto immune system disease that affects the digestive tract. I like to live positive instead of negative even if I was given a life expectancy of age 45 years old.</p>
<p>I don't want my disabilities to stop me from living up to my potential. I want to be the best I can be! I was also recently diagnosed with Fibermyalgia which makes a lot of sense because I feel the crohnic pain everyday. I am a fight, please help me fight to live life to the fullest.My life consists of believing in myself &amp; being the best I can be. I love life &amp; I don’t take life for granite. I have made many mistakes &amp; don't regret anything in life for every step I have taken has brought me to be the woman I am today. I try to live positive instead of negative! I treat other how I want to be treated &amp; I am well mannered. I am confident in who I am &amp; in my personality! I hold myself well &amp; I am very professional when the time is needed to be.</p>
<p>I am a full time parent &amp; a full time college student so life stays busy. I am raising my child the only way I know how alone. I am 2nd youngest of 12 siblings first generation college student &amp; first generation in America. I am proud to be Mexican-American with the opportunities of going to college &amp; being the best I can be. I want to make a difference in this world not for fame but for change! I grew up around gangs &amp; violence which made me have the passion to go into Criminal Justice &amp; Law. I am currently working on my AA- transfer degree &amp; my International Studies Certificate in Spanish. I want to transfer to a 4 year university to obtain my Bachelor’s degree in Criminology, my Master of Public Administration &amp; my PhD in Public Affairs. I want to work in juvenile probation as a probation officer or correctional officer after I get my Bachelor’s degree. I also want to get my law degree in immigration law. </p>
<p>This campaign is important to me because I feel that this trip will benefit my career path in the future. Where is the best place to learn something? Spanish originated from Spain &amp; I want to learn Spanish in Spain! The money I raise with this fundraiser will go to my expenses I have in Spain for 3 weeks.</p>
<p>I know this world needs people like me to stand up and make a difference! Not everyone has determination like I do to be the best I can be in this life. I want to change the way our youth grow up into adults we are there destiny, what we teach them now will affect them forever. I believe I am someone who can make a difference in many lives but I need to be well rounded &amp; educated. I am currently working on that but I need to make my Spanish better &amp; to do so this trip will help me prepare my life for my second language.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you can't support me financially I ask if you can share my event with your family, friends, co-workers, neighbor's, colleagues and anyone who you think would be interested in hearing my story!</p></div>","UPDATE: I am officially going to Spain & I will be studying abroad summer 2013.

I like to live positive instead of negative even if I was given a life expectancy of age 45 years old.
I don't want my disabilities to stop me from living up to my potential. I want to be the best I can be! I was also recently diagnosed with Fibermyalgia which makes a lot of sense because I feel the crohnic pain everyday. I am a fight, please help me fight to live life to the fullest.My life consists of believing in myself & being the best I can be. I love life & I don’t take life for granite. I have made many mistakes & don't regret anything in life for every step I have taken has brought me to be the woman I am today. I try to live positive instead of negative! I treat other how I want to be treated & I am well mannered. I am confident in who I am & in my personality! I hold myself well & I am very professional when the time is needed to be.
I am a full time parent & a full time college student so life stays busy. I am raising my child the only way I know how alone. I am 2nd youngest of 12 siblings first generation college student & first generation in America. I am proud to be Mexican-American with the opportunities of going to college & being the best I can be. I want to make a difference in this world not for fame but for change! I grew up around gangs & violence which made me have the passion to go into Criminal Justice & Law. I am currently working on my AA- transfer degree & my International Studies Certificate in Spanish. I want to transfer to a 4 year university to obtain my Bachelor’s degree in Criminology, my Master of Public Administration & my PhD in Public Affairs. I want to work in juvenile probation as a probation officer or correctional officer after I get my Bachelor’s degree. I also want to get my law degree in immigration law. 
This campaign is important to me because I feel that this trip will benefit my career path in the future. Where is the best place to learn something? Spanish originated from Spain & I want to learn Spanish in Spain! The money I raise with this fundraiser will go to my expenses I have in Spain for 3 weeks.
I know this world needs people like me to stand up and make a difference! Not everyone has determination like I do to be the best I can be in this life. I want to change the way our youth grow up into adults we are there destiny, what we teach them now will affect them forever. I believe I am someone who can make a difference in many lives but I need to be well rounded & educated. I am currently working on that but I need to make my Spanish better & to do so this trip will help me prepare my life for my second language.
 
If you can't support me financially I ask if you can share my event with your family, friends, co-workers, neighbor's, colleagues and anyone who you think would be interested in hearing my story!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Hello! We're so glad that you have come to our donation page to learn more about our goal to provide vitamin gummies and coolers to the underprivileged families in the slums of Philippines. My friend Matthew Wai and myself, Kyle DeGuzman, are UCLA college students and have been given a unique opportunity to use our summer for a greater purpose: a medical missions trip. Besides the fact that we are not supported by a larger medical organization, what really sets us apart is our unique opportunity to build strong personal relationships with the patients we will be serving, as well as the doctors serving alongside us. Even more so, this gives us the chance to continue a relationship with our patients even after our work is done, allowing them to update us on their personal circumstances and daily struggles. Still, we are only two college students-so we truly need all the help we can get! We would wholeheartedly appreciate any amount of donation, small or large! Thank you for listening to our vision for this upcoming summer!</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>All money raised will be solely used to buy:</p>
<p>Vitamin gummies: Vitamin deficiency is the result of poor diet and malnourishment.</p>
<p>Coolers: Families do not have the resources to refreigerate which forces them to eat spoiled food. Providing coolers would prevent food poisoning and sickness.</p>
<p><strong>We hope you can help us make the most out of this trip by supporting us through donations!</strong></p>

<p>What would you do if your child was transgender? Because you're looking at a transgender video project on Indiegogo, I'll assume it would probably be okay with you. You'd love him unconditionally and do your very best to help that child grow up to reach his highest potential.</p>
<p>Unfortunately that's not the norm. Many thousands of parents in America will part ways with their child when they discover that their child is transgender. If the child is too young yet to be abandoned, they mistreat and bully him into conforming unnaturally to the role of his outward gender. And this ultimately leads to years of frustration, confusion, pain and hopelessness for the transgender child.</p>
<p>What these parents don't understand is that being transgender is not ""choosing to be a weirdo,"" as one parent put it, but a natural, biological occurrence - the phenomenon of a girl's brain, heart, and emotions born prisoner in a boy's body, or vice versa. But in America, especially rural America, and in many churches, transgender young people are literally demonized, run out of town, and in many cases, murdered or driven to commit suicide.</p>
<p>The lack of familial and communal acceptance is why 40% of transgender people don't make it to age 30. Transgender people are probably the most misunderstood and wrongly persecuted section of humanity in America.</p>
<p>The root of the problem is simple. It's misunderstanding. And what people don't understand, they fear, hate, shun and condemn.</p>
<p>My film Transgendervention will prevent parents from rejecting and ejecting their transgender children by bridging these gaps in understanding with upfront and in-depth medical, biological, and psychological information from doctors, scientists and therapists who specialize in the study and treatment of transgender people. This documentary will provide vital and current information especially for transgender youth and their families in the hopes that by illuminating and educating them, families will not turn their backs on their transgender children, but continue to love and support them, and have enough knowledge to be able to spread understanding, themselves.</p>
<p>Many transgender adolescents who may be in the position of ""coming out"" have a narrow and extremely critical window of opportunity to either win the understanding and acceptance of their families or lose those relationships forever. It is my goal, my mission, to provide a film that will explain to these parents what their child is experiencing and why and how these kids can grow up to lead happy and productive lives within a loving and supportive family, and not out on the street. It will be a way they can come out without getting kicked out.</p>
<p>Through interviews with doctors and experts, I will present the biological and physiological reasons why a transgender child may feel that they are ""in the wrong body"" and unable to conform to gender norms. I will present the importance and benefits of aiding transgender kids in their transition at an earlier age so that they can be who they are, and not have to suppress their self-identities throughout their young lives. My interviews will also provide ample, sound advice on bullying, social situations, personal safety considerations, religious opposition and transgender-specific legal issues.</p>
<p>Finally we will demonstrate that there has always been this ""third sex"" of people and briefly give some examples of societal acceptance and admiration of transgender people in other cultures.</p>
<p>This documentary will be a one-stop, best bet source of education for families starting on the path of transition, and will provide them with the resources, knowledge, and reassurance to continue loving and caring for their child.</p>
<p>It is my sincerest hope that this documentary will reach any misguided families of transgender children before they throw their children out of their homes like so many before them, and be a source of light and guidance for others who may have little or no access to the resources and information presented in this film.</p>
<p>Before its release, I will test this film on numerous conservative, uptight, backwards, prejudiced audiences to see if it can bridge the gap in their understanding of trans people as these will be its target demographics and the type of audiences on which it most needs to reach.</p>
<p>This is a monumentally important project. I just need your financial support to make it happen! </p>
<p>Your money will go to fund travel expenses for my interviews of doctors, therapists, and experts in the field of gender dysphoria, and interviews of model families of transgender children. Your money will pay for production, equipment rental, studio time, editing, post-production, music scoring, and distribution costs. I also need funds to enter this documentary in film festivals, not necessarily to win them, but to let people know it is available to them.</p>
<p>The more funds I can raise, the better this film will be. So please, donate.</p>
<p>Additionally, Josh Lehrer, the amazing photographer who did the project ""Becoming Visible: Portraits of Homeless Transgender Teens"" has agreed to let me to use some of his beautiful and heart-rending photographs taken on the streets of NYC in presenting the statistics on transgender homelessness and mortality. Thank you, Josh!</p>
<p>Please support this project right now! Together, we can make a huge difference in the lives of transgender children.</p>

<h3>About us</h3>
<p>Muslim Association of Lehigh Valley is guided by a vision to preserve and perpetuate the Islamic heritage and uphold ethical and intellectual standards. The pursuit of this vision and gradual growth are among the main factors that have transformed our community from a small nucleus to over 500+ families.</p>
<p>The Muslim Association of the Lehigh Valley (MALV) was established in the early 1980s.  Our first home was a 1,500 square foot building in Emmaus, PA that provided worship space for about 100 community members. By 1990, we had outgrown this space and decided to build a new masjid in Whitehall, PA; a busy suburb located at the center of the Lehigh Valley region. Through the generous donations of the Islamic community and by the grace of Allah (SWT), we were able to construct our current home, a beautiful 14,000 square foot structure on over seven acres of land. Facilities include a prayer hall, full-time and weekend school, Islamic library, social hall, kitchen, and playground. We have a current membership of about 250 families and an average attendance of over 500 for Juma prayer. On Eid, we usually have close to 1,500 brothers and sisters offering their prayers at our masjid.</p>
<h2>The Need</h2>
<p>We have been blessed with tremendous growth in the past 5 years, thanks to Allah (SWT) and are committed to establishing Pennsylvania's finest islamic school and expanding our community center, so our children can develop into exemplary Muslim Americans. The completion of school expansion and community center project will provide an Islamic environment in which our children may flourish into healthy, intelligent, and valuable American citizens. </p>
<h2>The Project</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>The project is designed to be built in multiple phases and would provide facilities for additional classrooms and community center. The project would add 20,800 square feet of classroom space on two levels, next to the current school building, and would add a 8,200 square feet community center which will include a gymnasium, full-size basketball court, game/exercise room, school cafeteria, commercial kitchen and also serve as a multipurpose social hall for all community events.</p>
<ul>
<li>20,800 sq. ft. of school building &amp; 8,200 sq. ft. of community center</li>
<li>20 new classrooms with sizes varying from 475 sq. ft. to 550 sq. ft.</li>
<li>An art room, technology lab, science lab, nurses office, administrative</li>
<li>&amp; principal’s office</li>
<li>A 845 sq. ft. library and game room in community center</li>
</ul>
<p>The cost of the complete project is estimated to be $3.8 Million, we've till date raised about $1 Million from local community and now we need to reach out.  We had a groundbreaking ceremony on August 11th 2012 by Imam Sirraj Wahhaj and Ustadh Khalil Moore and our immediate goal is to raise $100,000 from outside our community to supplement our local efforts.</p>
<p><span>While our ambitions are lofty, we also recognize our inability to do this without help.  We first ask Allah to support us in this endeavor and ask you to help us in our hour of need.  Without this expansion, our students will have no recourse but to attend public school after fourth grade.  Every contribution, great or small, will have a share in the reward from the benefits offered from this institution.</span></p>
<p><span>The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: ' Whoever starts a good thing and is followed by others, will have his own reward and a reward equal to that of those who follow him, without it detracting from their reward in any way'.  Furthermore, Allah has also guaranteed a reward for those who sincerely give for His cause. ""Those who spend their possessions (for the sake of God) by night and by day, secretly and openly, shall have their reward with their Sustainer; and no fear need they have, and neither shall they grieve.""  (2:274)</span></p>
<h2>How can you help us</h2>
<p>You can help us realize our dream to have islamic school and community center.  </p>
<ul>
<li><span>Contribute financially. No amount is too small in the sight of Allah.</span></li>
<li><span>Sponsor a classroom or laboratory in the name of an individual.</span></li>
<li><span>Give a Qarz-e-Hasan (Interest-free loan) to be repaid within 5-10 years.</span></li>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Who I Am</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is Erik Farrell, and I have a passion for fine art, history, and the preservation thereof. Beginning in October of 2012, I will be attending Durham University in England working towards a Master’s degree in Conservation of Archaeological and Museum Objects.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Archaeological and artifact conservation is a demanding field which requires skills in archaeology, history, fine arts, and chemistry all rolled together in a single, integrated package.  I have been admitted to a Global Top-100 university whose Archaeology program was ranked number 1 in the 2010 Times Guide, and I have the background to be successful. I have Summa Cum Laude BAs in Archaeology and Anthropology, have studied Organic and Inorganic chemistry at the university level, and have over a decade of experience working with fine art ceramics.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why Conservation is Important</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Every day we hear about the declining yield of natural resources, speculation of just how long before fossil fuels run out. There is, however, another decline, one which – like oil – cannot be rescued once destroyed. Our collective material-cultural heritage is decaying. Three times since 2010, a building or wall has collapsed in Pompeii, one of the world’s most famous archaeological sites. The Taj Mahal’s shimmering white marble is slowly yellowing from exposure to air pollution. Hundreds of thousands of artefacts from all over the world and all periods in time are improperly stored, have been poorly conserved in centuries past, or have never been consolidated to begin with, and these artefacts are decaying. There are not enough conservators to properly preserve the collective heritage of humanity, and I would like to help rectify that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What I am Asking For, and What You Get</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am asking for assistance with expenses in my studies. I have received grants and loans which, along with my own savings and assistance from family members, will pay a great deal of my costs. Conservation, however, is an expensive career to pursue; I am still seeking funds to put towards transportation costs, lab fees and materials, and housing costs during required internship periods. Because of the rather intangible nature of what I am seeking assistance for, I am falling back on my ceramics background as a means of thanking donors.  Anyone who donates $50 will receive a coffee mug (pictured at<a href=""http://imgur.com/weheQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://imgur.com/weheQ</a> ). Donors giving $200 or more will receive a sgraffito decorated plate (<a href=""http://imgur.com/9NdtT"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://imgur.com/9NdtT</a> or <a href=""http://imgur.com/IDzeE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://imgur.com/IDzeE</a> ), signed and numbered from a limited edition run, the design of which I will retire.  The first donor to give $750 will receive a large sgraffito plate (<a href=""http://imgur.com/lyb2X"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://imgur.com/lyb2X</a> ). All items which I am offering in thanks to donors are handmade and decorated by me. All pieces carry my personal stamp (used only on limited runs, gallery works, and items for my own personal use), and the plates are all individually signed as well.</p>

<p><strong>Other Ways to Assist</strong></p>

<p>As someone of limited means I know that not everyone can help financially, even with causes that they find merit in. Please, if you cannot afford to donate, spread the word; let your friends, family, and coworkers know.

<h3>Who is Frank?</h3>
</div>
<div>Frank is the perfect example of what happens when you take a chance on a kid. At 10 years old he was on the streets in Moshi, trying to find a way to better his life. By getting involved with a street kids center, he was able to get an education and a place to stay. One of the volunteers saw something in Frank and sponsored him to go to university where he got a degree in Tourism and Travel.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And he came back. He didn't go off to a better, more prosperous city. He came back to Moshi to give back to the community. His dream is to start a preliminary school for orphaned children and those living in poverty. We have secured the location and have started work on it, but in the meantime, Frank has no income. Every penny raised so far has gone back into the school.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I was lucky enough to meet Frank when I went to Tanzania on a volunteer trip. At the time, he was the ""team leader"" at the volunteer house which basically means babysitter to us volunteers who had no knowledge of the language, very little of the culture, and were used to things like hot water and consistent power. :) He was great and made sure we were taken care of. I've been in contact with Frank since I left and we have teamed up to get this school going. We will need about $50k and the doors will open in January! But until we have enough donations to pay staff, he's staying with friends and living on pennies. <strong>He's a very private man and would be terribly embarrassed <strong>and humbled</strong> that I set this fundraiser up- but if we are to get the school started, Frank needs to be able to survive while he's coordinating efforts.</strong>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>The minimum Frank needs to pay bills and eat would be <strong>$400/month for 6 months.</strong> That's where the goal of $2400 comes in. That is nothing to most of us, but to Frank, this will mean the difference of being able to focus on his dream full time or part time. If that goal is surpassed, we will not only increase Frank's wages to $500/month but anything over that will go to the school fund!  Painting, maintenance on the building, chairs, tables, toys, supplies.... you will have a hand in getting the school started!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
There is no free education in Tanzania. There are over 2 million orphans in Tanzania due to AIDS or malaria with 58% of the population living on less than $1/day. What will happen to them if they do not get a chance at a better life?  Many of Frank's peers who have the same story of poverty never made it to adulthood. <strong>Because someone took a chance on Frank, he will start a school that will help hundreds and hundreds of children living in poverty.  </strong>The school will impact the lives of 400 children living in poverty over 5 years as well as offer education on child development and advocacy to parents.<strong> Helping one man can change the lives of many. </strong>

<p>Wolf PAC’s primary aim with <strong>The Butterfly Project </strong>is to offer this universal message of hope and survival as a service to the community. The project includes the performance of Celeste Raspanti's play <em>I Never Saw Another Butterfly </em>by Wolf PAC’s young actors, talk-backs between cast members and audiences, post-show discussion with survivors and liberators, and the opportunity to create one of 15,000 hand-crafted butterflies being collected throughout the duration of the project.  Each butterfly will honor the memory of one child who passed through Terezin. The touring performances will be available FREE OF CHARGE. </p>

<p><strong>The Butterfly Project </strong>launched with a special premiere production in Philadelphia on April 19<sup>th</sup> at the National Museum of American Jewish History on Holocaust Remembrance Day 2012, followed by four additional performances which were offered free of charge at NMAJH. These inaugural performances alone already reached over 1000 people. Wolf PAC reached the fundraising goal needed to launch this project by tapping into Wolf PAC board members, parents, and local supporters.  It is time to reach out to a broader community in order to reach an overall fundraising goal that is almost 3-times the funds needed for the premiere.  Success through IndieGoGo will make a significant dent in this major fundraising effort.  We exceeded our initial fundraising goals to premiere the project, and we know we can at least meet our next goal, especially with a successful IndieGoGo campaign.</p>

Hi All! As some of you know and others not, I am a member of a group of young innovators called Sandbox. Sandbox looks to bring together the best and brightest innovators under 30 years old to solve the worlds problems and create a family that supports and educates each other. This year, Sandbox is bringing together our community for a 3 day Summit in Lisbon, Portugal full of classes, speakers, working sessions, and problem solving.

The Impact
This is a really big opportunity for me. 

Sandbox started in 2008 and is now the foremost global community of extraordinary young achievers below 30. It brings together young people worldwide that already have an impressive impact at a very young age, no matter in what field or industry. The growing community counts 600 young leaders in 48 different countries. Over the past 2 years, Sandbox has organized over 300 local and regional events in more than 18 cities in the US, in Europe, in Africa and in Asia. For the first time now, Sandbox is organizing an event that will bring together its members on a global scale in one physical location â€“ the Sandbox Global Summit. On January 20-22, 2012, Sandboxers from all over the world will come together in Lisbon, Portugal and turn the city into the melting pot of the most innovative thinking, fresh ideas, and the full passion and energy of Generation Y. Imagine the possibilities. Key issues faced by Sandboxers and the world will be questioned, analyzed, and brainstormed, and solutions will be put into action. Lifetime friendships will be forged. The Summit will have a concrete outcome as well: the Sandbox Playbook. Sandboxers may come from very different backgrounds and be engaged in different fields, but they have one thing in common: they donâ€™t play by the rules, but rather try to change them. Some of them have already done so, others have a vision of how to make it happen. In Lisbon and on giant paper, the rules that Sandboxers live and act by, the rules that change the game, will be captured. With so many young changemakers finally coming together in one place, it is a critical moment to bring these rules forward and capture them for others to share as well. The final creation will be edited into a hardcopy that will live beyond the event so that other leaders and multipliers can also benefit and apply the rules to generate new ideas, propel their ventures forward and drive impact on a global scale.


What We Need & What You Get
As you may guessed, flights to Lisbon are not cheap and the EURO IS A PAIN IN THE BUTT. CHECK OUT MY BUDGET BELOW:

$700: Flight to Lisbon
$500: Summit Ticket
$200: Accommodations while there
$100: Ground Travel

<h3>The Impact</h3>
In the short term, we will show students and their families that we care, provide them with hope, and offer part-time job opportunities for students. In the long term, we will help reduce high school drop out rates, crime rates, strengthen the economy, and lessen the need for expensive social programs. Hence, more government monies can be redirected to stimulating the economy in terms of job creation via the development of infrastructures, new technologies, and related industries.</div>

</div></div>","Our Story

For the last nine years,  the London Teenage Poetry SLAM project has provided an annual exchange program for deserving and underprivileged young poets.  Chicagoan poets, educators and students opened their arms to those London poets, and over seven days of workshops, visits to local schools, performances and late-night conversations, we've built an international poetry community.  The week is often seen as life changing. 

One British poet described the exchange in Chicago: ""That week I experienced how powerful poetry is; how it can bring all kinds of people together in the most unexpected places. I went out a new and nervous writer, and came back a poet.""
 
This year, for the Olympic year and 10th year of this powerful collaborative experience,  we want to make it happen again with a twist by having the Chicago area poets go London. Weâ€™re aiming to send four young poets ages 18-24 and one chaperone across the Atlantic for a week of writing, learning, teaching and international exchange.
 
Volunteers will be donating their time to make this happen, and poets and teachers will be welcoming us in their homes to keep costs to a minimum. However, to ensure the trip happens, we need to cover the cost of the airfare.  


The Poets
The poets were selected from the applications from a highly competitive pool of Oak Park and River Forest alumnus. All of the poets participated in the Spoken Word club, led by Peter Kahn, during their tenure at OPRFHS.  They also were members of the elite Slam Team, which competes in the world's largest youth poetry slam, Louder than a Bomb. Meet them here:


Novana Venerable is a senior at Smith College graduating in May of 2012 with a degree in Psychology and in Spanish Language and Literature. She was able to compete in the national poetry competition, Brave New Voices, her sophomore year in high school and has since been featured in the documentary Louder Than A Bomb. As a subject of the film, Novana has traveled to a wide variety of cities, including Toronto and Palm Springs, to teach writing workshops to high school children in hopes of starting new poetry clubs and slam competitions. Novana has inspired many youth to write and perform poetry and is hoping to be able to coach a Spoken Word Club of her own after college.

Tabitha Watson is a senior at Boston University who will be graduating in May with a Bachelor of Science in Journalism, and a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science with a minor in Spanish. She was a Gwendolyn Brooks Poetry Competition finalist and has recently been published in the Boston Globe.


Asia Calcagno is attending Connecticut College on a full-tuition leadership scholarship from the Posse Foundation. She is currently a sophomore majoring in English with a concentration in creative writing and is receiving her certification in secondary education. Asia was a dedicated member of her high schoolâ€™s spoken word club for three years and was extremely excited to continue her performing and writing in college. She is currently the Vice President of a thriving and popular spoken word/poetry club on her college campus where she runs writing and performance workshops weekly. Asia has competed in Brave New Voices poetry festival as a member of the Illinois All Star team. Along with a close friend on campus, Asia has recently started an after school spoken word/poetry club at the Science and Technology Magnet School in New London, CT to provide a writing community for the high school students.

Kyndall Jones, currently a senior at Oak Park River Forest High School has performed in seven showcases appearing before crowds in excess of 350 people. She has been a captain of her performance group for six showcases.  She has performed for her entire school of nearly 3,200 during the annual Martin Luther King assembly. This year she is a part Oak Parkâ€™s Louder Than A Bomb Slam Team (The largest youth poetry slam in the country). Kyndall has helped lead poetry workshops at The University of Illinois-Chicago in 2011 and 2012. She also helped lead a workshop at Urban Prep High School in Chicago. Kyndall Jones has participated in writing workshops lead by Terrance Hayes (National Book Awards Winner), Roger Bonair-Agard (National Poetry Slam Champion) and Marty McConnell (Def Poetry Jam). 

Ms. Jessica Stovall is an English and Reading teacher at Oak Park and River Forest High School. She has hosted London Teenage Poetry slam poets and their poet coaches for the last five years, and has attended almost every OPRF Spoken Word showcase and Louder than a Bomb competition since she moved to Chicago in 2007.  She has also been a judge for the National Spoken Word competition, Brave New Voices.  Although an amateur poet herself, she is inspired by the deep impact the spoken word has had on herself and her beloveds.  After finishing her graduate thesis at Northwestern University early this summer, she feels that this opportunity will be a hug to her soul.





The Impact

Nova says, â€œI am excited to be able to work in a new location. Culture has a big influence in the way people write. Style, content, sentiment and importance are framed by the way a nation functions. I am interested in writing from the view point of others and shaping a story from a perspective that may not always be heard or listened to. The opportunity to go to another country, to learn another culture and to gain a point of view that is different from the one Americans seem to find themselves stuck without change will give me a new idea of how writing can connect people from all different backgrounds and how to incorporate another culture and these foreign experiences into my own perspective in order to life a better quality life.â€

Tabitha says, â€œIâ€™m a traveler. I love to meet new people and experience new cultures. This love helps me to not only grow as a person, but also as a writer. It gives me new perspectives to write from, and insight into stories that I have never heard before. Traveling challenges and stretches me outside of my boundaries. It makes me uncomfortable, and yet a stronger person. This trip to London will allow me to go to a different place and meet others who, like myself, are travelers. Iâ€™m just excited to write memories on napkins or etch stories on my hand so that I could remember the experience forever. I want to write in a place where my story will be too inspired to become bland.â€


Asia says, ""My inspiration as a writer is culture, but what inspires me to write are differences. I have never been outside of the country, and by exposing myself to an atmosphere different than what I am familiar with, I am sure that my writing will grow far outside of its comfort zone.

My goal is to keep the event free to the public by fundraising enough moola to pay for all the event logistics (including but not limited to: marketing and advertising, production and media, hiring for DJ, MC, event crew, canopies/chairs/tables, supplies &amp; equipment, etc.). <br/><br/>This year my goal is to give stipends to ALL creative talent who step forward and showcase their creativity, most of whom volunteer their gifts to the show. This aspect is going to depend entirely on the amount of funds raised. The more funds raised, the higher the stipend amounts. I really want to demonstrate the value of our creative artists by paying all who participate, even if they are enthusiastic about volunteering. <div>

</div></div>","Hafa adai from Creative Indeed on the beautiful island of Guam! My name is Michelle Pier, and I am the organizer of the annual Luna Festival, through my business Creative Indeed. I am an artist with a passion for ALL the creative arts (and sciences) on Guam, striving to promote the value and sustainability of our local talent, organizations and small business entrepreneurs as much as possible. The Luna Festival was inspired by this passion. The Luna Festival is a creative arts celebration with a Guam style woven into the festivities. My goal is to keep the event free to the public by fundraising enough moola to pay for all the event logistics (including but not limited to: marketing and advertising, production and media, hiring for DJ, MC, event crew, canopies/chairs/tables, supplies & equipment, etc.). This year my goal is to give stipends to ALL creative talent who step forward and showcase their creativity, most of whom volunteer their gifts to the show. This aspect is going to depend entirely on the amount of funds raised. The more funds raised, the higher the stipend amounts. I really want to demonstrate the value of our creative artists by paying all who participate, even if they are enthusiastic about volunteering. 

This fundraising effort is specifically to be able to give stipends to all participating creative talent at the Luna Festival. $2000 will be able to pay 5-10 talent showcases a creative stipend between $50-$200 (depending whether individual or group). YOUR support, even in the smallest amount, will make a HUGE difference in the overall outcome of this important event for Guam. Si Yu'us ma'ase for all support you've shown for the Luna Festival! Have an amazing day! THANK YOU!Official LUNA FESTIVAL event page: http://creativeindeed.net/events/annual-luna-festival-of-creative-arts/

</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Three months ago, I quit my job and moved to Argentina with my boyfriend, Jimi. It was scary and exhilarating; I had no idea what to expect. My boyfriend's parents lived in the city of Tucumán and we planned to use their home as ""home base"" for our travels. Initially, Tucumán was little more than a free place to stay and some delicious homemade meals. <br/></p>
<p>But then something changed all that. Marlene, Jimi's mom, started a program seven years ago called ""Children at Risk"" (or ""Centro Integral de Ayuda A La Familia y Los Niños"") that works with children in a really poor part of the city. One Tuesday evening, she invited me to come along with her to help. After spending an hour crossing the city by bus, we arrived at a local church facility and I helped the other volunteers set up tables and prepare snacks. <br/></p>
<p>At 6 o'clock a van pulled up and the kids flooded out. Dozens of children raced towards us, hugging the volunteers. Some even came up and politely kissed me on the cheek. The next two hours flew by as we played with the kids and helped them with their homework. I was surprised by how far I could stretch my elementary Spanish when it came to basic math and spelling! <br/></p>
<p>For three months, I have had the pleasure of returning time and again to help with these children. They have completely captured my heart with their smiles and hugs. The stories I hear about their living conditions at home feel like punches in the stomach. Many don't have running water or roofs on their houses. One girl recently suffered a broken arm at the hand of her mother. Several of the older boys have dropped out of school. These kids fall through the cracks in the system in Argentina, where the government does a lot for children who are orphaned or disabled, but very little for those who have parents (regardless of the level of poverty, abuse, or addiction). <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>A New Hope<br/>
</h3>The church that hosts ""Children at Risk"" recently donated a plot of land and some money to begin building a facility for the kids. It is a huge blessing, as Marlene has been working with these families for nearly a decade. She quickly brought in a construction crew and was able to build a classroom in less than two months. <br/><br/>It is amazing for the kids to finally have a space of their own. Unfortunately, the nearest bathrooms are in the main church building-- a good city block away. They also do not have access to a kitchen, which limits the type of snacks they can provide for the kids. Marlene hopes to raise enough money to begin the process of expanding the room and providing more facilities.<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Where You Come In<br/>
</h3> <p>We are hoping to raise $5,000 in order to construct bathroom and kitchen facilities. All donations to this campaign will go directly towards that building project. Any excess funds will be used towards other expansions and amenities, including books, tables, and chairs. <br/></p>We want you to know how important your donation is to these kids. If you donate $25 or more, we will send you a handwritten thank-you note from one of the children. You are making a huge difference by providing them with a safe place to learn and grow. The more time they are able to spend in this facility, the less time they are spending on the streets. <br/><br/>This is a really unique way to spread joy around the world during this holiday season. Please, spread the word about Children at Risk!<br/><br/><br/>

For a year starting September 1, 2014, I'm launching a funding campaign every 40 days. Nine organizations that mean something to me personally will benefit
MissionThe 40 Project is a charitable organization that creates and promotes fundraising campaigns for the time span between September 1, 2014 and September 1, 2015. Nine organizations with intrinsic personal connection to Jason Robert LeClair will benefit from this venture.Description
On September 1, 2014, I am launching the first of 9 fundraising campaigns. Why the 40 project? I am turning 40 on September 1. For that year I want to give back. Every 40 days of my 40th year, I will be trying to raise at least $1,000 funds for nine causes that mean something to me. 
The nine fundraisers will be run through Indiegogo. All funds will be paid directly to the organizations. The organizations are as follows:
9/1/14 - 10/10/14 - Rhode Island Stage Ensemble10/11/14 - 11/19/14 - Walk for Life11/20/14 - 12/29/14 - Beacon Charter High School for the Arts12/30/14 - 2/7/15 - Educational Theatre Association2/8/15 - 3/19/15 - National Art Educators Foundation3/20/15 - 4/28/15 - Polycystic Kidney Disease Foundation4/29/15 - 6/8/15 - ASPCA6/9/15 - 7/19/15 - The Haitian Project7/20/15 - 8/29/15 - St. Thomas Food PantryThank you for your support of these amazing organizations trying to better our world in so many ways!",1.0,0,"11 Campaigns

<h3>A Computer For An Indigenous Police Force In Mexico<br/>
</h3>
<p>Dear Everyone,<br/><br/>
I am writing to ask for help in procuring a laptop computer for the organizers of a very important social movement in
 Mexico.<br/><br/>
Last Fall I worked with and wrote about a fascinating organization in 
Guerrero, Mexico, called La Policia Comunitaria. They are an indigenous,
 autonomous police force and justice system that arose out of an utter 
absence of any sort of state-sponsored security. They base themselves on
 indigenous ideas of law and justice, and they try to, instead of 
ostracizing people who are convicted of a crime, involve them in 
community service and ""re-education.""<br/><br/>
Their system is not perfect, but it is an important movement and a 
beacon of inspiration in a region of Mexico that is riven with violence.
 Indeed, in the areas of La Policia Comunitaria's influence, there is 
almost no crime anymore, especially compared with the surrounding locales.<br/><br/>
You can read more about them here, in an article I wrote:<br/><br/><a href=""http://upsidedownworld.org/main/mexico-archives-79/2855-where-the-people-order-and-the-law-obeys-the-policia-comunitaria-in-guerrero-mexico"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://upsidedownworld.org/main/mexico-archives...</a><br/><br/>

asked if I could help them by procuring a laptop computer, one that they
 could use when they travel between the different towns in the region of

only that it can run a word-processing program and access the internet 
with a wireless connection. I am looking to raise funds here to 
buy a machine for them which I or another person will hand deliver to Cirino. <br/><br/>

My name is Deva Watson and I am the founding and lead art teacher at at a charter school in the Philadelphia area. I went to the High School for Creative and Performing Arts, received my BA in film from Temple University, and my MAT in art education from University of The Arts. I recently just finished my AmeriCorps year of service where I served as a learning support co-teacher and art enrichment teacher. Throughout finishing my master's degree and AmeriCorps service, I have worked at <a href=""http://thepubandkitchen.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pub and Kitchen</a>/<a href=""http://thedivinghorseavalon.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Diving Horse</a>, with full support from GM Ed Hackett and Chef Johnathan Adams, as a server working 80 hour work weeks, in order to pay for art supplies for my students. I am from Northeast Philadelphia and currently living in Fishtown with my three roommates (all working artists) and my dog, Lenin. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Education wasn't the field I envisioned myself being in. It became important over a period of time when I was freelancing as a film editor. I kept hearing how schools were cutting art programs in Philadelphia public schools, yet suburban schools were maintaining theirs for the most part. I wasn't happy editing reality tv, so I decided to got back to school and get my master's in education. I remember loving my teachers at CAPA because I got to do art 4 periods a day, learned editing foundational work, and even won a UPenn prize for a short film that I made there. At UArts, I honed my craft of creating lesson plans, classroom management, etc. I, unlike my peers, wanted to create lessons that were in depth, thought provoking, and not making art for art sake. While student teaching, I got 75 broken skate decks from Bustin longboards in NY for my 8th graders and did a graffiti art project based on working artists Banksy and Shepard Fairey. At my high school student teaching placement, I had my students create lino cuts/ prints based on areas of conflict. Students had to research Palestine, Holocaust, etc, create prints that represented those areas of struggle, and comment on those places/history in artist statements. I wanted students through the art classroom to become global citizens and begin to understand its complexities. You will see this work through all the videos and images I posted.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div>Currently, my school and principal are trying to make something really amazing for my future students. We deceided to seek a modern, sustainable design company that would build an art classroom pro-bono. <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/GreensawDesignBuild"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Greensaw</a> loved the project and came on board. We have taken measurements, had various design meetings, and finally finalized on our design plan to the school's leadership board.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Update:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Phase I:</div>
<div>The school itself was suppose to make an initial investment into building the art classroom. We just got word we lost money from state funding, meaning the school can not put up the initial $6,000 needed to get this project off the ground to secure shop time, pay the Greensaw team for doing the shop work (building cabinents, etc) because they would have to put larger paying projects on hold, and initial supplies. Therefore, all money will go into generated would contribute to initial funds not met because of losing state funding.</div>

<h2>What we are doing...</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Our organization brings together a large network of educators, financial professionals and curriculum providers to find the most efficient and cost effective way to reach students who are in need of financial literacy education. Our latest initiative is the youth basketball camp that we hope to implement. We have a head instructor who is on the coaching staff of a prominent Los Angeles college team. He brings with him connections to well-known college players and a few corporate sponsors. We hope that the opportunity to learn basketball skills with experienced coaches will draw students to join the camp while learning important life lessons that will protect them in the financial world. The camp will be held for 2 days in July for 6 hours each day. The students will have alot of fun and the coaches will keep them engaged with basketball training, guest speakers and literacy lessons. A rewards ceremony will also take place at the end of the camp.</p>
<h2>Why You Should Support Us...</h2>
<p>Our organization bring financial literacy curriculum to low-income communities where schools are not informed about the many different financial literacy materials that are available to them. We are always finding new ways to reach students so that they can be equipped with the basic lessons about the financial world. After the economic downtrend that started in 2008, financial literacy has come to the forefront of educational reform, but many states do not mandate this kind of curriculum, therefore it us up individuals and organizations that are passionate about the issue to continue advocating literacy. Our group of 6 is a passionate bunch, and when we set our minds to something we get the job done! We believe our work is imperative and our basketball camp proposal is the first of its kind that specifically serves this purpose. Hopefully this camp will be the first of many to come!</p>
<h2>Our Impact Is...</h2>
<p>We want to see a world where young students are given an equal opportunity to be financially sufficient and healthy. We believe that all youth, without regard to their economic background, should understand how to protect themselves in the business world that they will soon face. Financial literacy is a great way to provide these students with the basics to protecting themselves while creating a strong future population of capable and knowledgeable citizens.</p></div>","What we are doing...

<p><strong><br/></strong></p></div>","Friends , Family, Colleagues:

As a result of my audition for Harvard University's American Repertory Theater MFA program, I was invited back for the summer intensive they run in collaboration with the Moscow Art Theater School.Both of these are world renowned schools and the excitement I feel to have such an opportunity to study with amazing teachers and continue to develop my craft is immeasurable. 

With your $20 ( tax deductible) donation you will help me achieve a huge step forward in my career as an actor and my goal to become a  teaching artist. 

Your donation will go only towards paying the remaining balance of my tuition. 

Please consider helping this dreamer out ! I will thank you for the rest of my days. Where ever my career takes me I will remember and thank those who helped me.

<p> </p></div>","Who We Are
 

Hack the Future is a recurring full-day event which helps inspire kids in the field of science and technology by providing a practical hands-on open-ended creative experience under the supervision of domain experts.  

 

Kids between the ages of 8 to 18 discover that it is possible for them to create things such as games, websites, and robots by creating these things live at the event. There is no set curriculum, only resources and challenges set before the kids. The kids are motivated by their own internal creativity and passions, and the results have absolutely blown us away.

 

 
 
Hack the Future creates a space for kids to bring their curiosity and dedication and be mentored by Silicon Valley engineers.  The patient and passionate environment of Hack the Future inspires these kids to take on challenges that even adults (sometimes even the ones there!) struggle with.
 
The program is funded entirely by donations and staffed entirely by volunteers. The event creates value without paid staff and without taxpayer involvement.  Your donation will go straight to the physical materials the children will be using to execute their projects, to Hack the Future shirts for children and adult volunteer Mentors, and to your contribution prize (should you select one).
 

To date we have run four successful events, three at the Tech Museum in San Jose and one on the Stanford Campus.  Hack the Future 5 is set to return to the Tech Museum on August 19. Unfortunately, we are struggling to find corporate sponsorship to help cover this specific event. In order to allow our volunteer Mentors to put their focus on designing more amazing startions for the kids to work on, we are now trying to raise the rest of event funds through IndieGoGo.

 
What We Need & What You Get
 
All of the funding collected by this campaign will go directly to materials to run the stations, food and drinks to fuel the kids throughout the event, and the T-shirts we use to keep kids excited and to designate volunteers.
 
We're really excited to offer a some awesome things to our wonderful backers: from your name projected on the wall to a shirt signed by the cofounders, we really want you to understand what an impact you are having on the lives and future opportunities of these children.
 

 
If we do not raise our entire goal, we will still apply all funds to this project. It just means that funds for the event will be coming out of our volunteers' personal pockets. The parents, the kids, and the volunteers have all been blown away by the incredible impact of Hack the Future, and we are absolutely dedicated to this program's success.
 
The Impact
 
The main goal is to empower the kids by helping them to realize that they can be creators of technology and not just consumers of it.
 
Many children, especially as they reach adolesence, struggle to find creative outlets for their energy and time. Hack the Future provides not only a positive outlet for these forces of nature, but gives the children real-world employable skills in a field that traditional education struggles to keep pace with.
 
""This is the first chance many kids will have to enter the exciting, advancing field of technology. Programming is literacy."" 
 
--Joe Mathes, Hack the Future Co-Founder
 
Hack the Future has already offered four events, each teaching between 65-85 students, with many of the students happily returning for more classes and challenges.

With your help, we would like to grow and expand this program to offer these opportunities to more students.
