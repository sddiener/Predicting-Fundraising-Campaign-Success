Since childhood I have struggled to comprehend the tragedies and atrocities of the Holocaust. This project tackles the subject in various ways. I have divided the project into six ""letters"" or scenes: In the Shadow, Papieren, Questioning, Bloodlines, Defiance and Garden Gate.</p>
<p>I am originally from the San Francisco Bay Area where I was raised with my sister and brother by my German mother and American father. I first learned about the Holocaust at the age of eight when my grandmother died. I didn't understand why I had never met my grandmother. How could my mother explain easily the circumstances that had destroyed her family, the imprisonment that had made my grandmother too weak to travel?</p>
<p>I retired from teaching dance for the University of Minnesota, Morris in 2009. After 25 years of working with college students, it is wonderful for me to finally have a chance to work with professional dancers. I have received some funding from the University of Minnesota Retirees Association which will pay the dancers but we need more money to cover all the expenses of our film crew, equipment rental and lighting technicians. When completed, this film will be entered in dance film festivals and made available as a way to teach about this period of history.<br/></p>
<p>By contributing to this campaign you will help in the creation of a powerful exploration of loss of innocence, anti-semitism, hatred, grief, fear, hope and defiance. Everyone comes to grips with the reality of the Jewish Holocaust in different ways. This is my way.<br/></p>

<p><strong>SHORT SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>Hello! It’s Impulse Theatre here. We are a Victoria-based multidisciplinary theatre company specializing in transformative physical performance. We started on a rock in James Bay with our first piece, Conversations with the Sea, in 2010. Since then, we’ve created fifteen original works and facilitated the growth of dozens of local artists and administrators through projects like our annual Peek Fest. </p>
<p>This year, we’re supported by a summer team of administrators and artists who are working tirelessly on a brand-new show to add to Impulse’s catalogue, how to pull your heart out through your throat. </p>
<p>how to pull your heart out through your throat dives into questions of identity, self, and the fabricated “me” we present through social media. With the (very loose) format of an exciting and visceral “how-to” guide, how to pull your heart out through your throat explores questions of individuality, self-creation, and the need to be seen authentically. </p>
<p>This show is a collaborative creation led by Impulse’s Artistic Producer Andrew Barrett. The cast and creative team include local early-career theatre practitioners  Emma Dickerson, Veronica Harland, Chase Hiebert, Rachel Levy, and Julie Mombourquette.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET</strong></p>
<p>This Indiegogo will help us cover the Production Expenses associated with how to pull your heart out through your throat. This means we need money to support: lighting design, set design and construction, props, and costumes. </p>
<p>Impulse Theatre is fortunate enough to have received funding through the Canada Summer Jobs Program, allowing us to cover most of our administrative costs and pay the performing artists involved in this show (above minimum wage!). Everything we raise goes directly towards production costs that come with the creation of new performance!</p>
<p>Of course, it wouldn’t be an Indiegogo campaign without some exciting perks! We’ve got tonnes of ways for you to get to know the Impulse team and get involved in our office life and creative process. So let us make you a playlist or have a live dance party with us via Instagram--we can’t wait!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>EXPENSES </strong></p>
<p><strong>Designer Fees: $650</strong><br/>Administrative and Artist Fees: $6,750<br/><strong>Production/Technical Fees (set, props, and costuming)—$1000</strong><br/>Fringe Application Fee: $620<br/>Marketing Expenses: $350<br/><strong>Indiegogo Fees: $30 </strong></p>
<p><strong>TOTAL EXPENSES   $9,400</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>REVENUES</strong></p>
<p>Box Office: $1150<br/>Canada Summer Jobs Funding: $6,750 <br/><strong>Indiegogo: $1500</strong></p>
<p><strong>TOTAL REVENUE  $9,400</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Even if we don’t make our fundraising goal, all of the money we receive will go towards the production expenses of how to pull your heart out through your throat. Every bit helps offset these expenses!</p>
<p>We recognize that not everyone who gives to this campaign will be able to see the show in person, so we’ve created some exciting perks that will let you be a part of the magic! At some levels, you can purchase a ticket that will be reserved as part of our accessibility program--so someone who might not otherwise be able to see the show will have a chance to do so! AND, for every donation over $100, we’ll donate 15% of what you give to the Victoria Youth Clinic, one of our favourite Not-For-Profit organizations in the city. They provide medical services to youth between 12-24 years of age, with an emphasis on helping at-risk youth. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>IMPACT</strong></p>
<p>Impulse Theatre is a leader in Victoria when it comes to employing emerging artists and providing them with an opportunity to produce and create new work. Without providing artists with these opportunities at home, Victoria risks losing them to other major centres where there’s a greater concentration of work. Your donation helps us encourage and develop the creative ecology in this city, giving the next generation of artists and administrators the option of staying in Victoria while furthering their careers. This will only benefit the city, as artists continue to create work that is responsive to the social issues affecting our region.</p>
<p>This particular show will ask audiences to engage with the concept of their online and offline self and the ways we present our personal “brand” through social media. It will raise questions of authenticity in our behaviour, online and in real life. We hope that audiences will come away questioning their interactions with other people, looking more deeply at themselves and the ways in which we communicate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</strong></p>
<p>Thankfully, our summer team is supported by the Canada Summer Jobs program, but we’re also looking to craft an exciting and thrilling show that is supported by the strong visual and aesthetic elements that Impulse is known for. Without sufficient funds, the artistic vision of the piece will not come to fruition. </p>
<p>Impulse works to keep its prices low and, therefore, accessible year-round. If you think that offering multidisciplinary theatre arts created locally with locally trained artists, please consider donating today. Impulse is an emerging leader and your generosity allows us to establish a foundation in the city. We certainly have our challenges, but we are confident in our work and determined to bring you something new, relevant, and diverse.</p>

<p>The autobiographical production begins with a Hungarian director in Berlin, facing a dilemma: she has been asked to set up a production and she is scared. Her own diversity as a native of Hungary and Berliner by choice prompts some questions: </p>
<p><i>What can, should, must one tell a foreign audience? Is what she has to say even interesting? Will they understand her? </i></p>

- an interactive staged reading 
at GOTHENBURG FRINGE FESTIVAL 2017 | 1th 2nd 3rd of September
 
Three women. A three-headed creature from and between Hungary and Germany. Three theatre-makers. Three points of view. We. We read out loud. We sing sometimes. Wir stellen Fragen. In 14 different languages. About crucial moments. Über Politik. About destiny. About responsibility. About personal issues and priorities. Är det intressant, what we say? Do you understand me? Ymmärrätkö mitä sanon? És ha nem, akkor mi van? 
Does everything have to be understood? When did you ask yourself the last time? When was the last time you had sex on top of a mountain? Do we confront each other with personal questions? Do we react? Does one of us wear a mermaid costume? Do we interact? Do we open? – Yes. We do. Här och nu.

It is their mission to make dance more accessible to a wide range of audiences through collaboration and presentation outside of the traditional theater setting. The company has performed in galleries, outdoor spaces and theaters. Associations have been formed with musicians, visual artists and videographers. They have presented work at Manhattan Movement and Arts Center, The Tank (NYC), Celebrate Downtown (RVA), Green Space (NY) and at Peridance’s APAP Showcase. Through collaboration with her dancers Chloe crafts choreography that fosters intimacy through gesture and attention to detail. The company explores gesture and it’s ability to read as loudly as full-bodied movement. It is their belief that gestures are intrinsically revealing and hands have the ability to communicate experiences and emotions through the slightest movement.<br/><br/>After a year of working in the studio we are extremely excited to be presenting our first evening length work <i>Witness</i> at Dogtown Dance Theatre in Richmond, VA. Dogtown offers artists an incredible space for a more affordable price than theater rentals in larger cities. This will allow us as, a young company to present our work in a state-of-the- art theater. However, we still need your help to make this happen. Your donation will help us continue to grow as a young company. Your gift will go directly to pay for the theater rental, costumes and transportation to Richmond from New York, paying the dancers and staffing the show. We greatly appreciate the support! No amount is too small. <br/><br/>The company is comprised of three VCU dance and choreography graduates and two George Mason dance graduates. After showing excerpts of the evening length work in various informal showings and festivals in New York we are thrilled to be traveling to Richmond where so many of us have dance roots to premiere the completed piece. <br/><br/><i>Witness</i> explores different scenarios as the dancers watch, listen, and react through movement: posing the following questions... How do you react to someone else’s fear? How do you react to your own? Once you witness, do you stay, leave, support, speak the truth? How do you present your evidence and hold yourself accountable? The dancers create a world onstage punctuated with moments of intimacy. Chloe crafts gestural movement which reveals multiple layers and complex relationships. <br/><br/>Chloe will be holding a free community dance-making class at Dogtown Dance Theatre on Saturday June 10th at 2pm.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>As a theatre practitioner, my main interests are in mental health, fantasy, queerness, and cruelty, and I’m a regular collaborator with Sheffield performance artist Charlotte Blackburn. My show aims to engage audiences on the topic of mental illness, using stories from religion and mythology to unpick the ways in which illnesses such as depression force us to see the world in a different way.</p>
<p>I'm making a show about mental health because it's still something that people feel ashamed of, and the experience of dealing with poor mental health is almost impossible to explain. This, sadly, makes it all the more difficult to bear, seek help for, and treat. I want to give people a glimpse into what it's like - how hard it can be, but also how strong and compassionate it can make you, so that we can start understanding and supporting each other better.</p>

We are taught to relinquish the ownership of anything that could potentially inconvenience or usurp the agreed upon power structure. Our voices, our autonomy, the empathy and nuance of our better judgment, we learn to distrust them; to detach from the sinful nature of the flesh.  We are raised that ‘righteousness’ lives in the slight, silent, beige frame of a co-dependent woman, toiling to anticipate and graciously meet the needs of others, a boundary-less servant, without inconvenient emotion or objection. She is smiling, unquestioning support and a tray of Nanaimo bars at the ready…She is a tool to be utilized; A colourful male accessory.  While she buys-in, mistrusts and relinquished her own essential strength, he is safe; righteous, she belongs, she is called ‘Blessed’…</p><p>     But, what happens when someone who you trust as infallible, fails, when the lines blur and the black and white that made you superior can no longer hold the weight of life's messiness? You know you’ve never really fit. You've always felt wrong. But, as the pillars fall, you realize for the first time, that maybe it's not you, maybe you're not fatally flawed and one wrong word or action away from being unlovable or, well, burning for Eternity... maybe you're not broken and there could be another way.  Maybe the failure of the 'gatekeepers' means a door has been left open to somewhere else. Maybe, outside of the Garden; inside of the label of ‘Sinner’ it may not be the dark, mythically dangerous, wilderness warned of since childhood. Fire and brimstone, and judgement, rejection and shame…spiritual death. What if we are strong enough to take the leap off of the righteous dualistic high ground and into ourselves? Breaking down the scaffolded exoskeleton of ideology, and trusting that the ‘sinful nature’ is just bad marketing. What if, by cultivating our voices and owning our bodies, we found, through the arduous, insecure work of rebuilding, a home, a tribe, an orgasm; a connection with everything…what if, in exile, we found the wide open arms of fearless, vulnerable, unclenched, laughing, warrior-love? Out of Eden, eyes watering, feeling a very similar spiritual stirring, alive, welcome, and loved at 3am, sweating, surrounded by 7 foot tall drag queens in 8 inch heels, as we did on a Sunday morning. We build a new foundational home together with open doors to hold space for other exiles. Free to breathe deeply, to lead, to love: as “Sinner”s. What if we found that the darkness outside of the Garden was not spiritual death, but an invitation to start anew, to grow something beautiful, not a tomb, but a womb.</p><p> </p><p>    “Sinner” is the story of such a journey. If Ali Wong, Glennon Doyle and Beyonce created a Musical Comedy about Deconstruction, this is it.  Raised that feminine sexuality is dangerous and all-powerful; all at once taught to repress it as the source of all the world’s sin by her church community AND also to weaponize it, in order to establish a valid place in the world.  Marla was raised to be voiceless, disembodied and codependently performative. She tried, but just naturally didn’t fit, she was too much, too emotional, too big, too loud, too intense… </p><p>    “Sinner” is the comedic musical story of her journey from the Fundamentalist Evangelical church, with its purity culture and chastity rings; Patriarchy and control, through Bible College; the wild west of the escapist Expat life in South Korea, terrible sexual encounters, life lessons in fast forward, and the process of building a new internal foundation of worthiness, spirituality and identity from scratch outside of the evangelical community and framework. Finally, coming to see that this “community”, this church “family”, from the outside, descends dangerously quickly into a fear-based mob mentality, and that the walls of Eden, from exile, are obviously topped with barbed wire…</p><p>    We see her go through the dark night of the soul that arrises as she realizes how she has internalized that Patriarchy; how the voices, shame and expectations that were once deafening from well-meaning parents, the side eye of the judging church hierarchy, and the weaponized words of the Apostle Paul, now reside within her… in her connective tissue, shame, fear and anxiety, once disguised as a righteous, protective conscience, now a self sustaining ecosystem of orgasmless, boundariless, codependent aching, narrated by a voice that perfectly mimics her own. </p><p>    We see Marla brave the wilderness, singularly slashing through the thick brush that exists between the ‘safe’, “straight and narrow” Patriarchal territory of belonging, and the Promised Land, the warm Holy ground of embodied freedom, the land of ‘Sinner’s. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p><strong>How we got here: </strong></p><p>    Marla  Torgerson is a Neo-soul Singer/songwriter from Central Alberta, Canada.  A centre of the Canadian bible belt. While a thinner, more late 90’s style belt, it is a bible belt none the less, and the vibe and fundamentalist evangelical fervour is the same.  </p><p>    Marla has a BAMu in opera and has traveled the world performing, co-writing, and working with many impressive names that she drops whenever possible. </p><p>    Marla wrote the initial draft for “Sinner” whilst living in Sevilla, Spain in the first few months of 2020. Mid March, Miss ‘Rona arrived in force and she was locked down; police with big guns in the streets. Weeks before her planned departure and move from Vancouver to Toronto, she had to find a way home to Canada. Flight after flight, cancelled, all three jobs lined up in TO, along with her apartment sublet there, dissolving before her eyes, she was terrified. She reached out to her friends in Alberta, who also come from her tradition but have since deconstructed. They took action and before long, she was on a flight back to ‘berta on the only flight left leaving the Sevilla airport that day, to an extra condo, which had been furnished and stocked for her quarantine.  A detour back to the Bible belt where she is working with the Alberta Playwright’s Network on the show, and because of its Christian undergirding, people are friendly and helpful, and during a pandemic, that is a truly soothing and beautiful thing. </p><p> </p><p><strong>What We’ll do with the Money:</strong></p><p>    I’m in the middle of the editing phase right now, the pain-staking microsurgery of paring down the origin 100 pages to its core voice.  Working together with Trevor Rueger as dramaturg, Executive Director at the Alberta Playright’s Network, we are listening for what it truly wants to say. This campaign will allow us to workshop the work on a local stage, having a local Artist perform it for myself and a limited team.  We can then play with it, and it will tell us what it needs in order to truly sing.</p><p>    Your support will also allow me to create support materials and a Press Kit to apply for festivals. I will apply for festivals both local and abroad from Edmonton Fringe to Edinburgh Fringe. This campaign is crucial to bringing this story to the world.</p><p>    Beyond these things, it will give me a little breathing room, a little less anxiety, a little more mental calm, in order find the centre and serve the story with greater ease.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What You Get:</strong></p><p>    Well, this is an amazing way to secure your tickets, as all “Original Sinner” tickets will get you pre-sale access to the show of your choice.  You will receive an email 48 hours before tickets go on sale for each show, if you choose to use your tix for that show, simply reply to the email saying as much, and I will reserve some great seats just for you! For those of you who want something special, check out the VIP package.</p><p>    MERCH!! I’m so excited about this! I worked with Calgary jewelry designer, Rachael Hatala, of “Laughing Sparrow” to create a custom ring and necklace just for this campaign, ONLY available for you, the “Original Sinners”. The Ring is a square design, one side reading “SINNER” and the other “SAINT”, depending on how the Spirit is leading you on that particular day ;)</p><p>    I also designed a sweatshirt. This is the beginning of a line of shirts with quotes from the show, but THIS is the first, the OG. The Sweatshirts from this campaign read “Childhood Trauma Made Me Hilarious.   -sinner.” .. I’m sure you can relate </p><p>    I’ve also made “sinner.” t-shirts and toques. The toques even have a rainbow option!!</p><p>    If you want something more personal, maybe a House show is the best option.  After Miss ‘Rona takes her leave, i’ll bring a duo or trio into your living room and do a two hour show for your friends and family. My shows are a mix of soul, folk, rock and originals…with a little classical and broadway thrown in at times, just for shock value… What an amazing way to celebrate being able to stand, mask-less in a room together again!</p><p><strong>Why?:</strong></p><p>    Why did I write this show?  Honestly, I needed it. The music is a culmination of my life as a songwriter and a profesh singer, but the story is a balm that would have truly soothed me on my journey away from everything that felt safe, known, and meaning-making, on the terrifying road into what was totally new, but turned out to be sacred ground. </p><p>    This show is a light, shining from the darkness of exile; meant to give those who feel voiceless or wrong within the “Garden” a beacon to follow, proof of life; a north star into themselves.</p><p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p><p>    To be honest, I’m nervous. This show is big and loud and irreverent and funny.  This show lays bare things that which those in my life would probably rather I keep in the family, things that those in the Fundamentalist Evangelical church would rather I hold with ‘fear and trembling’ instead of making jokes about… </p><p>    There will likely be backlash for me, both personally and from the broader church community…but an army of Karen’s won’t stop me from making this happen.</p><p>    I’m also nervous about how we will get it to the next level and the next after that, but financial help here, means that my reach and my ability to seek help from those who know, is larger. As we build our community of support; a groundswell of likeminded abundance, it will find its’ way to those who need it most.</p><p><strong>Broke as a Joke?? : Here’s Another Way You Can Help</strong></p><p>I know…it’s a pandemic, maybe you’re SUPER into this project, but you lost your job and your mental health is precarious at best! How can you help?? Copy the link to the project and send it, along with a lil’ personal message to your people.</p><p><strong>Reviews: </strong></p><p>""I totally saw this coming.."" -Marla's Childhood Pastor</p><p>""Women should remain silent in the churches, they are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission...Two thumbs down"" -The Apostle Paul</p><p>""Suck in your stomach"" - Marla's mother</p><p>""Too much self promotion, not enough short-term missions trips"" - The Top Wrung Righteous Bitches</p><p>""Those spaghetti straps made me stumble"" - the boner police</p><p>""Marla is apparently now a very chewed up piece of gum"" -Marla's creepy youth pastor in full light wash denim</p><p> </p></div>","Sinner: A Musical Comedy    We, women raised in the Fundamentalist Evangelical church, are trained to be silent, subservient, hunger-less and small.

Mid March, Miss ‘Rona arrived in force and she was locked down; police with big guns in the streets. Weeks before her planned departure and move from Vancouver to Toronto, she had to find a way home to Canada. Flight after flight, cancelled, all three jobs lined up in TO, along with her apartment sublet there, dissolving before her eyes, she was terrified. She reached out to her friends in Alberta, who also come from her tradition but have since deconstructed. They took action and before long, she was on a flight back to ‘berta on the only flight left leaving the Sevilla airport that day, to an extra condo, which had been furnished and stocked for her quarantine.  A detour back to the Bible belt where she is working with the Alberta Playwright’s Network on the show, and because of its Christian undergirding, people are friendly and helpful, and during a pandemic, that is a truly soothing and beautiful thing.  What We’ll do with the Money:    I’m in the middle of the editing phase right now, the pain-staking microsurgery of paring down the origin 100 pages to its core voice.  Working together with Trevor Rueger as dramaturg, Executive Director at the Alberta Playright’s Network, we are listening for what it truly wants to say. This campaign will allow us to workshop the work on a local stage, having a local Artist perform it for myself and a limited team.  We can then play with it, and it will tell us what it needs in order to truly sing.    Your support will also allow me to create support materials and a Press Kit to apply for festivals. I will apply for festivals both local and abroad from Edmonton Fringe to Edinburgh Fringe. This campaign is crucial to bringing this story to the world.    Beyond these things, it will give me a little breathing room, a little less anxiety, a little more mental calm, in order find the centre and serve the story with greater ease. What You Get:    Well, this is an amazing way to secure your tickets, as all “Original Sinner” tickets will get you pre-sale access to the show of your choice.  You will receive an email 48 hours before tickets go on sale for each show, if you choose to use your tix for that show, simply reply to the email saying as much, and I will reserve some great seats just for you! For those of you who want something special, check out the VIP package.    MERCH!! I’m so excited about this! I worked with Calgary jewelry designer, Rachael Hatala, of “Laughing Sparrow” to create a custom ring and necklace just for this campaign, ONLY available for you, the “Original Sinners”. The Ring is a square design, one side reading “SINNER” and the other “SAINT”, depending on how the Spirit is leading you on that particular day ;)    I also designed a sweatshirt. This is the beginning of a line of shirts with quotes from the show, but THIS is the first, the OG. The Sweatshirts from this campaign read “Childhood Trauma Made Me Hilarious.   -sinner.” .. I’m sure you can relate     I’ve also made “sinner.” t-shirts and toques. The toques even have a rainbow option!!    If you want something more personal, maybe a House show is the best option.  After Miss ‘Rona takes her leave, i’ll bring a duo or trio into your living room and do a two hour show for your friends and family. My shows are a mix of soul, folk, rock and originals…with a little classical and broadway thrown in at times, just for shock value… What an amazing way to celebrate being able to stand, mask-less in a room together again!Why?:    Why did I write this show?  Honestly, I needed it. The music is a culmination of my life as a songwriter and a profesh singer, but the story is a balm that would have truly soothed me on my journey away from everything that felt safe, known, and meaning-making, on the terrifying road into what was totally new, but turned out to be sacred ground.     This show is a light, shining from the darkness of exile; meant to give those who feel voiceless or wrong within the “Garden” a beacon to follow, proof of life; a north star into themselves.Risks & Challenges    To be honest, I’m nervous. This show is big and loud and irreverent and funny.  This show lays bare things that which those in my life would probably rather I keep in the family, things that those in the Fundamentalist Evangelical church would rather I hold with ‘fear and trembling’ instead of making jokes about…     There will likely be backlash for me, both personally and from the broader church community…but an army of Karen’s won’t stop me from making this happen.    I’m also nervous about how we will get it to the next level and the next after that, but financial help here, means that my reach and my ability to seek help from those who know, is larger. As we build our community of support; a groundswell of likeminded abundance, it will find its’ way to those who need it most.Broke as a Joke?? : Here’s Another Way You Can HelpI know…it’s a pandemic, maybe you’re SUPER into this project, but you lost your job and your mental health is precarious at best!

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>From our inception in 2018, we have made it our duty to create a place where comedy can be accessible to everyone. From NSFE to our new name, Court of Jesters, we have been committed to creating an inclusive comedic environment where people of all backgrounds and beliefs can laugh at themselves and the world around them.</p>
<p>In March of 2020, COVID-19 forced us to look at comedy in a new way. Starting that March, we have created an online, live-streamed format of comedy that could be shared on multiple social media platforms. We have also achieved great things, including being joined by Libertarian Presidential Candidate Vermin Supreme, as well as completing our debut short film.</p>
<p>Now that the world is reopening, we have started to book live shows! In order to pull off these live shows, we need your help!</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are currently hoping to raise $650 for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Audio and video equipment to project our meager voices and to share our comedy with the internet.</li>
<li>Gas up our cars to reach gigs in far away areas.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you donate, you'll have the chance to receive:</p>
<ul>
<li>High fives</li>
<li>Live shout-Outs</li>
<li>Video roasts</li>
<li>Locks of Richie's chest hair (not really).</li>
<li>And many other things!</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will help us achieve what we set out to do since the inception of our group. We are still committed to and are actively pursuing new ways to make comedy accessible to all people, regardless of who you are.</p>
<p>In the future, we hope to create workshops, compete in festivals, and take over the world of conventional comedy.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with any comedy group, our risks are shared by most comedians and improv groups in the Northeast U.S. Low attendance, double bookings, and other small irritations all present themselves to us at different times, but we know how to handle such things: with dignity, grace, and throwing up a little.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If a monetary donation isn't in the cards for you right now, there are other ways you can help us out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing our Indiegogo page on your respective social media channels.</li>
<li>Following us on social media everywhere @courtofjesters.</li>

Your donations will primarily go towards paying for production elements and our space at 59E59 Theaters. Your support will help us create the world of the play, in this case a zoo, the wilderness, and its ursine inhabitants in a beautiful, unique facility. We can't do it without you. Thank you so much for all of your continued support.
Sans A Production's Mission:
We believe that how we make something is as important as what we make. Sans A Productions was started by five artists from all disciplines of theatre who seek pure collaboration. We give equal weight to all areas of production in order to tell a story thatâs greater than the sum of its parts.

<h3>What makes New Camerata Opera Special?</h3>
<p>How are we planning on building new audiences for opera?</p>
<ul>
<li>We are bringing opera into the digital age with YouTube opera shorts, finally taking advantage of new media platforms.</li>
<li>A large portion of our endeavor is dedicated to introducing young people to opera, through live performances of new children's opera adaptations. </li>
<li>Our full-length MainStage operas will be fresh and full of theatricality, yet musically precise, and stylistically faithful.  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Fundraising Efforts</h3>
<p>Though this campaign is only a portion of our fundraising efforts, the money we raise with it will go a long way in helping us successfully meet our ambitious goals, in our first season.  </p>
<p>Our expenses include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rehearsal and performance venue rentals.</li>
<li>Production staffing.</li>
<li>Costumes, set pieces, lights and equipment rentals.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<ul></ul>
</div><div>
<p>Opera is one of the most challenging forms of theatre to produce, due to its endless number of production-elements (music, dance, acting, sets, costumes, props, etc).  Making operatic movies is even more daunting!  How are we going to pull this off?</p>
<ul>
<li>By ALWAYS living within our means as a company:  we will fundraise as much as we can, but program according to what our season budget is, and what our realistic expenses will be.</li>

<h2><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></h2>
<p><i>Offend-Me-Not!</i> had its first staged reading in New York City at the Magnet Theater Training Center in March of 2017. The show generated a lot of laughs and was followed by such an animated talkback with audience members that I realized the material was not only funny, but socially significant as well. To my surprise, I’d ironically created a “safe space” for audience members from a wide range of racial backgrounds and sexual orientations to share their anxiety about potential ostracism for having opinions that don’t precisely conform to PC orthodoxy. </p>
<p>One audience member asked if I embraced Donald Trump’s version of political incorrectness. This question was not unexpected. In today’s polarized environment, stating that you don’t completely agree with the tenets of political correctness can land you in the Trump camp. I replied emphatically that I do not. What I do champion is a forum for listening to many points of view on the ideological spectrum. The after show discussion offered that opportunity.</p>
<p>  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506445755/woz5rslxhyk0xpflkl49.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>As the audience members talked about their experiences, there was a palpable sense of relief in the room. “When will you be staging this next?” they asked. “How can we keep talking?” They longed to continue the dialogue, and I became determined to make that happen.</p>
<p>This is where I need your help. Enter Indigogo!</p>
<h2><strong>WHAT'S NEXT &amp; WHERE YOU COME IN</strong></h2>
<p>The next step in <i>Offend-Me-Not!'s</i> development is a full production for New York audiences. The footwork I did for the staged reading gave me knowledge of the NYC live entertainment industry, from casting the show and booking venues to getting the word out and staging the production. I will capitalize on this experience to produce the highest quality show possible so that it can continue to educate as it entertains. I will also be hiring a professional videographer to tape this production to have submission material for other performance opportunities in the region and across the US. </p>
<p>The production will require further casting, rehearsal space, venue rental, props, advertising, promotional materials, and my travel to NYC. All of this takes money. That's where you come in. Your donation will be used to pay artists, rental fees, promotional costs, travel expenses, and ideally we'd love a pot of coffee on set every so often. </p>

<p>Casting will begin in January, with rehearsals starting in February for a March production. The rehearsal schedule will include a minimum of seven full cast meetings. Advertising, listing notices, promotion, and publicity for the show will begin as soon as casting is set. The run itself will consist of two shows, both to be videotaped for future use. </p>

I ran a small theater in Cambridge, MA where I directed over 20 productions, several of which won  Best Director awards.  I’ve run groups in hospitals as well as having taught acting at Emerson College in Boston. My comedic stories have been featured on Public Radio International and my solo show, <i>Fritz Perls is my (tor) Mentor</i>, was the winner of the Competition for New Works at San Francisco’s Marsh Theater and the recipient of a grant from the Zellerbach Family Foundation.</p>

X will interweave street dance forms including house, popping, waacking, vogueing, breaking, freestyle hip-hop, documentary theater, choreopoetry, original live song, and interactive video to explore sexual violence. X tells stories of trauma, resilience, and triumph by using interviews with cross-generational, racially and gender diverse survivors of sex trafficking and sexual abuse.

According to Me Too Movement founder, Tarana Burke, how people generally characterize the “me too” movement is incorrect. Her life-affirming work for Black women and global initiative to end sexual violence has in many ways been misrepresented, erased, and relegated to a hashtag.  X RATED PLANET aims to use documentary hip hop theater to honor and uphold Burke’s legacy of critical organizing, as well as center the voices of women of color and survivors. </p><p>Sexual violence is a hidden epidemic. This work challenges pervasive attitudes that demonize those in the roles of “victim” and “perpetrator”; humanize issues of sexual abuse, sex trafficking, structural racism; and bring us closer to root causes of sexual violence. The project draws on restorative justice practices as a methodology for healing everyone impacted by sexual violence and challenges the good/bad dichotomy. </p><p> </p><p><strong>OTHER WAYS TO SUPPORT EP</strong></p><p>Just because you can’t contribute funds to doesn’t mean you can’t be a supporter of EP.  Please help get the word about by sharing this campaign on social media using the Indiegogo share tools.</p><p>For more information, visit embodimentproject.org</p><p> </p></div>","About X RATED PLANETEmbodiment Project is a street dance theater company founded in 2008 by choreographer Nicole Klaymoon.  Our mission is to illuminate narratives silenced by inequities to inspire critical conversation and healing.

We are reaching out to our community to help close the gap so we can access materials for this magical healing prayer of high level hip hop documentary theater and medicine for our community.Campaign funds will go directly towards paying Embodiment Project’s dedicated core company members: Terrence Paschal, George “WuKong” Cheng, Amber Julian, Johnny “JRawKit” Nguyen, Sammay Dizon, Dre “Poco” Devis, Keisha Turner, Rama Mahesh “ButtaGod” Hall, singer/songwriter/cultural ambassador Amikaeyla Gaston, sound healer/vocalist/medicine woman gina Breedlove, DJ/sound design XOA, video artist Meena Murugasan, and restorative justice leader Sonya Shah and The Ahimsa Collective (a network of restorative justice pioneers) and EP’s Founder/Artistic Director Nicole Klaymoon. Donors will receive the following exciting perks!$50 - Your Name on EP's Website$100 - Your Name of EP's Programs$200 - Invitation to observe an EP rehearsal and talk to the company! THE IMPACT19 million sexual trauma survivors recently came forth on twitter by posting ""me too"". According to Me Too Movement founder, Tarana Burke, how people generally characterize the “me too” movement is incorrect. Her life-affirming work for Black women and global initiative to end sexual violence has in many ways been misrepresented, erased, and relegated to a hashtag.  X RATED PLANET aims to use documentary hip hop theater to honor and uphold Burke’s legacy of critical organizing, as well as center the voices of women of color and survivors. Sexual violence is a hidden epidemic. This work challenges pervasive attitudes that demonize those in the roles of “victim” and “perpetrator”; humanize issues of sexual abuse, sex trafficking, structural racism; and bring us closer to root causes of sexual violence. The project draws on restorative justice practices as a methodology for healing everyone impacted by sexual violence and challenges the good/bad dichotomy.  OTHER WAYS TO SUPPORT EPJust because you can’t contribute funds to doesn’t mean you can’t be a supporter of EP.  Please help get the word about by sharing this campaign on social media using the Indiegogo share tools.For more information, visit embodimentproject.org",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p>We are Great Small Works, a collective of 6 theater artists based in New York City, who explore traditional popular theater and puppet forms to make shows reflecting contemporary life.</p>

<p> <strong>WHAT IS TOY THEATER?</strong></p>
<p>Using flat, paper cut-out figures and miniature scenery, Toy Theater (also known as “paper theater” and “model theater”) originated with 19th-century advances in printing and engraving. The original toy theaters of Europe were complete dramas modeled on stage hits of the day, do-it-yourself home entertainment kits containing scripts, characters, and scenery which you could take home, assemble, and perform for friends and family.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHY TOY THEATER?</strong></p>
<p>We discovered the medium during the countdown to the first Gulf War in 1990 when, inspired by Walter Benjamin’s notion of a culture in a permanent “state of emergency,” and responding to the banal terror of the mass media, we began a topical serial drama using texts and images cut from the daily news. This began our engagement with the form, and we have been creating original Toy Theater shows ever since, teaching Toy Theater to people of all ages, and inspiring both performing and visual artists to do their own Toy Theater experimentations.  This is a do-it-yourself storytelling form which can be elaborate yet simple, grand yet inexpensive, full of deep critical thinking yet accessible to all.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>A TOY THEATER FESTIVAL?</strong></p>
<p>Twenty years ago a few Great Small Workers were hauling stuff across First Avenue in the East Village and thought: if we find this form so compelling, maybe there are other contemporary artists doing the same thing. Why not produce a festival of Toy Theater? Would we find enough performers? Would anyone come? Could there be a museum in the lobby for artists who, perhaps, had <em>made</em> toy theaters but were not performers?</p>
<p>As it turned out, there were lots of toy theater makers, performers, designers, collectors and animators out there. Many did not yet know they would become consumed by the form. Great Small Works' first Toy Theater Festival took place in 1993.</p>
<p>Twenty years of growth – and <em>nine</em> festivals later – Great Small Works is embarking on its <strong>10<sup>th</sup> International Toy Theater Festival and Temporary Toy Theater Museum</strong> at the new St. Ann’s Warehouse at 29 Jay Street in DUMBO, Brooklyn, June 14-23, 2013.</p>

<p>As ever, our programs will juxtapose the traditional with the contemporary, and inspire the public to do it themselves. We will present ten days of performances by artists from all around the world and all around the neighborhood—Facto Teatro from Mexico City, New Model Theatre from Ramsgate, England, Janie Geiser from Los Angeles, Erik Ruin from Providence, Clare Dolan from Vermont, Ensemble Pi from Manhattan, Drama of Works from Brooklyn, and many others. The festival will include performances for adult audiences, performances for family audiences, a workshop for all ages, two symposia, and the Temporary Toy Theater Museum, an extensive exhibit of new and historic Toy Theaters, which is open free to the public.</p>

<p><strong>Our festival needs money!</strong>  Ticket sales cover the costs of marketing and production.  But we need support to host dozens of artists coming from around the globe--airfare, food, local transportation, and visas.  $500 pays for a ticket from Mexico City; $750 pays to rent a mini-van for 10 days; $400 pays for a shared meal in our studio.  We ask you to show your appreciation for these generous artists who will bring their work to Brooklyn.  </p>

<h3>The Show:</h3>
<p><span> After reading a poem by Margaret Atwood (The Line: 5 Variations) NP was inspried to begin creating a new piece exploring lines that existed in their own lives. Upon discovering the the raw and industrial space of Auxiliarly Crossfit, <em>Fragments</em> began its development using site specific awareness paired with aerial dance, movement and text to explore the human condition in relation to lines. </span></p>
<p>The team began exploring 2 dimensional and 3 dimensional lines that exist. Including the lines that we see on a page; the physical lines we can create with our bodies, or the invisible divide between what we feel and what we decide to show. </p>
<p>  With all these questions and curiosities, NP has been on a rollercoaster of creation pushing themselves phyically and emotionally as they navigate their way through this daring and exhilerating process. </p>
<h3><span>The Team:</span></h3>
<p><em>Director:</em> Katelyn McCulloch</p>
<p><em>Stage Management:</em> Sandra Dagovic</p>
<p><em>Performers and contributors:</em>Brittany Smith, Michela Canon, Katelyn McCulloch, Taliya Cohen, Kadri Hansen</p>
<p><em>Design:</em> George Quan (lighting), Aaron Bernstein (sound)</p>
<h3><span>What we need:</span></h3>
<p><span>We have chosen a unique venue to execute this piece; Auxiliary Crossfit. The space is very industrial and raw and while it has been very important to our creation it also holds challenges.  We need help from this campaign to bring in lights and sound into our space. We also need specific aerial equipment to ensure that we can hang safely from the ceiling as we are creating this piece. We also want to make sure we have chairs in which our audience can come, sit and enjoy the show!</span></p>

<p><strong>The skinny...</strong></p>
<p>My name is Megan Morse Jans and I am currently an MFA candidate in dance at the University of Maryland College Park.  I am blessed to be able to spend my days speaking about the intricacies of our art form, dancing with amazing friends and colleagues, and serving the student body of the university as a Graduate Teaching Assistant.  The course I teach is Dance Appreciation, where I get to share with my students how dance and culture intertwine and help them see the importance and value of an arts education.  Truly...I'm a lucky gal.</p>
<p>For a long time, I have been a fan of Batsheva Dance Company and very interested in the work of its artistic director Ohad Naharin.  Naharin has created a language of movement he calls Gaga.  It is an improvisational technique that stimulates incredible creativity and feels amazing.  This summer I have the opportunity to study this technique, in depth, at the Gaga Summer Intensive in Tel Aviv, Israel.   </p>
<p>For me, this is the chance of a lifetime.  I am wife and mommy, living my dream of deeply studying my art form, but life as an artist is not exactly...lucrative.  The reality is that on my own, I cannot afford this trip.  I have received funding from the university to attend the intensive, but it will not cover everything.</p>
<p>Through this amazing journey, I hope to not only to have a wonderful and enriching experience as an artist, but to bring back this experience and share it with my students as well. I feel like one of the best gifts I can give them as their teacher, is a worldview.  So please, will you help me see the world? </p>
<p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get...</strong></p>
<p>Through this campaign, I hope to raise $3000 toward my trip to Tel Aviv.  This, along with the funding I will receive from UMD, will pay for travel to Israel, lodging for my two-week stay, tuition for the intensive, local travel to and from the intensive, and food (hey...a dancer's gotta eat, right?)</p>
<p>I've created the following perks for donating:</p>
<p>$10 A thank you note.</p>
<p>I would promise a handwritten one, but my handwriting is so bad I will spare you the strain of trying to interpret it.  I will mail you a thank you note filled with my deepest gratitude!</p>
<p>$25 A postcard from the Holy Land</p>
<p>While I am in Israel, I will send you a postcard from the Holy Land (I will do my best to write legibly)!</p>
<p>$100 A picture of me dancing in Israel (and a postcard)</p>
<p>Not only will I send you a postcard, but also upon my return I will send you a picture along with a written account of my adventures and a-ha moments on this life-changing trip.</p>

<p>I will send you a postcard from Israel as well as a picture and reflections on this amazing journey, and I will also create a video retrospective of the trip where I will thank you by name.  It will be posted on my website <a href=""http://www.meganmorsejans.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.meganmorsejans.com</a>.</p>
<p>In the event that I only raise part of the money, it will still go toward this trip.  I believe firmly that this is an important experience and I am committed to raising this money.  Even if it means I have to have a bikini car wash.  And I am really, really pale so please let's spare the greater Annapolis area the blindness they will all suffer as a result of the glare coming off of me in a bikini, and make this campaign a success by donating.</p>

We roared at the childish absurdity in Jarry's <em>Ubu Roi</em>, wept at the passionate tragedy in Llorca's <em>Blood Wedding</em>, sang along with the dismal dialectic in Brecht's <em>The Threepenny Opera</em>, and squirmed at the stark claustrophobia in Ibsen's <em>Ghosts</em>. </span></p>
<p><span class=""notranlsate"">Now, the members of Lorem Ipsum are honored to announce that we will present Erin Shields' award-winning <em>If We Were Birds</em> as part of Portland Stage Company's inaugural <a href=""http://www.portlandstage.org/Page.168.Studio+Rep"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Studio Rep</a> series.<a href=""http://www.portlandstage.org/Page.168.Studio+Rep%5D"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><br/></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span class=""notranlsate"">Through the lens of a traditional Greek tragedy (the story of Procne, Philomela, and Tereus, from Ovid's <em>Metamorph</em></span><em>osis)</em>, <em>If We Were Birds</em> confronts the concept of rape as a tool of war, featuring a chorus of women whose words were inspired by testimonials of female survivors from contemporary conflicts. At turns shocking and beautiful, this play is brutally honest, magical, inspiring, and, in the end, surprisingly human.</strong></p>
<p><em>""When I first read </em>If We Were Birds<em>, I knew immediately that I had to do it. So much about it spoke to me: the beautiful language, which seamlessly melds the ancient and the modern, the timeless relevance of the material, the fact that it offers seven powerful roles for seven powerful actresses, how fearlessly it tackles topics that we often shy away from -- including the hidden costs of war (those that people don't see and those that are concealed), rape, women's lack of agency, how violence is blind to privilege, and the varied, sometimes troubling, ways in which we (try to) heal.

<p>Lorem Ipsum</p>
<p>(Claire, Corey, Deirdre, Ian, Nick, Mike &amp; Tess)</p></div>","Over the past three years, Lorem Ipsum has staged four energetic and physical productions of timeless scripts that range from the frivolously ridiculous to the brutally emotional. We roared at the childish absurdity in Jarry's Ubu Roi, wept at the passionate tragedy in Llorca's Blood Wedding, sang along with the dismal dialectic in Brecht's The Threepenny Opera, and squirmed at the stark claustrophobia in Ibsen's Ghosts. 
Now, the members of Lorem Ipsum are honored to announce that we will present Erin Shields' award-winning If We Were Birds as part of Portland Stage Company's inaugural Studio Rep series.
Through the lens of a traditional Greek tragedy (the story of Procne, Philomela, and Tereus, from Ovid's Metamorphosis), If We Were Birds confronts the concept of rape as a tool of war, featuring a chorus of women whose words were inspired by testimonials of female survivors from contemporary conflicts. At turns shocking and beautiful, this play is brutally honest, magical, inspiring, and, in the end, surprisingly human.
""When I first read If We Were Birds, I knew immediately that I had to do it. So much about it spoke to me: the beautiful language, which seamlessly melds the ancient and the modern, the timeless relevance of the material, the fact that it offers seven powerful roles for seven powerful actresses, how fearlessly it tackles topics that we often shy away from -- including the hidden costs of war (those that people don't see and those that are concealed), rape, women's lack of agency, how violence is blind to privilege, and the varied, sometimes troubling, ways in which we (try to) heal. I think that it's important to bring these issues to Portland audiences. There are women in this city, including immigrants and refugees, who have dealt with and witnessed scenes like the ones described in the play. Our country is currently at war, but often all we read are sanitized reports of those conflicts, if that. Violence is perpetrated against women in many ways, and I believe we ought to confront that. We need to have these discussions and often art is a catalyst to start them.""

<p><strong>Hi, my name is Sharona Florsheim</strong>. I’m the choreographer of ‘<strong>The Big Game</strong>’ and I invite you to be our partners in bringing this dance event to its fulfillment, and more! </p>
<p><strong><em>The Big Game</em></strong><em> invites the audience to enter an absurd world composed of games which have been made up and are played out by four dancers on stage in real time. The various games expose the emotional world of the dancers and the power relations between them. The piece raises questions about the purpose of the game, who sets the rules and how these rules influence the interaction between the players, how far the players would go to achieve a desired outcome, and what happens if the rules are broken. It questions our sense of free choice and understanding of responsibility as players in our own personal or social games.</em></p>
<p><strong>We wish to tour The Big Game and perform it to people in outlying communities. We need your help in raising $9,300 and cover the performances basic costs. </strong></p>
<p>We’ve worked in the studio for almost five months and had a very successful premiere a few weeks ago. We’ve partly covered the costs of the production until now and in order to continue to perform this highly communicative dance event, we need your support. We wish to tour all over the country and share The Big Game with people from different backgrounds and communities. To make it happen we need your help to cover the basic expenses of each performance which include the dancers' and musician's wages, travel expenses, theatre rental and administration. When we have the majority of our costs covered we can offer the tickets for a very low price. This is especially relevant when touring to communities where people are less exposed to the art of dance and are economically challenged. These $9,300 are two thirds of the actual budget for 8 performances. The more money we raise the more performances we can do!</p>
<p>The amazing and devoted cast of The Big Game is committed to this social vision. We believe art can make a difference in the heart of everyone. We believe dance is for everyone.</p>

</div></div>","Lord, what food these mortals be!  Bram Stoker’s Dracula collides with Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night’s Dream in a puckishly ‘biting’ woodland mashup where no ruffled neck is safe. Join us, if you dare, for the ORIGINAL douchey teen vampire drama.  The Nightmare 'Dream' comes to the New York International Fringe Festival in August 2013, presented by Bloody Shakespeare.
 
The play, approximately 50 minutes in length, uses text only from the two source works.  Writer/director Neal J. Freeman's original plan was to develop a Midsummer production with a gothic horror setting, to give a playful wink to the idea that the Elizabethans thought of ""fairies"" in a much more sinister way than we are accustomed to.  Upon beginning to locate the Shakespeare characters within a horror universe, Freeman discovered surprising parallels to the characters in Stoker's Dracula, and The Nightmare 'Dream' was born!
 
Bloody Shakepseare is Neal J. Freeman and producer Heather Siobhan Curran.  We worked together for three years as Executive Director and Artistic Director of Brooklyn's acclaimed The Gallery Players and collaborated there on over a dozen productions.  Having left the organization in May 2012, we are excited to renew our collaboration on the world premiere of The Nightmare 'Dream'.
 
We are working from a budget of $7,500 for this festival production.  The largest part of this goes to paying the actors and creative team for their work, per the terms of the Actors' Equity Association agreement with FringeNYC.  Your contribution here assures we have enough left over to pay for costumes, rehearsal space, and the many other miscellaneous expenses needed to get us to the finish line!  
 
We are excited to offer illustrations by Michael C. Malbrough (who illustrated our logo) as perks for our higher level donors.  Mike will take a photo you provide (of you or another person) and ""mash it up"" with a horror icon of your choice (Dracula, Frankenstein, whatever you choose) to create a custom caricature just for you! View samples of Mike's work.
 
More about us:  Neal is a member of SDC and holds an MFA in Directing from Brooklyn College and a BA in Theater Arts from Cornell University.  His play A Letter from Bataan was a 2012 and 2013 semi-finalist for the Eugene O'Neill Center National Playwrights Conference.  As Artistic Director of The Gallery Players from 2003-2012, Heather directed, produced, or executive produced dozens of shows during her tenure, earning the theater over two dozen New York Innovative Theater Awards and nominations. She is currently on the board of New York Theatre Barn developing new works and is a member of the League of Professional Theatre Women.
 
Thank you for considering making a donation, and helping us produce the world premiere of this brand new play!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Ok here is a short summary of me:</p>
<p>I love small business and I love the arts.  I have done both for over 40 years and as long as that sometimes sounds I still have some kick left in me!  I had a dinner theatre when I was much younger and I learned many of the in's and outs of both a small business and running a theatre.  I have my Masters degree and years of experience in theatre and television, as well as marketing and fund raising.  My goal is to start a bar that has incredible entertainment that is accessible to everyone. A place where artists and audience can meet to create a great experience.</p>
<p>I feel that quite often there is a mysticism to the arts that can intimidate people unfamiliar and thus not be enjoyed.  Theatre in the days of Shakespeare were for the common man and accompanied by a pint, something to nosh and rowdy behavior.  The art experience is a wonderful way to feel emotions, work through issues, connect with the world, find humor in every corner and engage with other humans.  I want to make this a gathering place for artists, for those who love the arts and those who don't yet know how to appreciate them.  By having a great space, the amazing talent in this city, whether it is photography, film, theatre or something else, will have a venue to show their talent,  people that have no experience with the arts will hopefully feel comfortable to give it a shot and those who have the desire without the experience will have a place to learn.<br/></p>
<br/><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>Your contribution will help make this happen,  You will be a part of impacting people, the city and the artistic community.  Your participation will help directly with the brick and mortar, with the opportunities available for the artistic and will give you something fun and different to experience. So often the creation of a new business, as well as the appreciation of the arts is limited to those with money.  You are allowing the impact of theatre, film, dance and all visual arts to be brought to the masses.<br/><p></p>

We all have dreams and sometimes have to sacrifice what we love most to achieve them. When Dennis and Amanda decide to leave the island of Puerto Rico to pursue professional success on the stages of New York they leave behind, two broken hearts. I Catch You Dreaming examines the consequences of renouncing to honest love for a Dream of success, the harshness that the Latino community still faces when they move to the states to pursue their goals, the gentrification of the city’s neighborhoods, the discrimination against actors of different ethnicity inside audition rooms and the survival skills our community need to learn the hard way.

<span></span><span><p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p></span>Hello!<span><br/></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><span><br/></span>I am Mauro Pasqualini, a member of the company Borgobonó and director of the play </span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>In Any Case No Remorse</b>,</i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> based on the eponymous novel by Pino Cacucci, and </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I'm here to ask for your help in mounting our new, deep, lively and moving show</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">.</span>
</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p><br/></p>
<p>With <i>In Any Case No Remorse</i> we want to bring to life the history of Victor Kibalchich, Commissioner Jouin, Jules Bonnot, Rirette Maitrejean, Raymond Callemin and many others. Real men and women who existed, with different visions of reality, but all sharing the desire to live in a world that is Right.</p>
<p>But what is this ""Right"" world?<span><br/></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">For some of them it’s the one into which they were born, for others it’s the one that comes after a revolution, and for still others it does not yet exist and must be forged anew.<br/></span></p>
<p><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">In Any Case No Remorse</i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> is an investigation, made without taking sides, walking the fine line between what seems true and what is true. But is a singular “truth” real? What does it mean to be “true”?</span></p>
<blockquote> <b>Victor:</b> <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Commissioner Jouin, the real reason I cannot find peace in this life is that I can never see things simply. I wish I could be content with some easy slogans of elementary reasoning. Everything is so darn complex, constantly adding to doubts to doubts. There is but one simple thing in this reality in which we’re forced to live; you and I are natural enemies.</span>
</blockquote>
<blockquote> <b>Commissioner Jouin:</b> <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">You are free not to believe me, but I do not believe myself to be your enemy.</span>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>                                      <span style=""font-weight: normal;""> from ""In Any Case, No Remorse"" by Pino Cacucci<span><br/></span><span><br/></span></span>
</blockquote>
<p>We deeply believe that <b>this show and these stories</b> – of people who lived at the beginning of 1900’s, an era that is in a way a mirror to our own – <b>have the ability to speak directly to our present-day audiences.</b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>

<h2><b>IN ANY CASE NO REMORSE<span><br/></span></b></h2>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><span><br/></span>At the turn of the XX century </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">in Europe and beyond, a group of persons defined by history as anarchists - a title under which gathered anyone who stood outside the status quo - confronted the problems of social inequality and the struggle of the proletariat. Some chose the path of media, through newspapers, books and treatises on philosophy; others chose to attack what those in power held most dear: the Capital. Still others chose both.<span><br/></span></span><br/></p>
<p>Protagonists of In Any Case No Remorse: policemen, anarchists, philosophers, prostitutes, politicians, workers and many others.</p>
<p>All guilty. All innocent. All victims. All executioners.</p>

<span><br/></span>WHAT YOUR DONATION DOES<br/>
</h2>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><span><br/></span>Your donation will allow us to complete the Part II of the show.<span><br/></span></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Yes, </span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">In Any Case No Remorse </i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">is a show in two parts, and Part I debuted in Milan in June 2014 to great acclaim. But on its own it’s incomplete. That's why we’re asking you to help us.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span></span></p>
<p><b>We need € 6,000 to complete our show.<span><br/></span></b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p>The estimated <b>prep time is 2 months</b>, divided into 3 periods between January and April 2015, and includes the participation of 3 actors, 1 musician, 1 movement curator, and 1 director, for a total of <b>6 people</b>.</p>
<p><b>The funds will cover expenses during construction and rehearsal,</b> <b>not salaries</b>. We believe strongly that this show, when finished, will walk with his own legs and will repay us for all the work done.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><u>The € 6000 breaks down as follows:</u></p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<b>€ 1,000</b> - Travel: <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We come from four different regions in Italy, and this in itself incurs substantial costs for working together. We are taking advantage of artistic residencies in several Italian theaters: this allows us to avoid the expense of rehearsal rent, but it still requires a periodic and costly moving of the set through Italy.</span>
</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>€ 1500</b> - Food: <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We have budgeted for communal grocery shopping to minimize costs. It is minimal, but we are committed to having one bottle of wine to toast our work and all those who are supporting us!</span>
</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>€ 3,500 </b>- Rent: <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">All players in this project have given up other jobs to devote their full time to <i>In Any Case No Remorse.</i> We believe that specificity and care are the basis for quality work.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span></span>
</li></ul>
<p><b>And if you are unable to reach € 6,000?</b><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span>We believe in our work and in its quality, and that this will allow us to reach the IndieGogo goal we have set. But if we don’t, even a fraction of the amount would be of great help to us as we carry on with the show.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span></p>
<p><i>In Any Case No Remorse</i> has already rehearsed <b>more than 100 days in 8 different artistic residencies:</b></p>

<h2 style=""font-weight: bold;"">THEMES: “What's right to do?”</h2>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><i><br/></i></p>
<p><i>“What is the right thing to do?”</i></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></p>
<p>Who has never asked this question? How many times have you, when faced with an important decision, felt the world’s weight and time’s shrinkage, the fear of the wrong choice making you hesitate, forcing you to bow your head and accept life simply as it is?</p>
<p>The response of Jules, Jouin, Platano, Rirette, Victor and all the characters of this show - all real people – is one, cried in unison:<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> <b>Do not hesitate but do it, so that no one will never have the opportunity to recriminate that you hadn't at least tried.</b></span></p>
<p>All the characters in this show try. They try to change the world and make it fairer, try to bring order and make the nation safe, try to shore up their company or their country, try to grow their love, their children. Simply, they try to create a better life for themselves. But life, being life, does not offer solutions, only nuances and complications: the scream of, ""The bosses are all Pigs!” falls on a boss like Dupre, who treats his driver with respect and friendship; the slogan ""the subversives are all violent "" is countered by fine thinkers as Victor Kibalchich; and the belief ""the cops are all bastards"" comes up against a researcher of the truth, Commissioner Jouin.</p>
<p>And it is here, at this intersection of ideals and real lives, that we find the soul of the piece. <br/>Because every time an easy, reassuring solution comes forward, as the idea of an enemy to be defeated or the possibility of a scapegoat to take blame, a new encounter surprises us, and the solid supports we had dissolve under our feet, leaving us at the mercy of an eternal insecurity. This is for us the focus of the show and the point from which our research grew.</p>
<p>Our goal is to feed and nurture this uncertainty in the public, so that the audience leaves the theater with a concrete question: whose side would you take? A question that we often answer quickly, instinctively, but which, if really analysed, is much more complex: should I take the side of those who fight the violence  of the power , or the side of the Power that fights the violent? </p>
<p>The piece addresses contemporary issues, even though they play out at the turn of the 20th century. We talk of <b>rights</b>, and of their <b>lack</b>. Primarily the right to <b>work</b>, of how its absence leads to the loss of <b>dignity</b> and how the lack of dignity leads people to commit <b>extreme acts</b> in an attempt to earn one. We speak of the <b>desire</b> for a just state that guarantees a decent <b>life</b>, that gives <b>voice</b> to all and acts  in <b>legality</b> and <b>transparency</b>,  but also about the desire of the state itself and of it's  officials of ensuring <b>safety</b> and a <b>protection</b> to its citizens from those that frequently, in the name of social justice, act against that same society. We talk about the <b>denial</b> of <b>freedom</b> of speech and the choice between <b>utopia</b> and <b>realism</b>. We question ourselves about the difference between ""<b>rebellion</b>"" and ""<b>revolution</b>,"" and we ask ourselves how thin the line between <b>fight</b> and <b>terrorism</b> is.</p>
<p><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">And the more the work progresses, the more the show grows, the more it reveals how all this speaks to us about today. </b>And so we continue to work and discover, trying not to take sides, trying to stay on that delicate middle ground where we often find the truth. The themes of this piece are too big, too present and too vital to relegate to a mere manifesto of an idea.<span><br/></span></p>

<p>We strongly believe that diversity is an inexhaustible source of  creativity, and we wanted it to be one of the main charatteristics of our  project. For this reason all  the components come from different schools and theaters .</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 style=""font-weight: bold;"">MUSIC SCENE</h2>
<div><br/></div>
<p>Another key strength of our show is the music.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>All songs of <i>In Any Case No Remorse</i> are played live and composed for the show by Adele Pardi</b>, </span>cellist, singer, composer, winner of the first prize in the Acoustic Festival of Trento, Prize winner Pavanello Young Songwriter 2012, and an integral part of Borgobonó.</p>
<p>Adele works with the director and actors, composing during the rehearsals and complementing the work onstage. The music of <i>In Any Case No Regret</i> is never a soundtrack, but rather another character with a story of its own.</p>
<h2 style=""font-weight: bold;"">
<span><br/></span><br/>
</h2>
<h2 style=""font-weight: bold;"">MATERIALS AND MOVEMENT</h2>
<div><br/></div>
<p>One of the first points to be clarified was how we used the stage.<br/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The story of </span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">In Any Case No Remorse</i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> unfolds between Italy, England, Belgium, and many cities of France, in a constant succession of scene changes, indoors and out. For this reason we needed a space that would tell its own story, but that would allow the audience to follow us; a space that would be ready to change with us as we go. The solution was a blank stage. Thanks to this, a mere word or glance is enough to change space and time. It highlights the human relationships: in the absence of any other setting, they are the ones creating the world around themselves.</span></p>
<p>At this point we needed something to make the space concrete.</p>
<p>Two points we felt could be highlighted: factory work, and the revolution that involved the invention and spread of cars. We chose to use pallets and bicycle wheels as the only props. They are basic materials, wood and iron, and evoke a feeling of concrete work in the steel mills and humble housing; they are capable, given their form, ""crude"", and able to give substance to different images, thanks to the ability of the manipulator and the imagination of the viewer. </p>
<p>The show thus develops, relying entirely on the four actors who continue to exchange the roles of narrators, characters and manipulators of objects, crafting many locations and many different people.</p>

<p>Ciao!<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span></p>
<p>Sono Mauro Pasqualini, membro della compagnia Borgobonó e regista dello spettacolo teatrale <i><b>In Ogni Caso Nessun Rimorso</b></i> ispirato all'omonimo romanzo di Pino Cacucci e<b> sono qui per chiederti un aiuto per completare il nostro nuovo, profondo, vivo e toccante spettacolo.</b></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Con <i>In Ogni Caso Nessun Rimorso</i> vogliamo portare in teatro la storia di Victor Kibalcic, del commissario Jouin, di Jules Bonnot, di Rirette Maîtrejean, di Raymond Callemin e di molti altri ancora. Uomini e donne realmente esistiti, con visioni differenti della realtà, ma tutti accomunati dal desiderio di vivere in un mondo giusto.<br/></p>
<p>Ma qual'è il mondo ""giusto""?<span><br/></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Per alcuni di loro è quello in cui sono nati, per altri quello che può venire dalla rivoluzione, per altri ancora quello che non esiste e va cercato.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<i>In Ogni Caso Nessun Rimorso </i>è una ricerca, fatta senza schierarsi, senza prendere le parti di nessuno, rimanendo su quella sottile linea dove si nasconde la verità. Ma una sola verità è possibile?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<blockquote>
<b>Victor:</b> <i>Commissario Jouin il vero motivo per cui non trovo pace in questa vita
è che non riesco mai a vedere le cose semplicemente. Magari potessi
accontentarmi di certe facili parole d’ordine di ragionamenti elementari. Tutto
è così maledettamente complesso da aggiungere costantemente dubbi a dubbi. C’è
una sola cosa semplice in questa realtà che ci hanno costretti a vivere; lei e
io siamo nemici naturali.</i>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<b>Commissario Jouin:</b><b style=""font-style: normal;""> </b><i>E’ libero di non credermi ma io non mi sento
suo nemico.<span><br/></span></i><span><br/></span><p>                                             da ""In ogni caso nessun rimorso"" di Pino Cacucci</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<span>Crediamo profondamente che questo spettacolo e queste storie di persone vissute a inizio '900, in un epoca che è a suo modo specchio di quella contemporanea, abbiano la capacità di<b> parlare in modo diretto <b>del nostro presente </b>agli spettatori di oggi.</b></span>
<p><br/></p>

<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h2>IN OGNI CASO NESSUN RIMORSO</h2>
<br/><p>A cavallo tra ‘800 e ‘900,
in Europa e non solo, un gruppo di persone definite dalla storia come anarchici
– sotto il cui titolo veniva raggruppato tutto ciò che non era in accordo con
lo <i>status quo</i> – si pose il problema
di come risolvere la disuguaglianza sociale e migliorare la condizione del
proletariato. Alcuni scelsero la via mediatica attraverso giornali, libri e
trattati di filosofia; altri scelsero di attaccare il potere in ciò che gli era
più caro: il Capitale. Altri le scelsero entrambe.</p>
<p><br/>
Protagonisti di <i>In ogni caso nessun rimorso</i>: poliziotti, anarchici,
filosofi, prostitute, politici, operai e molti altri ancora. </p>
<p>Tutti colpevoli. Tutti
innocenti. Tutti vittime. Tutti carnefici.</p>
<p><br/></p>

</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<div><br/></div>
<div>La tua donazione ci permetterà di completare la <i>Parte II</i> dello spettacolo.</div>
<div style="""">
<p>Già, <i>In Ogni Caso Nessun Rimorso </i>è uno
spettacolo diviso in due parti e la <i>Parte
I  </i>ha già debuttato a Milano a Giugno 2014 riscuotendo davvero un ottimo successo. Ma da sola è incompleta. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Ecco perché ti chiediamo
di aiutarci</span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">.</i></p>
<p><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></i></p>
<p><b>Abbiamo
bisogno di </b><b>6.000€</b><b> per completare il nostro spettacolo.</b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p>Questa
è la cifra di cui abbiamo bisogno per coprire le spese legate all’allestimento.<br/></p>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">6.000
euro di soli rimborsi,niente altro: </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">in questa cifra non è previsto alcun tipo di pagamento per le persone coinvolte.</b>
</div>
<p>Quello che ti chiediamo è di aiutarci a raccogliere i fondi che ci permetteranno di sostenere le spese
vive durante l’allestimento. Crediamo infatti fermamente che questo spettacolo,
una volta terminato, camminerà con le sue gambe e potrà ripagarci per tutto il
lavoro fatto.</p>
<p>Il
periodo stimato per l’allestimento è
di <b>2 mesi di lavoro</b> suddivisi in 3 periodi
tra Gennaio e Aprile 2015 e prevede la partecipazione di 3 attori, 1 musicista,
1 curatrice dei movimenti scenici e 1 regista, per un totale di <b>6 persone</b>.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><u style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Nei 6000 € che vi stiamo chiedendo di sostenere sono

<p></p>
<ul><li>
<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">1000 €</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">
<b>- Viaggi:</b>   Veniamo da 4 regioni italiane differenti e
questo comporta di per sé notevoli costi per lavorare insieme. Inoltre, per
quanto riguarda la sala-prove, stiamo usufruendo di residenze artistiche in
diversi teatri italiani: questo ci permette di non dover sostenere costi di
affitto per lo spazio, ma ci obbliga comunque a un periodico e costoso trasloco
della scenografia attraverso l’Italia.</span>
</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">1500 €</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">
<b>- Vitto:</b>   Abbiamo
preventivato una spesa alimentare comunitaria per ridurre al minimo i costi. E’
minima ma ci impegniamo a prendere una bottiglia di vino per brindare al nostro
lavoro e a tutti quelli che lo stanno sostenendo!</span><br/>
</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">3500 €</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">
<b>- Affitto:</b>   Tutti i componenti di questo progetto hanno
rinunciato ad altri lavori per poter dedicare a pieno il loro tempo
all’allestimento di In ogni Caso Nessun Rimorso. Siamo convinti che la
specificità e la cura siano la base per un lavoro di qualità. </span>

<h2><b>TEMATICHE: ""Cosa è giusto fare?""</b></h2>
<div>
<h3>
</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p><i>Qual’è la cosa giusta da fare?</i></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Chi non si è mai
posto questa domanda? Quante volte nel momento di prendere una decisione
importante, mentre il mondo ci schiaccia e il tempo si restringe, la paura di
rispondere nel modo sbagliato a questa domanda ci fa esitare e ci blocca
costringendoci a chinare la testa e accettare la vita così come viene? <span><br/></span>La
risposta di Jules, Jouin, Platano, Rirette, Victor e tutti i personaggi di
questo spettacolo – tutti realmente esistiti - è una e all’unisono: <b>non
esitare, fare, perché così in futuro nessuno ci potrà recriminare che non
abbiamo almeno tentato</b>.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Tutti i personaggi
di questo spettacolo tentano. Tentano di cambiare il mondo e renderlo più equo,
tentano di portare l’ordine e rendere la nazione sicura, tentano di
amministrare al meglio la loro azienda o il loro paese, tentano di far crescere
al meglio il loro amore, i loro figli o più semplicemente tentano di creare
almeno per sé una vita migliore. Ma la vita, in quanto vita, non offre
soluzioni dirette, solo una infinità di sfumature e complicazioni: all’urlo ""<i>I padroni sono tutti dei porci</i>” risponde con padroni come Dupré che trattano il
loro autista con rispetto e amicizia, allo slogan “<i>I sovversivi sono tutti
violenti</i>” contrappone fini pensatori come Victor Kibalcic,  e al credo “<i>I poliziotti sono tutti bastardi</i>”
mette davanti un fine ricercatore
della veritàcome il commissario
Jouin.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">E’ qui che l‘anima che nasce da questo incrocio di
vite affiora. <span><br/></span></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Perché tutte le volte che una soluzione facile, rassicurante,
come l’idea di un nemico da sconfiggere o la possibilità di un capro espiatorio
si fa avanti, un nuovo incontro ci sorprende e gli appoggi sicuri che avevamo
si dissolvono sotto i nostri piedi lasciandoci in balia di un’insicurezza
eterna. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Questo è per noi il fulcro dello </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">spettacolo</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> e il
punto da cui è partita la nostra ricerca. </span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Il nostro obiettivo è quello di alimentare e far crescere questa insicurezza nel pubblico. Far sì che esca dal
teatro con una domanda concreta: <b>con chi schierarsi? </b>Una domanda a cui spesso
rispondiamo in fretta, d’istinto, ma che, se analizzata davvero, è molto più
complessa di quanto crediamo: <b>dovrei schierarmi dalla parte di chi combatte la
violenza del potere o dalla parte del Potere che combatte i violenti?</b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p>Ci troviamo di fronte a tematiche estremamente attuali
benché appartengano al periodo a cavallo tra ‘800 e ‘900. Si parla di <b>diritti</b> o
meglio della loro <b>assenza</b>. In primis del diritto al <b>lavoro</b>, di come la sua
assenza porti alla perdita della <b>dignità</b> e di come l’assenza della dignità
porti le persone a commettere <b>atti estremi </b>nel tentativo di guadagnarne una. Si
parla del <b>desiderio</b> di uno stato giusto che garantisca una <b>vita</b> decente, che
dia <b>voce</b> a tutti e agisca nella <b>legalità</b> e nella <b>trasparenza</b>, ma anche del
desiderio dello stato stesso e dei suoi funzionari di garantire una <b>sicurezza</b> e
una <b>protezione</b> ai suoi cittadini da coloro che spesso in nome di giustizie
sociali agiscono contro quella stessa società. Si parla della <b>negazione</b> della
<b>libertà</b> di parola e della scelta tra <b>utopia</b> e <b>realismo</b>. Ci si chiede cosa
scegliere tra “<b>ribellione</b>” e “<b>rivoluzione</b>” e ci si chiede quanto sottile sia il
<b>confine</b> tra <b>lotta</b> e <b>terrorismo</b>.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>E più il lavoro procede, più lo
spettacolo cresce, tanto più si palesa quanto tutto questo ci parli di oggi.</b> <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">E così continuiamo a lavorare e scoprire, cercando di non schierarci,
tentando di rimanere su quella delicata via di mezzo dove spesso si trova la
verità. Perché l’argomento è troppo grande, troppo attuale e tropo necessario
per fare di questo spettacolo solo il manifesto di un’idea. </span></p>

<h2>LE PERSONE: <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">i B o r g o b o n ó</span>
</h2>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Uno dei punti di forza del nostro lavoro sono le persone.</p>
<p><b>Tutti i membri dei Borgobonó sono professionisti, innamorati del loro lavoro e formati in alcune delle migliori scuole di teatro Europee:</b></p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>LAMDA – The London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art –<i> Londra</i>
</li>
<li>École Internationale de Théâtre Jacques Lecoq –<i> Parigi</i>
</li>
<li>Scuola d’Arte Drammatica “Paolo Grassi”– <i>Milano</i>
</li>
<li>Accademia Nazionale d’Arte Drammatica “Silvio d’Amico” – <i>Roma</i>
</li>
<li>Prima del teatro. Scuola Europea per l’Arte dell’Attore – <i>Pisa</i>
</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p>Crediamo fortemente che la diversità sia una fonte d’inesauribile ricchezza creativa e per questo abbiamo voluto portarla anche all’interno del nostro progetto facendo in modo che tutti i componenti del progetto venissero da formazioni differenti.</p>
<h2><br/></h2>
<div><br/></div>
<h2>LA MUSICA DI SCENA</h2>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Altro grande punto di forza del nostro spettacolo è la musica.</p>
<p><b>Tutti i brani di <i>In ogni caso nessun rimorso</i> sono suonati dal vivo e composti appositamente per lo spettacolo da Adele Pardi</b>, violoncellista, cantante, compositrice, vincitrice del primo premio al Festival Acustico di Trento, vincitrice del Premio Pavanello Giovani Cantautori 2012 e nondimeno parte integrante dei Borgobonó.</p>
<p>Adele lavora insieme a regista e attori, componendo durante le prove e completando il lavoro degli attori. La musica di <i>In ogni caso nessun rimorso</i> non è mai una colonna sonora ma è sempre attore in scena.</p>
</div>
<br/><br/><p></p>
<h2>MATERIALI  E  MOVIMENTO</h2>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Uno dei primi punti da chiarire è stato come avremmo dovuto usare lo spazio. <br/>La storia di <i>In ogni caso nessun rimorso</i> si sviluppa infatti tra Italia, Inghilterra, Belgio, e molte città della Francia, in un costante susseguirsi di cambi di scena. Inoltre sono costanti i cambi tra interno e esterno. Per questo avevamo bisogno di uno spazio che non raccontasse già di per sé una storia, ma che desse la possibilità al pubblico di seguirci, uno spazio che ci assecondasse e che fosse pronto a mutare completamente ogni qualvolta ne avessimo bisogno. La soluzione è stata utilizzare uno spazio vuoto. Grazie a questo, una parola, uno sguardo bastano a cambiare spazio e tempo. Inoltre in questo modo i rapporti umani vengono evidenziati ancora di più, dato che, in assenza di altro, sono proprio loro a creare il mondo che li circonda, il contesto, l’ambientazione.</p>
<p>A questo punto ci serviva qualcosa che rendesse concreto lo spazio. Due punti ci sembrava potessero essere evidenziati: il lavoro in fabbrica e la rivoluzione che comportò l’invenzione e la diffusione dell’automobile. Abbiamo scelto di usare pancali e ruote di bicicletta come unici materiali di scena. Sono materiali basici, legno e ferro, e danno subito una sensazione concreta del lavoro nelle acciaierie e delle abitazioni umili; sono capaci, data la loro forma “grezza”, di dare corpo a immagini diverse, grazie all’abilità del manipolatore e all’immaginazione dello spettatore.</p>
<p>Lo spettacolo si sviluppa così tra narrazione e scene, basandosi completamente sulla recitazione di quattro attori che continuano a scambiarsi i ruoli di narratori, personaggi e manipolatori di oggetti, mettendo in scena molti spazi differenti e un grande numero di personaggi.<span><br/></span><span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>               <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1054005/files/20141128113010-Sfondo_Borgobon_.jpg?1417203010"" src="""" style=""width: 510.22443890274315px; height: 330px;""/><br/></span></p>

<p>Bonjour!</p>
<p>Je m’appelle
Mauro Pasqualini, je fait partie de la Borgobonó Cie, je suis le metteur-en-scène
de la pièce <b><i>En Tous Cas Pas De Remords</i>
i</b>nspiré par le roman homonyme de Pino Cacucci et <b>je suis ici pour vous demander
de nous aider à compléter notre nouvelle, profonde, vitale et touchante pièce
de théâtre.</b></p>
<p>Avec <i>En tous cas pas de remords</i> nous voulons porter
sur le plateau l’ histoire de Victor Kibalchich, du commissaire Jouin, de Jules
Bonnot, de Rirette Maitrejean, de Raymond Callemin et beaucoup d’autres. Des
hommes et des femmes vraiment existés, qui ont eu des visions différentes de la
réalité, mais qui avaient tout à fait le même désir de vivre dans un monde
juste.</p>
<p>Mais quel est le
monde «juste»?<span><br/></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Selon certains
parmi eux est le monde où ils sont nés, selon des autres ce qu’il peut naitre
grâce à la révolution, selon d'autres encore ce qui n’existe pas et doit donc
être encore cherché.</span></p>
<p><i>En Tous Cas Pas De Remords</i> est une recherche, faite sans prendre
parti, sans prendre parti aucune, tout en restant restant sur cette ligne subtile
où la vérité se cache. Mais la vérité est-elle possible?<span><br/></span><span><br/></span></p>
<blockquote>  <i><b>Victor:</b> Commissaire Jouin la vraie raison
pour laquelle je ne peux pas trouver la paix dans cette vie, c’est que je
n’arrive jamais à voir les choses tout simplement. Si seulement je pouvais me
contenter des slogans faciles et des raisonnements élémentaires. Tout est si
sacrément complexe d'ajouter constamment doutes à douter. Il y a une seule chose
simple dans cette réalité que nous avons été obligés de vivre; Vous et moi,
nous sommes ennemis naturels.<br/></i><i>  <b>Commissaire Jouin:</b> Vous êtes libre de ne
pas me croire mais je ne me sens pas votre ennemi.<br/></i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">                                                       «En tous cas pas de remords » Pino
Cacucci</span>
</blockquote>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></p>
<p>Nous croyons tout
à fait que cette pièce de théâtre et ses histoires des gens qui ont vécu au
début du XX siècle - dans une époque qui est quelque part un miroir de notre
époque contemporain - ont la capacité de <b>parler directement à nous, à notre
présent d’aujourd'hui et bien sure aux spectateurs en salle.</b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p></p>
<h2>EN TOUS CAS PAS DE REMORDS</h2>
<p><span><br/></span>Au tournant du
1800 et 1900, en Europe et au-delà, un groupe de personnes défini par l'histoire
comme anarchistes - titre sous lequel ont été rassemblés tous ces qui n’étaient
pas en accord avec le statu quo - il se pose le problème de comment résoudre la
question de l'inégalité sociale et de comment améliorer la condition du
prolétariat. Certains ont choisi le chemin des médias, à travers les journaux,
les livres et les traités sur la philosophie; d'autres ont choisi d'attaquer le
pouvoir dans ce qu’il avait de plus cher: le Capitale. D'autres ont choisi les
deux chemins.</p>
<p>Protagonistes de <i>En tous cas pas de remords</i>: les flics, les
anarchistes, les philosophes, les prostituées, les politiciens, les
travailleurs et beaucoup d’autres.</p>
<p>Tous coupables.
Tous innocents. Toutes victimes. Tous bourreaux.</p>

<h2>A QUOI SERT VOTRE DONATION</h2>
<p><span><br/></span>Votre donation
nous permettra de compléter la Partie II de la pièce.<span><br/></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Ben oui, </span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">En tous cas pas de remords</i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> est une pièce
de théâtre divisée en deux parties et la Partie I a déjà fait son débuts à
Milan en Juin 2014 où elle a gagné un très grand succès. Mais seule est
incomplète. C’est la raison car nous vous demandons de nous aider.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span></span></p>
<p><b>Nous avons besoin
de € 6000 pour compléter notre spectacle.<span><br/></span></b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p>Ce est le chiffre
dont nous avons besoin pour couvrir les dépenses liées aux frais de production.</p>
<p>6000 Euros
seulement de remboursements, rien d'autre: <b>dans cette figure il n’est pas prévu
aucun paiement pour les personnes impliquées.</b></p>
<p>Ce que nous demandons
est de nous aider à amasser des fonds qui nous permettront de soutenir les
frais de subsistance pendant la création. Nous croyons fermement que notre
pièce, une fois terminée, sera bien capable de marcher avec ses jambes et nous
remboursera pour tout le travail effectué.</p>
<p>La durée de la
préparation sera environ de <b>2 mois de travail</b> divisés en trois périodes entre
Janvier et Avril 2015, et comprend la participation de trois acteurs, un
musicien, une chorégraphe des mouvements scéniques et un metteur-en-scène, pour
un total de <b>6 personnes</b>.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><u>Dedans les les € 6000 que nous vous demandons d'aider à collecter il y a:</u></p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">€ 1000 - Voyage:</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">
Nous habitons dans quatre régions italiennes différentes, et cela nous demande de
soutenir des coûts importants pour travailler ensemble. Pour ce qui concerne la
salle de répétition, nous profitons de résidences artistiques dans plusieurs
théâtres italiens: cela nous permet d'éviter les coûts de location pour
l'espace, mais il nous oblige à un périodique et coûteux mouvement de
l'ensemble des gens et de la scénographie à travers l'Italie .</span>
</li></ul>
<ul><li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>€ 1500 - Conseil:</b>
Nous avons prévu des courses communautaires pour minimiser les coûts lié aux
repas. Nous l’avons réduit au minimum, mais nous nous sommes engagés à prendre
une bouteille de vin pour porter un toast à notre travail et à tous ceux qui le
soutiennent!</span></li></ul>

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>€ 3500 - Loyer:</b>

que la spécificité et les soins sont à la base d’un travail de qualité.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span></span>

vraiment dans notre travail et dans sa qualité et cela nous permettra

<p></p>
<h2><b>SUJETS: ""Quoi faire?""</b></h2>
<p><br/></p>
<p><i>Quelle est la chose
juste à faire?</i></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Qu’il ne s’est jamais posé cette question ? Combien
de fois, au moment de prendre une décision importante, pendant que le monde
autour nous serre et que le temps nous presse, la peur de donner une mauvaise
réponse à cette question nous fait hésiter et nous bloque en nous forçant à baisser
la tête et à accepter la vie tel qu’elle est ? La réponse de Jules, Jouin,
Platano, Rirette, Victor et de tous les personnages de ce spectacle – tous
ayant réellement vécu – est une seule et elle est chorale : </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">n’hésitez pas,
osez, faites, car ainsi personne un jour ne viendra nous accuser de pas avoir
au moins essayé.</b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p>Tous les personnages de ce
spectacle essayent. Ils essayent de changer le monde entier et de le rendre
plus juste, equilibré ; ils essayent respectivement de mettre de l’ordre
ou de rendre la nation plus sûre ; ils essayent de gérer au mieux leur
enterprise et leur Pays ; ils essayent de favoriser tant que faire se
pourra l’épanuissement d’un amour, d’un fils ou plus simplement ils essayent de
crèer, au moins pour eux-même, une vie meilleure. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Mais la vie, telle qu’elle est, ne donne pas que des
solutions claires, elle offre de nombreuses nuances et dégradés: au cri
« les patrons sont tous des porcs » la vie répond par un patron comme
Dupré traitant son chauffer avec respect et amitié ; au slogan « les
subversifs sont tous violents » elle oppose des penseurs accomplis comme
Victor Kibalcic ; à la conviction « les policiers sont tous des conards» la
vie oppose l’acharné </span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">chercheur du vrai</i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">
qu’est le commissaire Jouin.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span></span></p>
<p>C’est ici qu’émerge l’âme de ce croisement de
vies. Car à chaque fois qu’une solution facile se présente, rassurante, telle
l’idée d’un ennemi à combattre ou la possibilité d’un bouc émissaire, une
nouvelle rencontre nous surprend et les appuis solides  préétablis s’évanouissent sous nos pieds, nous
laissant victimes d’une insécurité éternelle. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Là est pour nous le centre de notre pièce et c’est
aussi là qu’est le point de départ de notre recherche.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span></span></p>
<p>Notre bout est
de nourrir et grandir cette insécurité dedans le public.Nous voulons qu’ils sortent du théâtre munis d’une
question concrète : <b>avec qui se ranger?</b> Une question à laquelle
souvent nous répondons trop vite, d’une façon instinctive, mais qui, si nous
l’analysons vraiment bien, est beaucoup plus complexe que ce que nous pourrions
croire: <b>est-ce que je devrais me ranger du côté de ceux qui se battent
contre la violence du pouvoir ou avec le Pouvoir qui se bat contre les   violentes ? </b></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Nous sommes mis face à des thématiques tout à fait
actuelles bien qu’elles soient liées a la période d’entre la fin du XIXème et
du début du XXème siècle. On parle de <b>droits</b> ou mieux, de leur <b>absence</b>.
Première chose on parle du droit au <b>travail</b>, de son absence qui amène à la
perte de <b>dignité</b> et du fait que cet absence de dignité amène les gens à
commettre des <b>actions extrême</b> tout en essayant par la même de regagner ladite dignité.
On parle du <b>désir</b> d’un Etat juste, garant d’une <b>vie</b> digne, capable de donner la
<b>voix</b> à tout le monde et agissant de façon <b>légale</b> et <b>transparente</b>, et dans le
même temps il est question d’un désir de l’Etat, pour lui-même, et de ses
fonctionnaires en tant que garants de l’<b>assurance</b> d’un bien être de ses
citoyennes contre des gens qui, pour des raisonnes de justice sociale, agissent
contre l’Etat même. On parle de la <b>négation</b> de la <b>liberté</b> de parole et du choix
entre <b>utopie</b> et <b>réalisme</b>. On se demande ce qu’il voudrait mieux choisir entre
« <b>rébellion</b> » et «<b>révolution</b>» 
et on questionne la si subtile limite entre <b>lutte</b> et <b>terrorisme</b>.</p>
<p><b>Au fur et à mesure que notre travail progresse et que le spectacle grandit,
plus nous découvrons que tout cela nous parle d’aujourd’hui.</b> Cela établit, nous
continuons à travailler et à découvrir – essayant de pas nous ranger, essayant
de rester sur la frontière fragile où souvent se trouve la vérité. Car la
matière est trop grande, trop actuelle et trop nécessaire pour faire de ce
spectacle le simple manifeste d’une idée.</p>

<br/><p></p>
<p>Un des points
forts de notre travail sont les gens.</p>

<p>Nous croyons tout
à fait que la diversité soit une source de richesse inépuisable pour nourrir et
alimenter la créativité et c’est pour cette raison que nous l’avons voulue
amener meme au sein de notre projet en faisant en sorte que toutes les
composantes du projet sont venus de différentes formations.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h2>MUSIQUE</h2>
<h2>           </h2>
<p>Un autre point fort de notre spectacle est la musique.                                         <br/></p>
<p><b>Toutes les
chansons de <i>En tous cas pas de remords</i>
sont joués en direct et composée spécialement pour notre spectacle par Adele
Pardi</b>, violoncelliste, chanteur, compositeur, gagnante du premier prix au
Festival acoustique de Trento, gagnante du prix Pavanello Giovani Cantautori
2012 et pourtant partie intégrante des Borgobonó.</p>
<p>Adèle travaille
avec le réalisateur et les acteurs, composer pendant les essais et en
complétant le travail des acteurs. La musique de Dans tous les cas, aucun
regret ne est jamais une bande-son, mais ce est toujours un acteur sur scène.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h2>MATÉRIAUX ET MOUVEMENT</h2>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Le premier point à élucider
était l’utilisation que nous aurions à faire de l’espace. L’histoire de <i>En tout cas, pas de remords</i> se développe
en fait entre France, Italie, Angleterre et Belgique, dans un changement
perpétuel des lieux de scène. De plus, de nombreuses scènes sont des
« intérieurs » qui alternent immédiatement avec les  « extérieurs ». Pour cette raison,
nous avions besoin d’un espace qu’il ne fut pas fixe mais qu’il offrirait la
possibilité au public de nous suivre sans rester fixé dans un seul lieu et
histoire : un espace malléable et prêt à changer tout à fait chaque fois
que nous en avions eu besoin. La solution a été d’utiliser un espace vide.
Grace à cet espace, un mot e un regard suffisent à changer l’espace  et le temps. Ce qui d’ailleurs souligne mieux
les rapports humaines, comme il n’y a rien d’autre : ce sont eux – les
rapports entre les personnes – qui créent le monde autour, le contexte,
l’ambiance. </p>
<p>Arrivé à ce point-là du travail, nous éprouvions
le besoin de quelque chose pour rendre l’espace concret. Deux choses nous ont
semblé pouvoir être signifiées : le travail dans les usines et la
révolution que la diffusion de l’automobile a provoqué. Nous avons choisi
d’utiliser des <i>pallets </i>et des roues
de vélo comme seules matériaux scéniques. Ils sont des matériaux basiques –
bois et fer – et ils donnent immédiatement la sensation concret du travail en
scierie et des maisons des gens humbles ; ils sont capables – car leur
forme est « brute » – de donner corps à plusieurs images différents
grâce à l’habilité du manipulateur secondée par l’imagination du public.</p>
<p>Le spectacle se développe entre
narration et scènes dialoguées. Les comédiens sur scène seront quatre et ils

What is the world that you would like?



                                     Inspired by the novel ""In Any Case No Remorse"" by Pino Cacucci.
                                                                                                                          Based on true stories.
                                                    ______________________

Hello!I am Mauro Pasqualini, a member of the company Borgobonó and director of the play In Any Case No Remorse, based on the eponymous novel by Pino Cacucci, and I'm here to ask for your help in mounting our new, deep, lively and moving show.



With In Any Case No Remorse we want to bring to life the history of Victor Kibalchich, Commissioner Jouin, Jules Bonnot, Rirette Maitrejean, Raymond Callemin and many others. Real men and women who existed, with different visions of reality, but all sharing the desire to live in a world that is Right.
But what is this ""Right"" world?For some of them it’s the one into which they were born, for others it’s the one that comes after a revolution, and for still others it does not yet exist and must be forged anew.
In Any Case No Remorse is an investigation, made without taking sides, walking the fine line between what seems true and what is true. But is a singular “truth” real? What does it mean to be “true”?
 Victor: Commissioner Jouin, the real reason I cannot find peace in this life is that I can never see things simply. I wish I could be content with some easy slogans of elementary reasoning. Everything is so darn complex, constantly adding to doubts to doubts. There is but one simple thing in this reality in which we’re forced to live; you and I are natural enemies.

 Commissioner Jouin: You are free not to believe me, but I do not believe myself to be your enemy.

                                       from ""In Any Case, No Remorse"" by Pino Cacucci

We deeply believe that this show and these stories – of people who lived at the beginning of 1900’s, an era that is in a way a mirror to our own – have the ability to speak directly to our present-day audiences.


IN ANY CASE NO REMORSE
At the turn of the XX century in Europe and beyond, a group of persons defined by history as anarchists - a title under which gathered anyone who stood outside the status quo - confronted the problems of social inequality and the struggle of the proletariat. Some chose the path of media, through newspapers, books and treatises on philosophy; others chose to attack what those in power held most dear: the Capital. Still others chose both.
Protagonists of In Any Case No Remorse: policemen, anarchists, philosophers, prostitutes, politicians, workers and many others.
All guilty. All innocent. All victims. All executioners.

                                                         



WHAT YOUR DONATION DOES

Your donation will allow us to complete the Part II of the show.Yes, In Any Case No Remorse is a show in two parts, and Part I debuted in Milan in June 2014 to great acclaim. But on its own it’s incomplete. That's why we’re asking you to help us.
We need € 6,000 to complete our show.

The estimated prep time is 2 months, divided into 3 periods between January and April 2015, and includes the participation of 3 actors, 1 musician, 1 movement curator, and 1 director, for a total of 6 people.
The funds will cover expenses during construction and rehearsal, not salaries. We believe strongly that this show, when finished, will walk with his own legs and will repay us for all the work done.



The € 6000 breaks down as follows:


€ 1,000 - Travel: We come from four different regions in Italy, and this in itself incurs substantial costs for working together. We are taking advantage of artistic residencies in several Italian theaters: this allows us to avoid the expense of rehearsal rent, but it still requires a periodic and costly moving of the set through Italy.


€ 1500 - Food: We have budgeted for communal grocery shopping to minimize costs. It is minimal, but we are committed to having one bottle of wine to toast our work and all those who are supporting us!


€ 3,500 - Rent: All players in this project have given up other jobs to devote their full time to In Any Case No Remorse. We believe that specificity and care are the basis for quality work.

And if you are unable to reach € 6,000?We believe in our work and in its quality, and that this will allow us to reach the IndieGogo goal we have set. But if we don’t, even a fraction of the amount would be of great help to us as we carry on with the show.
In Any Case No Remorse has already rehearsed more than 100 days in 8 different artistic residencies:
TRA - Rossi Open Theatre (Pisa)Center Palmetta (Terni)Space Compost (Prato)Theater of Anghiari (Arezzo)Armunia (Castiglioncello)Era Theatre (Pontedera)The Slaughterhouses (Certaldo)The City Theatre (Farm)
We are making the theater we love, which requires time and care, the theater in which we believe, and we hope that you will help us realize it.We cannot wait to share it with you.

THEMES: “What's right to do?”

“What is the right thing to do?”

Who has never asked this question? How many times have you, when faced with an important decision, felt the world’s weight and time’s shrinkage, the fear of the wrong choice making you hesitate, forcing you to bow your head and accept life simply as it is?
The response of Jules, Jouin, Platano, Rirette, Victor and all the characters of this show - all real people – is one, cried in unison: Do not hesitate but do it, so that no one will never have the opportunity to recriminate that you hadn't at least tried.
All the characters in this show try. They try to change the world and make it fairer, try to bring order and make the nation safe, try to shore up their company or their country, try to grow their love, their children. Simply, they try to create a better life for themselves. But life, being life, does not offer solutions, only nuances and complications: the scream of, ""The bosses are all Pigs!” falls on a boss like Dupre, who treats his driver with respect and friendship; the slogan ""the subversives are all violent "" is countered by fine thinkers as Victor Kibalchich; and the belief ""the cops are all bastards"" comes up against a researcher of the truth, Commissioner Jouin.
And it is here, at this intersection of ideals and real lives, that we find the soul of the piece. Because every time an easy, reassuring solution comes forward, as the idea of an enemy to be defeated or the possibility of a scapegoat to take blame, a new encounter surprises us, and the solid supports we had dissolve under our feet, leaving us at the mercy of an eternal insecurity. This is for us the focus of the show and the point from which our research grew.
Our goal is to feed and nurture this uncertainty in the public, so that the audience leaves the theater with a concrete question: whose side would you take? A question that we often answer quickly, instinctively, but which, if really analysed, is much more complex: should I take the side of those who fight the violence  of the power , or the side of the Power that fights the violent? 
The piece addresses contemporary issues, even though they play out at the turn of the 20th century. We talk of rights, and of their lack. Primarily the right to work, of how its absence leads to the loss of dignity and how the lack of dignity leads people to commit extreme acts in an attempt to earn one. We speak of the desire for a just state that guarantees a decent life, that gives voice to all and acts  in legality and transparency,  but also about the desire of the state itself and of it's  officials of ensuring safety and a protection to its citizens from those that frequently, in the name of social justice, act against that same society. We talk about the denial of freedom of speech and the choice between utopia and realism. We question ourselves about the difference between ""rebellion"" and ""revolution,"" and we ask ourselves how thin the line between fight and terrorism is.
And the more the work progresses, the more the show grows, the more it reveals how all this speaks to us about today. And so we continue to work and discover, trying not to take sides, trying to stay on that delicate middle ground where we often find the truth. The themes of this piece are too big, too present and too vital to relegate to a mere manifesto of an idea.
                             

PEOPLE: the B o r g o b o n ó


The keystone of our work is the people.
All members of Borgobonó are professionals in love with their work, and have trained in some of the best theater schools in Europea:

LAMDA - The London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art - London

École Internationale de Théâtre Jacques Lecoq - Paris

School of Dramatic Art ""Paolo Grassi"" - Milan

National Academy of Dramatic Art ""Silvio d'Amico"" - Rome

Prima del teatro. European School for the Art of the actor – Pisa




We strongly believe that diversity is an inexhaustible source of  creativity, and we wanted it to be one of the main charatteristics of our  project. For this reason all  the components come from different schools and theaters .


MUSIC SCENE

Another key strength of our show is the music.
All songs of In Any Case No Remorse are played live and composed for the show by Adele Pardi, cellist, singer, composer, winner of the first prize in the Acoustic Festival of Trento, Prize winner Pavanello Young Songwriter 2012, and an integral part of Borgobonó.
Adele works with the director and actors, composing during the rehearsals and complementing the work onstage. The music of In Any Case No Regret is never a soundtrack, but rather another character with a story of its own.



MATERIALS AND MOVEMENT

One of the first points to be clarified was how we used the stage.The story of In Any Case No Remorse unfolds between Italy, England, Belgium, and many cities of France, in a constant succession of scene changes, indoors and out. For this reason we needed a space that would tell its own story, but that would allow the audience to follow us; a space that would be ready to change with us as we go. The solution was a blank stage. Thanks to this, a mere word or glance is enough to change space and time. It highlights the human relationships: in the absence of any other setting, they are the ones creating the world around themselves.
At this point we needed something to make the space concrete.
Two points we felt could be highlighted: factory work, and the revolution that involved the invention and spread of cars. We chose to use pallets and bicycle wheels as the only props. They are basic materials, wood and iron, and evoke a feeling of concrete work in the steel mills and humble housing; they are capable, given their form, ""crude"", and able to give substance to different images, thanks to the ability of the manipulator and the imagination of the viewer. 
The show thus develops, relying entirely on the four actors who continue to exchange the roles of narrators, characters and manipulators of objects, crafting many locations and many different people.

Pino Cacucci.
                                                                                                                            Tratto da storie vere.


                                                    _______________________



Ciao! 
Sono Mauro Pasqualini, membro della compagnia Borgobonó e regista dello spettacolo teatrale In Ogni Caso Nessun Rimorso ispirato all'omonimo romanzo di Pino Cacucci e sono qui per chiederti un aiuto per completare il nostro nuovo, profondo, vivo e toccante spettacolo.

Con In Ogni Caso Nessun Rimorso vogliamo portare in teatro la storia di Victor Kibalcic, del commissario Jouin, di Jules Bonnot, di Rirette Maîtrejean, di Raymond Callemin e di molti altri ancora. Uomini e donne realmente esistiti, con visioni differenti della realtà, ma tutti accomunati dal desiderio di vivere in un mondo giusto.
Ma qual'è il mondo ""giusto""?Per alcuni di loro è quello in cui sono nati, per altri quello che può venire dalla rivoluzione, per altri ancora quello che non esiste e va cercato.


In Ogni Caso Nessun Rimorso è una ricerca, fatta senza schierarsi, senza prendere le parti di nessuno, rimanendo su quella sottile linea dove si nasconde la verità. Ma una sola verità è possibile?



Victor: Commissario Jouin il vero motivo per cui non trovo pace in questa vita
è che non riesco mai a vedere le cose semplicemente. Magari potessi
accontentarmi di certe facili parole d’ordine di ragionamenti elementari. Tutto
è così maledettamente complesso da aggiungere costantemente dubbi a dubbi. C’è
una sola cosa semplice in questa realtà che ci hanno costretti a vivere; lei e
io siamo nemici naturali.


Commissario Jouin: E’ libero di non credermi ma io non mi sento
suo nemico.                                             da ""In ogni caso nessun rimorso"" di Pino Cacucci



Crediamo profondamente che questo spettacolo e queste storie di persone vissute a inizio '900, in un epoca che è a suo modo specchio di quella contemporanea, abbiano la capacità di parlare in modo diretto del nostro presente agli spettatori di oggi.




IN OGNI CASO NESSUN RIMORSO
A cavallo tra ‘800 e ‘900,
in Europa e non solo, un gruppo di persone definite dalla storia come anarchici
– sotto il cui titolo veniva raggruppato tutto ciò che non era in accordo con
lo status quo – si pose il problema
di come risolvere la disuguaglianza sociale e migliorare la condizione del
proletariato. Alcuni scelsero la via mediatica attraverso giornali, libri e
trattati di filosofia; altri scelsero di attaccare il potere in ciò che gli era
più caro: il Capitale. Altri le scelsero entrambe.

Protagonisti di In ogni caso nessun rimorso: poliziotti, anarchici,
filosofi, prostitute, politici, operai e molti altri ancora. 
Tutti colpevoli. Tutti
innocenti. Tutti vittime. Tutti carnefici.


                                                          


COSA FA LA TUA DONAZIONE



La tua donazione ci permetterà di completare la Parte II dello spettacolo.

Già, In Ogni Caso Nessun Rimorso è uno
spettacolo diviso in due parti e la Parte
I  ha già debuttato a Milano a Giugno 2014 riscuotendo davvero un ottimo successo. Ma da sola è incompleta. Ecco perché ti chiediamo
di aiutarci.

Abbiamo
bisogno di 6.000€ per completare il nostro spettacolo.

Questa
è la cifra di cui abbiamo bisogno per coprire le spese legate all’allestimento.

6.000
euro di soli rimborsi,niente altro: in questa cifra non è previsto alcun tipo di pagamento per le persone coinvolte.

Quello che ti chiediamo è di aiutarci a raccogliere i fondi che ci permetteranno di sostenere le spese
vive durante l’allestimento. Crediamo infatti fermamente che questo spettacolo,
una volta terminato, camminerà con le sue gambe e potrà ripagarci per tutto il
lavoro fatto.
Il
periodo stimato per l’allestimento è
di 2 mesi di lavoro suddivisi in 3 periodi
tra Gennaio e Aprile 2015 e prevede la partecipazione di 3 attori, 1 musicista,
1 curatrice dei movimenti scenici e 1 regista, per un totale di 6 persone.  

Nei 6000 € che vi stiamo chiedendo di sostenere sono
compresi:


1000 €
- Viaggi:   Veniamo da 4 regioni italiane differenti e
questo comporta di per sé notevoli costi per lavorare insieme. Inoltre, per
quanto riguarda la sala-prove, stiamo usufruendo di residenze artistiche in
diversi teatri italiani: questo ci permette di non dover sostenere costi di
affitto per lo spazio, ma ci obbliga comunque a un periodico e costoso trasloco
della scenografia attraverso l’Italia.


1500 €
- Vitto:   Abbiamo
preventivato una spesa alimentare comunitaria per ridurre al minimo i costi. E’
minima ma ci impegniamo a prendere una bottiglia di vino per brindare al nostro
lavoro e a tutti quelli che lo stanno sostenendo!


3500 €
- Affitto:   Tutti i componenti di questo progetto hanno
rinunciato ad altri lavori per poter dedicare a pieno il loro tempo
all’allestimento di In ogni Caso Nessun Rimorso. Siamo convinti che la
specificità e la cura siano la base per un lavoro di qualità. 





E nel caso non doveste raggiungere i 6000€?

Crediamo davvero nel nostro lavoro e nella sua qualità e che questa ci permetterà di ottenere con questa campagna di crowdfounding l'obbiettivo che ci siamo prefissati. Ma anche se così non fosse, anche solo una parte di quella cifra sarebbe per noi di grande aiuto per portare avanti il nostro progetto. 


In ogni Caso Nessun Rimorso conta più di 100 giorni di prove già fatte in 8 differenti residenze artistiche: 



TRA – Teatro Rossi Aperto (Pisa)Centro di Palmetta (Terni)Spazio Compost (Prato)Teatro di Anghiari (Arezzo) Armunia (Castiglioncello) Teatro Era (Pontedera)I Macelli (Certaldo)La Città del
Teatro (Cascina).
Stiamo facendo il teatro che amiamo, quello che richiede tempo e cura; il teatro in cui crediamo e che speriamo voi vogliate aiutarci a realizzare.Noi non vediamo l'ora di poterlo condividere con voi.

TEMATICHE: ""Cosa è giusto fare?""




Qual’è la cosa giusta da fare?

Chi non si è mai
posto questa domanda? Quante volte nel momento di prendere una decisione
importante, mentre il mondo ci schiaccia e il tempo si restringe, la paura di
rispondere nel modo sbagliato a questa domanda ci fa esitare e ci blocca
costringendoci a chinare la testa e accettare la vita così come viene? La
risposta di Jules, Jouin, Platano, Rirette, Victor e tutti i personaggi di
questo spettacolo – tutti realmente esistiti - è una e all’unisono: non
esitare, fare, perché così in futuro nessuno ci potrà recriminare che non
abbiamo almeno tentato.

Tutti i personaggi
di questo spettacolo tentano. Tentano di cambiare il mondo e renderlo più equo,
tentano di portare l’ordine e rendere la nazione sicura, tentano di
amministrare al meglio la loro azienda o il loro paese, tentano di far crescere
al meglio il loro amore, i loro figli o più semplicemente tentano di creare
almeno per sé una vita migliore. Ma la vita, in quanto vita, non offre
soluzioni dirette, solo una infinità di sfumature e complicazioni: all’urlo ""I padroni sono tutti dei porci” risponde con padroni come Dupré che trattano il
loro autista con rispetto e amicizia, allo slogan “I sovversivi sono tutti
violenti” contrappone fini pensatori come Victor Kibalcic,  e al credo “I poliziotti sono tutti bastardi”
mette davanti un fine ricercatore
della veritàcome il commissario
Jouin.

E’ qui che l‘anima che nasce da questo incrocio di
vite affiora. Perché tutte le volte che una soluzione facile, rassicurante,
come l’idea di un nemico da sconfiggere o la possibilità di un capro espiatorio
si fa avanti, un nuovo incontro ci sorprende e gli appoggi sicuri che avevamo
si dissolvono sotto i nostri piedi lasciandoci in balia di un’insicurezza
eterna. Questo è per noi il fulcro dello spettacolo e il
punto da cui è partita la nostra ricerca. 

Il nostro obiettivo è quello di alimentare e far crescere questa insicurezza nel pubblico. Far sì che esca dal
teatro con una domanda concreta: con chi schierarsi? Una domanda a cui spesso
rispondiamo in fretta, d’istinto, ma che, se analizzata davvero, è molto più
complessa di quanto crediamo: dovrei schierarmi dalla parte di chi combatte la
violenza del potere o dalla parte del Potere che combatte i violenti?

Ci troviamo di fronte a tematiche estremamente attuali
benché appartengano al periodo a cavallo tra ‘800 e ‘900. Si parla di diritti o
meglio della loro assenza. In primis del diritto al lavoro, di come la sua
assenza porti alla perdita della dignità e di come l’assenza della dignità
porti le persone a commettere atti estremi nel tentativo di guadagnarne una. Si
parla del desiderio di uno stato giusto che garantisca una vita decente, che
dia voce a tutti e agisca nella legalità e nella trasparenza, ma anche del
desiderio dello stato stesso e dei suoi funzionari di garantire una sicurezza e
una protezione ai suoi cittadini da coloro che spesso in nome di giustizie
sociali agiscono contro quella stessa società. Si parla della negazione della
libertà di parola e della scelta tra utopia e realismo. Ci si chiede cosa
scegliere tra “ribellione” e “rivoluzione” e ci si chiede quanto sottile sia il
confine tra lotta e terrorismo.

E più il lavoro procede, più lo
spettacolo cresce, tanto più si palesa quanto tutto questo ci parli di oggi. E così continuiamo a lavorare e scoprire, cercando di non schierarci,
tentando di rimanere su quella delicata via di mezzo dove spesso si trova la
verità. Perché l’argomento è troppo grande, troppo attuale e tropo necessario
per fare di questo spettacolo solo il manifesto di un’idea. 

                             







LE PERSONE: i B o r g o b o n ó


Uno dei punti di forza del nostro lavoro sono le persone.
Tutti i membri dei Borgobonó sono professionisti, innamorati del loro lavoro e formati in alcune delle migliori scuole di teatro Europee:


LAMDA – The London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art – Londra

École Internationale de Théâtre Jacques Lecoq – Parigi

Scuola d’Arte Drammatica “Paolo Grassi”– Milano

Accademia Nazionale d’Arte Drammatica “Silvio d’Amico” – Roma

Prima del teatro. Scuola Europea per l’Arte dell’Attore – Pisa



Crediamo fortemente che la diversità sia una fonte d’inesauribile ricchezza creativa e per questo abbiamo voluto portarla anche all’interno del nostro progetto facendo in modo che tutti i componenti del progetto venissero da formazioni differenti.


LA MUSICA DI SCENA

Altro grande punto di forza del nostro spettacolo è la musica.
Tutti i brani di In ogni caso nessun rimorso sono suonati dal vivo e composti appositamente per lo spettacolo da Adele Pardi, violoncellista, cantante, compositrice, vincitrice del primo premio al Festival Acustico di Trento, vincitrice del Premio Pavanello Giovani Cantautori 2012 e nondimeno parte integrante dei Borgobonó.
Adele lavora insieme a regista e attori, componendo durante le prove e completando il lavoro degli attori. La musica di In ogni caso nessun rimorso non è mai una colonna sonora ma è sempre attore in scena.


MATERIALI  E  MOVIMENTO


Uno dei primi punti da chiarire è stato come avremmo dovuto usare lo spazio. La storia di In ogni caso nessun rimorso si sviluppa infatti tra Italia, Inghilterra, Belgio, e molte città della Francia, in un costante susseguirsi di cambi di scena. Inoltre sono costanti i cambi tra interno e esterno. Per questo avevamo bisogno di uno spazio che non raccontasse già di per sé una storia, ma che desse la possibilità al pubblico di seguirci, uno spazio che ci assecondasse e che fosse pronto a mutare completamente ogni qualvolta ne avessimo bisogno. La soluzione è stata utilizzare uno spazio vuoto. Grazie a questo, una parola, uno sguardo bastano a cambiare spazio e tempo. Inoltre in questo modo i rapporti umani vengono evidenziati ancora di più, dato che, in assenza di altro, sono proprio loro a creare il mondo che li circonda, il contesto, l’ambientazione.
A questo punto ci serviva qualcosa che rendesse concreto lo spazio. Due punti ci sembrava potessero essere evidenziati: il lavoro in fabbrica e la rivoluzione che comportò l’invenzione e la diffusione dell’automobile. Abbiamo scelto di usare pancali e ruote di bicicletta come unici materiali di scena. Sono materiali basici, legno e ferro, e danno subito una sensazione concreta del lavoro nelle acciaierie e delle abitazioni umili; sono capaci, data la loro forma “grezza”, di dare corpo a immagini diverse, grazie all’abilità del manipolatore e all’immaginazione dello spettatore.
Lo spettacolo si sviluppa così tra narrazione e scene, basandosi completamente sulla recitazione di quattro attori che continuano a scambiarsi i ruoli di narratori, personaggi e manipolatori di oggetti, mettendo in scena molti spazi differenti e un grande numero di personaggi.

inspiré par le roman homonyme de Pino Cacucci et je suis ici pour vous demander
de nous aider à compléter notre nouvelle, profonde, vitale et touchante pièce
de théâtre.
Avec En tous cas pas de remords nous voulons porter
sur le plateau l’ histoire de Victor Kibalchich, du commissaire Jouin, de Jules
Bonnot, de Rirette Maitrejean, de Raymond Callemin et beaucoup d’autres. Des
hommes et des femmes vraiment existés, qui ont eu des visions différentes de la
réalité, mais qui avaient tout à fait le même désir de vivre dans un monde
juste.
Mais quel est le
monde «juste»?Selon certains
parmi eux est le monde où ils sont nés, selon des autres ce qu’il peut naitre
grâce à la révolution, selon d'autres encore ce qui n’existe pas et doit donc
être encore cherché.
En Tous Cas Pas De Remords est une recherche, faite sans prendre
parti, sans prendre parti aucune, tout en restant restant sur cette ligne subtile
où la vérité se cache. Mais la vérité est-elle possible?
  Victor: Commissaire Jouin la vraie raison
pour laquelle je ne peux pas trouver la paix dans cette vie, c’est que je
n’arrive jamais à voir les choses tout simplement. Si seulement je pouvais me
contenter des slogans faciles et des raisonnements élémentaires. Tout est si
sacrément complexe d'ajouter constamment doutes à douter. Il y a une seule chose
simple dans cette réalité que nous avons été obligés de vivre; Vous et moi,
nous sommes ennemis naturels.  Commissaire Jouin: Vous êtes libre de ne
pas me croire mais je ne me sens pas votre ennemi.                                                       «En tous cas pas de remords » Pino
Cacucci


Nous croyons tout
à fait que cette pièce de théâtre et ses histoires des gens qui ont vécu au
début du XX siècle - dans une époque qui est quelque part un miroir de notre
époque contemporain - ont la capacité de parler directement à nous, à notre
présent d’aujourd'hui et bien sure aux spectateurs en salle.




EN TOUS CAS PAS DE REMORDS
Au tournant du
1800 et 1900, en Europe et au-delà, un groupe de personnes défini par l'histoire
comme anarchistes - titre sous lequel ont été rassemblés tous ces qui n’étaient
pas en accord avec le statu quo - il se pose le problème de comment résoudre la
question de l'inégalité sociale et de comment améliorer la condition du
prolétariat. Certains ont choisi le chemin des médias, à travers les journaux,
les livres et les traités sur la philosophie; d'autres ont choisi d'attaquer le
pouvoir dans ce qu’il avait de plus cher: le Capitale. D'autres ont choisi les
deux chemins.
Protagonistes de En tous cas pas de remords: les flics, les
anarchistes, les philosophes, les prostituées, les politiciens, les
travailleurs et beaucoup d’autres.
Tous coupables.
Tous innocents. Toutes victimes. Tous bourreaux.



                                                         



A QUOI SERT VOTRE DONATION
Votre donation
nous permettra de compléter la Partie II de la pièce.Ben oui, En tous cas pas de remords est une pièce
de théâtre divisée en deux parties et la Partie I a déjà fait son débuts à
Milan en Juin 2014 où elle a gagné un très grand succès. Mais seule est
incomplète. C’est la raison car nous vous demandons de nous aider.
Nous avons besoin
de € 6000 pour compléter notre spectacle.

Ce est le chiffre
dont nous avons besoin pour couvrir les dépenses liées aux frais de production.
6000 Euros
seulement de remboursements, rien d'autre: dans cette figure il n’est pas prévu
aucun paiement pour les personnes impliquées.
Ce que nous demandons
est de nous aider à amasser des fonds qui nous permettront de soutenir les
frais de subsistance pendant la création. Nous croyons fermement que notre
pièce, une fois terminée, sera bien capable de marcher avec ses jambes et nous
remboursera pour tout le travail effectué.
La durée de la
préparation sera environ de 2 mois de travail divisés en trois périodes entre
Janvier et Avril 2015, et comprend la participation de trois acteurs, un
musicien, une chorégraphe des mouvements scéniques et un metteur-en-scène, pour
un total de 6 personnes.

Dedans les les € 6000 que nous vous demandons d'aider à collecter il y a:


€ 1000 - Voyage:
Nous habitons dans quatre régions italiennes différentes, et cela nous demande de
soutenir des coûts importants pour travailler ensemble. Pour ce qui concerne la
salle de répétition, nous profitons de résidences artistiques dans plusieurs
théâtres italiens: cela nous permet d'éviter les coûts de location pour
l'espace, mais il nous oblige à un périodique et coûteux mouvement de
l'ensemble des gens et de la scénographie à travers l'Italie .

€ 1500 - Conseil:
Nous avons prévu des courses communautaires pour minimiser les coûts lié aux
repas. Nous l’avons réduit au minimum, mais nous nous sommes engagés à prendre
une bouteille de vin pour porter un toast à notre travail et à tous ceux qui le
soutiennent!

€ 3500 - Loyer:
Tous les composants de ce projet ont renoncé à d'autres emplois pour pouvoir  consacrer tout leur temps à la préparation de En tous cas pas de remords. Nous croyons
que la spécificité et les soins sont à la base d’un travail de qualité.

Et si vous ne
pouvez pas atteindre € 6000?Nous croyons
vraiment dans notre travail et dans sa qualité et cela nous permettra
d'atteindre avec cette campagne crowdfounding l’objectif que nous nous sommes
fixé. Mais s’il ne se passera pas comme ça, même une fraction de ce montant
serait une grande aide pour nous permettre de faire avancer notre projet.En tous cas pas de remords a déjà fait plus de 100 jours de répétitions
dans huit différentes théâtres et lieux de résidence:
TRA – Teatro
Rossi Aperto (Pise)Centro Palmetta
(Terni)Spazio Compost
(Prato)Teatro d'Anghiari
(Arezzo)Armunia
(Castiglioncello)Teatro Era
(Pontedera)I Macelli
(Certaldo)La Città del
Teatro (Cascina)
Nous sommes en
train de faire le théâtre qu’on aime, celui là qui exige du temps et des soins;
le théâtre dans lequel nous croyons et que nous espérons que vous souhaitez
nous aider à réaliser.Nous avons hâte
de le partager avec vous.

SUJETS: ""Quoi faire?""

Quelle est la chose
juste à faire?
Qu’il ne s’est jamais posé cette question ? Combien
de fois, au moment de prendre une décision importante, pendant que le monde
autour nous serre et que le temps nous presse, la peur de donner une mauvaise
réponse à cette question nous fait hésiter et nous bloque en nous forçant à baisser
la tête et à accepter la vie tel qu’elle est ? La réponse de Jules, Jouin,
Platano, Rirette, Victor et de tous les personnages de ce spectacle – tous
ayant réellement vécu – est une seule et elle est chorale : n’hésitez pas,
osez, faites, car ainsi personne un jour ne viendra nous accuser de pas avoir
au moins essayé.

Tous les personnages de ce
spectacle essayent. Ils essayent de changer le monde entier et de le rendre
plus juste, equilibré ; ils essayent respectivement de mettre de l’ordre
ou de rendre la nation plus sûre ; ils essayent de gérer au mieux leur
enterprise et leur Pays ; ils essayent de favoriser tant que faire se
pourra l’épanuissement d’un amour, d’un fils ou plus simplement ils essayent de
crèer, au moins pour eux-même, une vie meilleure. Mais la vie, telle qu’elle est, ne donne pas que des
solutions claires, elle offre de nombreuses nuances et dégradés: au cri
« les patrons sont tous des porcs » la vie répond par un patron comme
Dupré traitant son chauffer avec respect et amitié ; au slogan « les
subversifs sont tous violents » elle oppose des penseurs accomplis comme
Victor Kibalcic ; à la conviction « les policiers sont tous des conards» la
vie oppose l’acharné chercheur du vrai
qu’est le commissaire Jouin.
C’est ici qu’émerge l’âme de ce croisement de
vies. Car à chaque fois qu’une solution facile se présente, rassurante, telle
l’idée d’un ennemi à combattre ou la possibilité d’un bouc émissaire, une
nouvelle rencontre nous surprend et les appuis solides  préétablis s’évanouissent sous nos pieds, nous
laissant victimes d’une insécurité éternelle. Là est pour nous le centre de notre pièce et c’est
aussi là qu’est le point de départ de notre recherche.
Notre bout est
de nourrir et grandir cette insécurité dedans le public.Nous voulons qu’ils sortent du théâtre munis d’une
question concrète : avec qui se ranger? Une question à laquelle
souvent nous répondons trop vite, d’une façon instinctive, mais qui, si nous
l’analysons vraiment bien, est beaucoup plus complexe que ce que nous pourrions
croire: est-ce que je devrais me ranger du côté de ceux qui se battent
contre la violence du pouvoir ou avec le Pouvoir qui se bat contre les   violentes ? 

Nous sommes mis face à des thématiques tout à fait
actuelles bien qu’elles soient liées a la période d’entre la fin du XIXème et
du début du XXème siècle. On parle de droits ou mieux, de leur absence.
Première chose on parle du droit au travail, de son absence qui amène à la
perte de dignité et du fait que cet absence de dignité amène les gens à
commettre des actions extrême tout en essayant par la même de regagner ladite dignité.
On parle du désir d’un Etat juste, garant d’une vie digne, capable de donner la
voix à tout le monde et agissant de façon légale et transparente, et dans le
même temps il est question d’un désir de l’Etat, pour lui-même, et de ses
fonctionnaires en tant que garants de l’assurance d’un bien être de ses
citoyennes contre des gens qui, pour des raisonnes de justice sociale, agissent
contre l’Etat même. On parle de la négation de la liberté de parole et du choix
entre utopie et réalisme. On se demande ce qu’il voudrait mieux choisir entre
« rébellion » et «révolution» 
et on questionne la si subtile limite entre lutte et terrorisme.
Au fur et à mesure que notre travail progresse et que le spectacle grandit,
plus nous découvrons que tout cela nous parle d’aujourd’hui. Cela établit, nous
continuons à travailler et à découvrir – essayant de pas nous ranger, essayant
de rester sur la frontière fragile où souvent se trouve la vérité. Car la
matière est trop grande, trop actuelle et trop nécessaire pour faire de ce
spectacle le simple manifeste d’une idée.


                              



PERSONNES: B o r g o b o n ó


Un des points
forts de notre travail sont les gens.
Tous les personnes
qui font partie de Borgobonó Cie sont des professionnels du théâtre, passionnés
par leur travail et entrainés dans certaines parmi les meilleures écoles de
théâtre européen:

LAMDA - London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art - Londres
École Internationale
de Théâtre Jacques Lecoq - Paris
Scuola d’Arte
Drammatica ""Paolo Grassi"" - Milan
Accademia
Nazionale d’Arte Drammatica ""Silvio d'Amico"" - Rome
Prima del teatro.
European School for the Art of the Actor - Pise

Nous croyons tout
à fait que la diversité soit une source de richesse inépuisable pour nourrir et
alimenter la créativité et c’est pour cette raison que nous l’avons voulue
amener meme au sein de notre projet en faisant en sorte que toutes les
composantes du projet sont venus de différentes formations.



MUSIQUE
           
Un autre point fort de notre spectacle est la musique.                                         
Toutes les
chansons de En tous cas pas de remords
sont joués en direct et composée spécialement pour notre spectacle par Adele
Pardi, violoncelliste, chanteur, compositeur, gagnante du premier prix au
Festival acoustique de Trento, gagnante du prix Pavanello Giovani Cantautori
2012 et pourtant partie intégrante des Borgobonó.
Adèle travaille
avec le réalisateur et les acteurs, composer pendant les essais et en
complétant le travail des acteurs. La musique de Dans tous les cas, aucun
regret ne est jamais une bande-son, mais ce est toujours un acteur sur scène.



MATÉRIAUX ET MOUVEMENT

Le premier point à élucider
était l’utilisation que nous aurions à faire de l’espace. L’histoire de En tout cas, pas de remords se développe
en fait entre France, Italie, Angleterre et Belgique, dans un changement
perpétuel des lieux de scène. De plus, de nombreuses scènes sont des
« intérieurs » qui alternent immédiatement avec les  « extérieurs ». Pour cette raison,
nous avions besoin d’un espace qu’il ne fut pas fixe mais qu’il offrirait la
possibilité au public de nous suivre sans rester fixé dans un seul lieu et
histoire : un espace malléable et prêt à changer tout à fait chaque fois
que nous en avions eu besoin. La solution a été d’utiliser un espace vide.
Grace à cet espace, un mot e un regard suffisent à changer l’espace  et le temps. Ce qui d’ailleurs souligne mieux
les rapports humaines, comme il n’y a rien d’autre : ce sont eux – les
rapports entre les personnes – qui créent le monde autour, le contexte,
l’ambiance. 
Arrivé à ce point-là du travail, nous éprouvions
le besoin de quelque chose pour rendre l’espace concret. Deux choses nous ont
semblé pouvoir être signifiées : le travail dans les usines et la
révolution que la diffusion de l’automobile a provoqué. Nous avons choisi
d’utiliser des pallets et des roues
de vélo comme seules matériaux scéniques. Ils sont des matériaux basiques –
bois et fer – et ils donnent immédiatement la sensation concret du travail en
scierie et des maisons des gens humbles ; ils sont capables – car leur
forme est « brute » – de donner corps à plusieurs images différents
grâce à l’habilité du manipulateur secondée par l’imagination du public.
Le spectacle se développe entre
narration et scènes dialoguées. Les comédiens sur scène seront quatre et ils
changeront en permanence de rôle, passant de narrateurs à personnages et
manipulateurs d’objets, pour donner la vie à plusieurs figures, dans différents
espaces.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>  All That JAWS: A Sharktastic New Musical is written by Keenan Camp, Logan Dean and Chris Gorton. Directed by Keenan Camp. Produced by Erin Lane. Lifelong fans of the film, we decided to pay homage to it by recreating it for the stage with a lot of dark/silly humor and musical numbers thrown in. While you could classify it as a parody, we like to think of it as a love letter to one of the greatest films of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>A brief discription of the show:</p>
<p>When a gigantic, lonely, and misunderstood great white shark named Jaws comes to the small island community of Amity looking for friendship, his plans are thwarted by his baser instincts to eat everything and everyone around him.<br/> It's up to Martin Brody, a functioning alcoholic cop from NYC, and Amity's new chief of police, to bring the beast to justice. He is aided by overly passionate oceanographer, Matt Hooper, and a grizzled shark hunter, with too much salt water on the brain, by the name of Bartholemew M. Quint.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Our goals</h3>
<p>  Making a show like this is more than just hard work and talented contributors, it also takes a good amount of money to get it off the ground. We are asking for 5,525 dollars in order to make this show a reality.</p>
<p>  Every cent of the money made on this fundraising campaign, even if we don't meet our initial goal, goes to a certain aspect of the shows production including, but not limiited to:</p>
<p>   - Theater Rental (Because space isn't cheap)</p>
<p>   - Crew payment (Choreographer, Music Director, Stage manager, etc)</p>
<p>   - Costumes, Props and Sets (We do have a man-size shark suit after all)</p>
<p>   - Marketing and advertisment (To help us reach all the Finatics we can)</p>
<p>To help us reach this lofty goal, we've created some great perks to show our donors how much we appreciate them, including: Special thanks on our DVD and Program, Tickets to the show and our after party, souvenir photos and posters, copies of the dvd and even t-shirts!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>   Your contributions will help us bring this fun and unique show to fruition. Our goal has always been to make a show that is not only entertaining, but also an endearing gift to the fans of the film. Members of our production team have successfully created such popular live shows as The Show Below, Attend the Tale of Danny Tanner: A Full House Musical and Jersey Shore: The Musical. These past projects have been a labor of love and this show is no different. Even if we are unable to raise our entire goal, we will strive to put on the best show we can, because that is what we do. </p>

Horse Trade has been producing theater in the East Village since 1998.   We offer inexpensive space rental for self-producing artists; we produce with guest artists, resident artists, and our veteran resident artists. Horse Trade hosts FRIGID New York, a festival that gives 100% of the box office back to the artists, The Fire This Time, a festival that gives voices to emerging African American Playwrights and Imbewu, a contemporary South African theater festival. We bring performers from Canada, South Africa, and all over the United States.

<p><strong>A Message from No.11 Productions' Co-Artistic Directors Ryan Emmons &amp; Julie Congress</strong></p>
<p>We are thrilled to be presenting our original, interactive musical comedy <em>Quest for the West: Adventures on the Oregon Trail! </em>in the New York International Fringe Festival this August!

</div>
<div>
<p>We have been developing and workshopping <em>Quest for the West: Adventures on the Oregon Trail!</em> since December of 2010. The musical had its world premiere in the FRIGID New York festival and then went on to productions at the Kentucky Reperatory Theatre, the Capital Fringe Festival and the SaratogaArtsFest. Now, after over a year and a half of developing and refining, we are ready to bring this new and improved version back to NYC!</p>
<p><em>Quest for the West</em> embodies the mission of No.11 Productions – it highlights the strength of the human spirit and the importance of hope.  We hope this musical brings laughter and a sense of play to everyone who comes to see it as well as the courage to face the unknown, take risks and pursue their dreams.  </p>
<p><strong>Our Goal</strong></p>
<p>We are aiming to raise $5,500 through this campaign. Here’s what your tax-deductible donation will cover:</p>

<p><strong>About the Show</strong></p>
<p>1848. Oregon fever has swept the fledgling nation. Jebediah and his wagon party embark on a 2,000-mile journey West.  On the trail, the party encounters rivers (how will they cross? You decide…it’s interactive!), animals to hunt (“get out your balls, it’s time to go hunting”), prickly pear cacti (help them jump over these dangerous succulents!) and the ever present danger of dwindling water rations…and dysentery!  Along their quest, the pioneers’ journey is filled with more than dirt trails.  Romance develops; deep secrets &amp; betrayals are revealed; and Jebediah’s darkness gets…darker.  </p>
<p>This 90-minute musical comedy is a scored interactive game for the audience which works together as a team to determine the events that occur.  Play well and you may just make it onto the Top 10 Score Board!  2,000 miles.  90 minutes. 11 songs.  8 games.  6 characters.</p>

<h3>A quick overview</h3>
<p>We are Rust Co-Operative, an independent Cape Town-based theatre company. One of our productions, <em>The View</em>, has been selected for the International Dublin Gay Theatre Festival. We are raising funds to get the writer/director, designer/stage manager, and two actors to Dublin!</p>
<p>Recently nominated for 3 prestigious Fleur Du Cap Awards - Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress and Best New Director.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>We are Rust Co-Operative, a Cape Town-based independent theatre company. Penny Youngleson and Philip Rademeyer founded Rust Co-Operative at the beginning of 2012 in order to create a playspace for young theatre-makers wishing to create new South African theatre works. </p>
<p>Philip (27 years old) completed his undergrad in the States and returned to Cape Town to complete his Honours and Masters (in Directing), with a focus on queer theory, at University of Cape Town (UCT). He currently teaches part-time in the UCT Drama Department.</p>
<p>Penny (26 years old) did her undergrad and Honours at University of Stellenbosch and went on to do her Masters at UCT (in Theatre-Making). Outside of Rust Co-Operative, she freelances in set and costume design and construction and styling. She also teaches drama and creative writing.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>About our name </h3>
<p>A co-operative runs on the model of an autonomous group of people who cooperate for their mutual, social, economic, and cultural benefit. We wanted to start a co-operative so that we could collaborate with like-minded artists and help contribute towards building momentum and synergy in the local scene. </p>
<p><br/> We called it the 'Rust' co-operative because we believe in the value and beauty of things that have got a story to tell. There's not a lot of narrative in perfection; but something or someone that's lived a bit and been weathered by life often has a distressed attraction. We like stories and perspectives of people on the outside or on the edge of groups: the people who don't fit easily into spaces and categories. These are our rusty people.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our project  </h3>
<p>One of our shows, <em>The View</em>, has been selected to be part of the International Dublin Gay Theatre Festival, in May 2013. After sell-out audiences and a very positive critical and public response to the first season last year, we were accepted into the Festival and are proud to represent South Africa on the international stage. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our campaign</h3>
<p>This project aims to raise funds for our co-operative to travel to Dublin in May. The festival has been very generous in waiving participation, technical and venue fees. However, that means we need to raise a substantial amount of money to get to Dublin, have accommodation and subsistence allowances. We are not raising funds for salaries for any members of the co-operative. All money raised will go directly towards performing the show in Dublin, and spreading what we think is a worthwhile message.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>About the play &amp; its message</h3>
<p>In <em>The View</em>, a young man sits alone in a cell at an undisclosed location, looking down at a ruined earth and dreaming of being rescued. A gatekeeper arrives with his final request: a video containing interviews with various people from his life. Through a series of conversations between the boy and these people (including family members, historical figures and characters from his imagination) <em>The View</em> illuminates the boy’s life and relationships, and also reveals the reason for his incarceration. <em>The View</em> deals with notions of loss, grief, memory and hope. The Dublin show will feature Ella Gabriel &amp; Roelof Storm. Written and directed by Philip Rademeyer and designed by Penelope Youngleson.</p>
<p>The play was inspired by an American pastor’s recent comments that gays and lesbians should be contained in isolated enclosures and ultimately become extinct as they will not be able to reproduce. Such comments can be seen as far-fetched, but it is reminiscent of the Holocaust and, a bit closer to home for us, apartheid. In our African context, such threats also take on greater meaning as queer lives seem to be continuously under assault on our continent. In the majority of African countries homosexuality is still illegal, it is punishable by death in some, and even though South Africa offers constitutional protection for queers, many gays and lesbians still suffer. This play explores a world where homophobic rhetoric is institutionalised, and thus offers a picture of a scary future for queers unless we continue fighting for equality.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How you can help </h3>
<p>The money we are trying to raise here will go towards making our performance in Dublin possible. We are requesting the following (for 4 people):</p>
<p>$3636 for return flights from Cape Town to Dublin</p>
<p>$1750 for accommodation (for 4 people for 11 days)</p>
<p>$1250 for food and public transport (for 4 people for 11 days) </p>
<p>$454 for travel insurance</p>
<p>$250 to insure the show</p>
<p><strong>$7340 TOTAL</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If we don't reach the full goal, we will take out personal loans to fund this project. We believe in the importance of a show such as this, and we'll go to any lengths to make it happen, even if that means accruing personal loans that we have to pay off over a number of years! </p>
<p>Any help will be greatly appreciated!</p>

<p><strong>Who We Are: People on a Stage</strong></p>
<p>People on a Stage is a performance ensemble gathered by Artistic Director Alexa J. Rittichier in September 2012 as she began her thesis work at Columbia College Chicago. The ensemble is made up of Lydia Feuerhelm, Jenny Garnett, Emily Rose, Courtney St.Clair, Michael Chad St. John, and Don Widmer. The performers come from various movement and artistic backgrounds. Primarily interested in how experience accumulates in the body, People on a Stage makes interdisciplinary performance work grown from the experience of being together as a collective through time. The process of making performance work each week is a form of artistic cross-training with a physical activity: examples include acroyoga, rock climbing, Butoh, modern dance, and cardio weight lifting.   </p>
<p>The ensemble has dedicated itself to nine months of working together to develop their debut performance <em>Collecting Ourselves: Bone Stacking</em>. The commitment to participate in a collective creative practice encourages participants to think about otherness or to think about the self in relationship to others. It is a social revolution. It is a spiritual discipline</p>
<p><strong>What We Are Doing: Performing</strong></p>
<p>Our performance <em>Collecting Ourselves: Bone Stacking</em> has been accepted to be performed at PSi19: Now Then: Performance and Temporality! (<a href=""../342817/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://psi19.stanford.edu</a>)</p>
<p><em>Collecting Ourselves</em> is a collaborative creative process, a performance and a book. It is a frontier in thinking and acting. <em>Collecting Ourselves</em> addresses our cultural obsession with individualism and fosters a collective cooperative lifestyle that builds harmony and addresses creativity as a group process. The artist book that accompanies the performance is a compilation of the writing and imagery produced by the group.  This document is a concrete representation of the ephemeral time and space spent together in the rehearsal and performance. </p>
<p>The Performance Studies International Conference 19 will be held June 26-30, 2013, at Stanford University in Stanford, California (early registration ends March 31). This is an amazing opportunity and honor for us to not only attend the conference but present as well. As we are based in Chicago, Illinois, the journey for us will not be inexpensive. As recent graduates and current students of Columbia College Chicago, we are in need!</p>
<p>People on a Stage is fully invested in this project and has already given six months of time, energy, and money to this project. Each ensemble member has donated rehearsal time to this project without compensation and Alexa has put her own money into workshops, costumes, props, and media elements for this project.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need: Travel Funds</strong></p>
<p>To be able to attend PSi19 in June, we need to raise travel and registration funds for the ensemble. We estimate it will cost us a total of $7200 for the seven ensemble members to attend the conference.</p>
<p>Budget Breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""ListParagraph"">Flights: $425 x 7 ensemble members= $2975</li>
<li class=""ListParagraph"">Food: $125 x 7 ensemble members= $875</li>
<li class=""ListParagraph"">Early Registration: $200 x 7 ensemble members= $1400</li>
<li class=""ListParagraph"">Van Rental= $550</li>
<li class=""ListParagraph"">Lodging= $1400</li>
<li>Plus extra to cover Indiegogo's fees</li>
</ul>
<p>Total Proposed Budget= $7500</p>
<p>We believe this conference is extremely important for us to attend and will use all funds we raise to get us to California. If we don’t raise the full amount through this campaign, we will pursue other fundraising options to be able to travel to the conference.</p>
<p><strong>Why We Are Doing It: The Impact</strong></p>
<p>The opportunity to present our project is not only amazing for us, but we see this work as challenging and important to others as well.</p>
<p>There are cultural, political and social implications for working the way we do.  It is a resistance to the disembodied communications of texting, facebook, twitter and electronic communication, yet it does not deny their usefulness in our culture. By integrating live-ness and remote-ness seamlessly, we become an example of the infinite creative potential of ensemble.  We believe the active embodied practice of our ensemble is hope for our sustained progress.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>So you can’t contribute monetarily? That doesn’t mean you can’t help!</p>
<p>• Spread the word! We need help spreading the word and making some noise about this campaign. Tell your friends! Tell your family! Shout it from the rooftops... or your facebook page! (For your convenience, you can like use the Indiegogo share tools!) </p>
<p>• Come see us perform! <em>Collecting Ourselves: Bone Stacking</em> will debut at Columbia College Chicago on April 26 and 27. More info at <a href=""http://www.alexajrittichier.com/CollectingOurselves"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.alexajrittichier.com/CollectingOurselves</a></p>

<h3>Suppose you had nightmares, terrible nightmares, every night, night after night.<br/>Exhausted and distraught, where could you turn for rest, for relief, for release?<br/>Suppose there were someone who could lie by your side and dream your nightmare for you, so you could have sweet dreams and deep sleep.<br/><br/>That someone is the Nightmare Dreamer.</h3>
<p> Tattooed Potato are bringing to London this original work of theatre, which premiered last year in Washington, DC.  Our team of fifteen -- actors, designers, production interns and director -- are giving their time and talent; the Blue Elephant Theatre is giving us rehearsal space and a three-week run; and the Royal Victoria Hall Foundation have given us a grant to get started with.  And with a little bit more financial support, we can bring this dream vision into the waking world.</p>
<p><br/>  All funds raised online go directly into the show in the form of:</p>
<p>-- Costumes: Our seven actors play 37 characters!  Making each one slightly different is a huge job.</p>
<p>-- Set-building: We are planning to transform the Blue Elephant Theatre into a vast tent of bedsheets and fort of cushions, a comfortable and safe place to be told a dark and disturbing tale.</p>
<p>-- Prop-making: We have ambitious plans to build from scratch a bed can become anything a sleeper can dream.  We don't want to give away too much about how it will turn and open and unfold, shrink and expand, but suffice it to say that if we have the resrouces to lift it off the drawing board and build it, it will be the stuff of dreams.</p>
<p><br/>  We would love to have your support -- at right, you'll see our scheme to say Thank you with public recognition, artwork by the ensemble, and mementos from the show.  Our most generous donors will be paired with one of the actors, who will give them the inside story through rehearsals and the run of the show, and an Angel donor just might find the Nightmare Dreamer himself knocking at the door, bearing the promise of a night's deep sleep.</p>

<p><b>Who the heck am I?</b></p>
<p>I am an 82-year-old solo performer and
writer telling my story about the life of a feminist before feminism was really
a thing. I never thought of myself as a feminist, but everyone who sees my show
says it’s about feminism. I was born during the depression. I trained to become
a Registered Nurse, have a BA in Psychology, went on to accomplish further
educational goals, gaining a BS in Social Work, and an MA in rehabilitation
counseling. Specializing in mental health, addiction, family therapy and AIDS,
I received a Certificate of Appreciation from the AIDS Coalition of the
Merrimack Valley in 1989 for “outstanding work on behalf of people with AIDS
and helping to spread the message of hope, caring and compassion.” I retired
from nursing in 2006.  </p>
<p>My feminist rumblings came from making
conscious decisions in my own interest instead of placating my husband. It
started with my desire to have an abortion. I found myself pregnant with my
fifth child because my request to have my tubes tied needed to be approved by
my husband – who didn’t find the procedure necessary. Next I decided to go back
to school to get my MA in rehabilitation counseling, and figured that it was
time to finalize my divorce.</p>
<p><b>Why would I want to do this?</b></p>
<p>Performing makes me glow, and this
story is worth hearing. In addition to being a cathartic experience for me, t<span>he issues addressed in my show are still hotly debated today
in our highest courts; women's right to have contraception information and
accessibility, abortion, divorce laws and equal pay for women. My historical
and personal perspective is valuable and relevant now more than ever. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What I need and what you get?</b></p>
<p>I've hired a professional film-maker to
produce and edit this show so I can pass on my part in the history of all
women, to show how one woman dealt with the many choices in her life gaining
strength in a male-dominated society. The costs of producing a video can add
up, and my own limited funding (remember, fixed-income octogenarian) is already
tied up in paying for technical help and theater rental. </p>
<p>If you do contribute you’ll be
acknowledged on Facebook for sure. If you donate more, you’ll also get a pair
of tickets. And if you can donate more than that, I’ll send you your own
personal copy of the DVD for Cheesecake and Demerol.</p>
<p>I ask only what you can afford. If you
can’t give money, I totally understand and only ask you to do whatever you can
to spread the word. </p>

<h3>This Season:</h3>
<p>Fresh off another sold-out season, Shakespeare BASH’d returns with our best season yet. This year we tackle three of the most tantalizing, passionate, fun, and dark plays of the Elizabethan/Jacobean period. </p>
<p>First, we will be continuing our exploration of Shakespeare’s contemporaries with a <strong>staged reading</strong> of one of period’s most notorious playwrights, John Webster, and his tragedy <i><strong>The Duchess of Malfi</strong></i>. This play has literally everything, including: poisoned bibles, fake cadavers, and werewolves!</p>
<p>Next, the company will be taking on one of Shakespeare’s most iconic tragedies: <i><strong>Othello</strong></i>, Shakespeare’s exploration into love, marriage, sacrifice, race, jealousy, among many modern ideas. It is his deepest examination of domestic life and tragedy. Truly, it is one of Shakespeare’s most challenging and significant plays. </p>
<p>Finally, Shakespeare BASH’d tackles <strong><i>As You Like It</i></strong>, Shakespeare’s comedy of love, wit, and transformation. We’ll be immersing ourselves in the wide, strange world of the Forest of Arden, with all its fantastic portrayals of shepherds and courtiers in love. </p>
<p>This coming season, Shakespeare BASH’d continues the intense study of Shakespeare through a modern lense and the wonderful worlds he creates that are still relevant today. Our season will bring to light the very true idea that “All the World’s a Stage.” <br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>How You Can Help:</h3>
<p>The truth of the matter is that theatre requires a great deal of money. We at Shakespeare BASH’d are committed to giving the entirety of our box office revenue to the artists that work with us. </p>
<p>Our goal is to raise money to pay for preliminary costs for the productions this season. We aim to keep costs low, work hard to make our shows simple, and try to allow no waste of time or money into our work. </p>
<p>Our goals include a hard-working company, great text, and a fantastic night for all at a great Toronto bar! Every dollar donated goes a long way to helping make this possible.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Any amount of money to this fundraising campaign will go to a number of very important aspects of putting on a play. We need to pay for our venues, rehearsal space, costumes, props, printing of scripts, transportation, photography, promotion/marketing, etc.</p>
<p>Though we keep our costs low, there are a number of different expenses incurred by producing a play. Any amount of money helps us to properly budget our season in a way that prioritizes the experience of our audience and artists.</p>
<p>We are so fortunate to have the privilege to produce theatre in Toronto. We hope that you will support us in any way you can to continue our wonderful company’s tradition of amazing Shakespeare in great bars across the city.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>About the Company:</h3>
<p><i>A ""Bash"" is a crushing blow. It can be about making an attempt, going at it all your own. It can also be a wild night.</i></p>
<p>Shakespeare BASH’d is an independent theatre company dedicated to the works of William Shakespeare and his contemporaries. Our desire is to present Shakespeare’s plays with a bare bones approach to staging, focusing on the words telling the stories of the plays, and with an emphasis on great acting and company spirit.</p>
<p>We have been producing plays for the last 8 years in Toronto bars across the city, including such well-known bars as the Victory Cafe, the Monarch Tavern, and Junction City Music Hall. For five straight years, we were featured at the Toronto Fringe Festival with sold-out productions, garnering numerous NOW Magazine Best Production and Ensemble notices, and in 2012 we were named Best of Fringe.</p>
<p>During our regular seasons, we have also presented sold-out productions of many of Shakespeare’s most famous plays including: <i>Twelfth Night, Hamlet, Macbeth, Romeo and Juliet, Richard III, </i>and <i>King John.</i></p>
<p>Finally, in 2015 we made a commitment to present staged readings of plays by Shakespeare's most important contemporaries. To this date, we have produced staged readings of Christopher Marlowe’s <i>Edward II</i>, Thomas Middleton and William Rowley’s <i>The Changeling</i>, the first true Elizabethan verse tragedy <i>Gorboduc</i>, and last year’s huge success of Ben Jonson’s <i>Volpone or The Fox</i>.</p>
<p>Shakespeare BASH’d is insatiably focused on presenting the plays of the Elizabethan and Jacobean period with truth, fun, grace, passion, and honesty.</p>

<p>Midnight. Late December, 1937.  Reed, a discredited archeologist and aesthete, is running for his life.

before. Transport yourself back in time to the day The Portland Vase was first
created 2000 years ago and watch as its secrets are unraveled. 
The
Maverick Theatre Company presents a new play “189 Pieces!” at The
British Museum.
At
Maverick we are committed to excellent theatre in extraordinary places, therefore, we
introduce to you, with great delight, our new show developed and directed by
Katie Merritt and written by Sue Blundell: “189 PIECES!”
2014
sees the 25th anniversary
of the last restoration of The Portland Vase, a Roman glass masterpiece
bought by the Dowager Duchess of Portland in 1784. 
In
1845, while on loan to the British Museum, it was deliberately smashed by a
visitor! 
Our
pioneering show “189 pieces” is a fascinating and
dramatic celebration of the extraordinary and significant 2000 year history of
one of the most celebrated and important artifacts at The British
Museum. 
This
quirky, fast-paced and witty piece gives us an insight in to the life of The
Vase, the places it has been, and the characters it has encountered throughout
two millennia of its existence, as well as a few words
from The Vase herself!  
What
makes this such a ground breaking show is that it is a development of
the traditional museum experience allowing the audience to interact and
immerse within the story, enhancing the cultural learning
experience and bringing The Vase and its astonishing history to life. By transposing
the story into a theatrical medium, the story becomes
animated and vibrant, appealing to a wider audience and strengthening and
expanding its legacy.
Sue
Blundell is a writer and lecturer in classical studies, where she has found
inspiration within her work with ancient myths, philosophical ideas and an
array of rich and interesting artifacts. Sue came across Maverick Theatre
Company and Director Katie Merritt at Maverick's production of “Under Milk
Wood” at The Wheatsheaf, Fitzrovia on the 60th anniversary of Dylan
Thomas's death last year. 
Sue
and Katie’s collaboration has been a particularly successful one, bringing
together different styles and thoughts to the development of the script.,
both are now very excited to execute the project utilising elements of physical
theatre, puppetry and interactive theatre.
BUT
WE NEED YOUR HELP. 
We would like the
opportunity to make as much of the show as possible with a budget to pay the actors,
director, rehearsal space and to produce flyers to promote the show and
the interactive theatre concept at the museum.
Our
Target is £2950
5 professional
actors playing 28 parts in total.
Costumes
Rehearsal
Space 
Set Design
Marketing
Costs and Expenses
Our
main priority is to pay the actors for their time and endeavour to perform this
pioneering play and learning concept.
Our
future plans are to create similar shows in collaboration with the British
Museum and other Museums that look at the untold histories of important
artIfacts that entertain, inspire and develop cultural knowledge and diversity,
Even a small donation through our Indiegogo campaign will be greatly appreciated or if you prefer to make a donation by phone please call us on 07581586022,
and together we can make sure the memory of The Portland
Vase lives on!
If
not, we do understand, but please do share our link on your Facebook and
Twitter, using the Indiegogo share tools, to get the word out about us and what
we are trying to achieve. Please do tweet us on @LondonLiteraryPubs.
Alternatively,
please do come and see the show and tell us what you think! To BOOK follow the

Initially Women Rules was a short film but then thought that it would not do justice to the characters to wrap them in just 25-30 mins. Hence we decided to wait a little longer &amp; pitch for feature instead. Under my production company Sun Om Productions we have made 5 short films in 2013, all Written/Produced/Directed by me. All the previous films have very diverse subjects with a social message.</p><p>Women Rules by far was the most difficult script to write for me. It will be  even more difficult to film. It deals with the issues Women face in 2014 where gender equality is only on paper. Even today Women go through gender inequality in many aspects of their lives. This includes but is not limited to  Abuse/ Sexual harassment/ Molestation/ and are considered to be a weak gender in general. </p><p>This film is by no means to offend any person/gender. This is a fictional world but the concepts in the film definitely deserve a moment in everyones time to be thoughtfully reflected on.</p><p>Short Film: <b>Living with Imperfections</b></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FZxq0W-dDS_o%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DZxq0W-dDS_o&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FZxq0W-dDS_o%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p><p>Short Film: <b>Sacrifice</b></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FwLhdITQdYbs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DwLhdITQdYbs&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FwLhdITQdYbs%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p><p>Short Film: <b>Love Expired</b></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F388ZhmcNtLg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D388ZhmcNtLg&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F388ZhmcNtLg%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p><p>Short Film: <b>Miss India International</b> ( under post-production )</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/448761/files/20140320201222-1658584_657449447653872_1297040572_o.jpg?1395371542"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>Short Film: <b>The other side of New York</b> ( coming soon )</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Foulzmj2Eeio%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Doulzmj2Eeio&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Foulzmj2Eeio%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p><br/></p><h3><b>CAST</b></h3><p><b>Natalie Pavalek</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/598495/files/20140522203904-420122_574812449906_1864214643_n.jpg?1400816344"" src="""" style=""width: 224px; height: 336px;""/></b></p><b><br/></b><p></p><p><b>Erin Callahan</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/564678/files/20140507163320-1471736_963049184916_1351097345_n.jpg?1399505600"" src="""" style=""width: 255.51272727272726px; height: 239px;""/></p><p><b>Nisha Kalamdani</b></p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/448827/files/20140320205012-1237454_10201596164218853_2035279734_o.jpg?1395373812"" src="""" style=""width: 187.122754491018px; height: 251px;""/></b></p><p><b>Ania Jarda</b></p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/448831/files/20140320205141-1003053_1411847429028271_848391940_n.jpg?1395373901"" src="""" style=""width: 226px; height: 226px;""/></b></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Cory Boughton</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/598497/files/20140522204125-240266_2096451056859_483078_o.jpg?1400816485"" src="""" style=""width: 270.69053708439895px; height: 180px;""/></b></p><b><br/></b><p></p><p><b>Hesh Sarmalkar</b></p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/448838/files/20140320205432-64850_3225947780313_1627928127_n.jpg?1395374072"" src="""" style=""width: 164.91217564870257px; height: 259px;""/></b></p><p><b>Alejandro Martinez</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/598498/files/20140522204230-1425547_506095686164574_1219344152_n.jpg?1400816550"" src="""" style=""width: 257.04753820033955px; height: 463px;""/></b></p><p></p><p><br/></p><p><b>Sumend Wankhede</b></p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/448848/files/20140320205739-150443_10200667838445886_1095642320_n.jpg?1395374259"" src="""" style=""width: 204.34146341463412px; height: 295px;""/></b></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br/><p></p><p>

We follow the lives of Jennifer, Shelly, Chelsea & Claire. They all living in Men's world. Jennifer is 8 months pregnant and married to Keith.  They are madly in love with each other & dreaming of their 1st child but soon Jennifer's heart breaks when she finds out about Keith's affair with another girl.Shelly has been married to Joseph for long time. They have no children.  Shelly has accepted the life of an abused wife.Chelsea & Claire work together as a bartenders.  They are both visually raped by many of their customers until one day Claire gets Raped & killed for real.How would Men react if they were in the position of the women in these stories? Writer/Director  Vinay Pujara.Statement : It took me over 1 year to write the script for Women Rules. Initially Women Rules was a short film but then thought that it would not do justice to the characters to wrap them in just 25-30 mins. Hence we decided to wait a little longer & pitch for feature instead. Under my production company Sun Om Productions we have made 5 short films in 2013, all Written/Produced/Directed by me. All the previous films have very diverse subjects with a social message.Women Rules by far was the most difficult script to write for me. It will be  even more difficult to film. It deals with the issues Women face in 2014 where gender equality is only on paper. Even today Women go through gender inequality in many aspects of their lives. This includes but is not limited to  Abuse/ Sexual harassment/ Molestation/ and are considered to be a weak gender in general. This film is by no means to offend any person/gender. This is a fictional world but the concepts in the film definitely deserve a moment in everyones time to be thoughtfully reflected on.Short Film: Living with ImperfectionsShort Film: SacrificeShort Film: Love ExpiredShort Film: Miss India International ( under post-production )Short Film: The other side of New York ( coming soon )CASTNatalie PavalekErin CallahanNisha KalamdaniAnia JardaCory BoughtonHesh SarmalkarAlejandro MartinezSumend Wankhede

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Crunch: </p>
<p>Three best friends from high school, run aground on shitty jobs and instability in their early twenties, try to keep their adolescent love for each other alive while caring for a fourth friend who has become a powerful, ravenous, cave-dwelling entity. Even worse, the neighborhood gay bar is a total ghost town and the Target is closed. 'Crunch' explores the intimacy and pressures of female friendship, the complexity of looking for justice when there's no clear place to put blame, and 101 fun and easy ways to cling to heterosexuality by your fingernails.</p>
<p>Waxworks:</p>
<p>A group of excited, exhausted, hopeful Millenials who make way too many jokes about Brecht. They met at colleges and theaters around Los Angeles and, against all prudent advice, decided to spend every free moment making the best theater they can. Waxworks is a company well-versed in American classical and international leftist theater, and has big plans to play with formal and relational boundaries once they find a place to rehearse.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> We are doing this show for the 2018 Company Creation Festival at Son of Semele. It is happening. The show has been developed, rehearsed, and is just about ready to be put up. We need your help to make this show look and sound as amazing as possible. We have to buy too many ladybugs and would like to be able to pay our crew.</p>
<p>For your donations you will receive various perks from Creature Beth premonitions written by our badass lady writer to patches and posters designed by our resident lady artist.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Crunch has a lot to say about living under immense situational pressure and internal emotional torsion, which we think are things a lot of our audience is living through and chewing over this year. If you know the horror of working retail, being closeted, or watching friends drift away, come on over and let us hurt your feelings some more. If you want to revisit the wide-open happiness of your first love, your favorite terrible bar, or just the REI, we have the show for you, and we need the money to get you a chair to watch it on. </p>

<p><span>Montreal-born but raised on the East coast, Michele returned to her roots to pursue her education in dance at Concordia University. Upon exploring her creativity within 4 years of study she realized the ocean had a larger affect on her than initially thought with the image of the power and fluid nature of waves crashing against a Nova Scotian shoreline influencing her movement. Physical in nature with a focus on Power and femininity, her movement creates a dialogue between fluidity and strength. While very interested in exploring the capabilities of the human body and with an apparent focus on movement, her drive to create stems from personal experiences bound by emotion. Her interest in the similarities and differences between our emotional reactions as civilized beings and those of animals influences her movement choices. Music and musicality always play a large role in her process whether it be sourced from an inner rhythm or external forms; this along with her admiration for lines comes from an extensive early education in Ballet.</span></p>

<p><span>Being accepted into an independent study has given me the opportunity to explore the kinds of obstacles and challenges I will be facing working as a choreographer in todays world. With the supervision of a Professor, I hope to overcome some of these challenges while working on my first ever full length dance piece. This experience will act as a stepping stone on my way to life as what I hope to be, a successful artist. This however is just my individual vision. Since this project has began, the idea of presenting this full length work as part of a two evening long event involving another very talented choreographer Sophia Wright, and other visual artist has taken off. The goal of this event is to allow for graduating, up and coming artist to present their work outside of the walls of Concordia where they have been educated, and feed it to the vast artistic communities of montreal, in a safe fun, multidisciplinary environment.<br/></span></p>

<h2>About Chronicles of the Uterus</h2>
<p><em>Chronicles of the Uterus</em> speaks about the secondary functions of the uterus, other than sustaining life, its capacity to create destroy and preserve.</p>
<p>Dark pregnancy : the destruction, is the first story of the trilogy followed by Mrs Chambers and the brain: the preservation and P: the creation.</p>
<p>My purpose is to film a video of the piece with cinematic qualities that will capture the trepid intimacy. The piece can be submitted to film or choreography festivals. All the funding raised in this campaign will go to film Dark Pregnancy only and will go to pay for the venue, collaborator's fees and post production.</p>

<h3>Creating Awareness</h3>
<p>This project creates awareness of the importance of the uterus in a woman's life, this pieces is an ode to the organ. According to ancient cultures, the uterus is considered an organ of direct apprehension of knowledge, without having to pass through a thought process, it could facilitate pure perception. It is strongly connected with power and creativity. In addition, the uterus plays a role in hormonal regulation, sexual satisfaction as well as bowel and bladder functions; its removal is not advisable.</p>
<p>On the contrary , modern medicine considers the organ has no value after a woman's child bearing years. This though process has been transfered to woman themselves-they consider there is no purpose of keeping the organ after having chidren if the is any dysfunction with it.</p>
<p>We need to understand how subtle and at the same time how obvious to preserve the uterus is, for the spiritual, mental and emotional well being of women and ultimately of society. </p>

The hand of Terpsichore took<br/>me firmly, and I had no choice but to be an artist.</p>
<p>After years of classic training in ballet and contemporary movement, I continued<br/>my artistic exploration in New York City.

<p>This is my first independent performance project.</p>
<p>I know sometimes money is short and being an artist you get to live it more vividly, but I will be very very happy if you can spread the word about the project and if you can donate at least $1 it will be like having coffe together.</p>

<h2><strong>RICHARD III AT FAIRY LAKE</strong></h2>
<p>Pell-Mell Players presents Richard III at Fairy Lake (in Newmarket, Ontario), with 2 performances FREE to the public.</p>
<p align=""center""><em>“March on, join bravely, let us to’t pell-mell! If not to heaven, hand in hand to hell!”</em></p>
<p>Our company is composed entirely of committed volunteers who are all local residents of the Newmarket area. Our diverse experiences with Arts Huron, Pickering College, Resurgence Theatre and other local theatre programs have moved us to continue a life in the theatre right here in our home-town.</p>
<h3><strong>WHAT: --   RICHARD III (by William Shakespeare)</strong></h3>
<h3>
<strong>                  </strong><strong>2 live, open-air performances</strong>
</h3>
<h3><strong>                  FREE to the public</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>WHERE: -- Fairy Lake Amphitheatre, Newmarket, Ontario Canada</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>WHEN: --   Tuesday, August 6<sup>th</sup>, 2013 – 7:30 p.m. </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>                  AND</strong></h3>
<h3>
<strong>                  </strong><strong>Thursday, August 8<sup>th</sup>, 2013 – 7:30 p.m.</strong>
</h3>
<h3><strong>HOW: --    With the support of our patrons and sponsors!</strong></h3>
<p>The words of William Shakespeare belong to everyone and our community has been so nurturing to its young artists that we would like to give back with free theatre.</p>
<p>Richard III was in the news this year for the first time in centuries, bringing added relevance to Shakespeare’s darkly comic portrayal of the first, true supervillain in its title character. Young audiences in the Newmarket area are primed to have a young anti-hero in their midst.</p>
<h3><strong><em>WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT …</em></strong></h3>
<p>In Shakespeare’s time, plays were performed not only for the nobles who could afford a cushion, but for the <em>groundlings</em> that paid a penny and were treated to the same spectacle as the royal court. We’re reaching high and low, the same way Shakespeare did, and offering our two performances in August, open and FREE-to-the-public on a “pay-what-you-can” basis. <em><strong>And for this, we need patrons!</strong></em></p>
<p>Your support makes it possible for us to offer two performances <strong>FREE</strong> to the public at the Fairy Lake Amphitheatre (Newmarket, Ontario).</p>

<p> </p></div>","RICHARD III AT FAIRY LAKE
Pell-Mell Players presents Richard III at Fairy Lake (in Newmarket, Ontario), with 2 performances FREE to the public.
“March on, join bravely, let us to’t pell-mell! If not to heaven, hand in hand to hell!”
Our company is composed entirely of committed volunteers who are all local residents of the Newmarket area. Our diverse experiences with Arts Huron, Pickering College, Resurgence Theatre and other local theatre programs have moved us to continue a life in the theatre right here in our home-town.
WHAT: --   RICHARD III (by William Shakespeare)

                  2 live, open-air performances

                  FREE to the public
WHERE: -- Fairy Lake Amphitheatre, Newmarket, Ontario Canada
WHEN: --   Tuesday, August 6th, 2013 – 7:30 p.m. 
                  AND

                  Thursday, August 8th, 2013 – 7:30 p.m.

HOW: --    With the support of our patrons and sponsors!
The words of William Shakespeare belong to everyone and our community has been so nurturing to its young artists that we would like to give back with free theatre.
Richard III was in the news this year for the first time in centuries, bringing added relevance to Shakespeare’s darkly comic portrayal of the first, true supervillain in its title character. Young audiences in the Newmarket area are primed to have a young anti-hero in their midst.
WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT …
In Shakespeare’s time, plays were performed not only for the nobles who could afford a cushion, but for the groundlings that paid a penny and were treated to the same spectacle as the royal court. We’re reaching high and low, the same way Shakespeare did, and offering our two performances in August, open and FREE-to-the-public on a “pay-what-you-can” basis. And for this, we need patrons!
Your support makes it possible for us to offer two performances FREE to the public at the Fairy Lake Amphitheatre (Newmarket, Ontario).
It’s on-ground seating in the beautiful amphitheatre area of Fairy Lake – so don’t forget to BYOB (Bring Your Own BLANKET), lawn chairs or pillows to maximize your comfort and enjoyment of this unique outdoor theatre experience.
We are offering rewards of two types: Production Rewards (related to how the production was developed), and Audience Rewards (to make your performance attendance as comfortable and enjoyable as possible.) Donations from supporters will be rewarded at different levels as outlined in the Campaign Perks.

<p>My name is Casey Groves, and I am the Artistic Director of Inner Compass Theatre. My wife, Rachel Whitman Groves, and I are acting in a production of <em>Hogan’s Goat</em> by William Alfred in New Orleans this spring, and we are asking for your help in funding it. <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/Inner-Compass-Theatre/174589632660858"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Inner Compass Theatre on Facebook.</a></p>
<p>I started acting in high school and went to New Orleans Center for Creative Arts. I was an adjunct theater professor and director of the Greek Theatre Project at St. Peter's College in NJ for 6 years, and I currently teach acting classes at the Healing Center in New Orleans. I produced and acted in a successful Off Broadway production and national tour of the one man play, <em>Damien</em>; and I've performed it 150 times. <a href=""http://www.imdb.me/caseygroves"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Casey's IMDB Page.</a></p>
<h3>The Play</h3>
<p><em>Hogan's Goat</em> opens on Sunday, May 20th and we are very happy to be partnering with the IRISH HOUSE on St. Charles to put this production on. The play is a battleground between faith and ambition in an Irish Immigrant community during a mayor’s race in Brooklyn in 1890. There are strong parallels in this modern verse play to our own Irish Channel and to the coming backbiting of the 2012 elections. The site-specific, dark wood warmth and yesteryear decor of the IRISH HOUSE provides the perfect atmosphere for this play that takes place in pubs and townhouses. This is the inaugural production for the recently returned NOLA natives who are starting Inner Compass Theatre.</p>
<p>Rachel and I fell in love with this play after doing a scene from it with renowned acting coach, Larry Moss, in NYC last year. <em>Hogan's Goat</em> is a morality play in verse about love, scandal and blind ambition in an Irish Immigrant community during a mayoral election in Brooklyn in 1890. The poetry is powerful, the stakes are high, the lessons are mammoth, and you can't help but empathize with each of the multidimensional well drawn characters no matter whose side they're on. There are strong parallels to ""The Scottish Play"" and ""Othello"" set within a semi-modern Irish American context.

My name is Casey Groves, and I am the Artistic Director of Inner Compass Theatre. My wife, Rachel Whitman Groves, and I are acting in a production of Hogan’s Goat by William Alfred in New Orleans this spring, and we are asking for your help in funding it. Inner Compass Theatre on Facebook.
I started acting in high school and went to New Orleans Center for Creative Arts. I was an adjunct theater professor and director of the Greek Theatre Project at St. Peter's College in NJ for 6 years, and I currently teach acting classes at the Healing Center in New Orleans. I produced and acted in a successful Off Broadway production and national tour of the one man play, Damien; and I've performed it 150 times. Casey's IMDB Page.
The Play
Hogan's Goat opens on Sunday, May 20th and we are very happy to be partnering with the IRISH HOUSE on St. Charles to put this production on. The play is a battleground between faith and ambition in an Irish Immigrant community during a mayor’s race in Brooklyn in 1890. There are strong parallels in this modern verse play to our own Irish Channel and to the coming backbiting of the 2012 elections. The site-specific, dark wood warmth and yesteryear decor of the IRISH HOUSE provides the perfect atmosphere for this play that takes place in pubs and townhouses. This is the inaugural production for the recently returned NOLA natives who are starting Inner Compass Theatre.
Rachel and I fell in love with this play after doing a scene from it with renowned acting coach, Larry Moss, in NYC last year. Hogan's Goat is a morality play in verse about love, scandal and blind ambition in an Irish Immigrant community during a mayoral election in Brooklyn in 1890. The poetry is powerful, the stakes are high, the lessons are mammoth, and you can't help but empathize with each of the multidimensional well drawn characters no matter whose side they're on. There are strong parallels to ""The Scottish Play"" and ""Othello"" set within a semi-modern Irish American context. Ugly truths are faced squarely and political machinations are seen up close and personal. Each of us has drives and impulses which take us away from our truest selves. Through exposing them one by one, we as an audience will hopefully gain greater awareness of these impulses in ourselves and avoid the pitfalls they present. The play addresses the subhuman conditions faced by the Irish as they crossed the Atlantic as well as the opportunities that some seized in this new Promised Land. The play has us embrace deep religious faith through some of the characters, and it has us challenge faith in pursuit of a more mature relationship with God through other characters. Ultimately, pride and ambition are the emperor's new clothes that are worn and paraded with pomp across the stage.
Our goal is to raise $8,000 for the production. %5 of all the money you give to this project will go to the Ancient Order of Hibernians to feed people in need through the Hibernian Hunger Project which honors and commemorates the Great Famine of Ireland. The Famine created a hunger in people getting off the boat with a need to fill it by ""getting power"" (as the play states). Your contributions will help to alleviate that kind of hunger enabling recipients to lead a more balanced and faith filled life.

<p>Hello! I'm so sorry I haven't updated you all in a while. I've been super busy with school and finals are coming up very soon! Grrr. In a week, school will be over for this year and summer vacation will finally be here. You all might be wondering what I am doing this summer... :) As of right now, I plan on putting all my time and energy into theatre/film/acting. I have a summer internship at The Theatre Lab at the Firehouse Theatre Project and some pretty amazing things will happen at FTP this summer (including Rocky Horror Picture Show....ahhh!). To add on, I'm heading up to NYC for an intensive. I also have some ""mini projects"" going on now and this summer. You can find out more about them at: <a href=""http://www.natashaYliu.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.natashaYliu.com</a> .  </p>
<p>You all might be wondering how I had enough $$$ to pay for the intensive (because I'm saving up every cent for IAA). To be honest, I was thinking about not doing the intensive anymore and putting the money towards IAA tuition/expenses, but I paid for the intensive long before I even auditioned for IAA and the money deposited towards it was, of course, non-refundable. Well, on the bright side, I will be learning much and will get to see if I can survive NYC alone on a super tight budget. :) </p>

This is the first time in 10 years that PRIVATE LIVES will be produced in the
Los Angeles/Burbank area. Weâ€™re assembling a team of professional actors,
designers and other creative talents to help bring Cowardâ€™s clever comedy from

We have set a goal of $10,000 for this campaign, but even that does not cover
all of the expenses weâ€™ll incur by opening day. Ticket sales will help
contribute to our bottom line once the play opens, but like most live theater
productions, theyâ€™ll only cover about 50 percent of our total cost. <br/><br/>

â€œDevastatingly funny.â€ â€œAn iridescent bubble of a play.â€ â€œSomething to go silly
over.â€ â€œAll but continuous laughter.â€<br/><br/>
Those are just a few of the accolades heaped upon the original 1930 production
of PRIVATE LIVES, which follows the saga of perpetually dueling lovers Amanda
and Elyot, two divorcees who unwittingly book adjoining rooms while
honeymooning with their new spouses. They soon realize the folly of their new
marriages and impulsively flee together to , only to be caught days later by their
jilted spouses. <br/><br/>
This stylish, savvy and still-timely comedy is loaded with pointed barbs about
modern romance that anyone can relate to. <br/><br/>
Written in 1930, the original production of Private Lives starred NoÃ«l Coward,
Gertrude Lawrence, Adrianne Allen and Laurence Olivier. The play has been
revived many times on Broadway (including a memorable 1983 production that
starred Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton), and has been produced in theaters
throughout the world. <br/><br/>

Los Angeles/Burbank area. Weâ€™re assembling a team of professional actors,
designers and other creative talents to help bring Cowardâ€™s clever comedy from
the page to the stage. Award-winning stage director Jules Aaron has signed on to
direct. The cast will be announced in mid January. And
hereâ€™s where you come in... 

Your generous contribution will go directly towards the production costs,
including: theatre rental, royalties, director, set design, light design, sound
design, costume design, stage management, marketing, publicity, and
advertising. 
We have set a goal of $10,000 for this campaign, but even that does not cover
all of the expenses weâ€™ll incur by opening day. Ticket sales will help
contribute to our bottom line once the play opens, but like most live theater
productions, theyâ€™ll only cover about 50 percent of our total cost. 
So, letâ€™s see how much we can raise above and beyond the $10,000 goal!
Donations of every amount are welcomed. No amount is too smallâ€”or too large!So why PRIVATE LIVES?

â€œDevastatingly funny.â€ â€œAn iridescent bubble of a play.â€ â€œSomething to go silly
over.â€ â€œAll but continuous laughter.â€
Those are just a few of the accolades heaped upon the original 1930 production
of PRIVATE LIVES, which follows the saga of perpetually dueling lovers Amanda
and Elyot, two divorcees who unwittingly book adjoining rooms while
honeymooning with their new spouses. They soon realize the folly of their new
marriages and impulsively flee together to , only to be caught days later by their
jilted spouses. 
This stylish, savvy and still-timely comedy is loaded with pointed barbs about
modern romance that anyone can relate to. 
Written in 1930, the original production of Private Lives starred NoÃ«l Coward,
Gertrude Lawrence, Adrianne Allen and Laurence Olivier. The play has been
revived many times on Broadway (including a memorable 1983 production that
starred Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton), and has been produced in theaters
throughout the world. 
Now, with your help, PRIVATE LIVES will be coming to GTC Burbank.Who is Table for Two Productions?

This creation is the first </span>under<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> the sole directorship of Terry Crane. </span><br/></p>
<p><b>Our Project - </b></p>
<p>The Acrobatic Conundrum returns fresh to the studio to explore new possibilities and combine the techniques of circus with the language of dance, in an all new contemporary circus show. The show will feature six established artists (Terry Crane, Erica Rubinstein, Carey Cramer, Ty Vennewitz, Jacki Ward, and Nicolo Kehrwald) newly allied together for this creation.  Under the artistic direction of seasoned dancer/choreographer, <a href=""http://ktniehoff.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">KT Niehoff</a>, the work has already begun to take shape.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The show will debut at host and sponsor location: <a href=""www.sancaseattle.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">SANCA</a>, the <b>School of Acrobatics &amp; New Circus Arts</b> in Seattle, August 15, 16 &amp; 17.  We would love to see our supporters there! </p>
<p>Project 2014 will then fly to New York City to take part in <a href=""http://www.cityparksfoundation.org/calendar/#1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Summerstage</a>, a seasonal series of performances presented by the <a href=""http://www.cityparksfoundation.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">City Parks Association</a>.  The performance on August 21st will feature 3 cutting edge circus companies, and Acrobatic Conundrum will be headlining.  A big thank you to <a href=""http://circusnow.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Circus Now</a> for facilitating our involvement. </p>
<p>The next phase of the project will focus on continued rehearsals at SANCA and culminate in presentation of a further developed show at <a href=""http://circusfestvancouver.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CircusFest</a>, the first edition of a new circus festival in November in Vancouver, BC.  We hope that these performances and participation in the <a href=""http://www.westarts.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Western Arts Alliance</a> will generate sufficient bookings to tour our show extensively in the Pacific Northwest in 2015.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/734696/files/20140721234410-8256888536_df6fa858be_o.jpg?1406011450"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>Our Needs - </b></p>
<p>Although we have a couple of paying performances already scheduled, they won't come close to covering our production budget.  Some of our largest expenditures include:</p>
<p>   - Hiring a professional director.  Audiences will be pleased to see Terry back on stage performing KT Niehoff's innovative new work alongside his ensemble.                 </p><p>  - Airfare to New York City...and back again. Summerstage was able to cover half of this expense, but we would love to come back home, and tickets aren't cheap.</p>
<p>  - Sets and costumes, an important and often expensive piece of ACreation.</p>
<p>We think a goal of $6000 is a reasonable target considering our campaign last year raised more than $13,000 to take us to Chicago. YEAH!!!  It is difficult for us to continue asking for support as we strive for sustainability. With the intense competition for very limited government funding of the arts, crowdsourcing campaigns have become an integral fundraising tool for new companies like ours. That said, we are shifting the balance of our fundraising toward grant writing and most importantly new bookings. It is absolutely our goal to eventually become self-sustaining. </p><p>As a collective we are donating hundreds of hours of our time to this project.

</p><p>Carey Cramer comes from a diverse background in classic ballet, tap, jazz, modern dance, muay thai kickboxing and acrobatics. After her first taste of circus just over 6 years ago, she trained intensively under the coaching of Terry Crane for two years before attending the prestigious National Circus School of Montreal. There her professional formation included acrobatics, hand balancing, clowning, singing, and her primary discipline of rope. Influence from hip hop, break dance, and contact improvisation styles along with a passionate love of movement and psychology have transferred to Carey’s work on the rope empowering her with a unique, raw, and dynamic style. She has brought her wide variety of skills to the stage performing in Montreal, Seattle, Vancouver, and even touring with the band ""Heart"" last year. She has just recently moved on from the National School and The Acrobatic Conundrum is the first circus company she has the pleasure to work with.</p>

<p>Erica Rubinstein first discovered circus while studying neuroscience and dance at Oberlin College. With a background of eight years in competitive gymnastics, circus seemed a natural fit. Since college she has trained extensively in her specialty of basing acrobatics at Circus Center (San Francisco, under the guidance of Lu Yi, &amp; Xiaohong), NICA (Australia), DoJump (Portland) and SANCA (Seattle). Past performances include the Chicago Contemporary Circus Festival 2014, Teatro Zinzanni’s Mezzo Lunatico, Circus Bella, and the Moisture Festival. In addition to performing she is director of the Youth Performances Companies at the School of Acrobatics and New Circus Arts (SANCA) in Seattle, Washington where she works with advanced students ages 8 – 18. She has also helped organize multiple national circus conferences and is currently Community Manager for Circus Now, a non profit organization promoting circus across the United States. Erica performs with Terry Crane as duo Retro Verso, a genre and gender challenging partner acrobatics duet that flips our preconceptions on their head.</p><b>Ty Vennewitz</b><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/776732/files/20140809122902-ty_vennewitz.jpeg?1407612542"" src="""" style=""width: 362.1584699453552px; height: 241px;""/></p><p><b>

</b></p><p>Ty Vennewitz grew up and up in Washington state. He discovered dance in higher education and graduated from Western Washington University at the top of his class. His dance credits include the Portland Opera, the A-Wol Dance Collective and a dental commercial as a ballet dancing molar. Ty’s obsession with circus lured him across the continent to the National Circus School in Montreal, where he put on the world’s smallest mask, a red nose, and seriously studied clowning.  He has performed his original  material throughout Quebec, China, and Dubai.  Content to be back in the North West, he is excited to join the Acrobatic Conundrum in their newest creation. </p><p><b>Anna Thomas-Henry – Production Manager</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/776736/files/20140809123026-anna.jpg?1407612626"" src="""" style=""width: 329.3333333333333px; height: 494px;""/></p>
<p>Anna Thomas-Henry is a Seattle native who has been in the performing arts since childhood.

She has won merit scholarships to attend musical theatre conservatory at both CAP21 (New York University) and AMDA (NYC. Graduate). Anna was the first American to study in the musical theatre and voice department of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music (Shaghai, China). The Circus arts are a relatively new endeavor for her having began training as an aerialist and acrobat just four years ago. Training includes the Professional Preparatory Programs at both Circus Warehouse (NYC) and SANCA Seattle (First Graduating Class). She has worked as a vocalist, dancer, actor, aerialist and choreographer in NYC, on tour and in Seattle.

The Acrobatic Conundrum is a Seattle based contemporary circus company that was founded in 2012 by Terry Crane and Joselynn Engstrom. The company is dedicated to creating sustainable performance experiences that engage and delight audiences and performers alike. The company has produced three shows to date.  The most recent show, 'The Way Out', headlined the first Chicago Contemporary Circus Festival this past January (thanks to indiegogo supporters!).  In March of 2014, Joselynn and Terry amicably parted ways as co-founders. This creation is the first under the sole directorship of Terry Crane. 
Our Project - 
The Acrobatic Conundrum returns fresh to the studio to explore new possibilities and combine the techniques of circus with the language of dance, in an all new contemporary circus show. The show will feature six established artists (Terry Crane, Erica Rubinstein, Carey Cramer, Ty Vennewitz, Jacki Ward, and Nicolo Kehrwald) newly allied together for this creation.  Under the artistic direction of seasoned dancer/choreographer, KT Niehoff, the work has already begun to take shape.

The show will debut at host and sponsor location: SANCA, the School of Acrobatics & New Circus Arts in Seattle, August 15, 16 & 17.  We would love to see our supporters there! 
Project 2014 will then fly to New York City to take part in Summerstage, a seasonal series of performances presented by the City Parks Association.  The performance on August 21st will feature 3 cutting edge circus companies, and Acrobatic Conundrum will be headlining.  A big thank you to Circus Now for facilitating our involvement. 
The next phase of the project will focus on continued rehearsals at SANCA and culminate in presentation of a further developed show at CircusFest, the first edition of a new circus festival in November in Vancouver, BC.  We hope that these performances and participation in the Western Arts Alliance will generate sufficient bookings to tour our show extensively in the Pacific Northwest in 2015.

She has brought her wide variety of skills to the stage performing in Montreal, Seattle, Vancouver, and even touring with the band ""Heart"" last year. She has just recently moved on from the National School and The Acrobatic Conundrum is the first circus company she has the pleasure to work with.
Erica Rubinstein – Hand to Hand Acrobat
Erica Rubinstein first discovered circus while studying neuroscience and dance at Oberlin College. With a background of eight years in competitive gymnastics, circus seemed a natural fit. Since college she has trained extensively in her specialty of basing acrobatics at Circus Center (San Francisco, under the guidance of Lu Yi, & Xiaohong), NICA (Australia), DoJump (Portland) and SANCA (Seattle). Past performances include the Chicago Contemporary Circus Festival 2014, Teatro Zinzanni’s Mezzo Lunatico, Circus Bella, and the Moisture Festival. In addition to performing she is director of the Youth Performances Companies at the School of Acrobatics and New Circus Arts (SANCA) in Seattle, Washington where she works with advanced students ages 8 – 18. She has also helped organize multiple national circus conferences and is currently Community Manager for Circus Now, a non profit organization promoting circus across the United States. Erica performs with Terry Crane as duo Retro Verso, a genre and gender challenging partner acrobatics duet that flips our preconceptions on their head.Ty Vennewitz

Ty Vennewitz grew up and up in Washington state. He discovered dance in higher education and graduated from Western Washington University at the top of his class. His dance credits include the Portland Opera, the A-Wol Dance Collective and a dental commercial as a ballet dancing molar. Ty’s obsession with circus lured him across the continent to the National Circus School in Montreal, where he put on the world’s smallest mask, a red nose, and seriously studied clowning.  He has performed his original  material throughout Quebec, China, and Dubai.  Content to be back in the North West, he is excited to join the Acrobatic Conundrum in their newest creation. Anna Thomas-Henry – Production Manager
Anna Thomas-Henry is a Seattle native who has been in the performing arts since childhood. Her formative education began locally in the drama department of Seattle Academy of Arts and Sciences (Seattle, WA) and the preparatory dance program of Cornish College of the Arts (Seattle, WA). She has won merit scholarships to attend musical theatre conservatory at both CAP21 (New York University) and AMDA (NYC. Graduate). Anna was the first American to study in the musical theatre and voice department of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music (Shaghai, China). The Circus arts are a relatively new endeavor for her having began training as an aerialist and acrobat just four years ago. Training includes the Professional Preparatory Programs at both Circus Warehouse (NYC) and SANCA Seattle (First Graduating Class). She has worked as a vocalist, dancer, actor, aerialist and choreographer in NYC, on tour and in Seattle. This is Anna’s first foray into performing arts administration and she is thrilled to support Acrobatic Conundrum. 
Jacki Ward - Contortionist
With a history of gymnastics, theatre and visual arts, Jacki entered the circus world in 2005 and pursued her training in Seattle, San Francisco and Buenos Aires. Jacki’s first passion was contortion and hand-balancing, the discipline she has performed locally and abroad.  She has since branched out into a variety of aerial apparatus, and is currently specializing in duo straps and lyra.  Additionally, Jacki is a certified hatha yoga instructor and holds a B.A. in Anthropology of the Performing Arts from the University of Puget Sound. She was a 2011-2012 recipient of the Thomas J. Watson Fellowship, through which she traveled to Mongolia, China, India, France and Canada to study local performance traditions and training methods in contortion and the circus arts. She has coached at the School of Acrobatics and New Circus Arts (SANCA) in Seattle, Cirque du Sound in Tacoma and conducted multiple workshops from Olympia, WA to Malaysia.  She currently teaches and performs with Night Flight Aerial and the Circus Project in her hometown of Portland, OR.
Nicolo Kehrwald - Acrobat, Aerialist
Nicolo Kehrwald began with dance, studying tap, ballet, modern and capoeira and he quickly took to the circus arts when he joined Do Jump! Extremely Physical Theatre in 2001.  During his 12 years as a company member, he developed a high level of skill and versatility as he performed floor acrobatics, trapeze, hoop, straps, Chinese pole, and more.  His passion for circus inspired him to study at circus schools around the globe – some recent highlights include returning to Montreal to train with Yury Bozyan, studying under Claude Victoria in France, and  training with the amazing acrobats of Mongolia under Yanjinbileg and Bud Tumurbaatar.  His first love is handbalancing and floor acrobatics yet he is well versed in aerial apparatus of all sorts.The Acrobatic Conundrum is a sponsored project of Fractured Atlas, a non-profit arts service organization.

Here you go.</p><p>Manasij, a veteran Indian screen actor is visiting USA with a theater group to stage some shows in multiple cities. During his first stop in New York, he is hosted by Deepak and Sharika at their multi-million dollar mansion in upstate New York. The enthusiastic host, Deepak, expresses his desire to make a film with Manasij as the hero and their daughter Pom as the heroine. But Sharika objects to this proposal vehemently. She would never let Pom take part in this dream project of Deepak. Manasij tries to mediate, but soon realizes that he is being pulled into a dark vortex of suspicion and animosity that was carefully camouflaged by the opulence and the veneer of apparent happiness of an affluent immigrant Indian family.</p><h3>Fine! Just Tell Me, How Much You Need?</h3><p>Not much really. The production is planned on a shoestring budget by considering only the bare essentials. Your contribution will pay for the following:</p><p>Cast &amp; Crew remuneration :  $1500.00</p><p>Rehearsal space rental  :         $1000.00</p><p>Light/Sound  :                                 $300.00</p><p>Sets/Props  :                                   $200.00</p><p>Miscellaneous (fees etc.)  :          $500.00</p><p>Total  :                                               $3500.00</p><p>This funding is of the type “all-or-none”. That is, if we don’t receive the entire budgeted amount, we get nothing. So please support us with whatever amount you feel comfortable. See the sidebar for the suggested contribution amounts.</p><h3>And What Do I Get?</h3><p>As a token of our appreciation for your support, we offer some exciting perks. Just check the sidebar on your right. These gifts may not be of great financial value, but they carry our heartfelt gratitude and thanks and also something to remember our production by.</p><h3>But Why CrowdFunding? Why IndiGoGo?</h3><p>Between Sudipta (and his theatre company ECTA) and Bruce (SQTheatreWorks), we have the experience of producing and directing more than twenty plays. But for those productions we used the traditional funding model of sponsorship, grants, and ticket sales. For TACONIC PARKWAY,  we try the crowdfunding model for the first time.  The production will be premiering at the Thespis theater festival where we have no financial controls. Hence, traditional funding models are not viable. We also believe that good theatre is a community art initiative and it can only be sustained by the active support of the community.  Hence, crowdfunding is the most appropriate financing model for theatre for it is the only possible cure for  the infamous “Baumol’s Cost Disease” that plagues the economic world of performing arts.  <br/></p><h3>

Originally trained as a film director, his production often brings the richness of detailed storytelling with unmistakably noticeable organic acting on the stage.   But What Can I Do?To make this collaboration a success, we need another partner - YOU! We need your active support through a small financial contribution which would help in making this project a reality - a New York premiere of TACONIC PARKWAYYou will agree that art is another form of a therapeutic element. We artists can heal people with our craft. And to accomplish this somewhat daring goal, the production needs to happen. It is by no means any fancy and unnecessary presentation.  To be able to ‘heal’ even one person, the art form needs to come alive.  The painting needs to be on canvas, the music needs to be played, the song needs to be sung,  the movements need to be danced, and the play needs to be on stage. The contribution isn’t only about funding the production. It is for a much bigger purpose - to heal and to be healed.That's Good. But What is This Play About?It's about our inner battles. The past seems always like a shadow to the present and it often delves into the future.  It is like an invisible tattoo.  It never fades.  Especially the deep and dark ones. In TACONIC PARKWAY, you will witness the inner battles of three desolate characters with their abusive and dark past. But is it all real? Don’t we often have this feeling that maybe our life is just a play or a movie? Or maybe it's a game, a play. TACONIC PARKWAY lays the beautiful and mysterious path to this dangerous game of  truth or dare.  And guess what? We ALL dare  play this game in life more often than we want.Here is what our Production Assistant Esha Tewari has to say about the play:The Plot Line, Please?Sorry! Here you go.Manasij, a veteran Indian screen actor is visiting USA with a theater group to stage some shows in multiple cities. During his first stop in New York, he is hosted by Deepak and Sharika at their multi-million dollar mansion in upstate New York. The enthusiastic host, Deepak, expresses his desire to make a film with Manasij as the hero and their daughter Pom as the heroine. But Sharika objects to this proposal vehemently. She would never let Pom take part in this dream project of Deepak. Manasij tries to mediate, but soon realizes that he is being pulled into a dark vortex of suspicion and animosity that was carefully camouflaged by the opulence and the veneer of apparent happiness of an affluent immigrant Indian family.Fine! Just Tell Me, How Much You Need?Not much really. The production is planned on a shoestring budget by considering only the bare essentials. Your contribution will pay for the following:Cast & Crew remuneration :  $1500.00Rehearsal space rental  :         $1000.00Light/Sound  :                                 $300.00Sets/Props  :                                   $200.00Miscellaneous (fees etc.)  :          $500.00Total  :                                               $3500.00This funding is of the type “all-or-none”. That is, if we don’t receive the entire budgeted amount, we get nothing. So please support us with whatever amount you feel comfortable. See the sidebar for the suggested contribution amounts.And What Do I Get?As a token of our appreciation for your support, we offer some exciting perks. Just check the sidebar on your right. These gifts may not be of great financial value, but they carry our heartfelt gratitude and thanks and also something to remember our production by.But Why CrowdFunding? Why IndiGoGo?Between Sudipta (and his theatre company ECTA) and Bruce (SQTheatreWorks), we have the experience of producing and directing more than twenty plays. But for those productions we used the traditional funding model of sponsorship, grants, and ticket sales. For TACONIC PARKWAY,  we try the crowdfunding model for the first time.  The production will be premiering at the Thespis theater festival where we have no financial controls. Hence, traditional funding models are not viable. We also believe that good theatre is a community art initiative and it can only be sustained by the active support of the community.  Hence, crowdfunding is the most appropriate financing model for theatre for it is the only possible cure for  the infamous “Baumol’s Cost Disease” that plagues the economic world of performing arts.

<p>Hedda Gabler is the original lethal Desperate Housewife. Ibsen's ""Hedda Gabler"" has been described as the role closest to Hamlet in the female repertoire. Since Hedda was unleashed on the world in 1891, the role has attracted a formidable range of top-flight actresses keen to test themselves against its exceptional demands – from Peggy Ashcroft, Maggie Smith, Joan Greenwood and Janet Suzman to Fiona Shaw, Eve Best, Cate Blanchett, Harriet Walter and most recently Sheridan Smith. We are very excited to bring this extraordinarly complex character to it's Regional Premiere!</p>

<p><strong>The Playwrights....<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Henrik Ibsen</strong> is often ranked as one of the truly great playwrights in the European tradition. Richard Hornby describes him as ""a profound poetic dramatist—the best since Shakespeare"" He is widely regarded as the most important playwright since Shakespeare. He influenced other playwrights and novelists such as George Bernard Shaw, Oscar Wilde, Arthur Miller, James Joyce, and Eugene O'Neill.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Friel</strong> is an Irish dramatist, author and director of the Field Day Theatre Company. He is considered to be one of the greatest living English-language dramatists, hailed by the English-speaking world as an ""Irish Chekhov""and ""the universally accented voice of Ireland"". Friel is best known for plays such as <em>Philadelphia, Here I Come!</em> and <em>Dancing at Lughnasa</em> but has written more than thirty plays in a six-decade spanning career that has seen him elected Saoi of Aosdána. <strong>Aosdána</strong> is an Irish association of artists.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-1""></sup> It was created in 1981 on the initiative of a group of writers and with support from the Arts Council of Ireland. The title of Saoi (lit. ""<em>wise one</em>"") is the highest honour that members of Aosdána can bestow upon a fellow member. No more than seven living members can be so honoured at one time. Membership is by invitation from current members only. His plays have also been a regular feature on Broadway throughout his career.</p>
<p><strong>The Director<br/></strong></p>
<p class=""first"">Jessica Osbourne was born and raised in the small town of Cleethorpes in the North of England and has been working in the Entertainment Industry since the wee age of 11. She has worked on many film and theatre projects, ranging from Actor/Comedienne to Executive Producer. Favourite theatre roles include Puck in Midsummer Night's Dream (Santa Fe Shakespeare Society), Denise in Living Purgatory (Rodey Theatre, UNM), Beth in The Mistakes that Madeleine Made (AuxDog, ABQ) Susy in Wait Until Dark (Vortex, ABQ) &amp; Caliban in the Tempest (Bridewell Theatre, London). Favourite film roles include The Amateur, Shocking Facts, Waste Water, Policy &amp; Mickey.</p>
<p>She started doing Stand up Comedy in 2010 and had the honor of performing in LA’s World Famous “The Comedy Store”, she was also featured on the “Duke City Comedy League” television series and in their LIVE shows, as well as Third Thursday Contest, Young Dumb and Full Comedy shows, Embassy Suites Comedy Room and numerous stand up shows around town. Jessica is also the Producer of Comedy for the Albuquerque Film Festival and founding producer for the Friday Night Live and Second Saturday Standup shows at the Aux Dog Theatre Nob Hill.</p>
<p>Jessica directed her first play ""Les Liaisons Dangereuses"" at the Vortex Theatre in 2003. Recently, she directed ""Two Way Mirror- two Arthur Miller one acts"" at the Southwest Rural Theatre Project. This will mark the first production she helms at the Aux Dog Theatre Nob Hill.</p>
<p><strong>Our Concept<br/></strong></p>
<p>Hedda Gabler is usually performed as a period drama, since this new version takes a more humourous approach to the play, we felt it was important to find a way to modernize the overall perception of the piece. Due to the social contraints that existed in Nineteenth Century society, it was vital that a common ground could be found that both complemented this periods persona yet could be rationalized in the mind of the modern American. So we're very excited to announce that our setting will be early 1960's America. Before the real feminist social revolution began, women still felt obligated to marry and settle down. As the daughter of a wealthy General, Hedda had never been forced to enter the workforce and had no knowledge or experience of what options there may be for her upon her father's untimely demise. After her fathers death, she is left with little choice but to marry someone who meets her standard of social status and conservative lifestlye. Therein lies the rub.</p>

Our Concept
Hedda Gabler is usually performed as a period drama, since this new version takes a more humourous approach to the play, we felt it was important to find a way to modernize the overall perception of the piece. Due to the social contraints that existed in Nineteenth Century society, it was vital that a common ground could be found that both complemented this periods persona yet could be rationalized in the mind of the modern American. So we're very excited to announce that our setting will be early 1960's America. Before the real feminist social revolution began, women still felt obligated to marry and settle down. As the daughter of a wealthy General, Hedda had never been forced to enter the workforce and had no knowledge or experience of what options there may be for her upon her father's untimely demise. After her fathers death, she is left with little choice but to marry someone who meets her standard of social status and conservative lifestlye. Therein lies the rub.

The Tiger’s Bride is ultimately a story
about a woman overcoming objectification and becoming the agent of her own
lifestory.
In a society where women are constantly dehumanised
by messages about having
perfect bodies  in order for corporations to sell their products; where women who dare to have a voice
are threatened
with rape and violent death; and where a young man felt justified in
carrying out an extreme
act of terrorism because of a woman's right to say ""No"", we believe it’s important to tell
women’s stories in order to normalise the female voice and to claim women’s
bodies for their own. 
By flipping the traditional story of
Beauty and the Beast on its head, Angela Carter begins to unpick the gender
norms represented in Charles Perrault’s original fairy tale, and the
limitations placed on both males and females by Western society. 
Marvellous Machine are proud to bring
this magnificent story to the stage.

<p>Dance... Visual Art... Murals... Photography... Film Making... Dreaming... and... Community Participation!<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span></p>
<p>The Sideshow Saturdays Project involves a series of
interdisciplinary events at Goldenflower Tai Chi Studio in
Winston-Salem, NC. During the months of June, July and August, Sideshow
Saturdays invites audience members to step into a performance installation or
creative project that weaves together dance and movement with various arts
mediums including photography, visual art, music, and even dreaming. Audience
participation may vary according to each project and relative to audience
member interests; however, everyone present co-creates each event.</p>
We call our series of events Sideshow Saturdays
because they take place in tandem with an already existing event, Summer On
Trade – a street concert every Saturday evening in the heart of downtown
Winston-Salem. Not only will the hundreds of audience members who gather for
Summer on Trade enjoy listening to great music, Sideshow Saturdays offers everyone
an opportunity to explore their own creativity through a variety of artistic
projects and performance installations.<br/>

<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>About Event Director/Choreographer, <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Ashlee Ramsey...</span>
</h3>
</div>
<div>As a dance artist I am interested in the concepts of creative participation and co-creativity. I love to create dance-based performance art that offers audience members more than an opportunity to enjoy the artistry of someone else, but  also acknowledges audience member creativity, giving everyone present an opportunity to participate in a creative process. As the director of The Sideshow Saturdays Project I hope to broaden the term ""creative"" to refer not just to artists, but to all humans. Indeed, whether we realize it or not, as individuals and as a community, we make choices in our daily lives that play a part in creating the fabric of our living experience. It is my hope that audience members will come away from each Sideshow Saturdays event with a deeper appreciation of their own involvement in life not as a silent spectator but as an active and valuable participant. </div>
<div>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Why The Sideshow Saturdays Project Is Important...</h3>
<p>The Sideshow Saturdays Project benefits local and regional
artists, enriches Summer on Trade audience member experiences and strengthens the
Winston-Salem community. Not only do involved artists receive a platform to
share their work with potentially hundreds of audience members, but Sideshow
Saturdays offers audience members a variety of sources for creative exploration
and expression. Each event in the Sideshow Saturdays Project helps to foster an
evening where audience members do not just arrive and enjoy the show, they have the
choice to engage more deeply through participation or immersion. The Sideshow
Saturdays Project exemplifies and progresses Winston Salem’s new slogan of “The
City of Arts and Innovation” – it’s not just what we have here, it’s what we
do. </p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Where The Money Goes...</h3>
Supporting
the Sideshow Saturdays Project means helping to create an event where community
members receive an opportunity to encounter their inherent artistry and
discover new outlets of creative expression, all the while building
relationships with and learning from one another. Your donation will go towards
the many expenses needed to make this project happen with success. Funding will
be allocated towards the materials and supplies needed for each event, the cost
of running the space for the evening, publicity and artist pay. Free to the
public and focused on community inclusion, Sideshow Saturdays has very little
outside income and we need your help!<br/>

<p><b>Imagination Installations </b>- Imagination Installations, an organization dedicated to
dreaming, will work with a group of dancers who engage audience members in activities
that help them bring their dreams to life through movement. Using Imagination
Installations’ process of gathering participant dream statements – sentences
that start with “Imagine When...” and finish with dreams for the future –
Ashlee Ramsey and fellow dancers will engage audience members in art and dance
projects that move their “Imagine When...” statements beyond words. <i>Imagine when all individuals feel free to
explore their creativity through many mediums of expression!</i></p>
<p><b>Courtney Belle Branch and Ashlee Ramsey</b> - Visual artist and film maker Courtney Branch along with
dance artist Ashlee Ramsey are collaborating on an evening that offers audience
members an interdisciplinary approach to creative investigation and
co-creativity utilizing visual art, dance and film. Under the guidance of Courtney,
participants have the opportunity to create smaller works of visual art that
are then compiled into a larger mural. With direction from Ashlee, participants
will engage in movement activities that translate their work of art into a
short dance phrase. Just as the works of visual art are compiled into a group
mural, these dance phrases will be filmed and channeled into a culminating
video project that serves to both document the creative process and to weave
together participants’ creative contribution. Using several mediums of artistic
exploration, Courtney and Ashlee hope to offer participants multiple avenues
for encountering and engaging in creative exploration and discovery. At the
same time this event promotes connection and co-creativity, encouraging
audience members to recognize how personal creative investment and local
involvement contributes to a greater mural of relationships within a community.

<p><b>Emily Morgan</b> - Choreographer, Winthrop University faculty member and

both the creative process of dance-making and their inherent, perhaps yet
discovered, choreographic abilities! </p>
<p><b>Steve Clarke</b> - Photographer and filmmaker Steve Clarke will present a
performance installation that involves a dancer (Jessi Knight) interacting with
video images over which she will have some degree of control.  The images may include projected shadows,
mirroring with live camera feed, and archival video serving as the dancer’s
only source of light.  In our society
today, images are easily made and widely disseminated.  This piece will explore the split between who
we are in images and who we are in reality, seeking to pierce the barrier
between these two aspects of the person. 
</p>
<p><b>Brianna Taylor</b> - Dance artist Brianna Taylor, director of Greensboro based <i>Confluence Performance Projects</i>, will
facilitate a performance installation experience utilizing movement, sound and
saran wrap. Members of the also Greensboro-based experimental music/art
ensemble <i>Collapss</i> will contribute a
soundscape based on an improvisational score, constantly shifting in relation
to participants’ choices. Audience members are invited to join dancers and
musicians in movement, sound making, as well as saran wrapping the space/objects/each
other, offering a visual and tactile representation of the interconnectedness
of the human experience.</p>
<p>And that's not all... our group of creative partners is growing! Stay tuned to our updates to learn when we add new artists and events to our project. (Just a sneak peak at future possibilities... think Indian classical dance... and there is buzz about tarot card readings involving a special dance performance and the opportunity to create your own spirit card using a collage technique... burgeoning ideas are so exciting!) </p>

soundscape based on an improvisational score, constantly shifting in relation
to participants’ choices. Audience members are invited to join dancers and
musicians in movement, sound making, as well as saran wrapping the space/objects/each
other, offering a visual and tactile representation of the interconnectedness
of the human experience.
And that's not all... our group of creative partners is growing! Stay tuned to our updates to learn when we add new artists and events to our project. (Just a sneak peak at future possibilities... think Indian classical dance... and there is buzz about tarot card readings involving a special dance performance and the opportunity to create your own spirit card using a collage technique... burgeoning ideas are so exciting!) 

Thank You!!

Thank you so much for checking out our Indiegogo Campaign. Please do consider supporting this project, either through a monetary contribution or by coming to an event... we would love to see you there!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

</h3>
<p>We are Mikaela Clark and Mackenzie Valley- dancers, choreographers, freedom-fighters.  Our journey, though not it's beginning, really took off in 2009 when we were struck with the reality of modern day slavery, specifically the global sex trade.  As artists, we felt compelled to do something: learn more about the issue and create dance about it. That was just the beginning. Since then, we created <b>Without Words Movement.</b>  Our mission:  <i>reclaiming freedom through dance. </i></p>
<p>We believe dance has a way of speaking to people- of passing the intellect and going straight to the heart and emotions.   Like many forms of art, it can challenge us, inspire us, touch us and even move us to look at the world differently.  This is why we create.  We strive to create high-quality dance performance, speaking on issues of social justice and the need for freedom in every human heart.  The other way we reclaim freedom through dance is to give others the opportunity to express themselves through dance.  <span style="""">Our work has taken us, outside of Cleveland OH to South East Asia, Romania and Italy. </span></p>

<p><span style="""">We have now been invited to <b>Malawi, Africa</b> to partner with Ancient Path.  There is a group of children in Malawi, who are not only getting food to eat and help to go to school, but the opportunity to grow through the arts.  These young children, many orphaned or at risk, come alive when they have an opportunity to dance, we are told.  It gives us great joy to share dance with these precious lives, hopefully leaving them with a sense of empowerment and greater freedom.  Not only that, but we truly believe this is an opportunity to see and hear from those who are otherwise  unseen.  These children represent the many children, all over the world who have no voice, yet they have something to say.  We want to go, listen and to come back to Cleveland better inspired and equipped to be a voice.  </span></p>

The Campaign
We have now been invited to Malawi, Africa to partner with Ancient Path.  There is a group of children in Malawi, who are not only getting food to eat and help to go to school, but the opportunity to grow through the arts.  These young children, many orphaned or at risk, come alive when they have an opportunity to dance, we are told.  It gives us great joy to share dance with these precious lives, hopefully leaving them with a sense of empowerment and greater freedom.  Not only that, but we truly believe this is an opportunity to see and hear from those who are otherwise  unseen.  These children represent the many children, all over the world who have no voice, yet they have something to say.  We want to go, listen and to come back to Cleveland better inspired and equipped to be a voice.  
The impact: 
1. Bring joy and empowerment to these children in Malawi, who deserve to live a life beyond just survival.  
2. Research the face of human trafficking in this region.
3.  Create new work upon returning to Cleveland.

Our goal is to raise: $8,500 
This covers all of our travel expenses: plane tickets, hotel, food, shots, etc.  It will also help cover any cost of living that we need while we are gone.
We also will be collecting fabric while we are there to create unique merchandise when we return. (Please see our ReClaim site for what we did returning from Europe).

</h3> <p></p>
<a href=""http://www.accidentalshakespeare.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Accidental Shakespeare Company</a>
 is a classical theater company in Chicago. The Accidentals want to 
bring a high level of dramaturgy and acting skills to an affordable 
storefront theater space. We are raising money for our second main stage 
show, <i>Macbeth</i>. We are raising the funds to cover the production 
costs so that we can maintain a very affordable ticket price for all.<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>The Production</h3>
<p>One of Shakespeare's greatest plays, <i>Macbeth</i> tells the story of the treacherous rise and bloody fall of the King of Scotland. Informed by a trio of witches that he is destined to become King, Macbeth and his wife go to greater and greater lengths to attain and to hold onto this goal.</p>
<p>The costumes, scenic elements, and aesthetic tone of this production will be informed by the 2002-era Bush administration White House. 2002 was a time in which even Bush's critics had not yet realized the lengths to which he would go, or the mess which he would leave behind. It was a time in which loyalty was paramount, and questioning authority was considered ""unpatriotic"". It was a time in which authority very badly needed to be questioned.<br/></p>
<h3>The Characters <br/>
</h3>
</div>Lord and Lady Macbeth (Andrew Mehegan and Sherry Legare) are the titular power couple, with her steel backbone keeping her less-grounded husband on track and his disconnection from reality driving them further into the darkness than she would have gone on her own.<br/><br/>Director Angeli Primlani specializes in examining theatrical works through the eyes of the ""minor"" characters who are thrust in the middle. For this production her point of view character is Ross (Rocco Renda), a minor nobleman in Duncan's court. Ross begins the play as a loyal friend to Macbeth, and a member of the inner circle, but ultimately his eyes are opened to his true nature.<br/><br/><h2>Finances</h2>We have already raised the funds for the performance space (the Side Project Theatre, at 1439 W. Jarvis) and we have finalized the (extremely talented!) cast. So there will definitely be a production of <i>Macbeth</i> in October! However, in order to bring this vision fully to the stage, we need your help. Specifically, there are four areas that need funding:<br/><b><br/></b><h3><b>The Production Team<br/></b></h3>Accidental Shakespeare is fortunate enough to have some extremely talented artists on board for this production, but as excited as they are to work with us they still need to pay their rent.<br/><br/><p><b></b>This production is not just ""<i>Macbeth</i> in modern dress"", but rather 
""<i>Macbeth</i>, as influenced by a very specific time and place in American 
History"", and for that we need someone who is equally creative and talented. We need someone who won't have to rely on the usual creepy makeup and 
spooky clothing, but will be able to produce the same chilling effect with 
business suits and enamel tie pins.<b> Kate Kamphausen</b> is a Jeff-Award-winning Chicago costume designer... and she's really great! </p><p>One of the key elements of this production is that in the first 
two-thirds of the play although there is a great deal of violence, it is
 remote, removed, and sterile. It all comes home to roost by the end, 
however, and only a veteran choreographer can make the savage, brutal 
retribution that we need be safe for the actors and entertaining to the 
audience. The man for this job is <b>H. Russ Brown</b>,<b> </b>an SAFD Certified Teacher and Advanced 
Actor Combatant who is currently serving as Head of Performance and an 
Assistant Professor at Lon Morris College. <br/></p><br/><h3><b>Set Construction</b></h3>The second major area that needs funding is our set design. Although we plan to have a simple set for the most part, it must be absolutely sturdy. The safety of our actors is one of our greatest concerns, and for a physically active production like this one, it is vital that they feel secure. And we want H. Russ Brown to feel free to have our actors jump on tables and dive over chairs, which means that everything on stage must be firm and durable.<br/><br/><h3>Publicity</h3>Finally, we need money for publicity. We know how great the production will be, and you know that it's going to be fantastic, but the rest of Chicago is still ignorant! Posters, fliers, advertisements, and celebrity endorsements aren't cheap, but it no one knows about the show, they (literally!) won't know what they're missing.<br/><br/><h3>Prices</h3><p>We as a company are committed to low ticket costs, so that people who
 cannot afford the high ticket prices of many Chicago theaters will be 
able to come to our show. This means that we cannot count on paying for our productions via ticket sales alone!<br/></p><h2>If you are unable to contribute financially, you can still help:

The costumes, scenic elements, and aesthetic tone of this production will be informed by the 2002-era Bush administration White House. 2002 was a time in which even Bush's critics had not yet realized the lengths to which he would go, or the mess which he would leave behind. It was a time in which loyalty was paramount, and questioning authority was considered ""unpatriotic"". It was a time in which authority very badly needed to be questioned.
The Characters 

Lord and Lady Macbeth (Andrew Mehegan and Sherry Legare) are the titular power couple, with her steel backbone keeping her less-grounded husband on track and his disconnection from reality driving them further into the darkness than she would have gone on her own.Director Angeli Primlani specializes in examining theatrical works through the eyes of the ""minor"" characters who are thrust in the middle. For this production her point of view character is Ross (Rocco Renda), a minor nobleman in Duncan's court. Ross begins the play as a loyal friend to Macbeth, and a member of the inner circle, but ultimately his eyes are opened to his true nature.FinancesWe have already raised the funds for the performance space (the Side Project Theatre, at 1439 W. Jarvis) and we have finalized the (extremely talented!) cast. So there will definitely be a production of Macbeth in October! However, in order to bring this vision fully to the stage, we need your help. Specifically, there are four areas that need funding:The Production TeamAccidental Shakespeare is fortunate enough to have some extremely talented artists on board for this production, but as excited as they are to work with us they still need to pay their rent.This production is not just ""Macbeth in modern dress"", but rather 
""Macbeth, as influenced by a very specific time and place in American 
History"", and for that we need someone who is equally creative and talented. We need someone who won't have to rely on the usual creepy makeup and 
spooky clothing, but will be able to produce the same chilling effect with 
business suits and enamel tie pins. Kate Kamphausen is a Jeff-Award-winning Chicago costume designer... and she's really great! One of the key elements of this production is that in the first 
two-thirds of the play although there is a great deal of violence, it is
 remote, removed, and sterile. It all comes home to roost by the end, 
however, and only a veteran choreographer can make the savage, brutal 
retribution that we need be safe for the actors and entertaining to the 
audience. The man for this job is H. Russ Brown, an SAFD Certified Teacher and Advanced 
Actor Combatant who is currently serving as Head of Performance and an 
Assistant Professor at Lon Morris College. Set ConstructionThe second major area that needs funding is our set design. Although we plan to have a simple set for the most part, it must be absolutely sturdy. The safety of our actors is one of our greatest concerns, and for a physically active production like this one, it is vital that they feel secure. And we want H. Russ Brown to feel free to have our actors jump on tables and dive over chairs, which means that everything on stage must be firm and durable.PublicityFinally, we need money for publicity. We know how great the production will be, and you know that it's going to be fantastic, but the rest of Chicago is still ignorant! Posters, fliers, advertisements, and celebrity endorsements aren't cheap, but it no one knows about the show, they (literally!) won't know what they're missing.PricesWe as a company are committed to low ticket costs, so that people who
 cannot afford the high ticket prices of many Chicago theaters will be 
able to come to our show. This means that we cannot count on paying for our productions via ticket sales alone!If you are unable to contribute financially, you can still help:

<h3>Help--I'm poor.</h3>
<p>Wuz ha'nin hoes?! It's your local neighborhood De De T and this year I'll be recording and producing my very first comedy album, <i>We're All Gonna Die, </i>on 9/30/2018 in New Orleans. In stand-up any comic worth her weight in pens and notebooks knows that even the best bits have to be laid to rest in order to transition to the next phase of creative growth. While I may have an unhealthy attachment to the material I composed in my comedic infancy, they're old now. This album represents a body of work that's been over 5 years in the making and it's time for these bits to die already. For the sake of closure (and diva-like dramatic display) I'm going to formally eulogize these jokes that I once loved in the most dignified way possible--with a dumb, concept-driven comedy special.</p>
<h3>Hey De De, why this macabre funeral business?</h3>
<p>My sense of humor has always been pretty dark and irreverent (much to the embarrassment of my parents). It was how I dealt with my fear, anger, insecurity, vulnerability and general discomfort in social settings. Even as a kid, somehow I knew that the only appropriate outlet for it was stand-up comedy. Turns out I was right. </p>
<p>The subject matter of this album (death, depression, gun violence, racism, etc.) is not intended for shock value (or to embarrass my folks). My brashness is but a vehicle to make people laugh at some of the things that scare us most in an effort to empower us to face them. </p>
<p>On a more personal note, even though comedy writing is more than mere free therapy to me, I can't help but notice how liberating it feels to drag my fears out in the open and make fun of them. At the moment what I'm most afraid of is this album. My fear is that if I get rid of this material that I'm really proud of (and took a LONG time to stitch together), I won't be able to duplicate it's singularity with the next 30/45/60 minutes I write. I'm afraid that by putting myself out there, I'll find out the hard way that what I thought was a really good set kinda sucks. I'm afraid that this will be a failure and I will have wasted all my efforts of over half a decade. Hell, I'm afraid that it'll be successful and then people will push me in to the spotlight when I am MUCH more comfortable in the shadows. All these fears are exactly why I'm compelled to take my chances.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>*List of Demands*</h3>
<p>My primary expense is that of production. I have to pay my sound engineer, videographer and editor for their work and that will cost $400</p>
<p>An equally important expense is that of paying the comics who have been gracious enough to perform on my show. My main gripe in stand-up comedy has always been that it is SO hard to get compensated for the work one puts in to the craft, and I would be remiss if I didn't pay my peers who have agreed to bring their talents to my project. They deserve way more than I can offer but I do want to give them something. Their total compensation will be $400.</p>
<p>I have to get asses in the seats so that will require promotional funding for photos, graphic design and ad boosting on various social media platforms in the amount of $165</p>
<p>And, of course, there is the final expense of digital audio distribution at $35.</p>
<h3>BRIBES. DELICIOUS BRIBES.</h3>
<p>If you donate $10 you get 2 tickets* to the show (if local) AND access to an advanced free digital download of the album.</p>
<p>If you donate $25-49 you get everything in the $10 pkg AND reserved seating at the show (if local), and a personalized, signed copy of the <i>It's Funny Because It's Inevitable</i> funeral program that includes photos from the album shoot, the line-up, an obituary and more.</p>
<p>If you donate $50-99 you get the $25 pkg AND a digital copy of the filmed performance with bonus features not included on the digital album.</p>
<p>If you donate $100-199 you get the $50 pkg AND you get named as an honorary pallbearer in the program, a special thank you on the album and in the film credits.</p>
<p>If you donate $200+ you get the $100 pkg (except you're an official pallbearer) AND you get executive producer credit on the album and in the film credits </p>
<p>*Seating is limited of course, so when I run out of seats I can no longer offer tickets with the perks.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What if you fail?</h3>
<p>If I'm not able to amass the necessary funds by the intended recording date of 9/30/18 then everything will be pushed back until I can. That includes the performance, album release date and distribution of certain backer incentives but this show will ABSOLUTELY go on and all the incentives will be fulfilled.</p>
<p>I know we got this though. So no worries, love. *wink*</p>
</div><div>
<h3>""Sis, I'd sit up witcha but I'm sick myself...""</h3>
<p>If you want to help me get this figurative homegoing ceremony popping, but you don't have the funds to do so, nobody understands that more than ol De De T. You can still do me a HUGE favor by sharing this on your IG, Twitter, Facebook, Google+, whatever. I'm grateful for any support you choose to give. Thank you!</p>

<p><strong>How your donation helps</strong></p>
<p>Your donations will help us afford our venue and equipment rentals, as well as the materials necessary to build our production, and pay our team. As part of our senior project we saw this project, not only as an opportunity to produce a fully realized piece showcasing our own abilities, but as an opportunity to offer our director and designers a platform to present their talents on a professional stage. The Drake Theatre is a professional venue, which plays host to a variety of local Philadelphia theatre companies. While we could have performed this show at one of the venues on Drexel’s campus, we felt that a center city venue, like the Drake, gave our team the best opportunity to show the Philadelphia theatre community their skills in each of their respective departments.</p>

How your donation helps
Your donations will help us afford our venue and equipment rentals, as well as the materials necessary to build our production, and pay our team. As part of our senior project we saw this project, not only as an opportunity to produce a fully realized piece showcasing our own abilities, but as an opportunity to offer our director and designers a platform to present their talents on a professional stage. The Drake Theatre is a professional venue, which plays host to a variety of local Philadelphia theatre companies. While we could have performed this show at one of the venues on Drexel’s campus, we felt that a center city venue, like the Drake, gave our team the best opportunity to show the Philadelphia theatre community their skills in each of their respective departments.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Dia dhuit/Halito/Hi, </h3>
<p>Colm Summers and LeAnne Howe here, we are a Choctaw-Irish writing and directing team. Together, we have written a new play,<i> The Keening</i> about the 174 year relationship between LeAnne's people, the Choctaw Nation, and Colm's folks in Co. Cork, Republic of Ireland. </p>
<p><strong>What is the Keening?</strong></p>
<p>174 years ago, the Choctaw sent a $170 gift to the Irish in the worst year of the Great Famine, known as Black '47, beginning a generations long reciprocity. The story of the Choctaw gift at the height of the Irish Famine has touched the imaginations of people around the world. Our play, <i>The Keening</i>, travels time and space to tell the story of how the Choctaws saved themselves from annihilation by saving the Irish from starvation. </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>But how does it feel?</b></span></p>

<p>In an increasingly atomized era of isolation and factionalism, our play is a call not only for intercultural generosity, but more nuanced cultural histories, which invites its audience to celebrate the gifts we can give each other if we imagine that we are all kindred spirits. </p>
<p><strong>Our goal:</strong> In the next 2-5 years, <i>The Keening</i> will tour transatlantically bringing our story to Irish and American audiences.  To get there, we are asking you to contribute to the play's development, specifically this August at Irish Arts Centre in New York, where we will be developing the play! That means taking the play from one draft, to another, with actors, live and in-person! </p>
