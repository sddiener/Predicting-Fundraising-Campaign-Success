<p> The Contractors is an immersive, grand-scale role-playing game set in a war-torn future of super-soldiers, giant mechs, and vanishing humanity.</p>
<p>Because of its size, we’re developing the game in stages. For this fund goal, we are focusing on:</p>
<p>Finalized concept art for environments, characters, vehicles, and weapons</p>
<p>Establishing a forum-equipped website for our supporters and hosting it for a year</p>

<p>Our Vision</p>
<p>Think about the games you love and what you love most about them.</p>
<p>Is it driving around a huge cityscape in a sweet ride of your choosing, whether it’s got four wheels or spinning blades, chasing glory while sunset eases in the night?</p>
<p>Is it the adrenaline rush of raining gunfire as you tactically take out waves of enemy soldiers with a kick-ass arsenal of weapons you’ve level grinding to obtain?</p>
<p>Is it mastering the skills and upgrades of your multi-class character as you send them through an epic, seamless, and reactive story?</p>
<p>Well, we love all those things, too. That’s why we want to fuse together all the best parts of all our favorite games and make something awesome – and we want to bring you in on it. We understand that’s an ambitious goal. We’re an ambitious people. But we’re also being realistic about it.</p>
<p>Building something like this is going to take time, a clear and flexible plan, and lots of hard work. So, we’re planning to get the engine running one phase at a time.</p>
<p>We’re hoping you’ll join us while we realise our dream game. It’s still early days, but if you stick with us, your ideas can become a reality too.</p>
<p>The Story</p>
<p>In The Contractors, the world has advanced through unimaginable technological marvels in the game of war. So much so, that our drives of greed and ambition ran unencumbered by limitation and consumed the world like a wildfire. Now we are spared one thing: desperation.</p>
<p>We’ve come full circle. It’s a dog-eat-dog world but instead of claws and fangs, we have guns loaded with more ammo than there are human lives left.</p>
<p>The cities are hollow. Our armies draw strength from living steel. In some measures, machines are the dominant species of the world’s ravaged ecosystem, and the masters they answer to are ones who will never stop fighting.</p>
<p>Because, after all, isn’t there always something to fight for?</p>

<p>Rewards and Perks</p>
<p>One of the unique aspects of our crowdfunding efforts is including any potential backer into the development process. Have you ever wanted to design a weapon or vehicle, and then see it fully realised in a game? Well this is your chance!</p>
<p>For a limited number of backers at certain reward tiers, we’re offering a chance to work together with our art team to design a custom exclusive skin for a weapon, vehicle, or character (whichever you choose) which will then be posted in our game store.</p>
<p>We’ve made this opportunity exclusive to some of the higher-end reward tiers. Please see our reward perks for more details.</p>
<p>Other Ways You Can Help</p>
<p>Whether you can contribute as a backer or not, you can always help by sharing the game with people you know. So please don’t hesitate to spread the word if you want to see the game get made!

The Story
In The Contractors, the world has advanced through unimaginable technological marvels in the game of war. So much so, that our drives of greed and ambition ran unencumbered by limitation and consumed the world like a wildfire. Now we are spared one thing: desperation.

We have decided to insert the bestiary because we will release free expansions that will increase the decisional paths available!! So we replaced that stretch goal as it has already been substantially achieved!The Ballad Singer is an RPG/Visual Novel, set in a fantasy world which is completely governed by the player's choices. After being the most funded Italian video game on Kickstarter ever, TBS is now on Indiegogo!We've taken elements from game-books and visual novels to develop a videogame with an unprecedented format. TBS offers a fantasy story yet to be written, where the world changes and reacts to the player's actions. This will allow you to live up to 1700 stories and 40 different endings, your decisions will affect the way the tale unfolds. Every single development and subplot in your story will be completely narrated and illustrated, even the smallest ones. Death is final, you won't be able to go back to try and correct your mistakes. In TBS, every choice is crucial.Pre-Alpha footage gameplay video   The Domino System is what allows you to live thousands of different narratives within The Ballad Singer. The paths will change according to your actions, the characters you have selected, and their progress or failures. The system is inspired by Neural Networks and Chaos Theory. Each choice you'll make will influence the options at your disposal, not just for the character you'll be using in that moment, but also for the others.Upon the death of one hero, you’ll begin playing with another adventurer, in a world that has been completely reshaped by the previous choices. In the single player campaign, you'll play as one of the four main characters, following their adventures in the world of Hesperia.The main elements considered by the Domino System are the selected character and the decisions you'll be taking. The heroes are four different adventurers, each with their own features. You will shape their fate, through your actions. Each decision unfolds a new page in your story, told by the narrating voice and depicted by the illustrations. Surviving will be hard, anticipating the repercussions of your choices on the other side of the world will be almost impossible. By killing the dragon, will Leon have saved the town from its fury? Or has he shifted the whole balance of the region? If Leon were to die in the fight, would he condemn the whole country? Could the dragon favor one of the factions? Over your ballad, you'll be able to play with up to four adventurers, each with his or her own goals and limits. Some much stronger than others. They don't know it, but their own individual destiny is in the hands of each other. Through your decisions you'll be able to favor or compromise the aspirations of the other adventures and of the entire world of Hesperia!Our goal is ambitious: to rearrange the fundamentals of the Fantasy genre, creating something completely new. The world of Hesperia is a fantastic yet realistic universe, where the laws of science merge with those of magic.The magic system itself, the enemies, and the monsters are all treated individually, each match has been studied to be different: you will never find the same situation twice or a ""default"" method to approach fights.Each match will be potentially lethal if not approached with caution. Magic is based on the control of natural elements, but it is rare and hard to master. Magical objects are legends, and wizards themselves need to wear armor, as melee fights come by often and can rarely be avoided.Hesperia is a cruel world, merciless on unprepared adventurers. Don't trust anyone, use your instinct and your knowledge, this is the only way to survive and to continue your quest.  The RPG component in TBS is highly important. Only through a deep understanding of the characters and their abilities, just as with the story of the game world, will you be able to face the challenges of The Ballad Singer at your best, getting to the end of your tale. You'll often be called upon to make choices based on wit, strategy, and even ethics. Use your common sense, but don't forget the past of the characters and their ambitions. Each choice could change the aspect, the equipment, the morality and the psyche of our heroes. The characters are as dynamic as the world, and are reshaped with each choice.Playing without empathizing with the heroes, taking random decisions, will often result in their death. However, in The Ballad Singer, dying is part of the story, so it's not a ""Game Over"". When the character you're playing as dies, you will be able to play as a new hero, within the same story, in a different narrative path.Your ballad will be over only once you are out of available characters, either because they're dead, killed by your decisions, or simply because you haven't met them yet. This aspect shouldn’t be seen as a negative, as we've decided that each narrative path must have the same relevance.Playing through the game more than once is a paramount part of the experience, if faced without the fundamental premises of any Role-Playing Game, it will indeed result in a hard and perilous journey.The “My Ballad” mode lets you write your story in the world of Hesperia, starting by selecting one of the available characters. Throughout your adventure, depending on your choices, you will also have the chance to play as other heroes, moving towards final or intermediate endings, goals and failures, new tales or death. Once your campaign is over, a map will be displayed, showing the narrative paths you have taken, the characters you have played with, and the goals you have achieved, allowing you to share your experience with other The Ballad Singer players. Facing the ""Hot-seat"" campaign mode, you'll have the chance to share the experience with a friend, who will select a second character. You will begin the story with your hero and, upon death or the completion of a chapter, the second player will take his turn, making his way through the world of Hesperia with another adventurer. However, the world won't be the same, as it will have been influenced by his decisions and by those of the previous player! This mode opens a series of cooperative and competitive dynamics. Playing in competitive mode, a complex system of trophies and scores will decide the winner, while, opting for cooperation, once the game ends, the final results will display all your contributions! The ""Hot-seat"" mode is offline, and has been designed to give you the opportunity to share the story with a friend, taking turns.Music in TBS plays a fundamental role, all characters have their own soundtrack, just as every region and situation. These aspects have been thought out to make players experience every different combination of situations as a unique event. Two composers are working on the soundtrack: Michael Firmont and Gianluca Ferro. Beside working on a German TV series, Michael collaborates with several composers, directors and producers in Los Angeles and London and has written music for different international movies and projects. Gianluca is a talented composer and guitar player, and has published several records. His last one, ""A Hole in the Ocean"", came out in 2016. Listen to the first tracks of the soundtrack:The Ballad Singer Original Score  A feature you'll find particularly useful when on the move, unwilling to leave the adventure behind, is the cross-platform integration for TBS! After the Windows/Mac versions, and any other reached through our stretch goals, we intend to release a mobile version of the game. You'll be able to use the Cross-platform saving system though all the versions!We've put together an extremely valuable set of reward packages for our backers.

<h3>Hello!</h3>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://slashwareint.com/ananias/igg/slash.png"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/><p>
	I'm Santiago Zapata, a game developer who loves developing turn based computer
	roleplaying games. You can see my work at <a href=""http://slashwareint.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://slashwareint.com</a>
</p>
<p>Some months ago I started developing a game with an idea in my mind: I wanted to 
make people being able to experience the fun of a roguelike / dungeon crawler game, without
the high entry barrier currently created by outdated and overly complex interfaces, and I wanted them
to be able to do it from their smartphones and other portable devices. I had been looking for a game like
that and could never find it, it was time to create it!.</p>
<p>I set into that journey of development, and today I can say the foundations are laid out, but I think it's time to take it to another level... 
I'm launching this campaign because with your help, I'll be able to make the game even more accessible, fun and 
	artistically pleasing, so that it can be enjoyed by a lot of people in the world.</p>
<p>
	There's an existing playable version available at <a href=""http://slashwareint.com/ananias"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://slashwareint.com/ananias</a>;
	this campaign seeks to complete the game by implementing new cool features, polishing the game experience immensely, and making
	it available to all major platforms HTML5 based development allows.

<h3>What does this game play like?</h3>
<p>Gameplay is designed to be simple and fun; just after tapping on the title screen you
will find yourself into the game. Your goal is to survive about 25 levels, and fetch
an ancient artifact located at the end.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://slashwareint.com/ananias/igg/ananiasPreview.1.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The levels in the dungeon are randomly generated every time you play, so you have
to explore the level gathering useful equipment and looking the stairs to the next level, 
while avoiding death and managing your limited resources.</p>
<ul>
<li>...will you drop your spare weapon and carry this potion with you, knowing it could be useful on the next level?</li>
<li>...will you risk attacking a group of enemies to fetch that powerful armor that could save your life? or will you better run away to save your hitponts</li>
<li>...will you withstand the enemy attacks to reach the backrow and kill the fairy who is constantly healing all others?</li>
<li>...will you carry with you that powerful weapon to use it against strong enemies two levels below, even if that means using up inventory space and attacking with a weaker weapon?</li>
</ul><p>The odds are against you, but if you die there's always a chance to start again and wish for better fortune</p>
<h3>There are a lot of mobile roguelikes out there... what makes
	this one different?</h3>
<p>Ananias is designed from the ground up with the idea of a
	straightforward user experience for a touch screen device; interactions
	are optimized so you don't have to waste time with cumbersome movement,
	while still allowing you to explore the dungeon and fight the dwellers
	of the dungeon.</p>
<p>A simple gameplay is also a strong design focus; the game is designed
for you to be able to do quick playthroughs, trying to delve deeper into
the dungeon every time. 
</p><p>There are 28 enemy types, each with an unique feature that makes him
	stand apart from the rest. We are favoring uniqueness versus quantity in the monster design. Let me show you some of them!</p>

<p>The original campaign we had launched was not successful, we have adjusted the project hoping to be able to still make this come to life!</p>
<p>We are looking forward for 1499 USD, with this money we will able

Hello!

	I'm Santiago Zapata, a game developer who loves developing turn based computer
	roleplaying games. You can see my work at http://slashwareint.com

Some months ago I started developing a game with an idea in my mind: I wanted to 
make people being able to experience the fun of a roguelike / dungeon crawler game, without
the high entry barrier currently created by outdated and overly complex interfaces, and I wanted them
to be able to do it from their smartphones and other portable devices. I had been looking for a game like
that and could never find it, it was time to create it!.
I set into that journey of development, and today I can say the foundations are laid out, but I think it's time to take it to another level... 
I'm launching this campaign because with your help, I'll be able to make the game even more accessible, fun and 
	artistically pleasing, so that it can be enjoyed by a lot of people in the world.

	There's an existing playable version available at http://slashwareint.com/ananias;
	this campaign seeks to complete the game by implementing new cool features, polishing the game experience immensely, and making
	it available to all major platforms HTML5 based development allows.


What does this game play like?
Gameplay is designed to be simple and fun; just after tapping on the title screen you
will find yourself into the game. Your goal is to survive about 25 levels, and fetch
an ancient artifact located at the end.


The levels in the dungeon are randomly generated every time you play, so you have
to explore the level gathering useful equipment and looking the stairs to the next level, 
while avoiding death and managing your limited resources.

...will you drop your spare weapon and carry this potion with you, knowing it could be useful on the next level?
...will you risk attacking a group of enemies to fetch that powerful armor that could save your life? or will you better run away to save your hitponts
...will you withstand the enemy attacks to reach the backrow and kill the fairy who is constantly healing all others?
...will you carry with you that powerful weapon to use it against strong enemies two levels below, even if that means using up inventory space and attacking with a weaker weapon?
The odds are against you, but if you die there's always a chance to start again and wish for better fortune
There are a lot of mobile roguelikes out there... what makes
	this one different?
Ananias is designed from the ground up with the idea of a
	straightforward user experience for a touch screen device; interactions
	are optimized so you don't have to waste time with cumbersome movement,
	while still allowing you to explore the dungeon and fight the dwellers
	of the dungeon.
A simple gameplay is also a strong design focus; the game is designed
for you to be able to do quick playthroughs, trying to delve deeper into
the dungeon every time. 
There are 28 enemy types, each with an unique feature that makes him
	stand apart from the rest. We are favoring uniqueness versus quantity in the monster design. Let me show you some of them!





Satyr: This mystical race inhabits the temple ruins, they move quickly so keep an eye on them!




Necromancer: These sorcerors meddle with the realms of the dead, they can summon undead servant to do their command




Fencer: Masters of the swords, they are able to easily disarm their enemies leaving them at their mercy




Demonspawn:This dark demonical race is able to warp next to their enemy giving them no chance to escape their doom


The game is being developed using the phaser.io library, one of
	quickest growing frameworks for HTML5 mobile development; it has great
	integration with CocoonJS, which in turn is capable of generating
	native packages for a lot of platforms.
What we need and what we'll do
The original campaign we had launched was not successful, we have adjusted the project hoping to be able to still make this come to life!
We are looking forward for 1499 USD, with this money we will able
	to include the following:
New environments

	The game currently has a single environment (The Temple Ruins); it needs a bit more variety to make it interesting
	for the players, there will also be optional branches the players can go through for further adventure and loot!



Following is the layout for the main dungeon:

Temple Ruins: Centuries ago it was as a place of worship, now it's overrun by monsters.
Cavern of Chaos: Located beneath the temple ruins, these caverns mark the entrance to the underworld.
Underground Lagoon: A giant subterranean water reservoir.
Crystal Caves: These dark depths are adorned by multicolored crystals, old as earth itself.
Darkness Abyss: Deep below the surface of the earth where all dead spirits rule.
Hell: The domains of the Draconians, a dark place devoid of all life.


Locations will also be made more interesting by adding special
	rooms and features spiced by awesome pixel art, as well as hidden
	artifacts to complement the plot. For this I'll continue working with the master pixel artist Denzi, whose work
	includes large contributions to the Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup graphics and many other projects.
I'll also add illustrations for the new locations, the player will see them once he gets there
Companion Monsters
Monsters you can train to aid you in your quest! There will be 3 different base 
	monsters with different abilities you can choose from the beginning, they will evolve into different monsters if you
	find special spells into the dungeon, gaining new skills.


Other Game Features

Short cutscenes, similar to the old Ultima Games, for the Intro, Game Over and Victory, to help immerse players into the game.
Minibosses, unique strong monsters, they'll pop up at the end of each section of the dungeon and will give out special rewards.
Allow saving games.
Add journey memorial screen resuming your accomplishments and allow sharing it.
Polished User Experience
One of the most important points will be to ensure the game is very easy to get into. I'll test thoroughly in as many devices 
and with as much people as possible.
This will probably require revamping the UI through several design iterations, and I'll also need assets to make that happen.

<p>Cars Incorporated is a tycoon game about <b>designing and selling your own cars</b>. It is an ongoing project that has <b>consistently been growing</b>, along with it's still small but dedicated fanbase, during the 19 versions released so far.<br/></p>
<p>Since the first early access version in late 2011 it has been available as a fully playable game that has been praised for it's already <b>solid gameplay</b> and it's <b>stability </b>by new and returning players over and over again.</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.cars-inc-game.com/images/screens/v03/splash1.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><p>It's<b> semi-freeform-body-editor</b>, it's <b>improvable and customizable engines</b>, along with it's fun to watch <b>simulated races</b> make <i>Cars Incorporated</i> a unique business simulation in the spirit of classic car builder games like <i>Detroit </i>(1993) and <i>Motor City</i> (1994).<br/></p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.cars-inc-game.com/images/screens/140622-01.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>The Achilles heel of the game so far has been the lack of funding which has slowed the development to a crawl but has never stopped it entirely - and never will, as we have been consistently pushing forward since 2011 (or 2010 if you count the time before the first release).<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.cars-inc-game.com/images/screens/140101-02.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>Since the introduction to Steam Greenlight we have experienced a rise in preorders, putting the financial requirements to get the development on the (fulltime) fast track almost within reach.<br/>The accompanying rise in feedback and suggestions is also making it necessary to spend more time on the project than we can currently afford due to the regular job of the main developer.<br/><br/><b>So we're asking you, our fans and supporters, as well as all you tycoon players that stumble accross this campaign to help us put the development onto the fast lane.</b><br/><br/><a name=""funding"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.cars-inc-game.com/images/promo/indie2fundE.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>Ever since the development of <i>Cars Incorporated</i> has started the graphics had a low priority as the focus was on the game mechanics. As a result <b>most of the graphics in the game now, are still considered placeholders</b>. <br/>The original plan was for version 0.60 - at a time when most of the mechanics will be in place and changes to the UI become less likely - to redo all the graphics and replace the backgrounds with graphics rendered in Blender 3D.<br/>But all the feedback we received in these past months has made it very clear to us that even now, with the game somewhere in the middle of development, and even in a genre that has classically been less focused on graphics, the looks make the sales.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.cars-inc-game.com/images/screens/140331-01.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>So the plan was changed and while we're finishing up the last incarnations of version 0.3x, the revised plans for version 0.40 call for a replacement of the GUI ahead of it's time to bring in all those great suggestions we have received and <b>make the game more appealing to people who stumble upon it</b>.<br/><br/>The new UI, that is currently in the planing stage will get rid of the 2D backdrops. Instead 3D scenes will take their places, making the game much more beautiful and the UI more flexible, especially with regards to the screen resolution, which will become configurable in v0.40.<br/>The menus, statistics and settings will be 2D overlays that contain all the game elements that do not require or do not work in 3D. These windows will be drag-able and most will be switchable between 3 sizes: mini-view, regular and an expanded view that will only work on larger resolutions.
<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.cars-inc-game.com/images/promo/evolve.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>The bottom line is that the new plan for version 0.40 will require a lot of 3D modelling work and quite some development time (especially if the previously planed features like achievements are to remain in the game at this point).<br/>With the current funds available these tasks can only be worked on in our spare time, as we need to make money to live. This results in the ongoing crawling speed, the development has been in since the project started.<br/>With your help we can change this and put the development on the fast track. <b>Hitting the inital goal will enable the game's developer to work full time on the game</b> for at least 2-3 months, which will make it possible to get all that work done and release version 0.40 1-2 months after the end of the campaign.<br/><br/><a name=""future"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.cars-inc-game.com/images/promo/indie3future.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>If the funding for version 0.40 can be secured, all the versions that follow will also profit from that, especially if the development speed can be kept up by rising sales or additional campaigns for v0.50+.<br/><br/>So here are some of the<b> corner points</b> for the next major versions of <i>Cars Incorporated</i>:<br/><br/>v0.3x (remaining)<br/>- revamped business simulation<br/>- a range of smaller improvements are still open<br/><br/>v0.4x<br/>- revamped User Interface with 3D backgrounds and 2D menues<br/>- selectable screen resolution<br/>- Achievements<br/><br/>v0.5x<br/>- Driving simulation (highly depends on the financing, will be dropped again if no fulltime work is possible by then)<br/>- body editor revamp<br/>- body generation 4<br/>- game time until 1970<br/><br/><a name=""referral"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.cars-inc-game.com/images/promo/indie2partE.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>Even without contributing to this campaign directly you can support Cars Incorporated by simply making people aware of it - I'm no marketing expert, in fact I pretty much have no idea of what I am doing in that regard - but <b>here's your chance to help <i>Cars Incorporated</i></b> with this. 
And for helping out you can even win the game in digital and boxed versions, T-Shirts, access to development steps between releases and you can even become a part of the game yourself.<br/><br/><p>All you have to do is use the tools provided by Indiegogo further up on this page to promote this campaign. If you are logged in when doing so Indiegogo can track how many people you send here. Just be sure to send them here, not to the game's homepage as that can not be counted by Indiegogo.</p>
<p>For each referral (unique visitor) you will receive 1 point. Every 
Euro contributed by one of your referrals (limited to those Indiegogo 
could track) will give you 5 points. The 5 highest ranking people at the
 end of the campaign will receive the following prices:</p>

<p>Will receive the Perk ""Be In The Game"" for free. This includes 
immediate alpha-access, an autographed boxed copy with your key once the

Cars Incorporated is a tycoon game about designing and selling your own cars. It is an ongoing project that has consistently been growing, along with it's still small but dedicated fanbase, during the 19 versions released so far.
Since the first early access version in late 2011 it has been available as a fully playable game that has been praised for it's already solid gameplay and it's stability by new and returning players over and over again.
It's semi-freeform-body-editor, it's improvable and customizable engines, along with it's fun to watch simulated races make Cars Incorporated a unique business simulation in the spirit of classic car builder games like Detroit (1993) and Motor City (1994).
The Achilles heel of the game so far has been the lack of funding which has slowed the development to a crawl but has never stopped it entirely - and never will, as we have been consistently pushing forward since 2011 (or 2010 if you count the time before the first release).Since the introduction to Steam Greenlight we have experienced a rise in preorders, putting the financial requirements to get the development on the (fulltime) fast track almost within reach.The accompanying rise in feedback and suggestions is also making it necessary to spend more time on the project than we can currently afford due to the regular job of the main developer.So we're asking you, our fans and supporters, as well as all you tycoon players that stumble accross this campaign to help us put the development onto the fast lane.Ever since the development of Cars Incorporated has started the graphics had a low priority as the focus was on the game mechanics. As a result most of the graphics in the game now, are still considered placeholders. The original plan was for version 0.60 - at a time when most of the mechanics will be in place and changes to the UI become less likely - to redo all the graphics and replace the backgrounds with graphics rendered in Blender 3D.But all the feedback we received in these past months has made it very clear to us that even now, with the game somewhere in the middle of development, and even in a genre that has classically been less focused on graphics, the looks make the sales.So the plan was changed and while we're finishing up the last incarnations of version 0.3x, the revised plans for version 0.40 call for a replacement of the GUI ahead of it's time to bring in all those great suggestions we have received and make the game more appealing to people who stumble upon it.The new UI, that is currently in the planing stage will get rid of the 2D backdrops. Instead 3D scenes will take their places, making the game much more beautiful and the UI more flexible, especially with regards to the screen resolution, which will become configurable in v0.40.The menus, statistics and settings will be 2D overlays that contain all the game elements that do not require or do not work in 3D. These windows will be drag-able and most will be switchable between 3 sizes: mini-view, regular and an expanded view that will only work on larger resolutions.
The bottom line is that the new plan for version 0.40 will require a lot of 3D modelling work and quite some development time (especially if the previously planed features like achievements are to remain in the game at this point).With the current funds available these tasks can only be worked on in our spare time, as we need to make money to live. This results in the ongoing crawling speed, the development has been in since the project started.With your help we can change this and put the development on the fast track. Hitting the inital goal will enable the game's developer to work full time on the game for at least 2-3 months, which will make it possible to get all that work done and release version 0.40 1-2 months after the end of the campaign.If the funding for version 0.40 can be secured, all the versions that follow will also profit from that, especially if the development speed can be kept up by rising sales or additional campaigns for v0.50+.So here are some of the corner points for the next major versions of Cars Incorporated:v0.3x (remaining)- revamped business simulation- a range of smaller improvements are still openv0.4x- revamped User Interface with 3D backgrounds and 2D menues- selectable screen resolution- Achievementsv0.5x- Driving simulation (highly depends on the financing, will be dropped again if no fulltime work is possible by then)- body editor revamp- body generation 4- game time until 1970Even without contributing to this campaign directly you can support Cars Incorporated by simply making people aware of it - I'm no marketing expert, in fact I pretty much have no idea of what I am doing in that regard - but here's your chance to help Cars Incorporated with this. 
And for helping out you can even win the game in digital and boxed versions, T-Shirts, access to development steps between releases and you can even become a part of the game yourself.All you have to do is use the tools provided by Indiegogo further up on this page to promote this campaign. If you are logged in when doing so Indiegogo can track how many people you send here. Just be sure to send them here, not to the game's homepage as that can not be counted by Indiegogo.
For each referral (unique visitor) you will receive 1 point. Every 
Euro contributed by one of your referrals (limited to those Indiegogo 
could track) will give you 5 points. The 5 highest ranking people at the
 end of the campaign will receive the following prices:

<h3>Hi folks!</h3>
<p>We are Andreas (27) and Sebastian (26), two enthusiastic gamers from Germany, who always dreamt about making games of our own. This dream can become reality with your help! </p>
<p>Both of us have the skillsets to bring a game to life, programming and 3D-modeling as well as drawing, a musical background and voice acting. We each acted on our own before but now we will combine our skills to bring you awesome games. </p>
<p>Sebastian's working as a Software Engineer for a local company and has always enjoyed 3D modelling and was interrested in game development as a whole.</p>
<p>Andreas is currently studying Media IT at the local Universtiy of applied sciences. He draws and scribbles on every piece of paper he can find and has learned to play the violin and guitar.</p>
<p>Both of us enjoy singing (at home and at karaoke events) acting and voiceacting.</p>
<p>Funding our project will enable us to put our skills to use with the appropriate software and bring you many hours of joy and excitement.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We need a commercial and a team license for the game engine, that´s where most of the raised money will be spent on (Unity).</p>
<p>Further on we need a license for audio software to compose (FruityLoops) for recording and editing we will use Audacity, because it´s free for commercial use, and about 699$ for image editing software (Photoshop), for 3D modeling and sculpting we use Sculptris and Blender, that´s because there both free to use even for commercial purposes and possess the needed functionality that we need.</p>
<p>If we are not able to release a game within two to three years the remaining funds will go to charity.</p>
<p>In case we will not reach our funding goal we will use the funds for most crucial software that we need to begin development.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>You will experience classic games with new and fresh ideas. We strive to enhance the potential of classic Amiga /  Atari / Commodore / PC Engine games. </p>
<p>Also the casual market is a wide open space for fresh and creative ideas, which we are eager to deliver and bring you games that are fun, challenging and will glue you to the screen. </p>
<p>Since we have a gaming experience for about 22 years, we've seen many brilliant and also many bad games. But even some bad games just had their potential thrown out the window. That potential and ideas we want to use and enhance them with our experience and creativity.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Always think about how even tiny amounts can help us achieve our goal and are very much appreciated. But if you don't have that tiny amount you can always spread the word about us. </p>

Andreas is currently studying Media IT at the local Universtiy of applied sciences. He draws and scribbles on every piece of paper he can find and has learned to play the violin and guitar.
Both of us enjoy singing (at home and at karaoke events) acting and voiceacting.
Funding our project will enable us to put our skills to use with the appropriate software and bring you many hours of joy and excitement.  
 
What We Need
We need a commercial and a team license for the game engine, that´s where most of the raised money will be spent on (Unity).
Further on we need a license for audio software to compose (FruityLoops) for recording and editing we will use Audacity, because it´s free for commercial use, and about 699$ for image editing software (Photoshop), for 3D modeling and sculpting we use Sculptris and Blender, that´s because there both free to use even for commercial purposes and possess the needed functionality that we need.
If we are not able to release a game within two to three years the remaining funds will go to charity.
In case we will not reach our funding goal we will use the funds for most crucial software that we need to begin development.
 


What You Get
You will experience classic games with new and fresh ideas. We strive to enhance the potential of classic Amiga /  Atari / Commodore / PC Engine games. 
Also the casual market is a wide open space for fresh and creative ideas, which we are eager to deliver and bring you games that are fun, challenging and will glue you to the screen. 
Since we have a gaming experience for about 22 years, we've seen many brilliant and also many bad games. But even some bad games just had their potential thrown out the window. That potential and ideas we want to use and enhance them with our experience and creativity.
 
Other Ways You Can Help


Always think about how even tiny amounts can help us achieve our goal and are very much appreciated. But if you don't have that tiny amount you can always spread the word about us.

<p>How much do I like this genre? When I saw Alone in the Dark game at a friend's house in 1994, I wanted to make a game like that. Then I saw Resident Evil 1 and 2 a few years later, then I really wanted to make videogames. I've tried working on Obscure when I knew it was in early development. I've spent a lot of money so I could keep on playing Resident Evil Outbreak.</p>
<p>In 2000 I begun working professionaly for: Mircroids, Electronic Arts &amp; Ubisoft.</p>
<p>Flashforward 2013, I still haven't worked on anything close to Resident Evil other than maybe Still Life (highly reccomended). I'm not going to sit idly by waiting for my game to happen anymore. I want to make my own game and keep the rights to it so that if there are sequels they will remain true to the original.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple characters to choose from with unique features and abilities.</li>
<li>All scenarios will be playable with online partners as an option</li>
<li>Walk and Shoot</li>
<li>Switch to over the shoulder cam any time you want to</li>
<li>Auto aim in 3D, switch targets from nearest to farthest</li>
<li>Dodging / Evasion moves to avoid being hit</li>
<li>Unlockable weak characters for extra challenge</li>

<li>Each character will talk</li>
<li>More to add soon</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Can I do all of this myself? YES I CAN.</p>
<p>I've spent the last 2 weeks learning programation, how to set up multiplayer, teaching myself animation, all things I had never done before. I've spent time building quick assets to get a rough idea of the game's look. The video sample right now isn't very scary and it's missing textures, the animations are very rough too. I've solved most of the features I am enunciating here, they aren't in the video because I didn't have time to animate the characters performing those actions yet. I mostly need to work on the art from now on.</p>
<p>I'm 100% confident I'll do this.</p>
<p>But I need your contribution so I can work on this full time. </p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">WHAT I NEED</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Money to cover my expenses for the entire year I will be working on this.</li>
<li>I would like to put a good sum into the audio recording and quality voice acting. Professional sounding audio with believable acting is crucial to me when playing a game.</li>
<li>People talking about the game to anyone who is interested in Survival horror games.</li>

<ul>
<li>If it's overfunded to the point I can afford assistants to handle building the game's environments and animation, I will do it. My plan for now is that I go on this project full tilt by myself.</li>
</ul><p>-If I don't reach my funding goal, I will still be working on this game, but it won't go as fast or be complete as it would be if I have to keep seeking contracts or working on other people's productions while doing this.

<p> </p>
<p>I'm asking for 100k right now and I will release a full game next year. I will try for more funding. Ideally, I would need 100-300k, which isn't much considering the average game production cost is 5 million dollars.</p>

<p>There’s
only so much we can do with sheer will alone, and although we are already in an
advanced development stage, there are costs associated with the publishing of
the game which we can’t afford, namely the Android license, the Apple Store
license, as well as a Mac OS X computer which is required to develop games for
the iOS platform.<br/>
In sum, your funds would go into the following:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Android
Licensing, as well as Android-powered devices for testing.</span><br/>

Codename
Blast is an infinite 2D space shooter which aims to deliver dynamic and
visually engaging space backdrops to complement a fun and challenging gameplay
experience.
The player
controls the “Explorer” spaceship. 
Faced with waves of asteroids, the player must destroy or evade them using his
shooting skills and dexterity.
Destroying asteroids grants you points, which can be affected by a multiplier that
is awarded depending on the amount of asteroids you destroy without being hit.
These asteroids break down into three categories:

 Normal/Gold
asteroids will reward the player with points for destroying them. Normal
asteroids give a base 10 points, while Gold asteroids reward the  player  with a
base 50 points.

 Asteroid
fields are composed by clusters of larger, indestructible asteroids which the
spaceship has to evade. The reward is variable depending on whether the player
successfully evades all asteroids with no damage. Hitting an asteroid nullifies
the multiplier.



 
Meteors
are sudden high-speed asteroid fragments which the player has to dodge after an
indicator appears on the edge of the screen.


The
spaceship can also collect power-ups which grant different bonuses to the
player.
Some of the power-ups are:


  Speed
burst, which boosts the spaceship to maximum speed while giving it a temporary
indestructible state.



 Health/Shield
replenishers, which restore some of the spaceship’s hull/shield.

· 


 Fire
burst, which grants you infinite ammo for a limited time which is shot at a
much higher and automatic rate.



 Ship
upgrades, which grant you new weapons (such as additional turrets), hull
upgrades, etc.


The game
will feature social integration such as Leaderboards (for Points and Distance),
Achievements, as well as the ability to share scores in known social networks.

We’re a
team of two brothers who share a common passion for video games.
Miguel Melo
is an experienced graphics designer and overall asskicker in art. He works on
all of the visual flair and beauty that make our games so nice to look at (pun
intended).Nuno Melo is a Computer Science student and our code ninja. He works on all of
the magic that make our games so fun to play (again, pun intended).
We have big
plans for the future, and hopefully this game will help us kick start a series
of projects already in development.


There’s
only so much we can do with sheer will alone, and although we are already in an
advanced development stage, there are costs associated with the publishing of
the game which we can’t afford, namely the Android license, the Apple Store
license, as well as a Mac OS X computer which is required to develop games for
the iOS platform.
In sum, your funds would go into the following:



Android
Licensing, as well as Android-powered devices for testing.


Apple
Store Licensing, as well as an iOS-powered device for testing.


A
Mac OS X powered computer for development.


Software
Licenses.






ny additional funds will be used to fuel our
human machines, since, as you know, time is money and as a college student and
an unemployed artist, we are very short of both.




Goal #1:
3000 USD -
Build the game for Android and iOS-powered devices (this includes all hardware,
and software/publishing licensing required).
Goal #2:
4000 USD - We
want to deliver the most polished game we can, and for that we need several
testing devices. These additional funds would be put into purchasing a wide
range of testing devices.

</p><h2><strong>PRESENTATION</strong></h2>
<h3>What is this project about?</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Gregor and I'm writing a game about the lives of norse settlers in Iceland, 10th century A.D. The game deals with the trials and issues that the norse people had to deal with on the icelandic frontier. It takes a more accurate historical approach to vikings and their culture than is common in most games, but avoids excessive minutiae of attack rolls or damage, focusing instead on the turbulent relationships and strict cultural norms that make up their original sagas.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><h3>What I'm asking for?</h3>
<p>I need the money so I can print the gamebook the way I envisioned it as well as to cover the expenses I already had in making the game. If I gather more money than I need to accomplish this, the money will go into making the book better and prettier as well as releasing bonus material and ephemera. If the book gets as good as I can make it thanks to your contributions and I still get more money, I will donate some of it to other projects or charity (I haven't yet decided on the specifics).</p>
<h3>What do you get?</h3>
At the most basic level and every level thereafter, you will get a note of thanks in the book. <br/>For 5$ I will send you a black and white pdf of the game.<br/>For 20$ you get the pdf plus a physical copy of the book (please add 10$ for shipping outside the EU).<br/>For 35$ you will get a limited edition pack of the game which will include the pdf as well as the softocoverbook, a rune-stone that I will randomly draw from a bag and laminated playsheets for the game, all inside a jute bag (please add 10$ for shipping outside the EU).<br/>For 50$ you will get a gift/retail bundle of four books (please add 10$ for shipping outside the EU).<p></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Want to know more?</h3>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any other questions, drop me a line in the comments and I will try to answer as many as I can.</p>
<h3>Don't forget to check the <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/254258?c=activity"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Updates"">Updates</a> page for more info.</h3>
<p>--</p>
<h2><strong>FAQ (updated daily; last update: 20th of October)</strong></h2>
<em>Q: I forgot to add 10$ for international shipping. What can I do?</em><p></p>
<p>A: I have added a new pledge level, called ""Shipping outside the EU"". You can make a second pledge at this level if you already backed at the Yggdrasil or Futhark and want your book sent outside the EU but forgot to add $10 to your pledge.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Q: Do I need Apocalypse World to play this game?</em></p>
<p>A: No. Sagas of the Icelanders is a standalone game.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Q: Is Sagas of the Icelanders a reskin of Apocaplypse World?</em></p>
<p>A: Sagas is a ""deep"" hack, meaning that it takes the core systemic framework of Apocalypse World (AW), but creates what is more or less an entirely new game around it, very much like <em>Dungeon World</em>, <em>Monsterhearts</em> or <em>tremulus</em>. If you're already familiar with AW-derived games then you will know how to handle the system but you will perhaps also need to unlearn a few things. If you're new to the AW system, the game provides a lot of ingrained guidance so even first-time roleplayers can jump in without trouble.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Q: Will the game be available outside the crowdfunding campaign?</em></p>
<p>A: I will figure out a way to sell the pdf with a little hassle as possible. I will also print a small number of copies beyond what I need to fulfill all the orders from the backers. I will make those extra copies available in some way, but I can't say anything about the specifics right now.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Question: Will there be more Futhark levels available?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Futhark is limited to the number of runestones I have, which is the number of letters in the futhark alphabet. Sorry. I’ll try to make it so even the Yggdrasil level gets some extra goodies with the book, but that depends on how far the campaign will go.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Question: Can I make a contribution using PayPal?</em><br/>Answer: Not at the moment but I’ll look into adding PayPal support. I'm not based in the US, so handling PayPal is a problem.</p>

(7th of November 2013)

If you've missed the crowdfunding campaign, you can now purchase the game over at the BigCartel webstore.You might also want to check the depository of links and resources (including character sheets) here, and the G+ Sagas Community here.STRETCH GOALS (20th of October)
Now that the game has funded I'm happy to present some stretch goals.
1: At $2,500 I will be able to order art of places and things to give you a better sense of the time and space of the game. - DONE!
2: At $2,800 I will write another character role for the game: the Thrall. Many playtesters were interested in playing a viking slave, so I'll make it possible for you to play one. - DONE!
3: At $3,000 all the backers at Raven and higher will recieve a pdf of the Fiasco playset called Blood Saga by Pedro Ziviani (of BRP: Mythic Iceland). - DONE!

4: At $4,000 
Higher quality paper + a supplemental chapter for playing court cases in the saga period. This chapter will be written by Jason Morningstar (Grey Ranks, Fiasco, Durance...) and based on the historical Grágás legal text. - DONE!
 
5: At $4,500 
An appendix with ""viking"" recipes for the gaming table (by me) + an essay about gender roles and relations during the viking era (by Elin Dalstål, writter on Gaming As Women). - DONE!
 
6: At $5,000
A digital handdrawn map of Iceland + a bonus playbook for playing Grendel-like characters (by Sage LaTorra, co-author of Dungeon World). - DONE!
 
7: At $5,500
Physical map for Futhark or add-on for Yggdrasil + two more essays in the appendix (details forthcoming). - DONE!
 
STILL TO GO:
 
At $7,000:-all the Yggdrasil backers will get the map in physical format-I will get someone to help me edit the book (I can’t catch all the mistakes alone)-I will pass the graphic design and layout of the book over to a professional (I was planning to do it myself and I’m far from a professional)
 
At $8,000
The illustrations in the book will be printed in colour.
 
Racing to the end! 
 


PRESENTATION
What is this project about?
Hi, my name is Gregor and I'm writing a game about the lives of norse settlers in Iceland, 10th century A.D. The game deals with the trials and issues that the norse people had to deal with on the icelandic frontier. It takes a more accurate historical approach to vikings and their culture than is common in most games, but avoids excessive minutiae of attack rolls or damage, focusing instead on the turbulent relationships and strict cultural norms that make up their original sagas.


What I'm asking for?
I need the money so I can print the gamebook the way I envisioned it as well as to cover the expenses I already had in making the game. If I gather more money than I need to accomplish this, the money will go into making the book better and prettier as well as releasing bonus material and ephemera. If the book gets as good as I can make it thanks to your contributions and I still get more money, I will donate some of it to other projects or charity (I haven't yet decided on the specifics).
What do you get?
At the most basic level and every level thereafter, you will get a note of thanks in the book. For 5$ I will send you a black and white pdf of the game.For 20$ you get the pdf plus a physical copy of the book (please add 10$ for shipping outside the EU).For 35$ you will get a limited edition pack of the game which will include the pdf as well as the softocoverbook, a rune-stone that I will randomly draw from a bag and laminated playsheets for the game, all inside a jute bag (please add 10$ for shipping outside the EU).For 50$ you will get a gift/retail bundle of four books (please add 10$ for shipping outside the EU).
 
Want to know more?

If you have any other questions, drop me a line in the comments and I will try to answer as many as I can.
Don't forget to check the Updates page for more info.

FAQ (updated daily; last update: 20th of October)
Q: I forgot to add 10$ for international shipping. What can I do?
A: I have added a new pledge level, called ""Shipping outside the EU"". You can make a second pledge at this level if you already backed at the Yggdrasil or Futhark and want your book sent outside the EU but forgot to add $10 to your pledge.
 
Q: Do I need Apocalypse World to play this game?
A: No. Sagas of the Icelanders is a standalone game.
 
Q: Is Sagas of the Icelanders a reskin of Apocaplypse World?
A: Sagas is a ""deep"" hack, meaning that it takes the core systemic framework of Apocalypse World (AW), but creates what is more or less an entirely new game around it, very much like Dungeon World, Monsterhearts or tremulus. If you're already familiar with AW-derived games then you will know how to handle the system but you will perhaps also need to unlearn a few things. If you're new to the AW system, the game provides a lot of ingrained guidance so even first-time roleplayers can jump in without trouble.
 
Q: Will the game be available outside the crowdfunding campaign?
A: I will figure out a way to sell the pdf with a little hassle as possible. I will also print a small number of copies beyond what I need to fulfill all the orders from the backers. I will make those extra copies available in some way, but I can't say anything about the specifics right now.
 
Question: Will there be more Futhark levels available?
Answer: Futhark is limited to the number of runestones I have, which is the number of letters in the futhark alphabet. Sorry. I’ll try to make it so even the Yggdrasil level gets some extra goodies with the book, but that depends on how far the campaign will go.

Question: Can I make a contribution using PayPal?Answer: Not at the moment but I’ll look into adding PayPal support. I'm not based in the US, so handling PayPal is a problem.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Born in 1985, I have been able to have a broad variety of gaming under my belt.

(note the exclamation mark).  More specifically, we are four friends who have worked together for years; Ben Matheson is the art guy - whether hand-drawn or computer modelled, he's been drawing dragons since he was 6; Chris Gould is our coding wizard - while all of us have programming experience, no-one touches Chris when it comes to bashing out code; Johan Jensen is our resident Norwegian; half-viking, with the beard to prove it.  And then there's myself, Steve Sawyer, the Dungeon Master for most of our gaming sessions and the nominated 'business guy', the one who has to deal with all the boring stuff like budgeting and release dates.  But enough about us - what about the game?</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Game</h3>
<p>Dragons! has been our labour of love for the past 2 years - it came out of a simple question asked during a gaming session; how many games let you actually play as a dragon?  Sure, there are a lot of games that FEATURE dragons, but the ones with dragons as a PC can probably be counted on one claw (the best of which - Choice of Dragons - is text-based and browser only).  As admirers of the noble beasts, we felt someone had to put this to right...and naturally we elected ourselves to do so. </p>
<p>Dragons! was originally designed to be a run-and-gun type game with some treasure collection, but has evolved far beyond that.  It is now an action-strategy-RPG hybrid, which sounds relatively complicated, so let me run you through the basics;</p>
<p>To start the game, you first assign your initial pool of points to each of your four attributes - strength, which determines your hitpoints and physical strength; speed, which governs your speed in both the air and on the ground; intelligence, which determines your mana reserves; and willpower, which determines spell and breath attack strength.  You can also select your elemental type from a choice of fire, ice, storm or earth, which affects your starting breath attack (flame, ice, lightning or boulder respectively), along with the spell types initially available to you.  You can also customise your appearance, choosing your dragon's colour, basic shape, and wing design.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p><a href=""http://s1060.photobucket.com/albums/t446/DragonFlameStudios/?action=view&amp;current=DragonConcept.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Photobucket"" border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1060.photobucket.com/albums/t446/DragonFlameStudios/DragonConcept.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once you have chosen your starting dragon, the world is randomly generated, and you start in your initial lair with a small amount of gold.  Your treasure pile is immensely important - you level up as you collect gold and treasure, gaining further attribute increases and access to more powerful spells, so guard your treasure pile well.  You can gain treasure through raiding towns and villages, destroying trade caravans, defeating monsters, or through completing quests offered by each of the three factions.</p>
<p>The three factions present in the world are the Council of Magi, a neutral body of mages that seeks out knowledge and power, the Altar Dominion, a human empire based around honour, justice and duty, and the Green Horde, a race of orks and goblins who worship war and chaos above all else.  Each of the factions will have a number of towns, villages and cities, with a capital where you can talk to the faction leader and accept quests for further rewards.  Each quest will inevitably bring you into conflict with one or more of the other factions - you can choose to be loyal to one faction, play them off against each other, or simply lay waste to them all.  The more quests you complete for one of the factions, the better the rewards will be - in the case of the Magi, you will recieve additional spells, the Horde will offer additional followers, and the Dominion can provide magical artifacts.  Also, the more you attack one faction, the more hostile they will be, until they actively send heros and champions against you to end your reign of terror.  </p>
<p>There are also a number of unaffiliated villages, towns and cities which you can raid with impunity, but beware - the stronger you become, the stronger their defenses are likely to be.  However, greater strength can also lead to followers willing to devote their lives to you, which leads to the strategy aspect of the game - you can set your followers to work improving your lair to provide additional benefits, and create elaborate traps and safety devices to better protect your treasure pile.  A dragon's hoard is a tempting thing, and occasionally thieves and rogues will try their luck.  If they succeed in getting past your defenses, you'll have to chase them down before they escape with a portion of your gold.</p>
<p>There are lone wizards (not affiliated with the Council of Magi) scattered throughout the world, in their own towers and strongholds.  You can assault these strongholds, and capture the wizards to put to work in your lair to research and unlock additional spells.  Higher-level wizards will be able to research more powerful spells, and will research faster, but beware; the higher-level the wizard, the more dangerous the battle is likely to be.  It's all about balancing the risk-reward ratio.  You can tell the relative level of a wizard from the size and appearance of his stronghold.  The highest-level wizards are the necromancers, who command armies of undead defenders from imposing towers and strongholds - the battle to capture such a wizard will be epic indeed.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>As you grow in strength, you will also have to deal with wannabe heroes trying their luck to become the next St George.  The first few you deal with will be mere trifling annoyances, but they will gradually increase in skill and efficiency as you grow in power.  You can choose to simply fly away and ignore them - they can't fight what they can't reach, after all - but the higher level champions are likely to have magical items, which, as well as counting as a valuable addition to your treasure pile, can also bestow additional benefits, such as increased attributes or even special powers or effects.  You can only have three magical item effects active at one time, so choose them wisely.</p>
<p>The randomly generated levels plus the range of options avaliable at creation should help to keep the game fresh and encourage replayability - there will be a simple campaign included, but more as a tutorial, to get players used to the basic mechanics of the game.  The meat-and-bones is in the randomly generated levels - each game should evolve differently depending on initial choice of dragon, starting position, magical items found, etc.  We plan on adding a lengthier campaign with a full story, with branching pathways based on choices made within the campaign - this should be released a month or two after the full game; all reward tiers above Dragon Yearling will recieve this free of charge.  We also plan on adding multiplayer support as a further expansion, allowing up to four dragons at once to compete in the same world to build their own treasure hoard, in a slightly pared down version of the main game.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Funding</h3>
<p>At this stage, we still have a bit of coding left to finish, and the graphics engine is in need of a bit of spit and polish, which is where you come in; at the moment, we're running behind schedule, and with only four pairs of hands on deck we may not be able to make up the time.  All our funds have been tied up in the development of the game, and now we find ourselves without the additional funds necessary to hire someone else.  With your help and funding, we can afford to take on an additional programmer on a freelance basis to help out with the last of the coding and the graphics update; deity-of-your-choice willing, we can have the beta ready within 2-3 months of the campaign ending, which should theoretically give us enough time to iron out the bugs and sort any balancing issues in time for release by the end of the year.</p>
<p><a href=""http://s1060.photobucket.com/albums/t446/DragonFlameStudios/?action=view&amp;current=FireDragon.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Photobucket"" border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1060.photobucket.com/albums/t446/DragonFlameStudios/FireDragon.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<p>In the horrible event that we don't raise ANY funds, the game will still be released (we're not about to throw in the towel at this stage), but it may get pushed back until sometime next year.  This means, even if we only reach part of our goal, we will still be able to fulfill all our pledge commitments, just perhaps slightly later than we would like. </p>
<p>In the beautiful event that we get over-funding, we'll be able to speed the process even further, and it will allow us to add additional flourishes that we had initially planned but currently don't have time for.  If we do reach our funding goal early, expect some generous stretch-funding goals (with significant additional benefits to those early backers).</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Rewards</h3>
<p>Whilst we know that you are kind, honest, decent people, we also don't expect you to give us your financial support without something in return.  Each backer, from $5 upwards, will be sent a key to the closed beta as soon as it goes live (assuming we meet our funding goal, that should be within 2-3 months of the campaign ending, if not, it may be pushed back a month or two, but we will of course keep you appraised of the situation).</p>
<p>From $10 upwards, you will also recieve a full copy of the game upon release.  This will be a digital download, DRM-free, details will be sent to you as soon as the game is released (if we meet our funding goal, this should be by the end of the year, hopefully in November barring any catastrophies/surprise dragon attacks.  If not, this could be pushed back to early next year, depending on how much funding we raise - again, we will keep you fully abreast of the situation)</p>
<p>From $20 upwards, you will also recieve any additional add-ons or expansions, including the planned campaign, multiplayer support, and any DLC released, no matter how minor.  We plan to keep working on and improving the game for a significant amount of time after release, so expect to see plenty of additional content.</p>
<p>For any of the further perk levels, with the ability to name/create characters or items for the game, we will initially be in touch when the campaign ends to collect some basic details, then will get back in touch within a month or two to create the content with you.  After the campaign ends, our first priority will be to get the beta up and running, but rest assured that you will receive your full reward for the game going live.  If you have any personalised content, such as the personal magic item or dragon, it will be provided as a personal DLC along with the release of the full game - if you wish, it will remain personal to you, and not be released to any other owner of the game.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Of course, any donation at any level is appreciated - all backers will earn a special place within our hearts, for having the faith in us and in Dragons! to show your support.  Thank you</p></div>","UPDATE #2 As the campaign is taking it's time to get off the ground, we have decided to add in some additional rewards for the first people to back us.  The first 10 backers will receive some unique dragon artwork, created and signed by our resident dragon artist Ben.  These rewards will be included on top of the usual perk reward, and will be regardless of actual amount pledged.


UPDATE #1 To clarify, we’ve chosen a 25 day time limit for the campaign. This may seem short in comparison to other indiegogo campaigns; while we would love to have a longer 40 or 50 day campaign to encourage word-of-mouth spread, time is of the essence – the sooner we can arrange the funding, the sooner we can bring on additional help to get the game into beta

Across the world, hundreds of thousands of people get together and enjoy LARPs that range from high fantasy to personal drama, big budget live combat games to intimate freeform Nordic dramas. From battleships dressed up to be Battlestars to educational games that inspire children and adults to learn, LARP is a genre of games like no other. That's why scholarship and exploration of LARP is so important to keep the field growing. </p><p>That is the purpose of the <b>Living Games Conference.</b></p><p>My name is <b>Shoshana Kessock</b>. I'm a graduate student at the <b>NYU Game Center</b> in Brooklyn, New York. As a game designer and scholar who specializes in LARP, I chose to create the Living Games Conference as my graduate thesis so as to create a place where scholars, designers and community leaders could come together and share their expertise and passion for LARP. My aim was to create a three day conference that would feature <b>panels</b>, <b>workshops</b> and even a <b>games showcase </b>for the attendees to enjoy. Now, with the support of the NYU Game Center, that dream is becoming a reality. </p><p>But to get the conference on its feet, I'm reaching out to you for help.</p><p>While fundraising has covered much of the cost of the conference, additional funds are needed, especially for one of the biggest parts of the conference: <b>documentation</b>. An important part of LARP scholarship is documenting events for posterity to be studied later. I want to make the events that go on at the conference can be made available not only to those who can't attend, but to those who might want to study the talks for future reference and inspiration. For that, some money must be raised. </p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>To properly fund the conference and provide the equipment for documenting the content properly, we are seeking $1000. This will contribute to:</p><ul>
<li>Getting equipment for documentation (audio/visual equipment and assistance)</li>
<li>Graphic design and printing costs for conference materials.</li>
</ul><div>Should our initial goals be met, the additional funds will be added to sundry needs for the conference, including aiding conference attendees who seek financial assistance to attend the event.</div><div>For your contributions, depending on the tier you donate, you get access to certain perks:</div><div>
<ul>
<li>At $10 you receive a thank you email from the conferences director, and your name is listed on the website as a conference supporter.</li>
<li>At $30 you receive a signed Living Games Conference poster! This limited run of posters will only be created for this conference, and contributors will have theirs signed by designer Cryssy Cheung. </li>
<li>At $100 you receive the conference proceedings sent to you on a USB drive straight to you address. No need to watch the videos online when you can have them all for your own. You will also receive a copy of the poster.</li>
<li>At $300 you will receive a short freeform LARP written for you by conference director and veteran LARP writer Shoshana Kessock. You will discuss with Shoshana what elements you want in the LARP and will receive a short game in return for you and your friends to play. (To be received summer 2014 - writing LARPs takes some time!)</li>
</ul>
<div>No matter the tier, you will receive updates from the conference team about the conference, as well as links to the conference documentation once it goes online. You'll be contributing to our success, and we will share the fruits of that success with you as soon as they go online. </div>
</div><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>This conference is the very first live action role-play conference of its kind in the United States. By supporting Living Games, you'll be supporting not only the expansion of LARP and game scholarship, but you'll be helping to build a space where people can come together to share their ideas and design tools to build better games. Not only that, but with your support we'll then be able to take what happens at the conference and share it with the rest of the world through our documentation. </p><p>Should the conference go well this year, we're hoping to make Living Games an ongoing project in the years to come. But to do that, this year's event has to happen first! I'm passionate about seeing this space built for games and with your help, I believe we can make it happen. </p><p></p><p></p><h3>Can't Contribute? There Are Other Ways To Support The Conference!</h3><p></p><p>If you find that you can't contribute, help us get the word out to the community at large! Share this fundraiser or spread the word about the conference itself to those that might want to attend. Every little bit helps to bring this conference to life.</p><p>I appreciate your support and thank you for helping make this event a success!</p></div>","Help Support the Living Games Conference!Live Action Role-Play is a vibrant and exciting corner of the game world.

As a game designer and scholar who specializes in LARP, I chose to create the Living Games Conference as my graduate thesis so as to create a place where scholars, designers and community leaders could come together and share their expertise and passion for LARP. My aim was to create a three day conference that would feature panels, workshops and even a games showcase for the attendees to enjoy. Now, with the support of the NYU Game Center, that dream is becoming a reality. But to get the conference on its feet, I'm reaching out to you for help.While fundraising has covered much of the cost of the conference, additional funds are needed, especially for one of the biggest parts of the conference: documentation. An important part of LARP scholarship is documenting events for posterity to be studied later. I want to make the events that go on at the conference can be made available not only to those who can't attend, but to those who might want to study the talks for future reference and inspiration. For that, some money must be raised. What We Need & What You GetTo properly fund the conference and provide the equipment for documenting the content properly, we are seeking $1000. This will contribute to:
Getting equipment for documentation (audio/visual equipment and assistance)
Graphic design and printing costs for conference materials.
Should our initial goals be met, the additional funds will be added to sundry needs for the conference, including aiding conference attendees who seek financial assistance to attend the event.For your contributions, depending on the tier you donate, you get access to certain perks:

At $10 you receive a thank you email from the conferences director, and your name is listed on the website as a conference supporter.
At $30 you receive a signed Living Games Conference poster! This limited run of posters will only be created for this conference, and contributors will have theirs signed by designer Cryssy Cheung. 
At $100 you receive the conference proceedings sent to you on a USB drive straight to you address. No need to watch the videos online when you can have them all for your own. You will also receive a copy of the poster.
At $300 you will receive a short freeform LARP written for you by conference director and veteran LARP writer Shoshana Kessock. You will discuss with Shoshana what elements you want in the LARP and will receive a short game in return for you and your friends to play. (To be received summer 2014 - writing LARPs takes some time!)

No matter the tier, you will receive updates from the conference team about the conference, as well as links to the conference documentation once it goes online. You'll be contributing to our success, and we will share the fruits of that success with you as soon as they go online. 
The ImpactThis conference is the very first live action role-play conference of its kind in the United States. By supporting Living Games, you'll be supporting not only the expansion of LARP and game scholarship, but you'll be helping to build a space where people can come together to share their ideas and design tools to build better games. Not only that, but with your support we'll then be able to take what happens at the conference and share it with the rest of the world through our documentation. Should the conference go well this year, we're hoping to make Living Games an ongoing project in the years to come. But to do that, this year's event has to happen first! I'm passionate about seeing this space built for games and with your help, I believe we can make it happen. Can't Contribute? There Are Other Ways To Support The Conference!If you find that you can't contribute, help us get the word out to the community at large! Share this fundraiser or spread the word about the conference itself to those that might want to attend. Every little bit helps to bring this conference to life.I appreciate your support and thank you for helping make this event a success!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>Hello! My name is Rocco, and I am a game programmer and entrepreneur. About five years ago, I became strongly interested in computers and programming, so I looked around and became absorbed into the world of technology.</p>
<p>Last year, I started to put my skills to use and formed a company, Terrified Virus Games. I created a business plan, registered it under ""Sole Proprietorship"", and then began to make games. These started off as simple HTML5 games, which are games that can run in your browser, and can scale themselves if ran from a mobile device. I would then license these games to publishers for a fee.</p>
<p>However, this didn't make enough money to cover some of the major costs, and due to my computer getting messed up, many of the files became corrupt, meaning I couldn't send them to the publishers. So what I need from you guys is the funding required to pay for a new computer, as well as the money needed to pay for employees, and get better software (Photoshop CS2 is an entire four generations behind, and therefore unsatisfactory...).</p>

<h3>Where does the money go?</h3>
<p>A new computer can cost a lot of money. To get a <strong>reliable</strong> MacBook Air, the minimum payment is $1600. I also need to pay for the graphics/audio. Graphics alone for a small, mobile game, on average, costs $300. Another thing I want to start doing is create native mobile apps, not ""web apps"" that run in the browser. To do this, I would need an iPod Touch to test it on, as well as an Apple Developer License, which is $100, and upgraded software. Below is a list of just some of the major things that need to be funded:</p>
<ul>
<li>MacBook Air - $1600</li>
<li>Various Software Costs - $1000</li>
<li>Licenses - $200</li>
<li>Game Assets Per Major Mobile Game - $1000</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, it costs a lot to make games. Too much. Especially for someone my age, as I don't have a backup job to pay for it all. However, if you do decide to donate to me, you will receive various benefits. For just $25, you get one week of advertising on one website, whichever has the highest traffic (I have two main websites). For $75, you will receive one month of advertising on one website. $150 will get you one month of advertising, as well as a T-Shirt with the Terrified Virus Games logo on it. However, these are limited. For $500 and above, you get the master package. This includes everything found below (one month free advertising, and a T-Shirt), but with one other very special perk. You get to be the designer of one of my games, and in the credits, you will be the project lead. This perk is priceless.</p>

I worked on many IT projects, including games, mobile apps, web apps, facebook apps, and so, Many of them were designed for great top companies. But I decided to quit my job and focus completely on WolfWars. This simple. The story and concept of WolfWars was created by me and my 2 sons which are at different ages. So I am quite proud of them, and very proud of game itself.After few tries of showing this game to digital audience, I noticed that game is very easy to understand & playable for literally anyone. So I've put all of my money in the development, I brought some of the best people in industry, and now, after 4 months of development we have really playable version of our game. It is great.So why this campaign?Our resources are big enough to create game as it is now. And it will be great. But, to fulfil the vision of bringing game worldwide in triple A quality, we need your help and support. All funds raised by indiegogo campaign will go directly into the game development. Said in words:
3D environments: each of our heroes is from different side of the world. Each of them is in the power of different element. (air, earth, fire, water)cards: WolfWars is not pure TCG/CCG but our story, and its extensions, demand more cardssounds&musicprogramming (singleplayer/multiplayer)testingWhat will happen if campaign fails?We put too much effort to not finish this game if this campaign fails. But we won't be able to finish this game as original & mind-blowing as we would be if we reach our goal.How can you help?You already helped by watching our video and reading this article. You can help us even more by spreading a word about this game or even more by funding this project.Thank you very much for you time, help and support.Peter HrdyFeel free to contact me:peter.hrdy@gmail.com+421944320875http://www.wolfwarsgame.comGame Overview - Heroes & CardsWolfWars game is not about trading or collecting cards. Each player has the same amount of cards from the beginning to the end. There is no f2p/pay2win model, you all have same chances at the start.Before you start the game, you will need to create your deck. Deck needs to have 1 hero and 5 playing cards. You can have as many decks as you wish to have. These 5 cards are all what you have during one game. You do not sacrifice any of them. All cards are on your hand without “spending” them and throwing any of them out of deck to graveyard.For now, there are 4 races of cards. Each race has 4 cards with element variation.For example:Warriors – 1x air warrior, 1x earth warrior, 1x fire warrior, 1x water warriorDragons – 1x air dragon, 1x earth dragon, 1x fire dragon, 1x water dragonGot it? Other 2 races are Wolves and Witches.Each race has their specific behaviour, but all of them have general preferences like Attack Power, Defence, Cooldown, Stamina cost. But not all of them have it from start.
Dragons - strongest cards in attack with no defence. Expensive for stamina and each of cards need to take a nap after turn (cooldown).Wolves – semi strong cards in attack with no defence. No cooldown.Warriors – same value for attack and defence, a bit weaker than Wolves in attack, but much cheaper for stamina with no cooldown.Witches – strong in defence with minimum attack, very cheap for stamina use and with cooldown needs.So these are races and cards we do currently have in our pre-alpha version.Heroes:There are 4 heroes. Wolves. Each of them has different nature, something like classes in Call of Duty or BattlefieldErghar - airwolf – recon: It is hard to hit him, and it is not possible to hit him with 100% attackTherius – earthwolf – support: His stamina is never drained because is automatic refilledRothal – firewolf – assault: He is king of the hill – for me:).

</div></div>","In the distant future, there are rumors of a mysterious cyborg running 
an abandoned hidden research facility on a planet far from the center of
 human civilizations.His mysterious origin attracts the Star System 
Governments to investigate the truth of this cyborg called The Admin and
 reclaim the facility with all its researches inside. But little is 
known to the Governments, because we, humans, are not the only beings 
interested in this mysterious cyborg.
 Play as The Admin, a cyborg 
wielding gun and sword in defending the research facility from humans 
who try to reclaim it and from other beings try to destroy him. Forge 
sharper swords to slice all who endangers the mission, craft deadlier 
guns to put a hole in the body of invaders, and evolve to be better at 
surviving....



GAMEPLAY
OF THE ADMIN



This game  is a single player 3rd
person action adventure game where you play as a cyborg called The Admin.  As the only thing that left in a hidden research facility,
he must keep the facility running and defend it from anything that is
threatening his mission. You will have 2 weapons, a handgun and a sword, and
some skills that can be used in your battle against the enemy. As your journey
goes on, these weapons and skills can improved and evolved to help you defeat
stronger enemies. Screenshots of the game in action













UNIQUE ENEMIES

There
are three types of enemies in The Admin which are :  The Wildlife
Creatures, The Solar System Government's Spec Ops and The Xenotroops. Each of
them has 5 types of variations with unique appearance and distinct strategy to
defeat them. Let's introduce some of them..
 The Wildlife Creatures

From left to right: Basraptor, Cave Maggot and Spinger


       These
are dangerous wildlife creatures that inhabit the planet where the hidden
research facility is located. The size of these creatures varies from the small
annoying maggot to the giant apex predator. And each of them will have
different way to take down its prey. Like the spinger spitting acid or the
basraptor charging its prey.


SSG SpecOps








From left to right : Assault, Veteran and MBoIS Suit equipped Soldier


       In this
era, human civilization has spread to dozens of solar system under the Star
Systems Governments. Yet after visiting more than one hundred planets, humanity
had never met another intelligence life forms. To keep these  dozens of solar systems safe, the SSG had a
very reliable armies. And the one that is feared  the most by pirates and separatists is the
SSG Spec Ops, which members are all highly trained soldiers. Even there are
genetically enhanced super soldiers among them.
The Xenotroops




From left to right :  Ripper, Xenogunner and Heavy Xenogunner


    On the
other side of milky way far from the reach of human civilizations, there are another
civilizations way bigger and more advanced than the humanity. Most of these
alien civilizations united as one big alliance and have spread to countless of
solar system. One of them is the Xenotroops, a race of space roaming warriors equipped
with very advanced weaponry ready to annihilate everything that is threatening
the alliance.

MULTIPLE WAYS TO DEVELOP THE CHARACTER


     Because of the ever growing threat that is ready to destroy The Admin and
all his works, you  will need better
weapons and skills to survive. The gun and sword can be upgraded to become deadlier physical or energy weapons type. This energy or physical type will have
more advantage against certain type of enemy.

    Just

<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong><br/>I had always dreamed of being part of a racing league, but never had a game I felt good enough at to join a league. A lot of racing games required a racing wheel or an advanced understanding of car mechanics to be competitive. Most of all though, I didn't know anyone in these leagues which didn't fill me with confidence. </p>
<p><br/>Late last year, my beautiful fiance and partner for 9 years was diagnosed with cancer. This came as a huge shock to us and our families. It had an immediate effect on our lives, reducing our hours at work and social interaction. For the past 6 months I have been doing 2 days a week mostly with the rest of my time with Louise either at home, or during her chemotherapy treatment at the <a href=""https://www.petermac.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Peter MacCallum Cancer Center</a>.</p>
<p><br/>With mental and financial strain pulling at me every day, my business began to fail. I had started a small business building arcade machines and consoles with my friend Daniel the year before which was slowly building momentum. However, upon the release of our console, the decision was made to end the business. At times it felt like everything was falling apart. With the added hours at home and at the Peter Mac, I turned to video games as an escape. I found that escape in Gran Turismo Sport.<br/>The first 3 Gran Turismo's had me hooked. I still play Gran Turismo 2 to this day. The new installment had everything I was looking for in a game. Amazing graphics, incredible online game play, but most of all, the opportunity to create and upload your own artwork to the livery editor and design your own cars. With a passion for the V8 Supercars series and a company name I was itching to re-brand, the Thrillhouse Arcade Racing Team was born.</p>
<p><br/>I began by recreating famous liveries from the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/supercars/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Supercars</a> series and posting them on various Gran Turismo Facebook pages , I managed to create a bit of a following within the game. I made the mistake of mentioning Louise's illness in a post, and I received a some hateful comments from a few younger guys. How I handled the situation caught the eye of the admin team of the major <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/GranTurismoSportCommunity/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Gran Turismo Sport</a> page, and I was invited to be an administrator.<br/><br/>Using my viewpoint of the community, I reached out to a few Australian and Kiwi members to start a racing team. My first admin, Lucas Szoka, and I had an instant connection. Lucas' life is touched by the dreaded C too. It wasn't long after that I realised I was creating a safe space for people who share my interests, but most importantly a place where we could get away from the stresses of our day to day lives. Strangers on the internet saved me from spiraling out of control when my partner needed me the most. Other members joined because they loved the close, hard and fair racing we represent.<br/><br/>I have grown to truly love the community we created together and I'm looking forward to watching it grow.<br/><br/><strong>THE THRILLHOUSE ARCADE VISION</strong></p>
<p><br/>To my amazement the Thrillhouse Arcade Racing Team is already something I am truly proud of. With 60 amazing members contributing content everyday, events held 3-4 times a week and various competitions regarding liveries, we have already become very well known in the Gran Turismo community!<br/><br/>In February we launched our first Twitch Live stream with commentary from one of our members. We had 40 viewers on our first stream with a lot of positive feedback around the liveries we created for our vehicles, the quality of the racing and how well presented Thrillhouse is.<br/><br/>It is my goal to grow Thrillhouse into a 24/7 e-channel hosting races from all over the world on our channel via our various allies, global competitions and even the possibility to branch out into a physical appearance at gaming conventions with racing rigs.

</div><h3>Soyez libre de reprendre la bonne parole sur les réseaux sociaux ""Don't start a war without your Battle flaG !""</h3></div>","BattleflaG 33 C.Ruins 1 used during a Show ( Mons August the 21st 2015 ).During my first shows, as a game designer, I soon faced the problem caused by a hard playing surface . By meeting some clever persons, I started to study an alternative to game boards. I began to create my own designs, dedicated to my own game, and printed them on synthetic cloth. End of 2014, I extended this to other games in other formats. The interest of the public was here, but now I need you to extend my range.
Lors de mes premières sorties en convention de jeux, en tant que créateur de jeu,  j'ai vite été confronté au problème engendré par une surface de jeu en dur. En faisant de bonnes rencontres, je me suis mis à étudier une alternative aux plateaux de jeu en créant mes designs dédiés a mon jeu sur du tissus synthetique. Fin 2014 j'ai étendu cette technique pour d'autres jeux, en d'autres formats. L'intérêt du public est sans nul conteste au rendez vous, mais j'ai besoin de vous pour étendre ma gamme et prendre une vitesse de croisière.








The battlemats are made from lightweight synthetic cloth. They are easy to transport, washable and can be ironed with steam.Dimensions may vary slightly due to the manufacture process, but they will never be shorter than expected.





Les tapis sont imprimés sur du tissus synthétique. Ils sont légers et faciles à transporter. Ils peuvent être lavés et repassés à la vapeur. Ils vous suivront partout sans encombres.
Les dimensions annoncées peuvent varier légèrement en raison du processus de fabrication. Cependant celles ci ne seront jamais plus petite que la côte annoncée.





To help me expand my range you can choose to get for 1 battlemat or more. 
If you choose for 1 battlemat, select the right perk and add the shipping. I'll send you a e-mail to know the mat you wish. 
You want more battlemats ( mixing or not with Premium) ? 
Depending on the number you wish ( add every mats of every sizes)  a discount will apply. The table below gives you prices for each mat. Then you just have to select the good perk ( More than X ), add the prices and shipping . I'll send you an e-mail to know your wishes. 
For example you wish a BattleflaG 22 and the 2 BattleflaGs 33, living in Europe. So you get for 1 x 17€ + 2x 19€ + 10€ = 65€. Choose the perk ""more than 1"" and add in custom ""gift"" 64€ ( 65€-1€).







Afin de m'aider à agrandir et lancer la gamme BattleflaG vous pouvez choisir d'acquérir 1 ou plusieurs tapis.
Si vous choisissez 1 tapis, sélectionnez la contrepartie dédiée et ajoutez les frais de ports ( voir note si dessus ). J'enverrai un e-mail pour connaître le modèle désiré.
Vous voulez plus de tapis ( mélangeant ou non les standards et les premium)?
Selon le nombre total de tapis désiré, un tarif dégressif s'applique ( voir le tableau ci dessus intitulé Discounted prices ). Selectionnez le bonne contrepartie , ""more than 1"" si vous souhaitez de 2 a 4 tapis, ""more than 4"" si vous prenez de 5 a 9 tapis ou ""more than 9"" pour un nombre plus grand. Il ne vous reste plus qu'à additionner les prix et les frais de port .J'enverrai un mail pour connaitre vos choix. 
Par exemple vous souhaitez recevoir 1 BattleflaG 22 et 2 BattleflaGs 33, habitant en France. Vous obtenez 1 x 17€ + 2x 19€ + 7€ = 62€ . Choisissez la contrepartie ""more than 1"" et ajoutez 61€ en ""cadeau spplémentaire"" (62€-1€).



The range is organised by size. Grids and hex series are available too. And it's called BattleflaG. All of those designs are available both for BattleflaG and BattleflaG Premium ( see below ).

<div> </div>
<div>Die Flüge sind bereits gebucht, damit sie günstig bleiben, daher ist das Budget auch schon mit 700.- ungefähr abschätzbar. Sollten wir dieses Ziel geringfügig überschreiten, würde ich die Siegerehrung nach unserem Kart-Rennen mit echtem Champagner ausstatten.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Andernfalls: Prosecco ! :-)</div>

<p>Wer sich also noch nicht in unüberschaubare Unkosten für ein Geburtstagsgeschenk gestürzt hat, welches ich mir für den Rest meines Lebens auf den Kaminsims stellen werde, kann sich gerne an dieser Kampagne beteiligen und mir die Freude meiner Freunde machen!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Als Gegenleistung gibt es von mir für jeden und ungeachtet Rang und Stand:</p>
<p>Ein Ticket für eine Tour in meinem neuen Entschleunigungsrenner:</p>
<p>FIAT 500 A (""Topolino"")</p>
<p>Einige werden diese Tour sicher schon am 13.07.2013 geboten bekommen. Mit anderen werden wir das dann nachholen!</p>

<h2>WHAT IS CLAM MAN</h2>
<p>Clam Man is the story of the eponymous Clam Man, a lowly office worker content with his easy life. However, when he suddenly gets laid off from Snacky Bay Prime Mayonnaise, he is cast into a web of intrigue, lies, deception, and ducks. Join him on his adventure to discover the real reason behind being let go.</p>
<ul>
<li>Explore the seedy underbelly of the bustling underwater metropolis Snacky Bay!</li>
<li>Interact with more than 20 unique characters, each stranger than the last!</li>
<li>Choose how to steer conversations with a medium-sized novel's worth of dialogue!</li>
<li>Examine a lot of plants!</li>
<li>You want sandbags? We got sandbags!</li>
<li>Ponder the merits of recreational concrete!</li>
<li>And just <i>how </i>do those big machines at construction sites that go wroom wroom work?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Clam Man </strong>is aspiring to be a comedy game: a game where the experience above all else is designed to make you laugh. While there are a few puzzles in the short- to medium-length game, the primary focus has always been the dialogue, the characters, and the simple, dry artstyle. It's a game you can relax with, slowly make your way through, taking things in at your own pace. Depending on the player, we're looking at a 5-6 hour game.</p>
<p><br/><br/>BUT WHO IS TEAM CLAM</p>
<p>We’re a team of three, making our first game together. Now don’t let that worry you about whether or not we can finish the game: most of it is already done! We’ve been hard at work on this for a long time, and we decided to share it with the world only when we were getting close to the end of development.</p>

<p><i><strong>Martin: </strong></i>Wrote and designed pretty much the whole game. Besides that, he drew the character sprites and animated them. He likes long walks on the couch and lazy Mondays playing video games at the beach.</p>

<p><i><strong>Jakob:</strong></i> Like, a million lines of code. There’s a lot of code in this game, guys, not sure if you know. Jakob’s also our video editing guy, and his favorite food is spaghetti and a-spicy memeballs. (Obi Wan Jakoby wanted to add ""Literally no one calls me that or has ever called me that"")</p>

<p><i><strong>Madeline: </strong></i>With her superior color vision, Maddie does all the background art and coloring of the game.

<p>Clam Man is coming out, whether you like it or not. However, with your help, we can make Clam Man stronger than you could have possibly imagined. That's a Star Wars reference, in case you missed it. The writing in the game is that subtle too.</p>

</div></div>","Oh, hello. 

Welcome to our Indiegogo campaign! Nice to see you here. We just wanted to remind you that you can play our
DEMO
online already! Try it out here, and see if it's something for you!


 
WHAT IS CLAM MAN
Clam Man is the story of the eponymous Clam Man, a lowly office worker content with his easy life. However, when he suddenly gets laid off from Snacky Bay Prime Mayonnaise, he is cast into a web of intrigue, lies, deception, and ducks. Join him on his adventure to discover the real reason behind being let go.

Explore the seedy underbelly of the bustling underwater metropolis Snacky Bay!
Interact with more than 20 unique characters, each stranger than the last!
Choose how to steer conversations with a medium-sized novel's worth of dialogue!
Examine a lot of plants!
You want sandbags? We got sandbags!
Ponder the merits of recreational concrete!
And just how do those big machines at construction sites that go wroom wroom work?



 

Clam Man is aspiring to be a comedy game: a game where the experience above all else is designed to make you laugh. While there are a few puzzles in the short- to medium-length game, the primary focus has always been the dialogue, the characters, and the simple, dry artstyle. It's a game you can relax with, slowly make your way through, taking things in at your own pace. Depending on the player, we're looking at a 5-6 hour game.
BUT WHO IS TEAM CLAM
We’re a team of three, making our first game together. Now don’t let that worry you about whether or not we can finish the game: most of it is already done! We’ve been hard at work on this for a long time, and we decided to share it with the world only when we were getting close to the end of development.

Martin: Wrote and designed pretty much the whole game. Besides that, he drew the character sprites and animated them. He likes long walks on the couch and lazy Mondays playing video games at the beach.

Jakob: Like, a million lines of code. There’s a lot of code in this game, guys, not sure if you know. Jakob’s also our video editing guy, and his favorite food is spaghetti and a-spicy memeballs. (Obi Wan Jakoby wanted to add ""Literally no one calls me that or has ever called me that"")

Madeline: With her superior color vision, Maddie does all the background art and coloring of the game. She’s also been responsible for a lot of the promotional art we’ve posted. She loves anime WAY TOO MUCH and frankly, it's weird.Anyway: We've wanted to make games for our entire lives. It's a life long dream. And here we are! We made one! Well, almost. But we're getting there, and we'd love to have you along for the ride! That sounds super cheesy! Oh boy!


WHERE DOES MY CASH MONEY GO
Even though most of the game is done, there’s a lot of stuff to do. Some of this stuff we can do on our own: fixing bugs, polishing the dialogue and upgrading certain art assets, but then there’s things we can’t do without your help!
LIKE AUDIO?
The game was developed with a staggering budget of ZERO money, and so far, that’s fine. Clam Man, as it is right now, is entirely made by Team Clam. But there are some things we can’t do on our own. One of these things is
The soundtrack, which so far has been only royalty-free tracks and possibly one or two written by the team. Now, depending on the success of the campaign, we can either spend a week or two picking out pre-made tracks from a reputable music licenser, or if we do really well, hire a composer to either some or all of the tracks!
(Oh, and if we get enough support to hire a composer, a lot of the Perks will have the original soundtrack added to them as a bonus!)
Besides the music, we really want to bring the town of Snacky Bay to life with more than the visuals and the soundtrack, which means

Foley and sound effects! This is a less costly endeavor, but still requires time and money!
Some of the money also goes to taxes, and getting the game on steam.
Some of the money goes to software licenses.
And then finally, a chunk of the money goes to us, the devs. After all, we need to eat and pay rent while we’re polishing up the game, right? You think we're some kinda robots that just need electricity? Well buster, electricity isn't free either. Yeah, ever think of that?

 

 

BUT HOW CAN I AND MY STACKS OF CASH MONEY HELP
Clam Man is coming out, whether you like it or not. However, with your help, we can make Clam Man stronger than you could have possibly imagined. That's a Star Wars reference, in case you missed it. The writing in the game is that subtle too.
What does that mean? No, not the Star Wars thing, the other thing. Well, working on the game in your spare time can only get you so far. To make Clam Man the game that we believe it can be, we need more time and money. Mostly money. Because money can buy time. Money trumps Father Time. Take that, old man.
Anyway, enough joking around. I'll be serious for a second. With your support, you can give us the resources to not only finish Clam Man, but also give it a rocking soundtrack, hours and hours of playtesting, and the polish that we believe it deserves. The more support we get, the more resources we have to pour into the game. We want this game to be good. We love this game, and we believe in this game. And as such, we really hope you'll believe in it too.
 

 

YOU'RE NOT JUST GONNA STEAL MY MONEY ARE YOU
Wow, that's almost a rude question. It's okay, I'm gonna let it slide.
Like I said earlier, the game is nearing completion. It's going to come out, no matter what. That's why we have the flexible goal: Any amount you guys get together, is going to go into the game. There's no fixed budget to make this game happen, it was always going to happen. It's just a question of how soon and how good, and with every backer, the game is going to get better. And together, we can make Clam Man really good. We know that.

 
WHAT ARE THESE PERKS 
We tried to include as much possible amounts
as possible, so you can find whichever one you feel is right for you! We appreciate all support, and are incredibly grateful for any amount you're willing to back.
That said, if there are no perks that interest you, let us know! If you want to back us with a very certain amount of money, or would like something particular in return, please email us and we'll see what we can do!  (teamclamman@gmail.com)

<p>The Other Brothers is an episodic platformer that will have you running, jumping, collecting and racing against the clock in a modern take on that time-tested genre! </p>

<p><strong>Why Indiegogo?</strong></p>
<p>Game development is an exciting, fun and enjoyable process, but it's also an expensive one. Being indie developers means that whilst we have the freedom to make unique games without a publisher breathing down our necks, it also means that we're doing this out of our own pockets. <br/><br/>Despite the team being made up of talented, industry professionals with many years of experience, this doesn't mean we have all bases covered:</p>
<p><strong>The Indiegogo money will allow us to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bring in professional translators</li>
<li>Have a full, original soundtrack and sound effects written and recorded</li>
<li>Purchase hardware for testing <em>(we want to support a wide range of devices, not everyone can afford a top end iPad!)</em>
</li>
<li>Purchase additional licenses <em>(we love you Linux users, why should you be left out?) </em><strong>If we gain at least 50 $100 backers  Linux and Ouya* will be prioritized.<br/></strong>
</li>
<li>Allow us to continue developing this title full-time until completion <em>(work began in January and actual game development started in April!).</em>
</li>
</ul><p>           <em>*Ouya release will obviously be dependant on when the console launches.</em></p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why do we need $50,000?</strong><br/><br/>This game has been in development since January - $50,000 may sound like a lot but it is exactly how much it costs to develop a video game like this. <br/>Four Unity Licenses with support for 2 devices, android and iOS already come to $20,000, then we have to purchase all of the items mentioned above (and more!) which leaves us with very little for the team to actually survive on! If you divide the remainder into the four members of the team and we come out with less than half a minimum-wage, fast food worker's salary!<br/><br/>We want to bring you an awesome music score, real, professional translations and proper hardware testing, these funds aren't for our pleasure- they're to make sure this game is as great as it can possibly be!</p>

Thomas' day-to-day duties not only include project, gameplay and level design, he is also responsible for managing the technical duties for the entire art team! He makes sure that all art meets the original vision and is game-ready. 
Thomas actually creates the level layouts and gameplay mechanics, and builds the scenarios you will play using all of the tools at his disposal to make interesting player experiences. He takes the artwork and makes it 'game-ready'. Thomas generally leads the public face for the project through Facebook and Twitter.
Thomas owns 3D Attack, is a professional 3D Artist and has produced work for Warner Brothers, Disney, Nike, Intel and more.
Björn Hurri - Designer, Art Director & Lead Artist
Björn created the visual style of the game and also animates a majority of the sprites. Together with Thomas his design work focus' on the visual elements of the game. He is responsible for bringing the wonderful world in which our unlikely heroes live in to life!Outside of the project, Björn works as Lead Artist for one of the gaming industries leading Concept Art and Production studios.  He has done work for many AAA-titles and/or IP's including, Dead Space 2, Bioshock Infinite, Sniper Ghost Warrior 2, Spec Ops: Front Line, Infamous 2, Shadowrun, Total War and many more!
Robert Cummings - Mad Scientist & DeveloperRobert is a Director of Simian Squared Ltd, a British developer specializing in unique and visually rich playable games on console, desktop and mobile hardware. He is responsible for building the technology and game play behind The Other Brothers. Known as The Ape, or just Ape, he can be found wandering around England, programming retro awesome for you.
Robert is the Programmer, he builds the code for the entire title from the player's movement 'feel', the tools we use to make gameplay events, the AI, to the render engine and all that is inbetween.
Aside from the underlying technical stuff, he also provides art in the form of code for things like physics toys (conveyors, fans, water), weather effects, camera tools and visual effects (pixel transitions, weather systems, screen burn, overbrightening and more!)(you can read a little about the project's technology at his dev blog: http://simiansquared.com/category/diary/)
Giuseppe Landolina - ArtistGiuseppe is Creative Director at Simian Squared Ltd. He is responsible for the cinematics on The Other Brothers as well as art and design support. Known as the Chimp, he can be found foraging through England's forests in search of fresh inspiration to fuel his passion; retro & vintage aesthetics and presentation.
Giuseppe's day to day roles include animating the cutscenes, managing the dialog, making custom art for the cutscenes, building the menus and generally supporting Bjorn in the art department. Aside from this he supports Robert with the features and tools and effects for Thomas to use in the levels!
 

 


The Other Brothers is being developed using UNITY and SIMIAN TECH
Unity is a fully integrated development engine that provides rich out of the box functionality to create games and other interactive 3D content.  You use Unity to assemble your art and assets into scenes and environments; add physics; simultaneously play test and edit your game, and when ready, publish to your chosen platforms, such as desktop computers, the Web, iOS, Android, Wii, PS3 and Xbox 360.
The Other Brothers is built upon Simian Squared's proprietary toolset, Simian Tech. It was developed to empower artists, to allow them to focus on what they do best, making games.
The art team on The Other Brothers makes use of Simian Tech's Mode 7, a highly optimized set of rendering and shader technologies in combination with their set of level design tools that allow developers to craft great physics, playability, dynamic events and complex mechanics in an intuitive way.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>About myself and the game</h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Julien Dupuis and I'm a student at Isart Digital Montreal in game design. I've been working my solo indie game Deuce for the past few years now and I'm eager to continue developing games that will revolutionize the industry.</p>
<h3><u><i><strong>DEMO is being updated</strong></i></u></h3>
<p>Deuce is a special type of RPG where you - the player - go through a profound narrative experience where the two main characters lose parts of their humanity along the way while discovering the characters' unique playstyles while also forming bonds with the witty and charming characters' duality, you will soon find that the protagonists have a strong dynamic. Explore the intricacies of humanity in this light-hearted approach at philosophy through gaming.​</p>
<p>This RPG/RogueLite will focus heavily on replayability where the player will have multiple ways of playing the game to their liking. ​</p>
<p>The first option, the classical mode where the player chooses to attack the incoming enemies will be lead by Adria. The second, a powerful geomancer named Zaakir decides his powers can best be used to evade confrontation and thus will play as a pacifist. Each gameplay style can be swapped at the press of a button and different styles will earn you morality points which will influence your gameplay experience.</p>
<h3>Financial Objective</h3>
<p>As a contributor, your donations can go a very long way. Here's how your support will help push the game further:</p>
<ul><li>With 5,000$ CAD, I will be able to cut out my part time work to spend most of my time developing Deuce without distractions, thus accelerating the progress of the game and ensuring a higher quality product. This amount is an accurate representation of how much I will need to obtain in order to pay for external work such as artistic commissions (audio, graphic, etc.) in addition to my own living expenses for about a year. IndieGoGo also takes a cut from the profit I make and I must also repay the artists who have helped me so far.</li></ul>
<p>However, it is possible that I will obtain more than the required amount of funding and I fully intend to give my supporters as much bang for their buck! Here is a list of what I will do with extra support from the community:</p>
<ul>
<li>$5,000 - Full game release. </li>
<li>$7,500 - Extra enemies and types. </li>
<li>$10,000 - Different tile/map types (Hexagonal, octogonal, triangular). </li>
<li>$15,000 - Ports to consoles. </li>
<li>$20,000 - Extra bosses with original sound tracks. </li>
<li>$30,000 - I'll hire extra artists for a higher quality product and quicker development. </li>
<li>$40,000 - Unlockable Co-op mode!</li>
<li>$50,000 - Difficulty levels!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Although I am a ""solo-developer"" I do intend on hiring additional help with the audio and visuals, but finding the right help isn't always easy. It's difficult to say how much help I will need with the project considering that the size and scope will change depending on the StrechGoal we hit.</p>
<p>Additionally, completing an entire game might seem like an impossible task for a ""solo"" developer, especially a student at that!</p>
<p>Fortunately, I'm surrounded by talented and helpful expert developers and teachers at Isart Digital! I'm never more than a few steps away from feedback and technical expertise in both design and programming. On top of all that, I study in a format that allows me to take 1 week off every second week for personal growth and development in the industry for the entire school year, which means I can dedicate myself to the development of Deuce.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>
<p>My campaign will be shared by myself on Facebook and LinkedIn. But since I don't have a Twitter account, I'm counting on you guys to help me get the word out there about Deuce!</p>
<p>Reddit and Discord servers are also a great idea to spread the love!</p>
<h3>Get in contact with me!</h3>
<p>I absolutely <strong><i><u>Love</u></i></strong> to hear your feedback! And I'm always open to suggestions and ideas to improve!</p>

(impresión, materiales y manipulación) y gastos de envío. Únicamente para el objetivo básico, se necesitan 1800€ 
para producir 500 copias de<b><i> CSW: FLESH AND STEEL</i></b>, la expansión del juego de tablero. Un fondo adicional de 200€ será destinado al pago de comisiones para la plataforma de mecenazgo y las transacciones bancarias. <br/><br/><p>Además de este, se han propuesto objetivos secundarios que podrían aumentar la calidad y cantidad de los componentes del juego para nuestros mecenas. Por ejemplo, si la financiación alcanzara cantidades entre 3500€-10000€, se desbloquearía un nivel para la producción de miniaturas o la impresión de un libro de reglamento más completo. <br/></p><p><b>Vedra Games</b>, la compañía involucrada en este proyecto, 
ya publicó con éxito <i><b>COLONIAL SPACE WARS: NEW HORIZONS</b></i> en el pasado.

This project is developed by Vedra Games, an Spanish game publisher and organizer of gaming events. In COLONIAL SPACE WARS the action takes place in a future science fiction universe. Each player take the role of one Commander, leading his army and 
challenging others 
in a desperate massive ground battle. Only a leader that excels in strategic 
planning, military tactics and resource management will prevail. The 
future of the universe ruled by men is in your hands!.  COLONIAL SPACE WARS : NEW HORIZONS was released as a starter box in English and Spanish. It includes a rulebook with 56 full color pages, a portable game board 
with two different battlegrounds, 50 tokens on laminated cardboard as 
units, and 10 markers. This compact format is suitable for casual gaming with a duration of 
30-60 min, but it also allows bigger battles with up to eight armies 
when combining two or more boxes. Game  mechanics combine chess with 
classic wargames, with the particularity 
of being played without dice. Based in resource management, tactics and 
strategy, COLONIAL SPACE WARS is easy to learn but hard to master. The rulebook of COLONIAL SPACE WARS : NEW HORIZONS  is available for free download here:COLONIAL SPACE WARS: NEW HORIZONS (ENGLISH)Now, thanks to your support, it is possible to take a new step in COLONIAL SPACE WARS history. With  FLESH AND STEEL
 we can expand the options and possibilities of this stunning wargame. 
To achieve this goal, the campaign is divided in two parts:

 contribution of potential backers during this campaign, we want to 
achieve the funding to publish a first edition of the expansion, which 
would give many game lovers worldwide access to this interesting and fun
 board game.This project is not only important because it will expand the universe of COLONIAL SPACE WARS, but also 
because it offers new and unique rewards that will only be available 
during the campaign.To learn more about CSW: FLESH AND STEEL, visit this blog:http://gamerandcommander.blogspot.com.esAnd do not hesitate... your men are waiting for orders, Commander!.Vedra Games invested an important budget in order to pay previous costs for this project (author rights, 
payments to illustrators, sculptors and editor). Therefore the
 total funding received from this campaign only will pay the board game production costs: brute 
(printing, components and handling) and shipping. Only for the basic goal, we will require 1800€ 
for the production of 500 copies of CSW: FLESH AND STEEL, the board
 game expansion. An additional 200€ budget in terms of commissions for the 
companies that manage the bank account transactions.In
 addition to this, the secondary goals are alternative proposals that could improve even more the 
quality and quantity of game components for our backers. For example, if the funding 
reached values between 3500€-10000€, it would unlock a bonus that allows production of resin/metal models or the printing of an advanced rulebook. Vedra Games, the company involved in this project, 
has edited successfully CSW: NEW HORIZONS in the 
past. For this reason, our capacity to professionally and efficiently 
manage a project like this is guaranteed. This campaign will as well 
expand their reach to potential clients and reinforce the trust of their
 current customers.To fulfill the challenge of the multidisciplinary working areas of this project (terrain, traditional sculpting, 3D printing and model production) , other specialist companies has been involved as a partnership: WEBSITE ENCOBERTURA WEB RESINLAB MODELSWEB XAN MINIATURESDuring these past years all of them offered excellent services in their own areas. Thank to this, Vedra Games has created a deluxe networking partnership that guarantees superior quality products. The COLONIAL SPACE WARS FLESH AND STEEL campaign will last 21 days. During this period, backers are invited to join by  pledging with different perks knowing as Commander Ranks (see section below). Each perk will require the compromise of
investing a certain amount of money; the higher is this level, the greater
amount of additional Tactical Resources (rewards) to choose from.In any case, backers should remember that no charges would be applied in case the minimum required 
was not reached.The Commander Ranks available are the following:The Tactical Resources are exclusive rewards you can select, up to a limit established by the Commander Rank you apply for (See Commander Ranks above).We
 would be grateful if those who cannot support us with funds could help 
by spreading the word to the community of players. If you want to know

Por lo tanto la totalidad de la financiación obtenida de esta campaña únicamente será invertida en pagar los costes de producción del juego de tablero: básicos 
(impresión, materiales y manipulación) y gastos de envío. Únicamente para el objetivo básico, se necesitan 1800€ 
para producir 500 copias de CSW: FLESH AND STEEL, la expansión del juego de tablero. Un fondo adicional de 200€ será destinado al pago de comisiones para la plataforma de mecenazgo y las transacciones bancarias. Además de este, se han propuesto objetivos secundarios que podrían aumentar la calidad y cantidad de los componentes del juego para nuestros mecenas. Por ejemplo, si la financiación alcanzara cantidades entre 3500€-10000€, se desbloquearía un nivel para la producción de miniaturas o la impresión de un libro de reglamento más completo. Vedra Games, la compañía involucrada en este proyecto, 
ya publicó con éxito COLONIAL SPACE WARS: NEW HORIZONS en el pasado. Por esta razón, su capacidad para realizar eficaz y profesionalmente un proyecto de estas características está garantizado. Esta campaña servirá también para ampliar el número de sus potenciales clientes y mejorar aún más la confianza de los actuales, lo que enriquecerá a la comunidad de jugadores de COLONIAL SPACE WARS.  Para responder al reto que suponen las areas de trabajo multidisciplinar de este proyecto (escenografía de terreno, escultura tradicional, impresión en 3D y producción de miniaturas), se ha creado una red de trabajo con otras empresas especialistas: PÁGINA WEB ENCOBERTURA PÁGINA WEB RESINLAB MODELSPÁGINA WEB XAN MINIATURESDurante estos últimos años todas ellas han ofrecido unos servicios de 
calidad excepcional en sus respectivas áreas. Gracias a ello, durante 
esta nueva ""aventura"" en el mundo de las miniaturas, Vedra Games contará con unos colaboradores de lujo que asegurarán cumplir unos excelentes niveles de calidad en sus productos. La campaña de COLONIAL SPACE WARS FLESH AND STEEL durará 21 días. Durante este período, los mecenas están invitados a unirse a ella solicitando alguno de los diferentes niveles, denominados Rangos de Comandante (ver sección siguiente).

<p><strong>Inspiration</strong></p>
<p>One can say that the idea was brought up already in kindergarten. Kuba, along with his pal Tomek, invented a game where you tell stories based on randomly selected hand-made images. The games raised an abundance of emotions and were never boring. Plethora of funny stories were created, albeit none of them was ever recorded. Such a pity. After several years we decided to change this and develop an electronic version of our game. This is how we came up with mobile version of Tello - Tell Your Story.</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/P1-uT-0V1_s?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p><strong>Tello - Tell Your Story! Game description</strong></p>
<p>Tello - Tell Your Story is a mobile game where you spontaneously tell stories based on randomly selected images. The made-up story is recorded during the game. Thus, you can edit it afterwards and even add a musical background. The final result is an original film that you can share with the world or save in your mobile phone as a kind reminder. What kind of story are you going to create? That we do not know, but we are curious.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Thematic packages</h3>
<p>In tello app there will be some thematic packages, for example survival, horror, detective, sport, music, house, people, celebrity, animals, ocean, si-fi, fantasy, etc...</p>

<p style=""text-align: right;"">Horror</p>
</div><div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3>Boost your brain skills</h3>
<p>Tello is a game that both entertains and stimulates creativity. The challenge here is posed by the limited time-bar (33 seconds) and the fact that you never know what image will come next. The more thematic packages you use the more interesting and surprising you stories become. A great challenge will be to create stories in a foreign language, rapping or singing the story out. All this depends on the invention of the players.  See how much you can do.</p>

<h3>Feedback</h3>
<p>Several months ago we attended PixelHeaven 2017 – an independent games fair event in Warsaw - where we received a lot of positive feedback that motivated us to take up further actions.</p>
<p>“I hope this will be a new social media phenomenon.”</p>
<p>“It could be nice to play on home-parties.“</p>
<p>“I appreciate the design aspect of the game.“</p>
<p>“More active game of puns.”</p>
<p>“Ideal warm-up for stand-up performers.”</p>
<p>“Great for the elderly people too.""</p>
<p>“I would show it to teachers.”</p>
<p>We received support from the youngest ones as well. Kids fell in love with Tello and thus gave us a lot of images as souvenirs.That is why we decided to develop a special version of the game – Tello Kids. All animation will be developed based on children’s drawings selected by means of competition.</p>

<h3>Tello Kids</h3>
<p>Some games that children play develop skills that will come in handy during their adult life. One of the most important aspects is to develop imagination for it helps us cope in each and every situation as well as create remarkable things. Thanks to Tello Kids, we can stimulate creativity and spontaneity of children and furthermore - integrate whole families and lots of friends.</p>
<p>Children are thrilled the most when they can listen to and view their works. They aim at telling better stories each time they play and try using more difficult words as well as form more complex sentences. This is how a literary genius might be born in front of parents’ eyes.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Inspiration
One can say that the idea was brought up already in kindergarten. Kuba, along with his pal Tomek, invented a game where you tell stories based on randomly selected hand-made images. The games raised an abundance of emotions and were never boring. Plethora of funny stories were created, albeit none of them was ever recorded. Such a pity. After several years we decided to change this and develop an electronic version of our game. This is how we came up with mobile version of Tello - Tell Your Story.
 

Tello - Tell Your Story! Game description
Tello - Tell Your Story is a mobile game where you spontaneously tell stories based on randomly selected images. The made-up story is recorded during the game. Thus, you can edit it afterwards and even add a musical background. The final result is an original film that you can share with the world or save in your mobile phone as a kind reminder. What kind of story are you going to create? That we do not know, but we are curious.

 
Thematic packages
In tello app there will be some thematic packages, for example survival, horror, detective, sport, music, house, people, celebrity, animals, ocean, si-fi, fantasy, etc...
 

Survival
 
Horror

 
Boost your brain skills
Tello is a game that both entertains and stimulates creativity. The challenge here is posed by the limited time-bar (33 seconds) and the fact that you never know what image will come next. The more thematic packages you use the more interesting and surprising you stories become. A great challenge will be to create stories in a foreign language, rapping or singing the story out. All this depends on the invention of the players.  See how much you can do.


 

Who are we?

Feedback
Several months ago we attended PixelHeaven 2017 – an independent games fair event in Warsaw - where we received a lot of positive feedback that motivated us to take up further actions.
“I hope this will be a new social media phenomenon.”
“It could be nice to play on home-parties.“
“I appreciate the design aspect of the game.“
“More active game of puns.”
“Ideal warm-up for stand-up performers.”
“Great for the elderly people too.""
“I would show it to teachers.”
We received support from the youngest ones as well. Kids fell in love with Tello and thus gave us a lot of images as souvenirs.That is why we decided to develop a special version of the game – Tello Kids. All animation will be developed based on children’s drawings selected by means of competition.
 




 
Tello Kids
Some games that children play develop skills that will come in handy during their adult life. One of the most important aspects is to develop imagination for it helps us cope in each and every situation as well as create remarkable things. Thanks to Tello Kids, we can stimulate creativity and spontaneity of children and furthermore - integrate whole families and lots of friends.
Children are thrilled the most when they can listen to and view their works. They aim at telling better stories each time they play and try using more difficult words as well as form more complex sentences. This is how a literary genius might be born in front of parents’ eyes.

Education - Learning through play
 
If our project succeeds, we will aim at transferring it into schools. This version will be prepared for teachers so as to allow them to use it during classes. Most of all, we will focus on developing a model for learning foreign languages. We will introduce various mini-games from which the teacher will be able to select the right one. For example – naming images for beginners and telling entire stories in a foreign language for children with more advanced command.​
Objectives of the authors
We wish to finish our mobile game Tello - Tell Your Story. We have been working on it for over a year now. So far, we have completed a test version suitable for ios. We also aim at developing a version for Android and Apple TV. We also aim at developing special versions dedicated to children (Tello Kids), teachers (Tello Education) and blind persons. However, in order to complete our project we require not only time but also resources to employ new specialists, conduct educational researches and develop the application even further. We need your support to succeed!  As a means of thanks for the money you donated, you can be sure that we will supply you with various types of rewards.

<h2><strong>About MoDaCo.SWITCH</strong></h2>
<p>MoDaCo.SWITCH is not a custom ROM. It sits atop a ROM to offer a whole new approach to using multiple custom ROMs. In the past if you wanted to run different ROMs on your device - for example Samsung TouchWiz and stock Android or CyanogenMod - you'd have to manually flash between them and set up your data again every time you switched - certainly not ideal. SWITCH resolves this problem.</p>
<h1><strong>Multiple ROMs, one set of data</strong></h1>
<p>The core feature of MoDaCo.SWITCH is the ability to maintain one set of data between multiple custom ROMs. Switching from the heavily modified manufacturer ROM to the stock Google ROM? No problem, all your apps - and most importantly the <em>settings</em> for all your apps - will still be maintained. Just carry on using your phone!</p>
<h1><strong>Simple switching, simple updating, community support</strong></h1>
<p>With MoDaCo.SWITCH you don't have to boot into your recovery image and mess around flashing different ROMs... the Switch app does it for you. One click - 'Do you want to switch?' - and the device reboots to your new ROM in a process that's barely longer than a regular boot.</p>
<p>Updating to a newer version of SWITCH is simple courtesy of the built in over-the-air update mechanism powered by <a href=""http://www.otaupdatecentre.pro/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">otaupdatecentre.pro</a> - a service sponsored and supported by MoDaCo.</p>
<p>A forthcoming SWITCH companion app will help you manage aspects of SWITCH, and a SWITCH kitchen (Switchen?) for MoDaCo premium members (also included with some pledges) allows you to turn on and off different bits of ROM functionality as desired.</p>
<p>If you need support for SWITCH, head on over to <a href=""http://www.modaco.com/forum/717-htc-one-m7/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the support topic on the MoDaCo forums</a> for peer to peer help (and help from us of course).</p>

<h1><strong>Proven success</strong></h1>
<p>The campaign to bring MoDaCo.SWITCH to the Samsung Galaxy S4 i9505 comes on the back of the HTC One release, which has been critically acclaimed and widely used. You're not buying into an idea, you're buying into a product that's being successfully used by thousands of people on a similar device already.</p>
<h1><strong>What is the funding paying for?</strong></h1>
<p>This campaign is designed primarily to fund test devices to develop the software on. It's also an interesting way to gauge interest in the product. Of course, a massive amount of time is spent on this kind of project too which isn't covered by the funding target.</p>
<p>Often development is done for fun and to further the community, but there are always real physical and considerable time costs involved.</p>

<p>I originally put Daytrader on Kickstarter, and I was successfully funded. I'm filled with gratitude to say due to all the amazing attention Daytrader gained from kickstarter it's now bigger than a project, it's turned into a full blown business! So, where's the money going, you ask?</p>
<p>The first thing to know is Daytrader will be made, but, I'd like to increase the size of the first run to be able to put a game in the home of everyone who has shown an interest outside of the original campaign.

<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>First of all, Daytrader is an extremely FUN game. I believe that entertainment can bring the masses together. Its my goal to get this game into as many homes, places of work and parties as possible so it can add a little fun, laughter and create some great memories to all whom play it.</span></p>
<p><span>Also, I feel there is a lack of  practical economic education in our school systems. I believe a game like this will benefit many high school students preparing for college and life, as well as, adults much like myself that seek more knowledge of the basics of investing.  It also serves to fill the void many expert investors may have with the lack of choices modern board games offer. I've spent a lot of time making sure that Daytrader has a simple enough mechanic to allow anyone from 10 to 99, musician to businessman, 99% to the 1% participate, laugh and maybe even learn something.</span></p>
<p>I'm also working towards educational versions for teachers that will allow students on the high school and college levels, as well as, working professionals learn the fundamentals in a more in concrete way by playing with different sets of rules that better reveal the topics and concepts introduced in Daytrader.</p>

I believe a game like this will benefit many high school students preparing for college and life, as well as, adults much like myself that seek more knowledge of the basics of investing.  It also serves to fill the void many expert investors may have with the lack of choices modern board games offer. I've spent a lot of time making sure that Daytrader has a simple enough mechanic to allow anyone from 10 to 99, musician to businessman, 99% to the 1% participate, laugh and maybe even learn something.
I'm also working towards educational versions for teachers that will allow students on the high school and college levels, as well as, working professionals learn the fundamentals in a more in concrete way by playing with different sets of rules that better reveal the topics and concepts introduced in Daytrader.

  What We Need & What You Get 
We need $15,000-$20,000 to start the project and buy all the things you will interact and see in the game.

The people who support our project will get special gifts, gear, early access, ect.



  Risks & Challenges 
Sense we are a small and this is a very large project, it may take a while to see progress, but we promise we will produce a game worth waiting for.
 There is a way to overcome that issue which is to help production by posting ideas talking to one of us in the team to see you can help out produce the game by doing modeling or scripting mainly anything could do but we need money to even start work and recruitment.
 
  MMO Concept


Within the multi-player game you can go on adventures find new islands buy new ships and capture camps off of other players.
You can take up roles in the online game such as smuggling, trading, adventuring, assassinating and much more! If you choose one role it doesn't mean you can't change at any point, you can always decide a different way of playing the game! 
You can also hire an NPC crew that you can capture islands with or just get a few friends together and play that way.


Other Ways You Can Help If you can't put money into our project or help with game design you can help by telling people about the game and you can do that by using Indiegogo share tools.",4.0,0,"2 Campaigns

likely encountered the pervasive, negative notion that people who play video
games are wasting their time and should be doing something “more productive”
instead.  The effect on gamers everywhere—especially
young ones—is widespread embarrassment and downward social pressure around an
activity that they love.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is not NEARLY as widespread is the understanding that playing video
games actually presents numerous benefits and the passion should be supported.</p>
<p><b></b></p><p><b>Twin Galaxies is on a mission to raise awareness that avid gaming is a worthwhile, socially acceptable, and important activity that’s deserving of more understanding and support. </b>To accomplish this,we are raising funds for the specific things listed below:</p><ul>
<li>A new <b>social media website platform</b> module with features tailored exclusively for video game players to get greater recognition and exposure.</li>
<li>A <b>mobile app</b> to increase access, participation and mobile gaming recognition within the Twin Galaxies system.</li>

</p><p><b>We have been working hard, but can’t get to the finish line on our own.
</b>For the small cost of a T-Shirt, and your strong word of mouth, you can help us
raise $250,000 and move us toward completion on all of the above as quickly as
possible.</p><p>At the very core of our beliefs is the idea that <b>we all have the #Right2Game</b> without being culturally shamed, and that we should collectively foster a social climate where gamers feel comfortable considering the career options, mental and physical health benefits, and meaningful social connections that the video game space provides.</p><p>All of our initiatives aim to accurately represent the spirit
of gaming as a fun, healthy, and ultimately rewarding activity that should not
be frowned upon and discouraged.</p>

likely encountered the pervasive, negative notion that people who play video
games are wasting their time and should be doing something “more productive”
instead.  The effect on gamers everywhere—especially
young ones—is widespread embarrassment and downward social pressure around an
activity that they love.

What is not NEARLY as widespread is the understanding that playing video
games actually presents numerous benefits and the passion should be supported.
Twin Galaxies is on a mission to raise awareness that avid gaming is a worthwhile, socially acceptable, and important activity that’s deserving of more understanding and support. To accomplish this,we are raising funds for the specific things listed below:
A new social media website platform module with features tailored exclusively for video game players to get greater recognition and exposure.
A mobile app to increase access, participation and mobile gaming recognition within the Twin Galaxies system.
Live streamed events, programs and competitions broadcasted through our media network Twin Galaxies Live at www.tglive.com .



We have been working hard, but can’t get to the finish line on our own.
For the small cost of a T-Shirt, and your strong word of mouth, you can help us
raise $250,000 and move us toward completion on all of the above as quickly as
possible.At the very core of our beliefs is the idea that we all have the #Right2Game without being culturally shamed, and that we should collectively foster a social climate where gamers feel comfortable considering the career options, mental and physical health benefits, and meaningful social connections that the video game space provides.All of our initiatives aim to accurately represent the spirit
of gaming as a fun, healthy, and ultimately rewarding activity that should not
be frowned upon and discouraged.
But in order for
our planned efforts to reach success, we need your support. We’re calling on gamers everywhere to join
us in our fight for the 

As for what you get, we’ve already teased monumental and unprecedented collector’s items offered as perks at the highest donation tiers: Rick Fox’s 3 back-to-back NBA World Championship Rings, Jamie Lee Curtis’s famous little black dress from True Lies, Christopher Guest’s original Nike shoes and other items from This is Spinal Tap and a Hulk comic that was not only signed by Stan Lee, but used as a key prop on The Jace Hall Show.But in between the big ticket items and basic perks of knowing you’ve contributed to a worthwhile cause — we’ve received encouraging support from premium gaming apparel companies EIGHTY SIXED ( www.eightysixed.com )and J!NX ( www.jinx.com ), game companies UBISOFT and WB GAMES, and our friends at NERDIST INDUSTRIES that allows us offer many more unique incentives to express our sincere appreciation for your support of our mission. TWIN GALAXIES™ has been supporting and celebrating the achievements of gamers since its founding in 1981, and has served as an official video game world record and player ranking authority, celebrating video game enthusiasts and their achievements with published recognition in national magazines and books, award ceremonies, broadcast events, and by maintaining a public database of video game leader-board accomplishment.
We are excited to have resounding celebrity support for our cause
and our goals, from 3-time NBA Champion RICK
FOX, to JAMIE LEE CURTIS &
CHRISTOPHER GUEST, creator of Mortal Kombat ED BOON, music producer and former ""American Idol"" judge RANDY JACKSON, and even comic book legend STAN LEE — many of whom have donated RARE items that are available
as perks to help raise funds for our initiatives to endorse gamers.
Together, our goal is to transform public perception so that those
who achieve in the area of video games—whether it’s playing them well,
designing them, or growing communities around them—will be as respected and
encouraged as those who achieve in sports, music, or any other cultural area
where people choose to invest their time and efforts.

 Hello, my name is Bill Hays and I'm the designer, inventor, maker and ""chief bottle washer"" at Pocket Predator Slingshots... and I want to personally invite you to join in on the final couple of legs in our largest expansion to date! 
 </p><p>
 We have been contacted by our mold making company and they're ready to start on our molds... They should be all finished in at the most 6 weeks... it would be faster but we have a lot of molds and some are fairly complex too.
<br/>But anyway, we're going to use the IndieGoGo crowdfunding site to take preliminary orders and try to recoup some of the over $100,000 we've invested in this project already... and with tax season being upon us, we really could use a little breathing room!
<br/>So if you're wanting one or more of the new models the quickest way possible, in time for the spring and early summer shooting sessions, then help us out a little now and that will be the best way to assure you get yours before the peak demand season!
</p>
<p></p><p>
</p><p>
<b>For those who don't know us already, here's a little background:</b>
</p><p>
Pocket Predator Slingshots has been in business for about 5 1/2 years and already we're largely responsible for a huge shift in the way slingshots are viewed, with major worldwide gains in overall accuracy, versatility and strength. Our original Ergonomic designs allowing for vastly increased comfort and consistency... along with our many unique and versatile attachment methods which allow for a greater variety of elastics and aiming possibilities means huge gains in overall accuracy... While at the same time the materials the slingshots are made from allow the actual strength of the elastics to be increased if so desired as well. With our many and varied original slingshot concepts and designs along with our over 200 youtube videos and many other people learning, understanding and taking inspiration from those designs and videos, many making their own slingshots and videos as a result... We've been fortunate to be one of major seeds of inspiration that's grown into a beautiful tree and is now the beginnings of a forest!
</p>
<p>
How far we've come would take to long write about right here, right now... but here's a few examples anyway: 
<br/>Five years ago it was considered an incredible, almost world class feat if a person were able to hit a soda can 10 times in a row from 10 meters or further... and feats such as cutting cards or lighting matches, the stuff of legend and theory. Nobody could do them. Not one youtube video or other verifiable proof existed.... Now days, with our modern designs and shooting concepts it's considered a very easy task to hit a can 10 times in a row... and cutting cards, using our methods and concepts, not really hard to do at all... Lighting matches with your slingshot, the ultimate proof of accuracy? Well, there have been over 50 people so far on youtube and other online video sources who've proven they can shoot that accurately using our concepts and design innovations! As for tournaments and other competitions, what many consider ""the crucible for proof of concept""... Here in the USA and in the UK, EVERY major tournament and competition won, in the last 3 years, has been won by somebody using our design concepts, outside the forks banding methods and or shooting principals we at Pocket Predator Slingshots pioneered and developed since the beginning of our being in the slingshot business!
 </p>
<p></p><p>
 
 
 
Okay, after all of that what are we talking about then? After over three years, over $100,000 invested so far and over 1000 man hours between us, our engineers and patent attorney... We have basically settled on SEVEN different slingshot designs to begin with... Seven designs that fit the majority of beginner to experienced users needs... AND three highly unique and patented accessories that will help to bring new users into ""the game"" as well.


 
 </p><p>
</p><p>
</p>
<img border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.pocketpredator.com/igg/HTS.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
<p>
 
 
 
First up, we have updated one of the favorite slingshots of the modern era... The Hathcock Target Sniper! Named for the greatest Sniper of the Vietnam era, Carlos N. Hathcock, this slingshot is one that helped to launch and maintain the whole ergonomic slingshot movement. With it's highly intuitive and extremely consistent hold style due to the finger/ thumb grooves and the neutral wrist position because of the canted handle that allows for easier band alignment in a side hold... Many shooters, whether they be highly experienced or new to the scene, consider this design to be a classic and a favorite. 



 
 </p><p>
</p>
<img border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.pocketpredator.com/igg/Scorp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
<p>
 
 
 
Next we have the Scorpion! The Scorpion happens to be my personal favorite design. It's hallmarks include a triple canted ergonomic frame, so you naturally point at your target in a relaxed position.... and a positive hand filling grip area that is designed to support your thumb to forefinger all the way out to the web... and a handle area that fills the hollow of your palm. The Scorpion is truly one of the most ergonomic slingshots of all time, and that ergonomic advantage allows for more stability, more comfort and greater shot to shot consistency... In fact the Scorpion design is THE first design in the modern era to show that match lighting, even with today's harder to light matches, is not only possible... but actually a fairly easy and common feat that can be done by many. 



 
 </p><p>
</p>
<img border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.pocketpredator.com/igg/SERE.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
<p>
 
 
 
This next slingshot is the SERE. I could write volumes about this slingshot... but I'll try to keep it short. SERE basically stands for survive evade resistance and escape... All military pilots and crew who fly over enemy territory are trained in SERE techniques at one of several specialized schools in the United States... and about 3 years ago we were approached by SERE instructors from the Washington State school about the viability and usefullness of a slingshot in the ""ditch bag"" that pilots carry with them in the case of being shot down and having to use SERE tactics until being rescued. At first I wasn't to gung ho about the idea... Thinking that a small caliber silencer equipped firearm with extra ammo would be a better choice... but after some persuation I did come around to their way of thinking. So what was needed was a highly versatile slingshot that is extremely easy to use... it needs to be able to use many types of elastic, shoot all kinds of different ammo types and sizes, including arrows... and yet be small enough to included in the ""ditch bag"" in the first place. Seeing that our existing Hammer Takedown model slingshot with multiple modular fork types already fit most of those requirements, we simply went with a skeletonized and reduced size version of that... then over the course of several months of trying various things out back and forth... small mods here and there.. The SERE in 6061 aircraft grade aluminum was born. From that strictly utilitarian military version comes the  SERE in Polycarbonate! 
</p><p>
Note some of the defining characteristics of this new and improved design... The much deeper and inherently more stable interchangable forks and fork mounting recess.... necessary, we found, because although polycarbonate is very strong it's still not as strong as aircraft grade aluminum. Now look at the fork to handle fastening design... never a worry about vibration induced loosening of the forks, simply due to the double wrap around THROUGH the fork closure system. Next, the frame's grip is canted forward like a high end target pistol grip... that allows for the thumb muscle to attain a more natural hold and promotes natural point and shoot accuracy. Lower, the two finger grooves... your two strongest fingers naturally pull the frame deep into your hand while the tapering of the frame allows for the ring finger and pinky to balance out the grip for an extremely comfortable and easy to use hold. Then down to the picatinney rail... you can mount a reel for bowfishing, or a flashlight for night hunting... or BOTH if you want to bowfish at night... the rail is just long enough!
</p>
<p>
In short every part of this slingshot has been thoroughly tested in a variety of uses and situations... and it's been found to perform above expectations in every way. In fact after we gave away some of the prototypes at tournaments last year... it wasn't to long before some of our competitors announced they were going to come out with their own versions!


 </p>
<p></p><p>
</p>
<img border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.pocketpredator.com/igg/RangerTAC.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
<p>
 
 
 
Up next we have the Ranger TAC with an over the top (OTT) band configuration. This particular design has been requested by many for it's pocketable size and the fact it's designed for a forefinger and thumb braced hold. A lot of old timers, Europeans and hunters prefer a symmetrical OTT design that's still ergonomic and comfortable to use all day long... and this slingshot fits that bill perfectly! 



 
 </p><p>
</p>
<img border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.pocketpredator.com/igg/TopShotStandard.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
<p>
 
 
This next one is the TopShot... designed with a backward cant to the handle that allows comfortable ergonomic shooting in a forks up OR forks to the side hold... this frame is preferred by many who like to shoot with the fork in an upright fashion yet still prefers the ergonomically superior forefinger and thumb braced grip on the frame itself. Since introducing this design about 4 years ago, this slingshot has become very popular in the UK and many parts of Europe.... Since it is very concealable and ready to use at a moment's notice it's commonly referred to as a ""poacher"" design in the UK. 



 
 </p><p>
</p>
<img border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.pocketpredator.com/igg/Hammer.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
<p>
 
 
The TAC Hammer slingshot! There's just a not a lot that needs to be said about this slingshot... one look at it and it's obvious it means business and that it's going to be fun and easy to use as well... Most people who are just beginning with slingshots and haven't been around a lot of slingshot shooters, automatically try to hold pretty much all slingshots like this one is obviously designed for. This slingshot is designed for everybody from a beginner to the most experienced shooter there is.... it has our universal forks, a wide and forgiving fork gap width and of course is made from one of the most impact resistant materials out there! 


 
 </p><p>
</p>
<img border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.pocketpredator.com/igg/SideShooterUni.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
<p>
 
 
The last full slingshot have for right now is the universal sideshooter. This slingshot is an improved version of the Boyscout model that we give away to scouting organizations. It's small enough to be used by an average 9 year old boy, but even an older person with much larger hands can use it as well. Designed to be used in a sideways hold only, it's one of the easiest slingshots with which to learn the fundamentals of shooting. 



 
 </p><p>
</p>
<img border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.pocketpredator.com/igg/BFclamps.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
<p>
 
 
Now I want you to check these out.... These are our bifurcated shaft quick banding clamps... We call them ""alien clamps"" for short, because of the mouth within a mouth look of the final designs. These will be able to be used on any of the slingshots we have that have a hole in the universal forks, or on anybody else's slingshot that has a 5/16"" diameter X 3/4"" long hole in the forktip. No tools will be required to change out bands and what's more is you can use your slingshot as a makeshift band tying jig by using these as well... so if you're in the field and you want to make up a bandset or something... then you're not out of luck... your slingshot itself can be your jig!

<p>
 
 
Since we're talking about clamps and so forth... up next are our patent pending rod locking clamps, we call them gator clamps, and they will allow any standard 1/4"" rod slingshot... like those in the big box stores, to shoot with flatbands in the preferred one line shooting method with no tied on or jumbled up looking bands... plus they will allow you to fix them in any orientation you wish... OTT, TTF or anything in between... With these you will be able to use any custom size or weight of band... train a child how to shoot with rubber-band strength bands and airsoft ammo... Then, in a few seconds you can take those bands off, change to some heavier bands... and you're able to go out and ""soda can"" hunt with the far more efficient and powerful flatbands you've always wanted when you go out to do that. What these clamps do is they take a simple and cheap rod frame slingshot and turn it into something you could easily compete and win with in a tournament. So soon, when a person asks ""what's the best slingshot for a beginner?"" The answer will be simple... buy the least expensive slingshot you can find at the store, put gator clamps on it, and you're all set! 
</p><p>
These rod clamps and the bifurcated shaft clamps from before, are so unique, so groundbreaking in their design, that when the patent searches for prior art were conducted... there was simply nothing else to compare them to... So what we have done here is we actually created a couple of entirely new TYPEs of clamps... needless to say, that was more than a little amazing to the guys who conducted the searches in Washington DC!

And the last thing we'll be bringing out for now? Our Patented Quick attach archery plates that will allow you to take a cheap rod framed, tube equipped slingshot from the big box store and in about 10 seconds convert it to a slingbow that's just as powerful and accurate as all but the highest end, most expensive slingbows out there... and of course if you take a minute or so to tinker with it a little, cutting the tubes to the right draw ratio and installing the plugs we invented for making a fast attach bowstring... the converted ""Walmart special"" can then be just as powerful and maybe even MORE accurate as even the highest priced slingbow models! You see, through trial and error we figured out something early on... and that is those tubes and pouches on the store bought slingshots are not very good for REAL accurate shooting with standard ball ammunition... but if you set them up to shoot arrows, they're actually pretty darn hard to beat! </p><p>&lt;b&gt;</p><p>

</p><p></p></div>","Here's the Deal!

 
 Hello, my name is Bill Hays and I'm the designer, inventor, maker and ""chief bottle washer"" at Pocket Predator Slingshots... and I want to personally invite you to join in on the final couple of legs in our largest expansion to date! 
 
 We have been contacted by our mold making company and they're ready to start on our molds... They should be all finished in at the most 6 weeks... it would be faster but we have a lot of molds and some are fairly complex too.
But anyway, we're going to use the IndieGoGo crowdfunding site to take preliminary orders and try to recoup some of the over $100,000 we've invested in this project already... and with tax season being upon us, we really could use a little breathing room!
So if you're wanting one or more of the new models the quickest way possible, in time for the spring and early summer shooting sessions, then help us out a little now and that will be the best way to assure you get yours before the peak demand season!



For those who don't know us already, here's a little background:

Pocket Predator Slingshots has been in business for about 5 1/2 years and already we're largely responsible for a huge shift in the way slingshots are viewed, with major worldwide gains in overall accuracy, versatility and strength. Our original Ergonomic designs allowing for vastly increased comfort and consistency... along with our many unique and versatile attachment methods which allow for a greater variety of elastics and aiming possibilities means huge gains in overall accuracy... While at the same time the materials the slingshots are made from allow the actual strength of the elastics to be increased if so desired as well. With our many and varied original slingshot concepts and designs along with our over 200 youtube videos and many other people learning, understanding and taking inspiration from those designs and videos, many making their own slingshots and videos as a result... We've been fortunate to be one of major seeds of inspiration that's grown into a beautiful tree and is now the beginnings of a forest!


How far we've come would take to long write about right here, right now... but here's a few examples anyway: 
Five years ago it was considered an incredible, almost world class feat if a person were able to hit a soda can 10 times in a row from 10 meters or further... and feats such as cutting cards or lighting matches, the stuff of legend and theory. Nobody could do them. Not one youtube video or other verifiable proof existed.... Now days, with our modern designs and shooting concepts it's considered a very easy task to hit a can 10 times in a row... and cutting cards, using our methods and concepts, not really hard to do at all... Lighting matches with your slingshot, the ultimate proof of accuracy? Well, there have been over 50 people so far on youtube and other online video sources who've proven they can shoot that accurately using our concepts and design innovations! As for tournaments and other competitions, what many consider ""the crucible for proof of concept""... Here in the USA and in the UK, EVERY major tournament and competition won, in the last 3 years, has been won by somebody using our design concepts, outside the forks banding methods and or shooting principals we at Pocket Predator Slingshots pioneered and developed since the beginning of our being in the slingshot business!
 

 
 
 
Okay, after all of that what are we talking about then? After over three years, over $100,000 invested so far and over 1000 man hours between us, our engineers and patent attorney... We have basically settled on SEVEN different slingshot designs to begin with... Seven designs that fit the majority of beginner to experienced users needs... AND three highly unique and patented accessories that will help to bring new users into ""the game"" as well.


 
 




 
 
 
First up, we have updated one of the favorite slingshots of the modern era... The Hathcock Target Sniper! Named for the greatest Sniper of the Vietnam era, Carlos N. Hathcock, this slingshot is one that helped to launch and maintain the whole ergonomic slingshot movement. With it's highly intuitive and extremely consistent hold style due to the finger/ thumb grooves and the neutral wrist position because of the canted handle that allows for easier band alignment in a side hold... Many shooters, whether they be highly experienced or new to the scene, consider this design to be a classic and a favorite. 



 
 



 
 
 
Next we have the Scorpion! The Scorpion happens to be my personal favorite design. It's hallmarks include a triple canted ergonomic frame, so you naturally point at your target in a relaxed position.... and a positive hand filling grip area that is designed to support your thumb to forefinger all the way out to the web... and a handle area that fills the hollow of your palm. The Scorpion is truly one of the most ergonomic slingshots of all time, and that ergonomic advantage allows for more stability, more comfort and greater shot to shot consistency... In fact the Scorpion design is THE first design in the modern era to show that match lighting, even with today's harder to light matches, is not only possible... but actually a fairly easy and common feat that can be done by many. 



 
 



 
 
 
This next slingshot is the SERE. I could write volumes about this slingshot... but I'll try to keep it short. SERE basically stands for survive evade resistance and escape... All military pilots and crew who fly over enemy territory are trained in SERE techniques at one of several specialized schools in the United States... and about 3 years ago we were approached by SERE instructors from the Washington State school about the viability and usefullness of a slingshot in the ""ditch bag"" that pilots carry with them in the case of being shot down and having to use SERE tactics until being rescued. At first I wasn't to gung ho about the idea... Thinking that a small caliber silencer equipped firearm with extra ammo would be a better choice... but after some persuation I did come around to their way of thinking. So what was needed was a highly versatile slingshot that is extremely easy to use... it needs to be able to use many types of elastic, shoot all kinds of different ammo types and sizes, including arrows... and yet be small enough to included in the ""ditch bag"" in the first place. Seeing that our existing Hammer Takedown model slingshot with multiple modular fork types already fit most of those requirements, we simply went with a skeletonized and reduced size version of that... then over the course of several months of trying various things out back and forth... small mods here and there.. The SERE in 6061 aircraft grade aluminum was born. From that strictly utilitarian military version comes the  SERE in Polycarbonate! 

Note some of the defining characteristics of this new and improved design... The much deeper and inherently more stable interchangable forks and fork mounting recess.... necessary, we found, because although polycarbonate is very strong it's still not as strong as aircraft grade aluminum. Now look at the fork to handle fastening design... never a worry about vibration induced loosening of the forks, simply due to the double wrap around THROUGH the fork closure system. Next, the frame's grip is canted forward like a high end target pistol grip... that allows for the thumb muscle to attain a more natural hold and promotes natural point and shoot accuracy. Lower, the two finger grooves... your two strongest fingers naturally pull the frame deep into your hand while the tapering of the frame allows for the ring finger and pinky to balance out the grip for an extremely comfortable and easy to use hold. Then down to the picatinney rail... you can mount a reel for bowfishing, or a flashlight for night hunting... or BOTH if you want to bowfish at night... the rail is just long enough!


In short every part of this slingshot has been thoroughly tested in a variety of uses and situations... and it's been found to perform above expectations in every way. In fact after we gave away some of the prototypes at tournaments last year... it wasn't to long before some of our competitors announced they were going to come out with their own versions!


 




 
 
 
Up next we have the Ranger TAC with an over the top (OTT) band configuration. This particular design has been requested by many for it's pocketable size and the fact it's designed for a forefinger and thumb braced hold. A lot of old timers, Europeans and hunters prefer a symmetrical OTT design that's still ergonomic and comfortable to use all day long... and this slingshot fits that bill perfectly! 



 
 



 
 
This next one is the TopShot... designed with a backward cant to the handle that allows comfortable ergonomic shooting in a forks up OR forks to the side hold... this frame is preferred by many who like to shoot with the fork in an upright fashion yet still prefers the ergonomically superior forefinger and thumb braced grip on the frame itself. Since introducing this design about 4 years ago, this slingshot has become very popular in the UK and many parts of Europe.... Since it is very concealable and ready to use at a moment's notice it's commonly referred to as a ""poacher"" design in the UK. 



 
 



 
 
The TAC Hammer slingshot! There's just a not a lot that needs to be said about this slingshot... one look at it and it's obvious it means business and that it's going to be fun and easy to use as well... Most people who are just beginning with slingshots and haven't been around a lot of slingshot shooters, automatically try to hold pretty much all slingshots like this one is obviously designed for. This slingshot is designed for everybody from a beginner to the most experienced shooter there is.... it has our universal forks, a wide and forgiving fork gap width and of course is made from one of the most impact resistant materials out there! 


 
 



 
 
The last full slingshot have for right now is the universal sideshooter. This slingshot is an improved version of the Boyscout model that we give away to scouting organizations. It's small enough to be used by an average 9 year old boy, but even an older person with much larger hands can use it as well. Designed to be used in a sideways hold only, it's one of the easiest slingshots with which to learn the fundamentals of shooting. 



 
 



 
 
Now I want you to check these out.... These are our bifurcated shaft quick banding clamps... We call them ""alien clamps"" for short, because of the mouth within a mouth look of the final designs. These will be able to be used on any of the slingshots we have that have a hole in the universal forks, or on anybody else's slingshot that has a 5/16"" diameter X 3/4"" long hole in the forktip.

So soon, when a person asks ""what's the best slingshot for a beginner?"" The answer will be simple... buy the least expensive slingshot you can find at the store, put gator clamps on it, and you're all set! 

These rod clamps and the bifurcated shaft clamps from before, are so unique, so groundbreaking in their design, that when the patent searches for prior art were conducted... there was simply nothing else to compare them to... So what we have done here is we actually created a couple of entirely new TYPEs of clamps... needless to say, that was more than a little amazing to the guys who conducted the searches in Washington DC!

Demo DownloadPlatforms: Weaving Tides will be released on Steam for Windows & Mac and Nintendo Switch. Check out our Steam coming soon page and feel free to add us to your wishlist!  Weaving Tides will be available in seven languages: English, German, Russian, Japanese, Spanish, French and Simplified Chinese. We will also keep our ears open to your requests. If there is enough  interest we will do our best to translate Weaving Tides to even more  languages.Some of our biggest influences: The Legend of Zelda Series, Bastion & TearawayWeaving Tides is influenced by a cluster of our combined interests and the things we love, but among our greatest inspirations are the Legend of Zelda series, Bastion and Tearaway. Our takeaways from these games are:
An epic adventure filled with challenges like in the Legend of Zelda  

A beautifully crafted story and lush, vivid environments like in Bastion 

Creative Puzzles and witty interactions with your surroundings like in Tearaway 

All of the mechanics in Weaving Tides are inspired by textile crafting techniques. The Weaver dragon you ride has a “ribbon tail” that flows behind it as you fly. It serves a variety of purposes and is the key to completing the challenges of the woven world.Using the Weaver's ribbon allows you to complete magical stitching patterns, pull down hovering chests, drag heavy rugs, pull open curtains and more. Sometimes the solution lies hidden somewhere close by, other times you will have to explore the mechanics of the puzzle further in order to solve it. Use your imagination and puzzle-solving skills to overcome these challenges and advance on your journey.The world is filled with secrets and optional puzzles. Find them and your curiosity will be rewarded with new clues revealing the mysteries of the world or useful new items.While the primary focus of Weaving Tides lies in the narrative, as well as puzzles and exploration, it also offers laid-back, fun combat mechanics.  Every enemy will require you to adopt a different strategy in order to defeat it.    While, for example, the Toothy Yappers have to be flipped onto their backs by resurfacing right beneath them or dashing through them…    ...the moles have to be pulled out of their dens before you can stitch or dash them.The combat in Weaving Tides is challenging, but not overwhelming.  If it turns out to be too easy for you, you will be delighted by the various opt-in modifiers in forms of items which will toughen up your foes.   Once you’ve mastered these skills, explore dungeons to put them to the test! We have three dungeons waiting for you: a forgotten desert temple, a mind tangling forest maze and a dangerous lair which has yet to be unveiled!And of course at the end of each dungeon a boss is waiting for you!  Experience a sprawling, strange new world full of adventure and secrets. In this world Tass seems to be the only one of his kind - a human. Accompanied by his foster dad Kilim he sets out to solve the mysteries of his past. But the world he calls home is changing in dark, unexpected ways, and a force that once lay dormant beneath the weave is awakening.   Weaving Tides is a tale about finding a sense of belonging. The story is told in a light-hearted way sprinkled with charming characters and witty puns, but at its core it is a rich and emotional narrative about family, identity and the blurred lines of morality.   Travel across the four unique layers of the woven world. Each layer has it’s own culture, aesthetic, puzzles and dangers. This strange world is inhabited by intelligent beings called ""the Mothkin"", moth people with human-like features and a predominantly friendly nature. Explore the sun-drenched dunes of the Silken Desert, home to small nomadic villages such as your hometown, Veteri.Lush, dense & dangerous, the Spun Forests are home to the tribal Mothkin who are strict believers of the great mother Dea.The Mothkin empire is a stronghold of trade and culture. Blessed by a moderate climate the Mothkin of the empire express their love for their land by growing beautiful, well-trimmed gardens.Some speak of barren landscapes ravaged by relentless storms and hidden deep beneath the lustrous cities of the empire. Unknown things lurk down there; all we know for certain is they mean us no good.The Weavers are the guardians of the woven world. Even though most Weavers are loners, three of them will join you in your quest and will invite you to ride on their backs. Each one of the Weavers behaves slightly different. While Twill has a higher movement speed, Luce can take more hits, for example - but their greatest difference lies in their special stitching abilities. It is up to you to use the Weaver best suited to your current situation, or you could just use whichever Weaver you like best!Kilim's special move allows him to cover a wide area, perfect for patching up large rips and slowing down groups of enemies. Twill spits her ribbon in a straight line and can therefore precisely remove single threats without having to move into dangerous zones herself.  When Luce’s special move is unleashed he rushes forward, stitching and cutting everything in his path. Great for breaking through walls of enemies; not so great at avoiding painful obstacles. Although you will find some items by simply exploring the world and uncovering secret areas, some of the most sought after ones can only be bought from Salis the flying merchant.   You gain Thread Essence by patching up tears in the world and by unsealing chests. Use the essence to buy magical embroidered patches which will greatly help you on your journey.A small selection of the magical emroideries you will find on your journey.Some of the items will be opt-in modifiers for folks that want an extra challenge: to give the enemies, say, more health in exchange for larger rewards.  Sometimes a Mothkin will entrust you with a letter to a loved one, other times you might find a ripped scroll of parchment stuck between the branches of a terry-tree. Collect these writings if you wish to delve deeper into the lore and mysteries of the woven world.Capable explorers will find ways to reach even the most remote areas of the woven world. There you will find enchanted ribbons which can be used exclusively in Playground mode. Collect them all to create a stunning masterpiece of digital embroidery! Weaving Tides' Playgrounds mode invites you to create your own digital artwork. In this mode you can choose from a variety of ribbons, including those you unlocked in Adventure mode. There are also some helpful special features:

I loved the concept of this game so much that I wrote an entire 150 page novel to really bring the JBS world alive, after several years of revisions and edits to the draft I thought about publishing it. Considering I know the story inside and out from what I envisioned it was more of a video game/anime then a book. So with that JBS for the PC was born, starting from scratch it is where it is today because of how much I love this story.</p><p>I also expanded on the JBS world and wrote two sequel books that not only bring you into more brand new worlds but continue where the story left off each book, pulling you in and making you want more!</p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;"">JBS is already well into development, and you can check out the latest <b>Beta v1.8</b></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">(<b>caution, this game is not intended to be easy</b>)</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><br/></p><h1>Try the <i>BETA</i>: </h1><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><a href=""http://www.indiedb.com/games/just-beneath-the-skin/downloads"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/463115/files/20140326194300-web-banner.gif?1395888180"" src="""" style=""width: 584.2285714285714px; height: 72px;""/></a></p><h4><i><b><br/></b></i></h4><h4 style=""text-align: center;"">

For me this is what video games represent, something to conquer by gaining skills, you see the challenge is what is most thrilling for me and most people I would assume. </p><p>I wanted to bring games back to where they used to be, hard, hard and fun yet rewarding, without having to have a full <i>3D interface</i> to enjoy it. Remember <i>Ninja Turtles</i> for<b> NES</b>? How about <i>Aladdin</i> for <b>Sega</b>? These titles bring one thing to mind for me, <b>SKILL!</b> As you had to have skill to <i>play</i> or even <i>beat</i> these games. Not just that but these games did have bugs and perhaps there were things we didn't like about the game. Still we played anyways and for years we will continue to play, in any video game we play and adapt to the environments that are presented to us. </p><p>With JBS it's all about <i>adapting to the environment</i> as it may change continuously and if you don't pay attention, you may get lost or confused, which is where the </p><p>""<b>Acquiring Skill</b>"" mode comes into play.</p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/462665/files/20140326155606-header_950x150.jpg?1395874566"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><h1 style=""text-align: center;"">What will you find in JBS?</h1><p><br/></p><p><i>So what's in JBS</i>? Puzzles, puzzles, puzzles, I love puzzle games as well as horror/survival but JBS isn't a horror game so I went with a more ""surreal"" experience to compensate. Dreamy and beautiful environments surround you only to keep you from the absolute truth, nothing in JBS is as it seems, at least almost nothing..... </p><p>Besides puzzles there are many foes that Shyla must fight against in order to survive as she progresses on her journey. You see in order for the God inside Shyla to gain energy, Shyla must <b>draw blood</b> and never stop. As the game progresses you will be able to transform into Caldon (<i>the ancient alien God inside of Shyla</i>) during battle and use his extreme powers to surpass all who stand in their way. </p><p>So we have <i>puzzles, fighting and very deep plot</i>?

Seven years later a stranger comes to her father from the woods, soon Shyla will begin a journey that will take her into a world she never could have imagined, a world far beyond her comprehension and far beyond limiting conceptions. For Shyla, there is a long road ahead, for those who have been watching her since birth, there is a long wait ahead and for the God that is living inside of her body, well for him, his long wait is over.He will use Shyla to be re-birthed into existence and once again try to rule the universe. The question is…. Will Shyla be able to stand up to the tests that are coming her way? Will she fulfill her destiny? Or will she be consumed by the darkness...?In due time all the answers will fall into place...JBS first started as a book idea, when I was younger I would write away in my notebook story ideas/plots and extend on them if I liked the base. I loved the concept of this game so much that I wrote an entire 150 page novel to really bring the JBS world alive, after several years of revisions and edits to the draft I thought about publishing it. Considering I know the story inside and out from what I envisioned it was more of a video game/anime then a book. So with that JBS for the PC was born, starting from scratch it is where it is today because of how much I love this story.I also expanded on the JBS world and wrote two sequel books that not only bring you into more brand new worlds but continue where the story left off each book, pulling you in and making you want more! JBS is already well into development, and you can check out the latest Beta v1.8(caution, this game is not intended to be easy)Try the BETA: 
BETA Gameplay: 

2 hours + worth of gameplay (depending on player).
Is in BETA stages but everything should run smoothly. 
This game only works on windows so please keep that in mind before downloading, if you come across any issues feel free to message me.Why RPG old school style?In the era that I grew up in I played video games that were extremely hard, not only were they hard but you actually had to acquire a decent amount of skill to pass each level or a group of skills to beat a whole game. For me this is what video games represent, something to conquer by gaining skills, you see the challenge is what is most thrilling for me and most people I would assume. I wanted to bring games back to where they used to be, hard, hard and fun yet rewarding, without having to have a full 3D interface to enjoy it. Remember Ninja Turtles for NES? How about Aladdin for Sega? These titles bring one thing to mind for me, SKILL! As you had to have skill to play or even beat these games. Not just that but these games did have bugs and perhaps there were things we didn't like about the game. Still we played anyways and for years we will continue to play, in any video game we play and adapt to the environments that are presented to us. With JBS it's all about adapting to the environment as it may change continuously and if you don't pay attention, you may get lost or confused, which is where the ""Acquiring Skill"" mode comes into play.What will you find in JBS?So what's in JBS? Puzzles, puzzles, puzzles, I love puzzle games as well as horror/survival but JBS isn't a horror game so I went with a more ""surreal"" experience to compensate. Dreamy and beautiful environments surround you only to keep you from the absolute truth, nothing in JBS is as it seems, at least almost nothing..... Besides puzzles there are many foes that Shyla must fight against in order to survive as she progresses on her journey. You see in order for the God inside Shyla to gain energy, Shyla must draw blood and never stop. As the game progresses you will be able to transform into Caldon (the ancient alien God inside of Shyla) during battle and use his extreme powers to surpass all who stand in their way. So we have puzzles, fighting and very deep plot? Interesting combination eh? What else is in here? Oh you know just stuff that most people who play RPG's love, check the features section below for full details and example images.Jeremy Solares                           Game Designer, Graphic Designer, Multi-Media ProducerI go by Tsuyoi Raion in many places, I am indie designer who has experience in many different fields. Always having a curiosity in any form of art, I tend to grab hold of anything I can learn in order to master everything as they would say. As an indie designer I know how important it is to be good at many different things, with eighteen years of computer experience and knowledge in over three hundred plus programs I hold myself up pretty well against competitors.I have at minimum 8 years in the professional business field doing marketing, production, sales, etc. which leads me to be an entrepreneur of all sorts. I love video games, they are truly a part of my life as I grew up with games everywhere and still to this day can't fathom not having games in my life. Not only has gaming created something so capturing but it has opened opportunities to have friends who enjoy the same games or i can battle with online. Gaming has opened doors that were closed for me and even more so now that Indies are stepping into the spotlight more and more, because of this I know if not anything else, at least indie video games will be designed and supported fully by the gamers. Luna EltoHired artist (Character Art)Luna is an aspiring artist who is currently attending College to become a professional artist, I happen to find Luna through a friend of mine after falling in love with his work. Since then the character art for JBS has skyrocketed finally giving the game that nice feeling all around. Luna wishes to do all he can to help the game progress and has even offered to do the art for the 2nd and 3rd game for JBS. Looks like we have a keeper ladies and gentlemen! I have been self funding this project for the past year and now I need your help!! I want to bring you a great game to play and in order to do that I need to be able to fully focus on the production of this game, I believe a great game comes from hard work, dedication and continuous focus. With your help I can bring this game alive in 6 months or less!  So please help me to help you... jump into the world of JBS and beyond!!Last year I threw a Kickstarter that raised almost $1,000!! Unfortunately my goal was $5,000 and I did not receive any of the donations. I could have really used that money and was bummed about it but hopefully those of you who contributed last run are willing to donate once again and this time I will get it! Where Your Money GoesBeing an indie dev. means you either have the skill to make whatever it is you need OR hire outside sources to accomplish those things for you. For me, I have hired an outside hand for the character designs as well as a coder here and there for certain aspects of the game (in game menu, etc.).For the hard work these people have contributed I have promised due payment, your contributions will help in getting these hired hands what they deserve! Check below in the Characters section to see what the new artist has contributed to the game! I recently decided I was going to add in a small voice over role for Shyla here and there throughout the game, for this I have found a voice actress whom I have paid already for the parts she has already done. I would like for her to continue doing voice over for Shyla in the game, your contributions will also go towards paying for her services. ProgressionFor the most part the general feedback from the gamers in the most recent BETA releases were they loved the game but felt the character art really hurt the games appeal. The character designs have changed a few times since the creation of JBS but I realized what I had prior wasn't what I was really looking for. So Upon finding the new hired artist I feel content with the character art now and have confidence the gamers will too!Below is progression sheets for the characters that are currently finished, not all characters are complete as of right now but will be coming soon.ShylaThe DoctorMr. CrowNatalieThese are just a few examples of progression sheets for the characters, below is detailed information for each character that is available as of now.Character InfoMore Coming soon...

I want to take a moment and thank all those youtubers who are doing great things by playing the games we work so hard on and enjoying them.

</div><h3>What Is Turf Battles?</h3><p>Turf Battles is a 3D MMORPG unlike any other. It holds a very large emphasis on the PVP Aspect of games that makes it quite the riveting and exciting experience. Players are able to progress their characters rather quickly and engage in territorial battles against other players, either by themselves or with members of their Tribe(Guild). These battles determine ownership over Turfs that are inhabited by monsters that, when killed, drop valuable items used in upgrading character items and skills. Players must defend the Turfs from invading Tribes (Guilds). Although character progression is important, it is not the deciding factor in a battle. Players can hone their skills by cutting and stacking their skills together, much like with combo's. Skills have 0 cast time, and only a very few skills have cool downs. </p><p>Turf Battles was released in America, but unfortunately it was later shut down. To those of you who played Turf Battles, you know of the riveting and exciting game play I'm speaking of. You probably have even followed the game through it's multiple failed versions, and even tried to play other MMORPG's. However I bet no other MMORPG but the original Turf Battles has ever given you the form of satisfaction and enjoyment that Turf Battles did. The thrill of performing time sensitive combinations of attacks, movement, and jumping in order to defeat enemy players in all out war simply does not exist in any other MMORPG.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3 style=""font-weight: bold;"">What We Propose</h3><p>We are rebuilding the original Turf Battles. This is not a new game, it is not going to have changes to the games system. It will be Turf Battles, the game we all know and love. The game we all spent hours upon hours having fun, making friends, and even arguing in the PVPChannel.</p><p>It will have cutting, stacking, combo's, you will be able to hold over 1000 potions, players will be able to PvP in all the areas they were able to in the original version. Quests such as the Roof Top Hop will return to the game. Monsters that have long been unseen, such as the Turtoid Lord, will return. Equipment and Skills will have the original requirements, stats, and abilities. Weapons such as Eonic Weapons, Stun and Mana Steal Weapons, Leni Steal weapons, etc will return. Players will be able to earn PK Points in order to be on the PK Rankings on our website. I can go on, but that would be kind of point less. You must have gotten the point by now.</p><p><b>We are bringing back Turf Battles, </b>the only game that has ever been good enough to actually continue playing for over 9 YEARS!</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3>Who Are We?</h3><p></p><p>We are group of players that have been playing Turf Battles and all of its versions since 2005. We have team members that work on different aspects of the game. Such as a Graphic Designer, Web Developer and Designer, Programmers, etc. Each member has had a tremendous amount of experience in his/her field.

That being said the purpose of this campaign is to raise enough money to allow the members of our team to work on Turf Battles full time for a period of time. </p><p>We will also be using left over money to host our Test Server, when that time comes, as well as to pay our web hosting fees.</p><p>Basically, the money raised will ensure that there will always be people working on Turf Battles, because it will be our jobs. We may even be able to find room in the budget to outsource some work to other developers in order to speed up the development process.</p><p></p><p>Everyone that donate's will be thanked by each member of our team, as well as having their names listed on our websites Donor List. If you would not like to be listed on the Donor List, you simply need to ask us not to list your name.</p><p>On top of our thanks, because we know thanking you could never be enough. We are offering various perks to people that donate, the value of these perks goes up as the player donates more. As well a player receives all the perks above his perk price. </p><p><b>For Example</b></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">If you donate 60 USD, you will get the following perks:</span></p><p></p><ul>

Equipment and Skills will have the original requirements, stats, and abilities. Weapons such as Eonic Weapons, Stun and Mana Steal Weapons, Leni Steal weapons, etc will return. Players will be able to earn PK Points in order to be on the PK Rankings on our website. I can go on, but that would be kind of point less. You must have gotten the point by now.We are bringing back Turf Battles, the only game that has ever been good enough to actually continue playing for over 9 YEARS!Who Are We?We are group of players that have been playing Turf Battles and all of its versions since 2005. We have team members that work on different aspects of the game. Such as a Graphic Designer, Web Developer and Designer, Programmers, etc. Each member has had a tremendous amount of experience in his/her field. We have all been working hard to make this dream, that the entire Turf Battles Community has been wanting since it shut down in 2008, a reality.You can learn more about the team on the about us page of our website.What We Need?A very large amount of work has already been put into the project prior to this campaign being started. Between now and the end of the campaign we will be uploading various screenshots, videos, and development diaries of our progress. These can all be viewed here or on our website. It is our hope that we update the community on a weekly bases.However, our team is not the biggest group of people. We all have lives, families, jobs, and bills to pay. That being said the purpose of this campaign is to raise enough money to allow the members of our team to work on Turf Battles full time for a period of time. We will also be using left over money to host our Test Server, when that time comes, as well as to pay our web hosting fees.Basically, the money raised will ensure that there will always be people working on Turf Battles, because it will be our jobs. We may even be able to find room in the budget to outsource some work to other developers in order to speed up the development process.Everyone that donate's will be thanked by each member of our team, as well as having their names listed on our websites Donor List. If you would not like to be listed on the Donor List, you simply need to ask us not to list your name.On top of our thanks, because we know thanking you could never be enough. We are offering various perks to people that donate, the value of these perks goes up as the player donates more. As well a player receives all the perks above his perk price. For ExampleIf you donate 60 USD, you will get the following perks:

Beginner's Luck


Deal of a Life Time


Not So New Begginings


Beta Tester


Pet Master


Alpha Member

The Tardy Early Bird
If we reach our goal, we believe that the game will be able to be released for Beta Testing as early as September, maybe even earlier. If you have any questions or concerns about the campaign, please feel free to post them on our forums. A member of our team will be more then happy to answer them.Can't Donate?We understand that some people just can't contribute, due to personal reasons. That's okay, but if you still want to help you can do so by bringing awareness to the our campaign.

<h3>The Scoop</h3>
<p><strong>(VIDEO COMING IN THE NEXT 48 HOURS!)</strong></p>
<p>Mortifera Incident is a online MMORPG that is a tecxt based RPG enhanced by graphics and audio. The game has been a personal project for over a year now, and is finally coming together. It is a world of virtually unlimited scale, and makes players not only learnt to fight of the Zombie horde, but to actually survive, and realize the human factor of such an apocalypse.</p>
<p> <strong>The Lead Developer</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">My name is Jordon, and I'm a 24 year old residing in Michigan, USA. I have been developing websites and web based programs since I was 18. I am knowledgeable in HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, JQuery, and AJAX.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Along with being a well-rounded programmer, I am a avid gamer. I have always been attracted to this genre, and I always found that every game I tried always came up short in some way, shape, or form. Thus the idea of Mortifera Incident was born.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Mortifera Incident<br/></strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">This game has been my brain-child, and it has really evolved into something special over the many months of planning, coding and development.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">The game will allow players to spawn into a post-apocalyptic world that is over 225 million square miles of dynamically generated, fully destructible terrain.

<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">The reason we are reaching out for funding is pretty simple and straight-forward. We are looking to raise money to support the accelerated launch and sustainment of the game. These costs include the following:</p>

<li>Sound Costs (Music Provided By ConnorORT)</li>
<li>Initial Awareness Campaign Costs</li>

<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">In a nutshell, I am the primary code monkey for this project. I do have the help of a couple of close friends who are adding in when they can, but we are doing this around full-time work schedules. The funding will not only help us appropriate a dedicated server to launch from, but allow us to get some funds to Connor and Adam (Who I must mention have been more than generous in helping us get some content together to show you fine folks) so they can get the ball rolling on the art and music scene, to help us but together a bit of funding for an initial marketing campaign (So you have people to play the game with!), and of course to help allow us coders to allot some more time to the project.</p>

<div>Now we are going to take a moment to quickly hit on approximately how much of the set goal amount will be going towards which items, and the kinds of things we are offering to our generous donators.

<h3>Caravaneer 2</h3>
<p>Caravaneer 2 is the second part of a free browser-based post-apocalyptic RPG game with trading elements and turn-based battles. You can play the first part here: <a href=""http://www.gamesofhonor.com/caravaneer"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.gamesofhonor.com/caravaneer</a></p>
<p>The game has several aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transporting goods between towns and dealing with economy</li>
<li>Fighting bandits who try to rob you</li>
<li>Story and dialogues which involve all other aspects and more</li>
</ul>
<p>The second part is planned to be much bigger than the first one. It'll have better graphics, a bigger story and a whole lot of new features, such as slavery, morale, a possibility to own businesses etc.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Author</h3>
<p>Dmitry Zheltobriukhov, the author of this game has been in browser-based games business for almost 10 years now. He's responsible for the creation of a dozen of Flash games and two game sites: Sugar-Free-Games.com and GamesOfHonor.com</p>
<h3>Funding</h3>
<p>This is a one person game and there will not be many expenses, except, maybe, for music and a couple of other small things. However, this game is relatively big and the only person working on it needs a lot of time to finish the project. He needs to receive some sort of salary duing this time, and that's what the money will be spent on. It's hard to tell how much money is needed exactly. The more will be raised, the more time I will have and the better the final product will be.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<p>Even though some people think of crowdfunding as some sort of selfless donation, it's not exactly true. Contributors receive valuable rewards in exchange for their money. In the case of Caravaneer 2, all rewards are absolutely unique and there's no other way to receive them other than helping with the game development. It's an excelent chance for Caravaneer fans and game enthusiasts to lay their hands on some exclusive stuff.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>There are other ways to help the project other than money. You could share a link to this page ton social networks, or you could also volunteer to help translate the game into your language, be a beta tester or do something similar.

<p class=""p3""><strong>The Campaign.</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">We want to raise $70,000 to complete the SportsLab iPad app and launch a pilot test for McClymonds High School. The money will go to:  </p>
<ul class=""ul1"">
<li class=""li4"">Develop app from prototype to version 1.0 release on the Apple App store.</li>
<li class=""li4"">Purchase 25 iPads to do a pilot test with McClymonds High School.</li>

<li class=""li4"">And, of course, purchase and deliver our rewards for our backers: You!</li>
</ul><p class=""p1"">We've analyzed every detail of the project. The amount we raise will deliver a solid foundation to outfit teams and help all athletes play smarter. </p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Update: </strong>We are now proud to be working with Oakland High School. A portion of the funds raised here will also go towards a pilot test with their team.</p>
<p class=""p3""><strong>Why McClymonds High School?</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">We chose to outfit McClymonds' football team with the pilot test of our SportsLab product because these guys have real heart. The school has been an important part of the Oakland, California community with some notable alumni (Bill Russell, MC Hammer, Senator Nicholas Petris, to name a few) and a storied history of facing adversity in a disadvantaged environment. Poverty and violence festers in this community. People like Malcom X and Muhammad Ali have promoted their message of progress on campus. McClymonds makes a difference in education with the means they have and the community around them. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Now, SportsLab wants to use technology to add to this progress.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The priviledged can afford most new technology. Our project challenges this reality. We can help change the mindset of underpriveledged student athletes by outfitting them with iPads and SportsLab technology to show them that smart preparation both on and off the field is the key to success and a better life.</p>
<p class=""p1"">We need your help to make this happen!</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Technology &amp; Education Supports Success</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Our studies show that teams who use the web version of the SportsLab product retain 30% more strategy and preparation for their efforts on the field. Just like studying for a test, SportsLab helps teams prepare properly for gameday.</p>
<p class=""p1"">We want to outfit the teams with the next generation of the SportsLab product, which will be an ecosystem of iPads running the SportsLab app. It will allow teams to manage their team strategy, data, stats, calendars and rosters all on our seamless cloud system.</p>
<p class=""p1"">If this mobile app gets created, then your team will have the chance to own the right tools to play smarter and win better.</p>
<p class=""p3""><strong>Who are we?</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Noman and Monty are the co-founders of SportsLab. After growing up in Oklahoma and Texas, football has stitched into the fabric of their lives. Now they work in the SF Bay area, and they see how technology positively impacts life experiences and education. Their vision is to empower athletes to have technology that makes a positive impact in their lives.</p>

It was easy for people in urban areas to find a half-dozen arcades within their area, and even rural areas had a few machines. These days, though, arcades are becoming something of a dinosaur. Home consoles have been serving up a nearly-arcade-quality experience for over a decade, and as a result, the player base for arcade games dwindled. <img alt=""A typical grungy arcade"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i48.tinypic.com/ne7oky.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""Would YOU want to play here? - Image copyright Ryan Duffield, used under Creative Commons license""/>In an effort to retain their customer base, many arcades switched over either to specialty machines that required special control schemes that couldn't be easily replicated at home (gun games and rhythm games, in particular), or quarter-gobbling “ticket redemption” games. Some few arcades tried to stay true to their roots, and most of those have gone out of business. And many of the locations that still have machines are dirty, and their machines are in poor repair.</span><br/><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"">But there's one arcade experience that cannot be replicated on a console at home - pinball. While virtual pinball games like <a href=""http://www.pinballfx.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pinball FX2</a> and <a href=""http://pinballarcade.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pinball Arcade</a> do an astounding job of replicating the look and general physics of pinball games, by their very nature they cannot, and will not, ever replicate the tactile feel of playing pinball. Pinball fans know that the tactile sense is a very important part of playing pinball!</span></p>

There are a few arcades in the Los Angeles area that have some pinball machines, and a few dozen bars, bowling alleys, and pizza joints that have one or two. But there’s only one in all of Los Angeles County that focuses on pinball, and that one is focused more heavily on the much older electro-mechanical machines, rather than the newer (and more popular) solid state games. To play the more recent games, you either have to search them out one by one across the region, go north to the Bay Area for an annual pinball convention, or much farther northeast to Las Vegas for the <a href=""http://www.pinballmuseum.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Pinball Hall of Fame, Las Vegas, NV"">Pinball Hall of Fame</a> (which I recommend to any pinball fan anyway). </span></p>

As our fundraising efforts have largely failed, we're pulling the plug a little early. Please do not donate at this time. We're still working on trying to make this arcade happen, but clearly an IndieGoGo campaign is not the way to do it. Please read the last two Updates for more information. If you're still interested in helping make this happen, then please join our Facebook Group to keep abreast of our progress. 
 
ALERT - PLEASE READ THE ABOVE FIRST
 
Once upon a time, video arcades littered the landscape. It was easy for people in urban areas to find a half-dozen arcades within their area, and even rural areas had a few machines. These days, though, arcades are becoming something of a dinosaur. Home consoles have been serving up a nearly-arcade-quality experience for over a decade, and as a result, the player base for arcade games dwindled. In an effort to retain their customer base, many arcades switched over either to specialty machines that required special control schemes that couldn't be easily replicated at home (gun games and rhythm games, in particular), or quarter-gobbling “ticket redemption” games. Some few arcades tried to stay true to their roots, and most of those have gone out of business. And many of the locations that still have machines are dirty, and their machines are in poor repair.
But there's one arcade experience that cannot be replicated on a console at home - pinball. While virtual pinball games like Pinball FX2 and Pinball Arcade do an astounding job of replicating the look and general physics of pinball games, by their very nature they cannot, and will not, ever replicate the tactile feel of playing pinball. Pinball fans know that the tactile sense is a very important part of playing pinball!
With that in mind, we want to bring the thrill of pinball back to our area. There are a few arcades in the Los Angeles area that have some pinball machines, and a few dozen bars, bowling alleys, and pizza joints that have one or two. But there’s only one in all of Los Angeles County that focuses on pinball, and that one is focused more heavily on the much older electro-mechanical machines, rather than the newer (and more popular) solid state games. To play the more recent games, you either have to search them out one by one across the region, go north to the Bay Area for an annual pinball convention, or much farther northeast to Las Vegas for the Pinball Hall of Fame (which I recommend to any pinball fan anyway). 

 
The Arcade
I intend to create a pinball arcade in the South Bay, ideally not too far from LAX, and therefore easily accessible for visiting pinball fans. This fundraising drive would help get the machines needed to properly stock the arcade. We are dedicated to providing a top-notch gaming experience for everyone who walks through our doors.
The arcade will be set up as an ""admission"" format. There will be a flat fee for entry, and all of the machines will be set up for free play. We will also have a small snack bar, of course. 
The general plan is to have two to four very new machines like Stern's X-Men and AC/DC; Four to six ""top-tier"" older machines in excellent condition, such as Twilight Zone, The Addams Family, Monster Bash, The Simpsons Pinball Party, and/or Star Trek: The Next Generation; and eight to twelve ""lower-tier"" pinball games, such as Road Show, The Machine: Bride of PinBot, Earthshaker (especially thematic for a SoCal arcade!), and The Getaway: High Speed II. Ideally, we want to have around twenty machines to start.  
If we can manage it before we launch, we intend to have every machine set up with a headphone plug - in addition to the normal speaker music and sounds, players will have the option to plug in their own headphones in order to be able to hear the table that they're playing clearer, blocking out background noise from the other machines. That will enable them to focus on the call-outs and audio cues that the machine gives them. 
If everything goes according to plan, we should be opening in Spring 2013. When we reach the initial goal of $100k, we will pay for six months' worth of lease on our space. Every 25k we go over that will add another six months to the lease, pre-paid - that means that if we hit, say, $150k, the arcade will be open for a bare minimum of a year and a half, guaranteed. We'll also have other guarantees and bonuses as we hit stretch goals, but we'll talk about that later. 

Who are we? Okay, so you want to know who ""we"" are. That's a fair question.I am Jason DuVall. I've been playing pinball and video games for my entire life.

Once the funding is well under way, we will have positions open for a webmaster and a technician. Once the project is running smoothly, we may have a few positions open for arcade staff, as well. 

Additional plans for the Arcade:As part of the purpose of this is to expose more people to pinball, we will be involving local charities, such as The Boys & Girls Clubs of Long Beach. In particular, 50% of the first month’s gross proceeds will be donated to the BGCLB, and 10% of net profits for months after the first will be donated to similar local children’s charities. We will, of course, be encouraging these charities to bring their kids out to play some pinball, too! 

 

In Closing:I realize that not everyone who is interested in pinball can donate here. Some people live too far away for it to matter, and some just can’t afford it.

Also, we want to make it clear that we are committed to seeing this project through, even if it takes several attempts to hit our goal.

<h2><strong>Welcome to the Comic Sutra fundraising page.</strong></h2>
<p>The Comic Sutra is an adult party game where teams of two people, while fully clothed, race through as many positions as possible before time runs out.  Sounds like a party people would never forget, right?</p>
<p>The game consists of 84 position cards (enough to play 3 rounds of increasing difficulty with 5 teams), instruction card, timer, and box. </p>

<p>We are Bobby, Kiel, and Bobby and Kiel's close friends and confidants.<br/><br/>Bobby is a Math/Business student who works in sales<br/><br/>Kiel is a Programmer finishing his CSE degree<br/><br/>We both love adventuring, coding, being nerds, and having fun. So that is what inspired this. It all began when the obvious childhood dream of playing Pokemon in real life was still everpresent at 20. However unrealistic it was to invent a ball that could capture and shrink deer and other natural wildlife; and then proceed to shoot them back out to normal size. I decided an application in which you photograph them and other nature-ly things could be very fun. The core ideas of this app are:<br/><br/></p>
<ul>
<li>""Capture"" Animals by photographics them and battle/level up/trade</li>
<li>Find beautiful landscapes and landmarks exploring to show to       others</li>
<li>Leave treasures and trinkets or maybe even more (A campsite!? who knows!) geocaching style for other users</li>
<li>See the stuff thats around you and meet people!</li>
</ul><p>Your photos are rated and identified by multiple other users if its an animal.

We are Bobby, Kiel, and Bobby and Kiel's close friends and confidants.Bobby is a Math/Business student who works in salesKiel is a Programmer finishing his CSE degreeWe both love adventuring, coding, being nerds, and having fun. So that is what inspired this. It all began when the obvious childhood dream of playing Pokemon in real life was still everpresent at 20. However unrealistic it was to invent a ball that could capture and shrink deer and other natural wildlife; and then proceed to shoot them back out to normal size. I decided an application in which you photograph them and other nature-ly things could be very fun. The core ideas of this app are:

""Capture"" Animals by photographics them and battle/level up/trade
Find beautiful landscapes and landmarks exploring to show to       others
Leave treasures and trinkets or maybe even more (A campsite!? who knows!) geocaching style for other users
See the stuff thats around you and meet people!
Your photos are rated and identified by multiple other users if its an animal. A good shot gets a capture, and a bad one just gets the wikipedia entry of the animal Pokedex style.If you want to go to a scenic area and take shots they can be rated by other users just like animal photos but you dont get a capture, you just get some points that we have to come up with a cool name for. Others can also explore and geocache in areas you have photographed and show you what they found there in case they may have come across something you didnt.This is a huge deal to me.

My wife and I have homeschooled our
four kids (college, high, middle, & elementary ages) since 1999.  Over the years, I've come across many different curriculums available for Christian-based
character education.  Frankly...
I have been underwhelmed with
what I’ve found.  
Most resources seem to have arbitrary
approaches, simplistic presentations, and incomplete lists of virtues.  So far, I’ve been unable to find one that
makes learning about virtues and character traits informative, systematic, and

The
Idea
Encouraged by my family,
for the last 5 years I’ve been working on my own approach to teaching
virtues.  Using all the information I
could find through as many sources as possible, I was able to come up with a comprehensive
list of 52 virtues.  Then through experimentation,
inspiration, and prayer, categorize and organize them into a structured system
that makes learning and remembering them easier. Best of all...
It works
perfectly as a card-based game, making learning virtues fun.  
It allows for playing any existing standard
52-card game with the Virtue Cards to expose the players to the concepts of the
virtues.  In addition, it allows for all
kinds of games that are specifically designed to be played with the cards and
teach the players about the virtues. 
Ultimately I hope to have many different games, themes, add-ons, and
extensions.

<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>In this massive distance game, the player takes a role as the commander who has to accompany Wallie. For this he has to help build the rocket, navigate through the atmosphere and make right decisions.</strong></p>

<p>Wallie to Space would be an enormous distance game not only among distance games made for mobile platforms, but it would aim for the spot of the best distance game ever!</p>
<p>Distance game is a game, where the objective is to get as far as possible in a single round. This means you have to raise your funds, either by collecting treasure, reaching achievements, completing quests, eliminating enemies etc., to upgrade your ride, which in this case is a rocket. Wallie to Space will feature upgrading not only your ride, but also the driver, who would be Wallie himself, and the entire world he is flying in. Perhaps you know games like ""Learn To Fly"" or ""Shopping Cart Hero"". I am trying to take distance games further in every aspect. Many new features, way longer gameplay, constant updates, exclusive content and what is more - you would not have to travel alone, not anymore. A huge interactive environment featuring online competitions, collectibles market, tournaments and much more will be accessible, therefore you are always connected to your friends and other people around the world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The whole idea behind flying to the space is to cover the whole Solar System. Whether to cross the barrier of gravitation, land on the mysterious Moon, feel the eternal power of Mars or discover a place never seen before would be up to a player. This would offer an immensely long gameplay along with a constant joy of discovery.</p>

<p><strong>Can I really fit this all in budget?</strong></p>

<p><strong>What if I will not reach my entire goal?</strong></p>

<p><strong>What about the team?</strong></p>
<p>The team will be hired. I would be a producer, designer and programmer. The team will consist of a sound engineer, a composer and two artists (one for paper sketches, one would be a computer artist). To reduce the cost, everything will be set up before hiring any workers. This is to avoid a moment when employees have nothing to do.<img alt=""About me"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i45.tinypic.com/3480rgk.png"" src="""" style=""font-size: 1.17em;"" title=""About me""/></p>

The project is already a step ahead of an idea, so you may question the preparation cost. So far I have treated it as a hobby project, meaning it is designed on a personal level and very unsecure. Preparation cost would cover its surefire security, dynamic backup system and proper development tools.</p>
<p><strong>Why am I so passionate about the project?</strong></p>
<p>I have been into game development since I was a little boy. My dream has always been to be a successful game developer and contrive unprecedented ideas. Wallie could literally bring me to the world. In addition to this, there is another reason I have to success in the computer industry. I have been disabled below my knees since I was born and have a limited range on the job market, precluding any physical activity requiring work. I am craving for your contribution, which would literally make my dream to be an honourable developer come true. I know, that achieving something set up that high will not be simple. but I am ready to take this journey of my life!</p>
</div></div>","Wallie is a rabbit, whose biggest dream is to explore the space. For this he has to build a rocket; however, many obstacles cross his path to the space and not everybody want Wallie to be the first rabbit to accomplish this.
In this massive distance game, the player takes a role as the commander who has to accompany Wallie. For this he has to help build the rocket, navigate through the atmosphere and make right decisions.

Wallie to Space would be an enormous distance game not only among distance games made for mobile platforms, but it would aim for the spot of the best distance game ever!
Distance game is a game, where the objective is to get as far as possible in a single round. This means you have to raise your funds, either by collecting treasure, reaching achievements, completing quests, eliminating enemies etc., to upgrade your ride, which in this case is a rocket. Wallie to Space will feature upgrading not only your ride, but also the driver, who would be Wallie himself, and the entire world he is flying in. Perhaps you know games like ""Learn To Fly"" or ""Shopping Cart Hero"". I am trying to take distance games further in every aspect. Many new features, way longer gameplay, constant updates, exclusive content and what is more - you would not have to travel alone, not anymore. A huge interactive environment featuring online competitions, collectibles market, tournaments and much more will be accessible, therefore you are always connected to your friends and other people around the world.
 
The whole idea behind flying to the space is to cover the whole Solar System. Whether to cross the barrier of gravitation, land on the mysterious Moon, feel the eternal power of Mars or discover a place never seen before would be up to a player. This would offer an immensely long gameplay along with a constant joy of discovery.



CROSS PLATFORM - play with your friends from other mobile platforms including Android, iOS and Windows Phone 8!


DOZENS OF FULL LENGTH MAPS in the unique open space system!


THOUSANDS OF UPGRADES; upgradable would be the rocket, the driver and every single map!


UNIQUE EVOLUTION SYSTEM - upgrading is not only a feature, but a part of the whole system. You can unlock new special abilities for your rocket, every of which requires skill to be used effectively. This capacitates a multidimensional upgrade system.


INTERACTIVE ENVIRONMENT - compete against your friends, share your achievements, trade rare collectibles!


EVENTFUL QUEST SYSTEM - every quest will be unique in its own way.


TROPHIES SYSTEM - find different collectibles, from antique ones to the memoirs of your most important victories!


OPEN DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM - players are involved in the project developing, take your chance to be a part of this truly epic mobile game!


          STAY IN TUNE FOR UPCOMING FEATURES!



However, this is relatively expensive. Everything from concept to delivery takes money.
 
Contribution distribution: (everything is thoroughly calculated)
  $1,500 - Preparations (to ensure security and proper backup system)
$31,000 - Code Engine (programming part)
$12,500 - Visual System (animations, models, art)
  $4,000 - Audio Engine (sounds, voices, soundtracks)
  $8,000 - Polishment for distribution (beta stage)
  $7,000 - Exclusive content for contributors 
  $5,000 - Campaign and payment processing fees
-----------
$69,000
 
Can I really fit this all in budget?
I have calculated precisely how much I need to complete the project. After the initial release, game development will be continued using the money raised from selling extra in-game content. Every feature promised here, though, will be left free for at least contributors.
What if I will not reach my entire goal?
I am a programmer. This means, that visual and voiced parts are screaming for your help. The project will be finished no matter what! But the funds must be raised somehow. Therefore I would really appreciate your help.
What about the team?
The team will be hired. I would be a producer, designer and programmer. The team will consist of a sound engineer, a composer and two artists (one for paper sketches, one would be a computer artist). To reduce the cost, everything will be set up before hiring any workers. This is to avoid a moment when employees have nothing to do.

Also, to any new fans of the Game: Welcome!<br/><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img594.imageshack.us/img594/7653/bioind.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""bionite box art""/>

<p>BIONITE: Origins is an upcoming, futuristic, first-person shooter &amp; real-time strategy hybrid for the PC, iOS and MAC platforms. The core gameplay consists of piloting hovertanks in first-person, destroying other tanks or structures, commanding your squad to attack/defend certain targets, and a full strategy mode with base-building in the Strategy game type.<br/><br/> We want to bring back the almost-forgotten FPS/RTS hybrid genre. With BIONITE: Origins being called the spiritual successor to the critically acclaimed, 1998 PC game: Battlezone, we have a lot to live up to. But, with the help and guidance of Designer/Lead Designer of Battlezone &amp; Battlezone II — William Stahl — the future looks promising.<br/><br/>Powered by the Unreal 3 Engine, BIONITE: Origins will be released digitally through Steam and other distribution sites.<br/><br/><img alt="""" border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img809.imageshack.us/img809/2751/6hovertank.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>We've been working hard towards delivering a fun &amp; unique gaming experience. Right now our current goal is finishing the Multiplayer game-modes first and then releasing the game on Steam &amp; other distribution sites. The current Multiplayer game-modes being developed are Siege, CTF, Team Deathmatch &amp; a full Real-Time Strategy game-mode (Strat) which you'll be able to control everything on the battlefield from the first-person view. Though, there will be a Satellite feature too.<br/><br/>Once we're finished developing the Multiplayer and while you guys are having fun online blowing each other up--we're going to be hard at work developing the Singleplayer missions.<br/><br/>The main resource in the Strat game-mode and the Singleplayer missions is Bionite--which is used to produce new units and construct new buildings. Building and directing units is done either by selecting an onscreen unit/building with the mouse or by using the number keys on your keyboard. You'll be able to build base defenses, command a force of hovertanks, and strategically take out the enemy. <br/><br/><img alt="""" border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img15.imageshack.us/img15/2683/8whybuildthisgame.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Because no one else will. We are making this game to continue to change the industry and show that dedicated fans, like ourselves, can make an impact in this industry too. We want to see a great game made by fans, for fans, succeed in today's massive gaming market, and prove that it can be done so that others can be inspired to create &amp; share games they love too.<br/><br/>We see BIONITE as an ""extended First-Person Shooter"", because right now we are in an era of one-way oriented shooters. By implementing Real-Time Strategy elements, learning from past mistakes and listening to our fans, eFPS becomes a fresh way to play First-Person video games. Besides, when was the last time you played a FPS/RTS hybrid sci-fi-hovertank-space-shooting game?<br/><br/><img alt="""" border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img338.imageshack.us/img338/9231/4storyf.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/></p>

<p>We constantly strive to deliver the best content on as many platforms as possible. Today, almost everyone uses a mobile device. Not to mention that every year phones become faster and more powerful. We see the value in mobile devices and believe that they play a part in future gaming. <br/><br/>That's why we are excited to announce that BIONITE: Origins will be arriving on mobile devices. Shortly after the desktop version is released, we will release an iOS version to run on both the iPad and iPhone. We envision the mobile game to have the same great core features as the desktop version and we can't wait to experience BIONITE: Origins with touch, tilt, and voice controls. We also hope to make the game playable cross-platform (i.e. desktop players can still battle iOS players).<br/><br/>We are in the process of creating a networking app for mobile devices as well. This will allow you to check your stats, see other players' rankings, challenge your enemies, and more. Look for it in the App Store soon.<br/><br/><img alt="""" border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img855.imageshack.us/img855/1449/7meettheteam.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Platoon Studios is a core group of 12 people that are passionate about video games. Everyone on the Team shares an enthusiasm for PC games and their creation. We have a complete team of artists and programmers dedicated to bringing back the FPS/RTS genre for the PC. Also, one additional requirement to joining our Team is (and always will be) a humble acknowledgment of the great work done to create the original hybrid: Battlezone '98.<br/><br/>Platoon Studios had the most humble of beginnings. After about two years of development and trial by fire, we finally had a working Alpha. Now we’re on our way to solid Beta Testing Phase.<br/><br/>The Founder, John Grisnik is just some crazy guy who spends all of his time yelling at his PC and not giving up.  His attitude towards getting things done is reflected. We have an outstanding crew, especially our SSgt. Dan Rhodenizer, who has been a critical team member since day one.</p>
<h2><strong>GAME FEATURES</strong></h2>
<p>The multiplayer version of Bionite: Origins will ship with all of the content available at the time of release and will include a dedicated server.

<p>We have released many alpha's during the development of Bionite: Origins and are currently working on Alpha Rev 10. This will be our last alpha that will be available to the general public. Once the beta is released, the testing will be closed and available only to our Backers or by invite. The planned release date for Alpha Rev 10 is November 12th, 2012 at 8:00PM PST USA.  All of our Backers will be able to download and play the Alpha.</p>
<p>The Alpha Rev 10 is a SinglePlayer Trainer located at the Emze Mine on Venus. It is a basic framework for the Siege Game that we are going to feature in the beta.  The Goal is to beat the Computer by destroying the objectives before the time expires.  In Siege, the Goal is for the offence to capture the main objective before the match time expires. If the offence fails to capture the main objective, the defence wins. </p>
<h2><strong>Sponsored Tournaments</strong></h2>
<p>Platoon Studios will hold two Sponsored On-Line Touranmants each year to determine the best Tank Pilot, the best Squad, and the best Overall Team.  These will all be held only on Ranked Servers with a Platoon Studios Moderator monitoring the each match as a Referree.  Prizes and awards will be presented to the winners and the Tournament Results will be posted on our main website.  The entry fee is included in the Subscription service, but the tournaments are open to the general public.</p>

<h3><strong>The Wingman Formation and Pattern User Interface</strong></h3>
<p><strong>This is a unique feature to Bionite: Origins.  </strong>The pilot will be able to control his/her wingmen/wingwomen in the game by using a unique HUD element called the ""Formation and Pattern Interface"". The wingmen are designed to 'Fly in Formation' or 'Attack in Patterns' based on the pilots commands. These formations and patterns can be set up prior to entering the match, then executed in game on the battle field by selecting the Formation or Pattern Number in the Interface Panel (located in the HUD).  We are currently in the R&amp;D phase of adding this feature to the App. In addition to preset 'plays' the Formation and Pattern interface has a 'custom' section.  This section of the UI allows the pilot to create thier own 'plays' for the wingmen to follow using the familiar 'X' and 'O' system used in football/soccer.</p>

<p>The $60,000 raised during our IndieGoGo Campaign will go strictly towards the development of BIONITE: Origins.  We are just about to reach the Beta Phase at the end of this year and we plan on having the final release done on March 1st, 2013.  In addition to development costs to finish the game, the money raised will go towords establishing a network of online servers, finishing the statistical tracking system, and providing the Team with a means to work full-time until this is finished. We are working on 3 maps for testing during the beta phase. We would also like to start on March 1st with the Statistical Tracking System up and running.

<p>We're not making this game for the sake of making a game, or to make money. We're Battlezone fans who have come from across the world just to make this happen. We've been working on this for over 2 years with basically a $0 budget -- a few of us working at it full-time, while others spare-time when they're not at their day jobs.  Were doing this purely from a standpoint of wanting to make a great game.  Everyone at Platoon Studios is a huge fans of BZ and we really want to make a game that could be considerd the spiritual successor.  Games like BZ are the essence of what video games are, and need to be included in the future of gaming.   </p>
<h3>
<br/>Not to mention, we just want another game where we can finally pilot hovertanks on different planets and moons again.</h3>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 120px;""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1086.photobucket.com/albums/j446/LtrFEED/Untitledff.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></h3></div>","This Listing is for the Multiplayer Version of the Game Only.
Thanks for taking a look at our IndieGoGo Campaign, we really appreciate the great support from our Supporters over the years, we could not have got this far without you. Also, to any new fans of the Game: Welcome!

BIONITE: Origins is an upcoming, futuristic, first-person shooter & real-time strategy hybrid for the PC, iOS and MAC platforms. The core gameplay consists of piloting hovertanks in first-person, destroying other tanks or structures, commanding your squad to attack/defend certain targets, and a full strategy mode with base-building in the Strategy game type. We want to bring back the almost-forgotten FPS/RTS hybrid genre. With BIONITE: Origins being called the spiritual successor to the critically acclaimed, 1998 PC game: Battlezone, we have a lot to live up to. But, with the help and guidance of Designer/Lead Designer of Battlezone & Battlezone II — William Stahl — the future looks promising.Powered by the Unreal 3 Engine, BIONITE: Origins will be released digitally through Steam and other distribution sites.We've been working hard towards delivering a fun & unique gaming experience. Right now our current goal is finishing the Multiplayer game-modes first and then releasing the game on Steam & other distribution sites. The current Multiplayer game-modes being developed are Siege, CTF, Team Deathmatch & a full Real-Time Strategy game-mode (Strat) which you'll be able to control everything on the battlefield from the first-person view. Though, there will be a Satellite feature too.Once we're finished developing the Multiplayer and while you guys are having fun online blowing each other up--we're going to be hard at work developing the Singleplayer missions.The main resource in the Strat game-mode and the Singleplayer missions is Bionite--which is used to produce new units and construct new buildings. Building and directing units is done either by selecting an onscreen unit/building with the mouse or by using the number keys on your keyboard. You'll be able to build base defenses, command a force of hovertanks, and strategically take out the enemy. 
Because no one else will. We are making this game to continue to change the industry and show that dedicated fans, like ourselves, can make an impact in this industry too. We want to see a great game made by fans, for fans, succeed in today's massive gaming market, and prove that it can be done so that others can be inspired to create & share games they love too.We see BIONITE as an ""extended First-Person Shooter"", because right now we are in an era of one-way oriented shooters. By implementing Real-Time Strategy elements, learning from past mistakes and listening to our fans, eFPS becomes a fresh way to play First-Person video games. Besides, when was the last time you played a FPS/RTS hybrid sci-fi-hovertank-space-shooting game?

We constantly strive to deliver the best content on as many platforms as possible. Today, almost everyone uses a mobile device. Not to mention that every year phones become faster and more powerful. We see the value in mobile devices and believe that they play a part in future gaming. That's why we are excited to announce that BIONITE: Origins will be arriving on mobile devices. Shortly after the desktop version is released, we will release an iOS version to run on both the iPad and iPhone. We envision the mobile game to have the same great core features as the desktop version and we can't wait to experience BIONITE: Origins with touch, tilt, and voice controls. We also hope to make the game playable cross-platform (i.e. desktop players can still battle iOS players).We are in the process of creating a networking app for mobile devices as well. This will allow you to check your stats, see other players' rankings, challenge your enemies, and more. Look for it in the App Store soon.
Platoon Studios is a core group of 12 people that are passionate about video games. Everyone on the Team shares an enthusiasm for PC games and their creation. We have a complete team of artists and programmers dedicated to bringing back the FPS/RTS genre for the PC. Also, one additional requirement to joining our Team is (and always will be) a humble acknowledgment of the great work done to create the original hybrid: Battlezone '98.Platoon Studios had the most humble of beginnings. After about two years of development and trial by fire, we finally had a working Alpha. Now we’re on our way to solid Beta Testing Phase.The Founder, John Grisnik is just some crazy guy who spends all of his time yelling at his PC and not giving up.  His attitude towards getting things done is reflected. We have an outstanding crew, especially our SSgt. Dan Rhodenizer, who has been a critical team member since day one.

Bionite: Origins Alpha Rev 10
We have released many alpha's during the development of Bionite: Origins and are currently working on Alpha Rev 10. This will be our last alpha that will be available to the general public. Once the beta is released, the testing will be closed and available only to our Backers or by invite. The planned release date for Alpha Rev 10 is November 12th, 2012 at 8:00PM PST USA.  All of our Backers will be able to download and play the Alpha.
The Alpha Rev 10 is a SinglePlayer Trainer located at the Emze Mine on Venus. It is a basic framework for the Siege Game that we are going to feature in the beta.  The Goal is to beat the Computer by destroying the objectives before the time expires.  In Siege, the Goal is for the offence to capture the main objective before the match time expires. If the offence fails to capture the main objective, the defence wins. 
Sponsored Tournaments
Platoon Studios will hold two Sponsored On-Line Touranmants each year to determine the best Tank Pilot, the best Squad, and the best Overall Team.  These will all be held only on Ranked Servers with a Platoon Studios Moderator monitoring the each match as a Referree.  Prizes and awards will be presented to the winners and the Tournament Results will be posted on our main website.  The entry fee is included in the Subscription service, but the tournaments are open to the general public.
Non Monetary Contributions
We greatly appreciate everyones contribution to the Game.  If you are unable to Back us during this Campaign, please tweet your firends about the Game and add a us to your FaceBook Page.

</center>
<p>Thanks for checking us out! Welcome to the IndieGoGo home of Divergence: Online; A hardcore sandbox mmorpg that brings back the glory years of truly massive online games where player freedom wasn't just a tag-line, it was the whole experience.</p>
<p>Divergence is a project I started in 2006 with the idea of bringing back what I considered to be ""real MMORPGs"" to the ailing genre, bloated with disposable throwaway installments. In the midst of a recession, the project has suffered from an almost total lack of reliable funding until now. It wasn't until noticing the success other projects were seeing with much less shown and available to backers that I decided it would be criminal not to charge full-steam at an IndieGogo crowdsourcing campaign.</p>
<center>
<p><a href=""http://youtu.be/pMC0Grq3X0E"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> <img alt=""CLICK HERE for Video 2!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.the-shade.com/images/doclickhere.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
</center>
<p>Divergence's Battle Strategy is simple:</p>
<h3>Maximum. Player. Freedom.</h3>
<p><strong>The way it aims to accomplish this is:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A virtually limitless-sized gaming world. The ocean is in itself, unending. There is no border and no edge. Continents are raised from the seafloor on demand providing an almost limitless supply of new territory just begging to be conquered by players.</li>
<li>A non-linear world spreading out in all directions. Pick a direction and GO. Streamed to your client, the player can cross dozens of kilometers without seeing a single load screen.</li>
<li>A Skill-Based progression system. No levels, just you and what you choose to do and get better at. Master a profession or round out your character with skills from several at once.</li>
<li>Advance in ways other than combat. Be a career architect, a tailor, a dancer, a bio engineer or any number of non-combative professions in pursuit of the almighty-credit.</li>
</ul><h3>The Pursuit of Gaming Truth</h3>
<p>Divergence does not placate the user. You won't be rewarded with thousands of meaningless achievements or exploitable special attacks. Our aim is to give the end-user REAL features, not just clever tricks of scenery, particles and way... way too much bloom. Divergence will never treat you like a child or lead you down a cleverly disguised pipe of an existence towards the same tired meaningless endgame.</p>
<h3>True Combat. True Physics.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Keeping with it's mission goal of truth in gaming, Divergence's core gameplay is based on a real-world model.</li>
<li>Under typical circumstances, there is no ""TAB targetting and attacking"". Where you point your weapon is where you fire ir, swing it, or focus your righteous indignation. You aren't ""faked out"" with a pretty particle system made to fool you into thinking you're actually firing, you ARE firing.</li>
<li>Projectiles have mass and momentum. You have mass. All objects have mass and almost all objects can be destructible. What does this mean? Use you imagination.</li>
<li>Real physics means real movement. There is no ""jump on a flying mount and move from place to place in 3D."" In Divergence (as you can already see in our Part 2 video) all movement, and subsequently flight, is REAL and at times hard to control. How's your piloting skill?</li>
</ul><h3>Divergence Means HARD-CORE</h3>
<ul>
<li>Open-PVP everywhere.<strong> No exceptions.</strong> If you don't like the way that alien is checking out your girl, put a bullet in his face. Just be prepapred to lose faction with the establishments bouncers who with enough ruckus may elect to toss your ass out.</li>
<li>Lootable Corpses. You won't have an inventory full of thousands of ridiculous objects. All objects have a mass equivalent and slow you down based on your physical ability to carry loads. Don't carry your valuables on you!</li>
<li>Limited Permanent-Death. The most controversial of the controversial. Cloning in Divergence is common but not guaranteed. You'll need clone insurance, a few clones in storage, to be within the sphere of a cloning beacon and a race which can actually clone in order to avoid starting over on your character after death.<strong> Death means something, and thus life means something. </strong>Dancers, don't despair. Most NPC and player towns have their own cloning spheres.</li>
</ul><h3>A Modifiable World</h3>
<p>Working in hand with our crafting system, there are a multitude of ways the player can affect the actual game world itself. Explosives blow holes in the terrain, sometimes exposing veigns of precious minerals beneath. Use a personal drill or drop a mining rig to drill down in your absense, or build up the terrain to a flat section perfect for putting that house on top of. If I were you, I wouldn't leave that equipment lying around too long though, privateers are all about. Better safe than sorry, put a turret near your rig! Bandits won't dare mess with your stuff if they could die and lose their own gear in the process. Unless of course, they have courage.</p>
<h3>Truly Unique Races</h3>
<p>In Divergence, the playable races and breeds aren't confined to being purely graphical changes from one to the next. Some races, such as humans, have several breeds, each with differences among them. Some races such as AI or D-Tanix have no body of their own and must dominate other entites, assuming their abilities, strengths and shortcoming. Still even more extreme are the Vindicator, who being members of a dying species cannot normally clone at all and when killed never return.</p>
<p><strong>Available Human Breeds</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Homo-Sapiens</strong> Constituting the majority of humans in the galaxy, Sapien Humans have the largest amount of customization available to them.</li>
<li>
<strong>Homo-Solitus</strong> The first breed of humans born to share the Earth with Sapiens since the demise of Homo-Neanderthalas. These humans were found to have a naturally developed spatial intelligence as well as numerous other neurological differences.</li>
<li>
<strong>Homo-Auxilium</strong> The first genetically created breed of humans, these sturdy individuals were bred to be the perfect soldiers until the arrival of Homo-Invitrus.</li>
<li>
<strong>Homo-Invitrus</strong> These humans were born entirely in a lab and grown as such until adulthood in essentially a testtube. They are smaller than Auxilium humans but have a fused ribcage and heightened regenerative capabilities with the traedoff of an extremely short lifespan.</li>
<li>
<strong>Homo-Callidus</strong> An illegally-engineered breed of humans, these grey-skinned and lithe humans posessed an almost entirely cartilagenous skeleton and reflex speeds many times that of traditional human breeds.</li>
</ul><h3>Funding Requirements and Milestones</h3>
<p>Here are a few items we're looking forward to demonstrating once we get to certain milestones. Obviously things could still be added to these and with any luck we'll be able to exceed these goals!</p>

This is an EXTREMELY rare upgrade and the only one which exists independant of all others thus it must be purchased seperately.

<p><img alt=""ethan@divergence-online.com"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.the-shade.com/images/ethanaddress.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""ethan@divergence-online.com""/></p></div>","Thanks for checking us out! Welcome to the IndieGoGo home of Divergence: Online; A hardcore sandbox mmorpg that brings back the glory years of truly massive online games where player freedom wasn't just a tag-line, it was the whole experience.
Divergence is a project I started in 2006 with the idea of bringing back what I considered to be ""real MMORPGs"" to the ailing genre, bloated with disposable throwaway installments. In the midst of a recession, the project has suffered from an almost total lack of reliable funding until now. It wasn't until noticing the success other projects were seeing with much less shown and available to backers that I decided it would be criminal not to charge full-steam at an IndieGogo crowdsourcing campaign.

 

Divergence's Battle Strategy is simple:
Maximum. Player. Freedom.
The way it aims to accomplish this is:

A virtually limitless-sized gaming world. The ocean is in itself, unending. There is no border and no edge. Continents are raised from the seafloor on demand providing an almost limitless supply of new territory just begging to be conquered by players.
A non-linear world spreading out in all directions. Pick a direction and GO. Streamed to your client, the player can cross dozens of kilometers without seeing a single load screen.
A Skill-Based progression system. No levels, just you and what you choose to do and get better at. Master a profession or round out your character with skills from several at once.
Advance in ways other than combat. Be a career architect, a tailor, a dancer, a bio engineer or any number of non-combative professions in pursuit of the almighty-credit.
The Pursuit of Gaming Truth
Divergence does not placate the user. You won't be rewarded with thousands of meaningless achievements or exploitable special attacks. Our aim is to give the end-user REAL features, not just clever tricks of scenery, particles and way... way too much bloom. Divergence will never treat you like a child or lead you down a cleverly disguised pipe of an existence towards the same tired meaningless endgame.
True Combat. True Physics.

Keeping with it's mission goal of truth in gaming, Divergence's core gameplay is based on a real-world model.
Under typical circumstances, there is no ""TAB targetting and attacking"". Where you point your weapon is where you fire ir, swing it, or focus your righteous indignation. You aren't ""faked out"" with a pretty particle system made to fool you into thinking you're actually firing, you ARE firing.
Projectiles have mass and momentum. You have mass. All objects have mass and almost all objects can be destructible. What does this mean? Use you imagination.
Real physics means real movement. There is no ""jump on a flying mount and move from place to place in 3D."" In Divergence (as you can already see in our Part 2 video) all movement, and subsequently flight, is REAL and at times hard to control. How's your piloting skill?
Divergence Means HARD-CORE

Open-PVP everywhere. No exceptions. If you don't like the way that alien is checking out your girl, put a bullet in his face. Just be prepapred to lose faction with the establishments bouncers who with enough ruckus may elect to toss your ass out.
Lootable Corpses. You won't have an inventory full of thousands of ridiculous objects. All objects have a mass equivalent and slow you down based on your physical ability to carry loads. Don't carry your valuables on you!
Limited Permanent-Death. The most controversial of the controversial. Cloning in Divergence is common but not guaranteed. You'll need clone insurance, a few clones in storage, to be within the sphere of a cloning beacon and a race which can actually clone in order to avoid starting over on your character after death. Death means something, and thus life means something. Dancers, don't despair. Most NPC and player towns have their own cloning spheres.
A Modifiable World
Working in hand with our crafting system, there are a multitude of ways the player can affect the actual game world itself. Explosives blow holes in the terrain, sometimes exposing veigns of precious minerals beneath. Use a personal drill or drop a mining rig to drill down in your absense, or build up the terrain to a flat section perfect for putting that house on top of. If I were you, I wouldn't leave that equipment lying around too long though, privateers are all about. Better safe than sorry, put a turret near your rig! Bandits won't dare mess with your stuff if they could die and lose their own gear in the process. Unless of course, they have courage.
Truly Unique Races
In Divergence, the playable races and breeds aren't confined to being purely graphical changes from one to the next. Some races, such as humans, have several breeds, each with differences among them. Some races such as AI or D-Tanix have no body of their own and must dominate other entites, assuming their abilities, strengths and shortcoming. Still even more extreme are the Vindicator, who being members of a dying species cannot normally clone at all and when killed never return.
Available Human Breeds


Homo-Sapiens Constituting the majority of humans in the galaxy, Sapien Humans have the largest amount of customization available to them.

Homo-Solitus The first breed of humans born to share the Earth with Sapiens since the demise of Homo-Neanderthalas. These humans were found to have a naturally developed spatial intelligence as well as numerous other neurological differences.

Homo-Auxilium The first genetically created breed of humans, these sturdy individuals were bred to be the perfect soldiers until the arrival of Homo-Invitrus.

Homo-Invitrus These humans were born entirely in a lab and grown as such until adulthood in essentially a testtube. They are smaller than Auxilium humans but have a fused ribcage and heightened regenerative capabilities with the traedoff of an extremely short lifespan.

Homo-Callidus An illegally-engineered breed of humans, these grey-skinned and lithe humans posessed an almost entirely cartilagenous skeleton and reflex speeds many times that of traditional human breeds.
Funding Requirements and Milestones
Here are a few items we're looking forward to demonstrating once we get to certain milestones. Obviously things could still be added to these and with any luck we'll be able to exceed these goals!

Milestone $10,000New Video and Documentary: The races and the factions. First Player Island Video (Purchased by Souli Hamos)

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Ben, and I am the project co-ordinator and team leader at NOVASOFTstudios.  We are a team of 18 people and are currently making a Christmas themed app to break our name into the industry.  At the moment we are working on getting a technical alpha build for our main title, and developing a couple of mobile games on the side to get our name out there and to introduce funding for the apps and the larger project.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>At the moment we have a couple of apps lined up in states of completion that only need funding to get out there!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>What is SnowMaze?</h3>
<p>SnowMaze is an iOS app game set in a snowglobe.  The player is tasked to guide his/her marble around the completely randomly generated maze in search of presents, all the while looking out for holes, enemies and making sure the snow in the globe doesn't get too thick!  (If the snow settles, you won't see the presents!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>There will be two game modes:  Challenge Mode, where you race to complete as many small mazes as possible as quick as possible before you eventually get caught by an enemy, and Exploration Mode, where you are put in a huge maze with multiple presents where you have to find as many as possible and make it to the exit alive.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We're also implementing an editing feature, where you can make your own snowglobe in a scene that will also showcase 'trophies' gained from getting ingame achievements!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We're looking to use this app to break our name into the business - while our team is comprised of several industry professionals as a name we are currently not well known.  If we don't get the funding we need for this project, then the apps will be severely set back, or we will have to fund it from our own budget, which is currently needed on our big title.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This would greatly delay our releases this year and next.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The funding for this project will go towards buying the iOS development licence for the Unity3D Game Development Tool and Game Engine as well as purchasing enrolment in Apple's iOS developer program, granting us access to the Software Development Kit, which will enable us to release our apps on the app store.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If we don't get sufficient funding then we'll either have to delay the app release or pay for it ourselves, but it's money that we really don't have at the moment.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The money will cover us for releasing apps over the next year (apple's enrolment in the developer program is $99 a year) but the licence for Unity3D ($400) is permanent.  The remaining $100 will go towards outsourcing assets for the apps as well as marketing and publicising them.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We'll keep this campaign updated with videos documenting new builds as we add new features right up until release!  Our first video is due on Wednesday 7th December (delayed due to technical difficulty).</p>

<h2 align=""center"">What's an Adventure Mobile App?</h2>
</div>
<p>The Adventure mobile app will allow you to get outside and get out of your daily routine without the hassle of planning or expense of a personal guide! By responding in real-time to clandestine prompts such as “land or sea” and “sweat it out or break it up” on your mobile device you will unlock Adventure Challenges with detailed instructions and turn-by-turn navigation to follow in real-life!</p>
<h2 align=""center""><img alt=""Choose Your Own Adventure Mobile App"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/862734/pictures/full/20130610165027-P5260219.JPG?1370908236"" src="""" style="""" title=""Choose Your Own Adventure Mobile App""/></h2>
<p> </p>
<h2>      How does the Adventure Mobile App Work?</h2>
<p>Each Adventure will start from a designated location and boast up to 16 potential outcomes depending on your real-time Adventure choices throughout the day.  While you may learn to surf, take a hike and enjoy a picnic, another app user starting from the exact same location may choose to go for a bike ride, dine on local cuisine and fly a kite on a secluded beach.</p>
<p> <img alt=""Where wil your decisions lead you?"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/860749/pictures/full/20130609174938-Untitled.png?1370825383"" src="""" style="""" title=""Where wil your decisions lead you?""/></p>
<p>Prior to purchasing an Adventure through the mobile app, you will see an estimated timeframe, budget, fitness ranking and eco-score as well as clothing suggestions and gear requirements.  You will be able to purchase the Adventure ($25-50 retail) in advance of your trip (though access to the Adventure itself won’t be available until you activate the starting trigger) or immediately before embarking on the first leg of the journey. </p>
<p><img alt=""Maybe you'll do this...?!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/860761/pictures/full/20130610104442-IMG_0692.JPG?1370886289"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""Maybe you'll do this...?!""/>In addition, multiple  Adventure sequences will be offered in each location to maximize the customization of your experience.  For example, there may be an <em>Explore</em> Adventure sequence, <em>Physical Challenge</em> Adventure sequence and <em>Mental Escape</em> Adventure sequence all available in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Explorers may visit national, state or regional parks, take in views and focus on learning about an area and all it has to offer. Conversely, Physical Challengers will be constantly moving- hiking to the tops of mountains, taking surf lessons (or heading out on their own) and being challenged to dig deeper and push harder all day long.  Mental Escapes will focus on discovering the serenity of a location, appreciating the smell of the woods and the sound of the stream, while taking the time to relax and let go.</p>
<h2 style=""margin-left: 60px;""><strong>                          Where and When <br/></strong></h2>
<p>Adventures will be offered in a growing number of locations throughout California (and beyond as we continue to expand!) for <strong>both iPhone and Android platforms, <em>provided we reach our funding goal</em>.</strong>  But you won’t have to wait for every Adventure location to be developed before you can experience an Adventure.  We will make each location available to app users as soon as it is ready!</p>
<p>Although initial Adventures will be in California, once this technology is developed, we will be able to Adventures in any location.  And as part of the ""Perks,"" YOU get to vote on additional locations to be developed!</p>

<h2>Our Unique Model</h2>
<p>The<strong> prototype</strong> for the Adventure app is a paper hard-copy Adventure packet that is 100% customized for each client (based on early client input).  Adventure Challenges, directions and activities are only revealed when clients open sealed instructions at checkpoints throughout the day.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><img alt=""Custom Adventure Packet"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/860758/pictures/full/20130609175302-IMG_1028.JPG?1370825586"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Custom Adventure Packet""/></p>
<p>We currently require two weeks advanced booking for hard-copy <a href=""http://www.ethosadventures.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Custom Adventures</a> ($125-$275 retail) due to the time required for 100% customization, planning, packaging and shipping.  However, by leveraging mobile technology, we’re taking Custom Adventures to the next level so that you can decide on a whim to have an Adventure, supplement a pre-planned trip, or spontaneously impress a date!</p>
<p><img alt=""Maybe you'll see this...?!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/860833/pictures/full/20130609185538-IMG_1328.JPG?1370829343"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""Maybe you'll see this...?!""/></p>
<p>Given the overwhelming positive support for Custom Adventures, we will always offer them, especially for backcountry locations, groups, special needs and longer trips.  Check out what’s been said about our Custom Adventures <a href=""http://www.ethosadventures.com/testimonials.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, we are committed to <strong>environmental conservation</strong> and strive to design green Adventures, awarding each trip an eco-rating. </p>
<p>Our goal is to get people outside and out of their daily routine with minimal environmental impacts.</p>
<h2 style=""margin-left: 150px;""> </h2>
<h2 style=""margin-left: 150px;"">         Why $24,978?</h2>
<p>We are committed to building a mobile app that adds to, rather than monopolizes or detracts from, the Adventure experience, so we will be partnering with a developer whose expertise in custom mobile technology meets our expertise and high standards in adventuring.  Thus, the app itself is projected to cost at least $20,000.  Once we include costs for initial location scouting and Indiegogo and credit card fees, we arrive at $24,978.</p>
<p><strong>Stretch Goal $38,818: </strong>With $38,818 we’ll include even more awesome application user-interface features.  For example, in addition to earning Eco-points you will also be able to unlock Effort badges when you complete Adventure Challenges, which will be tracked via the Eco and Effort leader boards.  Your Eco and Effort scores will qualify you for Adventure discounts and free Adventures.  You will be given the opportunity to share your scores or challenge friends.  And based on your Adventuring scores and history, EA may recommend specific Adventures for you. </p>
<h2 style=""margin-left: 210px;"">Perk Addition!</h2>
<p>To get this sweet T-shirt you must either:</p>
<p>(1) Contribute $20 over any Perk level (excluding the $6 level) by either making two seperate contributions (and not selecting a perk in one of them) or by making one contribution that includes one Perk outlined in the right-side panel plus at least $20 (for example you could contribute $46 and receive both the $26 Perk and this T-shirt) </p>

<p>Yes!  We were so successful at spreading the word that the owner of the name phrase found us!  As Chooseco LLC has no involvement in this project, we've changed the title of the campaign.  Good catch on noticing!  As a result of the change none of the Perks appear to be claimed (and our tweeter roll went down to zero), don't worry though we have captured all claimed Perks-- no contributions have gone missing!</p>

<p>Shoot us an email at <a href=""mailto:info@ethosadventures.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">info@ethosadventures.com</a>!</p></div>","What's an Adventure Mobile App?

The Adventure mobile app will allow you to get outside and get out of your daily routine without the hassle of planning or expense of a personal guide! By responding in real-time to clandestine prompts such as “land or sea” and “sweat it out or break it up” on your mobile device you will unlock Adventure Challenges with detailed instructions and turn-by-turn navigation to follow in real-life!

 
      How does the Adventure Mobile App Work?
Each Adventure will start from a designated location and boast up to 16 potential outcomes depending on your real-time Adventure choices throughout the day.  While you may learn to surf, take a hike and enjoy a picnic, another app user starting from the exact same location may choose to go for a bike ride, dine on local cuisine and fly a kite on a secluded beach.
 
Prior to purchasing an Adventure through the mobile app, you will see an estimated timeframe, budget, fitness ranking and eco-score as well as clothing suggestions and gear requirements.  You will be able to purchase the Adventure ($25-50 retail) in advance of your trip (though access to the Adventure itself won’t be available until you activate the starting trigger) or immediately before embarking on the first leg of the journey. 
In addition, multiple  Adventure sequences will be offered in each location to maximize the customization of your experience.  For example, there may be an Explore Adventure sequence, Physical Challenge Adventure sequence and Mental Escape Adventure sequence all available in San Francisco.
Explorers may visit national, state or regional parks, take in views and focus on learning about an area and all it has to offer. Conversely, Physical Challengers will be constantly moving- hiking to the tops of mountains, taking surf lessons (or heading out on their own) and being challenged to dig deeper and push harder all day long.  Mental Escapes will focus on discovering the serenity of a location, appreciating the smell of the woods and the sound of the stream, while taking the time to relax and let go.
                          Where and When 
Adventures will be offered in a growing number of locations throughout California (and beyond as we continue to expand!) for both iPhone and Android platforms, provided we reach our funding goal.  But you won’t have to wait for every Adventure location to be developed before you can experience an Adventure.  We will make each location available to app users as soon as it is ready!
Although initial Adventures will be in California, once this technology is developed, we will be able to Adventures in any location.  And as part of the ""Perks,"" YOU get to vote on additional locations to be developed!

 
 
Project Timeline
June/July: Indiegogo Campaign
August-November: App development and location scouting
December: Integration runs/testing and app store submission
Early 2014: Adventure mobile app released!
 
 
 
Our Unique Model
The prototype for the Adventure app is a paper hard-copy Adventure packet that is 100% customized for each client (based on early client input).  Adventure Challenges, directions and activities are only revealed when clients open sealed instructions at checkpoints throughout the day.

We currently require two weeks advanced booking for hard-copy Custom Adventures ($125-$275 retail) due to the time required for 100% customization, planning, packaging and shipping.  However, by leveraging mobile technology, we’re taking Custom Adventures to the next level so that you can decide on a whim to have an Adventure, supplement a pre-planned trip, or spontaneously impress a date!

Given the overwhelming positive support for Custom Adventures, we will always offer them, especially for backcountry locations, groups, special needs and longer trips.  Check out what’s been said about our Custom Adventures here.
In addition, we are committed to environmental conservation and strive to design green Adventures, awarding each trip an eco-rating. 
Our goal is to get people outside and out of their daily routine with minimal environmental impacts.
 
         Why $24,978?
We are committed to building a mobile app that adds to, rather than monopolizes or detracts from, the Adventure experience, so we will be partnering with a developer whose expertise in custom mobile technology meets our expertise and high standards in adventuring.  Thus, the app itself is projected to cost at least $20,000.  Once we include costs for initial location scouting and Indiegogo and credit card fees, we arrive at $24,978.
Stretch Goal $38,818: With $38,818 we’ll include even more awesome application user-interface features.  For example, in addition to earning Eco-points you will also be able to unlock Effort badges when you complete Adventure Challenges, which will be tracked via the Eco and Effort leader boards.  Your Eco and Effort scores will qualify you for Adventure discounts and free Adventures.  You will be given the opportunity to share your scores or challenge friends.  And based on your Adventuring scores and history, EA may recommend specific Adventures for you. 
Perk Addition!
To get this sweet T-shirt you must either:
(1) Contribute $20 over any Perk level (excluding the $6 level) by either making two seperate contributions (and not selecting a perk in one of them) or by making one contribution that includes one Perk outlined in the right-side panel plus at least $20 (for example you could contribute $46 and receive both the $26 Perk and this T-shirt) 
OR
(2)""Refer"" someone else (using the share links below the video) who contributes at the $26 level or above

About Us
This project is a new development by Ethos Adventures, an outdoor adventure start-up launched by Laura Baker.

Prior to starting Ethos Adventures, Laura practiced as an environmental attorney focused on air quality, transportation and environmental justice issues.  She grew up exploring the Sierra Nevada Mountains near Yosemite National Park and has lived all over the country; Vermont to Hawaii. 
Laura has been planning outdoor trips since she was 17 years old.  She is an experienced orienteer and Adventure Racer, backpacker, snow-shoer, swimmer, kayaker, bicyclist, surfer and skier.  She is a lifelong trail and road-runner (Boston Marathon Qualifier) and certified running coach.  She also has certifications in scuba diving and First Aid/CPR.  Perhaps most importantly, Laura has been chased by bears, sharks, albatrosses, coyotes, a moose, chihuahuas, kittens and ducklings- and lived through it all! 

 
“I started Ethos Adventures because in today’s sedentary world of constant demands and hyper-connectivity it’s important to push the ‘reset’ button now and again.  We all need to rest and recharge, and getting outside and trying something new or experiencing something unexpected is the best way to do it!”

any questions give us an email at woodesh@gmail.com
check out our updates at the bottom of the Page!

The action takes place in a galaxy far away, where a humble farmer tends to his flock of farm animals hoping he'll be done in time for Supper. Little did he know that this would be the battleground for the most awesomely ultimate battle had ever witnessed, to deterimine which Robosaurus Rex will come out on top and be crowned King of the Cosmos.

 
 Many party orientated iOS titles can be confusing and often lack the depth and replay value. Approachability is something that we strive for in Robosaurus Rex. Simply tap your Rex and he will gobble up whatever unlucky thing that lies in his path. maybe your a button masher or a pick your moment assasin, the game is what you make it.

Eating the creatures, or ""bumps"" as we like to call them, earns the player a battery pack. In a single round, players will be eating dozens maybe even hundreds of bumps in an effort to score the most points. Once the round is over the player who ate the most wins. All the eaten bumps are converted into battery packs, which you can use to purchase permanent upgrades for later. This way the players are experiencing new power ups, environment disasters and different character bumps at their own pace.

 While Robosaurus Rex embodies our vision of stuff getting eaten by 90ft monsters, it's still missing the final touches. We believe that in order to create a universally loved gaming experience you take everyone on board.  
Our perks reflect this by giving donors a say in our game. Want to name a monkey Bruce? Done. Want Bruce to be a billionaire philanthropist by day and masquerade in a cape and tights by night? You got it! And if you donate enough, you can add your own monsters from the deepst darkest depths of your imagination, battle on planets never before seen by the human eye, even star in the game as yourself!


Robosaurus Rex's heartfelt thanks go out to you! Robosaurus Rex will use his intergrated Twitter microchip to Tweet a personal note to you. (Please include your twitter handle.every donor will also get a special mention in the credits.


Money, lots and lots of money to buy stuff with in the game. Upgrade those power-ups from the get go!

You get a digital copy of the Soundtrack composed by Francesco D'andrea.  Oh, and you get some batteries AND the adorable Triceratops!

Ooooh boy! you get to adopt a bump , your bump is a one of a kind character which will get its very own unique back story written in your own words!you will also get a special thanks in the credits under the title 'Adopter of (your character)'.  Available Bumps:

https://poxnixles.itch.io/incomspe [SUMMARY]Incompatible Species is a story detailing the daily adventures of a specialized (read: self-important) pest control unit. Despite the mismatched nature of each member and the world around them, what keeps them all together runs deeper than the surface.Human life has experienced a prosperous boom worldwide. Living conditions are above the minimum on a much broader scale, previously unsolved cures appear one by one, and surgical repair is as simple as spraying yourself with a specialized powder.But, of course, there's always room for even the tiniest improvement. Especially when these critters that can mutate themselves at will are popping up in unexpected cracks. When that happens, someone has to do the grunt work. Spotting an opportunistic foothold, Lucius Godwin forms the Exterminators and gets to it with his… companions? [FEATURES]
Stylish, expressive character art within a variety of locations
Richly detailed ""cutscene graphics"" (CG) to capture the most important moments
Voice acting for all the major characters
Extra side stories about the crew and those around them in their downtime
Diverse cast mainly focused on LGBTQ characters
 [ABOUT]Incompatible Species is a kinetic novel undergoing development in Ren'Py, slated to have full and expressive character sprites, background art from lush bio-technological cityscapes to dingy offices, voice acting, and some fun short episodes on the side.As far as an age rating, Incompatible Species is expected to be around the range of 13+ or 16+.Featured is emotional kickball writing, paired with gorgeous artwork and energetic music. [CAST] [Lucius Godwin][Character Voice: DJ Horn][Believes that working hard in the niche he has carved out will earn him the praise he thinks he deserves.

<p><u>Cash’s
Story</u></p>
<p>On
December 12<sup>th</sup>,
2013 Cash was admitted to hospital in Fort McMurray with
Croup. 

</p><p><span>The
following morning, Cash abruptly stopped breathing for several minutes and
needed to be intubated. Once Cash was stable he was transported to the PICU at the
Stollery Children’s Hospital in Edmonton.  When he arrived at
the Stollery he was placed in the PICU. Over the next 2-3
days Cash underwent a number of tests including EEG’s and an MRI. The
tests were reviewed by  doctors and, on December 15, we were informed that
Cash’s brain injury was devastating and their recommendation was to
let him go. </span></p>
<p>After
reviewing his file, a new doctor recommended we re-do all of the tests again.
Cash received a second MRI and there was “significant improvement”. On December
23, Cash was transferred to the Alberta Children’s Hospital in Calgary so we
could be closer to our families.</p>
<p>January
was a difficult month and Cash experienced severe bouts of irritability,
autonomic storming and dystonia. He is the youngest person to receive a
baclofen pump at ACH. Since receiving the pump things have improved greatly. Along with Cash’s baclocfen,
he is currently on a number of other medications. </p>
<p>Cash’s
injuries are still very severe but he is medically stable and we are  preparing for Cash to come home before his 2<sup>nd</sup> birthday.</p>
<p>Today
we couldn’t be more hopeful, excited for our future or inspired by what our
little guy is capable of overcoming.</p>

2013 Cash was admitted to hospital in Fort McMurray with
Croup. 

The
following morning, Cash abruptly stopped breathing for several minutes and
needed to be intubated. Once Cash was stable he was transported to the PICU at the
Stollery Children’s Hospital in Edmonton.  When he arrived at
the Stollery he was placed in the PICU. Over the next 2-3
days Cash underwent a number of tests including EEG’s and an MRI. The
tests were reviewed by  doctors and, on December 15, we were informed that
Cash’s brain injury was devastating and their recommendation was to
let him go. 
After
reviewing his file, a new doctor recommended we re-do all of the tests again.
Cash received a second MRI and there was “significant improvement”. On December
23, Cash was transferred to the Alberta Children’s Hospital in Calgary so we
could be closer to our families.
January
was a difficult month and Cash experienced severe bouts of irritability,
autonomic storming and dystonia. He is the youngest person to receive a
baclofen pump at ACH. Since receiving the pump things have improved greatly. Along with Cash’s baclocfen,
he is currently on a number of other medications. 
Cash’s
injuries are still very severe but he is medically stable and we are  preparing for Cash to come home before his 2nd birthday.
Today
we couldn’t be more hopeful, excited for our future or inspired by what our
little guy is capable of overcoming.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi folks, my name is Daniele Fornaciari, I’m from Italy where I work as senior software developer. I’m an Italian boy with an American Dream, and I have to thank Internet if I’m here today to realize my dream and you belong it. Internet today can offer many tools to overcome the rocks on the road. When you have to develop a product, a software product such as a physical product you need three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Money</li>
<li>Time</li>
<li>Work</li>
</ol>
<p>The first depends on the others and today thanks to many platforms is possible to find freelancers that can help you to develop your idea, and thanks to Indiegogo.com is possible to reach general public and find out people that believes in your project helping to realize the dream.</p>
<h1><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/77841/files/20130916131426-Project.png?1379362466"" src="""" style=""""/></h1>
<p>This is really an exciting project, give the life to a new character in something that is incredible stimulating, it stimulate the fantasy to find out what other will love. But in this case the first “other person” is my son.</p>
<p>But this project is real more exciting because is the first time that a character born before on Internet and Mobile and only then move on TV and Cinema, this is the reverse path of a regular character life. Sit down and listen me, now I’m going to tell you the story about the genesis of this project.</p> <p>I have a wonderful 2 years old baby. This summer his aunt presents him a board game. It was a quiz game about a very famous character, I don’t know if I can say her name but I’m sure you know her, she is pink like a pig. Anyway this is not the point. The board game was very funny and my son loves to play with it. It composed of some card of 3 different kind in each card some picture and a question, when the kid put a special pen, in bundle with the game, on a picture it make a sound for right answer.</p>
<p>This have brought me to decide to build up a mobile game inspired to it for my son. Sure, I cannot  use same pictures and images so I looked for a designer that helped me to develop this little project. Sure, that project was really simple to develop and to realize, but after some days and a very long brain storming with designer the beginning idea start to develop and change and become too much. So from a simple mobile game the project become so huge that I cannot to handle with my money, so I’m here. I decided to follow the principal of <i>“divide et impera”</i> so I divided the project into phases, to be able to handle it more easily. Going on I will describe the project in each phase for a preview of the whole  project, but I will give you more detail only for the current and for this campaign the objective is phase 0.</p>

<p>This is the beginning, during this phase we will produce three stuffs:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<b>Game</b>: Mulele’s kid game</li>
<li>
<b>Game</b>: Colouring together Mulele</li>
<li>
<b>Video</b>: a teaser video</li>
</ol>
<p>All the games are cross platform and will be delivered on IOS and Android using a famous open source OpenGL platform: <b>Cocos2d-x</b> (if you need, you can find out more information at: <a href=""http://www.cocos2d-x.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.cocos2d-x.org</a>).</p>
<h2>Mulele’s kid game.</h2>
<p>It’s a funny quiz game inspired to a board
game presented to my son. The idea behind this game is very simple. The kid
will be have in front 3 different type of questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<b>Question Type 1</b>: The aim of this one is to teach to kid to recognize objects, it’s compounded by:
<ol>
<li>1 big picture figuring an ordinary scene of Mulele’s life located in kitchen, at the playground, at school and other places</li>
<li>6 others little pictures of object that can be presents or not in the previous</li>
<li>a question of kind: “Which of the six pictures are present in the scene?”</li>
</ol>
Only 2 or 3 answers are right.</li>
<li>
<b>Question Type 2</b>: This have to teach to associate ordinary objects with the idea of activity or job, it’s compounded by:
<ol>
<li>1 big picture with Mulele different dressed like a basketball player or a pirates and so on.</li>
<li>6 others little picture </li>
<li>a question of kind: “Which objects Mulele uses when play basketball?”</li>
</ol>
Only 2 or 3 answers are right.</li>
<li>
<b>Question Type 3</b>: The aim of this last is to teach colours. In this one we will have:
<ol>
<li>1 big picture of Mulele different dressed </li>
<li>more questions of kind, “Which is the colour of hat?” or “Which is the colour of shirts?”</li>
<li>for each question 2 only answers</li>
</ol>
Only one answer is right</li>
</ol>
<p>Kid will select the right answer touching
it, if the selected one is right a nice sound a funny popup will signal the
correct behaviour, other hand only a losing sound will invite kid to retry.</p>
<h2>Colouring together Mulele</h2>
<p>This one is the classic colouring game
where kid will choose a simple picture of Mulele I don’t think to explain
other, but a new feature is really interesting: the parent will can publish the work of art on facebook if he wants.</p>
<h2>Video.</h2>
<p>This stuff will be publish on youtube and will be a video teaser with the aim to know this really funny character to the general public. The plot is already wrote but I prefer to unveil, the single user that are curious can write me and I will reveal it.</p>
<h2>What I need to produce this phase.</h2>

Mulele is becoming more real... now he say hallo top your son!!! Show it to your sons and share with us their reations ;)




Game startup:


Hi folks, my name is Daniele Fornaciari, I’m from Italy where I work as senior software developer. I’m an Italian boy with an American Dream, and I have to thank Internet if I’m here today to realize my dream and you belong it. Internet today can offer many tools to overcome the rocks on the road. When you have to develop a product, a software product such as a physical product you need three things:

Money
Time
Work

The first depends on the others and today thanks to many platforms is possible to find freelancers that can help you to develop your idea, and thanks to Indiegogo.com is possible to reach general public and find out people that believes in your project helping to realize the dream.

This is really an exciting project, give the life to a new character in something that is incredible stimulating, it stimulate the fantasy to find out what other will love. But in this case the first “other person” is my son.
But this project is real more exciting because is the first time that a character born before on Internet and Mobile and only then move on TV and Cinema, this is the reverse path of a regular character life. Sit down and listen me, now I’m going to tell you the story about the genesis of this project. I have a wonderful 2 years old baby. This summer his aunt presents him a board game. It was a quiz game about a very famous character, I don’t know if I can say her name but I’m sure you know her, she is pink like a pig. Anyway this is not the point. The board game was very funny and my son loves to play with it. It composed of some card of 3 different kind in each card some picture and a question, when the kid put a special pen, in bundle with the game, on a picture it make a sound for right answer.
This have brought me to decide to build up a mobile game inspired to it for my son. Sure, I cannot  use same pictures and images so I looked for a designer that helped me to develop this little project. Sure, that project was really simple to develop and to realize, but after some days and a very long brain storming with designer the beginning idea start to develop and change and become too much. So from a simple mobile game the project become so huge that I cannot to handle with my money, so I’m here. I decided to follow the principal of “divide et impera” so I divided the project into phases, to be able to handle it more easily. Going on I will describe the project in each phase for a preview of the whole  project, but I will give you more detail only for the current and for this campaign the objective is phase 0.
Have a question about the the project? Discuss with us about it on Mulele - Phase 0 at Crowdfundingforum.com!

I want to present you the character crew:





This is Mulele, he is a funny cute and amazing monster that lives with his family and he likes to play with our sons. What? Where come from that name? Sure, I will tell you. My son’s name is Samuele and another kid that lives in my  same building call him Mulele, it’s very simple and I like it very much. As all monster he likes scream,  play with toys, jump, flutter and as on.



This
is the Mulele’s sister, her name is Spring because like this seasons she loves animal, nature, walking up and down in the country and nose daisies.



Leo is the best friend of Mulele these two
pestiferous kid together can destroy your city by your laughter.



Babba, is the Mulele father (this is the name that my son use to call me) he is often out the house due work but he loves his son and in the week end he likes to play together Mulele.



And
at the end Mummy, she look at Mulele all the day, but sometimes happens the
Mulele escape from her look and then it is another story.


Then sure this is the real story of a real son that is a real little monster.

This is the beginning, during this phase we will produce three stuffs:



Game: Mulele’s kid game

Game: Colouring together Mulele

Video: a teaser video

All the games are cross platform and will be delivered on IOS and Android using a famous open source OpenGL platform: Cocos2d-x (if you need, you can find out more information at: www.cocos2d-x.org).
Mulele’s kid game.
It’s a funny quiz game inspired to a board
game presented to my son. The idea behind this game is very simple. The kid
will be have in front 3 different type of questions:


Question Type 1: The aim of this one is to teach to kid to recognize objects, it’s compounded by:

1 big picture figuring an ordinary scene of Mulele’s life located in kitchen, at the playground, at school and other places
6 others little pictures of object that can be presents or not in the previous
a question of kind: “Which of the six pictures are present in the scene?”

Only 2 or 3 answers are right.

Question Type 2: This have to teach to associate ordinary objects with the idea of activity or job, it’s compounded by:

1 big picture with Mulele different dressed like a basketball player or a pirates and so on.
6 others little picture 
a question of kind: “Which objects Mulele uses when play basketball?”

Only 2 or 3 answers are right.

Question Type 3: The aim of this last is to teach colours. In this one we will have:

1 big picture of Mulele different dressed 
more questions of kind, “Which is the colour of hat?” or “Which is the colour of shirts?”
for each question 2 only answers

Only one answer is right

Kid will select the right answer touching
it, if the selected one is right a nice sound a funny popup will signal the
correct behaviour, other hand only a losing sound will invite kid to retry.
Colouring together Mulele
This one is the classic colouring game
where kid will choose a simple picture of Mulele I don’t think to explain
other, but a new feature is really interesting: the parent will can publish the work of art on facebook if he wants.
Video.
This stuff will be publish on youtube and will be a video teaser with the aim to know this really funny character to the general public. The plot is already wrote but I prefer to unveil, the single user that are curious can write me and I will reveal it.

such success this phase can be start. Below the path:

Two more games
Publish sound track of 6 games on youtube
Convert game sound track into a compilation to sell.

</div></div>","These days, we all suffer from too many heavy accessories for our devices - chargers, adapters, hubs, and docks. The same is true for Nintendo Switch. The official Switch Dock is expensive and cumbersome and will only work with a separate charger. Packing all that gear really takes the fun out of a gaming meetup with friends. As game lovers, we wondered if a Switch dock could be more portable and simple? 
 The answer is definitely yes!We created Dongii, a pocket-sized dock, with Bluetooth 5.0 and a detachable 65W GaN charger, allowing you to connect your Nintendo Switch to most any television and wirelessly connect to Bluetooth headphones or speakers for a more immersive gaming experience.  
 Dongii can also quickly charge other devices thanks to its USB-C PD support. Smaller than the original docking station and with more functions than a charger, Dongii is the ultimate portable dock for the Nintendo Switch that provides the simplest way to connect to a TV and fast-charge any device.

 Make Any Television Your PlaygroundDongii is a small dock you can carry with you anywhere, easily hook your Switch up to and play on a TV with. It cleverly replaces the official Switch dock and its separate charger. It supports 4k 60Hz video transmission and lets you enjoy a better gaming experience on a big TV even when you’re not at home.  
 
More Immersive Gaming Experience Dongii comes with Bluetooth 5.0 standard, which allows it to connect the Switch audio to any Bluetooth-enabled audio devices. Stream audio to your favorite headphones or earbuds and enjoy a more immersive gaming experience without disturbing others. 
Connect to your favorite headphone Dongii is compatible with all the Bluetooth headphones or speakers that support aptX LL, aptX, HSP, A2DP, SBC, AFH standard.   3 steps to connect your favorite Bluetooth audio devices.  
  
Safe To Use The early stage of the USB-C protocol was imperfect. It caused large voltage fluctuations when used with Switch because it didn’t match with the Switch protocol. Other no-name aftermarket docks have proven unreliable with suspect quality that could damage your Switch. Now, after years of optimization, USB-C protocol has comprehensively improved. After countless rounds of testing and optimizing, Dongii delivers the proper voltage and amperage to the Switch based on its battery level and ensures the best and safest performance.    
 
 
 Ultra-compact, Just Pack and Go  Save space, lighten your load and hit the road without taking the heavy original Switch docking station and separate charger with you. Dongii is perfect for carrying around or traveling. Just throw it in your bag and away you go. 

Just pack and go
 
65W Detachable GaN Charger Built using the latest GaN (Gallium Nitride) technology, Dongii is much smaller, more efficient and delivers better performance and heat dissipation compared to traditional power adapters. 
 The GaN charger can be detached from the dock and accommodate any of your existing USB-C chargers. A simple way to make your charger more powerful and multifunctional. Turn your existing charger into a Dongii We also make Dongii a truly portable charger since it is perfectly compatible with the PD power bank! No more worries about running out of your devices' batteries on the road. If you want to charge your laptop or Nintendo Switch, it would be better to use a power bank with 45W or higher power output. Macbook request a 20V output and Nintendo Switch requests a 15V output. Fits your PD power bank
 
 Travel-friendly Design  Keeping global traveling needs in mind, Dongii comes with UK/EU/US pin converters that can work safely in almost any country. 
  
 
 
  Dongii comes with USB-C, USB-A and HDMI display ports to fit all your needs on any occasion at any time. Dongii is not only designed for Nintendo Switch, but can work as a fast-charger, an adapter or even a hub for your laptops, tablets or smartphones.  
 
Cutting your charging time in half The USB-C port supports the PD 3.0 quick charging standard. You can easily charge your devices at much faster speeds. Charge your smartphone
 
Quick Access To Your Drive’s Data The USB-A port supports the QC 3.0 standard and allows you to access your USB drive, mouse or controller. Read the USB drive
 
Stream On A Big Monitor The HDMI display port supports 4K 60Hz video transmission for stunning visuals. Hook up Dongii to your laptop and display your presentation on a big monitor. It eliminates complicated connections, saves time, and makes your work look great.  Perfect for meetings Connect your laptop to a large monitor to mirror or extend your screen and super-size your efficiency.  Double your productivity

I always had a fascination with taking existing rules and modifying them, or developing new ideas and stories. I became inspired to create my own games around the end of 2013 by a number of game designers such as Matt Leacock (Pandemic, Forbidden Island), James Earnest (Cheapass Games), Jesse Harasta; a high school friend who produced and crowd funded his own game, and the simple sage advice: ""Why not just do it?""</p><p>So welcome, friends, to this creative journey. Bounty is a card game I developed directly inspired by the style and simplicity of the classic Cheapass Games. The game itself contains a deck of 108 cards, and in order to play it you will need a pile of around 150 coins, chips, or tokens (I recommend coins given the theme of the game). In Bounty, the players take on the role of admirals commanding a fleet of ships searching for gold to bring home to their nations. Players send out ships that collect gold over time, and they must then reel in the bounty before their enterprising opponents decide to destroy (or even steal!) their most valuable ships. And no seafaring game would be complete without pirates, which signal the end of this game.</p><p>This project is all about the journey. I am the creative mind behind the rules and the function of the cards. I have had the opportunity to reach out to artists to help bring the cards alive, and now I have the opportunity to reach out to all of you to get this game out into the world. My top goal with this project is to get copies of the game into the hands of people I have never met, who I know will get hours of entertainment. As a result, I am not looking to make much money on the project, and am attempting to provide the game for as cheap as possible in an effort to attract more supporters.</p><h3>Gameplay</h3><p>Players begin with a small fleet in play, and each turn their ships gather gold. The players may play additional ships in order to gather more gold per turn. However, you must play ""Bounty"" cards to actually secure the gold. The longer a ship is in play, the more gold it collects, but press your luck too long and the other players will set their greedy and jealous eyes on your overflowing holds.</p><p>Players can attack each other's ships in an attempt to send them (and the gold they contain) to the bottom of the sea. They may even try to steal the ship entirely and take its bounty for their own.</p><p>Finally, beware the Jolly Roger that means pirates are coming to plunder everyone's ships!</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">What We Need</span><br/></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;""></span></p><p>Much of the reward for me is the process of creating and the excitement of carrying this project out. The game, however, costs money to produce, so that is where you come in!</p><p>I have set the goal for the project at $1000 which will allow me to buy all the copies that you as backers order, as well as a few copies that I can take to game stores or send to distributors/publishers for more visibility. Some of the funds will also go to the artist, since I certainly do not have the artistic skills to make this happen. I will also be offering a few stretch goals as we near this initial $1000 goal that will be group rewards (that is, if the stretch goal is met, everyone wins!).</p><p>Since the game is complete, and the art is being produced as we speak, all funds raised will go toward purchasing copies of the game and paying the artist, even if the goal is not met.</p><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">What you get (Perks)</span></p><p>Every donation of $5 helps this project move forward a little bit more, and you will have my sincerest gratitude. I will send you a thank-you note, and a signed copy of 1 card from the game.</p><p>$15 - A complete copy of the game with a rule book</p><p>$20 - I will hand-make you a copy of the game with the original sketches. I'm no where near as precise as a machine, and the cards will be quite a bit lower quality than the actual product. The edges will be rough and uneven, and many of the cards will have guidelines from slight miscuts. Cards will be printed on card stock and painstakingly cut by hand. So why is this a perk? I will only make a few like this so it is a unique item. You also get the satisfaction of making me work for my money!

I always had a fascination with taking existing rules and modifying them, or developing new ideas and stories. I became inspired to create my own games around the end of 2013 by a number of game designers such as Matt Leacock (Pandemic, Forbidden Island), James Earnest (Cheapass Games), Jesse Harasta; a high school friend who produced and crowd funded his own game, and the simple sage advice: ""Why not just do it?""So welcome, friends, to this creative journey. Bounty is a card game I developed directly inspired by the style and simplicity of the classic Cheapass Games. The game itself contains a deck of 108 cards, and in order to play it you will need a pile of around 150 coins, chips, or tokens (I recommend coins given the theme of the game). In Bounty, the players take on the role of admirals commanding a fleet of ships searching for gold to bring home to their nations. Players send out ships that collect gold over time, and they must then reel in the bounty before their enterprising opponents decide to destroy (or even steal!) their most valuable ships. And no seafaring game would be complete without pirates, which signal the end of this game.This project is all about the journey. I am the creative mind behind the rules and the function of the cards. I have had the opportunity to reach out to artists to help bring the cards alive, and now I have the opportunity to reach out to all of you to get this game out into the world. My top goal with this project is to get copies of the game into the hands of people I have never met, who I know will get hours of entertainment. As a result, I am not looking to make much money on the project, and am attempting to provide the game for as cheap as possible in an effort to attract more supporters.GameplayPlayers begin with a small fleet in play, and each turn their ships gather gold. The players may play additional ships in order to gather more gold per turn. However, you must play ""Bounty"" cards to actually secure the gold. The longer a ship is in play, the more gold it collects, but press your luck too long and the other players will set their greedy and jealous eyes on your overflowing holds.Players can attack each other's ships in an attempt to send them (and the gold they contain) to the bottom of the sea. They may even try to steal the ship entirely and take its bounty for their own.Finally, beware the Jolly Roger that means pirates are coming to plunder everyone's ships!What We NeedMuch of the reward for me is the process of creating and the excitement of carrying this project out. The game, however, costs money to produce, so that is where you come in!I have set the goal for the project at $1000 which will allow me to buy all the copies that you as backers order, as well as a few copies that I can take to game stores or send to distributors/publishers for more visibility. Some of the funds will also go to the artist, since I certainly do not have the artistic skills to make this happen. I will also be offering a few stretch goals as we near this initial $1000 goal that will be group rewards (that is, if the stretch goal is met, everyone wins!).Since the game is complete, and the art is being produced as we speak, all funds raised will go toward purchasing copies of the game and paying the artist, even if the goal is not met.What you get (Perks)Every donation of $5 helps this project move forward a little bit more, and you will have my sincerest gratitude. I will send you a thank-you note, and a signed copy of 1 card from the game.$15 - A complete copy of the game with a rule book$20 - I will hand-make you a copy of the game with the original sketches. I'm no where near as precise as a machine, and the cards will be quite a bit lower quality than the actual product. The edges will be rough and uneven, and many of the cards will have guidelines from slight miscuts. Cards will be printed on card stock and painstakingly cut by hand. So why is this a perk? I will only make a few like this so it is a unique item. You also get the satisfaction of making me work for my money! Think of it as your very own personalized deck that no one else has!$25 - A donation at this level does much to help the project. Pick this option if you would not like a copy of the game, but still wish to support the project. Your name will appear in the rule book under ""Donors"" and I will send you a thank-you note with a signed copy of 1 card from the game.$25 - One copy of the game and your name in the rule book under ""Donors""$25 - Two copies of the game with rule books, at a $5 discount! Perfect for gifts.$50 - Earns you the right to christen one of the ship cards in the deck, and gets you a signed copy of the game with a rule book. The ships are split into 4 nations: Dutch, English, French, and Spanish. You can pick the perk specific to the nation you want, and I will ascribe your name to one ship card of the chosen nation! Your name will also appear in the rule book.$55 - The big bundle, 5 copies of the game at an average of $11 per copy, even better for gifts, or for game stores looking to put a few copies of the game out on the shelves.$75 - Two copies of the game and your name in the rule book under ""Supporters""",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Project Summary</h3>
<p>Hey Folks.  My Name is Duncan.  When I got into Unity and Atavism I found it was lacking a Feature I needed.  The Ability to use the Skinned Mesh Gear in my game.  I had never seen C# before (HTML Background) but taught myself enough to finally get it going.  This expanded into a full blown Addon.  Now, 2.5 years later its going to be integrated into Atavism.</p>
<p>But like anything that goes good, I kept adding to it.  Now I have All weapons setup, models, etc ready to go for any Synty user to make the models Drag and Drop into Atavism, We have an IK Hands script setup that does not require any assets (this is free), The Character customizer for Atavism, and we are working on a Full Animation Controller using Explosive RPGs Animations.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Right now the Add-on is more than usable.  However It could be better.  We have all worked on it for free, and it is getting harder and harder to keep going with no money (we all have families to support).</p>
<p>I am gonna do the Break down here by where the Money will be going and what it will be used for:</p>
<ul>
<li>The First $250 will be offered to TonanBora to finish the Animation Controller.  Each weapon Type added, IK Scripts pre-implemented and ready.  Getting this done would complete the Add-on as I originally Envisioned it. </li>
<li>**Post Removed. ** I did not talk to the person I wanted to Gift $100 to for the Help I have received and this upset them that I would Name Drop them here and offer this accordingly.  As such I have removed the Post.</li>
<li>Beyond that, if we can get another $500 that basically pays for a week of me working on the Add-on Full time.  This will be to update the Weapon and shield placements, Setup the IK Hands, and Rest Positions (Atavism Only).<br/>- Doing this would also allow us to release a General Version to the Public (Non-Atavism) to be used in Any Unity Version.</li>
<li>The General Release would Include the Weapons/Shields Setup, Fully ready to use Animation Controller, and IK Hands Setup without needing other Assets like Final IK.  Its 100% script based.</li>
<li>Any further Money would be split to support the Members working on this Add-on</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>Time is Money.  Making a Game, Especially if your an Indie Dev is a LARGE task.  This Addon lets you drag and drop the Synty Models into your game and basically be done with them.  Without the Add-on you need to setup all the Scripts for your Models.  Place Weapons/Shields.  Adjust the Position and Rotation, and sometimes scales for each Weapon and Shield (over 400).  It takes a lot of time.<br/><br/>In addition, IK Hands Assets can be hard to setup, or be expensive.  We got you covered at no extra charges.  Same goes with the animation controller, being fully setup and ready to go using Explosives RPG Animation pack.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Honestly the Only Risk here is Not hitting the Goal.  We have this add-on Usable now.  We just want to make it less work on you.</p>
<p>We are setup on a Flexible Goal.  So even if we do not hit the Goal, the money will still come through.  <br/> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<h3><img alt=""Decorative Heading: The Mission"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ninmunanmu.com/nn_igg_banner_the_mission.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p>So there are a lot of big, scary problems in the world today. Problems like sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. I don't have solutions to those problems, but I do have the ability to make games and tell stories.</p>
<p>So here's the plan: I want to make a game that's fun and challenging. That game will tell a story that's interesting and engaging. That story will get people thinking about real social problems. Those people will finish the game and stop playing it, but they'll keep thinking about the problems. With any luck, some of them will start thinking about solutions.</p>
<p>And every time someone starts thinking about solutions, the world becomes a slightly better place to live.</p>
<p>This is how artists and storytellers have been changing the world since the dawn of human history; now it's my turn. With your help I'm going to make this game, tell this story, and get people thinking.</p>
<p><img alt=""Decorative Heading: Project Overview"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ninmunanmu.com/nn_igg_banner_project_overview.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/>First of all, a few general goals of the project:Alright, now it's time to talk about what I'm really planning to do here. Right now I'm going to have to keep things kind of general because I'm still a long way from a finished game and I don't make promises I can't keep; even so, I have a strong vision for the finished game and I'll try to share that vision in as much detail as I can.</p>
<ul>
<li>Compatible with Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux</li>
<li>Playable beta within six months, completed within a year.</li>
<li>Flexible engine to facilitate mods, add-ons, and sequels.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt=""Decorative Heading: The Story"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ninmunanmu.com/nn_igg_banner_the_story.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The story of Ninmu Nanmu follows Anarchy, the guy/girl wearing red you may have seen in illustrations above. He's a fairly normal guy living in the near future, just trying to find his way in the world. He's got a job he hates, a one-room apartment, and an unshakable sense that something is missing. </p>
<p>On an ordinary night at a club with his friends, Anarchy is accidentally exposed to an alchemical experiment; he is immediately transformed into a female version of himself. The situation rapidly spirals out of his control as he is caught in a crossfire between the Circle of Mages and the Artificer Union; two secret societies, each intent on concealing the accident and turning it to their own advantage.</p>
<p>In the chaos that ensues, Anarchy and his friends join forces with some other club-goers caught up in the experiment; together they are pulled into a world of secrets governed by ancient pacts. Several opposing factions compete for their custody; lies are told and threats are made, but they will not give up easily.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Anarchy struggles to come to terms with his new gender and the revelation that it might be the result of his own secret desires. What does this mean for his future and his relationships? Will he be able to return to being male? Would he even want to, given the chance?</p>
<p>The game will focus on these types of suspenseful situations and character conflicts while giving the player a chance to make choices that will affect the final outcome and the course of the story.</p>
<p><img alt=""Decorative Heading: The Gameplay"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ninmunanmu.com/nn_igg_banner_the_gameplay.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>All of this takes place in an open world that gives the player plenty of space to explore, seen from a 2D side-scrolling perspective. You'll run, jump, and fight your way past enemies and obstacles. You'll solve puzzles, search for secrets, and meet dozens of colorful characters with their own stories to tell.</p>
<p>There will be six playable characters, all members of the main cast and central to the main story. Each one has their own play style, move set, and powerups; pick your favorite and stick with it or switch characters at will.</p>
<p>I've got lots of other plans for the finished game, but I'll be keeping most of them under my hat for now. Game design is always an ongoing process; I can tell you what kind of game I'm going to make, but the details won't be certain until much later into development.</p>

<h3><img alt=""Decorative Heading: About the Team"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ninmunanmu.com/nn_igg_banner_about_the_team.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p>Alright, so I'm talking pretty big but you're wondering if I can really do this. It's a totally valid concern, and fortunately my answer is fairly straightforward: I've already done it before.</p>
<p>I've already made <a href=""http://ninmunanmu.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">comics that are funny and exciting</a>; on some occasions I've even <a href=""http://ninmunanmu.com/A_Personal_Decision_Cover_Page.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">moved readers to tears</a>. I've already made <a href=""http://fav.me/d59uvpb"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">games that are fast-paced and challenging</a>, with vibrant art and solid mechanics.</p>
<p>There's just one part of this project that I haven't done before: I've never been able to work full-time on a large scale project with a greater goal in mind. That's where you come in; if this project gets funded, I'll finally have everything I need to bring all the pieces together.</p>
<p>Joining me for this project will be two of my friends who are also two of the most talented and reliable people I have ever known: Jeremy Smith and Cameron McLagan. I'll be handling the larger part of the project, but they'll be on call when their skills and specialties are needed; Jeremy is great for story ideas and for pointing out my mistakes while Cameron is a programmer and is particularly good at the sorts of mind-bending algorithm code I hate working on.</p>

<h3><img alt=""Decorative Heading: The Rewards"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ninmunanmu.com/nn_igg_banner_the_rewards.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p>Here's the full run-down on what you can get by supporting this project.</p>
<h4>$5 / The Fuzzy Feeling</h4>
<p>Your name (or an alias) will appear in the credits, and you'll get that warm fuzzy feeling you get from supporting an indie project.</p>
<h4>$10 / The Game</h4>
<p>Your name in the credits, one fuzzy feeling, and a full copy of the game as soon as it's finished.</p>
<h4>$20 / The Value Pack</h4>
<p>Your name in the credits, one fuzzy feeling, <em>three</em> copies of the game so you can share, and regular email updates with cool stuff like concept art, screenshots, and testing versions of the game.</p>
<h4><span style=""font-size: 1em;"">$50 / OMG Real Paper</span></h4>
<p>Everything from the value pack and I will hand-write a personal thank-you letter and mail it to you along with a full page of concept art drawn for the game. I'll start sending these out as soon as the campaign is funded, and I'll send them as quickly as I can write letters and draw concept art.</p>
<p>Naturally, I'll need an address to mail the letter to. If you don't have a permanent address or you'd rather not share it, I'll be happy to email scanned copies of your letter and drawing to you.</p>
<h4><span style=""font-size: 1em;"">$100 / Even More Paper</span></h4>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1em;"">The value pack, a thank-you letter with concept art, plus two more pages of of pencil drawings! These pages can be more concept art, or I can draw something else at your request. Just like above, I'll start these as soon as the game is funded and I'll send them out as soon as I can have them ready.</span></p>
<h4><span style=""font-size: 1em;"">$200 / Minor NPC</span></h4>
<p>All the same rewards as the ""Even More Paper"" perk and I'll design a character based on you who will appear as a Minor NPC in the finished game; Every Minor NPC will have his or her own name, portrait, sprite, and something interesting to say to the player.</p>
<p>If you're shy, your character doesn't need to be based on you; we can just make something up! In either case, I'll create an interesting and compelling character that fits in with the rest of the game world.</p>
<h4>$500 / Significant NPC</h4>
<p>At this level, your character is upgraded to Significant NPC status. He or she will gain full-body artwork, basic animations, more extensive dialogue, and a gender-swapped form that can be triggered by the player or story events.</p>
<p>If for any reason you don't want your character to be gender-swapped, I could do something else like an alternate costume or some other type of transformation.</p>
<h4>$1000 / Major NPC</h4>
<p>At this level, your character attains Major NPC status. He or she gains additional artwork for different moods and emotions, extensive dialogue, and a personal quest or sub-plot that expands on the character's personality and background.</p>
<p>If you have your own ideas for your character's story, I'd love to work them in; if not, I'm happy to write it on my own. Either way, your character will be a living part of the story.</p>
<h4>$2000 / Playable Character</h4>
<p>At this level your character is no longer an NPC at all; her or she is a fully-playable character who joins the main storyline alongside Anarchy and the others. This means full artwork and animations, personal quests and storylines, and a role in the main storyline of the game.</p>
<p>This is the big one; the ultimate way to be a part of the Ninmu Nanmu story. You bring the character concept, and I'll bring it to life with all of the same care and effort I put into my own characters.</p>
<p><img alt=""Decorative Heading: The Budget"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ninmunanmu.com/nn_igg_banner_the_budget.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Most of the money goes toward paying me for the time and effort of making the game. Most of that will get spent on stuff like rent, groceries, electricity, etc. I'd also like to buy some new socks.  You can rest assured I won't be spending your money on huge TVs or fancy restaurants or anything; I'm much more likely to stock up on canned goods.</p>
<p>The other main expense will be paying other people for their help. I plan to hire one or more independent musicians for the game's sound track, and of course my fellow team members will be paid fairly.</p>
<p>Depending on how the budget works out and whether we exceed the goal, I may also use funding for some of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Repair my computer so it's reliable during development.</li>
<li>Additional computers for easier cross-platform coding/testing.</li>
<li>A bigger/newer tablet for working on the game's art.</li>
<li>A nicer desk and a chair for long hours of art and coding.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt=""Decorative Heading: Push Goals"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ninmunanmu.com/nn_igg_banner_push_goals.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>On the topic of money and what I plan to do with it, here are some rough ideas of what I'll add to the project if I get extra funding.</p>
<h4>$7500 / Expanded Content</h4>
<p>I'm going to have more ideas than can possibly fit into one game, but with a little extra funding I can save a lot of them from the cutting room floor. The main storyline will be extended and there will be substantially more optional content to explore.</p>
<h4>$10000 / Expanded Gameplay</h4>
<p>With double the original funding, I can start adding features to the gameplay. This would probably mean expanded move-sets for all playable characters, a wider variety of enemies/obstacles/puzzles, and other stuff I haven't even thought of. As a side effect, the whole game would end up longer and more diverse than the basic plan.</p>
<p><img alt=""Decorative Heading: Other Ways to Help"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ninmunanmu.com/nn_igg_banner_other_ways_to_help.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>If you can't support the project financially, you can still help by spreading the word! I would be super grateful if you post about it on your twitter/facebook/tumblr/whatever. There even some handy buttons near the top of the page to help you out with that.</p>
<p><img alt=""Decorative Heading: Check back soon!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ninmunanmu.com/nn_igg_banner_check_back_soon.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>That's pretty much all the information and persuasion I have for you right now. I'll be updating things as the campaign progresses, so be sure to check back often!</p>

First of all, a few general goals of the project:Alright, now it's time to talk about what I'm really planning to do here. Right now I'm going to have to keep things kind of general because I'm still a long way from a finished game and I don't make promises I can't keep; even so, I have a strong vision for the finished game and I'll try to share that vision in as much detail as I can.

Compatible with Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux
Playable beta within six months, completed within a year.
Flexible engine to facilitate mods, add-ons, and sequels.


The story of Ninmu Nanmu follows Anarchy, the guy/girl wearing red you may have seen in illustrations above. He's a fairly normal guy living in the near future, just trying to find his way in the world. He's got a job he hates, a one-room apartment, and an unshakable sense that something is missing. 
On an ordinary night at a club with his friends, Anarchy is accidentally exposed to an alchemical experiment; he is immediately transformed into a female version of himself. The situation rapidly spirals out of his control as he is caught in a crossfire between the Circle of Mages and the Artificer Union; two secret societies, each intent on concealing the accident and turning it to their own advantage.
In the chaos that ensues, Anarchy and his friends join forces with some other club-goers caught up in the experiment; together they are pulled into a world of secrets governed by ancient pacts. Several opposing factions compete for their custody; lies are told and threats are made, but they will not give up easily.
Meanwhile, Anarchy struggles to come to terms with his new gender and the revelation that it might be the result of his own secret desires. What does this mean for his future and his relationships? Will he be able to return to being male? Would he even want to, given the chance?
The game will focus on these types of suspenseful situations and character conflicts while giving the player a chance to make choices that will affect the final outcome and the course of the story.

All of this takes place in an open world that gives the player plenty of space to explore, seen from a 2D side-scrolling perspective. You'll run, jump, and fight your way past enemies and obstacles. You'll solve puzzles, search for secrets, and meet dozens of colorful characters with their own stories to tell.
There will be six playable characters, all members of the main cast and central to the main story. Each one has their own play style, move set, and powerups; pick your favorite and stick with it or switch characters at will.
I've got lots of other plans for the finished game, but I'll be keeping most of them under my hat for now. Game design is always an ongoing process; I can tell you what kind of game I'm going to make, but the details won't be certain until much later into development.



Alright, so I'm talking pretty big but you're wondering if I can really do this. It's a totally valid concern, and fortunately my answer is fairly straightforward: I've already done it before.
I've already made comics that are funny and exciting; on some occasions I've even moved readers to tears. I've already made games that are fast-paced and challenging, with vibrant art and solid mechanics.
There's just one part of this project that I haven't done before: I've never been able to work full-time on a large scale project with a greater goal in mind. That's where you come in; if this project gets funded, I'll finally have everything I need to bring all the pieces together.
Joining me for this project will be two of my friends who are also two of the most talented and reliable people I have ever known: Jeremy Smith and Cameron McLagan. I'll be handling the larger part of the project, but they'll be on call when their skills and specialties are needed; Jeremy is great for story ideas and for pointing out my mistakes while Cameron is a programmer and is particularly good at the sorts of mind-bending algorithm code I hate working on.
 



Here's the full run-down on what you can get by supporting this project.
$5 / The Fuzzy Feeling
Your name (or an alias) will appear in the credits, and you'll get that warm fuzzy feeling you get from supporting an indie project.
$10 / The Game
Your name in the credits, one fuzzy feeling, and a full copy of the game as soon as it's finished.
$20 / The Value Pack
Your name in the credits, one fuzzy feeling, three copies of the game so you can share, and regular email updates with cool stuff like concept art, screenshots, and testing versions of the game.
$50 / OMG Real Paper
Everything from the value pack and I will hand-write a personal thank-you letter and mail it to you along with a full page of concept art drawn for the game. I'll start sending these out as soon as the campaign is funded, and I'll send them as quickly as I can write letters and draw concept art.
Naturally, I'll need an address to mail the letter to. If you don't have a permanent address or you'd rather not share it, I'll be happy to email scanned copies of your letter and drawing to you.
$100 / Even More Paper
The value pack, a thank-you letter with concept art, plus two more pages of of pencil drawings! These pages can be more concept art, or I can draw something else at your request. Just like above, I'll start these as soon as the game is funded and I'll send them out as soon as I can have them ready.
$200 / Minor NPC
All the same rewards as the ""Even More Paper"" perk and I'll design a character based on you who will appear as a Minor NPC in the finished game; Every Minor NPC will have his or her own name, portrait, sprite, and something interesting to say to the player.
If you're shy, your character doesn't need to be based on you; we can just make something up! In either case, I'll create an interesting and compelling character that fits in with the rest of the game world.
$500 / Significant NPC
At this level, your character is upgraded to Significant NPC status. He or she will gain full-body artwork, basic animations, more extensive dialogue, and a gender-swapped form that can be triggered by the player or story events.
If for any reason you don't want your character to be gender-swapped, I could do something else like an alternate costume or some other type of transformation.
$1000 / Major NPC
At this level, your character attains Major NPC status. He or she gains additional artwork for different moods and emotions, extensive dialogue, and a personal quest or sub-plot that expands on the character's personality and background.
If you have your own ideas for your character's story, I'd love to work them in; if not, I'm happy to write it on my own. Either way, your character will be a living part of the story.
$2000 / Playable Character
At this level your character is no longer an NPC at all; her or she is a fully-playable character who joins the main storyline alongside Anarchy and the others. This means full artwork and animations, personal quests and storylines, and a role in the main storyline of the game.
This is the big one; the ultimate way to be a part of the Ninmu Nanmu story. You bring the character concept, and I'll bring it to life with all of the same care and effort I put into my own characters.

Most of the money goes toward paying me for the time and effort of making the game. Most of that will get spent on stuff like rent, groceries, electricity, etc. I'd also like to buy some new socks.  You can rest assured I won't be spending your money on huge TVs or fancy restaurants or anything; I'm much more likely to stock up on canned goods.
The other main expense will be paying other people for their help. I plan to hire one or more independent musicians for the game's sound track, and of course my fellow team members will be paid fairly.
Depending on how the budget works out and whether we exceed the goal, I may also use funding for some of the following:

Repair my computer so it's reliable during development.
Additional computers for easier cross-platform coding/testing.
A bigger/newer tablet for working on the game's art.
A nicer desk and a chair for long hours of art and coding.


On the topic of money and what I plan to do with it, here are some rough ideas of what I'll add to the project if I get extra funding.
$7500 / Expanded Content
I'm going to have more ideas than can possibly fit into one game, but with a little extra funding I can save a lot of them from the cutting room floor. The main storyline will be extended and there will be substantially more optional content to explore.
$10000 / Expanded Gameplay
With double the original funding, I can start adding features to the gameplay. This would probably mean expanded move-sets for all playable characters, a wider variety of enemies/obstacles/puzzles, and other stuff I haven't even thought of. As a side effect, the whole game would end up longer and more diverse than the basic plan.

If you can't support the project financially, you can still help by spreading the word! I would be super grateful if you post about it on your twitter/facebook/tumblr/whatever. There even some handy buttons near the top of the page to help you out with that.

That's pretty much all the information and persuasion I have for you right now. I'll be updating things as the campaign progresses, so be sure to check back often!",13.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hi there! My name is Luis Rosario and I'm the Writer/Creator for Wicked Wyrd Games. I started this endeavor because I love tabletop roleplaying and I love the sense of community one gets from spending time gaming with friends. The focus of Wicked Wyrd is to make gaming accessible to wide variety of easy to understand, easy to pick up, and easy to buy products for a variety of people. It's my ultimate goal to be able to give away some of our products to people who otherwise couldn't afford to buy a large amount of books by offering some in PDF form. In this way all kinds of people will have access to quality gaming on a budget.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The greatest impact will be allowing new ideas and new ways of having fun to circulate to a wide variety of people. I think a lot of people (especially those who don't have a lot of money) lose sight of how great it can be to just sit for a few hours and have fun. Getting these games out to people so they can try them, enjoy them, and just have fun would be an awesome thing.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The majority of this money would go to hiring a designer to do editing and layout for the current product we're producing (a game called Bazaar: The Black Market). It's also a big goal of Wicked Wyrd to get a few physical copies of the books and supplements out to local gaming stores so that people who don't have access to the internet can also give them a try. Finally, I would really like to do some advertising via Facebook to really get the word out and give more people the option to enjoy these games.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>To show my gratitude for the people who donate, anyone who gives $15 or more will get a mention in the acknowledgment section of <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Bazaar: The Black Market</span>. People who donate $25 or more will get a physical copy of Bazaar sent to them once we get some printed. Finally if anyone donates $75 or more, they will get all of the above and I will model a character in our next product after them, using their name and ideas to inspire a unique creation.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you don't have cash to donate, word of mouth would be awesome. If you know friends who are interested in RPGs and indie games in particular, point them in our direction and we'll be very appreciative. If you have digital design, print on demand (POD), or artistic skills we would also love to hear from you about donating your time or equipment to the project.<br/></p>

<strong>The target fund that I intend to raise is 500$ (about 15 backers).<br/> This goal is the minimum required to carry out an Indiegogo campaign and marks the limit I need to acquire the products and equipment needed to produce the pieces(silicones, resins, dyes, vibrating table, extractor</strong><strong> </strong><strong>...)<br/> This first limit is low and leaves no</strong><strong> </strong><strong>profit</strong><strong> </strong><strong>margin for me.

<p>Llegar a los 500$ seria ya para mi una gran alegría pero en mi meta de realizar el proyecto más completo posible busco vuestra colaboración para hacer de esto, entre todos, algo lo más grande posible; el proyecto más ambicioso de  fichas custom para Los colonos de Catan que haya existido hasta el momento.</p>
<p>Y para eso propongo diferentes escalones de recaudación para poder realizarlo:</p>

<strong>6-AND WHAT ABOUT THE FUTURE? </strong><strong>Y qué pasará en el futuro?</strong>
</h2>
<p> </p>
<h3> <strong>Who knows about future… but I ‘m absolutely sure that my intention is to follow, - although this is another question -, first I would like to see the response to the product, and if everything goes well, we’ll all know The Settlers of Catan expansions.</strong>
</h3>
<h3><strong>For my part,I let you know that I’d  be more than happy to continue customizing the game with new pieces: boats, walls, metropolis, soldiers, ports ... and who knows what else.</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Quien sabe que pasará en el futuro…pero yo tengo muy claro que mi intención es seguir, aunque esto es otra cuestión, primero me gustaria ver como se responde al producto, y en caso de que todo fluya de una buena manera todos conocemos las ampliaciones de Los colonos de Catan, y por mi parte solo comunicar que estaria mas que encantado de poder seguir customizando el juego con nuevas fichas: Barcos, murallas, metrópolis, soldados, puertos… y quien sabe que mas.</p>

<h2><strong>RISKS AND CHALLENGES / riesgos y desafíos</strong></h2>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3>This is my first project on a crowdfunding platform but this is not my first time using silicone and resins to make miniatures. For years my friends and I have used these materials to make copies and use them in a large number of our hobbies.</h3>
<h3>
<br/> If the project is approved but reaches no stretch goals, it’s only a matter of production as the pieces are already made, except the 6th civilization that will be made before the end of the fundraising period. In this case the delivery date may be advanced.</h3>
<h3>
<br/> If the project is approved and reaches levels of stretch goals, the work process will change since I’ll need more time for the design and  the production because the total set will be more expanded.<br/> The upside is that now I have no employment obligations so I can dedicate my whole time to complete the project and I have several friends in the same situation that could join the production process if necessary, so that a greater number of orders would not be a problem,  it would rather be a blessing.</h3>
<p> </p>
<h3> </h3>
<p>Este es mi primer proyecto en una plataforma de Crowdfunding pero no soy nuevo en el uso de siliconas y resinas para hacer miniaturas. Durante años mis amigos y yo hemos utilizado estos materiales para sacar copias y utilizarlas en un un gran numero de nuestros hobbies.</p>
<p>Si el proyecto es aprobado pero no alcanza ningúna meta de recaudación( stretch goal), tan solo será cuestión de producirlo ya que las fichas ya están hechas, a falta de la 6ª civilización que estará realizada antes de que acabe el periodo de recaudación. En este caso la fecha de entrega será posiblemente adelantada.</p>
<p>Si el proyecto es aprobado y alcanza niveles de stretch goals el proceso de trabajo cambiara ya que tendré que utilizar mas tiempo en el diseño y también en su producción ya que el total de packs será superior.El lado positivo es que ahora no tengo ninguna obligación laboral por lo que mi horario diario puede ser utilizado integro al proyecto y tengo varios amigos en la misma situación que podrían unirse al proceso de producción en caso de ser necesario, con lo cual un mayor numero de encargos no seria un problema si no mas bien una bendición.</p>
<p> </p></span></span></span></span></div>","1-WHAT DO I OFFER? / Qué es lo que ofrezco?
The project I propose is a set of themed game pieces in 6 of the great civilizations of antiquity which will be compatible, among others, with The Settlers of Catan boardgame.
El proyecto que propongo son fichas de juego tematizadas en 6 de las grandes civilizaciones de la antigüedad y que serán compatible, entre otros, con el juego Los Colonos de Catan.
 

 
 

Romans, Greeks, Egyptians, Chinese, Aztecs and Hindus, will have their new pieces, which will enrich our gaming experience and will be made of solid polyurethane resin and dyed in the different colors of the game . Each set contains: 4 cities, 5 settlements and 15 roads.

 
Romanos, Griegos, Egipcios, Chinos, Aztecas y Hindus, tendrán sus respectivas nuevas fichas, que enriquecerán nuestra experiencia de juego y estarán realizadas en resina de poliuretano maciza y tintadas en los diferentes colores del juego. Cada pack contendrá: 4 ciudades, 5 poblados y 15 caminos. 
 

 
 
 The pieces are created with a hybrid modeling process using the classic hand modeling for the bases and 3D computer modeling and printing for buildings.
 Las fichas han sido creadas con un proceso hibrido entre el clásico modelado a mano para las bases y el modelado en 3D por ordenador y posterior impresión de los edificios.

 2- WHAT DO I NEED?/ Que necesito?
 

The target fund that I intend to raise is 500$ (about 15 backers). This goal is the minimum required to carry out an Indiegogo campaign and marks the limit I need to acquire the products and equipment needed to produce the pieces(silicones, resins, dyes, vibrating table, extractor ...) This first limit is low and leaves no profit margin for me. This has a reason:  as being a fan of the game, the most important in the first place for me is to produce and this way to be able to share these pieces with other players like me around the world.

 
La meta que me propongo recaudar son 500$ ( mas o menos 15 backers).
Esta cifra es el mínimo necesario para realizar una campaña en Indiegogo y marca el límite que necesito para poder adquirir los productos y maquinaria necesarios para producir las fichas ( siliconas, resinas, mesa vibrado, tintes, mesa de vibrado, extractor…)
Este primer límite es bajo y no deja margen de ganancia por mi parte, esto tiene una razón; como fan del juego que soy, lo importante en primera instancia es llegar a producirlo y poder así compartir estas fichas con otros jugadores como yo alrededor del mundo.
 
 

 
 
3- IS THAT ALL?/ Es esto todo?
 
No, that’s not all ...or at least I hope so. Reaching the $500 target would already be a great pleasure for me, but to be able to make the most complete possible project, I seek your cooperation to make together the most ambitious project of custom pieces  for The Settlers of Catan that has existed so far. To reach this, I propose different stretch goals:
 
No, no es todo… o al menos eso espero
Llegar a los 500$ seria ya para mi una gran alegría pero en mi meta de realizar el proyecto más completo posible busco vuestra colaboración para hacer de esto, entre todos, algo lo más grande posible; el proyecto más ambicioso de  fichas custom para Los colonos de Catan que haya existido hasta el momento.
Y para eso propongo diferentes escalones de recaudación para poder realizarlo:
 
 STRETCH GOALS:

 

 
 
 At this point, an extra model of  settlement will be made for each of the six civilizations, which means that each civilization will have 3 of their settlements of the original model and 2 of the new one.
Llegados a este punto se realizará 1 modelo extra de poblado para cada una de las 6 civilizaciones, con lo cual, cada civilización tendrá 3 de sus poblados del modelo original y 2 del nuevo modelo. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 


 
 At this point, an extra model of  city will be made for each of the six civilizations, which means that each civilization will have 2 of their cities of the original model and 2 of the new one.
Llegados a este punto se realizará 1 modelo extra de ciudad para cada una de las 6 civilizaciones, con lo cual, cada civilización tendrá 2 de sus ciudades del modelo original y 2 del modelo nuevo.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 


 
 
 At this point,an extra model of  settlement will be made for each of the six civilizations, which means that each civilization will have 2 of their settlements of the original model, 2 of the first extra model and 1 of the new one.
Llegados a este punto se realizará 1 modelo extra de poblado para cada una de las 6 civilizaciones, con lo cual, cada civilización tendrá 2 de sus poblados del modelo original, 2 del primer modelo extra y 1 del modelo nuevo.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 

 

 
 At this point,an extra model of city will be made for each of the six civilizations, which means that each civilization will have 2 of their cities of the original model, 1 of the first extra model and 1 of the new one.
Llegados a este punto se realizará 1 modelo extra de ciudad para cada una de las 6 civilizaciones, con lo cual, cada civilización tendrá 2 de sus ciudades del modelo original, 1 del primer modelo extra y 1 del nuevo modelo.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 



 At this point, to do the most complete project in appreciation to the backers, I fuse the last three Stretch goals in one.
Two extra models of settlement and one extra model of city will be made for each of the six civilizations, which means that each civilization will have their 5 models of settlement and 4 models of city different.


Llegados a este punto, para poder realizar el proyecto más completo posible y en agradecimiento a todos los colaboradores, he tomado la decision de fusionar las tres ultimas metas de recaudacion en una.
Dos modelos extra de poblado y un modelo extra de ciudad seran realizados para cada una de las 6 civilizaciones, con lo cual, cada civilizacion tendrá sus 5 poblados y sus 4 ciudades diferentes entre ellos

6-AND WHAT ABOUT THE FUTURE? Y qué pasará en el futuro?

 
 Who knows about future… but I ‘m absolutely sure that my intention is to follow, - although this is another question -, first I would like to see the response to the product, and if everything goes well, we’ll all know The Settlers of Catan expansions.

For my part,I let you know that I’d  be more than happy to continue customizing the game with new pieces: boats, walls, metropolis, soldiers, ports ... and who knows what else.
 
Quien sabe que pasará en el futuro…pero yo tengo muy claro que mi intención es seguir, aunque esto es otra cuestión, primero me gustaria ver como se responde al producto, y en caso de que todo fluya de una buena manera todos conocemos las ampliaciones de Los colonos de Catan, y por mi parte solo comunicar que estaria mas que encantado de poder seguir customizando el juego con nuevas fichas: Barcos, murallas, metrópolis, soldados, puertos… y quien sabe que mas.

RISKS AND CHALLENGES / riesgos y desafíos
 
This is my first project on a crowdfunding platform but this is not my first time using silicone and resins to make miniatures. For years my friends and I have used these materials to make copies and use them in a large number of our hobbies.

 If the project is approved but reaches no stretch goals, it’s only a matter of production as the pieces are already made, except the 6th civilization that will be made before the end of the fundraising period. In this case the delivery date may be advanced.

 If the project is approved and reaches levels of stretch goals, the work process will change since I’ll need more time for the design and  the production because the total set will be more expanded. The upside is that now I have no employment obligations so I can dedicate my whole time to complete the project and I have several friends in the same situation that could join the production process if necessary, so that a greater number of orders would not be a problem,  it would rather be a blessing.
 
 
Este es mi primer proyecto en una plataforma de Crowdfunding pero no soy nuevo en el uso de siliconas y resinas para hacer miniaturas. Durante años mis amigos y yo hemos utilizado estos materiales para sacar copias y utilizarlas en un un gran numero de nuestros hobbies.
Si el proyecto es aprobado pero no alcanza ningúna meta de recaudación( stretch goal), tan solo será cuestión de producirlo ya que las fichas ya están hechas, a falta de la 6ª civilización que estará realizada antes de que acabe el periodo de recaudación. En este caso la fecha de entrega será posiblemente adelantada.
Si el proyecto es aprobado y alcanza niveles de stretch goals el proceso de trabajo cambiara ya que tendré que utilizar mas tiempo en el diseño y también en su producción ya que el total de packs será superior.El lado positivo es que ahora no tengo ninguna obligación laboral por lo que mi horario diario puede ser utilizado integro al proyecto y tengo varios amigos en la misma situación que podrían unirse al proceso de producción en caso de ser necesario, con lo cual un mayor numero de encargos no seria un problema si no mas bien una bendición.",27.0,0,"2 Campaigns

</div></div></div>","POSTWORLD is a mixture of hurricane shooter, hardcore souls-like slasher and contemplative post apocalyptic survival gameplay with a multi-path role-playing system and a non-linear plot.The game events take place in 2120, after a lengthy period of civilization’s gradual collapse has resulted in a nuclear war. Several factions are savagely striving for survival throughout the dead wastelands, and the player character threads his way between them, all while trying to escape from agents of the mysterious Corporation hunting his down.The development has been being done by a small Russian indie studio Screwdriver Entertainment, supported by the community, for 2 years already. The game has been done for about 75% so far. All of it has taken us 2 years and approximately 20 000$.We have decided to give away POSTWORLD Alpha to get your feedback and prove that we really have working game at this moment!Here is the link:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zu4ADKmS39cRYK...Please, check it out and support us to get much better game this autumn!The game is going to be released on Steam Autumn 2018 no matter what the campaign results will be. Indiegogo simply let us emerge from the shadows and raise a certain amount of money to be spent on adding new content, better localization and tweaking the product.Also it will grant our community a favorable opportunity to join alpha testers now and get the POSTWORLD key on Steam upcoming autumn.Apocalypse did not come in an instant: it took a whole century. As globalization and overpopulation were gradually contributing to weakening national governments and spreading pest holes of chaos, transnational corporations were increasing their influence, and by the mid-to-late twenty-first century the world had been turned into their battleground and military test site.Animal mutations, unknown epidemics outbreaks, dirty bombs owned by radical cults – it all had become trivial. The majority of mankind had already fallen into the darkness of ignorance, when the growing pressure was finally released in a full-scale atomic war.It happened in 2082. Nuclear flames took millions of souls. Hunger, cold, thirst, diseases and local quarrels devoured billions of them. The planet became badlands inhabited by mutants, and the rare survivors had nothing better to do with themselves than split into factions and start striving for leftovers of resources.The player will meet three of these groups: Railwaymen, Cultists and Slavers. Each faction has its own point and its own vision of the better future for the post nuclear world. The player may join any Faction and lead it either to the victory… or to the disaster.But one should also keep in mind the mysterious transnational corporation (TNC) that survived the war and tries to put the old world’s shatters to right. The player character has old grudges with this organization. He used to be a test subject in one of its secured laboratory facilities but was lucky enough to escape. However now there is an experimental implant (with quite an unstable combat AI) in his head, and the corporation’s agents are not going to let their cutting-edge technology slip through their fingers.We grant the player a large choice of devices to bring death and destruction with. Melee weapons, firearms, bulletproof shields, various ammo, explosives, stimulators: all of it combined with dozens of different skills let the player follow her preferred gaming style. A cold-blooded sharpshooter with a rifle? A doped up berserker with an axe? An armor-clad stormtrooper with a submachine-gun and a shield? Pick to your liking!     Area-based damage system allows to shoot enemies’ body parts off; but losing an arm and a leg does not matter to tough wasteland dwellers, and they go on shooting back. So that any combat encounter ends up as a blood bath!The player character may also lose a limb but it’s far from a game over, as powerful combat prostheses shall replace weak flesh. They may help the player to customize her character even deeper.Weapons are also fully customizable. Any part can be replaced: barrels, hand guards, sights and buttstocks of firearms, as well as handles, guards and blades of melee weapons. Every detail has its own stats, directly influencing on the weapon’s combat effectiveness. Ranging from simple wooden bucklers that can hardly bear an axe blow, to high tech bulletproof shields equipped with built-in flamethrowers and stunning devices, they are all an essential part of equipment. They can be customized and upgraded as well as destroyed by dense hostile fire.Quests that you receive depend on what decisions you have made and what faction you have joined. One will have to beat the game multiple times to see all possible endings.The wastelands are large, and the mechanics of travel between distinct game locations are inspired by the classical Fallout 1-2. Various events and random encounters lie in wait for the player. These may be procedurally generated combat encounters, as well as text quests à la Space Rangers.Traveling throughout vast expanses of the post apocalyptic world takes a lot of time, and the player will have to overcome hunger, thirst and sleep deprivation by clever choice of supplies and choosing safe places to rest in.It all started in February 2016 as an idea to design a post apocalyptic Action RPG to the taste of every Fallout, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. or Metro admirer. Naturally this idea attracted many postapocalypse fans, and as Unreal Engine 4 had switched to a free distribution plan, it became technically feasible for us to create the game without overwhelming expenses to buy or design an appropriate game engine.Post apocalyptic festival After Us 2017 The project was facing numerous complications from the very beginning. Our team was scattered throughout all the former USSR territory and could only work on the game in spare time. Few of us had actual design experience, understood how pipelines worked, or realized the complexity of implementing certain technical details. Different people had different vision of the project and sometimes it turned out to be impossible to come to a consensus.Long story short, we had suffered each and every trouble that any aspiring indie team usually faces. Everyone seemed to keep telling us to scale back our ambitions and have some practice with smaller projects first.POSTWORLD showcase at post apocalyptic festival After Us 2017 However, by the end of the first year we had achieved reasonable goals. Firstly, we formed an established team of people who were constantly and systematically working at the project. Secondly, we acquired our own visual style and wrote the game lore. Thirdly, a list of mechanics to be used in game was made.In spring 2017 or so we «got out into the world». From then on we have been taking part in various conferences focusing on game development (DevGAMM, White Nights) and some post apocalypse related events, all while paying much more attention to social media advertising and community management.From left to right: Nikolay Isamidinov, Chris Taylor, and Peter LeontevConcurrently we have been working hard designing the software components, testing game mechanics and adding new content. We had released and tested endless new builds getting invaluable feedback.POSTWORLD showcase at DevGAMM 2017 conference in Moscow Although we were already contemplating at launching a crowdfunding campaign, we were unwilling to impose extra obligations on ourselves and finally decided to continue the development only using internal resources.Towards the end of the year we had already had a somewhat playable prototype. It was when we made our biggest mistake: we tried to attract publishers. Meetings, discussions, scheduling, endless planning, budget development, implementation of necessary additional feature prototypes and legal matters followed as a result taking us two months – and all without any result. We joked that maybe that is all because POSTWORLD lacks loot boxes and/or Battle Royale mode.POSTWORLD showcase at post apocalyptic festival After Us 2017Having realized that we were on our own, we have proceeded with the initial schedule aiming to release on Steam Early Access in Autumn 2018.Naturally our possibilities are limited and should we rely upon our own resources alone, a lot of planned content will not be covered by Early Access and will only appear in further constant updates. It was to avoid such a situation that we started this fundraising. Thanks to Indiegogo everyone interested will be able to learn about the project as soon as possible and support it while we will be empowered to not just release the game but put it into the originally intended shape.From left to right: Nikolay Isamidinov, Peter Leontev and Michael Kemski from Obsidian EntertainmentThere are none! It might look weird, but it is true. We already have a playable Alpha version. We already invested 2 years and approximately 20000$ in POSTWORLD and we will not stop the development at any cost. Moreover we are going to fully implement above feature list. We will release the game on Steam no matter how much money the campaign will actually raise. We want to develop POSTWORLD much much further taking into account community feedback! Support us to turn this goal into reality!We launched this campaign not to design the game from scratch. What we sought was to let our community support the project that is already in progress and good state. We wanted to give all the backers Steam key to Alpha version of the game now and its automatic upgrade to release version in Autumn 2018 as our sincere gratitude for support.These are the reasons we put such a modest sum as our first goal. Everything raised in excess of it will serve to improve the project and add extra content such as new weapons, monsters and implants (see stretch goals).We believe the support is always two sided. Help us now and we will bring you more fun this autumn!

is the only mobile football manager simulation in the industry with no in-game
purchases or pay-to-win options. We want to be able to keep it this way but at
the same time give you the improvements and features that you ask for and
expect. We are a small company, with games and football fans, and as such, we
like to be part of this community and take good care of our users.</p>
<p>So we started gathering
all the requests and suggestions from all of the football managers. We evaluated
which ones are most wanted, how much time it would take us to implement and
decided that it was too long! We want to do them all, and we want to do
them much faster than what our current capabilities allow us to do. So we need
your help so that you can enjoy all of the features that you can see here!</p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/651887/files/20140616013056-4-_WHAT_IS_THE_PLAN_FOR_THE_FUNDS.png?1402907456"" src="""" style=""""/></p>We have a very particular plan on what exactly we will use the funds for!

he was in Cologne a couple of years ago. He was bored in his hotel room after a
long day and wanted to play a game that was fun, enjoyable and entertaining.
The problem was that he could not find a game that would also be free, without
in-app purchases and without other payment requirements! He saw a hole in the
market and decided to develop a game that would be both fun and free, and
pledged to keep it free at whatever the cost. We have learned so much
throughout this journey - experiments that failed, things that worked, and the
evolution of an idea that now exists as something more than just an app. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/652172/files/20140616030343-7-_FAQ.png?1402913023"" src="""" style=""width: 568px; height: 142px;""/></p><p><b>Q1: What is GFM 2014?</b></p>

Here is the plan for how the support funds will be distributed:The idea came to Arne when
he was in Cologne a couple of years ago. He was bored in his hotel room after a
long day and wanted to play a game that was fun, enjoyable and entertaining.
The problem was that he could not find a game that would also be free, without
in-app purchases and without other payment requirements! He saw a hole in the
market and decided to develop a game that would be both fun and free, and
pledged to keep it free at whatever the cost. We have learned so much
throughout this journey - experiments that failed, things that worked, and the
evolution of an idea that now exists as something more than just an app. Q1: What is GFM 2014?
GOAL 2014 Football Manager (GFM) is a mobile game for iOS and Android phones and
tablets. The game’s main focus is to let players manage their own team in order
to win the league and other competitions. It is, was and always will be free.
With GOAL 2014 FM, managers can:
·    Create their own club
·    Manage finances by
choosing sponsors, improving stadiums, setting ticket           prices etc.
·    Buy and sell players
·    Set training to improve
their player's attributes
·    Compete in 7 leagues
and a global Cup
·    Set the line-up and
choose a playing style
·    Follow the game through
the live-ticker
·    Much, much more

plan to expand our team and expertise so that we can improve the quality and
quantity of our updates and new features. The main objective however is to
increase our speed of work so that we can progress quicker with our goals, in
order to keep our football managers happy and continue to keep
it free. In the description of our campaign you can see a detailed list of the

I wont give my loyal fans alpha/beta mode only and expect them to buy the finished game... thats just wrong. So...Who Are You?Hello Everyone. My name is Justin Hornsby and I am the founder (and the only member) of an indie video game development company called Hidden Clan Studio which is currently based in me and my wife's tiny rented studio apartment. I am entirely self taught on how to make games and started tinkering with video games with my older brother when I was around 13 years old.   My goal is to provide people with fun and original games that challenge players but also allows them to feel in control of the game instead of being led from point to point. What Is Your Project's Goal?My current goal is simple but probably the most important:  Spread news about this great game to more people! No matter how great a game is, if no one knows about it, how can they enjoy it?  By helping me with this goal, you not only help someone achieve one of their dreams of making a great game that people will love, you help more people become aware of this game, which means more people to play with!What Is Wolf's Moon? So what is Wolf's Moon, you ask?  It is a 1st person multiplayer game that combines survival, teamwork, betrayal, subterfuge, and werewolves.  The premises of the game is a group of friends (the players) go camping together,out in a remote mountain resort.

<p>While the DreadOut development team are continuing to work hard in developing DreadOut toward its final release, the development rate has not been fast enough. For a reference, it took more than a year for DreadOut demo to see the light.</p>
<p>Well, things can be made faster in the process by gaining more resources to support the development. But we unfortunately are financially limited such that simply adding more resources to speed up the development is not feasible.</p>
<p>This is where you can help making difference! You can backing us to speed upon development by donating some amount to your liking.</p>

<p>Although we can't be compared with some AAA titles out there with hundred people, hundred million budget, yet we already invested our energy, time and money for the sake of our love on this game. DreadOut had been developed almost 2 years now, with start with only 2 people we are now expanding our team with almost 5-15 people now. Even we can handle the most expensive parts of the game such as 3D modeling, animating and texturing assets, because most of our internal team has some form of 3D artistry in our work experience, so the need for 3D assets is offset by using internal resources only, and yet we still need more time and more funds to speed up our production. So here's the breakdown of how the additional money will be spent:</p>

Our first original game was Hallway Raid, a game paying tribute to The Raid: Redemption movie. The game was released free and received a positive response from the public but unfortunately we couldn’t continue it due to a licensing issue. it's funny even though we create a free game based on our love on that film, sadly some company complaining to us to takes down that game…:) you can see it how it plays on you tube <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gyxXSnnp_Y"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gyxXSnnp_Y</a></p>

<p><strong><img alt=""faq"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://dreadout.com/images/FAQ.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why </strong><strong>Crowd funding</strong><strong>?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>Dreadout has been in development for almost 2 years now and, besides the limited resources, what makes the development process longer is balancing the production costs with the company cash flow. We have split our team in two: the first team is handling DreadOut and the second team is ensuring the company cash flow remains secure by completing regular client-based animation contract work. With the support of crowdfunding we hope to secure our budget to release DreadOut without depending on the second team’s funding resource. In fact we are planning to merge both teams into one big team to speed up the release.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why </strong><strong>not try to find an investment on VC</strong><strong>?</strong></p>
<p>The computer games industry in our country is still in the early days of development. We are way behind, even when compared to other countries in South East Asia! The investors we spoke with were more comfortable if we created games and apps for mobile platforms. Some prospective investors even tried to change our horror theme which we couldn’t accept due to our belief in this project and the hard work we have already invested. <strong>We Stand it for PC Game! :D</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: Why IndieGoGo?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>We are an Indonesian based company and Kickstarter is not available to us. While KS is widely perceived to be the more influential source for video games funding, we still have faith that we can achieve our modest goal through IndieGoGo just as well.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img alt=""thanks"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://dreadout.com/images/THANK%20YOU.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>By creating DreadOut we hope we can make a good survival horror game for the love of us in that genre, and maybe can inspire our peers across South East Asia, and especially in our home country of Indonesia.  Together we can develop our industry and, of course, the creative industries in general.</p>

Basically helping us to build a bigger and richer world. We can add more ghosts, more animations, more diverse landscapes, more music, engaging animated cut-scenes and much, much, more including free roam options etc.
Allowing us to complete additional work such as translating DreadOut into other languages (1st release will be in dual audio English and Bahasa Indonesia with English subtitles and menus).

The computer games industry in our country is still in the early days of development. We are way behind, even when compared to other countries in South East Asia! The investors we spoke with were more comfortable if we created games and apps for mobile platforms. Some prospective investors even tried to change our horror theme which we couldn’t accept due to our belief in this project and the hard work we have already invested. We Stand it for PC Game! :D
Q: Why IndieGoGo?
A: We are an Indonesian based company and Kickstarter is not available to us. While KS is widely perceived to be the more influential source for video games funding, we still have faith that we can achieve our modest goal through IndieGoGo just as well.


 
By creating DreadOut we hope we can make a good survival horror game for the love of us in that genre, and maybe can inspire our peers across South East Asia, and especially in our home country of Indonesia.  Together we can develop our industry and, of course, the creative industries in general.

<div>The whole purpose of this campaign is to introduce my new ""witty"" card game, <i><b>How Do You Like it?</b></i>. The main premise of this game is to point out a common factor between 2 objects. Whether it is clean or dirty is totally up to you. The game is easy to learn and has an unlimited amount possibilities. Plus, it's portable so you can enjoy the fun at restaurants, bars, house parties, waiting rooms...really anywhere with a table or a floor. There is a more thorough walkthrough of the game below. </div> </div> <div> <h3>How To Play</h3> <p>Like I said this is an easy game to learn and understand, but mastering the game doesn't come easy to everyone. Here is a walkthrough of the game:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Pass 5-7 cards out to everyone (depending on players and time)</li>
<li>Flip one of the cards over to start the game</li>
<li>Go counter clockwise in play</li>
<li>
<i><b>Here's an example:</b></i> (Refer to the picture) I have 5 cards in my hand and <i>Clowns</i> is the card in play. I have to pick one of my cards and announce the comparison between them. For this I would play <i>Leprechauns</i>. I would lay my card down and say ""I like my Clowns like my Leprechauns; small and creepy"". Then the next player will have to play off my <i>Leprechauns</i> card.</li>
<li>Be careful, if everyone thinks your answer doesnt work then you have to pick your card back up and draw 2 other cards as a penalty. To play it safe you can pass, but then you will have to pick a card up. </li>
<li>The object of the game is to run out of cards first. </li>
</ul>
<h3><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""line-height: 30px;""><b>The Goal</b></span></h3>
</div><div> <p>Pretty simple, raise the awareness of <b><i>How Do You Like it?</i></b>. If I can get enough people interested in this game I can start pre ordering everything and keep the price low for everyone. </p>

I'm a passionate player in my local area and have already secured an invitation for Nationals through my local regionals tournament that has happened.</p>
<p>I'm an avid player and have personally helped with the growth of my local scene to draw more players to playing this card game by hosting panels at anime conventions in my local area in order to teach newer players what are the benefits of playing such a game and how to enjoy it.</p>
<p>I would love to end up going to nationals in order to compete with more knowledgeable players, I have previously traveled to Vancouver to compete in one of their local tournaments and it has shown that there are better players out there and that there is room to improve in my personal gameplay.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>Basically, the money you are placing into this funding for my trip will only cover the cost of airfare to the location.</div>

This is a staple of Fighting Games however, so its nothing a seasoned fighting game veteran won't be unfamiliar with.</li></ul><ul><li>Dynamic Wall and Ceiling Combos; Beast's Fury uses a different approach to combos in the corner and at midscreen, in making it so that characters can use dynamic elements of the wall (Where they hit the wall and how hard) as well as if they're launched against the ceiling of a stage, and changing where/how they hit the ground. This changes the typical juggling system in that it makes players reconsider their combo choices depending on the stage.</li></ul><ul><li>Unique Mechanics Per Character; All of the characters in the game have unique abilities and game mechnics that set them apart. Though they follow the simple scheme of 'get the opponent to 0 life', all of them carry unique abilities that allow them to turn the tide of battle. Some prime examples being Vincent's ability to spend Meter in order to cancel his special moves into other special moves, or Don's ability to combo into EX Command Throws.</li></ul><ul><li>Adrenaline and Fury; Characters in Beast's Fury have the ability to store up energy for a Final Round push, giving them a game-ending boost where their natural abilities and unique game mechanics get boosts that make characters' much more powerful for a limited time. The stored energy is Adrenaline, and once per game, characters spend their adrenaline to go into Fury. However, they run out of Adrenaline to fuel their Fury gauge, their character powers down, losing their game changing mechanics and occasionally losing other skills as well.</li></ul><ul><li>Ultimate Finisher; Similar to Instant Kill Attacks in other games, the Ultimate Finisher is a move that is only available in the final round of any normal game. When a player activates their Fury, they have a limited amount of time to land a certain amount of hits on their opponent. If they succeed in landing the required amount, a cinematic finisher plays, and the opponent is instantly defeated, regardless of their remaining health.</li></ul><br/><p></p>

This is a staple of Fighting Games however, so its nothing a seasoned fighting game veteran won't be unfamiliar with.Dynamic Wall and Ceiling Combos; Beast's Fury uses a different approach to combos in the corner and at midscreen, in making it so that characters can use dynamic elements of the wall (Where they hit the wall and how hard) as well as if they're launched against the ceiling of a stage, and changing where/how they hit the ground. This changes the typical juggling system in that it makes players reconsider their combo choices depending on the stage.Unique Mechanics Per Character; All of the characters in the game have unique abilities and game mechnics that set them apart. Though they follow the simple scheme of 'get the opponent to 0 life', all of them carry unique abilities that allow them to turn the tide of battle. Some prime examples being Vincent's ability to spend Meter in order to cancel his special moves into other special moves, or Don's ability to combo into EX Command Throws.Adrenaline and Fury; Characters in Beast's Fury have the ability to store up energy for a Final Round push, giving them a game-ending boost where their natural abilities and unique game mechanics get boosts that make characters' much more powerful for a limited time. The stored energy is Adrenaline, and once per game, characters spend their adrenaline to go into Fury. However, they run out of Adrenaline to fuel their Fury gauge, their character powers down, losing their game changing mechanics and occasionally losing other skills as well.Ultimate Finisher; Similar to Instant Kill Attacks in other games, the Ultimate Finisher is a move that is only available in the final round of any normal game. When a player activates their Fury, they have a limited amount of time to land a certain amount of hits on their opponent. If they succeed in landing the required amount, a cinematic finisher plays, and the opponent is instantly defeated, regardless of their remaining health.",19.0,0,"3 Campaigns

Visits to museums, National Parks, and even World Heritage Sites, will unlock in-game mysteries and increase in-game points. <strong> In the process of playing, gamer's will be providing people with water, food, medicine, shelter; they'll be saving acres of rainforest, protecting endangered species, preserving World Heritage Sites, even defending the night sky!</strong> Gamers who complete all the heroic exploits will earn the badges of the nonprofit organizations, including the badge of the ""Heroic Imagination Project"". The Cyberhero League game portal  is linked to ""Project Milky Way,"" an epic narrative and transmedia adventure. The aim of this first stage of development is to establish an online headquarters that will serve as a gathering place and training ground for cyberheroes. </p>

<h3>Who are we and what do we do?</h3>
By we I mostly mean me, Petter Ljungqvist, although I am getting some help.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I've decided to make a game that I would have liked to play myself, had it only existed. I've set out to combine old-school graphics with an - hopefully - engaging plot, and some clever puzzles.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As I said, this is mostly a solitary endeavour, but not entirely. Music is being made by a certain Nellie Neely, and my life partner Helena is supporting me spiritually, and she's also the model in the recordings I make for the rotoscope animations. The rest is made by yours truly, with plenty of help from the ever so helpful AGS community.</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
Basically what we need money for is proper voice acting. Nothing can ruin a game like a bunch of amateurs who believe they can do voices, so I'm going to consult someone who's at least semi-professional in the field, and for this I need a starting sum.</div>
<p>If you like old-fashioned Point-N-Click adventure games - and frankly, who doesn't - then help us realize this project, so that it can see the light of day before the end of 2013.</p>
<h3>First tell me some more about this ""game"" of yours</h3>
<p>Fair enough. The Samaritan Paradox is set in Sweden in the 80's. Ord Salamon has agreed to help Sara Bergwall find the book her father, Jonatan Bergwall, wrote before he died. During the course of this treasure hunt, he learns that Jonatan was investigating the weapons industry, and more specifically some covert affairs with foreign dictatorships.</p>
<p>But more questions arise. What is the book about, and why does Sara want Ord to find it for her? Did her Alzheimer's-stricken mother know the secret before she grew too demented to share it? And how did Jonatan actually die?</p>
<h3>The progress</h3>
<p>As you can see in the video trailer, we're well into the progress. Rest assured that this game will be released at some point, regardless of your support. Fundings will only make it even better!</p>
<p>This means that claiming a perk should be regarded first and foremost as a pre-order; you'll be guaranteed to obtain the game before normal buyers. </p></div>","Who are we and what do we do?

Remember, keep it concise, yet personal. Ask yourself: if someone stopped reading here would they be ready to make a contribution?   What We Need & What You Get Break it down for folks in more detail: 
Explain how much funding you need and where it's going. Be transparent and specific-people need to trust you to want to fund you.  Tell people about your unique perks. Get them excited! Describe where the funds go if you don't reach your entire goal. 
  The Impact Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know how the difference their contribution will make: 
Explain why your project is valuable to the contributor and to the world. Point out your successful track record with projects like this (if you have one). Make it real for people and build trust. 
  Risks & Challenges  People value your transparency. Be open and stand out by providing insight into the risks and obstacles you may face on the way to achieving your goal. 
Share what qualifies you to overcome these hurdles. Describe your plan for solving these challenges. 
  Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help: 
Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about your campaign. Remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools! 
 And that's all there is to it.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p><b>Think about this</b>: Cancer for College receives hundreds of applications from cancer survivors each year. The charity is only able to grant scholarships to less than 10% of total applicants, meaning there are SO many cancer survivors left unsupported and unable to make their college dreams come true.</p>
<p>What $375,000 equates to on Cancer for College terms are the funds to allocate two full years of scholarships at our current rate of giving.  </p>
<p>That's upward of <b>150 new scholarships for cancer survivors</b>.  </p>

from cancer. Basically, I want to throw one of the coolest video game events in the history of mankind, possibly even dating back to the time of the dinosaurs.LET'S MAKE A DEAL!

host the event on October 26th in San Francisco.

Diego, but stay classy!)Our 2 hour gaming extravaganza will be live broadcast

* Reward Appearances Not Final, some images simulatedVIDEO GAMES CAN HELP?
Alright, enough about the prizes and fun stuff. Prepare  to get your MIND BLOWN.



Yeah, video games aren't just fun for late night binge sessions or weekend tourneys with your gamer clan...games are also used as a form of therapy and help patients significantly during their treatment.




In fact, games have been created with the specific purpose of helping cancer patients battle the disease. Crazy, huh? 




WHY $375,000? THINK ABOUT THIS...

OK OK, you might now be asking what $375,000 means to Cancer for College and DonateGames.org? What will they do with this funding?



Think about this: Cancer for College receives hundreds of applications from cancer survivors each year. The charity is only able to grant scholarships to less than 10% of total applicants, meaning there are SO many cancer survivors left unsupported and unable to make their college dreams come true.
What $375,000 equates to on Cancer for College terms are the funds to allocate two full years of scholarships at our current rate of giving.  
That's upward of 150 new scholarships for cancer survivors.  



WHERE THE MONEY GOES.
Here are the general facts about how your donations will be used:




We're here to help kids with cancer and survivors. 


Proceeds will be directed to nonprofits Cancer for College and DonateGames.org


Funds raised will be used to fund college scholarships for cancer survivors & provide direct financial support to families with children battling cancer 




About Cancer For College: Cancer for College provides hope and inspiration to cancer survivors by granting college scholarships.  Since inception, the charity has granted nearly $2 million in scholarships to more than 1,000 survivors from around the country. Visit www.cancerforcollege.org to learn more.
About DonateGames.org: DonateGames is a charitable organization that leverages video games, technology and innovation to help children and families suffering from cancer. A trusted nonprofit in the video game industry, DonateGames unites a philanthropic purpose with technology, providing gamers with a vehicle to change the world for children with cancer. Learn more at www.donategames.org.


WHY WE ARE HERE AND WHY WE CARE.


With all sincerity, the people in the pictures below are the heroes and why I'm involved with this charitable event....they are the ones who inspire me, and the reason we're all here today!


These are kids battling cancer or survivors who we have helped go to college through our charity, Cancer for College.
A family will use every last resource to return a child to health often leaving nothing for things such as a college education.

<p><strong><strong>(2D) OPEN WORLD.</strong></strong> Players will operate in one sector of the galaxy, Vigrior. They will be given an entire campaign, in an open (quite possibly, endless) map, with unique story driven missions. Players can do any mission, any time, in any area they reach.<strong><br/><br/><strong>RTS/RTT STANDARD ELEMENTS.</strong></strong> We aren't reinventing the wheel on this game, though we are making some small modifications. No more build orders, no structural dependencies, no resource gathering. Map controls and unit controls are about the same, except you will have the capacity for a dynamic range of maneuvers.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/pfPf5.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>COOPERATIVE GAMING. </strong><span>Players will be able to use their local network, or the planetary network, and run up to 4 player games.</span></p>

<p><strong>HORDE ENEMY A.I.</strong><span> Players will encounter enemies that operate as swarms, each enemy also having unique abilities. Players will often be outnumbered, however, in the scope of maneuver warfare, numbers don't account for victory. </span><em>In an open world map, the enemy can come from anywhere, and nowhere.</em></p>
<p><em><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/y77Fx.png"" src="""" style=""""/></em></p>
<p><strong>RECON MISSIONS. </strong><span>Ever seen an RTS / RTT game have fun side quests? You'll get locked areas where you will guide a fleet on a fixed flight path. Your task will be to survive, evade, and cloak.</span></p>

<p><span><strong><br/></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>MISSION AND MANEUVERING DATA. </strong><span>Players will be able to save their current state in Vigrior (assuming they have cleared all combat encounters), as well as save their fleet maneuvering data. These files will be easy to mod, and share all over the web. Players will also be able to record their ansible transmissions to video files.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>FLEET UPGRADES.  </strong><span>Players will be upgrading their fleets; adding new ships and increasing the rate of their ships maneuverability. </span><em>They will also be able to deploy multiple fleets at once, if they have earned their stripes.</em></p>

<p><strong>BOSS FLEETS.  </strong>We'll let you simmer on what that implies. We don't intend to create ""boss characters"" that are overdone. Instead, we will be creating unique enemy fleets, with very precise maneuvers. It is up to you to study how to defeat these Viral anomalies.</p>

FleetCOMM : Operation Vigrior is an open world strategy game. Players will be thrust into one section of the galaxy, running missions, combat scenarios, reconnaissance and saving human colonies.
Fleet Command and Control. Players will be given a fleet ansible. This tool is capable of creating, saving and executing complex combat maneuvers. The player can execute their own designs with one trigger. This tool eliminates the need to ramp up a players interface skill, while giving the player visual feedback in a real time combat environment. Players can focus on strategy and maneuvers, instead of clicking speed.  

CORE GAME MECHANICS

(2D) OPEN WORLD. Players will operate in one sector of the galaxy, Vigrior. They will be given an entire campaign, in an open (quite possibly, endless) map, with unique story driven missions. Players can do any mission, any time, in any area they reach.RTS/RTT STANDARD ELEMENTS. We aren't reinventing the wheel on this game, though we are making some small modifications. No more build orders, no structural dependencies, no resource gathering. Map controls and unit controls are about the same, except you will have the capacity for a dynamic range of maneuvers.

COOPERATIVE GAMING. Players will be able to use their local network, or the planetary network, and run up to 4 player games.

HORDE ENEMY A.I. Players will encounter enemies that operate as swarms, each enemy also having unique abilities. Players will often be outnumbered, however, in the scope of maneuver warfare, numbers don't account for victory. In an open world map, the enemy can come from anywhere, and nowhere.

RECON MISSIONS. Ever seen an RTS / RTT game have fun side quests? You'll get locked areas where you will guide a fleet on a fixed flight path. Your task will be to survive, evade, and cloak.


MISSION AND MANEUVERING DATA. Players will be able to save their current state in Vigrior (assuming they have cleared all combat encounters), as well as save their fleet maneuvering data. These files will be easy to mod, and share all over the web. Players will also be able to record their ansible transmissions to video files.
FLEET UPGRADES.  Players will be upgrading their fleets; adding new ships and increasing the rate of their ships maneuverability. They will also be able to deploy multiple fleets at once, if they have earned their stripes.

BOSS FLEETS.  We'll let you simmer on what that implies. We don't intend to create ""boss characters"" that are overdone. Instead, we will be creating unique enemy fleets, with very precise maneuvers. It is up to you to study how to defeat these Viral anomalies.

<div>
<p>Hi everyone, my name is Peter, and I think the best way to introduce ourselves is to show you the teaser of our game:</p>
<h3>
<a href=""http://youtu.be/DFHRlmeG_vE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Strike Zombies Teaser</a> </h3>
<p>I'm the founder of our <strong>small, but ambitious team from Hungary</strong> called: <strong>Sharpbyte</strong>. As of now, the team has 3 members (plus a few freelancers help us out occasionally), working on the same thing; we want to <strong>create our first own commercial videogame: <em>Strike Zombies. </em></strong>(Which is actually going to be<em style=""font-weight: bold;""> available for</em><strong> free</strong>,<strong></strong> so commercial rather refers to the quality of the final product this time<strong><em> ...</em></strong>)</p>
<p>We have already made significant progress, but as we are edging closer to actually finishing the game, it is also <strong>getting a lot harder</strong> because of mostly two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Simply put: <strong>we don't have the proper tools for the job</strong> - (We'll get back to that...)</p>
</li>
<li>
<em><strong>Microfunding for small startups</strong> <strong>is</strong></em> pretty much <em><strong>non-existent</strong> around here</em>, leading to a loss of talent, forcing young guys to work in areas they're not even good at... <strong>WE WANT TO CHANGE THAT!</strong> </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>That's the <strong>main reason </strong>why <strong>we turned to crowdfunding</strong>... </h3>
<p>We would like to make our products, our work as affordable and accessible to most everybody as possible, so we decided to publish our first game – <strong>Strike Zombies</strong> – for free, but in order to do that, we are going to need some help from you guys. <strong>Via crowdfunding, people can:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>influence the market directly</strong>, by a vote of confidence, coming from their wallets, thus deciding what’s worth creating and what’s not,</li>
<li>help <strong>providers</strong> like us <strong>give back more</strong>, special bonuses, perks, benefits, an extra „bang for their buck”,</li>
<li>
<strong>lower</strong> our <strong>costs of marketing</strong> by being active in social media, allowing us to use these spared funds to enhance our product greatly,</li>
<li>(most importantly in my opinion...) give <strong>startups enough funding to get proper tools!</strong> There are so many talented youngsters out there, with great plans they’re unable to present, because of their ancient computers, phones, etc...</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>3000$ USD for software &amp; hardware</h3>
<p>Right now our team's fastest desktop PC is an old single-core P4 with 512 Mb RAM - <strong>99% of the work</strong> you see here or at our <a href=""http://sharpbyte.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""website"">website</a> (facebook, youtube, twitter, etc...), was done on that particular machine. Believe me when I say: <strong>It's SLOOOOOOOOOOWWW! </strong>:) We could cut the time needed to finish the game in half (at least), and still increase the quality of the game in the meantime.</p>
<p>As you may have guessed, we don't have better equipment on other fronts either, I'm actually still using a ""dumbphone"" for example, which makes life kinda hard for an Android developer... :)</p>
<p><strong>So we need your help!</strong></p>
<p>Licencing useful software - like the Adobe CS package or a sequencer like FL Studio - would also decrease the development time by a lot! So you are basically buying us time with your contribution!</p>
<h3>About the game itself:</h3>
<p>Almost 2 years ago, I was thinking about a <strong>simple control method</strong> concept, something I haven’t seen in a game before.  The basic idea was that I drew 2 diagonal lines on a smartphone’s screen with my finger, and then a completely vertical line shot out from the intersection of the diagonal lines, hitting (or missing) the target below... I knew I could use this for controlling a targetting system, a defense mechanism for something that shoots from either up or down. It seemed to me that the perfect system to test if it produces a fun gameplay, was a <strong>lightning generator</strong>.</p>
<p>From here it was kinda straightforfard, that it’s going to be <strong>an action/tower defense hybrid</strong>, and the coming waves of attackers just had to be <strong>zombies</strong>. (I mean, just think about it, a screaming, attacking zombie approaches you or someone you love, is really closing in a hurry... Then suddenly a lightning bolt just smashes the zombie, out of nowhere, with a huge bang of thunder, ripping it to pieces... Hmm, sounds like a fun game...) </p>
<p>This concept has come a long way since then, and we decided to start giving you <strong>details, artwork,  screenshots, teasers, and - in a few days - a working prototype! </strong>We already have plenty to show, so hop along, and enjoy the ride as we present you: <strong>Strike Zombies</strong>!</p>
<p>The game will come to <strong>Windows &amp; Android</strong> first, but we plan to port it to multiple platforms, like <strong>IOS</strong> for example. The full game will be <strong>completely free to download &amp; play</strong>, although the free version will have a few ads in the menu section – no ads during gameplay though!!!</p>
<p>We already have a simplified, working prototype made with the Game Maker engine, using custom scripts, gfx and music, but we plan to put a few more features in it before we show this demo to you. Until then, check out our <strong>new teaser (</strong><em>at the top of the page)</em>! (By the way, a few words about our ideas, about our work in the comments section can really light up our day - or give us new ideas -, so don't hold back! Thanks!)</p>
<p>There are going to be <strong>very frequent update</strong>s, so check back often!</p>
<p>I also encourage you to <strong>follow our social media</strong> related <strong>portals</strong> on <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/SharpByte"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Facebook</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=""https://twitter.com/sharpbytedotorg"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Twitter</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/sharpbytedotorg"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Youtube</strong></a>. Hopefully you’ll find plenty of stuff that makes you want to click on those „<em>thumbs up</em>” buttons, maybe even <strong>share</strong> something, and become a part of helping <strong>Sharpbyte</strong> live up to these great promises.</p>

<p>Hello! My name is Graeme and i'm looking to kickstart my own charity: Gaming for Parkinsons. To raise money for the victims and families that are affected by the disease.

<p>I am one of the many who know someone that was taken by this highly treatable virus. My grandfather passed away in December 2013 at the age of 70 due to an infection that was accelerated and amplified by Parkinsons. </p>

<p>To raise awareness, as the name suggests will be through gaming.

The streams will be an almost constant event but as most of us have other commitment like work and families ect. The channels will be divided and events will be broadcasted within those channels.</p>

<p><strong>How can you help and what does this kickstarter fund?</strong></p>
<p>As the intro described - This is a kickstarter and not a charitable cause at this moment in time. The proceeds will aim towards starting the foundation of this charity in terms of equipment and other resources. </p>
<p>Commiting to this cause and donating will basically make all of our wishes come true and help us commit to this project. Possibly to the point where it can become a constant stream of dedicated players who are looking to raise money for this charitable cause. </p>
<p>We are 100% commited to this cause and aim to please all of our viewers with regular competitons - perks and promotions.</p>
<p><strong>What is in it for you?</strong></p>
<p>This is a charitible cause and all proceeds will be replicated where available to the charity. Your contributions will not be wasted on the foundations as we aim to increase this tenfold and put it back into the charity. At this point we are still in talk with corporate sponsors with the possibilty of merchanise which we will send to our most valued contributors (Design not available at this time). </p>
<p>What we will do is create our own website where all contributors will be added to the starred hall of fame. This will range from £5-10 donations. For those who maybe cannot donate as much, you will receive a massive hug from ourselves and a thank you for your help. You are awesome. </p>
<p><strong>Game over.</strong></p>
<p>From myself and everyone here at Gaming for Parkinsons we would like to extend our deepest thanks to those who do choose to donate to this cause and assist us with making this a reality.

Hello! My name is Graeme and i'm looking to kickstart my own charity: Gaming for Parkinsons. To raise money for the victims and families that are affected by the disease. Parkinsons does not take lives directly but the symptoms do. People suffering from this disease will live with a lot of dicomfort until the very end.
I am one of the many who know someone that was taken by this highly treatable virus. My grandfather passed away in December 2013 at the age of 70 due to an infection that was accelerated and amplified by Parkinsons. 
Sitting here in my room I asked myself the one simple question: ""What can I do to help those in my situation?""
My solution is Gaming for Parkinsons.
How will we raise awareness?
To raise awareness, as the name suggests will be through gaming. We are looking to set up 12 - 24 hour streaming sessions in which the viewer has the option / ability to make small to large donations based on level of involvement.

The games in which we will stream will differ depending on the streamer. But the games will be current and up to the highest of standards. 
Twitch TV will be our main medium as this has the largest viewer base and easiest accessability. 
How can you help and what does this kickstarter fund?
As the intro described - This is a kickstarter and not a charitable cause at this moment in time. The proceeds will aim towards starting the foundation of this charity in terms of equipment and other resources. 
Commiting to this cause and donating will basically make all of our wishes come true and help us commit to this project. Possibly to the point where it can become a constant stream of dedicated players who are looking to raise money for this charitable cause. 
We are 100% commited to this cause and aim to please all of our viewers with regular competitons - perks and promotions.
What is in it for you?
This is a charitible cause and all proceeds will be replicated where available to the charity. Your contributions will not be wasted on the foundations as we aim to increase this tenfold and put it back into the charity. At this point we are still in talk with corporate sponsors with the possibilty of merchanise which we will send to our most valued contributors (Design not available at this time).

<p>Welcome, and thanks for checking out our Indiegogo campaign! You're probably asking yourself, ""What is Project: Rhea anyway?"" Well, in a nutshell, it is a new type of gaming concept. Think ""cyberpunk meets a new world."" A truly unique RPG/FPS MMO sandbox hybrid, the likes of which the world has never seen. At least we like to think so. We believe that most gamers have a list of favorite features from each game they play, but wish they all existed in the same game. Our own ""favorites list"" forms the basis for Project: Rhea, and will be added to and/or modified based on what you want. You will find a tentative feature list below.</p>
<h1><strong>WE WANT YOUR IDEAS:</strong></h1>
<p>A big part of the design process for this MMO will be the interaction and feedback from you, the potential player base, on what should go into the game. A special area will be set up on the Rhea forums: <a href=""http://www.project-rhea.com/forum"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.project-rhea.com/forum</a>, where we will follow a collaborative process via discussions and polls between our team and all of you. We want to hear from you. Tell us what you like in an MMO. Tell us what you don't like. Describe the makings of the dream game you have always wished for. We need and welcome your input!</p>
<h1><strong>OUR CORE FEATURE FOCUS POINTS:</strong></h1>
<p>In creating this game, we are focusing our energies on a certain ""core"" list of concepts. Everything else will form around these:</p>
<p>- <em><strong>Open-ended, sandbox-style gameplay:</strong></em> giving players unprecedented freedom to forge their own path, while still possessing an engaging underlying storyline to drive things in the background.</p>
<p>""Sandbox"" Video - Coming soon...</p>
<p><strong>- <em>Player-created content on a grand scale:</em></strong> The ability to construct just about anything you can imagine. This will be possible through an extensive and innovative crafting system, including recombination of raw materials, creation of components, researching/blueprinting, all fully physics-based, coupled with the ability to harvest almost any type of resource. Want to build a table, do it. Want to build a 6-wheel rover, do it. The possibilities are virtually endless.</p>
<p>""Player-Created Content"" Video - Coming soon...</p>
<p><strong><em>- Player-created settlements:</em></strong> Refer to the previous point regarding content. Create your own shelter. Gather a group of people/resources/skills, and upgrade to a town. Eventually upgrade to a fortress/city. Populate it with people's homes, shops, repair facilities, you name it. Build an army of drones to defend it. Etc...</p>
<p>""Building Your World"" Video - Coming soon...</p>
<p><em><strong>- Earned skills in lieu of traditional skill trees and automatic skill granting:</strong> </em>Forget about going to an NPC who magically ""grants"" you the ability to do something. In Project Rhea, just go out and do it. The more you perform a skill, the better you will get at it.</p>
<p>""Earned Skills"" Video - Coming soon...</p>
<p><em><strong>- Hybrid mission system:</strong> </em>Procedurally generated missions based on the current environment, economy, politics, and resource availability of a particular region. Gone are the days of ""kill x number of giant spiders - receive a trinket"". Also, there will be a system in place for players to generate missions. These missions will also take into account the current stats of the player creating them and can be for any number of purposes. Some examples are job requisitions, paid construction, crafting, defense, paid mercenary, etc...</p>
<p>""Missions"" Video: <a href=""http://youtu.be/IKRX7g7KRME"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Project Rhea - Missions"">http://youtu.be/IKRX7g7KRME</a></p>
<p><strong><em>- Advanced NPC/mob AI:</em></strong> Things like working as a group, roaming, tactical maneuvers, learning about players actions, inter-NPC communication, etc...</p>
<p>""AI"" Video - Coming soon...</p>
<p><em><strong>- A fully dynamic, persistent, and regenerative world:</strong></em> Conservation of resources, which change form, grow, decompose into other materials, etc..., but do not just ""disappear"" from the world-state balance.</p>
<p>""The World of Project Rhea"" Video: Coming soon...</p>
<p><strong><em>- Multiple ""planes"" of simulation:</em></strong> Everything from underground, ground-level, oceans, atmosphere, and space travel will be simulated. In effect, the game will exist in a virtual solar system.</p>
<p>""Simulation In A Nutshell"" Video: Coming soon...</p>
<p><strong><em>- And much more...</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Read on below if you are interested...</strong></p>
<h1><strong>BACKSTORY:</strong></h1>
<p>It is the distant future, and mankind is at a crossroads. The situation is desperate. Global climate change has, over many hundreds of years, taken a terrible toll on the planet. Places which were once teeming with life, are now either perpetual deserts, or barren frozen wastelands. Several world-wars, depletion of natural resources, and over-population have made Earth a hostile, uninhabitable place.

<h1>OUR QUALIFICATIONS:</h1>
<p>We are a small team of talented and experienced developers who collectively have the skills to make an MMO such as what we propose, a reality. That being said, we are actively working to grow the team a bit, in order to ensure the best possibly experience for our user base.</p>
<h1>THANK YOU IN ADVANCE!</h1>
<p>If you have any questions, please ask. We'd love to here from you.</p></div>","WHAT WE ARE ALL ABOUT:
Welcome, and thanks for checking out our Indiegogo campaign! You're probably asking yourself, ""What is Project: Rhea anyway?"" Well, in a nutshell, it is a new type of gaming concept. Think ""cyberpunk meets a new world."" A truly unique RPG/FPS MMO sandbox hybrid, the likes of which the world has never seen. At least we like to think so. We believe that most gamers have a list of favorite features from each game they play, but wish they all existed in the same game. Our own ""favorites list"" forms the basis for Project: Rhea, and will be added to and/or modified based on what you want. You will find a tentative feature list below.
WE WANT YOUR IDEAS:
A big part of the design process for this MMO will be the interaction and feedback from you, the potential player base, on what should go into the game. A special area will be set up on the Rhea forums: www.project-rhea.com/forum, where we will follow a collaborative process via discussions and polls between our team and all of you. We want to hear from you. Tell us what you like in an MMO. Tell us what you don't like. Describe the makings of the dream game you have always wished for. We need and welcome your input!
OUR CORE FEATURE FOCUS POINTS:
In creating this game, we are focusing our energies on a certain ""core"" list of concepts. Everything else will form around these:
- Open-ended, sandbox-style gameplay: giving players unprecedented freedom to forge their own path, while still possessing an engaging underlying storyline to drive things in the background.
""Sandbox"" Video - Coming soon...
- Player-created content on a grand scale: The ability to construct just about anything you can imagine. This will be possible through an extensive and innovative crafting system, including recombination of raw materials, creation of components, researching/blueprinting, all fully physics-based, coupled with the ability to harvest almost any type of resource. Want to build a table, do it. Want to build a 6-wheel rover, do it. The possibilities are virtually endless.
""Player-Created Content"" Video - Coming soon...
- Player-created settlements: Refer to the previous point regarding content. Create your own shelter. Gather a group of people/resources/skills, and upgrade to a town. Eventually upgrade to a fortress/city. Populate it with people's homes, shops, repair facilities, you name it. Build an army of drones to defend it. Etc...
""Building Your World"" Video - Coming soon...
- Earned skills in lieu of traditional skill trees and automatic skill granting: Forget about going to an NPC who magically ""grants"" you the ability to do something. In Project Rhea, just go out and do it. The more you perform a skill, the better you will get at it.
""Earned Skills"" Video - Coming soon...
- Hybrid mission system: Procedurally generated missions based on the current environment, economy, politics, and resource availability of a particular region. Gone are the days of ""kill x number of giant spiders - receive a trinket"". Also, there will be a system in place for players to generate missions. These missions will also take into account the current stats of the player creating them and can be for any number of purposes. Some examples are job requisitions, paid construction, crafting, defense, paid mercenary, etc...
""Missions"" Video: http://youtu.be/IKRX7g7KRME
- Advanced NPC/mob AI: Things like working as a group, roaming, tactical maneuvers, learning about players actions, inter-NPC communication, etc...
""AI"" Video - Coming soon...
- A fully dynamic, persistent, and regenerative world: Conservation of resources, which change form, grow, decompose into other materials, etc..., but do not just ""disappear"" from the world-state balance.
""The World of Project Rhea"" Video: Coming soon...
- Multiple ""planes"" of simulation: Everything from underground, ground-level, oceans, atmosphere, and space travel will be simulated. In effect, the game will exist in a virtual solar system.
""Simulation In A Nutshell"" Video: Coming soon...
- And much more...
Read on below if you are interested...
BACKSTORY:
It is the distant future, and mankind is at a crossroads. The situation is desperate. Global climate change has, over many hundreds of years, taken a terrible toll on the planet. Places which were once teeming with life, are now either perpetual deserts, or barren frozen wastelands. Several world-wars, depletion of natural resources, and over-population have made Earth a hostile, uninhabitable place. Our home is no longer fit to sustain us, and we must search out a new place to live. ""Per aspera, ad astra"", through hardships to the stars.
(note: the images below are just concept art, and do not necessarily reflect anything that will be in the actual game)

Fortunately for us, the world's continually declining condition and eventual plight was forecasted by visionary individuals from the scientific community two centuries ago. At that time, plans were put into motion to save us all from our inevitable future fate.

The governments of several world powers formed a top-secret collaborative alliance, and initiated work on the ultimate global survival contingency plan, code-named: ""PROJECT: Rhea"".Rhea's ultimate goal is to ensure the survival of the human race after the Earth is no longer capable of sustaining life as we know it.
The three main tenants of Rhea are:
1. Provide for long-term travel through inter-stellar space for large numbers of people.
 2. Develop technologies which will enable personal survival on other planets.
 3. Create tools and infrastructure to promote the creation and the sustainment of new civilizations on other planets.

As time progressed, several gigantic starships, called ""Arks"" were built in space-docks orbiting Earth.
Each ark is fully automated and self-maintaining, with all human passengers and crew in hyper-extended cryogenic suspended animation. Pointed at a destination star system, they travel at FTL (faster than light) speed.

Upon nearing their destination, the ships begin to revive their crew, who then conduct an exploratory mission to search for a habitable planet. If unsuccessful, the ship is put back into automatic control and the crew to ""sleep"" until the next system is reached.

IN-GAME STARTING POINT:
The arks eventually reach the Epsilon Eridani star system, a long studied location thought to harbor planets capable of sustaining life. A thorough off-world scan reveals that this is true.
It is discovered that during the journey, several of the arks were lost, with the cause being largely unknown. There are some fragmented clues recorded by the computers of the remaining arks, but nothing as yet conclusive.
The satellite known as Epsilon Eridani B, now renamed Rhea Prime, is selected as the first planet to attempt habitation.

The orders to start the disembark are issued, and the first group of passengers are given the green light to head to the surface. Each new Rhean, is given a personal shuttle to get them to the surface of the planet, stocked with the tools to enable them to survive in the new frontier they will find themselves in upon landing.

Once you step onto the planet, you are on your own. You must build your destiny in the new world. Forge alliances, wage wars, build great things, make a living constructing valuable tools, become a real-estate mogul, become a solitary rogue, take up politics, build a band of space bandits and wander the star system. Not even the sky is the limit!

<p lang=""en-US"" style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">You play as one of the crew members, a spaceship pilot by the name of Moro. In order to keep yourself and others alive you'll have no choice but to explore this hostile place, uncovering its history and solving its dark mysteries.

Don't worry, it won't be annoying to use because we provide a highlight system that marks the places you can examine and interact with.

What is (un)Lucky7?
If we were to describe it with the fewest words possible it would be a ""horror, sci-fi themed, jRPG-view, story-driven, pixelart puzzle game"" – read on if this intrigued or confused you, we will explain it in more detail.

This doesn't last long, though. Upon arriving on an alien planet they find an entrance to a strange base, seemingly lifeless and abandoned. Soon, they are trapped inside, forced to fight for their life and searching for a way back home.
 
You play as one of the crew members, a spaceship pilot by the name of Moro. In order to keep yourself and others alive you'll have no choice but to explore this hostile place, uncovering its history and solving its dark mysteries. All the while developing and maintaining different relations with the rest of the crew (many of which depend on your actions).
 
The game is inspired by titles like To the Moon, Corpse Party and Ao Oni, as well as classic point and click adventure games and sci-fi horror movies from the '80s and '90s. Thus, unsurprisingly, we want to focus on telling a great story with a lot of unexpected twists, unique characters and relations between them. And of course quite a few good scares.
 
This brings us to the horror aspect. It may seem hard to make a scary game in this visual style, but we strive to deliver you a quality scare by developing many elaborate ways to frighten you instead of simply concentrating on cheap jumpscares.

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><em>ICE Project</em> est un FPS coopératif en ligne orienté sandbox sur PC se situant dans un univers de <em>science-fiction</em>. Il propose aux joueurs divers mécanismes simples et innovants pour permettre une interaction sociale, compétitive et conviviale aux joueurs.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Jeune studio indépendant basé à Nice, <em>Ve-Game</em> est composé d'une équipe de 8 personnes<br/>passionnées par le jeu vidéo. L'objectif est de lancer les pré-ventes du jeu en 2013 pour<br/>permettre à la communauté de tester le jeu très tôt et de disposer d'un contenu évolutif.</p>

<div class=""spoiler"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><em>Nous sommes en 2147. Sur Terre, un gouvernement mondial autoritaire règne sur les hommes, concentrés dans d'immenses mégapôles sous haute surveillance. Mais ces derniers mois, la situation a empiré, en effet un rapport de l'O.M.S déclare l'apparition d'un parasite végétal d'origine inconnue sur la planète bleue qui provoquerait des conséquences graves pour la santé.</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><em>Suite à une infection particulièrement violente, l'état d'urgence est déclaré et une corporation d'entreprises lance le projet ICE (Innovation Comfort Ethics) visant à concevoir et envoyer une flotte de vaisseaux pour coloniser une nouvelle planète viable et habitable.</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><em>Des places et même des vaisseaux entiers sont mis en vente à chaque personne ayant les moyens pour commencer une nouvelle vie loin de la Terre.</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><em>Séparé de vos proches et de vos biens en échange d'un ticket pour l'espace, fuyant une atmosphère inquiétante et dangereuse, c'est un nouveau départ pour vous. Dans ce vaisseau, en compagnie d'un groupe de personnes qui seront dorénavant vos compagnons de survie, vous allez devoir vous entraider pour apprivoiser ce nouvel environnement, survivre face à l'inconnu et faire prospérer votre colonie.</em></p>

<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>L'aspect sandbox :</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><em>Présentation :</em></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Fraîchement débarqué sur cette planète luxuriante, livré à vous-même, vous allez devoir évoluer en groupe progressivement et essayer d'atteindre le but principal de l'aspect sandbox : construire la <em>colonie</em> la plus efficace possible pour survivre dans les meilleures conditions.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Une multitude d'outils sont mis entre les mains du joueur et de la colonie dans sa globalité pour vous permettre de réaliser cet objectif mais la voie pour y arriver ne dépend que de votre <em>imagination</em> et de votre <em>créativité</em> !</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Serez-vous un explorateur partant braver les dangers du monde pour percer les secrets de la planète ? Un artisan décidé à aider ses compagnons en créant diverses armes et outils ? Un politicien voulant faire prospérer la ville par sa main ? Un économiste souhaitant imposer sa colonie comme productrice principale de minerais pour la planète entière ? Un architecte chargé de la construction des bâtiments ? Ou même un paria vivant à l'écart de la société pour évoluer seul ?</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Tout ces rôles et bien d'autres sont possibles, vous êtes maître de votre destin et de celui de votre colonie, mais sachez que vous n'êtes pas seuls sur la planète et que vous êtes en lien direct avec les autres, la compétition peut être rude, quelle stratégie adopterez-vous pour le futur ? <em>C'est à vous de décider...</em></p>

<p><strong><em>Système de colonie :</em></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Dans <em>ICE Project</em>, il existe deux sortes de colonies (représentant en réalité un serveur à part entière) qui oeuvrent pour l'expansion de leur territoire. Chaque serveur peut contenir un maximum de 50 personnes hormis les PNJ.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">La première est une colonie <em>""privée""</em> pouvant être fondée par un joueur, une structure, une communauté, etc... Et qui vous appartient totalement, vous pouvez donc partir à l'aventure avec votre cercle d'amis ou même avec la communauté de votre forum préféré !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">La seconde est une colonie <em>""publique""</em> fondée par la corporation ICE et qui permet à un joueur seul de prendre part à l'aventure avec des inconnus.</p>

<p><strong><em>Frises de développement :</em></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Avec <em>ICE Project</em>, nous avons mis en place un système de frises pour suivre l'évolution de la colonie et du joueur. Vos progressions personnelles et collectives sont donc répertoriées grâce à ces frises chronologiques qui permettent de développer de nouveaux attributs et talents.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Pour la colonie, il existe deux frises : <em>""Politique""</em> et <em>""Technologique""</em>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Quand au joueur, il dispose d'une seule frise : <em>""Développement personnel""</em>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Ces trois frises notent les choix et l'évolution dans le temps de la colonie et du joueur, elles permettent de développer des talents ainsi que de débloquer de nouveaux outils et options de développement.</p>

<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>L'aspect e-sport :</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><em>Présentation :</em></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Nous avons un objectif ambitieux avec <em>ICE Project</em>, c'est de percer dans le domaine du sport électronique, également appelé <em>e-sport</em>. Pour cela, nous nous consacrons énormément à travailler sur du contenu compétitif qui puisse réunir un large public et ne pas se retrouver bloqué dans une sphère élitiste. Alors comment cet aspect s'articule-t-il ?</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Au centre de chaque colonie, il y a une <em>arène</em>. Cette arène est accessible par tous et pour tous, il n'y a pas besoin d'accomplir quoi que ce soit pour y avoir accès. Les joueurs voulant se consacrer exclusivement à l'e-sport le peuvent, et les curieux n'étant pas forcément intéressés au premier abord peuvent tout de même venir facilement observer ce qu'il s'y passe.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Dans cette arène, des matchs courts à durée déterminée se déroulent et permettent de faire s'affronter deux équipes dans divers modes de jeu.</p>
<p><img alt=""robot.jpg"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.ve-game.com/images/robot-pnj.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 500px; height: 281px; border-width: 5px; margin: 50px 40px;""/></p>
<p><strong><em>Modes de jeu :</em></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Il y a plusieurs facettes qui permettent de satisfaire chaque type de joueurs : des modes <em>fun et conviviaux</em> pour s'entraîner et s'amuser et un seul mode de jeu <em>taillé, équilibré et pensé pour l'e-sport</em> qui permettra aux équipes ayant l'esprit de compétition de se mesurer à des adversaires à leur niveau.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Ce mode compétitif se déroulera comme suit : une carte de taille moyenne avec deux équipes de cinq personnes face à face et un objectif commun au centre.</p>

Le projet :
ICE Project est un FPS coopératif en ligne orienté sandbox sur PC se situant dans un univers de science-fiction. Il propose aux joueurs divers mécanismes simples et innovants pour permettre une interaction sociale, compétitive et conviviale aux joueurs.
Jeune studio indépendant basé à Nice, Ve-Game est composé d'une équipe de 8 personnespassionnées par le jeu vidéo. L'objectif est de lancer les pré-ventes du jeu en 2013 pourpermettre à la communauté de tester le jeu très tôt et de disposer d'un contenu évolutif.

Histoire :

Nous sommes en 2147. Sur Terre, un gouvernement mondial autoritaire règne sur les hommes, concentrés dans d'immenses mégapôles sous haute surveillance. Mais ces derniers mois, la situation a empiré, en effet un rapport de l'O.M.S déclare l'apparition d'un parasite végétal d'origine inconnue sur la planète bleue qui provoquerait des conséquences graves pour la santé.
Suite à une infection particulièrement violente, l'état d'urgence est déclaré et une corporation d'entreprises lance le projet ICE (Innovation Comfort Ethics) visant à concevoir et envoyer une flotte de vaisseaux pour coloniser une nouvelle planète viable et habitable.
Des places et même des vaisseaux entiers sont mis en vente à chaque personne ayant les moyens pour commencer une nouvelle vie loin de la Terre.
Séparé de vos proches et de vos biens en échange d'un ticket pour l'espace, fuyant une atmosphère inquiétante et dangereuse, c'est un nouveau départ pour vous. Dans ce vaisseau, en compagnie d'un groupe de personnes qui seront dorénavant vos compagnons de survie, vous allez devoir vous entraider pour apprivoiser ce nouvel environnement, survivre face à l'inconnu et faire prospérer votre colonie.


L'aspect sandbox :
Présentation :
Fraîchement débarqué sur cette planète luxuriante, livré à vous-même, vous allez devoir évoluer en groupe progressivement et essayer d'atteindre le but principal de l'aspect sandbox : construire la colonie la plus efficace possible pour survivre dans les meilleures conditions.
Une multitude d'outils sont mis entre les mains du joueur et de la colonie dans sa globalité pour vous permettre de réaliser cet objectif mais la voie pour y arriver ne dépend que de votre imagination et de votre créativité !
Serez-vous un explorateur partant braver les dangers du monde pour percer les secrets de la planète ? Un artisan décidé à aider ses compagnons en créant diverses armes et outils ? Un politicien voulant faire prospérer la ville par sa main ? Un économiste souhaitant imposer sa colonie comme productrice principale de minerais pour la planète entière ? Un architecte chargé de la construction des bâtiments ? Ou même un paria vivant à l'écart de la société pour évoluer seul ?
Tout ces rôles et bien d'autres sont possibles, vous êtes maître de votre destin et de celui de votre colonie, mais sachez que vous n'êtes pas seuls sur la planète et que vous êtes en lien direct avec les autres, la compétition peut être rude, quelle stratégie adopterez-vous pour le futur ? C'est à vous de décider...

Système de colonie :
Dans ICE Project, il existe deux sortes de colonies (représentant en réalité un serveur à part entière) qui oeuvrent pour l'expansion de leur territoire. Chaque serveur peut contenir un maximum de 50 personnes hormis les PNJ.


La première est une colonie ""privée"" pouvant être fondée par un joueur, une structure, une communauté, etc... Et qui vous appartient totalement, vous pouvez donc partir à l'aventure avec votre cercle d'amis ou même avec la communauté de votre forum préféré !


La seconde est une colonie ""publique"" fondée par la corporation ICE et qui permet à un joueur seul de prendre part à l'aventure avec des inconnus.


Frises de développement :
Avec ICE Project, nous avons mis en place un système de frises pour suivre l'évolution de la colonie et du joueur. Vos progressions personnelles et collectives sont donc répertoriées grâce à ces frises chronologiques qui permettent de développer de nouveaux attributs et talents.
Pour la colonie, il existe deux frises : ""Politique"" et ""Technologique"".
Quand au joueur, il dispose d'une seule frise : ""Développement personnel"".
Ces trois frises notent les choix et l'évolution dans le temps de la colonie et du joueur, elles permettent de développer des talents ainsi que de débloquer de nouveaux outils et options de développement.

L'aspect e-sport :
Présentation :
Nous avons un objectif ambitieux avec ICE Project, c'est de percer dans le domaine du sport électronique, également appelé e-sport. Pour cela, nous nous consacrons énormément à travailler sur du contenu compétitif qui puisse réunir un large public et ne pas se retrouver bloqué dans une sphère élitiste. Alors comment cet aspect s'articule-t-il ?
Au centre de chaque colonie, il y a une arène. Cette arène est accessible par tous et pour tous, il n'y a pas besoin d'accomplir quoi que ce soit pour y avoir accès. Les joueurs voulant se consacrer exclusivement à l'e-sport le peuvent, et les curieux n'étant pas forcément intéressés au premier abord peuvent tout de même venir facilement observer ce qu'il s'y passe.
Dans cette arène, des matchs courts à durée déterminée se déroulent et permettent de faire s'affronter deux équipes dans divers modes de jeu.

Modes de jeu :
Il y a plusieurs facettes qui permettent de satisfaire chaque type de joueurs : des modes fun et conviviaux pour s'entraîner et s'amuser et un seul mode de jeu taillé, équilibré et pensé pour l'e-sport qui permettra aux équipes ayant l'esprit de compétition de se mesurer à des adversaires à leur niveau.
Ce mode compétitif se déroulera comme suit : une carte de taille moyenne avec deux équipes de cinq personnes face à face et un objectif commun au centre.
Il faudra atteindre cet objectif avant l'équipe adverse et le défendre pour permettre l'apparition d'un drapeau au point de départ qu'il faudra aller chercher et ramener au centre.

Un mode simple mais efficace, avec les avantages suivants : il permet grâce à sa simplicité en surface et sa lisibilité de réunir un large public de spectateurs et de part sa complexité au niveau des mécaniques de gameplay d'attirer un éventail de joueurs intéressés par l'e-sport.
Rôles :
Chacun des cinq joueurs aura un rôle en particulier dans l'équipe : Attaquant/Défenseur/Runner (il peut donc y avoir plusieurs attaquants ou défenseurs par exemple) et chacun aura des outils pour atteindre l'objectif et empêcher l'équipe adverse d'y arriver avant eux.

Compétition :
Notre ambition étant de démocratiser cette discipline à un cercle plus large qu'il ne l'est actuellement, il nous semble obligatoire de proposer des outils pour les structures, partenaires et sponsors pouvant permettre un circuit professionnel ainsi qu'un réel show compétitif avec un mode spectateur à la hauteur, et c'est dans cette optique que nous travaillons à implémenter une véritable plateforme claire et accessible composée d'un modèle économique viable et intéressant pour chaque acteur de la scène du sport électronique.
 
Le financement participatif :
Notre studio étant en processus de création, nous avons naturellement débloqué une partie des fonds permettant le développement du jeu et de l'entreprise. Cependant, pour arriver à terme de ce projet, nous avons besoin de votre aide et c'est pour cela que nous faisons appel à vous aujourd'hui!
Grâce à vous, nous pourrons :

Nous doter d'une interface web claire et pratique pour communiquer sur notre jeu et mettre à disposition les outils nécessaires à l'interaction avec la communauté.
Louer des serveurs additionnels. 1000 €

Fournir à notre équipe des outils supplémentaires pour travailler dans les meilleures conditions (licences, softwares...) 2000 €

Mettre à disposition les goodies que nous vous proposons en contreparties. 1000 €

Récompenser notre compositeur musical à hauteur de son talent ! 1000 €

Les paliers : 
L'objectif premier est de réunir la somme de 5000 €. Une fois ce premier palier franchi, nous pourrons lancer convenablement notre projet. Si nous atteignons d'autres paliers plus élevés, en plus de nos sincères remerciements, nous travaillerons à ajouter du contenu en conséquence. Voici les différents paliers :


8000 € > Implémentation de plusieurs mécanismes supplémentaires dans le jeu dont un système qui permettra à chaque joueur de pouvoir personnaliser l'intérieur et l'extérieur de sa maison dans la colonie (housing).

10.000 € > Organisation de tournois avec récompenses dès les phases d'alpha-test pour tester nos fonctionnalités.

15.000 €  > Jeu entièrement doublé en français, voix de qualité pour tous les personnages.
Les packs :
Evidemment, votre soutien sera récompensé, le palier à 10 € vous donnant accès au jeu complet et à l'ensemble des phases de beta-test, vous pourrez également profiter de goodies de plus en plus intéressants en fonction de votre générosité !
Avec ICE Project, nous voulons vous impliquer réellement dans le suivi du jeu, c'est donc pour cela que nous allons proposer du contenu dans un délai assez court (2013) pour qu'il évolue avec vous rapidement et régulièrement.

Vous n'êtes plus seulement spectateur mais bel et bien acteur !

L'équipe :
Ve-Game, avant d'être une entreprise, est avant tout une idée : celle de rassembler un maximum de compétences diverses et variées pour mettre en place des jeux innovants.
Nous avons donc réuni une équipe pour cela, qui sera amenée à s'agrandir au fil du temps :

1 Community Manager (Louis Wyss), chargé d'animer la communauté, de répondre à vos questions, de faire tout simplement le lien entre vous et nous.
1 Responsable de production (Jean-Baptiste Papin), chargé de définir et de contrôler nos objectifs qualitatifs. Il se chargera de la gestion et la mise en place de l'ensemble de nos phases de tests.
1 Lead Artist 3D (Alexandre Ducreux), chargé de modéliser l'ensemble de l'univers en 3D et de rendre vivante cette planète avec des animations de qualité.
2 Concept-Artists (Sylvie Hannedouche & Jeremy Monet), chargés de définir une identité graphique au projet et d'imaginer un monde crédible et vivant.
1 Programmeur (Jose Manuel Martin), le mécano de l'équipe, chargé de s'assurer que tout fonctionne correctement.
1 Compositeur/Sound-Designer (Vincent Govindin), qui doit faire en sorte de vous immerger dans ce monde avec de belles musiques et une ambiance sonore travaillée.
Et pour finir un Chef de projet (Elliott Duffard), moi même. Je dois faire en sorte de mener ce projet à son terme, de m'assurer que l'univers est respecté et les joueurs satisfaits.
Nous vous remercions de l'interêt porté à notre projet et nous espérons qu'il vous plaira autant qu'il nous plaît, si vous voulez nous contacter n'hésitez pas à poster un commentaire et nous nous ferons un plaisir de vous répondre.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Connect the Pieces (CTP) to Prevent Prescription Drug Abuse is a campaign to promote prescription drug safety and awareness in our community.  Drug overdoses are now the number one cause of accidental death in the U.S., recently surpassing traffic fatalities.  Ninety (90) percent of these deaths are due to prescription drug use and misuse. Connect the Pieces empowers families to become a part of the solution to reducing deaths through education and changed behaviors.</p>
<p>Supportive Housing and Innovative Parnterships, Inc. (SHIP) and its soical venture Second Chance Building Materials Center created the Connect The Pieces campaign in a response to this growing epidemic.  Our goal is to develop a coordinated community response to deal with the epidemic of prescription drug abuse in partnership with prescribers, pharmacists, state and local government, law enforcement, family members, friends, schools, churches, businesses and other civic organizations. </p>
</div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>
<p>This year funds will be used to develop a prescription drug safety program for grades K-12, continue to educate parents and grandparents in our community and beyond regarding the deadly consequences of prescription drugs, and continue to provide locking medicine units.</p>
<p>As part of the educational program, we are planning to develop an android app game that educates children on the dangers of prescription drugs. We need funds to make this happen. </p>
<p>For those who donate $100 or more will receive either one of our Connect The Pieces Lapel Pin, Connect the Pieces Black Polo Shirt or one of our Connect The Pieces Locking Medicine Cabinet.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>SHIP relies on the generosity of the members of our community to continue to create second chances for individuals in recovery from substance abuse.  The people we serve come from all walks of life.

<p><b><i>A fresh, new 3D Casual RPG game,
Dragon Crush–Crush or Be Crushed, is under development and looks to appeal to a
wide audience</i></b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>A new innovative 3D casual RPG game
that is currently in development aims to draw gamers into its world with
fantastic graphics, cool characters and an amazing adventure. <a href=""http://igg.me/at/DragonCrush/x/6498807"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dragon Crush RPG</a>
(role-playing game), is the fresh idea from programmer and avid gamer, Jim Pierce who said that true 3D <a href=""http://igg.me/at/DragonCrush/x/6498807"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">RPG</a>
balanced gameplay is his passion.</p>
<p>Dragon Crush has depth, wit and charm. The
storyline of the game takes place in a land called Zendom, which has been
devastated by a powerful dragon. The beast has taken captive Princess Zenora, princess
of Zendom. The player’s role is to defeat the dragon, save the princess and
help restore Zendom back to glory.</p>
<p>According to Pierce, this new <a href=""http://igg.me/at/DragonCrush/x/6498807"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">role-playing</a> game is sure to appeal to the masses with its <span>casual click or touch play with true 3D perspective, epic
battle scenes and the game’s immersive casual RPG play. Gamers will also enjoy
the freedom of interacting in either third- or first-person modes. Another
matchless feature of Dragon Crush is gem crushing, a brilliant enhancing
concept that is sure to impress even the most seasoned gamers. </span></p>
<p>The secret to any good RPG game is balance, said
Pierce, who added that Dragon Crush leverages the culmination of years of game
science to create balance within many dimensions of game play.</p>
<p>Until now, all of the support for the
development of Dragon Crush has been self-funded, according to Pierce. He has
recently launched a fundraising campaign on indiegogo.com. Pierce is looking
for individuals who are interested in helping him bring this innovative new RPG
game to market.</p>
<p>Currently, Pierce said that Dragon Crush is
supported on Mac, Windows and on web browsers. He said he would like to bring
it to mobile as well, specifically iOS, Android and Win8.</p>
<p>“We have more than a dozen experienced
professionals now helping to make Dragon Crush come to life,” said Pierce.</p>
<p>Here is a glimpse into our new 3D world with Lush new Dragon Crush environments: (The pre-orders and contributions  we have received so far is allowing us to purchase wonderful assets for the game at a fraction of the normal production costs!  Please see below a list of all our carefully selected asset contributors!  Our Dragon Crush team is then integrating these wonderful environments, models, animations into our overall game play and fantastic adventure.  Please contribute and continue to let us expand our game inventories and core developers, artists, and designers.)</p>

interesting and what is new in its features?</u></i></b></font></p><p></p><font color=""#000000"" size=""3"">
<p>One of the most
innovative games that I have ever experienced is Dragon Crush. This new innovative
Casual RPG is a game that attracts your attention instantly. The main feature
of the game that is excellent in nature is its casual click or touch play
characteristic along with a 3D perspective that it allows to the gamers. The gamers
also have the freedom to interact in 3D in third or first person modes and playing
it has largely appealed to me and I am sure it will also interest you. </p>
<p>The key ingredient that
makes any RPG game good or stands apart in the market is its balance and Dragon
Crush has managed to create a perfect balance within many dimensions of the
game with the help of math and game science. Equilibrium is also another important
factor for the popularity of a game. It means the ability for creating an
imbalance to become balanced through the system. </p>
<p>Dragon Crush has also succeeded
efficiently in the character development and team battle configuration. It
helps the players to seek the best combinations of strategy through which they
can win easily. The game also has excellent powerful abilities along with an
integral balanced warfare of its characters. Balanced warfare, armor,
gear and weapons all are available in its options. There is a brilliant exciting gem combination that is called Gem Crushing. </p>
<p>Dragon Crush is an
impressive game that brings in the forefront the basic elements of classic RPG
game play with the latest casual RPG. This combination helps you to experience
the best game with exclusive features that are available in the market in the
recent years.</p>
<p>The game is the perfect
example of the combination of modern and innovative systems and does not overload
the player with free to play and in game purchases. It also guides the gamer
throughout the series and helps them to cross each level successfully and
easily. The story of Dragon Crush is excellent and deep. The Princess Zenora
has been captured by the Gold Dragon who actually has the power to consume
gold. Your aim is to save the Princess from the dragon and seek revenge from him.
But before the final fight and actual beginning of the game, you need to train
yourself to fight with the dragons and this training is provided to you as you peer
into the Valley of Dragomar. With this perfectly laid story line you lead further in the game
and try to complete all its missions to accomplish your goal. The game in
totality is a wonderful production of new techniques, modern systems and
technological advancements that you will love to experience. </p></font><p>How is Dragon Crush being made?</p><p>We are using state of the art tools and artists to pull together quality assets to bring Dragon Crush to life!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/464832/files/20140327120209-dragon_crush_unity_3d_medeivel_environments_integration.PNG?1395946929"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The following modules are installed as part of the Dragon Crush game foundation.  We then bring together the assets, animations, and highly addictive Dragon Crush game-play.  Your funds help grow our library of quality assets and let us add unique features, personality, intelligence, and harmony to the overall game.  This method of game development helps us keep costs to a minimum, while providing gamers with Epic scale game play.  Our funds can focus on Dragon Crush game features. A game of this magnitude would not be possible with current budget levels, otherwise. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/464834/files/20140327120223-unity3ddragoncrushassets1.PNG?1395946943"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/464835/files/20140327120235-unity3ddragoncrushassets2.PNG?1395946955"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Plus our Dragon Crush talented developers and Epic Dragon Crush Game-play!</p><p>Game Design and Author bio: Michelle Brumley is a freelance writer from beautiful Post Falls, Idaho.

I am currently a digital designer for Dragon Crush.  If there is one image that can sum up my personality it would be the one to the left.  My mischievous ways<span> and ridiculous sense of humor have lead me to make up nicknames for all my friends. As for them, they dubbed me “ The Knib” with the K being silent. As “The Knib” I’m an inspired cook that loves to barbeque, but never goes to another man’s house and tells him how it’s done. I never shop hungry. It’s about time they make candy with all reds. I’d rather lose my wallet and phone before my keys.

A fresh, new 3D Casual RPG game,
Dragon Crush–Crush or Be Crushed, is under development and looks to appeal to a
wide audience

A new innovative 3D casual RPG game
that is currently in development aims to draw gamers into its world with
fantastic graphics, cool characters and an amazing adventure. Dragon Crush RPG
(role-playing game), is the fresh idea from programmer and avid gamer, Jim Pierce who said that true 3D RPG
balanced gameplay is his passion.
Dragon Crush has depth, wit and charm. The
storyline of the game takes place in a land called Zendom, which has been
devastated by a powerful dragon. The beast has taken captive Princess Zenora, princess
of Zendom. The player’s role is to defeat the dragon, save the princess and
help restore Zendom back to glory.
According to Pierce, this new role-playing game is sure to appeal to the masses with its casual click or touch play with true 3D perspective, epic
battle scenes and the game’s immersive casual RPG play. Gamers will also enjoy
the freedom of interacting in either third- or first-person modes. Another
matchless feature of Dragon Crush is gem crushing, a brilliant enhancing
concept that is sure to impress even the most seasoned gamers. 
The secret to any good RPG game is balance, said
Pierce, who added that Dragon Crush leverages the culmination of years of game
science to create balance within many dimensions of game play.
Until now, all of the support for the
development of Dragon Crush has been self-funded, according to Pierce. He has
recently launched a fundraising campaign on indiegogo.com. Pierce is looking
for individuals who are interested in helping him bring this innovative new RPG
game to market.
Currently, Pierce said that Dragon Crush is
supported on Mac, Windows and on web browsers. He said he would like to bring
it to mobile as well, specifically iOS, Android and Win8.
“We have more than a dozen experienced
professionals now helping to make Dragon Crush come to life,” said Pierce.
Here is a glimpse into our new 3D world with Lush new Dragon Crush environments: (The pre-orders and contributions  we have received so far is allowing us to purchase wonderful assets for the game at a fraction of the normal production costs!  Please see below a list of all our carefully selected asset contributors!  Our Dragon Crush team is then integrating these wonderful environments, models, animations into our overall game play and fantastic adventure.  Please contribute and continue to let us expand our game inventories and core developers, artists, and designers.)





Dragon Crush Training Ground: 









Dragon Crush features Casual click or touch play in true 3D
perspective, while observing epic battles.  Gamers have the freedom to
interact in 3D in third or first person modes; however, the immersive Casual
RPG play will appeal to the masses.
The secret to any good RPG game is balance.  Dragon
Crush leverages the culmination of hundreds of years of math and game science
to create balance within many dimensions of game play.  More important
than balance is equilibrium, which is the ability for an imbalance in the
system to become balanced throughout the system.
Character development and team battle configuration
strategy is an essential element of repeat game play.  Using Single Path
Solution Theory, achievement levels are created with single or minimal (x) path
solutions in which players seek the best strategy combination to win.


Balance of power is also integral to balanced
warfare.  Armor, Gear, and Weapons all can be enhanced using a powerful
and brilliantly exciting gem combination, called Gem Crushing.  With every
combination, the Gems get stronger and can be used to enhance each item.
Dragon Crush brings the elements of classic RPG game play
together with the latest Casual RPG.
Dragon Crush will utilize an innovative monetization system that does not overload the player with Free-to-Play and in-game purchases.  (Responsible monetization)  There is also balance in the amount of value a gamer receives and is willing to invest over time.  This balance of reward value is paramount to the game’s success.   
As you defeat enemies, they become part of your team that will be Allies to aid in the defeat the Gold Dragon!  Game characters can be sent to the Cloud for 3D printing and shipped to Gamers or sent to their local 3D printer.  Your game is truly immortalized.

Dragon Crush story has depth, wit, and charm.  Your
beloved home land Zendom has been ravaged by the legendary Gold Dragon. 
The princess Zenora has been captured by the Gold Dragon.

The Gold Dragon is not just gold colored but is actually
made from gold.  The Gold Dragon has the special power to consume gold.
 The sheer weight of the Dragon will Crush an opponent in a single
blow.  It is said that if the Gold Dragon is killed, all the gold from all
the treasures consumed will turn into a pile of gold.
As you seek revenge and vow to save the Princess from
certain doom, you arrive at the Valley of Dragomar.  You will need help to
destroy a Dragon.  You will need training.  You peer into the
small valley of Dragomar, known for its training of Dragon Knights.
Your journey begins...

interesting and what is new in its features?
One of the most
innovative games that I have ever experienced is Dragon Crush. This new innovative
Casual RPG is a game that attracts your attention instantly. The main feature
of the game that is excellent in nature is its casual click or touch play
characteristic along with a 3D perspective that it allows to the gamers. The gamers
also have the freedom to interact in 3D in third or first person modes and playing
it has largely appealed to me and I am sure it will also interest you. 
The key ingredient that
makes any RPG game good or stands apart in the market is its balance and Dragon
Crush has managed to create a perfect balance within many dimensions of the
game with the help of math and game science. Equilibrium is also another important
factor for the popularity of a game. It means the ability for creating an
imbalance to become balanced through the system. 
Dragon Crush has also succeeded
efficiently in the character development and team battle configuration. It
helps the players to seek the best combinations of strategy through which they
can win easily. The game also has excellent powerful abilities along with an
integral balanced warfare of its characters. Balanced warfare, armor,
gear and weapons all are available in its options. There is a brilliant exciting gem combination that is called Gem Crushing. 
Dragon Crush is an
impressive game that brings in the forefront the basic elements of classic RPG
game play with the latest casual RPG. This combination helps you to experience
the best game with exclusive features that are available in the market in the
recent years.
The game is the perfect
example of the combination of modern and innovative systems and does not overload
the player with free to play and in game purchases. It also guides the gamer
throughout the series and helps them to cross each level successfully and
easily. The story of Dragon Crush is excellent and deep. The Princess Zenora
has been captured by the Gold Dragon who actually has the power to consume
gold. Your aim is to save the Princess from the dragon and seek revenge from him.
But before the final fight and actual beginning of the game, you need to train
yourself to fight with the dragons and this training is provided to you as you peer
into the Valley of Dragomar. With this perfectly laid story line you lead further in the game
and try to complete all its missions to accomplish your goal. The game in
totality is a wonderful production of new techniques, modern systems and
technological advancements that you will love to experience.

Common Carl: he is pretty much cannon fodder; abundant but not much of a threat.


Punk Patrick: faster than a bullet, terrifying scream; not to strong yet quite fast!


Hillbilly Harry: He might not be the brightest nor the fastest, but he knows how to take a hit!


Riot Ralph: That riot shield makes him quite a challenge! Have you heard about testudo formation?

Hockey Hank: Not very friendly. 'Nuff said.
Three zombies that can be designed by our backers who pledge for the necromancer perk. *Restrictions apply read below.

Hillbilly Harry: No sera el mas inteligente, ni el mas rápido, pero como aguanta golpes!
Riot Ralph: Su escudo lo convierte en un gran enemigo!
Hockey Hank: No es muy amigable, tampoco hay mas que decir.
Tres zombies que podrán diseñar nuestros donadores! *Aplican restricciones, lee abajo.

Muchos mas zombies no anunciados!

Yes, I’m also wondering where did Timmy got an almost unlimited stock of rubber ducks, moreover, grenades? Who keeps grenades at home? I guess GrumpyLand is a strange place after all.Our game will have 20 weapons when released, additionally more will be added. Most of the ideas to create these have so far came from our own imagination or our friends’ suggestions. If you have any suggestions for new types of weapons tell us! Remember the weapon-crafter perks allow you to design your own weapon! *Restrictions apply read below.Each weapon aims to fulfill a role, for example tennis balls are meant to be your most abundant ammunition, explosives are intended to be used for crowd control. Additionally you have weapons like cupcakes that slow down zombies or rubber ducks that are pretty much useless, however they are quite hilarious.  Our weapons will add balance to the game, yet their supply rate will keep up the challenge.( Spanish - Español )Sí, yo también me estoy preguntando de donde obtuvo Timmy un número ilimitado de patitos de hule, ¿y las granadas qué? ¿Quién las guarda en su casa? Supongo que GrumpyLand es un lugar extraño después de todo. Nuestro juego tendrá 20 armas cuando sea lanzado, posteriormente se añadan más. La mayoría de las ideas en las que nos basamos para crear las armas han venido de nuestra imaginación o de las sugerencias de nuestros amigos. Si tienes algunas sugerencia para nuevas armas, ¡dinos! Recuerda que obtener el perk weapon-crafter te permitirá diseñar tu propia arma! *Aplican restricciones, lee abajo.Cada arma cumple un rol, por ejemplo, las pelotas de tenis serán tu munición más abundante, en cambio, los explosivos te servirán para mantener a ralla a los enemigos. Ademas, tienes armas como pastelitos que alentaran a los zombies, o patitos de hule que no sirven para nada, pero están chistosos! Nuestras armas añadirán balance al juego, pero también la velocidad de suministro mantendrá el reto.These items will enhance playability! Each time you kill a zombie the power-up bar will fill up. There are 3 fill levels, each level will allow you to acquire more powerful items. You can get anything from extra lives, a blizzard slowing down zombies, the very useful atomic bomb and many others! Additionally our backers who get the Grumpy UFO perk or above will get a special power-up!( Spanish - Español )Estos items hacen más entretenido el juego. Cada vez que matas a un zombie la barra de poder se va llenando. Hay tres niveles de llenado, cada nivel te permitirá obtener items más poderosos. Puedes obtener vidas extras, tormenta de hielo, la muy útil bomba atómica, ¡y muchos más! Adicionalmente, nuestros donadores que obtengan el perk Grumpy UFO y en adelante, tendrán un power-up especial que nadie más tendrá.We are 4 Mexican computer science and digital art students who casually decided to start a game this January 2013. So far we have been working on the game for a year, and we have really enjoyed it.We are:

David, artist


Daniel, designer, programmer


Carlos, programmer

Gustavo, programmer
Carlos, Gustavo and Daniel ( all studying computer science ) met at school, Daniel and David are siblings. Like you, we love playing video games, and as gamers one always dreams on creating or collaborate on a game, so naturally the idea of creating our own is quite appealing. As creative and talented people we decided to take this on our hands, and thats how Grumpy Zombies was born!Being able to work with your friends on something you enjoy is an unique experience!( Spanish - Español )Somos 4 estudiantes mexicanos de ciencias computacionales y arte digital quienes casualmente decidimos empezar a hacer un video juego en enero de 2013. Hemos trabajado en el juego por un año y realmente lo hemos disfrutado.Somos:

David, artista

Daniel, diseñador, programador

Carlos, programador

Gustavo, programador
Carlos, Gustavo y Daniel ( los tres estudiantes de ciencias computacionales ) se conocieron en la escuela, Daniel y David son hermanos. Como tú, nos encantan los video juegos, y como gamers siempre hemos soñado con crear o colaborar en un videojuego, así que naturalmente la idea de crear nuestro propio videojuego es muy atractiva. Como gente talentosa y creativa decidimos tomar esto en nuestras manos y así es como Grumpy Zombies nació.El poder trabajar con tus amigos en algo que disfrutas es una experiencia única.David has dedicated his life to traditional art where he stands out. Currently he is exploring new territories, aiming at conquering the digital frontier; switching from pencil to stylus, where results have been amazing. This translates to amazing in-game visuals, carefully drawn textures and beautiful 3D models. We spare no time at ensuring every texture detail is at its finest, this has let to the game looking terrific.( Spanish - Español )David ha dedicado su vida al arte tradicional donde ha sobresalido. Actualmente él está explorando nuevos territorios, con el objetivo de conquistar la frontera digital cambiando el lápiz por un stylus y los resultados han sido fantásticos. Esto se traduce en gráficas de juego sorprendentes, texturas cuidadosamente dibujadas y hermosos modelos 3D. No escatimamos en tiempo para asegurar que cada detalle de las texturas este a su máximo, esto ha echo que el juego se vea muy bien.The game favors humorous encounters and situations that enhance playability. The game is fun, challenging and rewarding, we can guarantee you’ll enjoy it.Last October Facebook visited our campus and they did a hackathon ( a 24 hour marathon where you have to create a unique app ). We participated, and created a game from scratch ( nothing too fancy, just an endless runner ). The Facebook engineers liked it and we won the first place in the hackathon, so they flew us to their hackathon finals at their headquarters on Silicon Valley. This time we did a collaborative multiplayer game. This occasion we won third place, and for sure we have realized that our passion is video game development, and that we are more than capable to create games.During the past year we have taken the challenge of making this game, we have always taken the approach of building this game with the best quality, and we believe our progress reflects that. Our only wish is to ensure we give this project a proper conclusion, that is why we are reaching to you, we want your help to finish our year long game.( Spanish - Español )El octubre pasado Facebook visitó nuestra escuela dónde hicieron un hackathon ( un maratón de programación donde tienes que crear una app única ) Nosotros participamos y creamos un juego desde cero ( nada muy complicado ). A los ingenieros de Facebook les gustó y así ganamos el primer lugar, así que nos fuimos a la final en Silicon Valley, California, esta ocasión hicimos un juego multijugador cooperativo, esta vez ganamos el tercer lugar y con seguridad nos dimos cuenta que nuestra pasión es el desarrollo de video juegos y que somos más que capaces de hacer juegos.Durante todo el año pasado hemos tomado el reto de hacer este juego, siempre enfocados en hacer este juego con la mejor calidad y creemos que nuestro progreso refleja esto. Lo único que queremos es darle a este juego la conclusión que se merece, es por esto que acudimos a ti, necesitamos tu ayuda para terminar nuestro juego.Well, back in January 2013 when we started developing the game we were just 4 moneyless students with some free time on their hands looking to create something amazing, 13 months later we are still moneyless students, but now with no time to spare. It has been one amazing ride and we know we have something great on our hands, yet we have also realized that making a game is not actually free, and its quite time consuming. Some of us have part time jobs to pay for tuition fees, we would like to use part of the money we raise to quite those jobs so that we can dedicate full time to the game together as a team without worrying about anything other than this amazing project and college of course. Furthermore, there are a lot of expenses related to music & sound, licensing, marketing etc. Although Daniel has made the main game's theme, a proper game needs a full soundtrack, we wish to hire a talented local musician to help us with that! Also we need an audio engineer that will work on matching the quality of our sound effects to that of our art & gameplay.With your help we can finish this game properly, because we believe that leaving it unfinished would be terrible.( Spanish - Español )Bueno, de vuelta en enero de 2013 cuando empezamos a desarrollar el juego éramos 4 estudiantes sin dinero con un poco de tiempo libre en sus manos buscando crear algo sorprendente, 13 meses después seguimos siendo estudiantes sin dinero pero ahora sin nada de tiempo libre. Ha sido algo maravilloso y sabemos que tenemos algo grande en nuestras manos, pero también nos hemos dado cuenta que hacer un video juego no es del todo gratis y definitivamente consume mucho tiempo.Algunos de nosotros tenemos trabajos para pagar nuestros estudios, queremos usar parte de el dinero que recaudemos para dejar de trabajar y dedicar tiempo completo al desarrollo del juego juntos como equipo sin tener que preocuparnos por nada más que este maravilloso proyecto y la escuela por supuesto.Además, hay muchos otros gastos relacionados con música, sonido, licencias, mercadotecnia etc. A pesar de que Daniel ha hecho el tema musical principal un juego necesita un soundtrack completo. Queremos contratar a algún músico local talentoso que nos ayude con esto. También necesitamos un ingeniero en audio que nos ayude a que nuestros efectos de sonido estén relacionados con el concepto de arte.Con tu ayuda podemos terminar este juego apropiadamente, porque creemos que dejarlo incompleto sería terrible.Backer ribbon: When you connect to Facebook with our game you can keep track of your scores and see how your friends are doing.

In every Level, you get to rescue different Ducks with super powers. They will be available to be chosen for the next Level to help you with their powers to solve puzzles and kill monsters!

We had friends trying it out and they find the game mechanics and the multi-choices are surprisingly challenging and addicting. They kept wanting to try out the different combinations until we had to kick them out of the house! This made us very confident in starting this campaign.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: small; line-height: 1.45em; font-family: verdana, geneva;"">We still need to implement more graphics, sound and cut scenes. We also need to have the game running on different platforms before we can formally release. It does take time and we hope to finish it around 6 months. If we're lucky to have all the features on our stretch goals, it may take a bit more time. But whatever happens, we will do all we can to release Supper Duck as soon as possible!</span></p>

He disguised himself as an enormous Duck taller than a mountain that shows up behind a curtain.Definitely not controlled by fear, ducks were amazed by the huge muscular body of Sardin and praise him like a God. They worship him day by day and prepares his favorite Tomato hot spring pool inside a volcano every month. Ducks are so busy and have no time for fishing!Things were going well until one day, the smartest looking duck contributed a Fat chili instead of a tomato and caused the Beak Bang explosion.The son of Sardin, Dhor wanted to restore peace to dUcktopia and started his journey. Dhor suited up as a duck and went to the scattered islands that was formed by the Beak Bang to rescue all the ducklings.

 

""Supper Duck : To the Rescue"" is the first game of our Supper Duck series.
 It starts with the story where dUcktopia fell into chaos by a huge explosion due to a misplaced fat chilli into the tomato hot spring bath for their sardine God. The Beak-Bang explosion sent ducks flying and stuck in the Scattered Islands. 

Supper Duck is a 2D action puzzle game where you will play as Supper Duck to dive into the dangerous Scattered Islands while ducking fire, fighting monsters and finding the best way to rescue ducks.
We like games with a lot of choices and different ways to win. In every Level, you get to rescue different Ducks with super powers. They will be available to be chosen for the next Level to help you with their powers to solve puzzles and kill monsters! Every level has their own challenges, there is never one best combination of Ducks for the game.
We get tired of games very easily, so this game must be good or we won't be making it!New Gameplay Update - Pink Stars are Falling!
Go rescue all those hilarious Ducks in dUcktopia now!
 
Here are some of the ducks in dUcktopia:

Making a game is challenging and surprises may happen.To ensures that we can deliver the game, we made a running prototype of the game before we started this campaign. We had friends trying it out and they find the game mechanics and the multi-choices are surprisingly challenging and addicting. They kept wanting to try out the different combinations until we had to kick them out of the house! This made us very confident in starting this campaign.
We still need to implement more graphics, sound and cut scenes. We also need to have the game running on different platforms before we can formally release. It does take time and we hope to finish it around 6 months. If we're lucky to have all the features on our stretch goals, it may take a bit more time. But whatever happens, we will do all we can to release Supper Duck as soon as possible!

River.

Seth in a mortal fight, this warrior was known as Horus the son of 
Osirid. The power of Seth was sealed in two: the red Ankh and a human 
body...""</strong></p>
<p>Our story begins after these events our Hero is the son of Osiris and
 he is a young wizard who is training to become the magician of the 1st 
Egyptian dynasty. His master Shu (the God of air), was a great friend of
 his father Horus and he was chosen to protect the Ankh until our Hero 
was ready. Princess Kheti the young girl that you can see in the trailer
 is the daughter of Pharaoh Menes; Horus sealed part of Seth power 
inside her to prevent the return of darkness on earth. The Egyptian 
peoples regards Kheti as if she were Seth himself and she was shunned by
 her classmates, who out of fear and anger, hated her. Our hero will 
become the only friend of Kethi and this is why he will do anything to 
save her life and prevent the return of Seth.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/626558/files/20140604160453-kid.jpg?1401923093"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Nut the fox your inseparable friend, will help you discover the Sahara

 raise enough money to make the best game we can. Here is what we will

<p><strong>Software:</strong> Help us afford the software needed for pushing this game even forward.</p>

rights for this song we thoughts anyway to let you know.</p>
<p><strong>Create an Editor:</strong> We are considering making a level 
editor, in that way after completing the game experience you will be 
able to play with custom platform levels, the level editor will never 
happen without your help.</p>
<p><strong>Polish:</strong> We generally don't like releasing anything unless it has undergone a lot of polish.</p>
<p>Our vision for Eternal Desert Sunshine is innovation and fun and by

<br/><br/></strong></div>","“Eternal Desert Sunshine” is a third-person adventure game with platform
 and shooter elements. The game is set in ancient Egypt with numerous 
references to the myth of Horus and Seth. You will be living a surreal 
adventure under the sun of Egyptian desert and along the legendary Nile 
River. Use the power of the Ankh and save Egypt from the return of Seth.The major inspirations for Eternal Desert Sunshine are: Shadow of the
 Colossus, Journey, To the Moon and Future Boy Conan (Miyazaki).""A long time ago after the death of Osirid Seth ruled Egypt 
bringing chaos and destruction but 5000 years ago one warrior sealed 
Seth in a mortal fight, this warrior was known as Horus the son of 
Osirid. The power of Seth was sealed in two: the red Ankh and a human 
body...""
Our story begins after these events our Hero is the son of Osiris and
 he is a young wizard who is training to become the magician of the 1st 
Egyptian dynasty. His master Shu (the God of air), was a great friend of
 his father Horus and he was chosen to protect the Ankh until our Hero 
was ready. Princess Kheti the young girl that you can see in the trailer
 is the daughter of Pharaoh Menes; Horus sealed part of Seth power 
inside her to prevent the return of darkness on earth. The Egyptian 
peoples regards Kheti as if she were Seth himself and she was shunned by
 her classmates, who out of fear and anger, hated her. Our hero will 
become the only friend of Kethi and this is why he will do anything to 
save her life and prevent the return of Seth.Nut the fox your inseparable friend, will help you discover the Sahara 
Desert. Eternal Desert Sunshine combines the precision of a first person shooter
 with the connection to the character you get from a third person game. 
You can twist and turn with the target always on your sight, the game 
was designed around mouse and keyboard controls. Your weapon the 
legendary ""Eye of Ra"" behaves as an independent living entity and during
 the missions you will unlock new powers including the ability to create
 and build. In This journey you will meet strange and terrifying 
characters and in the giant Sahara desert you will find many temple 
complexes that will feature platforms and rpg elements. Be ready to live
 a dramatic and cinematic adventure!The game environments are inspired from some of the most incredible 
Places of Egypt: Abu Simbel, Valley of the Kings, Karnak 
Temple and Giza Necropolis are only few of the monuments and temples 
that you will see.""So my mind skins in this immensity: and foundering is sweet in such a sea.”
Giacomo Leopardi -The InfiniteIn these dramatic political events that have put Egyptian tourism sector
 'on its knees' this project can be seen as a small dream in a Land full
 of magic and history.All the dialogues in the game are written but that does not stop us from giving facial animation to the characters of the game.For us it's important to express feelings and emotions in the best way possible!Karnak Arts is a new studio. Indiegogo is the easiest way for us to 
find and chat with players like you in an open and honest way. We hope 
you’ll share your opinions with us and help us refine the game.
We also chose IndieGoGo because we hope to
 raise enough money to make the best game we can. Here is what we will 
use the money for:
Software: Help us afford the software needed for pushing this game even forward.
Audio & voiceover: For this trailer we have used
 low budget voiceover we would love to have other amazing professional 
voiceover inside the game! We are in contact with 3 musicians that show 
interest in the project and have already joined the team:
-Fabrizio Santososso
-Isthar
-Gabe Castro
And we don't think they should work for free.
The music that have inspired this story is ""The host of Seraphin"" 
from the album ""The Serpent's Egg"" of English-Australian neoclassical 
band ""Dead Can Dance"" we obviously will never be able to afford the 
rights for this song we thoughts anyway to let you know.
Create an Editor: We are considering making a level 
editor, in that way after completing the game experience you will be 
able to play with custom platform levels, the level editor will never 
happen without your help.
Polish: We generally don't like releasing anything unless it has undergone a lot of polish.
Our vision for Eternal Desert Sunshine is innovation and fun and by 
contributing to our campaign you will empower that idea and make this 
happens.We have been working hard on ""Eternal Desert Sunshine"" for the past 2 
years and we believe that
 with your help we can improve almost every 
aspect of this game.Karnak Arts is an independent game studio based in Milan(Italy), founded in 2012 by Ahmed Awad.“I was born in Egypt in the village of 
Karnak surrounded by the beauty of Karnak temple complex, Luxor temple 
and the Valley of the Kings and Queens.
With Eternal Desert Sunshine my hope is to bring the old magic sensation of ancient Egypt in a surrealistic game experience.”
Ahmed Awad




Karnak Arts is a group of devolopers with a deep passion for videogames and 3d 
art in general. We started working on Eternal Desert Sunshine 2 year ago 
focusing on every aspect of the game (Story, character design, game 
programming, game design , 3d models…) in the trailer you can see the 
first working prototype of the game. We have also invested some money to 
buy the essential software and the rights for the music and sounds 
inside the Trailer because we believe that ""Eternal Desert Sunshine"" with
 your help can become a great story.

</div></div>","Our Story

Blackwyrm Books And Games is a publisher of experimental fiction and quality roleplaying games. In conjunction with Hero Games' release of the Star Hero 6th Edition roleplaying game at GenCon 2011, we are attempting to simultaneously release seven science fiction settings that can be played using the Star Hero rules.  
 
We're calling this entire undertaking Project WyrmStar. 



The Impact

Hero Games isn't planning on releasing any settings for Star Hero: only the core rulebook and some equipment books. We are hoping to ""fill the gap"" that leaves by releasing unique and interesting setting books that can be used to play the game immediately, rather than forcing Game Masters to take the time to create their own setting. 
 
The Widening Gyre for HERO System 6th Edition is one of these settings. 



What We Need & What You Get

We need to raise about $1000.00 to get a print run of The Widening Gyre out of the door in time for GenCon 2011.

Introduction
Welcome to the 19th Century that never was! It is a world of wonder, of horror, of adventure, of magic, of strange technology and unprecedented cultural revolution. This is an age that should have been, filled with radium-powered flying machines, clockwork automata, and steam-driven computers. It is an age of dark magic, sinister secrets, and unholy cults. It is a time in which the world teeters on the edge of chaos, where the enlightened scientific mind battled against ancient superstition and ignorance, in which the souls of all mankind hung in the balance. 
 
Bill Keyes The Widening Gyre presents a glimpse at the Industrial Age as it truly was, envisioned by those far-sighted luminaries and Savants who looked beyond the feeble limitations of man and created a world in which science, technology, and logic triumphed over the mundane physical limitations of the Universe. And yet, Logic’s victory is far from complete. This is also a dark and gothic world, where monsters from ages long past still prowl and men with evil motives call upon ancient sorceries to grant them the power to control the world. 
 
The Widening Gyre is a world in which you'll play consulting detectives and adventuring academics, occultist thrill-seekers and Savants both heroic and insane, all working for a secretive organization of benevolent technologists who seek to prevent the dark monsters of humanity’s past from overwhelming its bright and burgeoning future.
 
Welcome to the Widening Gyre!
 
 
What’s In This Book?
The Widening Gyre presents an entire world of adventure in the 19th Century That Never Was, but it is not a complete game in itself. To use it, Game masters should have a copy of the HERO System 6th Edition Volumes 1 and 2, or the Hero System Basic Rulebook.
 
Game masters should read the entire book through to learn about the genre and the world of the Widening Gyre. Pay special attention to Chapter One, which gives the history of the world, Chapter Three, which outlines character creation, and Chapter Six, which talks about the core concepts of Steampunk, including sugges­tions for different types of Widening Gyre campaigns, such as one which highlights the Gothic Horror and magical aspects of the world, and another in which high coal-fired technology takes the center stage. If you're a player, the information on character generation presented in Chapter Three will be of most use to you.
 
Chapter One, The Center Cannot Hold (The World of the Widening Gyre), discusses the history of the world of The Widening Gyre, and how it diverges from the world with which we are familiar. 
 
Chapter Two, The Falcon Can Not Hear the Falconer (Organizations in the Widening Gyre), presents several organizations that can help, hinder, or harm the heroes.
 
Chapter Three, Passionate Intensity (Creating Characters), shows how to create a character, including packages for Steam Age heroes. It also describes how to use many HERO System character creation elements, like Skills, Perks, and Powers, discussing how to use them in the genre and providing expanded rules.
Chapter Four, Darkness Drops Again (Weapons, Equipment, & Magic), offers an enticing look at the weapons, vehicles, gadgets, and gear of the Age of Steam. Furthermore, it provides a dark, gothic magic system for use in your campaign, including an extensive list of spells and sorcerous powers.
 
Chapter Five, Mere Anarchy is Loosed, contains a complete, ready-to-run adventure that can be used to introduce new groups to the game, or to slip into an existing campaign. It includes sample NPCs who can be used to play the adventure, or as friends, foils, or foes for your regular group.
 
Chapter Six, Turning and Turning (A Steampunk Sourcebook), is a discussion of the Steampunk genre, touching on several subgenres which can be attached to any game. It includes a brief historical overview of the Victorian Era (roughly 1830 to 1901), and continues with a list of the conventions of the genre – those things that put the ""steam"" in Steampunk – then shows how to apply the ideas and concepts to your game.

<p>Hello everyone, I’m Angelous L Gonzalez, president, creative director and the mind behind the Aeternus Eternus world. Alongside me I have Redys Padron <em>(VP/marketing specialist)</em>, Steven McIntire <em>(modeling/animation/rigging/tech support)</em>, Michael Burroughs <em>(producing/business)</em>, and Jorge Soto-Marce <em>(special effects/ animation/concept art)</em>. We’re here to raise the $2,180,000 for our first game of the Aeternus Eternus series, AE Shatranj.</p>
<p><em>In the Aeternus Eternus universe, all life, individual Spirits are incomplete… Our true loves (twin flame) are our other half as we are theirs.  It’s only upon meeting our most beloved flame where we gain the opportunity to become one;  To become one is to unite with our most beloved swan as “human angels ready to earn our ever-wings.”</em></p>
<p>In AE Shatranj<em> (Action-Strategy/Adventure RPG),</em> we introduce the Aeternus Eternus universe. You learn about relationships as you engage different characters and create your bond(s) with all those you meet throughout your adventure and moments of great challenge! You create your unique guardian which acts as the lead role for your team of sworn brothers and sisters, along with your created beloved flame who takes on the role of one of your soldiers.</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p>Redys, Steven, Michael, Jorge, Rey, and I all have diverse backgrounds with a shared vision: To integrate magic, life, beauty, and art into every one of our games, creating an experience within the Aeternus Eternus universe that will not only be fun, but also interesting.</p>
<p>This series is (so far) divided into three parts, however we are here for part one in the series; and for our beloved AE Shatranj we have estimated a cost of $2,180,000.</p>
<p><strong>Projected Expenses</strong></p>
<p><strong>Team</strong> – We need more team members to join our band of adventurers. We already have a long list of highly experienced, talented, and very enthusiastic creative individuals ready to become a part of the Kamla Arts team.</p>
<p><strong>Equipment</strong> – Workstations - 3D Development, Programming</p>
<p>Software - Maya 2013, Photoshop, Visual Studio, Unreal Engine</p>
<p><strong>Legal Fees</strong> – Pending legal fees for when we get the full funding for AE Shatranj such as copyright, licensing, contracts, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Utilities/Necessities</strong> – Studio Lease, Electricity, Furniture (Desks, Lighting, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>Reserve</strong> – For the unexpected so we have the ability to resolve any unforeseen issues.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What is <em>AE Shatranj and what inspired its creation</em>?</strong></p>
<p>                </p>
<p><strong>Overall Gameplay Mechanics</strong></p>
<p>                I have my own collection of favorite games across all platforms. Yet as much as I enjoy them I tend to find myself longing for more which pushed me towards finding the <em>Aeternus Eternus </em>series and <em>AE Shatranj</em>; much like how Michelangelo felt and brought alive his Pietà.</p>
<p><em>AE Shatranj</em> integrates aspects of martial arts and gives players a sense of freedom, along with moving with great agility in outrageously fun, fast paced game play. In martial arts, we learn that we as individuals are constantly creating our reality within each moment with our every thought/action. To bring this into the game play, we took combat principals/discipline from martial arts and applied it to how players move while engaged in combat, in addition to focusing on the “feel” of game play and individual expression.</p>
<p><strong>Character Customization</strong></p>
<p>                Much like a university where you choose your major, you know that your area of study is not a full definition of your abilities. Choosing a warrior type that has a uniquely free way of using magic as a primary ability for example does not limit you to only magic items or abilities. You are able to define your warrior in any of the other abilities, skill subsets, and items that are available.</p>
<p>                While you are not limited to any ability, you have your selection of skill subsets.  If for instance you pick a swordsmanship style for your weapons ability, you have certain skills and weapons exclusive to that style. Players are also able to choose passive/core skills for their warrior which greatly helps to grow character combat, social, and personal traits, along with giving a sense of deeper meaning to their own character.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Warrior Types &amp; Primary Abilities</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Spell Star</em></strong><em> - Similar to a sorcerer/tempered berserker/monk.  Direct with their magic while in combat, often allowing for close up encounters.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Arc Magnus </em></strong><em>- Much like a mage/scout/artillery.  Plans ahead and takes care of anything from a distance.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Valkyric</em></strong><em> - An infused druid/priestess/Kunoichi. Excels at using stealth while providing versatile support and crowd control.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Paladins </em></strong><em>- A hybrid tank/priest/summoner. Able to provide a bubble/wall of defense for allies and also excels at taking on those of hatred/envy/corruption.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Slayers </em></strong><em>- Enraged berserkers/anti-magic. Specializes in nullifying and sealing magic while also able to provide great strength in the front lines.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Techni </em></strong><em>- An engineer/heavy support/Mechi specialist. Provides a range of support to many platoons while taking charge of the battlefield.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Story, Environment, and Character Development;  </strong></p>
<p>                The Aeternus Eternus world is filled with a multitude of peoples, cultures, nations, and so forth...  To enhance the experience, we thought a lot about the individual aspects of what makes an individual. Starting with common traits, we turned to character lineage, which include Draconian (Dragon), Devil (Lamia/Succubus), Moon Elven (Moonlight Children), Minataurous (Titan), Searians (Spirits of Water Elementals), Valkyries (Devas [?] of the Foxy Wing-Lings), Fays (People of the Flower Gardens), and many more.</p>
<p>The magic, weapons, and core skills not only give arsenals to the player but also define a sense of individuality, forms of individual expression; a key in what shapes us as humans. The character lineage contributes to this by adding a sense of heritage or culture such as gestures, features, mannerisms, quirks, and slight preferences that kinship share. </p>
<p>                We as individuals have our own unique experiences, and it’s our choices that create the venture, which defines ourselves as we continue to learn and grow into the future. In Aeternus Eternus, players are able to make similar decisions and define their own venture or path. This also means there is no right path for any one player, what may be good for one player may not be as good for another. In other words, there are no good/neutral/bad choices, there are instead options provided that are a reflection of the expressions and uniqueness of that individual player, and making a choice that more reflects that character will have the best outcome. This not only allows more freedom and flow throughout their endeavor, it allows them to experience this through interactions and understandings with team mates and those encountered along the way. These experiences vary slightly with each player, and the choices made grant more depth into the further development of their character.</p>
<p><strong>Core of <em>Aeternus Eternus</em></strong></p>
<p>The vastness of Aeternus Eternus is love, and all aspects are tied to that essence. Most especially, the love between twin flames and how their love forms, expresses, and identifies their identity as individuals and as two in one.</p>
<p> When players fight, they do so alongside their beloved twin flame. They are accompanied with the many opportunities to learn, understand, interact, engage, and grow with their most beloved. In a sense, it is experiencing what it is to live and fight alongside your most precious one; Thus Player’s actions and movement are symbiotic with their mate. Their mate has their own actions and thoughts, yet still corresponds to the player’s, inspiring that feeling of intimacy in their most precious relationship.</p>
<p>We want the players to constantly keep answering questions such as:</p>
<p>What is that that matters most? Why is it that we fight? Strive? What do we live for?</p>
<p>Ultimately this gives a unique and fresh approach with personal traits, along with individual growth via your choices and relations. All of which are synonymous with love, the ways in which we experience and express ourselves within the virtual universe.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Questions: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: Why are we asking for $2,350,000 when we need $2,180,000?</strong></p>
<p><em>A: The additional $170,000 to the requested $2,180,000 is the estimated fee for using Indiegogo.com</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><strong>Q: Why Flexible funding?</strong></p>
<p><em>A: To continue on we need the full funding; flexible funding would guarantee us to finish pre-production and move on to production. Getting the full funding will allow us to go full forward all the way</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: Where are we at as of now?</strong></p>
<p><em>A: We have most of the design concept done; we need a few more team members to finish it, thereby completing pre-production. Afterwards with more members we can immediately start production, which brings us here to Indiegogo.com</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: What game(s) is out there that is closest to AE Shatranj?</strong></p>
<p><em>A:  AE Shatranj is a game that is new to the industry with original key mechanics in gameplay, story, and focus. As such it is very difficult to find something close to it that has already been done. With that said, the closest would probably have to be the following; Tales of the Abyss, Baldur’s Gate II: Shadows of Amn, Infinite Undiscovery, Kingdom Hearts, Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn, Final Fantasy XII, and the 2008 Prince of Persia. All of the games mentioned are great games, each offering something very enjoying that captures our hearts;</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>In Prince of Persia, the way Prince and Elika work so well with each other</em></li>
<li><em>Final Fantasy XII, the rich world filled with diversity</em></li>
<li><em>Kingdom Hearts, the appreciation of friendship and courage</em></li>
<li><em>Baldur’s Gate II: Shadows of Amn, the immense amount of lore and grand selection of customization</em></li>
<li><em>Tales of the Abyss, The quirky characters and the development of Luke’s relationship with Tear</em></li>
<li><em>Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn, the use of tactics and strategic play</em></li>
</ul><p><em>Certain aspects of these wonderful games are shared in AE Shatranj.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><strong>Q: What is different about AE Shatranj and the AE world?</strong></p>
<p><em>A: There are many key differences with AE Shatranj with which we'd like to keep secret for now, however there are some aspects which we can share; example,</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>AE Shatranj along with the Aeternus Eternus series itself has unique gameplay, original abilities for Guardians along with an original interpretation of warrior classes;</em></li>
<li><em>In AE Shatranj, there is a heavy emphasis in character development along with interactions with environment and others. What AE Shatranj does is take this even further, integrating this aspect so that the experience feels more intimate;</em></li>
<li><em>the core of AE Shatranj itself is something that is mostly new to the industry, especially to the level/degree in which it drives all aspects of the game and series itself; The idea of twin flames and their miraculous bond is entirely new</em></li>
<li><em>The way in which players make their choices as the story progresses and how the choices/effects affects story, characters, and gameplay is also new to video games. I.e. in the way it is done in AE Shatranj.       </em></li>
<li>
<em>The level and manner in which martial arts is interweaved into AE Shatranj and The entire Aeternus Eternus series is something which hasn’t been done before i.e. not the way in which we have done so.</em>  </li>
</ul><p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: How else can backers helps us?</strong></p>
<p><em>A: Another way that would greatly help us is by spreading the word to as many people as you can thereby giving all of us here in Kamla Arts the chance to gain the funding and support we need to help us continue along our path in making the Aeternus Eternus universe alive for everyone to experience and enjoy. </em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em><br/></em><strong>Q: Rewards and Shipping?</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong><em>A: Rewards will be released when we are finished with post -production; the date listed is the estimated date when we expect to be done and ready for shipping. We will contact everyone any needed information through email and/or phone. When we are ready to ship, we will let everyone know the cost of shipping. Unfortunately we can't pay for shipping for everyone as much as we'd like to be able to but will add extra gifts as a thank you for you wonderful support. </em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><strong>Q: What is the art work? Why the Art work?</strong></p>
<p><em>A: The concept art in the title is a concept on the emotions and energy of Valkyrie –Valkyric Royal Knight – Fuyuko Freyja rather than on how she looks like. We thought we should mention this so as not to confuse the visual of AE Shatranj. We will upload the title art work with its other counterpart. Enjoy.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><em><br/></em>To the world, we thank you from our hearts and eagerly look forward to sharing the Aeternus Eternus Universe. </p>
<p>Sincerely, </p>
<p>Kamla Arts</p>

<p><strong><em>Update I –</em></strong> To further explain our approach; Taking the approach we chose has led us to a profound way of understanding The Aeternus Eternus World. First, it has greatly helped us in understanding not just the lore and magic but the characters themselves thus allowing us to get a glimpse of what it is to feel the magic through them. This allowed us to come up with abilities that closely resonate with each type of guardian, The Spell Star, the Arc Magus, The Paladin and so forth. As a bonus, this also helped us in reinterpreting what an Arc Magus and Paladin are for example. We are uploading our first images which led us towards this path.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update II - </em></strong>We have decided on where we would like to go for the concept art for characters in AE, as soon as that’s done, we will upload some images for everyone to see.  </p></div>","Kamla Arts: AE Shatranj

                We as individuals have our own unique experiences, and it’s our choices that create the venture, which defines ourselves as we continue to learn and grow into the future. In Aeternus Eternus, players are able to make similar decisions and define their own venture or path. This also means there is no right path for any one player, what may be good for one player may not be as good for another. In other words, there are no good/neutral/bad choices, there are instead options provided that are a reflection of the expressions and uniqueness of that individual player, and making a choice that more reflects that character will have the best outcome. This not only allows more freedom and flow throughout their endeavor, it allows them to experience this through interactions and understandings with team mates and those encountered along the way. These experiences vary slightly with each player, and the choices made grant more depth into the further development of their character.
Core of Aeternus Eternus
The vastness of Aeternus Eternus is love, and all aspects are tied to that essence. Most especially, the love between twin flames and how their love forms, expresses, and identifies their identity as individuals and as two in one.
 When players fight, they do so alongside their beloved twin flame. They are accompanied with the many opportunities to learn, understand, interact, engage, and grow with their most beloved. In a sense, it is experiencing what it is to live and fight alongside your most precious one; Thus Player’s actions and movement are symbiotic with their mate. Their mate has their own actions and thoughts, yet still corresponds to the player’s, inspiring that feeling of intimacy in their most precious relationship.
We want the players to constantly keep answering questions such as:
What is that that matters most? Why is it that we fight? Strive? What do we live for?
Ultimately this gives a unique and fresh approach with personal traits, along with individual growth via your choices and relations. All of which are synonymous with love, the ways in which we experience and express ourselves within the virtual universe.
 
Questions: 
Q: Why are we asking for $2,350,000 when we need $2,180,000?
A: The additional $170,000 to the requested $2,180,000 is the estimated fee for using Indiegogo.com
 
Q: Why Flexible funding?
A: To continue on we need the full funding; flexible funding would guarantee us to finish pre-production and move on to production. Getting the full funding will allow us to go full forward all the way
 
Q: Where are we at as of now?
A: We have most of the design concept done; we need a few more team members to finish it, thereby completing pre-production. Afterwards with more members we can immediately start production, which brings us here to Indiegogo.com
 
Q: What game(s) is out there that is closest to AE Shatranj?
A:  AE Shatranj is a game that is new to the industry with original key mechanics in gameplay, story, and focus. As such it is very difficult to find something close to it that has already been done. With that said, the closest would probably have to be the following; Tales of the Abyss, Baldur’s Gate II: Shadows of Amn, Infinite Undiscovery, Kingdom Hearts, Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn, Final Fantasy XII, and the 2008 Prince of Persia. All of the games mentioned are great games, each offering something very enjoying that captures our hearts;

In Prince of Persia, the way Prince and Elika work so well with each other
Final Fantasy XII, the rich world filled with diversity
Kingdom Hearts, the appreciation of friendship and courage
Baldur’s Gate II: Shadows of Amn, the immense amount of lore and grand selection of customization
Tales of the Abyss, The quirky characters and the development of Luke’s relationship with Tear
Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn, the use of tactics and strategic play
Certain aspects of these wonderful games are shared in AE Shatranj.
 
Q: What is different about AE Shatranj and the AE world?
A: There are many key differences with AE Shatranj with which we'd like to keep secret for now, however there are some aspects which we can share; example,

AE Shatranj along with the Aeternus Eternus series itself has unique gameplay, original abilities for Guardians along with an original interpretation of warrior classes;
In AE Shatranj, there is a heavy emphasis in character development along with interactions with environment and others. What AE Shatranj does is take this even further, integrating this aspect so that the experience feels more intimate;
the core of AE Shatranj itself is something that is mostly new to the industry, especially to the level/degree in which it drives all aspects of the game and series itself; The idea of twin flames and their miraculous bond is entirely new
The way in which players make their choices as the story progresses and how the choices/effects affects story, characters, and gameplay is also new to video games. I.e. in the way it is done in AE Shatranj.       

The level and manner in which martial arts is interweaved into AE Shatranj and The entire Aeternus Eternus series is something which hasn’t been done before i.e. not the way in which we have done so.  
 
Q: How else can backers helps us?
A: Another way that would greatly help us is by spreading the word to as many people as you can thereby giving all of us here in Kamla Arts the chance to gain the funding and support we need to help us continue along our path in making the Aeternus Eternus universe alive for everyone to experience and enjoy. 
 
Q: Rewards and Shipping?
A: Rewards will be released when we are finished with post -production; the date listed is the estimated date when we expect to be done and ready for shipping. We will contact everyone any needed information through email and/or phone. When we are ready to ship, we will let everyone know the cost of shipping. Unfortunately we can't pay for shipping for everyone as much as we'd like to be able to but will add extra gifts as a thank you for you wonderful support. 
 
Q: What is the art work? Why the Art work?
A: The concept art in the title is a concept on the emotions and energy of Valkyrie –Valkyric Royal Knight – Fuyuko Freyja rather than on how she looks like. We thought we should mention this so as not to confuse the visual of AE Shatranj. We will upload the title art work with its other counterpart. Enjoy.
 
 
To the world, we thank you from our hearts and eagerly look forward to sharing the Aeternus Eternus Universe. 
Sincerely, 
Kamla Arts

Update I – To further explain our approach; Taking the approach we chose has led us to a profound way of understanding The Aeternus Eternus World. First, it has greatly helped us in understanding not just the lore and magic but the characters themselves thus allowing us to get a glimpse of what it is to feel the magic through them. This allowed us to come up with abilities that closely resonate with each type of guardian, The Spell Star, the Arc Magus, The Paladin and so forth. As a bonus, this also helped us in reinterpreting what an Arc Magus and Paladin are for example. We are uploading our first images which led us towards this path.
Update II - We have decided on where we would like to go for the concept art for characters in AE, as soon as that’s done, we will upload some images for everyone to see.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Cassie's Chaos (Tough Mudder Team)</h3>
<p>Cassie's Chaos team was set up earlier this year to take part in Tough Mudder (Scotland) to raise funds for Cassie McEwan. Cassie has CdLS (Cornelia de Lang Syndrome), which is a condition caused by a mutated gene.</p>
<p><br/>Last year Team Cassie raised over £12k for the CdLS Foundation and all the monies raised went directly to the foundation who support families of children affected by CdLS and also fund research into the condition.</p>
<p>This year we are raising funds for Cassie with a donation going to the foundation as well. Every child deserves the best their parents and family can provide when growing up – whether they have special needs or not. Cassie will need ongoing care and support as she gets older and her mum and Dad are constantly seeking new ways to improve Cassie's life. </p>
<p>The aim of this campaign is to help towards Cassie's ongoing needs like buying sensory lights for her room or even new shoes – her shoes are specially made as her feet are so small – let's face it, every little girl always needs new shoes!</p>
<p>We think it's a very worthwhile cause and we hope you do too. Please give generously!</p>
We've put a conservative estimate of £2k on what we hope to raise but it would be fantastic if your contributions took us over our goal. </div>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">The game you are looking at here will be something ... fun. I started this just because i wanted to create a small horror game for people to enjoy. It is hard nowadays to find good horror games that really live up to the expectations. Most just get stuck in development... stay a concept or a demo of some sort. That's why I decided a long time ago to make the world a better place and provide it with actually good horror games - Games that dont throw a jumpscare on you... play an overly loud sound... simply appear cheap and not well done.<br/><br/>But yeah... what can i say? ... I could not just leave my little game like that. I guess I am sort of a perfectionist. So that is why we are here. I need your help to make this game better than any other of my previous ones.</p>

Unfortunately i don't see myself in the position to spend a lot of money for gaming assets. I try to do as much as possible alone... model the assets myself, even though that is really taking a lot of time and effort.</p>

Sometimes i get a little bit of help from friends or my brother helps me out a bit if I need some better sounds or music.
 
The game you are looking at here will be something ... fun. I started this just because i wanted to create a small horror game for people to enjoy. It is hard nowadays to find good horror games that really live up to the expectations. Most just get stuck in development... stay a concept or a demo of some sort. That's why I decided a long time ago to make the world a better place and provide it with actually good horror games - Games that dont throw a jumpscare on you... play an overly loud sound... simply appear cheap and not well done.But yeah... what can i say? ... I could not just leave my little game like that. I guess I am sort of a perfectionist. So that is why we are here. I need your help to make this game better than any other of my previous ones.
 

The Game - Clockwise The game itself started as a tube of rooms... i wanted to create something similar to the well known and fun SCP-games. So that is where i started... and look where we are now.

You will find yourself in an endless row of rooms, hallways and other areas, while each room there is different for itself. You are basically in a giant... neverending ""haunted house"".There are puzzles, scares and unique happenings that you probably won't find in any other game. 


 
This is where you come to play I need your help to make this game even more unique. Even better than any of my previous ones were. With just a modest amount of money i will be able to include better models, meshes and all kinds of things that it takes to make this game the most enjoyable one you have played in a long time ago. Unfortunately i don't see myself in the position to spend a lot of money for gaming assets. I try to do as much as possible alone... model the assets myself, even though that is really taking a lot of time and effort.
 

What will happen? Where does my money go? All the funds collected will go directly into the game development process. It doesn't really matter how much you give... every little bit helps. A dollar could already be enough for me to implement a cool new piece of furniture. 
The whole campaign is about improving the game as much as possible. the more funds... the better the game will get.
 
You can't donate? No problem!
If you can't spend some money or don't want to, you're welcome to spread this campaign and/or follow me and the game on Twitter or Gamejolt.Also any feedback or comment helps a lot. :)Cheers, Fabian (pheenix93)",2.0,0,"3 Campaigns

Only 3,200 decks of this colour will be printed to reflect the number of tigers in the wild.  Today, you get to ""adopt"" your very own rare tigers designed by Edo Huang by pledging for a deck or two.

<h3><b>Quality</b></h3>

<p>We have worked closely with <a href=""http://lawrencesullivan.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lawrence Sullivan</a> from <a href=""http://legendsplayingcards.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Legends Playing Card Company</a> (LPCC) to print these cards to our specifications in Taiwan. LPCC has for the past few years produced world class playing cards that cardists, magicians and poker players adore; such as the highly sought after Legends #852 v.1 and v.2. Their traditionally cut European card stock has a great snap and feel, coupled with precise printing registration making really thin borders possible which look great in fans and spreads. Mantecore Playing Cards will feature LPCC's signature Diamond Finish which feels and handles wonderfully and lasts for a long time even in warm and humid weather where cards tend to clump easily. </p>

<h2>What We Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2>
<p>Enough about how the deck looks and feels. Here's why we need your help. For Mantecore to become a reality, we will need to raise $7,000 to print 3,200 decks, as well as ship them to you. As this is a fixed funding campaign, we won't be able to print the Mantecore Playing Cards if our goal of $7,000 is not met within 30 days. The upside though, is that you will be refunded after this 30 day period.</p>
<p>Once our goal has been reached, we would break even. I would then proceed to liaise with LPCC to get the cards printed to be shipped to you.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div> </div> <div> <h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2> <p> </p>
</div><div>
<span style=""line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;"">Our design is completed and ready for production. The main risk and challenge would be the production and fulfilment process once the project as been successfully funded. To help ease any hiccups during production we have already built a strong relationship with the representative at LPCC who will help with production and fulfilment. </span><span style=""line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;""><span style=""line-height: 26px;"">With LPCC handling shipping, you can have a peace of mind as your shipping costs are lowered as they are shipped straight from the source without any delay. I also have spent hours studying other successful and unsuccessful Playing Card projects by other creators that have gone before me to learn from their strengths and weaknesses.</span></span><br/>

However, just by helping us spread the word, you are helping us a great deed. You can help us by sharing this page via any sort of social media or word of mouth. Your help would be greatly appreciated by us as well as Panthera.

<h2><b>SHIPPING</b></h2>

</div></div>","MANTECORE PLAYING CARDS - INSPIRED BY  A CLASSIC, DESIGNED FOR THE MODERN GENERATION







Magicians, cardists or poker players-Mantecore Playing Cards will suit your needs. Mantecore sports an original and striking back design with custom aces, pips and court cards. These cards will also last longer than your average deck as they are printed by the good guys at Legends Playing Cards Company.




We have breathed new life into the classic back design, by redesigning everything from the backs to the pips from scratch but still kept the Rider Backs overall layout.




Mantecore was named as a tribute to magicians Siegfried and Roy's famous tiger. The tiger was chosen as the main theme for the deck because of my love of these majestic beasts. 




Rather than being just another deck of playing cards. We wanted to attach meaning and story to our deck. It is estimated that only 3,200 tigers are currently left in the wild. Thus, we have included a line on the side of the tuck that says ""Save the Tigers"", to increase awareness of the dwindling number of tigers due to poaching. Only 3,200 decks of this colour will be printed to reflect the number of tigers in the wild.  Today, you get to ""adopt"" your very own rare tigers designed by Edo Huang by pledging for a deck or two. Edo is an experienced graphic designer by day who has designed multiple sought after playing cards, such as the Nautical playing cards.


A portion of the funds collected will be donated to the Panthera's Save The Tiger Fund (http://www.panthera.org/node/1399). Your contribution helps define their stripes. 





We seek your support in making this idea a reality. You can click on one of the pledges to help us out, or scroll down to learn more on how the cards look like and a FAQ at the end. 

*Note: IGNORE INDIEGOGO'S PROMPT THAT THE DECKS WILL BE SHIPPED FREE TO YOUR LOCATION. Shipping is not free except for the uncut sheet perk. Please remember to add that to your order when you check out or I will not be able to ship the cards to you. Check out the shipping portion of the campaign down below for more details.



    The Cards

UPDATE: This is how all the cards would look like on an uncut sheet

Backs

The backs of the cards feature an intricate design inspired by one of the most classic back designs of all-time, the Rider Backs.











Every part of the design for the back of the cards have been carefully thought of. From how it looks in a fan, to when it is spread vertically and horizontally, as well as when it is spun on one finger. There are even areas for magicians to ""work their magic"".







Faces
Mantecore has custom pips (Spades, Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds) that have a fresh new look but are yet easily recognizable.



All 4 aces have a tiger interacting with the pip in the middle.





The court cards have been simplified and enlarged, taking inspiration from 2 of our favourite decks Smoke and Mirrors, and Magic Con 2012 by Dan and Dave. The simplified court cards have their faces tweaked to look younger. The borders that restrict the royals have also been removed. The colour of their clothing have been tweaked to match the colour scheme of the deck as well.




This decks features one joker that shows a lone tiger standing majestically atop a rock with a secret reveal (not pictured) that allows you to produce miracles.



Extras
You will get double backer that opens endless possibilities for magic effects.
 
Check out the gallery section for more pictures of the prototype deck in action.

Quality

We have worked closely with Lawrence Sullivan from Legends Playing Card Company (LPCC) to print these cards to our specifications in Taiwan. LPCC has for the past few years produced world class playing cards that cardists, magicians and poker players adore; such as the highly sought after Legends #852 v.1 and v.2. Their traditionally cut European card stock has a great snap and feel, coupled with precise printing registration making really thin borders possible which look great in fans and spreads. Mantecore Playing Cards will feature LPCC's signature Diamond Finish which feels and handles wonderfully and lasts for a long time even in warm and humid weather where cards tend to clump easily.

What We Need & What You'll Get
Enough about how the deck looks and feels. Here's why we need your help. For Mantecore to become a reality, we will need to raise $7,000 to print 3,200 decks, as well as ship them to you. As this is a fixed funding campaign, we won't be able to print the Mantecore Playing Cards if our goal of $7,000 is not met within 30 days. The upside though, is that you will be refunded after this 30 day period.
Once our goal has been reached, we would break even. I would then proceed to liaise with LPCC to get the cards printed to be shipped to you.

   Risks & Challenges  

Our design is completed and ready for production. The main risk and challenge would be the production and fulfilment process once the project as been successfully funded. To help ease any hiccups during production we have already built a strong relationship with the representative at LPCC who will help with production and fulfilment. With LPCC handling shipping, you can have a peace of mind as your shipping costs are lowered as they are shipped straight from the source without any delay. I also have spent hours studying other successful and unsuccessful Playing Card projects by other creators that have gone before me to learn from their strengths and weaknesses.
  Other Ways You Can Help We understand that not all of you will able to back this campaign. However, just by helping us spread the word, you are helping us a great deed. You can help us by sharing this page via any sort of social media or word of mouth. Your help would be greatly appreciated by us as well as Panthera. It would be my dream to see this project become a reality and these decks in the hands of magicians, cardists and poker players worldwide.


SHIPPING
THIS PART IS VERY IMPORTANT IF YOU ARE BACKING THIS PROJECT
Shipping is NOT free to anywhere in the world. However, we have made shipping as cheap and affordable to everyone by working with LPCC for fulfilment.
We do understand that shipping can be expensive if there is a fixed international shipping cost. We have thus broken it down to a few regions to help cut the cost on your end. Simply enter the shipping amount that corresponds to the number of decks you have pledged as a custom amount additional gift after the pledge,then click on ""Continue to Payment"" to send in the amount and we will take care of the rest.

The final product may vary slightly from the photos and video. What you see in the pictures is very close to what you will get in the final product.

<li>
<b>Innovative</b> - With its easy to use Modular design system MMO Lab makes creating complex and varied games a more straightforward process and not a frustrating impossibility.</li>
<li>
<b>User Friendly</b> - Our driving goal is to provide solutions to the problems facing prospective game developers and to use what we've learned from our own early game dev experiences to provide a system that's easy to use but also has the power to build the games you want.</li>

<li>
<b>Adaptable</b> - Unlike other systems, MMO Lab supports an unlimited number of game genres and gives users unmatched control over game content, game mechanics and gameplay.</li>
<li>
<b>Community</b> - Games depend on their players, MMOs especially. As anyone who has played an MMO can tell you half the fun comes from the relationships you build in game, and we see no reason that shouldn't extend outside of the games as well. Which is why we're committed to building a <b>strong community</b> through our Hub. With our Forum and Direct Messaging services it will be easy to stay connected no matter how many games you're playing on our system. Not to mention that all the games published on our Hub will have <b>instant access</b> to thousands of players alongside fellow game developers.</li>

</div></div>","Chosen Space was originally launched back in 2006 and developed an enthusiastic and dedicated player base. In the eight years since then Chosen Space has been through a few different versions but is now showing its age.We think it's high time Chosen Space was relaunched with brand new graphics and improved gameplay and features. We've developed our own Game Engine called MMO Lab which will allow us to finally make the Chosen Space we've always imagined, and which the players have always deserved.We've recently finished a successful KickStarter campaign and have had several people contact us about supporting Chosen Space but who weren't able to use the KickStarter payment system. So we've decided to set up this IndieGogo campaign as the simplest and quickest way for those people to support Chosen Space and have access to all the great backer rewards that were previously had on offer.Chosen Space is an MMO RPG/Strategy space game where players are given command of their own ship and let loose into a vast galaxy of star systems and planets. Not only are players given a whole galaxy to explore and live in, they can do so almost however they like. Chosen Space supports numerous playstyles; users can haul cargo, mine asteroids, hunt bounties, carry passengers even vie for domination over planets or the Galaxy itself.

A living, sandbox, Galaxy constantly responding to Player Actions


Supports diverse play-styles and professions

All new Strategy and RPG elements
Incredible ship customization
Thousands of unique planets to colonize, trade with or control
A Galaxy of over 15 million grids to explore and secrets to discover.
Harking back to classic, early, text-based strategy and RPGs, Chosen Space is focused on providing entertaining and absorbing gameplay.An easy to use interface with relatively simple controls is in reality a powerful tool that lets you explore and manipulate an entire sandbox galaxy.hosen Space offers players great depth of gameplay. You can immerse yourself in the political intrigues between players as they fight for their Faction or Planet to come out on top. Or spend time putting together the perfect Starship, choosing the best components, fine tuning parts and squeezing that last bit of energy out of your reactor.

Play as casually or as intensively as you like, just dipping in now and then as you please or obsessively waiting for that next Action Point.
Chosen Space also has a strong focus on community. You won't be alone out there. You'll be sharing the Galaxy with thousands of other players each with their own goals and ambitions. It's up to you to decide how you interact with each other, join a pre-existing faction or make your own, go it alone, the choice is yours. Deadly rivalries, unbreakable alliances; that's just week one!The game is completely free to play, with no subscription or pay walls to premium content. Players will be able to purchase an in-game currency to speed up acquisition of the larger in-game assets. However the game has been carefully balanced so that pay to win scenarios cannot occur. Players will be able to buy the currency from each other in-game, meaning good players will have access to all the in-game currency they need.
Chosen Space is full of great features designed to give players as much freedom as possible and tons of different game play styles to explore.
Asteroid Bases - Carve yourself out a safe haven among the stars in your very own Asteroid. A launching pad for pirate raids or just somewhere to relax.
Spacelanes - Navigate your way across the Galaxy using ever shifting Spacelanes. Scout out faster routes through unexplored regions of space or stick to the busier, safer paths.
Mining - Carefully excavate Asteroids for their precious minerals of just blast them and see what falls off. Or risk your ship to mine the stars themselves, extracting Dark Matter from Neutron Stars.
Trading - Traverse the Spacelanes between Systems in search of the best trade deals in the quiet life of a merchant. Or add some danger to your life as a blockade running smuggler.
Planetary Ruler - Overthrow governments and put yourself in their place. Fight to become the most powerful Ruler in your System, your Sector, even the entire Galaxy.
Starships - Choose between a range of small craft ideal for scouting/exploration or slipping past blockades, mid-sized Starships perfect for battle or hauling cargo between Systems, or huge Capital Ships capable of projecting power across the entire Galaxy.

Any good Space MMO game needs a universe that feels alive and bustling. It has to feel like a real place with a million adventures just waiting to be had and incredibly rich locations just begging to be explored. That's the kind of Galaxy we want to give players in Chosen Space one where they feel they can fly off in any direction and find something exciting or new.



Part of the beauty of the game never resetting and being a persistent universe is that it develops a rich history and character all of its own. Where it feels like other people are out here with you and you can stumble across some old wrecked ship or long abandoned asteroid base and wonder what their story was. We're already building on a community with over eight years of history but it's great that we can include more ways for that to be reflected in-game.


We're really striving to make it so that players actions will have real and meaningful results for the game. Even the smallest actions will have impact and will help to shape the galaxy. One of the most overt of these is the new Colonisation mechanic. This will allow players to transport willing colonists to uninhabited systems in the galaxy to establish whole new planets. The Galaxy will expand and grow over time as more people join the game and set off into the wild frontier to establish new communities out there. The Galaxy is going to feel wild and untamed at the edge of civilised space, far from rescue.




MMO Lab is a platform we’ve developed that allows anyone to create their own browser based MMO game using a simple graphical interface, without needing a background in programming. It's like WordPress for games.



Once your game is created any member of our community hub can play it, giving the games access to a large pre-existing potential player base.
The MMO Lab platform is designed to be as simple to use as possible so that even people with no technical skills can bring their vision to life. This is a guiding principle throughout our entire design; usability and clarity are key. We want people to be able to build really complex games by taking small, easily understood steps using a Modular system to gradually build up. The end result should be a game that when viewed as a whole is complex but is created by combining numerous simple parts.



Early version of MMO Lab showing Chosen Space interface being modified


Innovative - With its easy to use Modular design system MMO Lab makes creating complex and varied games a more straightforward process and not a frustrating impossibility.

User Friendly - Our driving goal is to provide solutions to the problems facing prospective game developers and to use what we've learned from our own early game dev experiences to provide a system that's easy to use but also has the power to build the games you want.




Adaptable - Unlike other systems, MMO Lab supports an unlimited number of game genres and gives users unmatched control over game content, game mechanics and gameplay.

Community - Games depend on their players, MMOs especially. As anyone who has played an MMO can tell you half the fun comes from the relationships you build in game, and we see no reason that shouldn't extend outside of the games as well. Which is why we're committed to building a strong community through our Hub. With our Forum and Direct Messaging services it will be easy to stay connected no matter how many games you're playing on our system. Not to mention that all the games published on our Hub will have instant access to thousands of players alongside fellow game developers.



We've self-funded the project so far and have reached an Early Alpha stage. Large sections of the game are already built and functioning, though not yet at the point they could be reliably used by players.We've also been chatting with the players of the current version of Chosen Space, canvassing them for ideas about how to improve gameplay and what kind of features they'd like to see added. Or in some cases removed; explosive space mines seem to be almost universally despised and have undergone a fair bit of redesigning. So far it's been a really useful discussion.
This sort of responsive developer culture is exactly the kind of thing we hope MMO Lab will help cultivate. Being able to chat with your prospective or current players about what they like in a game can go a long way to improving things. It's very easy to come at game design from the mindset of a developer and somewhat forget about the player experience. A vocal and creative playerbase is an absolute gift to game designers and should not be squandered.



The present schedule is a conservative one so as to ensure we can deliver things on time and not be too thrown out by unforeseen setbacks.



 Take a look at the great perks that are on offer to Backers. Don't forget you can transfer the Add-Ons if you want to gift someone a Starship or an early access key.


This is the Meteor, the standard Starter Ship available to all players when they join the game. It's small but versatile and will be a loyal companion as you take your first steps into the Galaxy.



All perks after ""Colonist"" will receive the Stingray, an exclusive Starter Ship. It's bigger and better than the Meteor and will let you start the game in style. If you'd like a different Starter Ship you can find some cool additional choices in the Add Ons section below.







 Can’t decide which perk to back? Why not create your own? We’ve got a lot of awesome perks, so we’ll let you cherry-pick your own.
During check out, manually add the correct amount to your total pledge. We'll then contact you within 24 hours to find out which add-ons you want. Please note that some add-ons are limited and they will be given out on a first come first serve basis.
Early Access - Keys can be purchased for another user


Starter Ship - Limited to one per user. If you have not selected a perk or your perk does not include the 'String Ray' Starter Ship then add $8 to the price of each ship.


Unique Items - Limited to one per user


Virtual Currency - Can be used within any of the games created on MMO Lab.


Other amounts are available upon request

<p>This game is set in a global format, where you get to travel

<p>At the beginning of each turn you automatically battle your
country opponent with RO-SHAM-BO. If you beat this opponent, then you
automatically advance to a bronze medal and pass the level and potentially move
on. Then you get three options of how you are going to play. First we have just
basic bubble popping skills, where you match each item above with what you are
battling with (i.e. rock would match with rock). This is very typical of many
bubble matching games and can bring hours of enjoyment. When you feel like
doing something more challenging, you can go to the “Battle Mode”. This is
where your same rock will kill the lizard as well as crush the scissors. This
no longer just matching, but a challenging adventure as you learn how both the
lizard and Spock are used along with rock, paper, and scissors to battle. The
same level can now be played again but with a twist. <br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/986145/files/20141104131712-Level_Tmp2_sm.jpg?1415135832"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>Beyond the modes and features of the game you also have the option of

<h2>Who the flip are we?</h2>
<p>Our name is Pixelz, we are a small team working as hard as we can with the time and the room we have to polish and make this game as good as possible. My name is Raphael Fortin, I am the game designer and creator of this title. I am also teaching video game at a popular school here in Montreal. I have been doing so for the past two years. </p>
<p>Coop is a game I designed during the summer. I created a small prototye and then i got a lot of feedback about it so I decided to make it our first priority. We started working on it in December 2012.</p>
<p>Since our goal is just to finally see our game release and being played by the community, all we need is your help to gather just enough money to rent a real studio (because right now we are working on Skype...I know...), and get better hardware and make this project our main focus.  </p>
<p>You don't need money to make a game, you need a place, a team, time, passion and talent. We have all that except the place to work and the big machines!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Why do we need money again?</h2>
<p>Like I explained above, the money that we require is only to make this game even more possible. We are already working on it, with or without money we want this game to be released. The money we will receive will be invested in renting a space where we could all work instead of using online sharing tool and skype, it will be used to buy new hardware, software licenses and more.</p>
<h3>What happens if we get more than we actually need?</h3>
<p>My second personnal goal as a entrepreneur here in Montreal is to create a place where graduated 3d artist without a job could go and work with other people on projects or simply improve their portfolios. So basically I would use the extra money to buy extra hardware, licenses and everything and I'd make this place live.<br/><br/>During my 2 years of experience as a teacher I've noticed that a single year of study was not actually enough to have a solid portfolio for the industry. Sometimes you just need the extra 2-3 months to polish your portfolio but you don't have enough time, or money nor help. So my goal would be to help them out by making this place where they could get help, friends, hardware and then improve their chances to get a job.</p>
<strong><span style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">Ok...But what is this game?</span></strong>
</div>
<div>
<p>Coop is a third person Puzzle-Adventure game where you need to swap between 2 robots to solve the puzzle and go through the game.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I'd love to say much more about it but I don't want to spoil the story nor the game. </p>

<h3>Help Us Complete and Release ""Lords And Heroes"" - an Independent Massive Multiplayer Online Game for the iOS Platform that Combines Strategy and RPG Genres in a Unique Way</h3>
<p><em>Hello Everyone!</em></p>
<p>We are an independent startup and this game has been our dream and passion during the last 2 years. We have been self-funding it so far using mainly our revenue from freelancing but it's been pretty slow and earning money involved a lot of distraction.</p>
<p>Now that we have an alpha version we are on the right way to release and need to make the final leap!</p>
<p><strong>Gameplay Video -</strong> <a href=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=hCpU9HaerVQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://youtube.com/watch?v=hCpU9HaerVQ</a></p>

<h3>If this campaign is successful we will stop bothering about money and have it released within 4 months!</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>We have already invested 2 years of work and a whole lot of cash into this game. The story and the lore is being worked through, game engine is 90% ready, many game assets are ready too.</p>
<p>We have recorded an original soundtrack live with a power metal band ""Cherny Kuznets"" featured by performers from St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra.</p>
<p>We have even recorded a live action intro video with members of our team and local LARP community - which was an exciting fun project (please see attached media gallery and our YouTube channel).</p>
<p>And of course see our pitch video for how the gameplay now looks!</p>
<p>We are very excited with what we have achieved but it is not yet enough.</p>
<p><em>What we still need:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Add more assets (weapons, armor, creatures etc)</li>
<li>Add some missing engine features</li>
<li>Tweak balance thoroughly - both battles and economy</li>
<li>Wrap it up for beta testing and then for release</li>
<li>Set up production game servers worldwide - since we need a good ping for battles we plan for at least 4 regions (US East Coast, US West Coast, Europe, Asia)</li>

<p>We fully realize this classic approach may reduce our revenues but we are ready to sacrifice revenues in favor of gameplay! Fortunately we have no big publishers behind us who would force us to use freemium model.</p>

VALHALL — a multiplayer Viking first & third person Hack and Slash game with a skill-based free-flowing combat system.
 

 
Real-time collision

 

 
Play as from the first person view as well 3rd

 

Also, don't worry about third-person peeking.

 
During the Early Access there will be NO Third-person peaking feature implemented.

 

Get incredible emotions with in-game real-time voice chat - you can talk to your opponent or his dead body. This feature is working in a close radius of your character.    
That will fill your combat experience with new epic & fun moments. Tell to your opponent's face all what do you think about him - wish him good luck or tell how soon his spirit will leave this battlefield.
We hope that this option will fill your game experience with a good quantity of realism from any in-game contact.


is just the first game mode

We have bigger plans on this game
