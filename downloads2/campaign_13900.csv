<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>I'm an aspiring stand up comedian native to the Bay Area looking to expand on a national level.  Upon my graduation from SJSU, I have fallen upon hard times.  I've been unemployed over 18months and had to move back in with my parents in an area outside the comedy scene until I get back on my feet.  Although my finances are in turmoil, I never stopped chasing my dream, no matter how far I have to travel to perform.  I recently advanced to the Quarter Finals of the Laughing Skull Comedy Fesitval, but I am short the funds to make the trip.  I would love to compete in this contest but I can't afford the trip, and that is why I need your help.<br/></p>

<p>We'd like to think that we're a special breed of improvisers.  Not many teams are dong musical improv.  It's rare, it's challenging and it's incredibly fun.  Our team really brings that fun and joy to our audiences.  After meeting in a class, taught by Tara Copeland, we had an immediate bond and decided to build on these friendships by starting a team together.  It's not only been a pleasure to improvise and sing together BUT in the short time we've performed together, we have been invited to play in several improv shows, the LA Indie Improv Festival and The Del Close Marathon.</p>
<p>However, we're still at the very early stages where income is not plentiful.  This is indeed the nature of the beast when you are a performer, a beast which we are willing to face daily so to pursue our passions.  But it certainly would be nice if we could expand on our dream of doing comedy in New York with other great comedians and improvisors.  More exposure is absolutely what we at Meaningful Touch truly need.  By performing in the Del Close Marathon, we will be opening those doors that have allowed the likes of Jimmy Fallon, Tina Fey and Kristin Wiig to enter.  it is a special opportunity.</p>
<p>I know you may be saying - there are tons of improv troupes and comedy teams out there.  Why should I help this one?  And I can only answer that by saying - we're special.  I don't know how else to put it, but when you come across those few moments in life that feel like pure synchonity, you have to take them and run with them.  After being in several comedy troupes my entire adult life, I can honestly say that I've never been involved in one so generous, caring, kind, considerate and hilariously funny.  Our team is just that - a team.  Like a lot of comics, we don't grandstand, step in each other's way or use this opportunity to leap frog over the other guy to reach the goal.  We want to reach the goal together.</p>
<p>We're estimating that we need approximately $10,000 (we're only asking for $5,000).  This would cover airfare for eleven people as well as accommodations.  Also, if you can't offer up a contribution, lodgings would be good too!  </p>

<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1237.photobucket.com/albums/ff464/KingOfSafari/header_comic.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/>""The Super-Gay Adventures of Ross Boston"" (or SGARB, for short) is an LGBT-friendly, all-ages webcomic available to read free on the web.  It follows the tale of a chubby ex-pizza-guy-turned-adventurer and his quest to protect the downtrodden monster citizens of the comic's setting.  He has the help of a sassy gay beast, an 80's workout video instructor, a super secret ex-spy, and their boss, a whimsical wizard.  Currently, it updates every Friday, and as of the start of this campaign, the first episode is very nearly finished.  <a href=""http://supergayadventures.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Go on and read it!</a><br/><br/>Episode 2 of SGARB picks up days after the end of the first story arc.  Having just been hired by Wizard Wayne to join the Bobslist Adventure Team, timid Ross desperately seeks the approval of his fellow adventurers.  In his search, he accepts a challenge from a shady drag queen/wizard who claims to have helpful information on the mysterious ""Freedom Nightmare.""</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1237.photobucket.com/albums/ff464/KingOfSafari/header_campaign.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>My name is <a href=""http://drew-green.tumblr.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Drew Green</a> and I'm an Atlanta-based illustrator and comic artist.  Currently, I'm self-employed and I make a meager living doing commissions and freelance, but I'd like to change that with your help, through this campaign.  With enough funding (the proposed $5,000), I can make my webcomic my full-time job.  I can work on it Monday through Friday - and weekends when necessary - using the funds provided by you to keep my life afloat.  Additionally, the funds will go to comic-related business;  i.e., funding the website, advertising, and conventions.<br/><br/>To be clear, if this campaign is funded, I'm not going to rest on my laurels.  Focusing on my comic in such a concentrated manner will be immensely rewarding and usually enjoyable, but it will probably also be the hardest thing I've ever done, creatively.  I plan to write, draw, ink, and color about 55 pages of content in about 4 months, so you can imagine what kind of undertaking this really is.<br/><br/>What are the benefits of funding this campaign?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>An increased update schedule -</strong>  Since I'll be working on the comic almost exclusively, I'll be able to post more than one page a week, as is the current update schedule.  This means you won't have to wait a year just to read 55 pages of content.</li>
<li>

<p>Thank you for taking a look at my campaign!  I appreciate every single dollar of every donation, and every share on twitter, tumblr, facebook, whatever.  I hope you'll help out and in any case, I look forward to creating Episode 2 of SGARB!</p></div>","Help the second episode of the LGBT-friendly all-ages webcomic, The Super-Gay Adventures of Ross Boston, happen faster and better!

""The Super-Gay Adventures of Ross Boston"" (or SGARB, for short) is an LGBT-friendly, all-ages webcomic available to read free on the web.  It follows the tale of a chubby ex-pizza-guy-turned-adventurer and his quest to protect the downtrodden monster citizens of the comic's setting.  He has the help of a sassy gay beast, an 80's workout video instructor, a super secret ex-spy, and their boss, a whimsical wizard.  Currently, it updates every Friday, and as of the start of this campaign, the first episode is very nearly finished.  Go on and read it!Episode 2 of SGARB picks up days after the end of the first story arc.  Having just been hired by Wizard Wayne to join the Bobslist Adventure Team, timid Ross desperately seeks the approval of his fellow adventurers.  In his search, he accepts a challenge from a shady drag queen/wizard who claims to have helpful information on the mysterious ""Freedom Nightmare.""
My name is Drew Green and I'm an Atlanta-based illustrator and comic artist.  Currently, I'm self-employed and I make a meager living doing commissions and freelance, but I'd like to change that with your help, through this campaign.  With enough funding (the proposed $5,000), I can make my webcomic my full-time job.  I can work on it Monday through Friday - and weekends when necessary - using the funds provided by you to keep my life afloat.  Additionally, the funds will go to comic-related business;  i.e., funding the website, advertising, and conventions.To be clear, if this campaign is funded, I'm not going to rest on my laurels.  Focusing on my comic in such a concentrated manner will be immensely rewarding and usually enjoyable, but it will probably also be the hardest thing I've ever done, creatively.  I plan to write, draw, ink, and color about 55 pages of content in about 4 months, so you can imagine what kind of undertaking this really is.What are the benefits of funding this campaign?


An increased update schedule -  Since I'll be working on the comic almost exclusively, I'll be able to post more than one page a week, as is the current update schedule.  This means you won't have to wait a year just to read 55 pages of content.

Improvements to the story, writing, and art - With more time to devote to the comic, I'll be able to expand on the characters and situations, and the comic will look even better if I don't have other projects to distract me.

The SGARB website - You and I won't have to worry about the website ceasing to exist for lack of funds to keep it running.

Really awesome perks - Just look below and you'll see all of the great things being offered here!

Support the arts - by donating to this campaign, you'll be supporting a unique art form:  independant comics.  Additionally, consider it a moral contribution to the LGBT movement, as I seek to use my comic to help boost visibility of gay characters in popular culture and media.

Create a success story - everybody loves a success story in webcomics, rare though that might be.  Help create one!

<p><em>Anatomy Of War</em> is a comic that is near and dear to me because it is about a young man that is suddenly diagnosed with cancer. He's completely healthy and then life throws him a curve ball that he just isn't ready for. The other main character is a peaceful man that believes his every conflict can be worked out peacefully.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>   My name is Ken Austin, I am an aspiring comic book artist and creator of Haven Knights. I am currently on active duty with the US Army and a friend and I created a story that has now become Haven Knights. </p>
<p>   My campaign is is designed to open up into several venues starting with what I really hope turns into an epic storyline that lasts over hundreds of issues and then moves on into a multi-player online video game, and maybe one day a feature film.</p>
<p>    The campaign is important to me because a friend of mine that I was stationed with in Germany many years ago helped to inspire the story and asked that I turn the idea into a comic book after seeing some of my sketches. My friend passed away last year after a health issue that I won't go into detail about. I have dedicated the book to him and have given him credit for the story which I will continue to do as the book progresses into later issues.</p>
<p>   Your contributions will assist me with production costs for printing, and hopefully blossom into something larger such as hiring comic book industry artists to take part in the future construction of more issues of Haven Knights. I have already networked with a few industry artists whom I now consider friends, one of which was Adam Street who actually did the colors for issues 1 and 2, and remains a friend and mentor as I progress through additional Haven Knights comic art.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>   I am asking for people to assist me to get funded for $1500 initially. This amount will most importantly pay for the estimated $700 for printing. Additional expenses are all estimated but will include $50 promotional art prints, $50 for 11X17 comic art boards to product the artwork which will also be available as original art later, $150 for art supplies most of which is for art inking pens, $200 for shipping of rewards (Estimated from the last 2 projects run from Kickstarter), and lastly approximately $350 for custom commission artwork from industry artists to help provide the book a little kick of comic credibility. If the project does not get fully funded or achieves over-funding which I have witnessed from some projects, the funds will still be applied toward the printing costs and hiring industry professionals for future issue work. I will not be making a profit on this book.</p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>   The most important impact your contributions will make is that this issue and hopefully future issues will not take 6 months to a year just to produce. The first issue took nearly 15 years to fully complete and ready it for production, issue 2 was right behind it and took almost 11 months to complete, and I have now been working on issue 3 for almost 12 months. Funding would allow me the opportunity to really hire a few more people to get this book out faster and more regularly.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>   One initial challenge was assembling a comic book from start to finish which I had no idea how to do until I tackled the first project. I have since acquired a degree in project management including several courses that were comic book specific which enabled me to adjust for planning.</p>
<p>   There aren't too many risks involved in this project, my main goal from the beginning was to ensure that the hobby paid for itself. I made a vow that I would not get in over my head by purchasing supplies or services unless the funds were available. If there is no funding there is no comic book. I would hate to see the latter happen, I really do have mass amounts of content to unload unto the world.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>   The biggest problem with past projects has been social media. If you cannot contribute monetarily that is okay, what I would ask for at a minimum is that you log on to your Facebook account since I am sure we all possess one and give my page The Tenth World Comics a ""Like"", share the page with your friends and family too. I will make regular posts on my page there since past reports have shown that Facebook provided the most contact and contribution sources. If you share those posts with your friends and family my product could potentially reach more people.</p>

Additional expenses are all estimated but will include $50 promotional art prints, $50 for 11X17 comic art boards to product the artwork which will also be available as original art later, $150 for art supplies most of which is for art inking pens, $200 for shipping of rewards (Estimated from the last 2 projects run from Kickstarter), and lastly approximately $350 for custom commission artwork from industry artists to help provide the book a little kick of comic credibility. If the project does not get fully funded or achieves over-funding which I have witnessed from some projects, the funds will still be applied toward the printing costs and hiring industry professionals for future issue work. I will not be making a profit on this book.   The Impact    The most important impact your contributions will make is that this issue and hopefully future issues will not take 6 months to a year just to produce. The first issue took nearly 15 years to fully complete and ready it for production, issue 2 was right behind it and took almost 11 months to complete, and I have now been working on issue 3 for almost 12 months. Funding would allow me the opportunity to really hire a few more people to get this book out faster and more regularly.
    Risks & Challenges    One initial challenge was assembling a comic book from start to finish which I had no idea how to do until I tackled the first project. I have since acquired a degree in project management including several courses that were comic book specific which enabled me to adjust for planning.
   There aren't too many risks involved in this project, my main goal from the beginning was to ensure that the hobby paid for itself. I made a vow that I would not get in over my head by purchasing supplies or services unless the funds were available. If there is no funding there is no comic book. I would hate to see the latter happen, I really do have mass amounts of content to unload unto the world.
    Other Ways You Can Help    The biggest problem with past projects has been social media. If you cannot contribute monetarily that is okay, what I would ask for at a minimum is that you log on to your Facebook account since I am sure we all possess one and give my page The Tenth World Comics a ""Like"", share the page with your friends and family too. I will make regular posts on my page there since past reports have shown that Facebook provided the most contact and contribution sources. If you share those posts with your friends and family my product could potentially reach more people.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3><strong>Hi, I'm Lucas S G Fehr</strong></h3>
<div>
<p>I'm owner and creator at Lucworks. As a freelance illustrator for 6 years, I've made custom Greeting Cards for my clients and community, as well as character designs, backgrounds promotional posters and logos. Greeting cards are comics - at least the ones at Lucworks are.</p>
<p>I love Sci-Fi (being weened on <strong><em>Star Wars</em></strong>), Samurai Legends and Zombies. <strong>I LOVE Zombies!</strong> I have ever since I was briefly married to a Game Cube and fell totally immersed in <strong><em>Resident Evil</em></strong> one winter.</p>
<p>Though I'm sometimes scared to death by the real challenges that face humanity, I ultimately have faith in life, the spirit of compassion and the appreciation of finding truth that will guide us in our greater understanding of the universe and the big WOW. Call it my confirmation bias, but I have a feeling everything will be okay.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Our journey toward the Source is a fascinating mystery of ever growing awe</h3>
<p><span>in <strong><em>Zombie</em></strong><em> Planet</em>, zombies finally live up to their potential as a catalyst for planetary transformation! Insatiable consumption driven by fear is redeemed through the wheel of fire: a cycle of fear, attack, surender and transcendence.</span></p>
<p><span><span>A sci-fi horror comic is my humble contribution toward the goal of emancipating us from our fear of death. Do that with a comic book, you say? Befriend the wolf at your door and appreciate what you fear - ultimately it's just fantasy. And wolves these days are a bit less popular as scapegoats - so '<strong>befriending the zombie within</strong>' will galvanize humanity to meet the challenges that await us. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>What is it with zombies!?</span></span></p>
<h3>If nothing else, it'll be a grisly sci-fi horror comic that'll suck you in and creep you out!</h3>

<h3><span><span>I'm taking the colouring process to a level rarely realized in comics</span></span></h3>
<p>I'm lavishing each and every square panel with rich colour and detail. You'll be able skim through the story and enjoy the message or lose yourself in the myriad details; the book will provide multiple re-readings. So much stuff.</p>
<p>&lt;<em><strong>I LOVE STUFF&gt;</strong></em></p>
<p><span>Your investment can help me through the last leg of completing this ambitious project which has been in the works for the last 4 years.</span></p>
<p><span>Colouring the drawings: adding texture and depth (making it shine with light and pop out of shadow) is very time consuming. Each panel takes between 3 days and two weeks to colour. Volume one is inked and 20% coloured and the whole comic is 2/3 rds finished. </span></p>

Do you love zombies? How about when these delicious horrors swarm and feed (on fear and flesh) to be skillfully lopped to dripping bits (splish, splash) by some cool samurai hero? What if this scene were set in contrast to the greatest positive transformation collective consciouness can conceive of and about to go beyond?
I can hardly wait to share it with you!
 

Eyes on the Prize - The Love Warrior About to Hack and Slash

Hi, I'm Lucas S G Fehr

I'm owner and creator at Lucworks. As a freelance illustrator for 6 years, I've made custom Greeting Cards for my clients and community, as well as character designs, backgrounds promotional posters and logos. Greeting cards are comics - at least the ones at Lucworks are.
I love Sci-Fi (being weened on Star Wars), Samurai Legends and Zombies. I LOVE Zombies! I have ever since I was briefly married to a Game Cube and fell totally immersed in Resident Evil one winter.
Though I'm sometimes scared to death by the real challenges that face humanity, I ultimately have faith in life, the spirit of compassion and the appreciation of finding truth that will guide us in our greater understanding of the universe and the big WOW. Call it my confirmation bias, but I have a feeling everything will be okay.
 

A Planet Redeemed - Reeling in Harmony Careeming Through the Universe Toward Collective Bliss
 
Our journey toward the Source is a fascinating mystery of ever growing awe
in Zombie Planet, zombies finally live up to their potential as a catalyst for planetary transformation! Insatiable consumption driven by fear is redeemed through the wheel of fire: a cycle of fear, attack, surender and transcendence.
A sci-fi horror comic is my humble contribution toward the goal of emancipating us from our fear of death. Do that with a comic book, you say? Befriend the wolf at your door and appreciate what you fear - ultimately it's just fantasy. And wolves these days are a bit less popular as scapegoats - so 'befriending the zombie within' will galvanize humanity to meet the challenges that await us. 
What is it with zombies!?
If nothing else, it'll be a grisly sci-fi horror comic that'll suck you in and creep you out!
 

Sewer Scenario - The Love Warrior Approaches in Stealth
 
I'm taking the colouring process to a level rarely realized in comics
I'm lavishing each and every square panel with rich colour and detail. You'll be able skim through the story and enjoy the message or lose yourself in the myriad details; the book will provide multiple re-readings. So much stuff.
<I LOVE STUFF>
Your investment can help me through the last leg of completing this ambitious project which has been in the works for the last 4 years.
Colouring the drawings: adding texture and depth (making it shine with light and pop out of shadow) is very time consuming. Each panel takes between 3 days and two weeks to colour. Volume one is inked and 20% coloured and the whole comic is 2/3 rds finished. 
'Almost there. Almost there!'
 

 Story Drawer - Every Object Tells a Story in the Tale of Zombie Planet
 
I can't wait to share it with you!
With a little help I can immerse myself in monastic dedication, working full time to finish colouring volume 1. Zombie Planet will ultimately be a trilogy - but all things in good time....
At a full-time pace, I can share this story with you in a little over 2 years, by December 5, 2014. 
This is a flexible funding project because every contribution brings me closer to my goal: sharing with you a richly detailed horror story about zombies, transformation and transcendence.
I'm sure you will be pleased with the result. Art is our zeitgeist; seeing ourselves accepting our deepest horror and transcending it will have a liberating effect on our collective courage to be real heros in our own lives, for each other.

<h3><strong>Synopsis</strong></h3>
<p><strong>NODE is the story of a young girl who is locked inside a large city prison for supernatural/magical creatures. In this futuristic dystopian world, supernatural species have revealed themselves to the world. Instead of being embraced by society, they are locked up in large city prisons segregating them from the rest of the world. In the middle of this, a young girl is accidentally thrown into one of these cities. She is human, but she is the descendant of an ancient line of mystical fighters who use the energy of their zodiac signs for combat. Re-naming herself Node, the first story arc showcases her being hired to track down a loose nightmare in the sewer systems of the city. The nightmare’s power is to hurt people by making them relive their trauma. While she battles him, we see her origins as to how she got to the city. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Full of action, adventure, and amazing art, Node is a comic book for readers  ages of 10 and up. See the trailer for issue 1 above.</strong></p>
<h2><strong>Behind the story</strong></h2>
<h2>
<strong>Node </strong><strong>is my first endeavor as a creator to put out a full issue story arc. It is also the flagship title for my group Horizon Line Comics. </strong>Upon its initial conception, Horizon Line Comics was started to provide the type of stories that I felt weren't on the comic book shelves. Comic books have been a part of the pop culture landscape ever since the drawings on the cave, and their unique literature has influenced everything from fashion trends, major motion pictures, music, the creation of role models and mirror images we see in them. It has helped provide an identity to readers hungry for story. It is the goal of Horizon Line Comics to provide those stories for readers everywhere.</h2>
<h2><strong>The Funds</strong></h2>
<p>Every contribution supports the production of this series. Horizon Line Comics wants to create an enjoyable and entertaining experience with a visual impact on storytelling. This also helps struggling artist work towards the completion of an art goal.</p>
<p>I have found highly professional artists and technicians from pencilers, inkers, colorists, and more.  I believe in paying for their talents.  I don’t want all the hard work to stall because of funding issues. Bringing original storytelling and unique art to readers everywhere is my first priority.</p>
<p>Your contribution will help me to showcase not just this title, but lay the ground work for other titles that I would like to build. I want to make Horizon Line Comics a business that creators with unique voices can turn to. The money goes to help fund artists looking to showcase their work plus printing costs, advertising, marketing, supplies, and helping Horizon Line Comics afford conventions and comic related festivals to bring in as many readers as possible.</p>

<p>What will we do with the money? </p>
<p>All money raised will go toward production costs to make AJALA: WELCOME TO THE C.S.C. and to give supporters some cool rewards. But since this book is 100% creator-owned, there's no publisher's financing.  Our Indiegogo goal is enough to bridge the gap and get a copy of the book in the hands of readers in 4 months!  So if you enjoyed our past work, support creator-owned comics, and want to see AJALA: WELCOME TO THE C.S.C.  Become a reality; we have some great rewards for you.</p>
<p>Achieving our $15,000 goal will make a nice dent in the myriad of expenses involved in producing <em>AJALA. </em>This includes covering all of the costs involved in producing and delivering those sweet backer rewards, as well as some of the tools (both physical and digital) that we use in creating the book. If we exceed our goal we are likely to blow the additional money on Cool new rewards to thank all of our supporters and maybe a big dinner so we can reconnect with friends and family we will have to ignore during this campaign.</p>

<h3>HOW</h3>
<p>In September 2012, Kasi Jammeh found out what it was truly like to be a superhero.  Her friend, Sharyl McGrew joined her at the San Francisco Superhero Street fair and they created the characters Hawt Flash &amp; Solara.  Their characters were named: Hawt Flash - because Kasi started going through ""the change"" (Perimenopause), Solara - to continue with the theme of hotness.  It was an amazing time that was not supposed to end.</p>
<p>From that experience, was born the idea of a webcomic of The Adventures of Hawt Flash &amp; Solara.  Hawt Flash finds that she gets superpowers from her perimenopausal symptoms.  Together, these women figure out Hawt's powers, empower women AND fight crime!</p>

This comic aims to tell that story in a way that I hope is enjoyable and relatable. As well as covering my realisation, my coming out (including  a guide of do's and don'ts for any Allies out there), and all that jazz, the book is also about the stuff <i>after</i> that. Stuff like the conversations and reactions I've had with family and co-workers, being a bisexual in a ""straight"" relationship, and how hard it can be in general to figure out queer feelings in a heteronormative world. Although Bi folk make up a large part of the LGBT population, we don't tend to get a lot of acknowledgment (It can be hard to name even one character from TV who uses the word ""bisexual"" to describe themselves), or space to discuss our experiences. So I'm putting my story out there.

This comic aims to tell that story in a way that I hope is enjoyable and relatable. As well as covering my realisation, my coming out (including  a guide of do's and don'ts for any Allies out there), and all that jazz, the book is also about the stuff after that. Stuff like the conversations and reactions I've had with family and co-workers, being a bisexual in a ""straight"" relationship, and how hard it can be in general to figure out queer feelings in a heteronormative world. Although Bi folk make up a large part of the LGBT population, we don't tend to get a lot of acknowledgment (It can be hard to name even one character from TV who uses the word ""bisexual"" to describe themselves), or space to discuss our experiences. So I'm putting my story out there. Hopefully that's helpful to someone, even in a small way.Bi The Way is a personal story, but it's one that I aim to make accessible and enjoyable to folk of all genders and orientations. Maybe you'll get a new perspective on something, or relate to it from your own experiences. Hopefully it will also make you laugh!What Will It Look Like?Bi The Way will be 52 pages long and perfect bound, with dimensions  of 240x157mm.

Σε μια εποχή
όπου όλα μοιάζουν να γυρίζουν γύρω από τις μεγαλουπόλεις και την κουλτούρα
τους, ο Αποστόλης Ιωάννου εμπνέεται από την ανεπιτήδευτη αγάπη του για την
ελληνική ύπαιθρο και παράδοση, δημιουργώντας ένα graphic novel-φόρο τιμής στην παραμυθένια διάσταση
μιας πραγματικότητας που χάθηκε. 
ΤΟ ΧΩΡΙΟ
είναι ένα graphic novel 80 ασπρόμαυρων σελίδων που διηγείται μια απλή, όσο και
όμορφη ιστορία: Οι σχέσεις των νέων γενεών με τις παλαιότερες, μέσω εικόνων που αποτυπώνουν την ελληνική ηπειρωτική
φύση, την αρχιτεκτονική των χωριών της, τις αγροτικές και κτηνοτροφικές
εργασίες, τα πανηγύρια, τα παιδικά παιχνίδια, και –εν γένει- την ανεμελιά μιας
ζωής με πιο αργούς, πιο «ανθρώπινους» ρυθμούς. Μιας εποχής που πέρασε.«Αυτά που θέλω να πω, τα λέω μέσω
των εικόνων και μέσω των χαρακτήρων και όχι μέσω του σεναρίου. Το σενάριο είναι
δευτερεύον, απλά μια αφορμή, ένα ""απαλό"" και διακριτικό backround»

Αποτέλεσμα όχι μόνο της αγάπης του
δημιουργού του, αλλά και της εντατικής έρευνας που προηγήθηκε σε θέματα
λαογραφικού και φυσικού ενδιαφέροντος, ΤΟ ΧΩΡΙΟ είναι μια δουλειά που ζητά την
πολύτιμη βοήθειά σας για να ολοκληρωθεί και να τυπωθεί.
Ο δημιουργός
Ο Αποστόλης Ιωάννου γεννήθηκε στα Τρίκαλα,
όπου και διαμένει. Εικονογράφος και δημιουργός comics, έχει επίσης στο
ενεργητικό του εικονογραφήσεις για παιδικά και εκπαιδευτικά βιβλία, αφίσες
συναυλιών και εξώφυλλα δίσκων. Comics του έχουν
δημοσιευτεί σε ελληνικά fanzines (ΕVOL 2, FART 2), ενώ τo 2013, κυκλοφόρησε το
πρώτο μεγάλο, ολοκληρωμένο comic
του, ΒΑΘΥ ΔΑΣΟΣ (Comicdom Press). Το 2014 κυκλοφόρησε την ιστορία ΤΑ ΜΑΓΙΚΑ
ΒΕΛΑΝΙΔΙΑ και το πρώτο τεύχος του comic TO ΡΟΜΠΟΤ ΚΑΙ ΤΟ ΚΟΡΙΤΣΙ. Ένα τρισέλιδο
δείγμα από την επερχόμενη δουλειά του, ΤΟ ΧΩΡΙΟ, φιλοξενήθηκε στην έκθεση comics
και εικονογράφησης, Εν Αιθρία 5, στην Αθήνα, τη Θεσσαλονίκη και την Ίσπρα της
Ιταλίας, ενώ με δείγματα του ίδιου project
εκπροσώπησε την Ελλάδα στο 4ο Σαλόνι Κόμικς (Salonul
European De Banda Desenata) που πραγματοποιήθηκε στο Εθνικό Μουσείο Σύγχρονης
Τέχνης του Βουκουρεστίου.

<li>Hire a top class camera, lenses, lighting and a DOP</li>
<li>Pay for travel expenses, food and crew on location</li>
<li>Colouring and visual effects, no compromise!</li>
</ul><p>We can film a full episode and make a small number of promo and music videos to go with it, which, of course, Contributors will have VIP access to. Plus, we'll be able to document the adventure in video, photos and a diary along the way. If we get more than 30K, you can bet we'll be filming more episodes!</p><p><strong>New Books.</strong> The current generation of books is heavy, expensive even in bulk because of the image quality we demand, and costs a whole bunch to ship, but with this money we will finally have the clout to source high quality yet light books that will simultaneously save us huge amounts of wasted cost and lower the purchase price significantly for every fan. We will work with printing houses to deliver a product that at least lives up to the print and binding quality of the current generation, or even exceeds it, before making any commitments.

David H, Alexius and I have toyed with the idea of pairing the visuals with a sound-scape that seamlessly adds depth to, and progresses with, the main comic. This album is our first step on the road to realising that concept and because of that we had planned the whole thing out on a minute shoe-string budget. Five thousand dollars changes everything because it means we are free to hire performers to play and sing for us, spend more time creating, mixing and recording the work, and have the final product mastered by a professional, helping us truly achieve our vision and make this album the best it can be.</p><p>Besides all this we will continue to sweeten the deal with more bite-size mini-perks at various milestones on the way.*</p><p><strong>You can help us reach this most exciting of destinations by upgrading your perk or by getting your friends, colleagues and families involved through <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/ZeeCaptain"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: #66e;"">Facebook</a>, <a href=""https://twitter.com/#!/zeecaptein"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: #39e;"">Twitter</a> and <a href=""http://alexiuss.deviantart.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: #393;"">deviantArt</a>, among other places.

<a name=""nonsense"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>WHAT BE THIS NONSENSE?</h2><p>Just over a year ago we launched the first physical volume of <a href=""http://rom.ac"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: #e00;font-weight: normal;"">Romantically Apocalyptic</a>. It was self-published in Toronto and shipped out on an ad-hoc basis. Back then, we had a few thousand followers on Facebook and 800 thousand page views per month to the website. Now those numbers have gone up to 60 thousand, and four million, yet the physical books are still sent the same way: a few at a time, and with a frustrating wait if you happen not to live on the American continent!</p><p>Now, if you're a starving artist (and, needless to say, our little team consists mostly of starving artists...) you end up spreading yourself too thin, trying to meet demand with regular low-scale print runs while working your socks off to fulfil your boundless artistic ambition. This is where we are, and that's why we need your help.</p><p>We're asking for ten thousand dollars. With this we want to do a large scale print run of not only the original volume, but also volume two, which we have started selling at select comicons. Both are around 100 pages and contain significantly more content than that shown on the website alone. In addition, we have a live action series at the pre-production stage, which we want to kick into a higher gear, and, due to popular demand, we want to release an RA-inspired companion music album.</p><p><img alt=""CD"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ogonline.org/romanticallyapocalyptic/indiegogo/CD_slim.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h2 style=""color: #e00;"">WHAT DO I, AS A MINION, GET IN RETURN?</h2><p>If we reach our goal of ten thousand, we will have enough to do all of these things and send glorious trinklets of swag in return. If we didn't reach our goal, we'd have to compromise too much so this is an all-or-nothing adventure!</p><p><img alt=""adventure"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ogonline.org/romanticallyapocalyptic/indiegogo/Adventure_slim.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>There's a perk for everyone. For those devoted minions with less to spend, we're offering the entire first two volumes as a DRM-free PDF, so you can experience the full content of the books on-screen for your investment, without the extra cost of a physical copy. Further up the chain we're offering individually numbered CDs of the album, prints, greeting cards and even unique, custom artwork on top of the inevitable newly printed comic books.</p><p style=""color: #222;""><strong>Don't forget too that if we skyrocket through our initial goal of 10K, we have even more superlative ideas for ways we can give back to you, our community.</strong></p><h2 style=""color: #e00;"">ZEE IMPAKT</h2><p>Your contribution affects Romantically Apocalyptic in several delectable ways:</p><ul>
<li>The comic becomes self-sustaining and grows with its audience</li>

We can make them!We can improve our studio green-screen and photoshoot setup for better, more rapid comic creation!New to this and not sure what's going on? Read more here...OVER $30,000!Juicy thanks from Captein and his crew for helping us beat 30K!

We're so overwhelmed with the support and trust you've shown us that we have to admit we were wrong to set our ambitions so low. What we have heard from this weekend's manic pledge-fest (apart from that you're ravenous for cosplay outfits :D) is that you want us to do something really significant, you're ready for us to do it now, and you expect to come along for the ride![Captein's Facebook post above received 476 Likes and 24 delightful comments in just two hours]So, thank you for those messages, and for all your generous pledges so far. We're ready to take this much further with your continued help...Produce the live-action series.We guess it's plain why spending this much on the live-action will be beneficial to everyone, but here are some things we can do with the money:
Hire a top class camera, lenses, lighting and a DOP
Pay for travel expenses, food and crew on location
Colouring and visual effects, no compromise!
We can film a full episode and make a small number of promo and music videos to go with it, which, of course, Contributors will have VIP access to. Plus, we'll be able to document the adventure in video, photos and a diary along the way. If we get more than 30K, you can bet we'll be filming more episodes!New Books. The current generation of books is heavy, expensive even in bulk because of the image quality we demand, and costs a whole bunch to ship, but with this money we will finally have the clout to source high quality yet light books that will simultaneously save us huge amounts of wasted cost and lower the purchase price significantly for every fan. We will work with printing houses to deliver a product that at least lives up to the print and binding quality of the current generation, or even exceeds it, before making any commitments. Guarranteed.Awesome music. Behind the scenes we've been talking about and experimenting for a while on a companion soundtrack for RA. David H, Alexius and I have toyed with the idea of pairing the visuals with a sound-scape that seamlessly adds depth to, and progresses with, the main comic. This album is our first step on the road to realising that concept and because of that we had planned the whole thing out on a minute shoe-string budget. Five thousand dollars changes everything because it means we are free to hire performers to play and sing for us, spend more time creating, mixing and recording the work, and have the final product mastered by a professional, helping us truly achieve our vision and make this album the best it can be.Besides all this we will continue to sweeten the deal with more bite-size mini-perks at various milestones on the way.*You can help us reach this most exciting of destinations by upgrading your perk or by getting your friends, colleagues and families involved through Facebook, Twitter and deviantArt, among other places. We'll be doing our best to broaden our reach too and if we all pull together, we'll get there!Respect and gratitude, Oggy and the team. @theOggyb
WHAT BE THIS NONSENSE?Just over a year ago we launched the first physical volume of Romantically Apocalyptic. It was self-published in Toronto and shipped out on an ad-hoc basis. Back then, we had a few thousand followers on Facebook and 800 thousand page views per month to the website. Now those numbers have gone up to 60 thousand, and four million, yet the physical books are still sent the same way: a few at a time, and with a frustrating wait if you happen not to live on the American continent!Now, if you're a starving artist (and, needless to say, our little team consists mostly of starving artists...) you end up spreading yourself too thin, trying to meet demand with regular low-scale print runs while working your socks off to fulfil your boundless artistic ambition. This is where we are, and that's why we need your help.We're asking for ten thousand dollars. With this we want to do a large scale print run of not only the original volume, but also volume two, which we have started selling at select comicons. Both are around 100 pages and contain significantly more content than that shown on the website alone. In addition, we have a live action series at the pre-production stage, which we want to kick into a higher gear, and, due to popular demand, we want to release an RA-inspired companion music album.WHAT DO I, AS A MINION, GET IN RETURN?If we reach our goal of ten thousand, we will have enough to do all of these things and send glorious trinklets of swag in return. If we didn't reach our goal, we'd have to compromise too much so this is an all-or-nothing adventure!There's a perk for everyone. For those devoted minions with less to spend, we're offering the entire first two volumes as a DRM-free PDF, so you can experience the full content of the books on-screen for your investment, without the extra cost of a physical copy. Further up the chain we're offering individually numbered CDs of the album, prints, greeting cards and even unique, custom artwork on top of the inevitable newly printed comic books.Don't forget too that if we skyrocket through our initial goal of 10K, we have even more superlative ideas for ways we can give back to you, our community.ZEE IMPAKTYour contribution affects Romantically Apocalyptic in several delectable ways:
The comic becomes self-sustaining and grows with its audience
The RA universe continues to expand into the video and audio realms
Eventually the team can travel to further reaches of the globe visiting pre-apocalyptic cities of residence, evangelising the whole world to Capteinism
Furthermore, after helping to bring RA to ever more people, you yourself will have acquired a piece of history: exclusive prints will indeed be exclusive - forever - and individually low-numbered CDs will proclaim to the world that you got there first. Heck, you could even be the proud owner of an original RA oil painting to display on the grandest wall in your house...And remember, if you pledge over a hundred dollars these books will have your name credited as a prized and esteemed contributor for all to see!MONEY TREES DO NOT GROW IN MY SURROUNDINGS, BUT I AM A LOYAL MINION.

<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;""><em>“By Page or by stage, my audience is my greatest Lover.” – Divinity Rose</em></span></p>
<p>Comedienne Divinity Rose is the girl of every nerd's dreams. She transforms from geeky single mom to multitalented performer and comes with her own accessories. Divinity's playfully funny observational comedy has made her an audience favorite. The Kentucky native ""wild ginger"" found herself crushing on comedians from a young age, sneaking to watch SNL and Red Dwarf while babysitting. Divinity began her comedy career in 2002 when she performed on the Lisa Lampinelli Show at Caroline's in New York City, and she's since shared the stage or screen with Nora Dunn, Dinky Gowen and countless others. When she isn't telling jokes or slinging her books at venues around the country, Divinity acts in films and writes for both stage and screen. Divinity has been heard on NPR and seen on the Syfy program ""Spooked,"" which may or may not be part of her master plan to compile the geekiest credits of all time.</p>
<p>Divinity has inspired the hearts and minds of many groups with her continual determination to follow her dreams and the willingness to share her trials and victories in the hopes of encouraging others in doing the same.  For years, people have predicted success for her and wanted to see what she could do with a real budget to work with, so now's their chance. She's floored people with her wit, moving words, energy, and determination for more than a decade producing and performing in over 500 shows, films,  and events providing work to hundreds of other writers and entertainers. After years of healing from traumatic events, she's found the power within to rise into something more. </p>

<p><strong style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">FUNDS:</strong></p>
<p>I've worked like mad for a long time and have come to a very exciting time where opportunities are presenting themselves, but I need help in order to take them.  Being a single mom means I can't go full Bohemian and live out of my car while I chase down my dreams and also means there's not a lot of money left over for things like recording or promotions. Being able to record a CD, finish my book, and make the rounds to perform will allow me to have more income to support my son and myself. The complete amount of funds needed to knock out all of my plans is hefty, so I'm breaking it into several cycles. Any excess during a cycle will go towards the next cycle.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s the list of things to pay for/accomplish in Phase 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Phase 1: 11 K</strong><em><br/></em></p>
<p><strong>This will allow me to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Arrange and rehearse material to move from feature length comedian (20-30 min) to Headline Comedian (40 min -1.5 hours), which means more pay when performing</li>
<li>Record CD to sell at shows/online for download</li>
<li>Tour Midwest and East Coast - I've already started traveling and am trying to keep up with the invitations to perform best I can.</li>
<li>Pull writings together into book.</li>
</ul><p>Completing this phase of fundraising will allow me to  move on to the next steps of acquiring legal representation and PR for the writings/performance. If it looks like we'll exceed the 11g, I'll list the next steps and what they will cost as well!</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://doggeddreamcreations.com/orlando.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
<p><strong style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">JUST FOR YOU:</strong></p>
<p>I want to create something that gives back to those who support me. Perks start at just $1 (check the right of the page for list of perks), but each contributor of $25 or more (that's less than $3 a month) will be given a log-in to a secret garden community on my web site. As a member of my secret garden, you'll get:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exclusive photos, writings, character sketches</li>
<li>Invitations to private invitation-only parties, shows, and events</li>
<li>Pieces of my writing dedicated solely to you that you can display on your profile page there.</li>
<li>Notices when I need extras, help, etc with my projects</li>
<li>Updates on each project as it unfolds and tour diaries</li>
</ul><p>Contributors are invited to be an interactive part of my world and creative process as I will continue to use the garden for all future projects (novels and tv pilots). </p>
<p>I'll sweeten the deal once a week during this campaign by releasing an extra perk for the first five contributors each week of a certain amount. </p>
<p><strong>If you donate more than once, we will total your donations and give you the highest perk you are eligible for based on total amount donated.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I'll be throwing down after my fundraising drive with a very interactive and fun redheaded wild rumpus of a show for contributors only! We'll be recording the show for a CD, and you'll be the first to see my new stage show!</strong></p>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://doggeddreamcreations.com/pam.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<h2>
<strong>Spread the Love!</strong><strong style=""font-size: 10px;""> </strong>
</h2>
<p><strong style=""font-size: 1.5em;""> </strong><span>Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help: If you can't contribute, you can help spread the word! We can also let businesses know what kind of ""in kind"" contributions or sponsorships would help us and also garner them some promotion.</span></p>
<p>With that in mind, don't forget perks start at just $1, so don't be chicken! Scrounge some change up and then pass the word and ask your friends/families to """"give  a buck if they give a Cluck"" (and even if they don't).</p>
<p> To reach the first $11,000 goal, I would need less than $4.00 from each of my FB friends! The ideal donation is at least $25 so that you can continue to receive gifts from year round!</p>
<p><strong>Use the share tools to hit your social media pages!  Come on! Adopt a ginger! I promise to be more entertaining than a neopet, and I won’t wither away if you forget to login!!</strong></p>

Being able to record a CD, finish my book, and make the rounds to perform will allow me to have more income to support my son and myself. The complete amount of funds needed to knock out all of my plans is hefty, so I'm breaking it into several cycles. Any excess during a cycle will go towards the next cycle.
Here’s the list of things to pay for/accomplish in Phase 1:
Phase 1: 11 K
This will allow me to:

Arrange and rehearse material to move from feature length comedian (20-30 min) to Headline Comedian (40 min -1.5 hours), which means more pay when performing
Record CD to sell at shows/online for download
Tour Midwest and East Coast - I've already started traveling and am trying to keep up with the invitations to perform best I can.
Pull writings together into book.
Completing this phase of fundraising will allow me to  move on to the next steps of acquiring legal representation and PR for the writings/performance. If it looks like we'll exceed the 11g, I'll list the next steps and what they will cost as well!
 
JUST FOR YOU:
I want to create something that gives back to those who support me. Perks start at just $1 (check the right of the page for list of perks), but each contributor of $25 or more (that's less than $3 a month) will be given a log-in to a secret garden community on my web site. As a member of my secret garden, you'll get:

Exclusive photos, writings, character sketches
Invitations to private invitation-only parties, shows, and events
Pieces of my writing dedicated solely to you that you can display on your profile page there.
Notices when I need extras, help, etc with my projects
Updates on each project as it unfolds and tour diaries
Contributors are invited to be an interactive part of my world and creative process as I will continue to use the garden for all future projects (novels and tv pilots). 
I'll sweeten the deal once a week during this campaign by releasing an extra perk for the first five contributors each week of a certain amount. 
If you donate more than once, we will total your donations and give you the highest perk you are eligible for based on total amount donated.
I'll be throwing down after my fundraising drive with a very interactive and fun redheaded wild rumpus of a show for contributors only! We'll be recording the show for a CD, and you'll be the first to see my new stage show!


Spread the Love! 

 Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help: If you can't contribute, you can help spread the word! We can also let businesses know what kind of ""in kind"" contributions or sponsorships would help us and also garner them some promotion.
With that in mind, don't forget perks start at just $1, so don't be chicken! Scrounge some change up and then pass the word and ask your friends/families to """"give  a buck if they give a Cluck"" (and even if they don't).
 To reach the first $11,000 goal, I would need less than $4.00 from each of my FB friends! The ideal donation is at least $25 so that you can continue to receive gifts from year round!
Use the share tools to hit your social media pages!  Come on! Adopt a ginger! I promise to be more entertaining than a neopet, and I won’t wither away if you forget to login!!

Thanks from Divinity
 
Your contribution helps a very inspirational artist take her creations to the next level. I've been producing powerful live variety shows, giving work to hundreds of musicians, comedians, artists, performers, for four years out of pocket as a single mother, often putting others first. I've also taken the time to speak to groups and schools and help non-profits raise funds with events. I've given till I had nothing to give (literally), and have made an impact everywhere I've gone. I appreciate all help in making a further impact on the world around me - Divinity",6.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p><strong>Chapter 1: Prologue</strong><br/>The book<strong> </strong>opens with an unlikely troupe of thieves, a duo called the Thunder Brothers and led by the treasure hunter Myra, as they race to escape Alexandrian Egypt with the Red Lady of Babylon - an infernal ruby coveted by both Roman and Persian Empires, containing an encrypted message from civilization's dawn.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 2: The Red Lady of Babylon</strong><br/>The robbers escape by stealing Senator Valerian's sailing ship, only to discover a prisoner aboard named Marcus, who knows how to reveal the Red Lady's message, and a scroll from Macedon which explains it. But is this mysterious prisoner more dangerous than the Roman naval authorities who are already hunting them down?<br/> </p>

</div></div>","Hi there! This campaign is a chance for readers to purchase a digital copy of Tales of Pylea: A Hunter's Patience, a fantasy adventure that consists of 150+ pages of quality art, along with other assorted goodies including an exclusive short story!



What is Tales of Pylea?


Tales of Pylea is a fantasy webcomic series that aims to combine quality art and a solid narrative.



What's it about?
In a struggle between immortal demigods, the fate of the world lies in the hands of an introverted clerk and a brutish legbreaker.



Why would anyone back you?
The two of us grew up on the wonders of independent comic books and have always dreamt of producing our very own comic series.
Up until now, our project has been funded from our own pockets; we're doing this full-time, working every weekday to bring you quality fantasy adventure since January 2013.
In the last two years we haven't missed a single deadline, bringing our readers regular updates every Monday.
Every issue we produce is planned well in advance in a solid production pipeline with tremendous leeway for human error. 


   
What's this money supposed to fund?

We're self-employed and your contribution will allow us to cover the costs of marketing and maintaining the domain over a prolonged period.
Our goal is to raise $2000; It doesn't look like much, but your money will ease the upkeep for a project of such scope.
We won't lie to you; rather than make outrageous claims that we can't deliver on, we're keeping it simple; bringing you quality comics in a timely and reliable fashion.
Please note that due to rising shipping costs we still can't afford to sell physical books as of yet and for now our products will remain digital.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Kat Rush, and I'm a 20-year-old animation student at Sherida college. I'm also the author and illustrator of Moth, an online animated webcomic. My comic follows the story of a young telepath named Taylor Gray, who is being hunted through the southern United States by the corporation that illegally created her. But something darker is hunting Taylor as well - she is haunted by a host of mysterious demons that seem to appear only to her. Does Taylor have more powers than she knows, allowing her to see a reality that others can't percieve? Or is Taylor herself the one who is not in tune with reality? Moth is essentialy a superhero origin story with a gritty, surreal tone. As the story progresses, the book takes us on a action-packed, funny, heartfelt and beautiful adventure through the Bayou with a cast of bizzare, superpowered characters.</p>
<p>The comic is partly animated, which is a relatively new and unexplored medium that combines some looped animation with comic book format. My book is one of the very few animated webcomics available online, and the only one that uses animation in the way that I do. Because of this unusual format, Moth is very experimental in nature, and i learn new ways to apply animation in a way that serves the story all the time.

<p>Reaching my funding goal would mean that I would be able to complete the next two issues of the book, and continue to learn and create high-quality, entertaining content for free online.</p>

<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm a full-time student, which means that between my very intense program, jobs, and portfolio prep, the enormous amout of work and time that Moth requires is hard to justify doing for free, when I could be doing something with my time that would allow me to pay tuition. Without funding, there is a good chance that I will have to scrap the entire project simply because of a lack of time, which would break my heart. Even if I did decide to go ahead with the book without funding, it would take me a huge amount of time to finish the book and it would be very hard to keep momentum and get the story across.</p>
<p>The 4000$ will fund the creation of issues 2 and 3 of Moth - 2000$ an issue. That'll be almost 100 pages of full artwork and animation. Half of that money goes to me to write and draw the book, and the other half goes to a second artist ( <a href=""http://tegan-ray.deviantart.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://tegan-ray.deviantart.com/</a> ) who will colour and draw some of the layouts for the book. Quite a bit of the money will also go to fufilling perks, paying Indiegogo, and other technicalities like renewing the subcription to the comic host site.</p>
<p>With your help I'll be able not only to create the next two issues, but put so much more time and energy into finding an audience. With a bigger audience as a result of this campaign and your help, the comic might be able tos tart making money in it's own right, which would mean that I wouldn't have any trouble continuing the book until he entire volume is done.</p>
<p>When you contribute, there are a variety of really cool perks that are available. Check out the perk section - you could get a poster, t-shirt, postcards, original artwork, or even have your name or a caricature of you appear in the comic. You could recieve a poster or postcards that will have hints about the upcoming plot and Taylor's mysterious backstory.

</div></div>","Short Summary
My name is Kat Rush, and I'm a 20-year-old animation student at Sherida college. I'm also the author and illustrator of Moth, an online animated webcomic. My comic follows the story of a young telepath named Taylor Gray, who is being hunted through the southern United States by the corporation that illegally created her. But something darker is hunting Taylor as well - she is haunted by a host of mysterious demons that seem to appear only to her. Does Taylor have more powers than she knows, allowing her to see a reality that others can't percieve? Or is Taylor herself the one who is not in tune with reality? Moth is essentialy a superhero origin story with a gritty, surreal tone. As the story progresses, the book takes us on a action-packed, funny, heartfelt and beautiful adventure through the Bayou with a cast of bizzare, superpowered characters.
The comic is partly animated, which is a relatively new and unexplored medium that combines some looped animation with comic book format. My book is one of the very few animated webcomics available online, and the only one that uses animation in the way that I do. Because of this unusual format, Moth is very experimental in nature, and i learn new ways to apply animation in a way that serves the story all the time. The first 47 page issue of the comic is all online already, and you can read it here - http://mothcomic.smackjeeves.com/ . 
Reaching my funding goal would mean that I would be able to complete the next two issues of the book, and continue to learn and create high-quality, entertaining content for free online.


What I Need & What You Get
I'm a full-time student, which means that between my very intense program, jobs, and portfolio prep, the enormous amout of work and time that Moth requires is hard to justify doing for free, when I could be doing something with my time that would allow me to pay tuition. Without funding, there is a good chance that I will have to scrap the entire project simply because of a lack of time, which would break my heart. Even if I did decide to go ahead with the book without funding, it would take me a huge amount of time to finish the book and it would be very hard to keep momentum and get the story across.
The 4000$ will fund the creation of issues 2 and 3 of Moth - 2000$ an issue. That'll be almost 100 pages of full artwork and animation. Half of that money goes to me to write and draw the book, and the other half goes to a second artist ( http://tegan-ray.deviantart.com/ ) who will colour and draw some of the layouts for the book. Quite a bit of the money will also go to fufilling perks, paying Indiegogo, and other technicalities like renewing the subcription to the comic host site.
With your help I'll be able not only to create the next two issues, but put so much more time and energy into finding an audience. With a bigger audience as a result of this campaign and your help, the comic might be able tos tart making money in it's own right, which would mean that I wouldn't have any trouble continuing the book until he entire volume is done.
When you contribute, there are a variety of really cool perks that are available. Check out the perk section - you could get a poster, t-shirt, postcards, original artwork, or even have your name or a caricature of you appear in the comic. You could recieve a poster or postcards that will have hints about the upcoming plot and Taylor's mysterious backstory. Be a part of the creative process and get involved with the book by donating!


When you donate to Moth, you become a part of the project. I'm hoping to establish a direct creator-audience relationship, where you fund directly the work that you want to continue to see. And you know that I'll finish the book because the whole first issue is already up.


Other Ways You Can Help
Sharing this campaign is just as valuable to me as a donation. I want the book to be funded by people who love my work, so if that's not you - don't sweat it! But help me find people who do love it by introducing people to Moth.

<h3>Have we met yet?</h3>
<p>I’m Manek D’Silva, an illustrator and writer from India. I grew up on <i>Samurai Jack</i>, <i>One Piece</i>, and <i>Lord of the Rings</i>, and always aspired to make drawings and stories like that; they felt massive in scale, wildly fantastical in every way, but still thoroughly believable. I've learned a lot over the last decade of illustration, but <i>Bonabyl</i> is easily the most special and elaborate project I’ve ever worked on, it's full of weird creatures, wild action, hilariously cute dialogue, and a lot of heart (Go Planet!).</p>
</div><div>
<h3>So what’s the plan, fam?</h3>
<p>The goal for this campaign is set at 3000$. I plan to use it for the initial print run of the comic, marketing to new readers, as well as to fund goodies, merchandise, and the occasional chocolate cake. Mmm.</p>
<p>The reward tiers are packed with immense value: <strong>every comic is sent out as a gorgeous full-colour book, with 84 pages of story in an exclusive hard-cover just for the backers of this campaign.</strong> Since all the artwork is done, the funds will go directly into printing and delivering beautiful books to the backers of Bonabyl, so you can pledge with confidence that you’ll get your copy.</p>

</div></div>","$ MONEYMAKER Duo $
  The sketch comedy team MoneyMaker Duo was conceived in 2011 at an actor networking program in New York City. After this expensive intensive, which had promised the actors immediate success, the only connection Anni and Mia made was with one another. True to their feminine nature, they spent the majority of the program pretending to hate each other until they realized they were actually in love. If there was a word that combined goofy and sexy, it would describe their sense of humor. Any project they put their minds to is a product of equal parts hard work, passion and playfulness with a dash of sexy.

Where is your $ going?

1. A year supply of diet coke. (We may seem high maintenance, but at the end of the day all we need is a diet coke. So hydrating.)

2. A 10 day vacation for Mia and Anni to Tahiti. (Your money will cover the cost of their private villa which rests on the ocean. The Villa has a glass floor allowing Mia and Anni to look at the fish. So relaxing.)

3. Disguises for us to wear when we go out in public. (Paparazzi is so exhausting.)



BUT SERIOUSLY...
Your money will go towards helping us fund our upcoming season of digital shorts. It will help cover the cost of our directors, assistant directors, directors of photography, set designers, lighting designers, costume designers, hair and makeup artists, camera and lighting equipment, location fees and finally for all post production work. 

Our first short film ""APPETITE"" received official selection this year at the SOHO International Film Festival. We will be submitting this film to more festivals around the world. Your money will also help us pay for the applications! You can watch the trailer at http://youtu.be/8UGOioQ5w-Q.

tanke på att SS-dolken är en sådan uppenbar fetisch är det ju konstigt att det
inte är något sex i boken. Jag ska skriva en porrversion! Gör det, sa Pär.  </span>

både roligt, upphetsande och upprörande.</p>
<p><b>Äganderätten</b>, som är en resa tillbaka i tiden, börjar med
att polisarkivarien arkiverar SS-dolken, som använts vid ett självmord, och går
och tar kafferast. </p>

tar vid...   </p>

Achtung Blitzkrieg</b> kommer att tryckas i en liten och begränsad upplaga. Det är en häftad bok i kvadratiskt format  (ca 22 x 22 cm) på 32 sidor där samtliga illustrationer är tecknade som uppslag. 
<p>Målet är att få ihop 10 000 kronor. Men med 20 000 kronor utkommer boken i en betydligt finare och lyxigare version med ett högintressant nyskrivet efterord. </p>
<p><b>Achtung Blitzkrieg</b> ges ut av mig i samarbete med <a href=""http://shop.apartforlag.se/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Apart förlag</a>. </p>
<p>Den innehåller material som av vissa kan uppfattas som stötande och ingår inte i Aparts ordinarie utgivning, utan är en indie-utgåva som distribueras genom Apart. </p>
<p><b>Achtung Blitzkrieg</b> kommer att finnas i butik från och med hösten 2015.  Den kommer dock att finnas till försäljning redan på Bokmässan i Göteborg (24-27 september) i SF-bokhandelns monter (A02:42). Jag kommer även att presentera boken i Aftonbladet Kulturs monter (B07:40), samt delta i ett <a href=""http://www.bokmassan.se/sv/program/arets-program/?eventid=10646"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">samtal om erotisk litteratur</a> med <b>Carl-Michael Edenborg</b> och <b>Åsa Linderborg</b> lördagen den 26/9 kl 17-17.20.

         For english, please scroll down
Jag har skrivit en
erotisk bok som ligger mig mycket varmt om hjärtat. För att jag ska kunna ge ut den behöver jag dock er hjälp. 
Stöd projektet genom 1) en
donation 2)  att förhandsbeställa ett signerat exemplar av boken –
eller något av de olika paket du hittar till höger. Där finns bland
annat Lars Krantz fenomenala originalillustrationer. Se dem i sin helhet
samt läs mer om och ur boken på vår hemsida.                                                                           *
En SS-dolk. En SS-man. En
satanist. En bankrånare. En polisarkivarie. Och ett black
metal-band på Europaturné. 
Detta är några av huvudrollsinnehavarna i Achtung
Blitzkrieg, min debut som författare, illustrerad av Lars
Krantz.  Achtung Blitzkrieg är en fristående fortsättning på Krantz och Pär Thörns bok Äganderätten måste ständigt omförhandlas. Ett stycke sexualkarnevalisk fanfiction. Achtung Blitzkrieg är en bok som utspelar sig i fantasins allra mörkaste rum.
Achtung Blitzkrieg är boken där allt kan hända.
Achtung Blitzkrieg är en avancerad form av humor. Kanske allt för avancerad.(OBS! Boken innehåller illustrationer och ett språk som kan verka stötande för vissa personer.)
                                                                             *An SS-dagger. An SS-man. A satanist. A bankrobber. An archivist. And a black metal band on eurotour. These are some of the main characters of the erotic tale Achtung Blitzkrieg, my first book. Read an excerpt and see Lars Krantz's amazing illustrations here. And please support my project by making a donation, preorder a signed copy of the book or maybe one of the original drawings in black & white by Lars Krantz (see perks to the right).                                                                             * ""Den hårdaste svenska porrprosan sedan ""Jägarna på Karinhall""!""                              Jakob Abrahamsson, Non Stop Entertainment""Riktigt snuskigt och härligt samt skrattfest!""                                                      Lois Hansson, verksamhetsutvecklare""The perfect coffee table book""                                                                                 Yair Rubinstein
                                                                            *
Dethär är storyn: När jag fick Pär Thörn och Lars Krantz bok Äganderätten måste
ständigt omförhandlas i mina händer på bokmässan 2014
blev jag väldigt exalterad: en bok om en SS-dolks väg genom tid och rum via
dess olika innehavare – vilket genidrag! Och vilka illustrationer! 
Men, sa jag till Pär, med
tanke på att SS-dolken är en sådan uppenbar fetisch är det ju konstigt att det
inte är något sex i boken. Jag ska skriva en porrversion! Gör det, sa Pär.  
Resultatet är, att döma av mina vänners reaktioner,
både roligt, upphetsande och upprörande.
Äganderätten, som är en resa tillbaka i tiden, börjar med
att polisarkivarien arkiverar SS-dolken, som använts vid ett självmord, och går
och tar kafferast. 
Det är efter den kafferasten som Achtung Blitzkrieg
tar vid...   
                                                                         *


Achtung Blitzkrieg kommer att tryckas i en liten och begränsad upplaga. Det är en häftad bok i kvadratiskt format  (ca 22 x 22 cm) på 32 sidor där samtliga illustrationer är tecknade som uppslag. 
Målet är att få ihop 10 000 kronor. Men med 20 000 kronor utkommer boken i en betydligt finare och lyxigare version med ett högintressant nyskrivet efterord. 
Achtung Blitzkrieg ges ut av mig i samarbete med Apart förlag. 
Den innehåller material som av vissa kan uppfattas som stötande och ingår inte i Aparts ordinarie utgivning, utan är en indie-utgåva som distribueras genom Apart. 
Achtung Blitzkrieg kommer att finnas i butik från och med hösten 2015.  Den kommer dock att finnas till försäljning redan på Bokmässan i Göteborg (24-27 september) i SF-bokhandelns monter (A02:42). Jag kommer även att presentera boken i Aftonbladet Kulturs monter (B07:40), samt delta i ett samtal om erotisk litteratur med Carl-Michael Edenborg och Åsa Linderborg lördagen den 26/9 kl 17-17.20. Missa inte det!    
                                                                         *
Jenny Högström är kulturskribent, översättare och författare, med en särskild förkärlek för perversioner. Hon skriver bland annat för Aftonbladet Kultur & HD/Sydsvenskan. Detta är hennes första bok.  
Lars Krantz debuterade med serieboken Dödvatten och håller för tillfället på med den tredje och fjärde boken i sin Svarta Jorden-svit. Han älskar rollspel, serier och skräck. Han vill göra seriernas motsvarighet till ett The Sisters of Mercy-album. 
                                                                         *Här några detaljer ur illustrationerna (originalen finns alltså att köpa här till höger – och kan ses i sin helhet här):

Men det finns också ekonomiska skäl:  a) Till att börja med kommer en större del av köpesumman att gå direkt till förlaget – utan att tunnas ut via en massa mellanhänder som tar procent och provision. b) På så sätt kan vi snabbare nå break even – vilket innebär att fler smala och alternativa projekt av den här typen kan ges ut.c) Sist men inte minst: Bokens båda upphovspersoner, Jenny Högström och Lars Krantz, kommer få en högre royalty-ersättning i och med punkt a). (Satsar du dessutom på ett av Lars Krantz original kan hans ersättning rent av hamna i närheten av en skälig timlön.)

It's really mutated me. Having ""my school"" operating and having students come through my door and see me working on my book has changed me. What's the book I'm doing, you ask? I'm doing a comic book memoir about my parents for my French publisher. It will come out in France in a few months.</p><p>Since late last year I have been working on this memoir. Well, for years really in stops and starts. Then when the school, the residency, got going last year it really settled me down into a solid routine. My job, as I saw it, was to provide an example to the residents of how to use time and make comics over a longterm schedule. Deadlines and having a daily practice is the name of the game for me and the school. And that is precisely what I was able to communicate to my students in this first full year of the residency.</p><p>I made my soft deadline of July 4th 2017 and am now working on revisions as well as the French translation. See, it comes out in France first. In French. But I wrote it in English. So now it is translated and I am re-lettering it in French.</p><p>Meanwhile, my parents, want to read the book. They know I have been working on this book for a few years. They're ready. Did I mention that they are divorced and don't talk to each other? Yeah, so there's that. </p><p>So, I sat them down separately and read the book to them. They hated it! Well, not really, but if this is the movie of their life, both of them couldn't help talking back to the movie screen. And I had to be the annoyed usher who told them to keep it down while the movie was playing. Seriously. </p><p>OK, they didn't hate it. But how would you feel if your child drew a comic book about your life when you were 19 years old. Lots of embarassing stories get told. That's just the way it has to be.</p><p>Truth is, they loved the book. Well, they loved the unbound original art pages, which are what I carefully presented and read to them. And each asked when they could read it ""as a book"" and have a copy of the book.</p><p>I'd like them to read the book again - in private, in their own homes. I'd like them to be able to flip through the pages and reflect on the memories of our family. This is really made for them, and by presenting them with these printed versions I hope I can make that clear them.</p><p>I explained to them that it has to come out first in French and then it will be published in English ""in a couple years"".</p><p>My Dad asked, ""I have to wait two years before I can read it as a book?"" I replied yes, essentially, it will be roughly two years or so before it is published in English."" ""Bummer"", he said.</p><p>Indeed. </p><p>So, here we are. </p><p>I have a good friend is an expert bookbinder. They said they could teach me how to make a handmade book that looks and lasts better than any book currently made by a machine. ""Kettle stitch"" they call it. Apparently this was how all lenghty books were made, by hand, by stacking the signatures and sewing them in a ""kettle stitch"" fashion. Now when you get a great big book bound at the overseas printer, it often falls apart after one reading. Most book bindings are done with glue. If it is small enough you can ""saddle stitch"", which is oftena fancy expression for stapling. So, if you can staple it because it is too thick, you usually settle for a glue binding. Well, I'm only going to settle for a kettle stitch, and that is going to take time and money.</p><p>Money to hire my friend to teach me how to do it and then of course my time to do it. However, it dawned on me that this is precisely the skill I should be offering my students and residents here at the school. There are many small press printers, but only a few small press binders.

If you want to use PayPal Go to http://fundrazr.com/d1Gjk6?ref=ab_16oi89The Rowhouse Residency in Pittsburgh has been going on for a little over a year now. It's really mutated me. Having ""my school"" operating and having students come through my door and see me working on my book has changed me. What's the book I'm doing, you ask? I'm doing a comic book memoir about my parents for my French publisher. It will come out in France in a few months.Since late last year I have been working on this memoir. Well, for years really in stops and starts. Then when the school, the residency, got going last year it really settled me down into a solid routine. My job, as I saw it, was to provide an example to the residents of how to use time and make comics over a longterm schedule. Deadlines and having a daily practice is the name of the game for me and the school. And that is precisely what I was able to communicate to my students in this first full year of the residency.I made my soft deadline of July 4th 2017 and am now working on revisions as well as the French translation. See, it comes out in France first. In French. But I wrote it in English. So now it is translated and I am re-lettering it in French.Meanwhile, my parents, want to read the book. They know I have been working on this book for a few years. They're ready. Did I mention that they are divorced and don't talk to each other? Yeah, so there's that. So, I sat them down separately and read the book to them. They hated it! Well, not really, but if this is the movie of their life, both of them couldn't help talking back to the movie screen. And I had to be the annoyed usher who told them to keep it down while the movie was playing. Seriously. OK, they didn't hate it. But how would you feel if your child drew a comic book about your life when you were 19 years old. Lots of embarassing stories get told. That's just the way it has to be.Truth is, they loved the book. Well, they loved the unbound original art pages, which are what I carefully presented and read to them. And each asked when they could read it ""as a book"" and have a copy of the book.I'd like them to read the book again - in private, in their own homes. I'd like them to be able to flip through the pages and reflect on the memories of our family. This is really made for them, and by presenting them with these printed versions I hope I can make that clear them.I explained to them that it has to come out first in French and then it will be published in English ""in a couple years"".My Dad asked, ""I have to wait two years before I can read it as a book?"" I replied yes, essentially, it will be roughly two years or so before it is published in English."" ""Bummer"", he said.Indeed. So, here we are. I have a good friend is an expert bookbinder. They said they could teach me how to make a handmade book that looks and lasts better than any book currently made by a machine. ""Kettle stitch"" they call it. Apparently this was how all lenghty books were made, by hand, by stacking the signatures and sewing them in a ""kettle stitch"" fashion. Now when you get a great big book bound at the overseas printer, it often falls apart after one reading. Most book bindings are done with glue. If it is small enough you can ""saddle stitch"", which is oftena fancy expression for stapling. So, if you can staple it because it is too thick, you usually settle for a glue binding. Well, I'm only going to settle for a kettle stitch, and that is going to take time and money.Money to hire my friend to teach me how to do it and then of course my time to do it. However, it dawned on me that this is precisely the skill I should be offering my students and residents here at the school. There are many small press printers, but only a few small press binders. Maybe we could take a different approach simply in order to avoid glue bindings for larger works. It might work.So, I'm passing the hat. I don't have any money to spare for such a personal project. The crowdfund money for the house from a few years ago is still propping up the house. This money will go into making two copies of the book, one for each of my parents.

<h3>About this project.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Hello, my name is James Gilarte. I'm the writer and creator of the webcomic series Vengador, which I have been writing for the last 2 years. I have spent majority of this year working on a new book titled ""D.I.D"" which is a psychological thriller that focuses on a young girl who developes multiple peronsalities. In this book we see how someone with this condition is affected as well as how it affects their friends and family. We get to dive in and explore the human psyche in a way that has never been done before and see what happens when a person struggles with their inner demons. My artist Rowel Roquel is working hard on the art to this book - each week turning in more and more pages of awesome art.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I would like to make a nice paperback trade of this novel and have it distributed through out as many shops as possible for everyone to have the opportunity to read it. Writing is a passion of mine and I want to share my ideas and stories to as many people as possible in the world. I need $3500 to complete a small print run of this book and need your help to make this a project a reality.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I will be keeping keeping everyone who contributes up to date with the latest progress stages of the book as well as uploading images of the art at different stages, all the way from concept to final versions. Of course anyone who helps contribute to this project will recieve some awesome perks as a thank you from me. </p>

<p>My name is <strong>Beldan Sezen</strong> and I am a <strong>graphic novelist</strong>. </p>
<p>I live in Amsterdam where I freelance as a videographer, caretaker and image manipulator. Flexible jobs which allow me to <strong>draw and write my stories</strong>. </p>
<p>My first short story ""A Girl Named Halt""<span>,</span> published as a matchbox booklet in 2009, has by now become a collector's item. My first book, <em>Zakkum: A Graphic Murder Mystery</em>, was published last year by <a href=""http://treehousepress.co.uk/chapbook-contest/beldan-sezen/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Treehouse Press</span></a> in London.</p>
<p><strong>Currently I am working on</strong> my second book, <strong>""Snapshots of a Girl"" </strong>which will be published by Becco Giallo in 2013. </p>
<p><span><strong>Snapshots of a Girl</strong> is</span> a graphic novel <strong>about my coming out years</strong> in Germany, Turkey, Amsterdam and the US; about what it is to be a young woman growing up in <strong>islamic and christian societies</strong> finding her sexual identity.  </p>
<p>I was happy and proud when <span><a href=""http://blog.beccogiallo.net/category/guest-post/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Becco Giallo</a>, </span><span>a<strong> small independent publishing house</strong> based in Padova/Italy, </span>asked me to publish <strong>my graphic memoir</strong> with them. To finish this book in time I must<strong> focus fully</strong> on it for the upcoming months. <strong>And here</strong> is where <strong>you come in</strong>:</p>
<p>I am on <strong>my way to telling a wonderful and unique story</strong>. And I am telling it in a way that'll grab you right away<strong>, </strong>very<strong> intense and honest</strong>. <span>As my friend <a href=""http://bouwine.nl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bouwine</a> puts it: ""</span><em>I love your simple and very direct tone that comes straight from your heart. You make it palpable what it is to be a young woman looking for her identity in a society where you are by definition not accepted: the confusion, shame, denial and grief which arise from that. </em></p>
<p><em>What works well is that each memory-fragment stands on its own, and all together create a sense of a whole life. I love your variety of drawings, the comic style in some, and the more mood-setting ones!""</em></p>
<p><strong>Your support</strong> will allow me to accomplish my goal. To make sure that I can work <strong>intensely and without interruption</strong> for the three month so that I can met the publisher's schedule.</p>
<p>Any amount you see fit to donate <strong>will allow me to focus full-time</strong> in the month of February, March and April of 2013.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The <strong>perks</strong> I offer you together with a big fat ""Thank you!"" are<strong> handmade gifts</strong>  ""materialized"" <strong>from the Snapshots of a Girl comic world</strong>.</p>

</div></div>","Hello, 
My name is Beldan Sezen and I am a graphic novelist. 
I live in Amsterdam where I freelance as a videographer, caretaker and image manipulator. Flexible jobs which allow me to draw and write my stories. 
My first short story ""A Girl Named Halt"", published as a matchbox booklet in 2009, has by now become a collector's item. My first book, Zakkum: A Graphic Murder Mystery, was published last year by Treehouse Press in London.
Currently I am working on my second book, ""Snapshots of a Girl"" which will be published by Becco Giallo in 2013. 
Snapshots of a Girl is a graphic novel about my coming out years in Germany, Turkey, Amsterdam and the US; about what it is to be a young woman growing up in islamic and christian societies finding her sexual identity.  
I was happy and proud when Becco Giallo, a small independent publishing house based in Padova/Italy, asked me to publish my graphic memoir with them. To finish this book in time I must focus fully on it for the upcoming months. And here is where you come in:
I am on my way to telling a wonderful and unique story. And I am telling it in a way that'll grab you right away, very intense and honest. As my friend Bouwine puts it: ""I love your simple and very direct tone that comes straight from your heart. You make it palpable what it is to be a young woman looking for her identity in a society where you are by definition not accepted: the confusion, shame, denial and grief which arise from that. 
What works well is that each memory-fragment stands on its own, and all together create a sense of a whole life. I love your variety of drawings, the comic style in some, and the more mood-setting ones!""
Your support will allow me to accomplish my goal. To make sure that I can work intensely and without interruption for the three month so that I can met the publisher's schedule.
Any amount you see fit to donate will allow me to focus full-time in the month of February, March and April of 2013.
 
The perks I offer you together with a big fat ""Thank you!"" are handmade gifts  ""materialized"" from the Snapshots of a Girl comic world.
They'll give you an insider's glimpse into the Girl's world through eating, reading or through a kind greeting simply received through looking at your refrigerator each and every morning.
 

 
 Snap 1: 
As a Thank You you will recieve the Snapshot of a Girl magnet!
  
 

 
 
Snap 2:
The Girl's ABC-cookies! A box of home-made cookies specially baked for you. Read your cookies before munching...
*Caution: animal-free.
 
 
 

 Snap 3: 
You get a signed print of one of the yet unpublished Snapshots of a Girl pages!

 
 

 
 
Snap 4:
A silkscreened Snapshot on handmade paper of the Girl's artwork. Ready to be signed, rolled and posted to you! 
Limited edition only available during the campaign.
 
 
 
 


Snap 5:
You will make an appereance in Snapshots of a Girl. I will draw you into the book as a comic character!
 
 

 
 
 
plus 1 EXTRA: 
As a Thank You everyone will recieve the pocket-sized Snapshot of a Girl pamphlet!
 
 
 
 
To be perfectly clear, you're supporting me in the MAKING of the book. As such I invite you to be part of the process and share with you the world of the Girl.
In what ever way you can contribute, by donating or spreading the word, I do appreciate it!
 

Questions? Problems? Inquiries? Feel free to ask me anything.

<p>Originally our plan was to court house it up before the New Year.  It seemed drab, but doable.  As you all know, we've  been living on student loans and teensy bits of income while Tyler has been in school... so we knew any wedding would be very very minimal.  But on one of our morning walks, our dreams wandered to a sunny, kid free, paradise...

....is what we always said.  Well, guess what?  Things Change (cough taxes cough).  We DO still plan on throwing an out of control shindig in the years to come.  We want to celebrate our love with all of our loved ones, but we aren't going to ask you to foot that bill ;) 
However, we are hoping our friends and  family will come together and gift us with a little elopement.... This way our future party can be ceremony free (you're welcome).     What's the Plan? Let's Break down the deets: 
Originally our plan was to court house it up before the New Year.  It seemed drab, but doable.  As you all know, we've  been living on student loans and teensy bits of income while Tyler has been in school... so we knew any wedding would be very very minimal.  But on one of our morning walks, our dreams wandered to a sunny, kid free, paradise... And Vegas is cheap, right?  We could celebrate our love, just us, while legalizing things - and still plan to have a down right shindig for our loved ones in a few years!!

Fly in and out of Vegas  - Pick up a marriage certificate  -  See a show  -  Eat buffet food  - Drink sugary liquor  -  Rent some bikes and ride through a drive-thru window  -  Lay by a pool without ANY children (NONE!)  - Fly home.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Do you think about what Proto Indo European was like, or wonder what language they spoke in France before the Romans arrived? These are the kinds of questions that are what make language interesting. It's amazing that something as interesting as language can be made so dry by poor quality textbooks and unengaged teachers.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484231279/m7fg38qkeslwsju2m7qo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I aim to bring fun and humour to your language world. Did you know that the French word for ""avocado"" and ""advocate"" are the same? So in court, people are always talking about avocats, and you wouldn't know if they are talking about avocados or advocates, but I suppose you could make a good guess :)</p>
<p>Hi, by the way. My name is Rolf Weimar. I am a programmer by trade, but recently I have gotten into language more and more. I have always been interested in language, but never spent too much time in it. When I went freelance in 2014, I had plenty of time to spend much more time in language than I had before and I found that there is a lot of material here to make a great comic out of.</p>
<p>In 2015, I started making the Silly Linguistics comic and publishing it on Facebook. It was a good place to get my footing. Since then I have published over 50 comics and I plan to keep going. Social media is a great way to get the word out about a project, but I want to reach out even more, so I decided to come here to you guys.</p>
<p>I want to make a physical book version of my comics, but printing books is very expensive. Most of the cost comes in at the beginning where you need to get designers involved, you need to buy ISBN numbers and of course you need to pay for the printing of actual books.</p>
<p>I need your help to make this happen. With your contribution, I can get books out to people who really want them first, and then start selling them on online book stores like Amazon. While my website and my Facebook page is growing, it is simply not big enough yet to support this endeavour by itself, so I need your help in getting this book printed and into the hands of reader here on Indiegogo, but also all language fans around the world.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484231329/etlbiducjaeb4c2frphc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need at least $1000 for all the designing and printing that is needed to get this book off the ground. But it doesn't have to come all from on place. You can give a single $20 contribution and know that you will get a copy of the comic book as well as helping making this whole project a reality.</p>
<p>If you want to contribute more than $20, you will get some exclusive perks. Have you ever wanted a comic about a certain language or language topic but no one has ever done it before? Well, if you contribute $30, I will make a comic (with your name on it!) just for you and include it in the book. There are limited numbers of these of course. It would take too long to make lots and lots and lots of individualised comics. So get them while they're hot :)</p>
<p>If you want to help out even more, contribute $50 and get the book, with personalised comic and a tshirt from the Steve the vagabond tshirt store of your choice (check out our range at <a href=""http://stevethevagabond.spreadshirt.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://stevethevagabond.spreadshirt.com/</a>)</p>
<p>For the truly generous contributor of $100, I will make a 30 minute video for you about a linguistic topic of your choice.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Before crowdfunding, things like this would simply not be possible. You would either have to raise of money yourself, or you would have to find a publisher willing to publish your book. But by going directly to language fans from around the world, we can get this comic book out to everyone who wants one and avoid any potential problems with publishers and third parties getting in the way.</p>
<p>I started Silly Linguistics on Facebook with a mission to provide a fun way of looking at language and that group has since grown to over 20 000 members and my page ""Steve the vagabond and silly linguist"" has gained over 30 000 likes. It has all been possible through languages fans everywhere and now you can make this next project a reality too!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I feel in some ways I am pioneering new ground. People have made comics before, and people have made language textbooks before, but no one has tried to bring language information and comics together in this way. The challenges I see ahead are about convincing people that this is a worthwhile thing to do, and also change people's mind about how cool languages are.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484231378/neerpfvqpucu3visj5mh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>I have already been receiving great comments on my page and on messsages to my page about how my approach has changed their mind about a lot of things.

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute to the campaign, I completely understand. But this comic is really about the community of language fans that I have met from around the world.

Even that will be a great step forward in getting people to see language differently.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>WHAT WE NEED:</strong></u></h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Our campaign goal of $20,000 will put Graphic Gwendolyn on the map. </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>HERE’S WHAT WE’LL DO WITH YOUR MONEY</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Print <u><strong>more</strong> </u>copies of the<strong><i> introductory issue</i></strong> and —get them into the hands of <u><i>educators, poetry lovers, cultural and literary influencers</i></u>. </li>
<li>
<i><strong>donate</strong></i> bundles to <i><u>schools, shelters, adult literacy programs and more. </u></i> (We’ll ask for our supporters’ recommendations!)</li>
<li>Pay for the <strong><u>layout</u> &amp; <u>design people</u></strong> of the <u><i><strong>first issues</strong></i></u> of the<strong> 2019/2020 series</strong>.</li>
<li>Pay our <u><strong>artists</strong></u>!!</li>
<li>Produce <i><strong>materials for educators.</strong></i>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>AND WE <u>WON’T</u> SPEND A LOT OF YOUR MONEY ON…</strong></p>
<p><strong>SHIPPING</strong>.  We’re proud of our Perk Packages which focus on online goodies and information as well as live experiences. We’ve kept product mailings to a minimum.</p>
<p><strong>MARKETING</strong>. We’ve been carefully building a strong word-of-mouth campaign composed of <strong>Gwendolyn Brooks</strong>’s admirers, everyday poetry lovers, poets and other writers, educators, parents and comic book fans interested in <strong>GRAPHIC GWENDOLYN</strong>’s use of the form. We’re focusing on the content and future of the project so we’ll spend very little of your money on traditional marketing. (Now, if we surpass our goal…)</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong><i>Here's the good news: </i>There is no risk to this campaign!!! </strong></u></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564116205/ien0qvghehbwsjd6evfk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>That's right Wendy!</i> If we <i>don't </i>meet our goal, <strong><i>we'll still print more copies of the introductory issue and at the very least produce the first two issues of the 2019/2020 season.</i></strong> Sadly, our print runs and donations would have to be <i>smaller </i>and <i>fewer</i> but the project you supported would exist in the world. </p>
<p>And if we significantly exceed our goal <i>(by $5000 or more)</i>, donations of bundles will increase, the word can be spread to much larger audiences and we'll create a new <strong>Gwendolyn Brooks</strong> “artifact” which we'll gift to each of our backers as a sign of our deep appreciation.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong><u>WHAT YOU GET:</u></strong></h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Most importantly, you get our issues of <strong>Graphic Gwendolyn</strong>. Each issue focuses on one work with enticing color and artistry providing time-honored words in an easily accessible format.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">But That's Not All!! </h3>
<p>We appreciate everyone who takes time out of their busy lives to support this campaign. Backers at each level are crucial and that's why EVERYone who joins our campaign gets a link to <i><strong>The Gwendolyn Connection. </strong></i></p>
<p>In these private pages you'll get :</p>
<ul>
<li> insights into the world and works of <strong>Gwendolyn Brooks</strong>.  (Not just the poetry but the person, not just the words but the woman.)</li>
<li>early access to news and information on <strong>Brooks</strong>-related projects and events across the country.</li>
<li>a gallery of pictures from her past and from <strong>Brooks </strong>programming going forward.</li>
<li>special backers-only discounts on <strong>Brooks </strong>books and gear.</li>
<li>a simply inCREDible blog packed with opportunities to interact with our team and other supporters, insights from <strong>Brooks</strong> scholars and friends, quizzes and other activities, etc. </li>
<li>carefully selected quotes and excerpts suitable for sharing with people of different ages.</li>

<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong><u>WHY YOU SHOULD CARE:</u></strong></h2>
<p>Because this is IMPORTANT! In an increasingly visual world it gets easier to “lose” someone like <strong>Gwendolyn Brooks</strong>.  She <i>hated</i> pictures of herself, <i>avoided</i> videos wherever possible and <i>never</i> went on a talk show. </p>
<p><strong>BUT she was and is a critical figure in Black culture and American literature. </strong></p>
<p>She was </p>
<ul>
<li>the first Black person to ever win the Pulitzer Prize for anything. </li>
<li>the Poet Laureate of Illinois for over 30 years. </li>
<li>the Poetry Consultant to the Library of Congress (just before they changed the title to Poet Laureate of the United States!).</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Her words still speak to today’s world:</strong></h3>
<p>For a young boy shot down in the streets</p>
<p><strong>“Our flash of Influence interrupted.”</strong></p>
<ul><li>from ""Patrick Bouie of Cabrini Green""</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p>To people imprisoned by external or internal bars </p>
<p><i><strong>“I call for you cultivation of strength in the dark.</strong></i></p>
<p><i><strong> Dark gardening</strong></i></p>
<p><i><strong> in the vertigo cold.</strong></i></p>
<p><i><strong> In the hot paralysis.”</strong></i></p>
<ul><li>from ""To Prisoners""</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p>To those with a need for the New</p>
<p>   <i><strong> “I've stayed in the front yard all my life. </strong></i></p>
<p><i><strong> I want a peek at the back.”</strong></i></p>
<ul><li>from ""a song in the front yard""</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p>To the world</p>
<p><strong><i>“…we are each other's harvest: </i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>     we are each other's business: </i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>     we are each other's magnitude and bond.”</i></strong></p>
<ul><li>from ""Paul Robeson""</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Her work is studied today as an example of meticulous form and an ingenius use of language. Countless writers and other creatives continue to site her as an inspiration for their work.</p>
<p>And now, with <strong>GRAPHIC GWENDOLYN</strong> we have a new and exciting way to bring the artistry and legacy of <strong>Gwendolyn Brooks</strong> forward into this visually-addicted time.</p>

Currently, the plan is for future volumes to contain 10 issues and to be released monthly from September to June with a paperback to follow

 
WHAT WE NEED:
Our campaign goal of $20,000 will put Graphic Gwendolyn on the map. 
 
HERE’S WHAT WE’LL DO WITH YOUR MONEY

Print more copies of the introductory issue and —get them into the hands of educators, poetry lovers, cultural and literary influencers. 

donate bundles to schools, shelters, adult literacy programs and more.  (We’ll ask for our supporters’ recommendations!)
Pay for the layout & design people of the first issues of the 2019/2020 series.
Pay our artists!!
Produce materials for educators.


 
AND WE WON’T SPEND A LOT OF YOUR MONEY ON…
SHIPPING.  We’re proud of our Perk Packages which focus on online goodies and information as well as live experiences. We’ve kept product mailings to a minimum.
MARKETING. We’ve been carefully building a strong word-of-mouth campaign composed of Gwendolyn Brooks’s admirers, everyday poetry lovers, poets and other writers, educators, parents and comic book fans interested in GRAPHIC GWENDOLYN’s use of the form. We’re focusing on the content and future of the project so we’ll spend very little of your money on traditional marketing. (Now, if we surpass our goal…)
 
Here's the good news: There is no risk to this campaign!!! 

That's right Wendy! If we don't meet our goal, we'll still print more copies of the introductory issue and at the very least produce the first two issues of the 2019/2020 season. Sadly, our print runs and donations would have to be smaller and fewer but the project you supported would exist in the world. 
And if we significantly exceed our goal (by $5000 or more), donations of bundles will increase, the word can be spread to much larger audiences and we'll create a new Gwendolyn Brooks “artifact” which we'll gift to each of our backers as a sign of our deep appreciation.
 
WHAT YOU GET:
Most importantly, you get our issues of Graphic Gwendolyn. Each issue focuses on one work with enticing color and artistry providing time-honored words in an easily accessible format.  
 
But That's Not All!! 
We appreciate everyone who takes time out of their busy lives to support this campaign. Backers at each level are crucial and that's why EVERYone who joins our campaign gets a link to The Gwendolyn Connection. 
In these private pages you'll get :

 insights into the world and works of Gwendolyn Brooks.  (Not just the poetry but the person, not just the words but the woman.)
early access to news and information on Brooks-related projects and events across the country.
a gallery of pictures from her past and from Brooks programming going forward.
special backers-only discounts on Brooks books and gear.
a simply inCREDible blog packed with opportunities to interact with our team and other supporters, insights from Brooks scholars and friends, quizzes and other activities, etc. 
carefully selected quotes and excerpts suitable for sharing with people of different ages.

At different tiers you’ll find exciting perks such as words from Gwendolyn Brooks on a birthday card customized just for YOU.  Also books, webinars, live classes and so much more.  Even an opportunity to have dinner with Gwendolyn Brooks’ daughter and get answers to your questions about her life and times.
It's a 360° look at Gwendolyn Brooks 
that is simply not available anywhere else.
 

WHY YOU SHOULD CARE:
Because this is IMPORTANT! In an increasingly visual world it gets easier to “lose” someone like Gwendolyn Brooks.  She hated pictures of herself, avoided videos wherever possible and never went on a talk show. 
BUT she was and is a critical figure in Black culture and American literature. 
She was 

the first Black person to ever win the Pulitzer Prize for anything. 
the Poet Laureate of Illinois for over 30 years. 
the Poetry Consultant to the Library of Congress (just before they changed the title to Poet Laureate of the United States!).

 
Her words still speak to today’s world:
For a young boy shot down in the streets
“Our flash of Influence interrupted.”
from ""Patrick Bouie of Cabrini Green""
 
To people imprisoned by external or internal bars 
“I call for you cultivation of strength in the dark.
 Dark gardening
 in the vertigo cold.
 In the hot paralysis.”
from ""To Prisoners""
 
To those with a need for the New
    “I've stayed in the front yard all my life. 
 I want a peek at the back.”
from ""a song in the front yard""
 
To the world
“…we are each other's harvest: 
     we are each other's business: 
     we are each other's magnitude and bond.”
from ""Paul Robeson""
 
Her work is studied today as an example of meticulous form and an ingenius use of language. Countless writers and other creatives continue to site her as an inspiration for their work.
And now, with GRAPHIC GWENDOLYN we have a new and exciting way to bring the artistry and legacy of Gwendolyn Brooks forward into this visually-addicted time.
 
OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP:

 Pass the word to friends and associates with large online followings.
 Create your own marketing. Come up with your own fabulous ideas on how to spread the word. (We know they'll be GREAT!!) 
Use a timely quote from Gwendolyn Brooks on Twitter and mention the campaign. 
Post a picture on Instagram of you or someone else reading Gwendolyn Brooks.                        and mention the campaign. 
Go live on Facebook and read a poem by Gwendolyn Brooks and… (you get the idea!)
Buy bundles of individual issues of Graphic Gwendolyns and donate them to schools, shelters, hospitals and adult literacy programs. (More information on our bundles at www.gwendolynbrooks.net)

 

THE BOTTOM LINE:

Gwendolyn Brooks made donations, created scholarships and awards. She even put checks and cash in people’s mailboxes and pockets to provide a nurturing soil in which talented artists could blossom. Now it's time for all of us to give back. 
Please join our campaign and through this illustrated poetry series, Graphic Gwendolyn, bring the lessons and inspirations of Gwendolyn Brooks to current and future generations in a whole new way.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>WHY THIS STORY?</h3>
<p> ""As a writer they say ""write what you know"". Now, I love writing high concept sci-fi and fantasy stories that immerse you into a whole new world. But this is so much more than that. This is a story about being a teenager and going after your purpose in life. Sometimes to a fault. This is a story about friendship - but also about owning, caring for and loving a pet. In my mid 20's I finally got a dog of my own, a beagle named Ellie. Taking care of a dog was more work than I ever expected. One day I took her to the park, like I did many mornings, for a game of fetch. That day Ellie was struck by a car. I had to walk back home with her in my arms while I thought her life was drifting away from her little body. She was in rough shape. All I could do was hope that she'd hang in there. Once home, we rushed to the vet so they could care for her. Luckily Ellie survived and made a full recovery. She's 3 now, living her life sprinting through the Southern California beaches. She's already taught me more than I could've expected. This is a story about appreciating what you have, before it's too late. This is a story for Ellie.""</p>

WHY THIS STORY?
 ""As a writer they say ""write what you know"". Now, I love writing high concept sci-fi and fantasy stories that immerse you into a whole new world. But this is so much more than that. This is a story about being a teenager and going after your purpose in life. Sometimes to a fault. This is a story about friendship - but also about owning, caring for and loving a pet. In my mid 20's I finally got a dog of my own, a beagle named Ellie. Taking care of a dog was more work than I ever expected. One day I took her to the park, like I did many mornings, for a game of fetch. That day Ellie was struck by a car. I had to walk back home with her in my arms while I thought her life was drifting away from her little body. She was in rough shape. All I could do was hope that she'd hang in there. Once home, we rushed to the vet so they could care for her. Luckily Ellie survived and made a full recovery. She's 3 now, living her life sprinting through the Southern California beaches. She's already taught me more than I could've expected. This is a story about appreciating what you have, before it's too late. This is a story for Ellie.""

Beastlands #1 is already 100% finished and printed! Now we're using InDemand to find a wider audience!
SHIPPING
 

It's important to us that your comics arrive safe and undamaged!
All comics will be individually bagged and boarded. Then shipped into the secure Gemini Comic Supply Flash Mailers, which provides impact resistant protection.  We'll be doing all the packaging ourselves to ensure it's done right and safe.
 
WHY CROWDFUNDING?
As a group of independent creators crowdfunding is a chance for us to self publish and produce this comic.  Sure, we'd love to have a publisher with us on the series someday. But right now, this is as raw as it gets. This is a group of friends and creators making something for the love and passion of it. This is us trying to get our story out there no matter what it takes.
As a passion project we've already put hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars into this project. We're doing this for the love of comics. Crowdfunding will allow us to cover any more art costs, print the book, distribute the book, take it to conventions and hopefully continue the series of Beastlands!
Thank you so much for taking the time to check out our project. We hope you decide to join this campaign and go on an adventure with Mac, Ava and Ping!Thanks-Curtis, Jo, and Toben",30.0,0,"2 Campaigns

You give me the love and validation that we all crave. (But especially artists! We are historically a delicate people.) You are also the reason why my parents don't think I'm crazy (anymore).</p>
<p>I've been drawing ""George the Fear Monster"" comics every Friday and putting them online (fearmonster.org) for nearly a year now, and people often ask me, ""why is it a weekly comic instead of daily?"" Well, drawing a daily comic is a full-time job, and I have rent and bills to pay. </p>
<p><b>HOWEVER</b>, that is a full-time job that I would absolutely love to have! </p>
<p>The web comic is the story of me and my fear, how silly it can be, and learning how to love that part of myself.</p>
<p>A lot of conventional wisdom tells you to just ""conquer your fear."" As if it was that easy, right? But I've found that having compassion for that part of myself is far more effective than just beating myself up about it.</p>
<p>I'd like to help you learn to laugh at your fear as well, which is why I'm making George into a daily source of inspiration and laughter starting in September!</p>
<p></p>
<h3>The New Comics Industry</h3>
<p>Remember how happy you were every Sunday to sit down with the comics section of the newspaper and laugh? (Me too!) Back when people actually bought newspapers, you could make a good living as a comic strip artist. Since then, newspapers have been closing and the comics industry has changed.</p>
<p>I won't bore you with the details. . . but the short version of it is, now artists depend on the support of their fans and readers (like you!) to pay the bills.</p> </div> <div style=""""> <h3>Where the Money Goes &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>I will start drawing George comics daily in September, regardless of whether or not we reach the funding goal.<br/></p>
<p>The money raised will go toward paying for rent, food, and bills so that I can draw the comic every day! This should get me through the end of 2014 without having to worry. (I got out the spreadsheets and calculated what I need minus the costs of the merchandise, shipping, and processing fees, which is how I decided upon the weird number of $39,000.)</p>
<p>By contributing $35 or more, you get unique merchandise that won't be sold anywhere else ever again! </p>
<p>And the <b><i>first 25 people</i></b> to contribute $50 or more get their t-shirt <i><b>autographed</b></i><b><i>!</i></b></p>

</div></div>","Short Summary First of all, I just want to say thank you to all of my loyal fans and readers! You give me the love and validation that we all crave. (But especially artists! We are historically a delicate people.) You are also the reason why my parents don't think I'm crazy (anymore).
I've been drawing ""George the Fear Monster"" comics every Friday and putting them online (fearmonster.org) for nearly a year now, and people often ask me, ""why is it a weekly comic instead of daily?"" Well, drawing a daily comic is a full-time job, and I have rent and bills to pay. 
HOWEVER, that is a full-time job that I would absolutely love to have! 
The web comic is the story of me and my fear, how silly it can be, and learning how to love that part of myself.
A lot of conventional wisdom tells you to just ""conquer your fear."" As if it was that easy, right? But I've found that having compassion for that part of myself is far more effective than just beating myself up about it.
I'd like to help you learn to laugh at your fear as well, which is why I'm making George into a daily source of inspiration and laughter starting in September!

The New Comics Industry
Remember how happy you were every Sunday to sit down with the comics section of the newspaper and laugh? (Me too!) Back when people actually bought newspapers, you could make a good living as a comic strip artist. Since then, newspapers have been closing and the comics industry has changed.
I won't bore you with the details. . . but the short version of it is, now artists depend on the support of their fans and readers (like you!) to pay the bills.   Where the Money Goes & What You Get I will start drawing George comics daily in September, regardless of whether or not we reach the funding goal.
The money raised will go toward paying for rent, food, and bills so that I can draw the comic every day! This should get me through the end of 2014 without having to worry. (I got out the spreadsheets and calculated what I need minus the costs of the merchandise, shipping, and processing fees, which is how I decided upon the weird number of $39,000.)
By contributing $35 or more, you get unique merchandise that won't be sold anywhere else ever again!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Ivan Fuentes. I am a father, nerd, batman geek, and inspiring comic book writer and illustrator. I’m from a town called Hacienda Heights, CA (30 minutes away from Los Angeles). I’ve been sketching since I was 9 years old but I’ve been into comics ever since I could read. Comics became important to me because while I was growing up I didn’t have very many friends. I had a very active imagination and comics allowed me to become more artistic and creative as well as develop characters and have my own personal style when it came to super heroes. When I would read comics, it helped me develop my own style. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>With your help, I can raise funds needed to attend the next Comikaze Expo. Comikaze is presented by the legendary Stan Lee; it is one of southern california’s biggest comic book conventions. Comikaze gives comic book fans the opportunity to meet some of your favorite writers, artists, actors, and get some original pieces drawn for you by some awesome artists. It has been a dream of mine to be a part of a comic book convention. This campaign is going to help that dream come true which will in turn help another dream of mine come true: releasing my own comic book. This campaign is to help fund my booth rental as well as promotional items available during the expo. Items such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>my banner,</li>
<li>pins,</li>
<li>custom cell phone cases,</li>
<li>t-shirts, </li>
<li>stickers</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if I’m not able to reach my goal, the funds raised will still go towards all of the items listed. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Based on the success of this campaign, it will contribute towards the ultimate goal of giving something back to the community. Where I can be able to help the younger generation expand their imagination, help them get on the right track, and educate them on how being a writer and artist can be rewarding.</p>
<p>Aside from that, you’re making a huge difference in my life as well. It’s my dream to be at a comic book convention and it would mean the world to me if I were actually able to see that happen. </p>

<p>We're almost there.  Let's get it on paper &amp; make it a successful addition to the community consciousness.<br/></p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","My name's Stephen.   I've lived in SF for a while; working first at history museum, then as Information & Referral at a community center.  I've seen how many resources, fun stuff, crazy history, and unique community-experiments this city has.  I've also seen the need for better info.  Even natives seem to know a fraction of what's available.SF is a top choice for runaways, yet there is no concise central access to health info / cheap entertainment / social engagement. etc. The internet has an ocean of info but its often disperse, inaccurate hearsay, or woefully outdated.I have the info, I have the art, I know the city, I know the best local bands.  I felt it had to be done.  So I did it.Now you don't have to be ""the health nut"" to know how to get free vaccines, city insurance, or know whats in-season & local. You don't have to be ""the political one"" to know your local reps number, or what companies are still anti-gay, or what your rights at work are.Now you don't have to ""be connected"" to be informed. (paper y'all)You don't have to remember free museum days, concerts, events, or perks for locals.All that can be right there in your Daily Planner.  Framed with local art, games, local history, & a bunch more stuff.You can see what's inside farther down.  First, let's get down to business:It's IN MY COMPUTER now, and getting better, but it needs to be printed soon so it can go in zine stores & send it out.  2014 is approaching quickly.  I also want to give piles away to orgs that serve the poor youth (u can buy a copy for the 'give-away'-pile cheaper than for yourself).  This is why I need your help:Based on the cost of the first version in 2012, i need $7000.printing & binding 2,000 copies ($5000),pressing the CD ($1000)ruler ribbon & app publishing fees ($500)shipping to 500 to households ($1000 if I'm lucky)and of course indiegogo fees. ($500-$840).as you can see $7000 doesn't quite get there. I hope I will be able to make this difference up by selling in zine store. This is not my get-rich-quick scheme.   This is a thing that I feel needs to exist, and I am the person that needs to put it together,I know I can do it, cause I've done it before. i wanted it to be BEAUTIFUL... so me & my talented friends helped fill it with art on every page.
i wanted it to be EMPOWERING.... so i made 
sure it had democracy hacks: your (SF) rights at 
work, whistle-blowers resources, local politician info, voter registration, boycott lists, medicine hacks, etci wanted it to be USEFUL... so i filled it with essential info for locals: Last Bart, 24hr diners, muni-map, etc. 
I wanted it to be FUN....so it's got tons of  guides to free weekly open mics, pub quizzes, comedy nights, jam sessions, oyster happy hours, etc.
 i wanted it to be an ALMANAC... so i filled it ""today in local 
history"", celestial events, voting days, prophecies, local celeb b-days, free concerts, free events, free days at local attractions,
 etc.  There's even a menstrual tracking calendar.
 i wanted it to be MUSICAL..... so i included a CD of excellent unheard local bands,  12 
chords charts & music theory worth having on you.
 i
 wanted it to be useful to POOR FOLKS... so there's guides for peeps w/o
 smartphones, free vaccine programs, harm reduction, hotlines & 
local resources, free food, etc.  If you look at the incentives, you'll see at-cost rewards that fund the book going to org's that serve the community.

</div></div>","I'm Scott, the artist and writer of the online syndicated comic Nerf This (which you can read at nerf-this.com), AND have been doing so since March of 2009. It's been a complete blast, and I wouldn't take any of the many sleepless nights back in a second. So what this project is for is the publication if the first official Nerf This: Vomume 1 book, the printer is picked and they've gotten a quote back to me for 1000 books, which will be $7,000 with shipping included.
Since the comic is in full color, the book will also be in full color as well, toting over 140 pages of story (with commentary under most strips), and a few more pages of never seen before sketches (dinosaurs wearing monocles most likely involved). The book itself will be 8"" x 8"".  A few other things included within the book will be never before seen characters, and other variations of current characters and how they almost turned out to be.

Some Questions...
I don't have a lot of money, but I would still like to show my support!
That's more than alright, you may gladly view my work over at nerf-this.com, if you even slightly enjoy my comic, that alone means the world to me. Even the smallest steps of telling friends on Facebook, Google+, Twitter, and other social networks can be the biggest help to myself and Nerf This.When will the book/rewards be done?
If everything goes through smoothly, and I reach the pledged amount, the books will be ready and shipped out by mid-Fall (Oct or Nov).What will you do if you exceed the your goal?
If (crosses fingers) that does happen, I will simply order more books so that I'll have more to sell, and more to take with me to conventions.Why is this book so important?
Because Nerf This: Volume 1 will be first self published work, and it will provide more for me and those who frequent my store, and conventions. While I'm completely supported off of my comics, it's a very modest lifestyle, and this is one of those steps to better myself as an artist, because the better I can be, the better I can provide more content for my readersDo you have any other comics?

I will be able to bring you great content that is fresh, funny, and heartfelt. The more creative and fresh content we can get into the industry the more the industry will realize there is not only an audience for this kind of work, there is a demand. Let's get great content back in the wheel.</p>

<p>""A Bag of Squirrels"" is a view into an improv classroom where aspiring improvisors do bad improv well. The group is eager to create comedy, yet each person is challenged by his/her odd, quirky, bold personalities. It is so much fun to watch these characters' passion colliding with their natural selves, which are funnier than the actual improv. My motley crew is born from my own experiences in improv classes and richly colorful people I have met along the way.<br/></p>

<p>RED KNIGHT is an ongoing comics series featuring Todd McClain. He's 
Norfolk's one and only super hero! He's got the powers, but he has no

heroes that would stand for truth, justice, and the American way. Today,
 America has super criminals, licensed super heroes, and unlicensed 
vigilantes. Licensed heroes are mainly has-been celebrities that are
 living off their past glories. Vigilantes are out for vengeance that 
have lost touch with humanity. Super villains? Well, they're still super
 villains. The only people that can help Red Knight, are his Uncle, Nathan R. Anderson and Norfolk Police Detective, Martha Brown.<br/><br/> RED KNIGHT : A KNIGHT WITHOUT A SWORD<br/> In the
 first story arc, Todd jumps head first into the world of super powers. 
The bad guys and the cops are out to get him. Will Red Knight survive

the U.S. military. In the spring of 2013, the group traveled to Germany,
Belgium, and England to provide some much-needed comedic relief and help boost
morale at eight different military bases. It was the experience of a lifetime

<p></p></div>","What is Scrumdillyumptious?
Jill Bryan's Scrumdillyumptious is a
sketch comedy/variety show starring the very talented Jill Bryan.
Jill has teamed up with the Creator,
Producer, and Director of the show Adrian Cordero to bring viewers original
sketch performances, entertaining YouTube clips, and pretty much anything
that's going to make you laugh.  The show will also introduce very
talented local comedians and comedic actors from the Phoenix and Los Angeles
area.
 Producer/Director, Adrian Cordero
has been in the entertainment industry for the last 7 years. Starting as a
Booking Agent/ Promoter, Adrian realized that with the overwhelming talent here
in Phoenix, he could put together something special.  After producing
multiple successful standup comedy shows around town, he then decided to take
it one step further and start filming sketch comedy routines. A big fan
of Saturday Night Live, and The Chapelle show made this an easy
decision for Adrian. After shooting multiple sketches he then realized that the
next step would be to reach an audience via the Web and Television. Thus, Jill
Bryan’s Scrumdillyumptious was born. Official Pilot-  http://vimeo.com/75921199
 Jill is a very versatile
comedian/comedic actor who has worked with Jimmy Fallon, DL Hughley, Jeffrey
Ross, Norm MacDonald, and Kevin Nealon to name a few. Ms. Bryan has been in the
comedy game since 2006 and has never looked back. Jill is the only female
in The Comedy Squadron, a group of five very funny comedians who perform for
the U.S. military. In the spring of 2013, the group traveled to Germany,
Belgium, and England to provide some much-needed comedic relief and help boost
morale at eight different military bases. It was the experience of a lifetime
that Jill cherishes as her greatest comedic accomplishment to date.
On Friday's you can catch Jill on
the syndicated Lu Valentino Radio Show in over 150 cities! Ms. Bryan also
has had the opportunity to be apart of a sketch comedy routine on The Jimmy
Kimmel Live Show. Comedy is Jill's passion and this makes Adrian very excited
to embark on this creative venture with such a versatile and talented
comic. 
We appreciate all the support in getting
this project off the ground. This will not go unnoticed.  Your generosity
will be rewarded. Whether it’s a thoughtful email, a t-shirt, an autographed DVD,
or an Associate or Executive Producer credit for the whole first season.
 Take great pleasure in knowing that you have just embarked on this
creative venture along with us. 


 What You Will Be Helping With:

The goal is to produce a television show that will be televised here locally in Phoenix AZ. Not to worry if you do not live in the Phoenix area. We Plan on also putting together a website where everyone will have the ability to view every episode. There unfortunately are production costs involved. This is where I ask for your support.  Production Insurance, Camera Crew, Sound Crew, Post Edit, Advertising and Marketing, Website Builder, Equipment Rentals, TV Spot, Costume and Props, are just some of the production expenses we will endure during this venture.

Your contribution whether small or big
is greatly appreciated, and is going to help us get one step closer to

Other Ways You Can Help
 If for whatever reason you are unable to make a monetary
contribution, we just ask if you could help spread the word and take the time

<p>Elish and the Wicker Tale is a children’s book by the author, Kamran Salayev. It follows the life of Elish, a young boy who has trouble communicating and coping with the world around him. Elish would rather keep to himself, doing what he loves more than anything, crafting wicker artifacts. Once trouble stirs in his world, however, Elish is set on the path of adventure, forced to step outside his comfort zone and confront his fears in order to help those around him.</p>
<p><br/>Elish’s behavior and insecurities mirror those of children around the globe who suffer from autism. Just like Elish, children with autism find it hard to understand and relate to people, so they end up devoting their time to something they can understand, usually a hobby or craft such as wicker-making. Kamran Salayev’s goal is to promote awareness of this subject through his book, and I’ve decided to join him in that endeavor.</p>
<p><br/>As of spring 2020, I’ve been working on a comic/<a href=""https://issuu.com/hertspress/docs/elish_the_wicker_tales_preview"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">graphic novel adaptation of Elish and Wicker Tale</a>, with the first issue due to be completed this summer. With support from crowdfunding, I’ll be able to publish the graphic novel, allowing children both with and without autism to access this story in a more visual and engaging form. Sales will also contribute to the cause, with 20% of profits going directly to charities and organizations that tackle autism and make the lives of children affected by it easier and happier.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The main objectives of the project:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Draw attention to the social inequality of autistic and healthy children.</li>
<li>Show the main opportunities and values through the character of the comics based on the book “Elish”</li>
<li>To create a new tolerant look for children through the illustrations.</li>
</ul>
<p>This crowdfunding project will help to take a fresh look at the whole social problem and change the established human worldview through a comic book!</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Поддержите детей-дождя: новый комикс от Тимура Ахмеджанова</strong></h3> <p>«Илиш и плетеные истории» — детская книга авторства Камрана Салаева. Она повествуют о жизни Илиша — мальчика, которому трудно находить общий язык с миром вокруг. Поэтому Илиш предпочитает оставаться сам по себе, занимаясь тем, что любит больше всего на свете — плетением. Но когда наступают тяжелые времена, Илиш встает на путь приключений; он вынужден выйти за пределы зоны комфорта и побороть свои страхи, чтобы помочь людям вокруг него.</p>
<p>Поступки и комплексы Илиша отражают поведение детей с аутизмом по всему миру. Всем, как Илишу, детям с аутизмом сложно понимать людей, поэтому они зацикливаются на чем-то, что они понимают, чаще всего этим хобби становится плетение. <strong>Цель создателя книги</strong> — Камрана Салаева — в том, чтобы повысить внимание этой темы через книгу, поэтому я решил присоединиться к нему в его начинании. С весны 2020 года я работаю над <strong><a href=""https://issuu.com/hertspress/docs/elish_the_wicker_tales_preview"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">графической адаптацией</a> ""<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Elish-Wicker-Tales-Kamran-Salayev/dp/1910886882"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Илиша и плетеных историй</a>""</strong>, первая часть которой должна выйти в свет уже этим летом. </p>
<p>С помощью краудфандинга, я смогу опубликовать серию комиксов, дав возможность детям с и без аутизма прочитать историю в более наглядной форме — в виде красочных иллюстраций. Также 20% полученных средств будут перечислены благотворительным фондам и организациям, которые делают жизнь детей с аутизмом легче и счастливее</p>

</div></div>","Elish and the Wicker Tale is a children’s book by the author, Kamran Salayev. It follows the life of Elish, a young boy who has trouble communicating and coping with the world around him. Elish would rather keep to himself, doing what he loves more than anything, crafting wicker artifacts. Once trouble stirs in his world, however, Elish is set on the path of adventure, forced to step outside his comfort zone and confront his fears in order to help those around him.
Elish’s behavior and insecurities mirror those of children around the globe who suffer from autism. Just like Elish, children with autism find it hard to understand and relate to people, so they end up devoting their time to something they can understand, usually a hobby or craft such as wicker-making. Kamran Salayev’s goal is to promote awareness of this subject through his book, and I’ve decided to join him in that endeavor.
As of spring 2020, I’ve been working on a comic/graphic novel adaptation of Elish and Wicker Tale, with the first issue due to be completed this summer. With support from crowdfunding, I’ll be able to publish the graphic novel, allowing children both with and without autism to access this story in a more visual and engaging form. Sales will also contribute to the cause, with 20% of profits going directly to charities and organizations that tackle autism and make the lives of children affected by it easier and happier.
 
The main objectives of the project:

Draw attention to the social inequality of autistic and healthy children.
Show the main opportunities and values through the character of the comics based on the book “Elish”
To create a new tolerant look for children through the illustrations.

This crowdfunding project will help to take a fresh look at the whole social problem and change the established human worldview through a comic book!
 
All sponsors will be written on the ‘thank you page’ in the book.
 

Everyone who supports the project with 10 pounds or more will be indicated as sponsors.
All sponsors who support the project with 25 pounds or more will be mentioned as sponsors and will receive an electronic copy of the book + autograph of the comic book author 
Sponsors who support the project with 50 pounds or more will be mentioned as sponsors and will receive an electronic copy of the book + autograph of the comic book author + gift copy for any world library that will be sent from the UK (free shipping)
All sponsors who support the project with 100 pounds or more will be mentioned as sponsors and will receive an electronic copy of the book + autograph of the comic book author + gift copy for any world library or institution that will be sent from the UK + original book Elish and the Wicker Tales by Kamran Salayev.

Once the book has been published by the Hertfordshire Press, it will be available for sale on the Amazon.Thanks in advance for your support!

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Alterna Comics is a small press indie comic publisher.  We only publish graphic novels (with the exception of one children's comic called The Unlikely Trio) in paperback form.  Our books are almost always in black and white; featuring unique stories from horror, sci-fi, fantasy, and action genres.  The company was started in 2006 by one person - Peter Simeti - who owns, operates, publishes, funds, and designs everything that the company does.  Without him, there would be no Alterna, end of story.  Peter is a substitute teacher with a love for comics and if things keep going the way they are, Alterna will have to cease operations within a year or two.  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I wish I could say that we are a failing business because we don't have a good product.  But unfortunately, success is what has been killing us.  Credit companies and banks have slashed our financing to the point that we can't even afford to fund for advertising, promotional items, and BOOKS.  Credit lines that used to be $10,000 are now $2,000.  We used to put out 1 to 2 books a month, we now put out 4 or 5 a year - we don't even fund the print runs for these books anymore - the creators now fund them and in turn they get a higher profit percentage to compensate their financing.  We would much rather shoulder the print run burden but it's become impossible to do so.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Sales don't come in quick enough (book distribution takes up to 6 months to pay us) and we end up accumulating over $4,000 worth of interest ever year, even though we've maintained a small profit for the past 3 years, that profit has been quickly eaten up by the bills we have.  The most ridiculous part about all of this is our company debt is around $28,000 - which isn't even a lot for most small companies. It's practically nothing compared to a lot of the debt that most small businesses have. But due to the fact that we can't even make new books to spur new income - the debt has become stifling and will eventually take its toll on us within 1 to 2 years.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The most heartbreaking aspect about the possibility of Alterna going bankrupt is the fact that a lot of people will see their dreams die with Alterna.   Sure some creators may move on to other publishers - but even that is highly unlikely because Alterna has been publishing a lot of books that everyone else has already rejected for being too ""out of the box"", ""weird"", ""not sellable"", or any other various reason to reject quality work. All of our books are critically acclaimed and have even won awards and the hearts and minds of readers all over the world.  We're sort of the Island of Misfit Toys in the comics world.  But without us, a lot of these books, writers, and artists, will lose a home.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The goal of $1,000 is extremely small compared to what we need (which would honestly be at least in the $10,000 range) but anything helps. The $1K goal will help keep us alive for at least another year as we try to weather the storm we are currently in.  We can make the $1K go far and it might just provide the cushion we need.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>For your generous donations, we will be rewarding you with books, signed copies of books, original art, commissioned art, and even a grand prize of all our books that are currently in print as well as some original artwork from the artists and creators of these books.  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you can't afford to donate, please spread the word about our campaign.  If you can put a good word for us in your Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, - any kind of social media - then that would be terrific.  We need as many people to know about this as possible so we can hopefully try and avoid bankruptcy.  thank you!!<br/></p>

</h2>

<p>Since 2000, Griot Enterprises has existed for one reason: To tell great stories featuring heroes of color.</p>
<p>We have seen many great African American superheroes in comics, but we never saw an iconic African American superhero team. We didn’t have our Justice League, our Avengers. We, as comic book fans of color, young and old, didn’t have a universe where our heroes reside...</p>
<p>... With the release of <strong><em>The Horsemen</em></strong> in 2002, Griot Enterprises filled that void.</p>
<p>Now, we are expanding our horizons and redefining what makes a hero for future generations. From pulp fiction to science fiction, from prose to graphic novels and animation, Griot Enterprises knows no boundaries…</p>
<p>… And honestly, Black heroes are cool.</p>

 The deal about Griot…


Since 2000, Griot Enterprises has existed for one reason: To tell great stories featuring heroes of color.
We have seen many great African American superheroes in comics, but we never saw an iconic African American superhero team. We didn’t have our Justice League, our Avengers. We, as comic book fans of color, young and old, didn’t have a universe where our heroes reside...
... With the release of The Horsemen in 2002, Griot Enterprises filled that void.
Now, we are expanding our horizons and redefining what makes a hero for future generations. From pulp fiction to science fiction, from prose to graphic novels and animation, Griot Enterprises knows no boundaries…
… And honestly, Black heroes are cool.

<h3>Hey there, folks!</h3>
<p>My name is Chris Otto, and in 2010, I decided to sit down and reach for my dream of becoming a cartoonist.  Although I was not an artist, I decided to go ahead and try to write <em>and</em> draw the comic myself.  I got a few ideas for strips about my dogs, which blossomed into more ideas, and sat down and created ""A Dog's Life""!  The comic follows the shenanigans of my chocolate lab, Hunter S. Thompson, his adopted sister, Gillian, and many other dogs and other creatures.</p>
<p>One day a few months later, Ben Taylor, a friend I met at the Virigina Comicon, sent me a message; ""H<span>ave you ever considered having a guest writer for your comic? I think I might have the inkling of an idea for a story arc...""  I said, ""Sure!""  His reply; ""A<span>lright well I have 4 words for you....</span><br/><br/><span>'Bark to the Future.'""</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I was sold.</span></span></p>
<p>We started posting the story in June 2011, and the story ended in July 2012. Ben wrote the first 150 strips, and I wrote the epilogue.  This book will put the entire story into one collection for easy reading.  Follow Hunter as he and Gillian are sent back in time by ""Dog"" Brown, an old friend of Hunter's.  Trapped in 1999, they must find ""Dog"" Brown to help them figure out how they can get back to their own time and their people.  Of course, things don't go smoothly.  A gang of street dogs, Hunter's flighty mother, and many other obstacles stand in their way of getting bark....er...back to the future!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We really want to print the book in color, which drives up the printing price considerably.  I am looking to raise $700 to cover the cost of printing 50 copies of ""Bark To The Future"" in full color.  All money donated will go directly into printing the book.  If our goal is exceeded, the extra funds will go towards shipping perks and printing additional copies of the book.  If the goal is not met, all funds will go into printing the book, and I will cover the remainder.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, the cover (which you can get a print of at the $15 or higher level) has been drawn by Matt and Shawn Fillbach!  The Fillbachs are most famous for their work on ""Star Wars: Clone Wars Adventures"" for Dark Horse Comics, but have also put out many fantastic and mind bending graphic novels of their own!  Search them out on amazon.com, you won't be disappointed!  <a href=""http://fillbachbros.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://fillbachbros.com</a></p>
<p>The book itself will be at least 160 pages, collecting every strip from our ""Bark To The Future"" story line, plus some early character development sketches, fan art, ""How To Draw Dog Brown"", and a new original cover!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why is this important to us?</h3>
<p>This was a true labor of love by both Ben and myself.  He wrote a fantastic story, and since I only had to draw the strips, it gave me time to really concentrate on improving the way I draw and color the strips.  I grew tremendously as an artist over the course of the story, and really enjoyed drawing Ben's creative ideas!  We are both quite proud of our work and want to spread it to as many people as we can, in the form it is meant to be read in; one collection of a long form story.</p>
<p>This book WILL be published with your help!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Super Cat is a project that has been in the works for the last two years, although you could say that we have been working on this book since 1987...in a manner of speaking.  That was the year that artist Jason Contini first created Super Cat.  In 2008, as Contini began to work on the comic book LEGACIES END, he joked with the writer of that book, Nicholas J. Hearne, that he would find a way to work Super Cat into this very serious super hero mythology.  The jokes continued this way untill it was decided that maybe doing an actuall Super Cat book wouldn't be such a bad idea.  Justin Mitchiner came on board to take the writing reigns and we were off.  So this book means a lot to us.  We are not looking to take the world by storm here.  We simply have had an absolute blast plotting out the first two years worth of Super Cat stories and we just really want to share them with everyone and hope that they have the same fun with Super Cat that we have had.</p>

*******************************
On Becoming Butterflies...
We are all feeling into transcendence this year, as individuals, in our communities, and within the whole of humanity. The current is strong and so are are we! Kudos for coming this far!
 
I am a visual artist with a graphic novel in the works. It is called Black Dragon Year, and it is a story of the transformation that is currently unfolding as we embark on 2012. 

The story for this book, and the paintings/drawings that accompany it, have been coming through me daily and THIS IS THE YEAR to publish this work. I am so excited to share my art with the world, as I have been working on these paintings and this story for 2 years! What is special about this book is the style: I am using original paintings as the artwork and then using a mixed media approach with photographs, collage, and drawing to lay out the pages. 

The themes of this work include: Permaculture and (R)evolution of Consciousness, and the magically realistic story unfolds in real-time throughout the year.

You are INVITED!


   I am calling on YOU my glorious community to help me make this dream into reality. I need YOU to support my project so that I may create a high quality piece of work.  There are many ways* that you can be a part of this! The best way is to make a contribution to this campaign! 
  The first installment of Black Dragon Year will be 25 pages of full-color story-telling, and will be in print and available online this Summer! All funding raised will be put towards art materials, printing costs, and distribution of the book in installments. In return, all contributors of $15 or more will receive a copy of this first publication (in Ebook or in Hard Copy). You will also have the opportunity to:


         *Receive the Second Installment of Black  Dragon Year in advance!
          
* Have a character based on YOU in the full-length graphic novel!

*Receive Bodywork and Astrology Readings!
 
                                       AND! 
             
*Pick up an ORIGINAL PAINTING from the BOOK!!!

All funds raised beyond the goal will be put towards more chapters so that the book can be complete by the end of the Black Dragon Year (December 2012) !  AND if the Juju is REALLY FLOWIN, I would like to release a musical soundtrack alongside the book to create a truly multi-media experience.  It is a big year and I have BIG DREAMS. I hope that we can inspire each other towards the realizations of our most grand goals as we each step into this transformative  year.

I am so grateful to have an inspiring/supportive community as I venture into the mysteries of creation! Thanks in advance for your graciousness and your generosity.

</div><div>Winter 2014</div></div>","NAUGHTY ""NOOR"" NICE (NNN)
Naughty ""Noor"" Nice is a rebellion against the endless drone of insipid commercial Christmas music. Inspired by the likes of Weird Al Yankovic, Tom Waits, and local groups Kopi Kat Klan and Budak Pantai, NNN's music is the illegitimate lovechild between Jazz music and toilet humour.  
Who are we?
NNN comprises vocalist/actress Joanna Dong and pianist Aya Sekine (who are interchangeably ""Naughty"" or ""Nice"") and drummer/percussionist extraordinaire Mohamed Noor (who is steadfastly ""Noor""). Over the years however, our guest performer lineup have expanded to include an almost embarassingly stellar lineup of local musicians and singers (just to name drop, last year's concert alone featured Alemay Fernandez, Michaela Therese, Vanessa Fernandez and Lily Anna Nuris).


This December, NNN  celebrates five years of creating Christmas music mayhem. For three prolific performers with such diverse commitments, it is incredible even to ourselves that once a year, every year, for five years since 2010, we have put aside everything else in the precious month of December just to do this. Nevertheless, we foresee that some changes in the near future might mean this is the last time we get together, before moving on and taking some time off to allow the jokes to fallow. 

WE WANT TO SAVE THESE SONGS FOR POSTERITY. WE WANT TO RECORD THE SONGS SO THAT THEY CAN BE SHARED ON THE INTERNET, IF ONLY TO FADE INTO OBLIVION AFTER SOME TIME. 


  THE ALBUM
We've done it all. X'mas songs were never this wild, NNN took them to Japanese traditional, Surf-Rockabilly, Dangdut, French softporn sound track(ish), Gangsta-rap, Evergreen classic (twisted and twisted further), extreme mash-ups, ching-chong Chinese style, hard-rock and more... apparently our audience has ripped their rib cages laughing. 
Amongst those experimental arrangements, our album will feature the smash-hits which have been familiarised to some of you since our birth in year 2010. We are finalising the song list, but if any of you have any request, you can message us! 

THE GUEST MUSICIANS
Besides 3 of us, we have been going through miracles and now officially smeared with Singapore's both local and foreign talent :



Tama Goh (drums/percussions)

Brandon Wong (upright / electric bass)
Alemay Fernandez (diva vocal / dialogue)
Bani Rahman (electric bass / vocal)
Rizal Sanip (drums / percussions)
Shawn Letts (saxophone/backup vocals)

and we also have wonderful friends like actor Zachary Ho and vocalist Dawn Ho as part of some of the 'crowd' chorus!

1-Hour long documentary video full of our 5 years footages, behind the scene clips and exclusive interviews are also in the works. 





NNN NEEDS
Because our material is risqué, and potentially offensive (albeit we always try to do so in good taste), it is difficult applying for funding from you know, the proper channels. 
But just because we aren't PROPER, doesn't mean we can't get props. And I don't mean whips and handcuffs. We need your PROPS (read: support), in cash or kind. (Preferably cash!)
We are looking to raise $8000 SGD in cash and sponsorship for the following :



Studio Rental and setup


Recording, mixing, mastering


Video shoot and editing


Print and press of CDs


Marketing and promotional materials

Licences for non-public domain Christmas songs we mash-up/alter

and last but most importantly we want to pay the musicians and friends who would help us out!

HELP!Please take a look at the various options we are offering and see if you can contribute!  We have included a wide range of options for all budgets, failing which, it costs you nothing but a few minutes to SHARE AND REPOST THIS CAMPAIGN so we can get the word out. We really can't wait to let you hear our music today.

P Lovecraft. Drawn by award winning artist Rob Moran and written by award winning writer Jasper Bark, it's a 96 page graphic novel featuring four stand alone tales and one on going story that links them all together. This is a grim and cosmic love letter to the mythos that means so much to the creators.

THE STORY ARC


The linking story is set in the apocalyptic aftermath of the return of the great god Cthulhu. The scattered band of humans that survive this catastrophe scratch a bare living, hiding in the shadows of what’s left of their civilisation.

A tiny group of scientist from Miskatonic university find a way to access the fabled Library of the Yith. This is an alien archive that contains the entire history of the universe and was first mentioned in Lovecraft’s novella: ‘The Shadow Out of Time’. 
The scientists hope to find a way to stop humanity’s extinction and win back their planet from the Elder Gods. Instead they uncover four tales of cosmic terror, and personal loss, that will forever change the way you view the Cthulhu mythos. 


THE STORIES

OCCUPY THE MOUNTAINS OF MADNESS

In ‘Occupy the Mountains of Madness’ a band of eco warriors, protesting arctic oil drilling, uncovers an evil far greater than the 1% who own all our wealth.

THE COVER OUT OF SPACE



A Fortean journalist travels to Arkham’s blasted heath to investigate the mysterious disappearance of legendary, underground cartoonist Victor Rodriguez and the rumours of an alien visitation. He discovers the unimaginable truth lies between the covers of a living comic book, a sentient being, made of ink and paper, that gets high when you read it.

OUT IN INNSMOUTH



Growing up gay in the poverty ridden town of Innsmouth leaves 16 year old Zeke desperate to escape. When he meets Jay on-line he doesn’t realise that the older man is grooming him, but the sinister currents of Innsmouth’s murky past are about to catch them both in it’s inescapable undertow.

I’ve been making music since I was 14-15 years old, but I’ve been drawing since I can remember.</p><p>Now based in Cardiff I am a university graduate of which I studied Graphic Communication. Alongside university, I have run numerous successful club nights, while DJing at most of the top venues in South Wales. I now work as a Design Assistant at ‘Motel Nights’, a cafe / bar in Cardiff, looking after their brand and social media.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1604759647/ydtlbfei0jxdsi7esuok.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>(You can check out more about my music and my work for Motel Nights at the bottom of the page.)</p><h3><strong>The Project</strong></h3><p><i><strong>Til The Lights Go Out</strong></i>  is a project that illustrates the struggles of DJs and other performing artists during the pandemic. Back in March the UK Government announced a nationwide lockdown lasting around 3 months, which put a halt on retail, hospitality, pubs &amp; restaurants, and the nightlife industry. Although since then many restrictions have been eased there hasn’t been any plan to revive the nightlife industry, which has left many performing artists in the dark. This is why I have decided to name the project ‘Til The Lights Go Out’, which also represents the end of the night at a club, along with touching upon mental health.</p><p><i><strong>The Comic</strong></i>  focuses mostly on my experience, including the ups and downs of life during the pandemic whilst touching upon other people’s experiences, and poking fun at some situations I’ve encountered along the way.</p><p><i><strong>The EP</strong></i>  acts as almost a sound diary, consisting of 5 songs, featuring some of my favourite artists from Cardiff &amp; Bristol, touching upon similar topics as the comic.

Here’s a rough idea of costings for the project and where your money will go:</p><p><strong>£150 - Printing the Comic</strong></p><p><strong>£100 - USBs</strong></p><p><strong>£50 - Keyrings</strong></p><p><strong>£50 - Mastering Songs</strong></p><p><strong>£250 - Artist Features on Songs</strong></p><h3><strong>Specifications</strong></h3><p><i><strong>Comic Specs:</strong></i></p><p>A 40-page A5 Perfect Bound Booklet, with a 350gsm matt laminated cover and 150gsm silk paper pages, which has a slight sheen to it while being soft to touch.</p><p><i><strong>EP Specs:</strong></i></p><p>The songs will be on an 8GB USB, delivered with the comic, fully mastered in both WAV format (for the DJs out there) and MP3 with all the necessary track information (song ID, artwork, etc.) ready to be pasted into your personal music library.

Those of you who purchase 'The Comic' perk (or higher) will receive the 2nd book free of charge, once completed in the new year!</p><h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3><p>This project is the next step in my creative adventures, but it also has a deeper impact too. In the current climate where we’re constantly wondering what tomorrow will entail this piece of work offers somewhat of a reflection on what many of us have experienced in recent months. I believe it will be something that most people will be able to relate to, whether you’re an artist or just love a good rave, we have all been affected in some form or another.</p><p>By donating to the project you will not only be supporting me but also other people including the local businesses printing and cutting the physical products, and funding the music artists featuring on the EP.</p><p>Considering how underfunded the music industry already is, you will be directly contributing to artists continuing their craft and helping to spread awareness about the topics discussed in the project.</p><h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3><p>Along with every project comes potential risks &amp; challenges. Most of the timely stuff comes from me, including creating the comic and finishing off the EP. I have a strong relationship with the printers and Amy who creates the keyrings - both I have used for projects in the past with no issues whatsoever.</p><p>The main risk I see is if I don’t hit my target by the time the fundraiser is complete it could potentially delay you getting your juicy rewards.

The best way to help me out aside from donations is sharing the project and making some noise. Not only will it help me a great deal, it will exercise the topics of the project to more people.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What we use and need money for.</h3>
<p>Most of our current and planned expenses (around 40 %) are related to the production and future development – ordering and transportation of fabrics, sewing and printing as well as the building of a network. Around 30 % goes to people who are putting a lot of their time, energy, knowledge and skills into making it all happen. 15% covers VAT and other similar lovely and unavoidable expenses and at last, but very far from the least – starting with the new collection, 10 - 15% of each sale would go to the artists.<br/></p>
