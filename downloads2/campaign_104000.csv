<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Isaac Henry and I am from Champaign, Illinois. My sister and I have always dreamed of starting a YouTube PC Gaming channel where we could play the latest games for the public's entertainment. Currently, all we have is a store bought Dell laptop that isn't at all ready for recording gameplay and rendering/editing video footage. We have been trying to save money for the past few months and were thinking that we would definitely need some help from some other people...That's when we found Indiegogo. We thought we would give it a shot and see what would come out of it. A little background about us. I am a musician myself. I have been playing viola for about 5 years now and I also play horn and alto sax. I'm the principle violist of the East Central Illinois Youth Orchestra (ECIYO). I am also a composer and I need a powerful machine to run the composition software. My sister is and artist and a potter. She has done some stellar work making pottery and other crafts. We were planning to try to open a store to start selling her amazing work and we couldn't do that without a good PC to do business on.</p>

At the moment the  ""german version"" is sold for 479 Euros. But it is possible to lower the price. If we buy higher amounts of raw material at once we get better purchasing conditions. If we switch a few materials to cheaper alternatives (for example a beech frame is much cheaper than a maple frame and a 1 mm anti-slip-mat works as good as a 3 mm anti-slip mat) we can safe material and money to produce the same high quality at an lower price.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">With your contribution and you pre-order of the international version of Whacky Wit here on Indiegogo you help us to reach our goal and get all the materials needed for producing the boards at an larger amount. What you will get is a ""Indiegogo-Edition"" of the Whacky Wit board for a very special price. Check the perks at the side.</span><br/></p><h4><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;""><b>Why not producing in asia?</b></span></h4><p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">We know that we can save a lot of money if we start producing the game or parts of it in Asia, but it is really important to us, to produce the game in Germany. Whacky Wit in this quality and size is sure nothing for a mass market. Since we probably do not build very large amounts of Whacky Wit boards and pieces during the year, it does not matter whether we produce in Germany or Asia. But if we produce at our location we can 100% guarantee high quality. For such an exclusive, hand made board game a high quality is especially important and here in Germany we have the entire production in sight! </span></p><h4><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">Quality lasts long</span></h4><p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">If you want a board game, so fun and unique, so stable and robust that someday your grandchilds will be able to play with their grandchilds - you shall get your copy of Whacky Wit right now :-) And if you are also into the 80s retro gaming - go and select your perk on the right ...</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span><br/></p><p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">We need around <b>15,000 Euros to buy all needed materials in an amount that makes the single Whacky Wit board game less expensive</b> as it is at the moment and to produce all pieces cost-optimized. </span></p><p></p><ul>
<li>
<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">It will be great if we get around<b> 30,000 to 50,000 Euros</b> so we could buy some new machines and tools for an optimized in house production like a portal milling machine and maybe a CO2 laser cutter. Those machines help us to do more variations and also do prototypes of new games and ideas. </span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">If you help us to reach our goal we will produce a very <b>special and limited Indiegogo-Edition of your Whacky Wit board</b> as a big ""Thank You"".</span><br/>
</li>
<li>If we do not reach our entire goal, it doesn't mean that we can not produce you a nice Whacky Wit® board - So if you selected a Whacky Wit Board as your perk, <b>you will get it - no matter what</b>. It only means, that we can not buy as much raw material as we want to and that production costs are higher and manufacturing of the boards will take a bit longer. </li>

<li>I my eyes Whacky Wit is a nearly perfect board game. It is produced by hand on a very high level and it is a impressive game (please watch the videos above). The big items are perfect for children and disabled people and the rules are so simple, that they are explained in under two minutes (if you speak fast) :-) It is a lot of fun chasing Whacky or the Monsters over the board, to plan your next move and strategy and to get the best or worst roll of your dice ever. The gameplay is highly well balanced, so you can not tell if the monsters or whacky are ""the better choice"". </li>
<li>We have already funded the first, german version of Whacky Wit on the german crowdfunding plattform ""Startnext.de"", so we really know what we are doing and how we get things done. Now we want to get one step further and bring Whacky Wit as a more affordable version - and with multilingual rules and informations to the world.</li>
</ul><p><br/></p><p></p><h3><b>When will my perks arrive?</b></h3><p>As our indiegogo campaign is a flexible one, we send you your perks <b>right after we received your payment</b>. This happens for most of the perks like the added t-shirts, the Whacky Roll and so on. </p><p>The Whacky Wit Special Edition boards need to be produced, so as we have about 14 lovely maple frames in stock, we can send the first 14 boards within approx. 20 business days, because we need to produce the special indiegogo-boards wich takes some time. But: you receive your perks while this campaign runs and we will be very happy if you blog, post pictures and help us to reach as many people as possible.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Shipping costs and the possibility to bundle Whacky Wit board to save money</h3><p>Shipping is high from Germany to the States and Europe. But we received some hints from BGG-users, that bundling Whacky Wit boards may be a solution to save shipping costs for our supporters. </p><p>So we can bundle items up to 31 Kilograms which costs 105 Euro to ship this to the States. Whacky Wit is 9.2 Kilograms each packed. So if we bundle two or three boards shipping costs are lower for each item:</p><p><b>From Germany to the Unites States, Canada, Australia, Asia</b></p><ul>
<li>1 Whacky Wit board = 10 Kilograms = 50 Euros</li>
<li>2 Whacky Wit boards = 20 Kilograms = 75 Euros (37.50 Euros each)</li>
<li>3 Whacky Wit boards = 30 Kilograms = 105 Euros = (35 Euros each)</li>
</ul><p><b>From Germany to Europe (every location)</b></p><ul>
<li>1 Whacky Wit board = 10 Kilograms = 25 Euros</li>
<li>2 Whacky Wit boards = 20 Kilograms = 35 Euros (17.50 Euros each)</li>
<li>3 Whacky Wit boards = 30 Kilograms = 45 Euros = (14.66 Euros each)</li>
</ul><p>I hope this will help a bit to organize combined shipping. </p><br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>If you want to help us making the perfect board game, you are welcome to help in any way:</p><ul>
<li>We'd love to have more translations into different languages​​. So if you want to help us translating the rules into another language we do not have yet (we have german, english, french, spain, dutch and luxembourgia (Yiha!)) we appreciate your contribution. </li>
<li>We are searching for toy retailer and distributors all around the world - not only for our Whacky Wit board, but also for the other planned games of Spielquader.</li>
<li>Spread the word! Write on facebook, twitter, use your blog and share this Indiegogo-campaign with your friends and family. Show them a really cool game with a incredible magneto-mechanic technique. </li>
</ul><p></p><p>And that’s all there is to it.</p>

The rules of Whacky Wit are printed directly on the board, so you don't need to grab your rule book to check if a special situation is handled this or that way. But: these rules are in german. So what we want to do is: design a neutral and international version of the Whacky Wit board, optimize the production and make once more a perfect board game.What is it all about?There is a really great Video from BoardGameGeek-TV and their GameNight! show, where Whacky Wit is showed in a 45 minutes gameplay session. You will see how big it is, how the rules work and how much fun it is playing Whacky Wit. Watch this video and you know everything you need about Whacky Wit: It's a two player game but with some lightly variations on the rules you can also play with 3 or 5 persons as you split up the monsters into teams.

Whacky Wit is produced of over 450 pieces and has a total weight of 8 Kilograms (17.63 lbs). 


Whacky Wit is 570 x 495 x 5cm (22.44 x 19.48 x 1.96 inches) in size. This game is so large that it does not fit in a closet. So there are wall mounts on the back, so you can hang this game like a picture on the wall and put the figures on it. Looks perfect and makes it even more special. 

All pieces are hand made. The dots are glued on metal discs and the whole board is magnetic wich gives the munching of dots a very special sound and is also a great experience.
All boards are numbered with a nice printed aluminium plate showing your personal serial number of your Whacky Wit copy. 
It is set up within seconds. Pull the handles and all Dots are back and ready for the next play.
Gameplay and rules are as simple as possible. It only takes a few minutes to explain and a game takes about 10 to 20 minutes.
Whacky Wit is perfect for kids at an age of 7 and above and for all children of the 80s :-)

Why making an international version?I introduced Whacky Wit® at the SPIEL 2013 fair in Essen to a wider public. Scott Alden from BGG bought one at my booth and they did an unboxing video directly at the fair: The part ""It's a note from the designer ... uh ... in german...  *laugh*"" at 6:55 made me think about doing an international version of this game - so we worked hard and now the rules are available in german, english, french and spanish and also in luxembourgian and dutch (maybe you can help to translate the rules into your language?). How you can help?As Whacky Wit is completely hand made, it is not that cheap. At the moment the  ""german version"" is sold for 479 Euros. But it is possible to lower the price. If we buy higher amounts of raw material at once we get better purchasing conditions. If we switch a few materials to cheaper alternatives (for example a beech frame is much cheaper than a maple frame and a 1 mm anti-slip-mat works as good as a 3 mm anti-slip mat) we can safe material and money to produce the same high quality at an lower price.With your contribution and you pre-order of the international version of Whacky Wit here on Indiegogo you help us to reach our goal and get all the materials needed for producing the boards at an larger amount. What you will get is a ""Indiegogo-Edition"" of the Whacky Wit board for a very special price. Check the perks at the side.Why not producing in asia?We know that we can save a lot of money if we start producing the game or parts of it in Asia, but it is really important to us, to produce the game in Germany. Whacky Wit in this quality and size is sure nothing for a mass market. Since we probably do not build very large amounts of Whacky Wit boards and pieces during the year, it does not matter whether we produce in Germany or Asia. But if we produce at our location we can 100% guarantee high quality. For such an exclusive, hand made board game a high quality is especially important and here in Germany we have the entire production in sight! Quality lasts longIf you want a board game, so fun and unique, so stable and robust that someday your grandchilds will be able to play with their grandchilds - you shall get your copy of Whacky Wit right now :-) And if you are also into the 80s retro gaming - go and select your perk on the right ...What We Need & What You GetWe need around 15,000 Euros to buy all needed materials in an amount that makes the single Whacky Wit board game less expensive as it is at the moment and to produce all pieces cost-optimized. 

It will be great if we get around 30,000 to 50,000 Euros so we could buy some new machines and tools for an optimized in house production like a portal milling machine and maybe a CO2 laser cutter. Those machines help us to do more variations and also do prototypes of new games and ideas. 


If you help us to reach our goal we will produce a very special and limited Indiegogo-Edition of your Whacky Wit board as a big ""Thank You"".

If we do not reach our entire goal, it doesn't mean that we can not produce you a nice Whacky Wit® board - So if you selected a Whacky Wit Board as your perk, you will get it - no matter what. It only means, that we can not buy as much raw material as we want to and that production costs are higher and manufacturing of the boards will take a bit longer. 
This is Whacky Wit in DetailA lot of features are within this great board game. wonderful detailed and hand crafted. Stable but also very easy to repair. If but once a dot gets broken spare parts are included.With your Whacky Wit perk you'll get:
Whacky Wit board in a limited edition with no german text but with a nice Indiegogo-Logo on it  to commemorate this campaign and your support.

Four Monsters (Sassy, Classy, Massy and Jive), hand painted and glued with moving eyes


Three Whacky Wit figures (for three lives of course), hand painted and glued with eyes made of original 5.25"" floppy disc material

Three big 12-sided dice (Monster color, Monster number, Whacky number) with special stickers.
As an alternative to the dice you can also use the free Whacky Wit dice app for iOS, Android and on the web.
Yellow cotton bag, where all dice, whackys and monsters can be stored
Three spare dots (1 yellow, two white)
Registration Card for registering your board and to get a free member of the whacky club.
Printed multilingual instructions in german, english, french and spanish. More languages are available as pdf download (dutch and luxembourgian at the moment).
Three Whacky buttons (25mm diameter, different designs)
Nice Whacky Wit Postcard
Some maybe want to know how costly it is to produce such a board game - so here are a few pictures of how we build the board:Now you could get an idea why Whacky Wit is not cheap but good value.The PerksWe have a lot of lovely perks for you.Now also available - Whacky Mini:The Impact
I my eyes Whacky Wit is a nearly perfect board game. It is produced by hand on a very high level and it is a impressive game (please watch the videos above). The big items are perfect for children and disabled people and the rules are so simple, that they are explained in under two minutes (if you speak fast) :-) It is a lot of fun chasing Whacky or the Monsters over the board, to plan your next move and strategy and to get the best or worst roll of your dice ever. The gameplay is highly well balanced, so you can not tell if the monsters or whacky are ""the better choice"". 
We have already funded the first, german version of Whacky Wit on the german crowdfunding plattform ""Startnext.de"", so we really know what we are doing and how we get things done. Now we want to get one step further and bring Whacky Wit as a more affordable version - and with multilingual rules and informations to the world.
When will my perks arrive?As our indiegogo campaign is a flexible one, we send you your perks right after we received your payment. This happens for most of the perks like the added t-shirts, the Whacky Roll and so on. The Whacky Wit Special Edition boards need to be produced, so as we have about 14 lovely maple frames in stock, we can send the first 14 boards within approx. 20 business days, because we need to produce the special indiegogo-boards wich takes some time. But: you receive your perks while this campaign runs and we will be very happy if you blog, post pictures and help us to reach as many people as possible.Shipping costs and the possibility to bundle Whacky Wit board to save moneyShipping is high from Germany to the States and Europe. But we received some hints from BGG-users, that bundling Whacky Wit boards may be a solution to save shipping costs for our supporters. So we can bundle items up to 31 Kilograms which costs 105 Euro to ship this to the States. Whacky Wit is 9.2 Kilograms each packed. So if we bundle two or three boards shipping costs are lower for each item:From Germany to the Unites States, Canada, Australia, Asia
1 Whacky Wit board = 10 Kilograms = 50 Euros
2 Whacky Wit boards = 20 Kilograms = 75 Euros (37.50 Euros each)
3 Whacky Wit boards = 30 Kilograms = 105 Euros = (35 Euros each)
From Germany to Europe (every location)
1 Whacky Wit board = 10 Kilograms = 25 Euros
2 Whacky Wit boards = 20 Kilograms = 35 Euros (17.50 Euros each)
3 Whacky Wit boards = 30 Kilograms = 45 Euros = (14.66 Euros each)
I hope this will help a bit to organize combined shipping. Other Ways You Can HelpIf you want to help us making the perfect board game, you are welcome to help in any way:
We'd love to have more translations into different languages​​. So if you want to help us translating the rules into another language we do not have yet (we have german, english, french, spain, dutch and luxembourgia (Yiha!)) we appreciate your contribution. 
We are searching for toy retailer and distributors all around the world - not only for our Whacky Wit board, but also for the other planned games of Spielquader.
Spread the word! Write on facebook, twitter, use your blog and share this Indiegogo-campaign with your friends and family. Show them a really cool game with a incredible magneto-mechanic technique. 
And that’s all there is to it.",9.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p>Once my team and I finished the Sword Art Online Anime series, we almost immediately knew we wanted to create a game inspired by that. The combat, storyline, skills, and characters all were amazing. Once we got set up, we starting thinking of ways we could go about this. We started modeling, writing, and getting together almost 15 hours every night for a week. Once we got the basic ideas of what we wanted our game to be and how we could make it different and break the normal RPG genre, we went into action. We have recently merge with ShiniGamiCHOP Productions to increase our quality of the game as well as bringing the wait time down for release and new content. As of right now, we are only in the pre-pre alpha stage. Modeling the world and getting together the basic basic story lines. We have run out of a budget, and unless we get enough money to even begin to start this, our dreams will be crushed. My team and I are so emotionally and mentally set on this, that we have already shed tears on some of the things we have worked on. We aren't asking for much, just enough to get us by.</p>
<p>Sword Art Online is an anime based off a Virtual MMORPG, Sword Art Online. There is an action combat system that is simply outstanding.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why do we need only $5000?</strong></p>
<p><span>The $5,000 is for the licenses to use the dedicated hosting software and pay for permanent hardware for use to store the project files and use test fields for the MMO section. It will also be used to pay for the Development Kit version of the <strong>Oculus Rift</strong> and <strong>MindWave</strong> tool kit to try and make the game as close to the show as possible.

<p><strong>What Our game will consist of:</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Combat:</em></strong> 1LifeONLINE will have a very exciting action combat system with new skills added with every patch of our game. We took a vote from our community, and they said they wanted to stay true to the Sword Art Online series, and have no magic. Just melee. Don't worry though! The melee combat system will have so much more than just swinging a sword back and forth! You will be able to pick up a piece of bread and throw it at your opponent if you wanted to!(Not very effective though!) You will be able to use most objects in the world to attack with, not just swords!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Comabt in 1LifeONLINE will be something you have never seen before. You will have full control over what your character can do. The skills will be animated, but you can move throughout that animation, with changing looks depending on how you move. </p>
<p>Bosses will be a whole different story. Do you want to run up his leg in real time, dodging his hands trying to grab you? You can! The combat in boss rooms will be a whole new experience. Instead of having to stay in the same place, you will always need to move around. You will have to have a plan before going into the boss room. Everyone has to be in the best mindset, and hopefully you all will return!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Self Controlled Blocking to give full depth"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/wetoWV4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>NPCs</strong>: Most, if not alll, NPCs will have a backstory. How they got in the game, what their life was like before the game, and very emotional stories to tell. We want to give this game as much emotion and life as we possibly can. The stories will be voiced out, so you can hear the emotion in their voices. The NPCs will act like players will. Some will be chasing others down the street trying to kill another. If an NPC is ordered to work for a plate he broke, he will pick up a broom and start sweeping.(Most likely mumbling under his breath as well!) NPCs will be able to go anywhere (within reason), they'll be able to fight by your side(with the same playstyle as a human). </p>
<p>As we have said, we want to give as much life to this game as possible. We want to feel like players are protecting, not only the players, but also the NPCs.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Specialties:</strong> </p>
<p><strong><em>Perma-Death</em></strong></p>
<p>Unlike most MMORPGs today, 1LifeONLINE will feature a perma-death system. The first 10-15 levels you will be safe and free to die however many times you wanted, but after that you will be fighting for your life! No magic? No Problem! We will have different potions, pets, and items that will be able to heal while you are battling even the toughest opponents! As well as an automatic battle regeneration rate which you can advance, so you can focus more on killing! The towns, inns, and safe places in the game will feature automatic regeneration as well. While you are in a safe place, your HP will not be able to drop below 10, so you can make sure you won't die!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Dying in 1LifeONLINE will be a very sad thing"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/a1XQsXo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>Resurrection:</em></strong></p>
<p>I don't like the idea of losing all of my character data, just for dying. No worries! We will ensure to have resurrection items, and certain 'special skills and items' to make sure you won't have to go through that! If a problem occurs on our side(ie. lag or malfunction), we will ensure your character data will be saved and returned to you promptly. (We can't return your character information if it is a computer or internet issue on the client side.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>This is a community Project. Everything we create is accepted by the community.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Professions: </strong>1LifeONLINE will have no set professions, instead there will be 200+ skills that you can choose from to create your own class. You will be able to switch between to primary weapons (ie. Greatsword and in the middle of combat you need to block. You click a certain button and you put away the greatsword, and pull out a lance and spear.) We will also have a 'talent tree' (if you can call it that) with over 400 different talents that you can customize even further. No one will have the same character as you! That is how diverse the game will be.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Housing:</strong> Like most games, there will be a housing system. Once you clear a floor, you can purchase any house (that's not occupied), on that floor. The higher up, the neighborhood you're in, and the view will be taken into perspective to determine the cost. Later on in the game, in a later patch, we will hope to incorporate a House builder, where you can build a house exactly how you want it. Of course, you will be limited by the neighborhood and placement of the lot. You can own a maximum of two houses at any given time, and it will be like selling and buying a house in real life. Except less annoying!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Marriage:</strong> We will have a marriage system in our game as well. Marriage will be that of sacred oaths. When you get married in the game, you will have a shared storage space with about 50 slots, where you and your spouse can share items. If you two have more than 2 houses combined, you will have to decided which two houses you want to move into. (If you get divorced, you will get your house back at a discounted cost.) When you are in a party with your spouse and close enough to them, you will get special bonuses (example: HP Boosts, EXP Boosts, SP Boosts, etc.) </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Guilds/Legions:</strong> We haven't taken much thought into the guilding system, but we can assure you that it will be WAY different than anything you've ever seen before. We will have HUGE guild battles. We won't just have guilds we will have legions as well. Instead of members joining together to create a guild, a legion will be a group of guilds that come together to battle other legions! </p></div>","Our Project:
Once my team and I finished the Sword Art Online Anime series, we almost immediately knew we wanted to create a game inspired by that. The combat, storyline, skills, and characters all were amazing. Once we got set up, we starting thinking of ways we could go about this. We started modeling, writing, and getting together almost 15 hours every night for a week. Once we got the basic ideas of what we wanted our game to be and how we could make it different and break the normal RPG genre, we went into action. We have recently merge with ShiniGamiCHOP Productions to increase our quality of the game as well as bringing the wait time down for release and new content. As of right now, we are only in the pre-pre alpha stage. Modeling the world and getting together the basic basic story lines. We have run out of a budget, and unless we get enough money to even begin to start this, our dreams will be crushed. My team and I are so emotionally and mentally set on this, that we have already shed tears on some of the things we have worked on. We aren't asking for much, just enough to get us by.
Sword Art Online is an anime based off a Virtual MMORPG, Sword Art Online. There is an action combat system that is simply outstanding.
 
Why do we need only $5000?
The $5,000 is for the licenses to use the dedicated hosting software and pay for permanent hardware for use to store the project files and use test fields for the MMO section. It will also be used to pay for the Development Kit version of the Oculus Rift and MindWave tool kit to try and make the game as close to the show as possible. These are stretch goals the main amount is for hardware to run it in all. Before you ask if we need the servers now, I would like to point out that we will indeed need it at the time the funding is complete.

<p><strong>We've seen the power of the Dota 2 community and would love to do more. </strong>Already we have nothing but gratitude for everyone who has donated so far and helped us reach this goal, but because of the amazing interest in our campaign we are going to set stretch goals that if we reach, we promise we will fulfill.</p>

<p><em>With a deep bellow, </em><em>Beyond the Summit presents the G-7 League</em>. We'll invite the best teams from Asia to compete in an online invitational tournament.

<p><em>With some impressive micro skills, Beyond the Summit displays its true power. </em>We fly out 1 top team from North America, 1 from Europe, and 1 from Asia, and have a 4th team from one of the regions as well! We pay for their flights, arrange for accommodations, food, and plenty of liquor. They duke it out on LAN for a substantial prize pool and hang out with the BTS team for a full weekend of amazing Dota content. Think Homestory Cup, Dota style. The tournament would happen late 2013 (After TI-3), or more likely early 2014.</p>
<p><strong>_____________________________________________________________</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Hi guys!</strong></p>
<p><strong>We're David and David, and we want to build the Beyond the Summit ESPORTS Broadcast Studio!</strong> If you're reading this, you've probably watched your fair share of nail-biting Dota games, shared a few laughs with us on stream, and maybe even seen us at events such as <a href=""http://www.dota2.com/international/mainevent/results/champions/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The International 2</a>. All your support over the past years has helped us to get where we are and is the reason we are here talking to you today. Our dream is to create an ESPORTS broadcast studio in Los Angeles to produce all our content with a professional production level.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/374/733/e249cca58c7f157e2438b9d61c551d82_large.jpg?1360143508"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p><strong><a href=""http://twitch.tv/beyondthesummit/new"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Beyond the Summit</a> (BTS) sprung to life back in March of 2012.</strong> I (GoDz) was a fairly established Dota commentator at the time, and with Valve's Dota 2 starting to become a major E-sport, I was pushing for more global events, specifically in Asia. At the time, there was a plethora of European and American events, while Asia <a href=""http://imgur.com/Alry9XH"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">saw virtually none</a>. I pestered established community members and professional organizations such as GosuGamers to remedy this problem, but nothing changed. The top Asian teams were ready to switch to Dota 2, the viewers were ready to watch them play, and I was ready to commentate them, and so Beyond the Summit was born.</p>
<p>In April 2012, I ran our first Dota 2 tournament, the <a href=""http://www.gigabytedotamasters.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gigabyte Dota Masters</a>. After many sleepless nights, I manged to secure funding, commentators, a website, admins, and commitments to participate from the top teams. Finally, the event was <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=Oo_AbN4sYKA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ready to begin</a>. After inviting 22 of the best teams in Asia directly, we hosted 2 open qualifiers to give unknown teams a shot to compete with the best of Asia. Nine of these teams would go on to earn invitations to The International 2 in Seattle later that year. Seven would finish in the top 8, winning over $1.3 million dollars in total prize money, in no small part due to our efforts organizing this event and the subsequent <a href=""http://youtu.be/1izP-qxhJ6k"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Beyond the Summit World Tour</a>.</p>
<p>The Gigabyte Dota Masters was only the beginning for us. Since then, we've continued to broadcast and organize events within Asia, and recently we've begun to <a href=""http://www.joindota.com/en/news/6771-bts-weekend-cup-announced"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">expand our coverage into Europe and North America</a>.</p>
<p>When we started last April, Beyond the Summit was just a cool name. But what started as a catchy name has evolved into a philosophy that guides our every step. Like Matt said, Beyond the Summit means something different to each and every person, but to me and LD, it means that our work is never done. It means always striving to improve and never resting on our laurels. Beyond the Summit means constantly challenging ourselves to do more and to do it better.</p>
<p>For every success we've had, we've had a dozen failures, but we'll never stop experimenting with new ideas and working hard to give you guys, the teams, and the players the Dota 2 coverage you deserve. What lies Beyond the Summit? A new summit!</p>
<p>We've come a long way since BTS was founded. In our first month, we had ~80 thousand unique viewers, 50 thousand total hours watched, and 142 thousand video plays. Pretty good, right? That's what we thought!</p>
<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/ZOvMuGL.png"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">In last December ALONE</a>, we reached over 1 MILLION unique viewers, 1 MILLION total hours watched, and 3.7 MILLION video plays, all in only 14 days of broadcasting. <strong>You, and viewers like you, have made our incredible growth possible.</strong></p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/374/734/7cfef8adc35fa40a3abd4b73fb2eefc9_large.jpg?1360143538"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p><strong>Beyond the Summit, or BTS, has grown and evolved a lot in the past 10 months, but we would never have grown the way we have without all your support.</strong> This community gave me the confidence to organize and produce the first major Dota 2 tournament in Asia. This community supported my decision to give David (LD) a shot during The International 2 East Qualifiers last June, even though he was an unknown, inexperienced caster at the time. Thanks to you and viewers like you, that same LD would go on to become my full partner here at Beyond the Summit and cast the Grand Finals of the International 2 with Luminous later that year. And it's this community whose unquenchable thirst for more and better content drives us to improve our product every single day.</p>
<div>
<div>Last October, we were invited to provide official English coverage of a Chinese Dota tournament known as the G-1 League. It was the first ever Chinese Dota 2 tournament with English casters, and coming right on the heels of Valve's The International 2, we know we had to do something really special to achieve even a fraction of the production quality of that event. Unfortunately, we were a few million dollars in funding short...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We needed help, and we had faith that this community would deliver. That's why we started our search for graphics designers, video editors, and stream mods with a <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/11st4h/beyondthesummit_looking_to_hire_graphicsvideo/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Reddit post</a>! With the help of some talented community members like <a href=""https://twitter.com/Chester_Gee"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chester Gee</a>, <a href=""https://twitter.com/callmeqoj"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">QoJ</a>, and <a href=""https://twitter.com/ContinuousM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Joakim Tobiasson</a>, we put together some unique content to enhance the overall production quality of the event.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Examples of this additional production include <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyoNhn53Cs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">our now iconic BTS intro</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YfU8zocvDM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">a hype trailer for the event</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UImNppdMxls"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">group stage</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIBXn5To8K0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">playoff highlight reels</a>, team/player introductions (featuring <a href=""http://twitter.com/dpmlicious"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">DPM</a> voice acting!) for <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv_3wJ5LbcU"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">DK</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUpjDJr9txI"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LGD</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P72V7M-HC_4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">iG</a>, and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMBMIwnHWKc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Orange</a>, player interviews with <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFEnbMbZgpc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">1437</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFsILvygHCY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">iceiceice</a>, and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLOBp21fIwQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mushi</a>, translated Chinese content such as <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Waf3dLMaOeg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">iG's team discussions</a>, and overlays with daily schedules, group standings, brackets, and other important information. Our G-1 League production was the first time something of this magnitude had ever been done for an online production of a Dota 2 event.</div>
<p>It's always been our philosophy to put the teams, players, and viewers first. With the G-1 League, we wanted to create a compelling story, put faces to player's names, and give these top-class teams the exposure they deserved. Additionally, we wanted to give the viewers a memorable and enjoyable viewing experience.</p>
<p>We’ve always looked to you guys for support, inspiration, and feedback and you've never failed us. So we're coming at you again, with a bigger dream, a more ambitious goal. <strong>We're setting our sights even higher and we're confident you can make it happen.</strong></p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/374/540/5e876750ceac603834e9d9a9c4ffa583_large.jpg?1360130204"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>Thanks to your support over the past year, we've been able to devote ourselves more and more to producing e-sports content. What started as a part-time hobby for us, is quickly becoming a more full-time undertaking. <strong>Our ultimate goal? To be able to produce awesome ESPORTS content full-time for you guys, as a sustainable business.</strong></p>
<p>To achieve this goal, we need to build our studio! In a real studio, we'll have the equipment, infrastructure, and space we need to step up our production quality. Not to mention the human resources, with both of us in the same location and able to focus on organizing events and producing content. On that note, we've chosen to base ourselves in LA, in large part because we'll be near other great community figures, such as <a href=""http://twitter.com/purgegamers"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Purge</a>, <a href=""http://twitter.com/luminousinverse"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Luminous</a>, <a href=""http://twitter.com/blitz_dota"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blitz</a>, and <a href=""http://twitter.com/liquidfluff"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fluffnstuff</a>, amongst others. You better believe we plan on taking full advantage of them to improve our product!</p>
A real studio means more and better content for you to enjoy. But to make the best possible studio, we need your help. <strong>Building a full-fledged broadcast studio isn't cheap.</strong> Here's just a short list of some of the costs your contributions will help cover:<br/><ul>
<li>Travel / relocation expenses (we have to get to L.A. to build a studio there!)</li>
<li>Equipment purchases: Furniture, computers, monitors, cameras, microphones, mixers, lighting, audio gear, cabling, and more!</li>
<li>One-time startup costs: sound-proofing, networking, painting, electrical work, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, if you guys are really generous and we exceed our goal, the money will go directly into the prizepool for our first major event.</p>

UPDATE 2: WE ADDED STRETCH GOALS! THINK HOMESTORY CUP, DOTA STYLE.
UPDATE 1: WE REACHED OUR INITIAL GOAL OF $25,000 IN A LITTLE OVER 24 HOURS!
 

We've seen the power of the Dota 2 community and would love to do more. Already we have nothing but gratitude for everyone who has donated so far and helped us reach this goal, but because of the amazing interest in our campaign we are going to set stretch goals that if we reach, we promise we will fulfill.
 
With a deep bellow, Beyond the Summit presents the G-7 League. We'll invite the best teams from Asia to compete in an online invitational tournament. The format will be compelling and concise, and every game will be meaningful. Our mission? To give back to those who gave us our start, by bolstering the professional scene in the Asia-Pacific region where we got our start.
 
 
With some impressive micro skills, Beyond the Summit displays its true power. We fly out 1 top team from North America, 1 from Europe, and 1 from Asia, and have a 4th team from one of the regions as well! We pay for their flights, arrange for accommodations, food, and plenty of liquor. They duke it out on LAN for a substantial prize pool and hang out with the BTS team for a full weekend of amazing Dota content. Think Homestory Cup, Dota style. The tournament would happen late 2013 (After TI-3), or more likely early 2014.
_____________________________________________________________
 
Hi guys!
We're David and David, and we want to build the Beyond the Summit ESPORTS Broadcast Studio! If you're reading this, you've probably watched your fair share of nail-biting Dota games, shared a few laughs with us on stream, and maybe even seen us at events such as The International 2. All your support over the past years has helped us to get where we are and is the reason we are here talking to you today. Our dream is to create an ESPORTS broadcast studio in Los Angeles to produce all our content with a professional production level.

Beyond the Summit (BTS) sprung to life back in March of 2012. I (GoDz) was a fairly established Dota commentator at the time, and with Valve's Dota 2 starting to become a major E-sport, I was pushing for more global events, specifically in Asia. At the time, there was a plethora of European and American events, while Asia saw virtually none. I pestered established community members and professional organizations such as GosuGamers to remedy this problem, but nothing changed. The top Asian teams were ready to switch to Dota 2, the viewers were ready to watch them play, and I was ready to commentate them, and so Beyond the Summit was born.
In April 2012, I ran our first Dota 2 tournament, the Gigabyte Dota Masters. After many sleepless nights, I manged to secure funding, commentators, a website, admins, and commitments to participate from the top teams. Finally, the event was ready to begin. After inviting 22 of the best teams in Asia directly, we hosted 2 open qualifiers to give unknown teams a shot to compete with the best of Asia. Nine of these teams would go on to earn invitations to The International 2 in Seattle later that year. Seven would finish in the top 8, winning over $1.3 million dollars in total prize money, in no small part due to our efforts organizing this event and the subsequent Beyond the Summit World Tour.
The Gigabyte Dota Masters was only the beginning for us. Since then, we've continued to broadcast and organize events within Asia, and recently we've begun to expand our coverage into Europe and North America.
When we started last April, Beyond the Summit was just a cool name. But what started as a catchy name has evolved into a philosophy that guides our every step. Like Matt said, Beyond the Summit means something different to each and every person, but to me and LD, it means that our work is never done. It means always striving to improve and never resting on our laurels. Beyond the Summit means constantly challenging ourselves to do more and to do it better.
For every success we've had, we've had a dozen failures, but we'll never stop experimenting with new ideas and working hard to give you guys, the teams, and the players the Dota 2 coverage you deserve. What lies Beyond the Summit? A new summit!
We've come a long way since BTS was founded. In our first month, we had ~80 thousand unique viewers, 50 thousand total hours watched, and 142 thousand video plays. Pretty good, right? That's what we thought!
In last December ALONE, we reached over 1 MILLION unique viewers, 1 MILLION total hours watched, and 3.7 MILLION video plays, all in only 14 days of broadcasting. You, and viewers like you, have made our incredible growth possible.

Beyond the Summit, or BTS, has grown and evolved a lot in the past 10 months, but we would never have grown the way we have without all your support. This community gave me the confidence to organize and produce the first major Dota 2 tournament in Asia. This community supported my decision to give David (LD) a shot during The International 2 East Qualifiers last June, even though he was an unknown, inexperienced caster at the time. Thanks to you and viewers like you, that same LD would go on to become my full partner here at Beyond the Summit and cast the Grand Finals of the International 2 with Luminous later that year. And it's this community whose unquenchable thirst for more and better content drives us to improve our product every single day.

Last October, we were invited to provide official English coverage of a Chinese Dota tournament known as the G-1 League. It was the first ever Chinese Dota 2 tournament with English casters, and coming right on the heels of Valve's The International 2, we know we had to do something really special to achieve even a fraction of the production quality of that event. Unfortunately, we were a few million dollars in funding short...
 
We needed help, and we had faith that this community would deliver. That's why we started our search for graphics designers, video editors, and stream mods with a Reddit post! With the help of some talented community members like Chester Gee, QoJ, and Joakim Tobiasson, we put together some unique content to enhance the overall production quality of the event.
 
Examples of this additional production include our now iconic BTS intro, a hype trailer for the event, group stage and playoff highlight reels, team/player introductions (featuring DPM voice acting!) for DK, LGD, iG, and Orange, player interviews with 1437, iceiceice, and Mushi, translated Chinese content such as iG's team discussions, and overlays with daily schedules, group standings, brackets, and other important information. Our G-1 League production was the first time something of this magnitude had ever been done for an online production of a Dota 2 event.
It's always been our philosophy to put the teams, players, and viewers first. With the G-1 League, we wanted to create a compelling story, put faces to player's names, and give these top-class teams the exposure they deserved. Additionally, we wanted to give the viewers a memorable and enjoyable viewing experience.
We’ve always looked to you guys for support, inspiration, and feedback and you've never failed us. So we're coming at you again, with a bigger dream, a more ambitious goal. We're setting our sights even higher and we're confident you can make it happen.

Thanks to your support over the past year, we've been able to devote ourselves more and more to producing e-sports content. What started as a part-time hobby for us, is quickly becoming a more full-time undertaking. Our ultimate goal? To be able to produce awesome ESPORTS content full-time for you guys, as a sustainable business.
To achieve this goal, we need to build our studio! In a real studio, we'll have the equipment, infrastructure, and space we need to step up our production quality. Not to mention the human resources, with both of us in the same location and able to focus on organizing events and producing content. On that note, we've chosen to base ourselves in LA, in large part because we'll be near other great community figures, such as Purge, Luminous, Blitz, and Fluffnstuff, amongst others. You better believe we plan on taking full advantage of them to improve our product!
A real studio means more and better content for you to enjoy. But to make the best possible studio, we need your help. Building a full-fledged broadcast studio isn't cheap. Here's just a short list of some of the costs your contributions will help cover:
Travel / relocation expenses (we have to get to L.A. to build a studio there!)
Equipment purchases: Furniture, computers, monitors, cameras, microphones, mixers, lighting, audio gear, cabling, and more!
One-time startup costs: sound-proofing, networking, painting, electrical work, etc.

Finally, if you guys are really generous and we exceed our goal, the money will go directly into the prizepool for our first major event.


We chose indiegogo because it's a great way for you guys to contribute what you want, easily and safely, plus we get to give you some awesome rewards! 
We've done our best to come up with some cool and unique rewards for all our supporters, such as exclusive access to replays, 1-on-1 coaching in Dota or broadcasting, personalized narrations of anything you want (yes, yes, even you brushing your teeth!), rare BTS T-Shirts and gear, and much, much more!

<p><strong>NFCeek.com</strong> has created a real world near field communication (NFC) outdoor based adventure game. We are showcasing the cool and diverse things that can be done with NFC by creating a geocaching meets scavenger hunt game. <br/> By creating a fun game for users, that requires an NFC enabled phone, players will interact with locations like never before while having a great family oriented adventure. This is how you play a game WITH your Smartphone, not ON your Smartphone.</p>
<p>The goal of our campaign is to raise at least $ 7,500.00 USD to help us deploy a minimum of 25 games across the United States. Each Near Field Communication game set is made up of 4 individual NFC enabled stickers; we call them Gamekeys, that are encoded with the Latitude and Longitude of the next location for the game. You set them up on our game dashboard and then active the game for people to play.</p>
<p><strong>How do you Play?</strong></p>
<p>Players find the location of the first Keystage when they choose the game to play. Our game requires an NFC enabled Smartphone because once the player is at the first location they 'Tap' the NFC enabled Keytag to retrieve the next location.</p>
<p>Each completed game earns a Keypoint, These Keypoints are needed to earn Keybadges. The Keybadges are your levels from White Belt all the way up to a Black Belt. You can also earn Keymaster Points for every game that you setup and work your way up to the ultimate Keymaster position.</p>
<p><strong>What will we do with the Money?</strong></p>
<p>We expect that the cost of running this campaign, buying supplies, and giving rewards will cost us approximately 30% of the total amount raised. That leaves $5250.00 for us to purchase Taskrabbits for game placement. We expect that the Taskrabbits will cost us almost $200.00 average cost for each game that is deployed based on the cost of services that we have seen researching this.</p>
<p>We will purchase as many placements as we can with any amount raised or exceeding the campaign limit. We will use up to 10% of any amount in excess of our campaign set amount to cover weird or unexpected costs (Like if we max bandwidth out our provider because of response, or stuff like that)</p>
<p><strong> Taskrabbit? What's that?</strong></p>
<p>Taskrabbit.com is a service that allows you to hire a person to perform small tasks for you. We are based in Pittsburgh, PA area so we can place games in our area of the Country, but in order for the game to have value it needs to be available in more than just our region. Taskrabbits are available in 10 major cities around the county, including a few places where we don't know anyone.</p>
<p> <strong>Why not just wait for people to buy games?</strong></p>
<p>We are currently finishing up our alpha of the product. Launching our Indiegogo campaign is the start of our Beta. While we have some friends around the country, we still need to have games for people to play in as many places as possible. Also, this will help ensure that we will have as many games to choose from once we are Live.</p>
<p> <strong>What do I get for helping?</strong></p>
<p>We are offering a number of unique 'Thank You' perks for helping us out. Get a single special edition Keystone NFC sticker for just a $ 10.00 donation all the way to a low number special game set and a Keystone Contributor T-Shirt for $ 105.00. And, you will be listed on the Keystone 'Thank You' page on our website for your contribution level</p>
<p><strong> Can I help without donating money?</strong></p>
<p>YES! If you are willing to donate your time to setup a game for us we would grateful. This game would be classified as an in-house game. That means that you would not get the benefits of the game dashboard that Keymasters get, BUT you would be allowed to name the game and be listed as the creator. Note: You must have an NFC enabled phone, or a GPS device, and be willing to place and record the Latitude and Longitude of each game piece for that game for us!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your help with our campaign will give us a real leg up on getting the word out about Near Field Communication for Smartphones. We think this is an awesome technology! It allows you to have real world items, 'tagged' with NFC, linked to online information.

""Angels, Daemons and Beings Between"" - A patrons source book for the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG.
 
Here at Dragon's Hoard Publishing we love Goodman Games' Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG and all that it stands for. 
 
Dungeon Crawl Classics takes tabletop roleplaying back to its roots.  It focuses on (but is certainly not limited to!) traditional dungeon crawl adventures.  Its unique core system of rules allow for a breath of fresh air and flexibility in a crowded market.  We believe that what Goodman Games has achieved, in terms of presentation, writing, and art work, will take you into the worlds described by the authors listed in Appendix N, the influential writing described by Gary Gygax in the AD&D Dungeon Master's Guide.
 
Our goal with ""Angels, Daemons and Beings Between"" is to expand upon this amazing product by focusing on a unique concept from the DCC RPG - patron magic - and expanding it. 
 
""Angels, Daemons and Beings Between"" is a perfect bound softcover supplement book detailing a host of new patrons for use in the DCC RPG.  In terms of patrons, expect our work to show the influences of Gardner Fox, A. Merritt, Leigh Brackett, Michael Moorcock, Robert E. Howard, and H.P. Lovecraft to name a few.  ""Angels, Daemons and Beings Between"" will be a 32-page, high quality product featuring brand new artwork.  It will utilize the Open Game License and the Dungeon Crawl Classics compatibility license to ensure full compatibility to the Dungeon Crawl Classic rules set.
 
Because this project is still in development, and because we want to make this supplement really worth your time, Dragon's Hoard publishing is proud to announce a number of stretch goals to ""Angels, Daemons and Beings Between"".  For every additional goal we meet, after our initial goal, we will add an additional sixteen pages of patrons until the book reaches a staggering 96 pages, with the final 4 pages dedicated to our brand new magic items section!
 
If that isn't enough to pique your interest, we will also be providing free shipping anywhere in the world.
 
Everybody will receive the 96 page book if we hit our initial goal in one capacity or another.
 
Below we have outlined what we are hoping to achieve with this project at each stretch goal.
 
[ACHIEVED] Goal #1 - Our primary goal is to reach $2,000. If successful, everyone will receive the full book either as a PDF or book or both, depending at what amount you contribute.
 
Goal #2 & #3 Combined! - *UPDATE* Upon reaching $4,000 we are combining goals 2 and three this means if we reach the amount we will add a wopping 32 pages to the book AND you will receive Sean's module, “The Tomb of Curses” (so that means everyone who contributes $10 receives it andif you were already going to get it, yours will be a deluxe version with unique art and signed by Sean). You will also receive his second module ""The Snow Witch of the Melstarian Mountains""; she must be defeated and you're just the people to try again. It should be noted that to get the print version you must have contributed $20 otherwise it will be a PDF only.
 
Goal #4 and #5 Together at Last! - *UPDATE* If we reach $8,000, stretch goals 4 and 5 will be considered achieved. This means we will add yet another 32 pages of patrons and magic items to the book! Additionally you will receive a bonus 3-panel screen, as well as a unique game box with artwork from Scott Ackerman our Illustrator!  If you were already going to receive these items (by contributing $25 or $35 respectively), yours will be upgraded to a four panel screen and your game box will feature unique art signed by Scott.
 
Goal #6 The Final Countdown- *UPDATE* Our final stretch goal is $10,000 and should we reach it, will be a mystery addition to “Angels, Daemons and Beings Between”. This will be a special gift to all of those who donated to the project no matter the amount!
 
Perks
 
So what do you get? Our goal with the perks for ""Angels, Daemons and Beings Between"" is to provide a variety of great options for you the contributor. Every perk has a variety of items you will receive upon the completion of this project as well as being very affordable no matter what perk you select. Our perks range from $1 to $100 and even provide a sneak peek at some of the upcoming patrons that will be displayed in ""Angels, Daemons and Beings Between"". Let's take a closer look:

$10 - Enzazza, Queen of the Hive

$20 - Umwansh, Father of the Wave
 
The great water elemental Umwansh has servants who gird the oceans round.  He can bring storms against vessels far at sea, or see them safely ashore.  He is also the Lord of ManyTreasures, who has the pick of those things which have sunken in the sea from a thousand ships and a hundred drowned lands.
 
$20 perfect bound book + PDF + poster and PDF of  “The Revelation of Mulmo” by Daniel Bishop and bonus goal two & three if reached.

A creature of living metal from a far world, in turns intrigued and disgusted by organic life, Logos seeks to bring perfect geometrical Law wherever his influence is felt.  His Shapes may be of aid to those he favors, but few who fall within the ambit of the Perfect Form remain fully human themselves.
 
$40 perfect bound book + PDF + poster plus bonus dragons hoard t-shirt plus the module  “The Revelation of Mulmo” by Daniel Bishop plus bonus goals two, three, four and five, if reached.
 
$45 - Set-Utekh, the Destroyer
 
Although bound, the dark god Set-Utekh still seeks to free Himself and bring destruction upon the cosmos.  Should Set-Utekh ever be freed from His other-worldly prison, He will eat the life of stars and planets.  Until that time though, He offers much power to those who would do His dark bidding, and would gamble against the chance that some minor task their patron sets will release the Destroyer.
 
$45 perfect bound book + PDF + special dm's screen + poster + t-shirt and the module “The Revelation of Mulmo” by Daniel Bishop plus all stretch goals.
 
$50 - Mab, Dark Queen of Faerie
 
She brings dreams dark and delightful, which make men mad.  She rides the dark nights in the autumn of the year, the Hosts of the Slaugh her retainers. Slighted, she curses new-born children.  On a whim, she plucks babes from their cribs to devour, or lays with young men who arise withered and old.  Yet the Dark Queen of Faerie can be a friend to those who know their place, and who are willing to pay her awful price.
 
$50 perfect bound book + PDF + signed + special dm's screen + bonus magic item section, detailing 16 new items + poster + t-shirt and the module  “The Revelation of Mulmo” by Daniel Bishop plus all stretch goals.
 
$75 - Mulmo, He Who Whispers Forgotten Secrets
 
This tentacled mass of ever-shifting form dwells in shadows and dark spaces deep beneath the ground.  It is said that Mulmo knows every secret that has ever been forgotten.  It is said that Mulmo hears every word whispered on love's pillow, every curse screamed in defiance, rage, or hatred.  To see Mulmo is to be driven mad.  To hear Mulmo's rasping whispers is to know much...and, perhaps, also to be driven mad.
 
$75  everything mentioned above + game box with unique art by Scott Ackerman plus all stretch goals + magic item section.
 
$100 - Pesh Joomang, the Gate and the Keeper
 
In the Lands of the Sau, long ago, dwelt the sages Yaggyx and Sarnon, who distilled the visions of a slew of prior wizards and scribes into several great tomes of lore and magic.  But, as time passed, Tarot Wizards wrested the tomes from the great sages.  What Yaggyx andSarnon had wrought was distorted and lost.  Indeed, there were some who felt that the Old Magic had never truly existed, and that tales of a long-lost Golden Age were but illusions of memory.
 
It was Pesh Joomang who tracked back through the works of the great sages,  discovering thepandects of the scribes who came before Yaggyx and Sarnon, and so renewed the fires of the Old Magic.  Pesh Joomang is both the Keeper of, and the Gate to, the Old Magic.  Some claim that he is the greatest patron of them all.
 
$100 everything above plus all stretch goals + my own module signed and shrink wrapped ""The tomb of curses"", coming out this year published by Dragon  Hoard  publishing + bonus patron ""Pesh Joomang"" the greatest patron of them all, not included anywhere else.

<h2>TreesureGame mobile application helps, if your kid hates to exercise</h2>
<p><em>Finnish start-up-company Treesure has launched a gps-based mobile game, which attacks on child obesity and tries to help kids and families to exercise more.</em></p>
<p>If you google “Kid hates to exercise” you’ll get around 45 million results. That is very deep. Parents are asking what to do with a kid, who really hates to exercise and be outdoors.<br/> TreesureGame is a Finnish mobile application launched for iPhone/iPad and it will help families to activate kids more in an exciting way. TreesureGame is based on a stories and the idea is to plan a route from home to shop, kindergarten or nearby park. Along the route, the story that kid has chosen, continues and there are also activating tasks for kids and whole family.</p>
<h3>The money - Why we need it?</h3>

<p><br/> With TreesureGame, we hope to activate kids to be more physically active outdoors. And the results have been very positive so far. A father with 12-year old son tried the game out and whoops, they went on a 3,5 kilometres route just by playing pirates and policemen.

My name is Reto, I’m
34 years old. Since my childhood I’m a big formula 1 fan and a passionate
gamer. The game genre “sports management” fascinates me since I can remember.
There are quite some popular football manager games out on the market, but if
you are looking for a good racing manager you won’t find a much convincing
choice. I would like to be the one who is finally changing this. 

This is the Game

Every new player will
start in the cart racing class as a twelve-year-old. With the right settings on
your vehicle and by applying the right strategies to the race you will earn
better rankings. The better the rankings are, the sooner new teams or higher
racing classes will make you an offer to join.

Make your career from
the Cart-class to Formula BMW up to Formula 1 and finally become a legend in
racing.



What you can do in Formula Career


























































































Watch the race live


The race will start at
20:00 every other evening. You will be able to watch it live, or if you missed
it, a recording of the race. You can also choose not to watch the race, it’s up
to you.





























































































Find
the optimal setup for your qualifying


Only with the ideal
settings will you achieve a good ranking in the qualifying. Run as many
training rounds on the track as you need to find these settings. You can modify
settings on the engine’s output, the gearbox, brakes and the amount of gas.



























































































Negotiate with sponsors


As in real life you will
need to make money in Formula Career. Based on the ranking you will get price
money and next to it every racer will have undertaken sponsors. You’ll need the
money to pay for costs of the training, repairs and to buy upgrades for your
racecar. The negotiations with sponsors will be a key part of the game play.

 


























































































Improve your racing car


The right settings on the
car will not always guarantee a top ranking. You will have to improve your car
frequently. There are several upgrades available for all the different parts of
your racing car. And they have to be paid for… 



























































































Create your own driver


The players can create their
own driver in Formula Career, from the hairstyle up to the beard.



























































































Train your driver


Your driver will need
training to make a career in a higher racing class. Strength, concentration and
endurance are just some examples.






How it works






The season consists
of 15 racing weekends and will last for 1 calendar month. This means, that
there will be a race every other evening.

Day 1



8:00 – 20:00 is the
time frame for the training. This time is as well used to optimize the settings
on your race car.
Day 1 to Day 2 


20:00 – 08:00 is the time frame for the
qualification. A good starting position will decide the race. 
Day 2



At 20:00 the race begins. You can watch it live on your screen.
There is plenty to do in Formula Career in between the races. Find new
sponsors, train your driver, repair & optimize your race car and much more.




The representation





The video demonstrates how the game approximatively will represent
itself. This is not the final version yet, we will work on a highly improved
graphic in the final version. The operation has been kept simple and provides
great overview. The graphical interface will run on smartphones, tablets and PC
to ensure you can play Formula Career from everywhere you are. 


Innovation requires funds

To bring this unique game to live I will work with a German software
developer that will build this highly complex game for me. To finance this
undertaking I will need CHF 40000.-, this includes the development of the app
& graphics, renting the servers to host it and future game updates.

That you get for your funding

Perks are special as they provide you the ability to immortalize
yourself in the game. Be it as a sponsor or with your own racing team. Find
more details in the two videos.

Become a part of Formula
CareerYou can create your own
sponsor in Formula Career, give it a name and a logo to make it unique.
It’s your choice to either
give it a real name or to make up a name.
Formula Career will have a
total of 100 sponsors, that will be categorised into 5 classes:
very small    $ 50 USD
small            $ 100 USD
medium     $ 200 USD
big               $ 400 USD 
very big      $ 800 USD
Whilst the size of the logo
remains the same for all classes, a really big sponsor will be contracted more
often as the driver will be interested in the money and faster cars. This means,
that the logo of the really big sponsors will be shown in the game more often than
the really small sponsors.
Depending on the sponsors
category the price for the perks will be different. I will reserve myself the right to decide what
sponsor names I will allow in the game.

Create your own racing team
for Formula Career, give it a name and two different colors to make it unique.
It’s your choice if you use
your own name, i.e. smith racing or if you create a fantasy name. Formula
Career will have a total of 50 teams, in 5 racing classes, which each are then
divided into 3 categories:
Beginners-Team         $ 100 UDS per Team
Advanced Team         $ 500 USD per Team
Professional-Team  $
1000 USD per Team
A good team will not only earn
better reputation but as well a faster racing car, which will position you more
likely for winning the race. The different teams will have different perk
prices. I will reserve myself the right to decide what racing team names I will
allow in the game.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is David and this is my last year in university. My passion for games started very early and now I'm about to step in the world professional game development. But development tools and resources are expensive and as a student I can't afford it. I need Your help! </p>

</div><div>
<h3>Their Story</h3>
<p>In Star Frontier you'll control a spaceship with a very small crew: the Captain and the First Officer. Their mission is to visit boring worlds. Boring worlds are those which suspended communication years ago. These planets are mostly destroyed or depopulated. But on their last mission the situation gets hot. The solar system's sun is in it's final stage and about to explode in a supernova. Our heroes need to jump into light speed before the explosion reaches them. But their ship is really old and gains speed slowly. </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">A sketch that illustrates the main concept of the game.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><br/></p>
<p>Your task is to evade space refuses  so the ship can gain speed continuously. Over time the spaceships's shield will charge up and protects it, but because the shield generator is old too, it won't last long. During the great escape the Captain and the First Officer will give you some good ... and some really bad advice, and from their conversations you will learn more about them, and their early life.</p>

<p>The game's visual style will be pixel art. The player will control the ship with ""left"" and ""right"" buttons. At the top section of the screen the Captain and the First Officer append funny comments to the events below.</p>

<p>Digital Bacon is a 3 man development studio from Toronto Ontario Canada. We worked together as artists in the film industry, and as huge gamers decided to make the leap into game development. However, being far more creative than we are rich, we need help to fund this project.  In addition to day to day development costs we need help paying for things like a unity3d Pro license to take advantage of many great features not available in the indie version. We also need help paying for sound fx libraries like the great products available from BoomLibrary.com. We'll also need great music for our game, and we'll need to hire a composer to make sure we can produce the best product possible.</p>
<p>Additionally we want to be able to publish on as many platforms as possible and in as many languages as possible, your support can make all of this happen!</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Suppression is a 2D side-scrolling horror game wherein you take the role of a police officer who has recently moved to a new town. Whilst checking out an apartment in which to live he stumbles into the beginnings of an epidemic, one that is turning the residents into shambling, vicious creatures.
After becoming infected himself, the officer resolves to help as many survivors who are under siege in the apartment building as possible before he succumbs completely to the disease.
 
It is here that the game really begins, as the story branches out into many different endings that you can achieve based upon your actions.




What We Need & What You Get
The funding is going to help pay for the music/sound composer, artist and the developer to complete the project. If we don't meet the goal then it will take us a lot longer to finish the game.



The Impact
You will be helping our small team make our best game yet and allow us to dedicate more time towards finishing it off.

<h3>Celestia - a fantasy dream!</h3>
<p>The world of Celestia comprised of 18 unique lands housing interesting breeds, engaging activities, and more. Players are able to navigate and explore Celestia with a goal of unlocking all 18 worlds. Unlock all worlds to utilize the whole gene-pool and participate in each world's unique activities.</p>
<h3><strong>Breeding</strong></h3>
<p>Celestial Equine offers a sophisticated genetics system, which allows members to create their own breeds. There are two ways to create a new Celestial Equine. The first option is to breed two current breeds together, and hope for at least three significant genetic differences. A significant genetic would be body type, wings, horn, or a combination of at least three minor genetic differences (mane/tail type, base color, hoof type). The second option is to use our Art Depot area and order a custom breed by a Celestial Equine approved artist. Players have the ability to keep their breed private (unable to be created by other users) or set the breed for public use!</p>

<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Horse Creation</strong></h3>
<p>Horse creation is another leading attraction on Celestial Equine! We have two methods available for creating horses on Celestial Equine; our standard creation and and the premium creation area.</p>
<p>The standard horse creation area is available for all users! Simply navigate to your desired world, select the standard horse creation area, and choose a breed to create! You may select your horse's breed, gender, starting competition discipline, and name. A set of random genetics will be generated upon creation.</p>

<h3>Why indiegogo?</h3>
<p>Celestial Equine is currently in a live development mode with an amazing, active group of players. We are entering our final phase of development, which includes perfecting our current features, resolving lingering bugs, and most importantly improving our game's load times. In order to speed up Celestial Equine, we are needing a total overhaul of our genetics system. Due to the massive amount of genetics available for players, we have ran into glitches during breeding, breed registration, and an overall lag during browsing and other activities. Here is a breakdown of where the $1,500 will be spent:</p>
<ul><li>Genetics Overhaul - $500.00</li></ul>
<p>The genetics update will not only improve load times, but also result in a more interesting breeding experience! In addition to optimizing our database, we also have a new breeding algorithm to introduce! This new genetics feature will allow for carrier genes, incorporate genetics from the parent breeds, and add a rarity factor into the breeding script.</p>
<ul><li>Server Upgrades - $500.00</li></ul>
<p>We anticipate a sizeable influx of active players once our load times are resolved, so upgrading our servers is our second most important priority. We would like to raise 3 months worth of server fees + the fee our developer will charge to assist with the move. Our upgraded server will ensure Celestial Equine stays lighting fast!</p>
<ul><li>Bug Fixes - $300.00</li></ul>
<p>We have a handful of pesky bugs (errors) remaining that need to be resolved. These fixes will help improve the game experience and allow us to introduce new features!</p>
<ul><li>Genetics Management System Upgrades - $200.00</li></ul>
<p>The last bit of our raised funds will go towards upgrading our genetics management admin panel! These upgrades will include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding a rarity aspect to each gene and integrating into the breeding script</li>
<li>Speed up gene uploading process</li>
<li>Ability to preview recently uploaded breeds to check for errors</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>All additional funds will go towards new features!</strong></p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Luckily, Celestial Equine has already overcame most of the risks of development. We are currently a live game, so the risk of not delivering a playable game is non-existent! Our major challenge is potentially encountering a more complicated genetics issue that would result in a later than expected delivery date. A more complicated genetics re-code could also result in a higher cost, which would take away funds from new features. However, we are very confident in our amazing development team to deliver an on-time, on-budget improved genetics system!</p>

passion, that’s what M400 was born from. A game of conquest, which revolves
around an important and defining historical period: <b>the 1400.</b><p></p><p>But this century is so much more than just a bunch of
years: it’s one of the most magnificent periods in the history of Italy and the
European culture. Because it’s not a coincidence if the end of this century
marks the beginning of the “<i>Modern Age</i>”.</p>
<p><b>M400</b> comes from the idea to bring strategic board
games to the next level; neither the name nor the historical references to the
XV century are just a fortuity. The century that saw the fall of the last
Eastern Roman Empire, the birth of the power of Spain and England, the ascent
of the Russian Republics, and the achievements of the glorious Republic of
Venice are the ideal background for the birth of this new way to have fun with
history.</p>
<p><b>M400</b> has a high level of playability with multiple
players, and the cards allow an always different gameplay, helping the creation
of new and different matches. Every time a player finds themselves in the late
Medieval period of the game, they can rewrite important pages of history in new
ways, through trades, battles, journeys and revolutions. The challenge and the
strategy also allow to create with the opponents new dynamics of gameplay
beyond the rules: deceptions, bluffs, silent and secret alliances. The almost
total absence of chances and coincidences, linked to the dices, reduces the
possibility of a player to win just by chance.</p>
<p><b>M400</b> is a game which contains very different elements,
elements that can mix, and give the player a unique and unpredictable kind of
entertainment. This game is for everybody, and the choice of the Latin makes it
reach a new level of universality, just like the one of the world of the XV
century.</p><p><br/></p>

<p>The creation of M400 started during a winter night
in January 2009, when a group of<span>  friends,
tired of the dullness and the monotony of some board-games, started chatting
about ideas, solutions, projects and 
childhood dreams.</span></p>
<p>So, almost like by luck, <b>M400 was born</b>, and then
small ideas became a<span>  real project and
also a dream: the dream to create a board-game where players could battle with
cards, where luck was just a small part of the game, and where you would have
to think and show your skills, your strategy, your cunning and your bravery to
win.<b> A board-game suited for everyone</b>, from history lovers to fight and
conquest game lovers, from children to adults, from families to associations, and
to all of the people who tried a board-game for the first time in their life. </span></p>
<p>After focused and accurate tests, a lot of different
ideas and 5 years of hard work, that group of friends, with their passions and
skills, managed to create a game that is revolutionary in its kind, where a
player fights, laughts and smiles from the beginning to the end of the match, and
he can always make the right choice to win the game.</p>
<p><b>That group of friends is today the staff of M400</b>, and
they are trying to achieve an ambitious goal: the chance to show the world their
game and keep on following their dreams.</p>

<p>Some states (<em>Venetia, Luxeborg and Byzantium</em>) show
geographical organizations that are ""strange"" for a Board-game,<strong> but
they help strategical movements during the game</strong>. The game strategy is
completely rebuilt: <em><em><em><em>luck is just a small part of the match</em></em></em></em>, where the cards are
the main characters, with rules easily understandable even for children; the
ability to manage the deck has now the same importance as the movements of the
figures and the goals. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/597246/files/20140522083052-RepVenezia.jpg?1400772652"" src="""" style=""width: 590.66px; height: 443px;""/></p><p></p><p><strong>Every player can stay in the game till the end, and they

Non a caso la fine di questo secolo segna l’ingresso dell’umanità nella cosiddetta “era moderna”.<br/><br/>M400 nasce dall’idea di portare i giochi strategici ad un’ulteriore evoluzione; la scelta del suo nome e il riferimento storico al XV secolo non è casuale. Il secolo che ha visto la caduta dell’ultimo <br/>Impero Romano d’Oriente, la nascita della potenza spagnola e di quella inglese, l’ascesa delle repubbliche russe e le imprese della gloriosa Repubblica di Venezia, rappresenta lo sfondo ideale per concepire questo nuovo modo di divertirsi con la storia.<br/><br/>L’originalità del gioco è alla base della sua grafica accattivante: la plancia di gioco fonde in sé la rappresentazione fisica di un’Europa moderna con una divisione politica storicamente attendibile, seppur semplificata e in parte adattata alle esigenze del gioco strategico. <br/>L’aggiunta di carte di gioco tematiche e graficamente nuove, fa di M400 un gioco da tavola didattico in grado di rappresentare, visivamente e strutturalmente, la società, le tecnologie, la geografia e la storia del XV secolo.<br/><br/>M400 presenta un elevato grado di gioco in più giocatori, mentre l’utilizzo di carte permette di intervenire di volta in volta in maniera differente, creando partite mai uguali e mai ripetitive. Ogni volta che un giocatore si cala nel mondo tardo medievale del gioco, è in grado di riscrivere pagine di storia sempre differenti, attraverso commerci, battaglie, viaggi e rivoluzioni. La competizione e la strategia permettono, inoltre, di instaurare con gli avversari dinamiche di gioco che vanno oltre la schematizzazione di un regolamento: sotterfugi, bluff, <br/>alleanze segrete e silenziose. L’assenza di meccanismi basati sul caso, come ad esempio i dadi, riduce al minimo il verificarsi di condizioni favorevoli al giocatore legate esclusivamente al caso fortuito.<br/><br/>M400 è un gioco che concentra in sé elementi molto diversi tra loro, ma in grado di amalgamarsi e regalare ai suoi partecipanti un divertimento unico e mai scontato. E’ un gioco adatto a tutte le età e la scelta del latino come lingua grafica lo proietta verso l’universalità, come universale era il mondo antico rappresentato.<br/><br/><i>P.S.: E’ consuetudine per i giocatori di M400 salutarsi la mano sinistra aperta e pronunciando il termine benedettino “Benedicite” prima di iniziare la partita, per augurarsi un buon auspicio.</i><p></p><p><br/></p>

nata in una tipica serata invernale del gennaio 2009, quando un gruppo di
amici, stanco della monotonia e la ripetitività di alcuni giochi, ha cominciato
a discutere di idee, soluzioni, progetti e sogni nel cassetto.

<p>E così, un po’ per
gioco, è nato M400 e con il passare del tempo quelle piccole idee sono
diventate un progetto concreto, ma anche un sogno: quello di dare alla luce un
gioco da tavola in cui i giocatori si potessero sfidare a colpi di carte, dove
la fortuna fosse ridotta al minimo e dove per vincere fosse necessario dosare
al meglio abilità, strategia, astuzia, coraggio, rischio. Un gioco da tavola che
fosse adatto a tutti, dagli appassionati di storia agli amanti dei giochi di
combattimento e conquista, dai bambini agli adulti, dalle famiglie alle
associazioni, fino a tutti coloro che non hanno mai provato un gioco da tavola.
</p>
<p>Attraverso test mirati
ed accurati, numerose idee e 5 anni di duro lavoro, quel gruppo di amici,
ognuno con la sua passione e le sue capacità, è riuscito a dare alla luce un
gioco rivoluzionario nella sua tipologia, dove il giocatore lotta, ride e si
diverte, dall’inizio alla fine e ha sempre la possibilità di effettuare la
scelta giusta e di vincere la partita.</p>
<p>Quel gruppo di amici
costituisce oggi lo staff di M400 e cerca di raggiungere un obiettivo
ambizioso: avere la possibilità di mostrare al mondo il proprio gioco e
continuare ad inseguire i propri sogni.</p>

The union of history, art, strategy, entertainment and
passion, that’s what M400 was born from. A game of conquest, which revolves
around an important and defining historical period: the 1400.But this century is so much more than just a bunch of
years: it’s one of the most magnificent periods in the history of Italy and the
European culture. Because it’s not a coincidence if the end of this century
marks the beginning of the “Modern Age”.
M400 comes from the idea to bring strategic board
games to the next level; neither the name nor the historical references to the
XV century are just a fortuity. The century that saw the fall of the last
Eastern Roman Empire, the birth of the power of Spain and England, the ascent
of the Russian Republics, and the achievements of the glorious Republic of
Venice are the ideal background for the birth of this new way to have fun with
history.
M400 has a high level of playability with multiple
players, and the cards allow an always different gameplay, helping the creation
of new and different matches. Every time a player finds themselves in the late
Medieval period of the game, they can rewrite important pages of history in new
ways, through trades, battles, journeys and revolutions. The challenge and the
strategy also allow to create with the opponents new dynamics of gameplay
beyond the rules: deceptions, bluffs, silent and secret alliances. The almost
total absence of chances and coincidences, linked to the dices, reduces the
possibility of a player to win just by chance.
M400 is a game which contains very different elements,
elements that can mix, and give the player a unique and unpredictable kind of
entertainment. This game is for everybody, and the choice of the Latin makes it
reach a new level of universality, just like the one of the world of the XV
century.
                                  (M400 Preview at Lucca Comic's and Games,                                            one of the biggest game's fair in italy)

The creation of M400 started during a winter night
in January 2009, when a group of  friends,
tired of the dullness and the monotony of some board-games, started chatting
about ideas, solutions, projects and 
childhood dreams.
So, almost like by luck, M400 was born, and then
small ideas became a  real project and
also a dream: the dream to create a board-game where players could battle with
cards, where luck was just a small part of the game, and where you would have
to think and show your skills, your strategy, your cunning and your bravery to
win. A board-game suited for everyone, from history lovers to fight and
conquest game lovers, from children to adults, from families to associations, and
to all of the people who tried a board-game for the first time in their life. 
After focused and accurate tests, a lot of different
ideas and 5 years of hard work, that group of friends, with their passions and
skills, managed to create a game that is revolutionary in its kind, where a
player fights, laughts and smiles from the beginning to the end of the match, and
he can always make the right choice to win the game.
That group of friends is today the staff of M400, and
they are trying to achieve an ambitious goal: the chance to show the world their
game and keep on following their dreams.


- A Game Board with the ""Europe of the XV century"".

 - 10 wooden ""army"" figures in 5 different colors.- 75 wooden round ""State-marker"" and ""Point-marker"" tokens
in 5 different colors.- 20 wooden round ""Pestem"" black tokens.- 109 game freehanded drawn cards.- A Score Board.
- 
The
rules.
The cards of M400 are a mix of straight forwardness and beauty. Every
card is hand drawn by the M400 staff illustrators and it shows details of the
life, the society and of the world in the XV century. Its size 8.8 x 6.5 cm (Magic
standard), a symbol of quality, makes the deck easy to use without sacrificing
the beauty of the illustrations; the number displayed in the four corners makes
it easier to manage the cards; the rounded corners make the deck safer for the
children.                                                        (same size Magic's card)
The Game Board is a High Quality representation of
the Europe of the XV century, 50 x 70 cm. The historical setting and the ""old
looking"" graphic make the Board look like an ancient parchment, where you
can play with the wooden figures and at the same time learn and understand the
history and geography of Europe, taking the world of Board-games to the next
level.                                (the graphic evolution of the map over the years)                                               (the high detail of the sea)

The historical setting of M400 is based on an
accurate historical research made by the experts of the staff of the game. The
geopolitical organization of the Board shows the European states between the 1400
and the 1453, year of the fall of Constantinople, even though something had to
be changed to help the gameplay. Latin has been chosen as the official language
of the game, because it was one of the most important languages of the Europe
the the XV century. This choice represent another educational element and it
gave our staff the chance to create a game that can be played all over the
world.
Some of the features of this game are hardly found
in other board-games, and this make M400 a unique game of strategy and conquest.  
Some states (Venetia, Luxeborg and Byzantium) show
geographical organizations that are ""strange"" for a Board-game, but
they help strategical movements during the game. The game strategy is
completely rebuilt: luck is just a small part of the match, where the cards are
the main characters, with rules easily understandable even for children; the
ability to manage the deck has now the same importance as the movements of the
figures and the goals. Every player can stay in the game till the end, and they
can always regain points and win. M400 also has unique
cards (Pestem and Rivolutionem) which have unpredictable and very strategical
effects. The ""Alliance"" 2 player mode offers the most skilled players
a new experience of ability and entertainment. 

The staff really put a lot of effort in the creation
of the game in every detail and sustained the expenses for the realization of
prototypes and the launch of M400 during the
most important Italian Board-game exhibitions. Now we need you to bring M400 in
every house and to fulfill the dream of a unique game, which is the result of
beauty, knowledge and entertainment in a simply box.Your contribution will be precious for the creation of a high quality product (update 10 June)We could start the production of the first 1000 boxes to September 2014.If all goes well, we will be able to distribute the game in November and for this Christmas, also for the perks :)Thank you for your contribution.The following is the list of perks. Each perks has one or more objects for you to thank you for your generosity.Shipping Cost:The shipping costs are not included in the cost of perks. When your perks will be ready, we will contact you and when the shipment will be paid we will send you the object.Payment Method:The payment is processed through Paypal. Our initial goal is the minimum to begin the production of the game, but our staff has in the works several evolution for the original game.. help us to reach our successive goals ! $ 65.000 = M492 GoalWhen we'll reach the ""M492"" goal, our
staff will start developing the first Expansion Pack on M400. The historical
setting moves to the end of the XV century, to the age of the geographical

VERSIONE ITALIANA

… molto più di un gioco!




Dall’incontro tra storia, arte, strategia, divertimento e passione nasce M400, un gioco di conquista che ruota intorno ad un periodo storico molto importante e significativo: il 1400.Una data storica che rappresenta molto di più di una scansione temporale: dietro a queste quattro cifre si nasconde uno dei periodi storici di maggiore splendore per l’Italia e la cultura europea. Non a caso la fine di questo secolo segna l’ingresso dell’umanità nella cosiddetta “era moderna”.M400 nasce dall’idea di portare i giochi strategici ad un’ulteriore evoluzione; la scelta del suo nome e il riferimento storico al XV secolo non è casuale. Il secolo che ha visto la caduta dell’ultimo Impero Romano d’Oriente, la nascita della potenza spagnola e di quella inglese, l’ascesa delle repubbliche russe e le imprese della gloriosa Repubblica di Venezia, rappresenta lo sfondo ideale per concepire questo nuovo modo di divertirsi con la storia.L’originalità del gioco è alla base della sua grafica accattivante: la plancia di gioco fonde in sé la rappresentazione fisica di un’Europa moderna con una divisione politica storicamente attendibile, seppur semplificata e in parte adattata alle esigenze del gioco strategico. L’aggiunta di carte di gioco tematiche e graficamente nuove, fa di M400 un gioco da tavola didattico in grado di rappresentare, visivamente e strutturalmente, la società, le tecnologie, la geografia e la storia del XV secolo.M400 presenta un elevato grado di gioco in più giocatori, mentre l’utilizzo di carte permette di intervenire di volta in volta in maniera differente, creando partite mai uguali e mai ripetitive. Ogni volta che un giocatore si cala nel mondo tardo medievale del gioco, è in grado di riscrivere pagine di storia sempre differenti, attraverso commerci, battaglie, viaggi e rivoluzioni. La competizione e la strategia permettono, inoltre, di instaurare con gli avversari dinamiche di gioco che vanno oltre la schematizzazione di un regolamento: sotterfugi, bluff, alleanze segrete e silenziose. L’assenza di meccanismi basati sul caso, come ad esempio i dadi, riduce al minimo il verificarsi di condizioni favorevoli al giocatore legate esclusivamente al caso fortuito.M400 è un gioco che concentra in sé elementi molto diversi tra loro, ma in grado di amalgamarsi e regalare ai suoi partecipanti un divertimento unico e mai scontato. E’ un gioco adatto a tutte le età e la scelta del latino come lingua grafica lo proietta verso l’universalità, come universale era il mondo antico rappresentato.P.S.: E’ consuetudine per i giocatori di M400 salutarsi la mano sinistra aperta e pronunciando il termine benedettino “Benedicite” prima di iniziare la partita, per augurarsi un buon auspicio.
                                  (Presentazione di M400 a Lucca Comics and Games)
La creazione di M400 è
nata in una tipica serata invernale del gennaio 2009, quando un gruppo di
amici, stanco della monotonia e la ripetitività di alcuni giochi, ha cominciato
a discutere di idee, soluzioni, progetti e sogni nel cassetto.

E così, un po’ per
gioco, è nato M400 e con il passare del tempo quelle piccole idee sono
diventate un progetto concreto, ma anche un sogno: quello di dare alla luce un
gioco da tavola in cui i giocatori si potessero sfidare a colpi di carte, dove
la fortuna fosse ridotta al minimo e dove per vincere fosse necessario dosare
al meglio abilità, strategia, astuzia, coraggio, rischio. Un gioco da tavola che
fosse adatto a tutti, dagli appassionati di storia agli amanti dei giochi di
combattimento e conquista, dai bambini agli adulti, dalle famiglie alle
associazioni, fino a tutti coloro che non hanno mai provato un gioco da tavola.

Attraverso test mirati
ed accurati, numerose idee e 5 anni di duro lavoro, quel gruppo di amici,
ognuno con la sua passione e le sue capacità, è riuscito a dare alla luce un
gioco rivoluzionario nella sua tipologia, dove il giocatore lotta, ride e si
diverte, dall’inizio alla fine e ha sempre la possibilità di effettuare la
scelta giusta e di vincere la partita.
Quel gruppo di amici
costituisce oggi lo staff di M400 e cerca di raggiungere un obiettivo
ambizioso: avere la possibilità di mostrare al mondo il proprio gioco e
continuare ad inseguire i propri sogni.

 
- 
Plancia di gioco “Europa del XV secolo”;

- 
10 pedine “esercito” in 5 colori
differenti;
 
- 
75 pedine “segna-stati” e “segna-punti”
in 5 differenti colori;
 
- 
20 pedine “Pestem” di colore nero;
 
- 
109 carte da gioco disegnate a mano;

- 
Tabella punti;


- 
Regolamento.

Le
carte di M400 mescolano in sé praticità di gioco e bellezza artistica. Ogni
carta mostra un disegno realizzato a mano dai disegnatori di M400 e rappresenta
alcuni particolari della vita, della società e del mondo del XV secolo. Le
dimensioni 8,8 x 6,5 cm (standard Magic) rendono il mazzo maneggevole senza
limitare la bellezza dei disegni e rappresentano garanzia e qualità; il valore
numerico della carta inserito nei 4 angoli rende la gestione del mazzo più
semplice anche con molte carte a disposizione; gli angoli arrotondati rendono
sicure le carte anche per i giocatori più piccoli                                         (stessa dimensione delle carte di Magic)La plancia di gioco è
realizzata in alta qualità e dimensioni 50 x 70 cm, con rappresentazione
grafica dell’Europa del XV secolo. L’ambientazione storica e la grafica
computerizzata “antichizzata” trasformano la plancia in un’antica pergamena, in
cui si può giocare con le pedine, ma allo stesso tempo conoscere ed imparare la
storia e la geografia, portando il mondo dei giochi da tavolo ad un ulteriore
livello di sviluppo. 
                       (l'evoluzione grafica della mappa nel corso degli anni)                                               (il mare altamente dettagliato)
L’ambientazione storica
di M400 è basata su un’attenta ricerca storiografica compiuta dallo staff
qualificato del gioco. L’assetto geo-politico della plancia mostra gli stati
Europei tra il 1400 e il 1453, anno della caduta di Costantinopoli, seppur con
piccoli adattamenti per funzionalità di gioco. La lingua scelta per i nomi
delle carte da gioco è quella latina, universalmente riconosciuta ed utilizzata
in tutta Europa nel XV secolo. Questa scelta offre un ulteriore elemento
didattico e dà la possibilità al nostro staff di creare un gioco universalmente
utilizzabile in tutto il mondo.

Alcune caratteristiche
di gioco sono difficilmente ritrovabili in altri giochi da tavolo e fanno di
M400 un gioco di strategia e conquista unico nel suo genere. 

Alcuni stati (Venetia,
Luxeborg e Byzantium) mostrano dislocazioni storiche “strane” per un gioco da
tavolo, ma che aumentano gli spostamenti strategici all’interno della plancia.
La strategia di gioco viene completamente rivoluzionata: i combattimenti
vengono sottratti alla fortuna utilizzando esclusivamente le carte, secondo un
meccanismo molto conosciuto anche dai bambini; la gestione del proprio mazzo
diventa fondamentale a pari livello degli spostamenti delle pedine e la scelta
degli obiettivi. 

ogni giocatore rimane
in gioco dall’inizio alla fine della partita, con possibilità di recuperare
punti in classifica e vincere.
M400 presenta anche carte esclusive (Pestem e Rivolutionem) dagli effetti
imprevedibili e altamente strategici. La variante di gioco a 2 giocatori
“Alleanza” offre ai giocatori più esperti un ulteriore prova di abilità e
divertimento.

Finora il nostro staff
si è impegnato alla creazione del gioco in ogni minima parte e ha sostenuto le
spese per la realizzazione dei prototipi e la sua presentazione
nelle principali fiere italiane. Ora abbiamo bisogno di voi per portare M400 su
ogni tavolo da gioco e realizzare il sogno di creare un gioco dal carattere
unico, che concilia bellezza, conoscenza e divertimento in un’unica scatolola.Il tuo contributo sarà prezioso per la realizzazione di un prodotto di alta qualità (aggiornamento 10 giugno)
Inizieremo la produzione delle prime 1000 scatole per Settembre 2014Se tutto andrà bene, saremo pronti a distribuire il gioco per Novembre e per Natale, anche per i  perks :)Grazie del vostro contributo.Quella che segue è la lista dei perks (premi). Ogni perks porta uno o più oggetti per voi per ringraziarvi della Vostra generosità.Costi di spedizione:I costi di spedizione non sono inclusi nell' importo del perks. Quando il tuo perks sarà pronto, noi vi contatteremo e al momento del pagamento della spedizione vi invieremo l'oggetto.Metodo di Pagamento:Il pagamento è processato tramite Paypal. Il nostro goal iniziale è il minimo per iniziare la produzione del gioco, ma il nostro staff ha in cantiere diverse evoluzioni del gioco originale... aiutateci a raggiungere i nostri successivi  goals! $ 65.000 = M492 Goal
Espansione
M492

Al raggiungimento dell’obiettivo “M492”, il nostro
staff ha in cantiere la realizzazione della prima espansione di M400.
L’ambientazione storica si sposta alla fine del XV secolo, nell’epoca delle
scoperte geografiche e dell’ingresso del mondo nell’era moderna.

Nuove
capitali, nuove conquiste, nuove carte disegnate a mano, divertimento e
interazione tra i giocatori oltre ogni limite: un Nuovo Mondo per modi sempre
nuovi di giocare.

Working together, we can produce a fantastic event for adults and students in Columbus.<br/><br/>Created over a decade ago in San Francisco, Journey to the end of the night is a creative commons street game that’s been played in large cities around the world.  It's a massive game that combines elements of a 5k race with a scavenger hunt, all mixed with a game of tag.  Contestants race through the twilight streets of downtown Columbus, running from checkpoint to checkpoint completing tasks and trying not to get caught.  At the end there's a big party.<br/><br/>The event is held annually in places like Washington D.C., Chicago, Vienna, Budapest, Sydney, Australia, and, with your help, Columbus, Ohio--the 15th largest metropolis in the United States.<br/><br/>The event will be produced by Columbus Creative Cooperative, a local arts organization, in partnership with lots of Central Ohio businesses and organizations.  We also have help from Story Luck, an organization that has run a similar event in Chicago for many years.<br/><br/>A <i>ROUGAROU</i> is a creole version of a Werewolf.  This year's theme is based loosely on the book <i>Hagridden </i>by Samuel Snoek-Brown, which will be released this fall by Columbus Press.<br/><br/>Learn more about Rougarou: Journey to the End of the Night at <a href=""http://www.ColumbusJEN.org."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.ColumbusJEN.org.</a><br/>
</div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<p></p>
<h3>How the Game Works</h3>
<p>When you arrive at the event, you'll be given a map with the location of 5 checkpoints in the city. You'll have to make your way from checkpoint to checkpoint, completing a task at each one.  The task is normally a puzzle or something goofy, never anything hard.  Your job is to get through all five checkpoints and to make it to the end of the course.</p>
<p>But...there are Rougarous (werewolves) chasing you, trying to tag you.  At the beginning of the event, there will be only one tagger.  But if you get tagged, you also become a Rougarou yourself, and your job will be to tag other people.<br/></p>
<p>The truth is that being Rougarou is just as much fun as finishing the race.  To avoid being tagged, you can run, you can hide, you can use cunning and deception.<br/></p>
<p>If you take the shortest distance between all five checkpoints, you'll travel a total of about 5 kilometers, which you can reasonably walk in about an hour.  But, you make your own course, and you may find yourself taking longer routes to avoid getting tagged.  It's all up to you.  You may use public transportation.<br/></p>
<br/><h3>The Fundage<br/>
</h3> <p>We're seeking $1,000 to produce this event.  That money will be used for four primary purposes:<br/></p> <ul>
<li>
<b>Race Materials.  </b>We'll need to print maps, make headbands for teams, and other miscellaneous items to effectively run a great Journey to the End of the Night event.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Promotion.  </b>The more people we can get to an event like this, the more fun it is!  We need to print posters and flyers, host websites and more to get the word out about this event.</li>
<li>
<b>Props and Theatrics.  </b>There's a big difference between a cheap checkpoint, and one that's really invested in the theme.  In order to provide an immersive <i>ROUGAROU</i> experience, we'll need to spend some money on props, costumes and decorations for our event.<br/>
</li> <li>
<b>Closing Party.  </b>Venues, beverages, decorations--all of these things cost money, and they're all important to providing a really cool event.</li> </ul>

<h3>The Rewards</h3>
<p>Our rewards will help you spread the word about this awesome event, and to get into the Rougarou mood!</p>

<br/>Columbus Press will provide paperback pre-release copies of <i>Hagridden</i>, autographed by Samuel Snoek-Brown. This fantastic book is the best way to get in the mood to be chased by Rougarous.  Plus, it's the only way to get an autographed copy ahead of the book's official release date.  Books will need to be signed and shipped to you, but should arrive within two weeks of the close of this campaign.<br/><br/><p>If your company would like to sponsor this event, we'd be happy to feature your company name and/or logo on all of our printed and website materials.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>A Free Event<br/>
</h3>It's important to us that we offer this event to the general public for free.  But there's a reason that most 5k races charge $30-$60 to run--the costs really add up.<br/><br/>Only with your help can we make sure that we're producing a first-class event that will be 100% free to participate in.  Together, we can build a great event that's based on community, creativity and exploring our great city.<br/><h3><br/></h3>

Working together, we can produce a fantastic event for adults and students in Columbus.Created over a decade ago in San Francisco, Journey to the end of the night is a creative commons street game that’s been played in large cities around the world.  It's a massive game that combines elements of a 5k race with a scavenger hunt, all mixed with a game of tag.  Contestants race through the twilight streets of downtown Columbus, running from checkpoint to checkpoint completing tasks and trying not to get caught.  At the end there's a big party.The event is held annually in places like Washington D.C., Chicago, Vienna, Budapest, Sydney, Australia, and, with your help, Columbus, Ohio--the 15th largest metropolis in the United States.The event will be produced by Columbus Creative Cooperative, a local arts organization, in partnership with lots of Central Ohio businesses and organizations.  We also have help from Story Luck, an organization that has run a similar event in Chicago for many years.A ROUGAROU is a creole version of a Werewolf.  This year's theme is based loosely on the book Hagridden by Samuel Snoek-Brown, which will be released this fall by Columbus Press.Learn more about Rougarou: Journey to the End of the Night at www.ColumbusJEN.org.
  

How the Game Works
When you arrive at the event, you'll be given a map with the location of 5 checkpoints in the city. You'll have to make your way from checkpoint to checkpoint, completing a task at each one.  The task is normally a puzzle or something goofy, never anything hard.  Your job is to get through all five checkpoints and to make it to the end of the course.
But...there are Rougarous (werewolves) chasing you, trying to tag you.  At the beginning of the event, there will be only one tagger.  But if you get tagged, you also become a Rougarou yourself, and your job will be to tag other people.
The truth is that being Rougarou is just as much fun as finishing the race.  To avoid being tagged, you can run, you can hide, you can use cunning and deception.
If you take the shortest distance between all five checkpoints, you'll travel a total of about 5 kilometers, which you can reasonably walk in about an hour.  But, you make your own course, and you may find yourself taking longer routes to avoid getting tagged.  It's all up to you.  You may use public transportation.
The Fundage
 We're seeking $1,000 to produce this event.  That money will be used for four primary purposes: 

Race Materials.  We'll need to print maps, make headbands for teams, and other miscellaneous items to effectively run a great Journey to the End of the Night event.


Promotion.  The more people we can get to an event like this, the more fun it is!  We need to print posters and flyers, host websites and more to get the word out about this event.

Props and Theatrics.  There's a big difference between a cheap checkpoint, and one that's really invested in the theme.  In order to provide an immersive ROUGAROU experience, we'll need to spend some money on props, costumes and decorations for our event.
 
Closing Party.  Venues, beverages, decorations--all of these things cost money, and they're all important to providing a really cool event. 


The Rewards
Our rewards will help you spread the word about this awesome event, and to get into the Rougarou mood!

Our t-shirts are provided by Outfit Good.  They're high quality American Apparel shirts, printed right here in Columbus, Ohio, and they're so soft you'll want to have a baby just so you can wrap it up in one.  T-shirts will be shipped within one week of the end of this Indiegogo campaign.  T-shirts are available in heather black (gray) or gold.

Columbus Press will provide paperback pre-release copies of Hagridden, autographed by Samuel Snoek-Brown. This fantastic book is the best way to get in the mood to be chased by Rougarous.  Plus, it's the only way to get an autographed copy ahead of the book's official release date.  Books will need to be signed and shipped to you, but should arrive within two weeks of the close of this campaign.If your company would like to sponsor this event, we'd be happy to feature your company name and/or logo on all of our printed and website materials.

A Free Event
It's important to us that we offer this event to the general public for free.  But there's a reason that most 5k races charge $30-$60 to run--the costs really add up.Only with your help can we make sure that we're producing a first-class event that will be 100% free to participate in.  Together, we can build a great event that's based on community, creativity and exploring our great city.

The Leadership Team
Noah Firestone is a JEN aficionado.  He organized last year's event in Columbus, has assisted with the organization of the RAJEN event in Chicago for many years, and is a real smart dude.
Alan Files is a computer scientist.  He brings a lot of energy, know-how and resources to the team.
Brad Pauquette is a writer, and the founder and director of Columbus Creative Cooperative, one of the midwest's largest independent writers' groups.  He provides organizational support for the event, as well as a well of resources and volunteers.

Risks & ChallengesThe risks to this event are minimal.  If we don't reach our funding goal, we'll still put on an event, it just won't be nearly as cool.All of the funds will be collected and spent under the proven stewardship of Columbus Creative Cooperative, so you can be sure that 100% of the money raised will be used appropriately.  You can also be confident that the event will be executed as promised.

<p>After developing the initial concept of <em><strong>Medieval Mastery</strong></em> throughout 2010, Chaos Publishing was founded and Medieval Mastery underwent extensive development prior to a small initial release at the UK Games Expo, June 2011. This was the first edition of the game and only 200 copies were ever produced.</p>
<p>As this edition received such a great response from its release, we then decided to move to a larger scale production of 3000 copies, with multilingual support, improved artwork and high production values.</p>
<p>After lots of hard work, lessons learnt and money spent, we now have the new, multilingual edition in production, ready for its initial release at <strong>SPIEL 2012</strong> in Essen (October 18-21).</p>

<strong>Plan your campaign carefully</strong> - best taking advantage of all the interacting elements of the game ...as no two games will ever be the same!</li>

<p>Now, you’ve heard about the game and our story so... what brings us to indiegogo?</p>
<p>Well... we have put a lot into producing the game to high standards as well as into preparing the game for its initial release at <strong>SPIEL 2012</strong>. Because of this, we are now very low on funds and have very little to help further promote the game as well as deal with any unexpected costs we may experience as we head towards worldwide distribution.</p>
<p>We have also had plenty of interest from people wishing to pre-order this edition of the game and the indiegogo platform will allow those people to do just that.</p>
<p>We guarantee that we will fulfil all our perks and will send everyone their copies of <em><strong>Medieval Mastery</strong></em> prior to its retail release, expected <strong>this November</strong>.</p>
<p>We have many plans for the future, with a number of great games and expansions currently in development. Your support will help bring these games to life.</p>

After developing the initial concept of Medieval Mastery throughout 2010, Chaos Publishing was founded and Medieval Mastery underwent extensive development prior to a small initial release at the UK Games Expo, June 2011. This was the first edition of the game and only 200 copies were ever produced.
As this edition received such a great response from its release, we then decided to move to a larger scale production of 3000 copies, with multilingual support, improved artwork and high production values.
After lots of hard work, lessons learnt and money spent, we now have the new, multilingual edition in production, ready for its initial release at SPIEL 2012 in Essen (October 18-21).

Box cover art by Miguel Coimbra

During a game of Medieval Mastery, you will:


Advance your knights across the map - battling the other players for control of the land

Defend your territories from attack - enforcing your dominion over the region

Make use of your resources - to acquire reinforcements, plan tactical advances and disable your rivals’ artefacts

Attain special bonuses from artefacts - to gain insight, manage your hand and acquire advantages in battle.

Plan your campaign carefully - best taking advantage of all the interacting elements of the game ...as no two games will ever be the same!

Manipulate your opponents - with devious tactics and unexpected assaults, keep them on their toes and unsure of your plans.



In each box of Medieval Mastery, you will find:


3 Rule Books

1 English
1 German
1 French



39 Tiles (Hexes)

6 Castles
30 Territories
3 Lakes



126 Cards

6 Player Decks (of 18)
18 Artefacts



60 Six-Sided Dice (10 of each colour)
 

[$5.00] Card Sleeves: For each $5 you add to your perk level, you will receive a supply of 200 standard Mayday card sleeves to help protect your copy of Medieval Mastery (with 74 to spare!).

Now, you’ve heard about the game and our story so... what brings us to indiegogo?
Well... we have put a lot into producing the game to high standards as well as into preparing the game for its initial release at SPIEL 2012. Because of this, we are now very low on funds and have very little to help further promote the game as well as deal with any unexpected costs we may experience as we head towards worldwide distribution.
We have also had plenty of interest from people wishing to pre-order this edition of the game and the indiegogo platform will allow those people to do just that.
We guarantee that we will fulfil all our perks and will send everyone their copies of Medieval Mastery prior to its retail release, expected this November.
We have many plans for the future, with a number of great games and expansions currently in development. Your support will help bring these games to life.


There are other ways you can help besides making a contribution or pre-ordering copies of the game. Spread the word! If you think someone you know would be interested in the game, send them the link.
Want to keep up to date with all our latest news and updates? Why not like us on Facebook or follow us on Twitter?
We hope you choose to contribute to our project and thank you for your support!

</ul><p></p></div>","Potions: A Curious Tale is an adventure-crafting game where your wits and ingenuity are your greatest weapons, and combat is not always the answer. Play as Luna, a young witch who overcomes obstacles with the potions she brews.Encounter fairy tale characters and stories from around the world in new settings and situations as you guide Luna on her quest to become a potions master.Growing up is hard, and it’s even harder when you’re a witch! As Luna, you’ll solve devious puzzles and battle monsters with your arsenal of mystical potions. With a little help from your grandmother (a powerful witch in her own right), you’ll explore enchanted lands inspired by your favorite fairy tales – often with an unexpected twist!As powerful as your potions are, you’ll find yourself up against monsters that can shrug off your most powerful attacks. You’ll have to think on your feet and act quickly to sidestep danger. Manage your resources carefully, or you may find yourself with an empty satchel when you need your elixirs most. Ever wonder what happened after Miss Muffet was frightened off her tuffet?""Put the kettle to the meddle.""
Conflict resolution that goes beyond pure combat—calm, charm, tame and scare your enemies
Strategic combat—use potions, the environment, and even other monsters to defeat your enemies
Quirky storyline featuring rich characters from folklore around the world – all with a unique spin
Crafting system that rewards experimentation
Countless environments to adventure and search for rare ingredients
Resource management, with a vast number of potions and ingredients
Luna—Your resident witch-in-training and strong, female lead
Beautiful, illustrated art style reminiscent of your favorite storybooks and animated tales
""Potions: A Curious Tale is a wonderfully charming visual delight that promises a tongue-in-cheek storyline and lovely characters. While still in its early stages, gamers who love crafting and exploration should keep an eye on this game.""  - SIX Judge“What struck me most about Potions: A Curious Tale is the beauty of the sprites used throughout it.” - Spong“Potions: A Curious Tale makes players re-think the standard hack-n-slash, kill-the-monster gameplay.” - MMORPG ""It brought back a sense of nostalgia -- it reminded me of a cross-breed of old school games."" - SIX Judge""Something wicked, this way. Fun!""Combat is fast-paced, non-linear, and highly customizable. Set your own play style with the potions you use and the way you choose to face threats. Go full-throttle with an arsenal of deadly potions that burn enemies to ashes, or drop a confetti bomb and escape before they can blink. Potions’ effects can work together, allowing for powerful combinations of different attacks. They can also trigger helpful and deadly reactions in the environment. Timing is key, any pause taken in battle to throw one of your potions leaves you vulnerable as your enemies barrel down upon you. You’ll have to time attacks just right to take down tougher enemies. All potions are friendly-fire, so be careful where you point that incendiary vial! Some creatures will even need to be coaxed by other methods to share their goods. You must think carefully about which monsters to engage with and which to avoid or trick. Sometimes, using your enemies against each other is the most efficient solution. Get too carried away fighting and you’ll use up your precious potions and have to re-arm before your next adventure. ""Every problem... has a solution.""On Luna’s path to master potion brewing, she must gather rare ingredients to craft new potions. While her grandmother will teach her some potion recipes, most recipes must be discovered through experimentation with ingredients. Each ingredient has descriptive text that hints towards its potential use. These descriptions, along with additional hints from characters in the game, can lead Luna to craft undiscovered recipes. Luckily, Luna also learns from her failures. So, while an unsuccessful experiment may ruin her ingredients, it also provides her insight that will lead to the discovery of new recipes as her skills grow.If she’s just refilling her potion satchel, Luna can use her trusty recipe book, where she records all of her previous concoctions. Luna must manage her potion supplies by avoiding unwanted trouble and exploring to find ingredients for recipes, or go out and hunt exotic monsters to gather rare ingredients for experimentation! Enchanted creatures, large and small, dwell in the forests, caves and mountains around Old Haven. Some are harmless or even benevolent. Others are licking their chops at the prospect of having a lovely young witch for supper.Each creature in the Deep Dark Forest has its own strengths and weaknesses. While your potions of flame may burn spiders to ash, they’ll have little impact on the lava-loving salamander. Think of each creature you encounter as a tiny puzzle, with abilities, vulnerabilities, and behaviors you can exploit to your strategic advantage (and monetary gain).Although many monsters hold the ingredients you need to brew more powerful potions, most will be reluctant to part with them. Some may be persuaded by force, others by charm, still others by guile. It’s up to you to brave the wilderness while using tricks, cunning, and an arsenal of arcane connections to win the components you’ll need to become a potions master.A good witch chooses her battles wisely! Remember, not every creature needs to be defeated, and picking the wrong fight may be the difference between being the cook and being the meal.""Go stir crazy!""Not only will your wits and potions help you with the monsters you encounter on your adventures, they will also be key to solving the countless puzzles strewn across the lands. Some obstacles will need a special potion to pass, while others will require creative problem solving to unlock their secrets! Hidden items are scattered all over this mystical land, so don’t be surprised if any rock or thicket conceals a hidden artifact or ancient potion recipe forgotten over the ages. Even your talks with characters can unveil important pearls of wisdom. Luna lives in a world inspired by fairy tales and folklore from around the globe, from African folklore to Western nursery rhymes. Luna's wit and intellect help her overcome challenges posed by these enchanted lands. However, in her quest to become a Potions Master, she also learns important coming-of-age lessons in the tongue-in-cheek story line. Respect is earned, advice can be deceiving, and adults aren't always right. Luna never quite fit in with her peers as she was always off exploring and experimenting. When one of her experiments explodes spectacularly, Luna learns that she has an aptitude for brewing magical potions. Unable to train Luna herself and desiring to keep the young girl out of further trouble, Luna’s mother sends her to live with her grandmother to learn potion crafting. Granny lives in a small village to the north on the edge of the Deep Dark Forest. Her little town, Old Haven, is the last stop for adventurers on their way to find fame, fortune, and glory in the enchanted lands beyond. A respected Potions Master, Granny has more than enough business selling potions and remedies to the townsfolk and travelers. However, with her advanced age, she is happy to take on an apprentice who can venture into the enchanted forests, mountains, deltas, and grasslands on her behalf. Whether it’s helping Mary Muffet with a spider problem or assisting the monk, Tripitaka, and his unlikely crew of disciples on their pilgrimage, Luna finds a way to lend a hand with her cunning wit and, of course, her potions. Full Release The full release will be available for Windows, Mac, and Linux via direct download (DRM-free) and Steam.Alpha/Beta Access Access to the alpha and beta will be granted on Steam for Windows initially, with Mac to follow.

<div>
<p>Currently, a good adventure videogame means one single-player through one main story-line. If you want another story in the same setting, you have no choice but wait for the sequel, pay the full price and so on. No interactivity with others players. No re-use of your character attributes in the sequel. On the other hand, computer RPGs, mainly Third or First Person Shooter, are too focused on developing skills and accumulating items to the detriment of the richness and the complexity of stories. What are called ""quests"" are widely nothing but pretextes to hack and slash or to shoot-shoot-shoot. To top it all off, the social part is too constrained by Guilds.<br/> Aas a matter of a fact, from our point of view, the most important has been lost: social interactivity <strong><em>while</em></strong> story-telling. <em>In others words, today a video game player can not make his character grow in a story-telling oriented and persistent world</em>.<br/> Exactly the opposite of pen and paper RPGs.</p>

<p><strong><span class=""HighlightTitle"">Game views:</span></strong></p>

<li>The game experience tends to get closer to real life tabletop RPGs sessions, so the views (except the Hacking view) will be <span style=""color: rgba(45,45,45,1); font-weight: 600;""><span class=""HighlightText"">tactical tabletop inspired</span></span>.</li>
<li>The visual tests we've made absolutely convinced us that the aesthetics and the NeoNoir/Cyberpunk ambiance of ""THE NOISE UNDER"" (interiors, exteriors, characters) will be best rendered while using <span style=""color: rgba(45,45,45,1); font-weight: 600;""><span class=""HighlightText"">hand-drawn technics</span></span>.</li>
<li>The game experience supposes a big urban territory which narrates the city and offers a wide range of locations, of characters, of situations to build exciting stories. Doing this using 3D is much more expensive (5 to 6 times), but provides nothing more to the most important: the adventures.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, for those different reasons, the game views will be <span style=""color: rgba(45,45,45,1); font-weight: 600;""><span class=""HighlightText"">fully 2D</span></span>.</p>

<p>""THE NOISE UNDER"" concept is really <span style=""color: rgba(45,45,45,1); font-weight: 600;""><span class=""HighlightText"">new</span></span> with a revolutionary narrative system (with the adventure shop and different types of adventures) and a gameplay which includes <span style=""color: rgba(45,45,45,1); font-weight: 600;""><span class=""HighlightText"">hacking, crafting and reputation features</span></span>, all of that in a persistent world. The completed territory will be huge (about 100Km2), so will be the <span style=""color: rgba(45,45,45,1); font-weight: 600;""><span class=""HighlightText"">in-game Net</span></span>. There will be a plenty of NPCs, locations, items. That means hours and hours of narrative experiences.<br/> To keep the game as close as possible to the original concept, it is fundamental for us to have the last word, the ""final cut"" on the development, the graphical and gameplay decisions while keeping the deadlines in mind. We want to market the game at <span style=""color: rgba(45,45,45,1); font-weight: 600;""><span class=""HighlightText"">""the right price""</span></span> and don't want to answer to anyone but you, the player-customer. So we decided to ask for support. With a crowdfunding campaign, we can ask directly to people, to players, to customers. You and us will be closer, the relationship will be more transparent by frequent reporting and showing on how the dev goes, more interesting by showing you the way we build the project.</p>
""The Noise Under"" will be <span style=""color: rgba(45,45,45,1); font-weight: 600;""><span class=""HighlightText"">membership-based</span></span>. A membership will grant the member an access to <span style=""color: rgba(45,45,45,1); font-weight: 600;""><span class=""HighlightText"">3 adventures to choose a month</span></span>, whatever the length. The first release of ""The Noise Under"" will come with a little more than <span style=""color: rgba(45,45,45,1); font-weight: 600;""><span class=""HighlightText"">100 adventures</span></span>. Then this initial stock will be enriched on a <span style=""color: rgba(45,45,45,1); font-weight: 600;""><span class=""HighlightText"">continuous flow </span></span>.</div>

</div></span></div>","""THE NOISE UNDER"" is NeoNoir/Cyberpunk. That means ultra-capitalistic dystopia with credible high tech. It's about moral dirt. It's about networks, biotech and cybernetics. It's about escape. It's about raw and rusted aesthetic, not as an objective but as a consequence. It's about surviving. It's about do-it-yourself and recovery technology. It's about necessity which knows no law. It's about loneliness and death at every corner. Unlike so much colourful-chromed-luminous cyberpunk RPGs, ""THE NOISE UNDER"" is not cool. It's bleak. It's rough. It's do-or-die.

""THE NOISE UNDER"": A NARRATIVE MMO RPG






Currently, a good adventure videogame means one single-player through one main story-line. If you want another story in the same setting, you have no choice but wait for the sequel, pay the full price and so on. No interactivity with others players. No re-use of your character attributes in the sequel. On the other hand, computer RPGs, mainly Third or First Person Shooter, are too focused on developing skills and accumulating items to the detriment of the richness and the complexity of stories. What are called ""quests"" are widely nothing but pretextes to hack and slash or to shoot-shoot-shoot. To top it all off, the social part is too constrained by Guilds. Aas a matter of a fact, from our point of view, the most important has been lost: social interactivity while story-telling. In others words, today a video game player can not make his character grow in a story-telling oriented and persistent world. Exactly the opposite of pen and paper RPGs.






YBERIS cityscape downtown (Concept art)





NARRATIVE: The heart of ""THE NOISE UNDER"", what will focus most of our efforts and be a big part of the budget, is what we call the adventures. An adventure is an interactive fiction, as it exists in legacy pen and paper RPGs, with a strong storyline, great NPCs (some of them being recurring characters), goals and missions. We structured three different lengths of adventure corresponding each to the time needed to achieve it: short, intermediate and long. An adventure can be one-shot or it can be part of a series spanning several seasons (like tv programs). The adventures will be created by our narrative team and published on the in-game adventure shop.





QAZ - ""Babylon street"" (Concept art)





RPG: ""THE NOISE UNDER"" is tactical, not based on physical reflexes. It's turn-based during interactions and fights.No class system: you'll be what you do and the way you do it. Your skills as well as your reputation will change according to your succeeded or failed past actions and will influence those to come, for better or for worse. Your objective is to survive.

You'll need to eat, to rest in a safe place and to get healed.
You'll have to equip yourself.
You'll have to get people to teach you how to do things (crafting, hacking systems...).
...

Most of the time, you'll be paying (in-game currency) for all of that. So you'll need to rent out your skills, to traffic and smuggle because the only way to make money is to dive into the underground economy.





QAZ - a back street (Concept art)





MMO: Your narrative experiences will take place in the backstreets and the cut throat bars of QAZ, in the ultraprotected arcologies of YBERIS, or in the devasted land of REB and its buried research labs.


Open world: The adventures you'll live will make you explore about 100km2 (size of the fully designed world, excluding the interiors). Private interiors will be accessible according to your skills, the adventures you lived or you're living.

Persistent world:  The world will continue to evolve and to change even if you're not connected.

No PVP or PVE modes:  Only one unique world in which things happen through adventures or not.

No guild system:  If you want to build a team, you'll just have to hire team mates (NPCs or real players) or simply play with friends. You'll be able to share the same narrative experience through the cooperative adventures which have been designed for that purpose.

Continuity of game session:  For example, you're will be able to start playing on your PC or MAC and continue your game session on your tablet. The only rupture will result from logout-login process. To benefit from this feature, you'll just have to install the relevant game client on both systems.






REB cityscape (Concept art)





Game views:

The game experience tends to get closer to real life tabletop RPGs sessions, so the views (except the Hacking view) will be tactical tabletop inspired.
The visual tests we've made absolutely convinced us that the aesthetics and the NeoNoir/Cyberpunk ambiance of ""THE NOISE UNDER"" (interiors, exteriors, characters) will be best rendered while using hand-drawn technics.
The game experience supposes a big urban territory which narrates the city and offers a wide range of locations, of characters, of situations to build exciting stories. Doing this using 3D is much more expensive (5 to 6 times), but provides nothing more to the most important: the adventures.

So, for those different reasons, the game views will be fully 2D.






Technology: Even if the game views are heavily 2D, ""THE NOISE UNDER"" application (composed by user-side and server-side softwares) will mainly rely on UNITY4, the fantastic game development framework.
Languages: From the first release, ""THE NOISE UNDER"" and all the adventures will be available in both English and French.
Hardware and O.S.: Windows, MacOsX, Linux, Android tablets, Ipad, thanks to UNITY4.

WHY DO WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT?





""THE NOISE UNDER"" concept is really new with a revolutionary narrative system (with the adventure shop and different types of adventures) and a gameplay which includes hacking, crafting and reputation features, all of that in a persistent world. The completed territory will be huge (about 100Km2), so will be the in-game Net. There will be a plenty of NPCs, locations, items. That means hours and hours of narrative experiences. To keep the game as close as possible to the original concept, it is fundamental for us to have the last word, the ""final cut"" on the development, the graphical and gameplay decisions while keeping the deadlines in mind. We want to market the game at ""the right price"" and don't want to answer to anyone but you, the player-customer. So we decided to ask for support. With a crowdfunding campaign, we can ask directly to people, to players, to customers. You and us will be closer, the relationship will be more transparent by frequent reporting and showing on how the dev goes, more interesting by showing you the way we build the project.
""The Noise Under"" will be membership-based. A membership will grant the member an access to 3 adventures to choose a month, whatever the length. The first release of ""The Noise Under"" will come with a little more than 100 adventures. Then this initial stock will be enriched on a continuous flow .




HOW MUCH DO WE NEED?





The budget for a complete world and full features is between $2,5 to $3 millions (depending on the degree of outsourcing). We ask for $500,000 as an initial goal to build the fundations and the basic gameplay. But we need to raise $1,650,000 to have 100% of the gameplay features and 50% of the open world. That will enable us to hire the relevant people and contractors to do this right, essentially writers and 2D artists/illustrators.

<p>
In
the 90's, The Crystal Maze, was one of the UK's favourite television
shows. Now we're planning for it to return as a live immersive
experience right in the heart of London!</p>
<p>
You'll
get to play the maze just as contestants did on the original show -
placing you at the centre of the action. What we really want, is for
people to live the magic of the hit television programme for
themselves.</p>
<p>
We
will be lovingly recreating the famous set just as it was on the
original show. All four famous zones will be present; Aztec,
Medieval, Industrial and Futuristic, not forgetting of course, The Crystal Dome!</p>
<p>
We are delighted to be announcing the return of none other than the legendary Maze Master himself, Richard O'Brien! Richard won't be running around the maze himself, but he will be welcoming guests in time honoured fashion... to find out how, you'll just have to come along and see!</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
Audience
members will compete in teams, guided by their own personal Maze Master. Each
contestant will play games that test their intelligence, skill,
physical ability and mystery...ness. At the experience's finale, each
team will be rewarded for the amount of games they have won by
converting crystals into precious time in the Dome.</p>
<p>
You
will be invited to form teams of 8. Don’t worry if you are a group
of 1 or 2, we'll find you some excellent team mates to tackle the maze
with. You can also hook up with your friends even if you pledge
individually.</p>
<p>
4
teams will then enter the maze at once, moving through each zone before regrouping at the end to take on the Dome.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>
Depending
on how many crystals you collect, (remember 5 seconds per crystal!), you will have your allotted time in the Dome to collect as many
golden tickets as possible. Every winning team will get a place on
our leader board and win a fantastic prize. </p>

Modern audiences want to do, not watch. In recent years, there has been a cultural shift towards entertainment that audiences can engage with in a more active way. More and more we are finding new audiences who want to experience, interact, and play as opposed to watch.
</div>
<div>The Crystal Maze represents the perfect opportunity to do something for this new audience on a grand scale. That same audience who want more active entertainment are the ones who watched The Crystal Maze growing up- making this not just an innovative idea, but a dream come true for many people, including us!</div>

If you're reading this then you were probably alive in the 90’s and
therefore obviously watched The Crystal Maze religiously. At first
the venue will be 18+ and for adults only but in time we will open it up for

Crystal Maze wisdom.</p><div>

<p>Crowdfunding was a very deliberate decision because we wanted you guys to be involved from the very start. By pledging your support, you will become part of the team that brought back The Crystal Maze. You can also get yourself a ticket, so you can be one of the first to play the Maze. We have been approached by venture capitalists and angel investors but our preferred business partner is the British public. We want the fans to be the ones to bring back The Crystal Maze. Together we can bring back the greatest game show of all time for everyone!</p>

<p>
The
main cost is without doubt the set - building a land of wonder and
amazement for everyone to enjoy. No expense will be spared as we rebuild the Maze in all it's former glory. With such a
large project, there are inevitably lots of other costs as you can see in our lovely 'Crystal' pie chart below. But really it's all about building the
most beautiful set possible for you guys.</p>

Challenges
are definitely the name of the game. We've been working on this for a
year already and it has been quite the roller-coaster so far. We are sure
there will be more challenges to come, not least building the maze,
but with our team and skills we are confident that no crystal will be
left behind.</p>
<p>From the reaction we've had so far, we can tell how much this means to people and we are just as passionate as all of you guys about this project. There will certainly be difficulties ahead but we owe it to all of us to bring back The Crystal Maze. So whatever happens the show will go on!</p>

In
the 90's, The Crystal Maze, was one of the UK's favourite television
shows. Now we're planning for it to return as a live immersive
experience right in the heart of London!

You'll
get to play the maze just as contestants did on the original show -
placing you at the centre of the action. What we really want, is for
people to live the magic of the hit television programme for
themselves.

We
will be lovingly recreating the famous set just as it was on the
original show. All four famous zones will be present; Aztec,
Medieval, Industrial and Futuristic, not forgetting of course, The Crystal Dome!

We are delighted to be announcing the return of none other than the legendary Maze Master himself, Richard O'Brien! Richard won't be running around the maze himself, but he will be welcoming guests in time honoured fashion... to find out how, you'll just have to come along and see!

Audience
members will compete in teams, guided by their own personal Maze Master. Each
contestant will play games that test their intelligence, skill,
physical ability and mystery...ness. At the experience's finale, each
team will be rewarded for the amount of games they have won by
converting crystals into precious time in the Dome.

You
will be invited to form teams of 8. Don’t worry if you are a group
of 1 or 2, we'll find you some excellent team mates to tackle the maze
with. You can also hook up with your friends even if you pledge
individually.

4
teams will then enter the maze at once, moving through each zone before regrouping at the end to take on the Dome.




Depending
on how many crystals you collect, (remember 5 seconds per crystal!), you will have your allotted time in the Dome to collect as many
golden tickets as possible. Every winning team will get a place on
our leader board and win a fantastic prize. 





Modern audiences want to do, not watch. In recent years, there has been a cultural shift towards entertainment that audiences can engage with in a more active way. More and more we are finding new audiences who want to experience, interact, and play as opposed to watch.

The Crystal Maze represents the perfect opportunity to do something for this new audience on a grand scale. That same audience who want more active entertainment are the ones who watched The Crystal Maze growing up- making this not just an innovative idea, but a dream come true for many people, including us!




YOU!!!
If you're reading this then you were probably alive in the 90’s and
therefore obviously watched The Crystal Maze religiously. At first
the venue will be 18+ and for adults only but in time we will open it up for
families and young’uns so we can pass down that all important
Crystal Maze wisdom.






Crowdfunding was a very deliberate decision because we wanted you guys to be involved from the very start. By pledging your support, you will become part of the team that brought back The Crystal Maze. You can also get yourself a ticket, so you can be one of the first to play the Maze. We have been approached by venture capitalists and angel investors but our preferred business partner is the British public. We want the fans to be the ones to bring back The Crystal Maze. Together we can bring back the greatest game show of all time for everyone!





The
main cost is without doubt the set - building a land of wonder and
amazement for everyone to enjoy. No expense will be spared as we rebuild the Maze in all it's former glory. With such a
large project, there are inevitably lots of other costs as you can see in our lovely 'Crystal' pie chart below. But really it's all about building the
most beautiful set possible for you guys.





The venue is at a secret location in central London, but rest assured it will be easily accesible to all!
    
 

Challenges
are definitely the name of the game. We've been working on this for a
year already and it has been quite the roller-coaster so far. We are sure
there will be more challenges to come, not least building the maze,
but with our team and skills we are confident that no crystal will be
left behind.
From the reaction we've had so far, we can tell how much this means to people and we are just as passionate as all of you guys about this project. There will certainly be difficulties ahead but we owe it to all of us to bring back The Crystal Maze. So whatever happens the show will go on!



 

If
you can't contribute but you still love The Crystal Maze don't worry
- you can still help!

Please
share this page and get involved on social media. The more people we
get involved the bigger and better The Crystal Maze will be!

</h3>
<p><strong>Scylla Games</strong> is proud to present <strong>Nine Lives</strong>, a retro styled platform game for Windows, Linux, Mac and iOS (and perhaps an Android version, if there is enough interest).</p>
<p>The game features a tiny kitten, <em>Felina</em>, and her journey across the four corners of the globe to find her kidnapped mother.</p>
<p>Battle across twenty-five vast levels, spread over five worlds, populated by dozens of creepy critters, from land-dwelling cephalopods, snakes, bats, ogres, spiders and zombies, to the most heinous and insidious of them all, the evil water droplet.</p>
<p>In each world, you will face your fears, as you oversome all the obstacles, navigating dark tunnels, jumping over thoughtlessly placed spikes, switching on rattling mechanical platforms and discovering secret portals. In each level, you must find the sacred key, which is your only chance to escape the wild areas.</p>

<p>And as you progress through each world, you will gain <em>mew</em>, er I mean new, abilities, such as shooting fireballs, hovering and clinging to walls. Learn to use these new skills to face the fresh challenges that await.</p>
<p>At the end of each world, you will face the deadliest enemy each world has to offer. Cunning, pernicious guardians that lie in wait to put an end to your quest.</p>
<p>Do you have what it takes? Can you help Felina stay alive long enough to find and rescue her mother. Or will you fall victim to the harsh, wild world, and end up as just another meal for a vicious animal. Remember, cats only have nine lives.</p>

<h3>About me</h3>
<p>Scylla Games is a one man show. My name is Dale and I have been an indie developer for just over a year now. I have a background in the games industry and in academia, in the fields of robotics and computer graphics. Ever since I got my first computer at the age of 10 (a feeble zx spectrum with a whopping 48k of RAM) I have always been both a gamer and programmer. I have over a dozen games on the apple app store, but this is my first game where I am branching out to other platforms.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Why retro?</h3>
<p>I remember my first gameboy, you know the big chunky white thing with monochrome graphics, a yellow screen, and a battery life of a picosecond. It was a christmas present when I was 14. I had 3 games, Gremlins 2, Tetris and Gargoyle's quest. Ah great days!</p>
<p>Since that time I have worked on many games, large and small, but I always look back on my early days of gaming with very fond memories, and retro games hold a very special place in my heart.</p>
<p>I wanted to bring that feeling of nostalgia to this game, and with crisp, monochrome graphics, a quirky chiptunes soundtrack and simple-to-learn-but-hard-to-master gameplay, I feel that I have succeeded. But I'll let you be the judge of that.</p>

<h3>How you can help</h3>
<p>The work for the game is mostly done, it is at alpha stage. But the last stretch of a game is always the hardest. With your help, I will be able to see it through and shell out for things like promotional materials, more music, website and other associated fees.</p>
<p>Becoming a backer of this game will earn my undying gratitiude. You will help me continue my dream of creating the kinds of games I want to make and play.</p>
<p>You can help by donating, even a small amount goes a long way to helping make this game a reality. Donate now and get the game before anyone else, and if you want to be part of beta-testing, you can get very early access to the game.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Mike and this is the first game among my projects that i`m trying to give life to.</p>
<p>For the last 10+ years i was excessively modding various games (Sword of The Stars, UFO Aftershock, Starsector, Silent Storm etc.) and some of you might even know me under my nickname Okim or are familiar with my ACM and Ironclad mods.</p>
<p>I also participated in development of Endless Space PC game as a VIP member of community (a beta tester and an active member of game elements discussions), so i have some Space gaming experience in my pockets.</p>
<p>This campaign is about a board game that i`m currently actively developing. Its a Space 4x table top game with hexagonal map, detailed ship tokens, random events and encounters, traditional resources (food, minerals, research) and customisable ships. Its about choices that a leader of a newborn spacefaring empire has to make in order to achieve prosperity and wealth to his people and secure it from aggressors.</p>
<p><img alt=""Game board"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.okim.nickersonm.com/MY/pic01-sm.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Game board""/></p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Goals of This Campaign</h3>
<div>This particular campaign is started to raise funds for an artist. All graphics in the game are currently done by me - all planets, stars, ships, tokens and other stuff was either crafted in Photoshop or in Illustrator. But i`m not an artist and i can`t create proper race portraits that my publisher requests me to have.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I`m working on this game solo and i don`t have enough money to pay for a set of 7 race portraits and a several large scale drawings, so that`s where your contributions will mostly go. Excess funds will be used to further improve the game, here are the certain improvements that LS will get for reaching the listed sums:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>$1000</strong> - all 7 races will receive high quality portraits and full descriptions in rulebook. The game will also get a set of unique resources on specific colonies. Resources will provide an empire-wide bonus to the player who controls a colony on a planet with that resource.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>$2500</strong> - rulebook and the box will be decorated with high quality images of various space events, battles and just beatiful scenes. A set of three leaders per race (21 in total) will be added to the game. Leaders provide a specific local bonus to a fleet or a colony where it is assigned to.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>$5000</strong> - an additional silicon based race and set of all required tokens, hexes and cards to support 6 players.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>$10000</strong> - senate and voting will be added to the game.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Other goals may be added to this campaign. I`ll make an undate once i`m ready to propose a new goal...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>Now when i`m getting your contributions</strong> - i`ve started ordering the arts. Below is the list of all race portraits currently done with some description for them. I`ll add new races as soon as i get them done.</div>

<div>
<p>Avis are large, noble looking eagle-like creatures. They evolved on an arid planet called Nar-Avis that has significantly lower gravity than we have on Earth.</p>
<p>Avis are capable of flight on their own. That helped them to move the arts of piloting air-borne and spacecrafts to a very high level unreachable by other races. All Avis from the very youth are trained to be a pilot. Flight is the most important part of Avis culture and only the best pilots are allowed to take high positions in Avis society.</p>
<p>Avis are peaceful and curious. They had very few wars in their history and usually try to resolve conflicts via diplomacy.</p>
<p>In game terms Avis get the fastest ships that can travel further from their colonies (without the need to research techs that allow to do that for other races). They also get one of the most powerful fighters and some of their ships are allowed to carry fighter wings.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Races - Vargars</strong></h3>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/716007/pictures/full/20130321055923-pic22.jpg?1363871030"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p>Vargars are brutal warriors with keen senses, exceptional strength, agility and toughness. Their society is ruled by clans, but this ruling can`t be called centralised - most of the time clans are busy fighting for power and supremacy making.<br/><br/>Vargars` technological progress was very slow until they managed to shot down an Avis scout orbiting over their homeworld Vargad. Due to this event the galaxy has learned the horrors of Vargars and their bloody conquests.<br/><br/>Vargars never retreat as their Warrior`s Code prohibits this. Vargars almost never establish any diplomatic  contacts with other races except for demanding surrender and tributes.<br/><br/>In game terms Vargars have the bets troops and experienced ship crew (leading to accuracy bonus). Their cruisers and battleships can carry troops for free.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The races - Hivenids.</strong></h3>
<p><img alt=""Hivenids"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.okim.nickersonm.com/MY/hivenids.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Hivenids""/></p>
<p>This insectoid race is ruled by a hivemind. While Queen controls global affairs and rules the Homeworld - all the other colonies are deligated to her loyal daughters.</p>
<p>Hivenids are the best farmers and workers in the known sector of this Galaxy. Their sheer numbers and direct psionical connection of each worker to his Queen or Princess ensures that each task is accomplished precisely as it was ordered.</p>
<p>Queen and Princess emit a powerful psionic field that connects the whole colony and its surroundings in a vast network of minds where tasks, orders and reports are transmitted instantly.</p>
<p>The only drawback of the Hivenids and their hivemind is that there is little place for scientific discoveries in it as sheer numbers of the Hivenid workers rarely encounters tasks that they can`t fulfil with their mass.</p>
<p>In game terms Hivenids get bonus to food and mineral production, but have a limit on how much reserach they can ever generate. All Hivenids colonies have extra defenders should another players launch an invasion on any of their worlds.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The races - Wurmis.</h3>
<p><img alt=""Wurmis"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.okim.nickersonm.com/MY/Wormis_Final_02.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Wurmis""/></p>
<p>Wurmis are quite unusual species closely resembling oversized terran ringed worms. Wurmis have no arms, legs or other manipulator, so its really a mystery how these creatures managed to evolve into a spacefaring civilisation.</p>
<p>Wurmis live in huge underground cities and rarely come out to the surface. Even spaceports on all Wurmis colonies are underground-based.</p>
<p>Wurmis biology is very remarkable. Their metabolism and cell regeneration are extremely fast making growth period from a larvae into a fully developed creature just a matter of several month.</p>
<p>Wurmis can easily survive wounds that could instantly kill members of other species. This includes heavy burns, loss of 75% of the body and loss of most of its blood.</p>
<p>The only thing that Wurmis are afraid of - is ultraviolet raditation. That`s why they always wear protective suits when moving to the planet`s surface.</p>
<p>In game terms Wurmis get the cheapiest colonists and their troops can ressurect after they were killed.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<h3>Exploration and Random Events</h3>
<div>The map in Lords of The Stars consists of several hexes. Each hex represents a star system or a deep space object like nebula or black hole. Hexes have two sides - a Star type (or a Deep Space sign) on one side and its contents on the other side. All hexes are placed on the map with their Star/Sign side up. Players set up the map by putting hexes in turns around the core world - this allows them to either secure some good worlds close to their starting position or spoil other player`s sector by putting poor worlds in his vicinity.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div><img alt=""Hexes"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.okim.nickersonm.com/MY/stars.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Hexes""/></div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Each star type contains different types of planets. For example - Orange stars always contain at least one terran type planet and Blue stars contain at least one mineral rich planet. The worst and poorest stars are Red - there is a chance to get absolutely no planets/asteroids in those.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>To see what a hex contains - a player needs to send his ships there. Once they reach the hex - it is considered to be explored. Player flips the hex with its contents up and takes a Random Encounter card. There are two types of card - standard (that contain something valuable) and dangers (that always contain a dangerous foe).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>  <img alt=""Random Encounters"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.okim.nickersonm.com/MY/pic09.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Random Encounters""/>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Each game turn a first player takes a random event card and follows its description. Randoms add a feeling of uncertainty to the game as a simple ship explosion event can devastate the whole your expansion efforts by randomly killing your transport with colonists. But don`t you worry - the majority of events are good or neutral and some of them are very valuable (such as a population boom that makes your colonists cheapier to build for the following several turns). </div>

<div><img alt=""Random Events"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.okim.nickersonm.com/MY/pic10.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Random Events""/></div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Exploitation</h3>
<div>The game has 4 resources. They are - food, minerals (industry), research and fleet command points.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>FOOD. The majority of planets in Lords of The Stars can`t support themselves and rely on agricultural colonies to sup ply them with food. Each such colony deducts 1 food from empire food production pool. Only agricultural colonies can produce food.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>MINERALS. These are used to build ships, buy and install modules, construct stations, train troops and colonists. Only industrial colonies and mines (stations) can produce minerals. Most of the planets that contain rich mineral deposits require food for their colonies.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>RESEARCH. You need this 'resource' to develop new technologies. Techtree has 8 levels with each containing 2 pairs of techs. If you research one of the techs - you`ll lose access to its pair. This is the main part of the game where players are forced to make hard choices (for example - there is a pair of techs that can increase mineral production of your colonies or increase reserach output - a tough choice, isn`t it?). Only research colonies can generate science points.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>FLEET COMMAND POINTS. Each ship in this game consumes some amount of fleet command points, so you can`t have a large armada without a proper support for it. Each colony produces a fixed amount of FCP regardless of its type, so the larger your empire is - the greater you armada. There is a strict cap for FCP, so even the grandest empires can`t field endless amounts of ships. This is also a second major part where players are forced to make choices according to their needs, techs and race abilities - sometimes its better to have a fleet of 6 fast destroyers than a couple of cruisers or a single battleship (each type consumes its own amount of FCP!).</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div><img alt=""Economics"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.okim.nickersonm.com/MY/pic12.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Economics""/></div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<h3>Expansion</h3>
<div>Each player can create 4 types of colonies on any planets that they can reach. There is a limit on how far from your colonies and stations your ships can fly. This values is 1 hex by default, but can be increased by tech advances and ship modules.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Colony types are: agricultural for food production, inductrial for mineral harvest, research for generating science points, construction for building ships. The numbers of each type are limited by 3, so once again there is a choice of what colony to set up.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Certain worlds (called extreme) require a specific tech to allow colonisation. These are the richest worlds in the game.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Players can build 3 types of stations on any asteroids that their transports can reach. These stations can be either mines (that produce minerals), missile bases that provide a system-wide defence for the player or listening post that acts as a flees command pointsgenerator and system-wide accuracy booster.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<h3>Extermination</h3>
<div>This is the most interesting part of the game. Each player can have ships, fighters and troops with which he can defend his empire or wage war with the other players.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Each ship type (there are destroyers, cruisers, battleships, transports and fighters) has its own unique role. Battleships are space-superiority ships capable of crushing enemy fleets alone, cruisers excel in support roles (they can damage enemy before the actuall fighting begins), fighters are great against battleships, and destroyers are good for hunting down fighters. Transports are universal carriers and can transport troops, fighters and colonists.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Players can improve their ships by installing modules on them. These modules effect all the ships on the type they are installed on. There are plenty of various modules providing bonuses to all various ship stats. Players can even customise a ship to become a fully functioning troop carrier or a fleet accuracy booster).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Invasions are the main way to remove colonies from other players. You need troops to take over the planets and cruisers/battleships to soften the defenders. But colonies are not so easy to take over - each of them has a powerful defence battery that can fend off small and medium sized invasion fleets (or simply take off troop carriers and thus prevent invasions).</div>
<div> </div>

<div>
<img alt=""Ships"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.okim.nickersonm.com/MY/pic11.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Ships""/> </div>
<div> </div>
<h3>Victory Conditions</h3>
<p>The goal of the game is to be the first to accumulate certaing number of victory points. VPs are gained by many various things such as colonisation, random events (ratings) and monster hunting. But the most prosperous ways to get VPs is to launch an invasion on other player. There is another way for those who prefer peaceful gaming - a set of mission cards with various easy and difficult objectives. These are the last part of the game that forces players to make choices. Most of the missions are based on very different economic achievements that can`t be reached simultaneously or are really difficult to do so. </p>

</div></div>","Introduction
Hello, my name is Mike and this is the first game among my projects that i`m trying to give life to.
For the last 10+ years i was excessively modding various games (Sword of The Stars, UFO Aftershock, Starsector, Silent Storm etc.) and some of you might even know me under my nickname Okim or are familiar with my ACM and Ironclad mods.
I also participated in development of Endless Space PC game as a VIP member of community (a beta tester and an active member of game elements discussions), so i have some Space gaming experience in my pockets.
This campaign is about a board game that i`m currently actively developing. Its a Space 4x table top game with hexagonal map, detailed ship tokens, random events and encounters, traditional resources (food, minerals, research) and customisable ships. Its about choices that a leader of a newborn spacefaring empire has to make in order to achieve prosperity and wealth to his people and secure it from aggressors.

full sized picture can be found here: http://www.okim.nickersonm.com/MY/pic01.jpg 
 
The Goals of This Campaign
This particular campaign is started to raise funds for an artist. All graphics in the game are currently done by me - all planets, stars, ships, tokens and other stuff was either crafted in Photoshop or in Illustrator. But i`m not an artist and i can`t create proper race portraits that my publisher requests me to have.
 
I`m working on this game solo and i don`t have enough money to pay for a set of 7 race portraits and a several large scale drawings, so that`s where your contributions will mostly go. Excess funds will be used to further improve the game, here are the certain improvements that LS will get for reaching the listed sums:
 

$1000 - all 7 races will receive high quality portraits and full descriptions in rulebook. The game will also get a set of unique resources on specific colonies. Resources will provide an empire-wide bonus to the player who controls a colony on a planet with that resource.
 

$2500 - rulebook and the box will be decorated with high quality images of various space events, battles and just beatiful scenes. A set of three leaders per race (21 in total) will be added to the game. Leaders provide a specific local bonus to a fleet or a colony where it is assigned to.
 

$5000 - an additional silicon based race and set of all required tokens, hexes and cards to support 6 players.
 

$10000 - senate and voting will be added to the game.
 
Other goals may be added to this campaign. I`ll make an undate once i`m ready to propose a new goal...
 

Now when i`m getting your contributions - i`ve started ordering the arts. Below is the list of all race portraits currently done with some description for them. I`ll add new races as soon as i get them done.
 
The Races - Avis


Avis are large, noble looking eagle-like creatures. They evolved on an arid planet called Nar-Avis that has significantly lower gravity than we have on Earth.
Avis are capable of flight on their own. That helped them to move the arts of piloting air-borne and spacecrafts to a very high level unreachable by other races. All Avis from the very youth are trained to be a pilot. Flight is the most important part of Avis culture and only the best pilots are allowed to take high positions in Avis society.
Avis are peaceful and curious. They had very few wars in their history and usually try to resolve conflicts via diplomacy.
In game terms Avis get the fastest ships that can travel further from their colonies (without the need to research techs that allow to do that for other races). They also get one of the most powerful fighters and some of their ships are allowed to carry fighter wings.
 
The Races - Vargars

Vargars are brutal warriors with keen senses, exceptional strength, agility and toughness. Their society is ruled by clans, but this ruling can`t be called centralised - most of the time clans are busy fighting for power and supremacy making.Vargars` technological progress was very slow until they managed to shot down an Avis scout orbiting over their homeworld Vargad. Due to this event the galaxy has learned the horrors of Vargars and their bloody conquests.Vargars never retreat as their Warrior`s Code prohibits this. Vargars almost never establish any diplomatic  contacts with other races except for demanding surrender and tributes.In game terms Vargars have the bets troops and experienced ship crew (leading to accuracy bonus). Their cruisers and battleships can carry troops for free.
 
The races - Hivenids.

This insectoid race is ruled by a hivemind. While Queen controls global affairs and rules the Homeworld - all the other colonies are deligated to her loyal daughters.
Hivenids are the best farmers and workers in the known sector of this Galaxy. Their sheer numbers and direct psionical connection of each worker to his Queen or Princess ensures that each task is accomplished precisely as it was ordered.
Queen and Princess emit a powerful psionic field that connects the whole colony and its surroundings in a vast network of minds where tasks, orders and reports are transmitted instantly.
The only drawback of the Hivenids and their hivemind is that there is little place for scientific discoveries in it as sheer numbers of the Hivenid workers rarely encounters tasks that they can`t fulfil with their mass.
In game terms Hivenids get bonus to food and mineral production, but have a limit on how much reserach they can ever generate. All Hivenids colonies have extra defenders should another players launch an invasion on any of their worlds.
 
The races - Wurmis.

Wurmis are quite unusual species closely resembling oversized terran ringed worms. Wurmis have no arms, legs or other manipulator, so its really a mystery how these creatures managed to evolve into a spacefaring civilisation.
Wurmis live in huge underground cities and rarely come out to the surface. Even spaceports on all Wurmis colonies are underground-based.
Wurmis biology is very remarkable. Their metabolism and cell regeneration are extremely fast making growth period from a larvae into a fully developed creature just a matter of several month.
Wurmis can easily survive wounds that could instantly kill members of other species. This includes heavy burns, loss of 75% of the body and loss of most of its blood.
The only thing that Wurmis are afraid of - is ultraviolet raditation. That`s why they always wear protective suits when moving to the planet`s surface.
In game terms Wurmis get the cheapiest colonists and their troops can ressurect after they were killed.

<p>Final Days: A Crystal &amp; Steam Adventure harkens back to a simpler time, where story and characters were placed above fancy graphics, advanced lighting effects, and PhysX engines. With this project, I plan to present a solid game with engaging characters, a story full of intrigue and adventure, and an experience that can be savoured and enjoyed.</p>
<p>You will play from the perspective of an apprentice Steamsmith, Samuel, who is striving to learn his craft. Unfortunately, like most adventures, things begin to get strange very quickly and nothing is what it seems on the surface.</p>
<p>You will travel through crowded, steam-cloaked streets, visit temples of crystal and stone, explore the dark, nearly-forgotten sewers beneath the city, and even stranger locales! </p>
<p>Beyond the story and characters, the game will feature:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>an exhaustive crafting system</strong>, combining different ingredients to create tools, contraptions, and even clothing, that will be needed to solve many of the puzzles and progress the story</li>
<li>
<strong>meaningful choices</strong> that can alter the flow of the story and have far reaching consequences</li>

Final Days: A Crystal & Steam Adventure harkens back to a simpler time, where story and characters were placed above fancy graphics, advanced lighting effects, and PhysX engines. With this project, I plan to present a solid game with engaging characters, a story full of intrigue and adventure, and an experience that can be savoured and enjoyed.
You will play from the perspective of an apprentice Steamsmith, Samuel, who is striving to learn his craft. Unfortunately, like most adventures, things begin to get strange very quickly and nothing is what it seems on the surface.
You will travel through crowded, steam-cloaked streets, visit temples of crystal and stone, explore the dark, nearly-forgotten sewers beneath the city, and even stranger locales! 
Beyond the story and characters, the game will feature:


an exhaustive crafting system, combining different ingredients to create tools, contraptions, and even clothing, that will be needed to solve many of the puzzles and progress the story

meaningful choices that can alter the flow of the story and have far reaching consequences

optional paths of adventure that further expand upon and explore the lore of the city and the people in it

 


 The Crystals were there long before us. Beneath the waves is where we found them. From there, we brought them to the city and studied them with our greatest minds. In them, there was discovered a power that could rival even the great influence of the Steamworks.
The Keepers, as the scholars who studied them came to be called, received their chance to prove this as word reached the city that our enemies came in a grand fleet from across the sea. In desperation, the Council came to them as the Steamsmiths could find no way to stave off the impending annihilation. From the Crystals they sought salvation... and so it was given.
Through their manipulation of the crystals, the Keepers took a drastic course that would change the very nature of our city forever. They raised the city from the surface of the waters and as our enemies closed in for the kill, we disappeared into the clouds themselves.
As the city rose, so did the influence of the Keepers. For their aid, they were given honored status and license to expand their studies into further uses of these powerful gems. Their presence grows even now, outward from the source within the Crystal Temple and they vie for dominance of the city against the Steamsmiths.

oceanic planet, such as crustaceous life forms and mechs that Viper has left
behind after his influence. </p>
<p><b>Talos 4</b> is a barren ice wasteland. Not only are the native
creatures deadly, there are giant indigenous people. Take this barren ice
wasteland very carefully.</p>
<p><b>Izo</b> is a lush jungle planet. Don’t take this planet lightly,

Redshift is now available on Android devices from the Google Play store! Link here!https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Big4Production.Redshift&hl=enRedshift is currently in review by Apple and we will be sharing that link as soon as it becomes available!~Big4ProductionHey everyone thank you so much for the great campaign and all of the support. We are hard at work to get Redshift done and out within the next few months. We will post big updates in here and our website www.big4production.com, otherwise to keep up with everything we are doing check out our Facebook and other social medias.Thanks again for the great campaign and we will get Redshift out as soon as we can. ~Big4ProductionHere is our newest Pre-Alpha Testing of Redshift. We hope you enjoy. This contains game play from the first Planet of Redshift.Big4Production has been working in the mobile games industry for a year and a half, and we really believe that Redshift is going to be the game that will launch us into creating games full time. In order to make Redshift the game that will make that dream possible, we are going to need your help. By contributing to this project you will not only be helping us make this great game but also contributing to the future of Big4 as a company and the quality of our future products. 
20+ Levels
Multiple weapon types
Accelerometer based Mini games
Painted art style
Full length original soundtrack 
Dynamic Boss battles 
Interactive and immersive level selection

There
are many different enemies in Redshift, each with their own custom look and
animations. Besides the grunt enemies there are also epic bosses. Each of
these bosses has their own custom fights. But be careful when facing these
bosses they don’t die very easy.
Below are two enemies from Redshift. The crustaceous life
forms of planet Triton, and the giant indigenous people of Talos 4. 
There are four different planets that you can travel to in
Redshift. 
Triton is a water-based planet. This is the first planet you
travel in your pursuit of Viper. There are many different obstacles in this
oceanic planet, such as crustaceous life forms and mechs that Viper has left
behind after his influence. 
Talos 4 is a barren ice wasteland. Not only are the native
creatures deadly, there are giant indigenous people. Take this barren ice
wasteland very carefully.
Izo is a lush jungle planet. Don’t take this planet lightly,
not only are the indigenous people deadly, the plants are as well. This lush
jungle will put you to the test you better be well prepared. 
Minoroth is a planet that is now covered with cites. This is
where Viper has his base of operations. There are mechs and traps everywhere;
you have to be extremely cautious. 
Redshift is being developed with the use of Unity3D. With this great game engine we are going to be able to release to both the major mobile platforms Android and IOS.

 
Previously, we have been working on other mobile games. While Redshift was waiting in the wings, getting worked on a little bit at a time. In this time we have taken breaks on Redshift and focused on other games and vice versa. Some of the mobile games that we have finished in this time have been. 
                            Illusion of the Wind                Bad Christmas

   

                                 Sweet Escape                     Temple of Romu
  
  
Each of these games have been a stepping stone for Redshift. For example we couldn't do our 2D movement and our more advance GUI without Illusion, Temple and Bad Christmas. All of these mobile games that we have done have been  great stepping stones, but now we are ready to work on Redshift full time. This is where you come in. Here is an update showing you the design of some of our 3d miniatures. These are miniatures of some of the enemies encountered in Red Shift and are available to you as a perk for donating.   The following is a breakdown of everything we need to make Redshift everything that it can be. Below is a graph of where our funding goes, this will include the funds that we raise from our campaign. As you can see from our chart, any and all funds collected will be used to improve the quality of Redshift. This also includes cross platform license fees, sound recording gear, office expenses, and testing devices.  

We wouldn't be crowd-funding without any perks! All of our contributors will get something back from us in the form of a physical or digital perk. Donation amounts!
$1 = A Personal Thank You Email.
$5 = Your name in the Credits
$10 = 2 Digital Wallpapers
$25 = Sound Track
$50 = Digital Artbook
$75 = 3D Miniatures  
$100 = Early Game Access + Comic
Please check out the perks section on the right hand side of the page to see a detailed explanation of what each perk is about. We also have a plan to make Redshift even better if we reach a monetary amount higher than our original goal.

I used to be a software developer, but then followed my passion into the stock market. Whilst doing that, i worked on my other passion, a mobile device game idea i came up with a few years ago. I was about to commission someone to build it (as i don't do this sort of programming), when the GFC hit. Unfortunately, i had too much (not that i ever had a great deal to begin with) invested in the stock market and was left pretty much penniless. Oh well, c'est la vie. At least i still have food on the table. <br/><br/> The game itself is simple, meant for just passing the time, if your at a bus stop or waiting for a friend or just sitting around, bored. Easy to get started and easy to finish up. There is no violence or sexual themes, just good wholesome fun, not meant to be too complex, fun for all ages. However in saying that, the first few levels will be easier, so at least the more novice or younger players still get to enjoy it, but as you get through the first few levels, it will pose a challenge for the more adventurous at heart. </p>

I used to be a software developer, but then followed my passion into the stock market. Whilst doing that, i worked on my other passion, a mobile device game idea i came up with a few years ago. I was about to commission someone to build it (as i don't do this sort of programming), when the GFC hit. Unfortunately, i had too much (not that i ever had a great deal to begin with) invested in the stock market and was left pretty much penniless. Oh well, c'est la vie. At least i still have food on the table.  The game itself is simple, meant for just passing the time, if your at a bus stop or waiting for a friend or just sitting around, bored. Easy to get started and easy to finish up. There is no violence or sexual themes, just good wholesome fun, not meant to be too complex, fun for all ages. However in saying that, the first few levels will be easier, so at least the more novice or younger players still get to enjoy it, but as you get through the first few levels, it will pose a challenge for the more adventurous at heart. 
The game is a bubble game, with lots of player interaction, similar play to Fruit Ninja, but the game is completely different. 
Your contributions will directly help fund the games production, marketing and legal costs.  Everyone needs a dream, something to believe in, to work toward, a passion, otherwise what's the point.What We Need & What You Get The amount i'm asking for is enormous ($16,500) and i honestly feel terrible asking other people to give up money for something to me, however there just is no other way at this point in time. If you do find it in your heart to donate to my cause, i promise i will fulfill my end of the deal and i simply wont be able to thank you all enough..  The money will go towards these things: Legal work - protecting the game from copycats and also the developer.. don't want him stealing it.  Building the game - (the second largest cost) a professional developer will be commissioned, as i can't do it Marketing - (bulk of the cost) a never ending pit, creating pre-release buzz, getting the game out to reviewers and bloggers.  No monies will be used for living or other expenses, the games development and release will take all of it, plus what i've already put in. A $5 donation will get you an electronic version of the rules and a screen dump of a random game level, pre-release, so you get to see the game before the world does and of course, a huge thank you and my absolute gratitude. A $25 donation will get you the same as $5 donation plus a mention in the credits.  A $150 donation will get you the same as $25 donation plus your initials will be displayed on screen as a character is removed.  If i don't reach the total donation amount, any monies received will first go to legal costs, that way i can spread the word without too much concern. Then anything left over will go to the games development. The Impact Although i have never had to do it for myself, i've manged a few software development projects, from conception to delivery.

<p> </p>
<p>Gameolith (<a href=""http://www.gameolith.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title=""Gameolith - The Linux Game Download Store"">www.gameolith.com</a>) is a game download store for Linux.

<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;""><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Ludum Dare 26 Jam Entry</span></span></h3>
<p>This April, we set out along with many thousands of other excited game developers from across the world, amateur and professional alike, to create a game over the course of a single weekend.  The event, Ludum Dare, is a global game jam, and ostensibly a competition, but everyone gets the same prize: the opportunity to create a game and share it with the world.  Our prize was a game called Aduno, and we're quite excited about it!</p>
<p>First thing's first, though - if you <em>haven't</em> heard of Ludum Dare before today, please stop what you're doing and <a href=""http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-26/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">check out the games!</a>  We're biased to our game, of course, but there are so many other spectacular entries (Over 2,000!), it would be a shame if ours was the only one you played!</p>
<p>Okay, now that that's said: you can play the competition version of Aduno for free today.  Play it here: <a href=""http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-26/?action=preview&amp;uid=3128"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Aduno: Ludum Dare 26 Entry</a>, or click the Gallery tab above for downloads.</p>
<h3>Where We Stand Today</h3>
<p>With very positive reception so far, and a number of requests from fellow competitors to create a mobile version of the game, we're looking to fully polish and complete Aduno, and optimize the presentation of the game with mobile phones and tablets in mind.  We have all the ability and motivation we need to do so, but we're looking for a bit of help with the basic costs of getting there.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We don't need much to get started - we're not looking to take time off from our day jobs or for extra cash in our pockets at the end of the day.  The costs for us to bring Aduno to Android and iOS are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>$399 for a <a href=""http://xamarin.com/monotouch"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Xamarin.iOS/MonoTouch</a> license, which will allow us to release Aduno on iOS.  The framework we are using (<a href=""http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LibGDX</a>) allows for a speedy and relatively painless release on iOS, but we need to purchase a MonoTouch license first.</li>
<li>$99 for an iOS developer license, a requirement to publish on the App Store, and $25 for an Android developer registration.</li>
<li>~$400-500 for a nice web domain - this will give us somewhere to host the desktop version of Aduno, news about the game, and also to provide support and have a web presence for Aduno, as well as any future creations of ours.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are able to front some of this cost ourselves, but not all - that's why we're hoping we can receive just a tiny push from the community to help us get where we're going.  Even just a dollar would be much appreciated, and very helpful.</p>
<p>Thanks for checking out Aduno, and thanks for supporting events like Ludum Dare!  Now <a href=""http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-26/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">go play a few more Ludum Dare entries!</a></p>

<h2>Anybody knows the story about the mysterious incident that should have happened at the old Mansion in the forest some years ago...</h2>
<p><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://stadt.heim.at/berlin/110116/intro2.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>A Meteorite hit near the old Mansion. The genius professor who lived there with his family went instantly insane. He was driven by this extraterrestrial, who used him for his evil plan to destroy the world.<br/>The professor even hijacked a young girl, called Sandy.<br/>This was his big mistake. A group of some courageous children who only wanted to save their friends life then saved our world.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://stadt.heim.at/berlin/110116/timmy.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is the story that is still told to all children who aren't well-behaved.<br/>But... ""Thats all fucking shit!!"", thought the ten years old little kid Timmy.<br/>Today was the first working day in his young life. He really wanted to earn some money to get this new cool Playstation 3 ""Modern Warfuck"" Edition. It was hard for him to persuade his mother, that he can deliver the newspapers.</p>
<p>After some hard working hours and ten miles on foot there was only one New York Dimes left to deliver. But this last Magazine was addressed for the Old Mansion! Timmy still remembered the words of his mother: 'Take you job seriously, boy! If you throw only one newspaper away you'll get fired! I will ask everywhere if they got a newspaper!'.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://stadt.heim.at/berlin/110116/szene3.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></p>
<p>Fearfully he went down the road to the old mansion. Just before the entrance of the building he stopped. What the hell! He was totally shocked. The door opened very slowly. He didn't know what he was seeing.</p>
<p>There was an evil looking green monster, looking like the tentacle that he saw in a friends computer game out of the stoneage some weeks ago. This thing began to talk! 'Hey kid, do you got something to eat for me??' 'WAHHH!' Timmy cried and ran away.</p>
<p>He lost his last newspaper on the way, lost his job then. <br/>His mother was frustrated cause she thought the child was using drugs, like all other boys in the neighborhood.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://stadt.heim.at/berlin/110116/detlef.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/>Only Timmy's Uncle, the self claimed ""Ghost Hunter"" Detlef Digger, believed the words of the boy. Sure he did! Detlef is a former police officer, and worked in the drug department.<br/>Unfortunately he got fired because he consumed all confiscated drugs over years.</p>
<p>In his life he always believed anything from aliens to the illuminati. Maybe the drugs were far too much.<br/>He was ten years without a job. Then the mid-30 though it could be a good idea<br/>to make himself independent. So nowerdays he walks from one retirement home to another to find more mad old people who believe that they need a ghost hunter. Fore sure after a lot of persuading and maybe with the help of a friend who like fasching costumes.</p>
<p>One night Detlef sat in his cellar office. He though how he could expand his ""customer range"". Then an old woman called Detlef and cried for help.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://stadt.heim.at/berlin/110116/omagesicht.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/>This Old woman told him something about kidnapping, strange acting persons, a slimy creature who has bulimia, a telefonbook where she got his number in the section and she mentioned the old Mansion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://stadt.heim.at/berlin/110116/buerosketched.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>Of course she also talked about ... Adolf Hitler... the rubble women after the end of world war two... her own war imprisonment and how russian soldiers died while raping her ... her twenty cat's in the last 60 years ... and more bullshit. <br/><br/>To be gentle Detlef listened to her monolog until he heared a load scream and someone hang up the phone.</p>
<p>Detlef realized that there must be a connection in what Timmy told him and this... There must be something going on in the Old Mansion.!</p>
<p>So Detlef decided to visit the old Mansion. In the same Night he started his journey into the biggest Adventure of his Live.</p>
<p> </p>

<h2>There were two different opinions in our team.</h2>
<p>One part of us think that this crowd-funding idea is great and offers the possibility for people like us to launch a huge project. Thats just the opinion of some of us.</p>
<p>The other opinion was, that it seems to some of us, that only some already known people (who got huge success in the entertainment business already) have a chance to realise a well funded project here.</p>
<p>One of us said : ""It's entirely utopistic to even think of it. All the funded projects and people behind use all possibilities, like existing contacts in the business, an already huge set-up community or a lot of money to promote a project. The people that should profit from the crowdfunding project can't profit from it.""</p>
<p>But we don't share the same opinion in this matter, and thats okay. <br/>We discussed this topic for a long time. In the end we decided to give it a try.</p>

<p>In this times, it would be financial suicide for us to borrow any (more) money from banks. Most of us also got a family to feed, a ""normal"" everday job and we were and are not able to do something of this scale alone.</p>
<p>So if at least one of us can quit the normal job and make this project like it should be (a year of fulltime work on it...) we need an alternative.</p>
<p>And there it came one day that one of us told the rest that there is this new crowdfunding website, where new projects get funded. Indiegogo with it's independent development community could be what we needed... maybe.</p>

<h2>The team under Simon's supervision want to develop a classic point-and-click adventure game.</h2>
<p>The development would take place in a period of one year.<br/>Our success isn't making lot's of money, but to ""sprout"" during the process of creating the game we always wanted to make. At least one of us also have really would like to quit the present job to work on the project fulltime.</p>
<p>Thanks to the possibilities of the internet today (with high speed data transfer), we don't have to work in one place all the time. So a rented office is not urgently required. But we need at least the money to meet up with all members at least once in a week.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://stadt.heim.at/berlin/110116/achmed.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>Also we need to hire more full time or part time graphic artist. <br/>We want to get them paid for the work, so we could expect the results <br/>that we want to get. They are needed to get the huge amount of artwork done. <br/>Also one of us is looking forward to train a bit with them :) <br/>He can and already had scetched lot's of stuff that we got in mind. He is a bit <br/>capable of colorization. But he did his work in the past when the highest resolution was 320x240 pixel. So he can ""pixelate"", but we want a game in a modern high resulution.</p>
<p>Our main goal is to attract the gamer with highly professional voice acting.<br/>That's something that will be expensive. We really want to hire some of the known talent to do the synchronization of the ingame speech.... <br/>So there are costs to hire this talent and the soundstudio. <br/>Also we need english voice actors.</p>
<p>The game should be released in german and english language.<br/>So some assistance with translating all texts into the english language is required... If you read our text until now you know why ;)<br/>We also want to pay a fee for this work, because at some point we need to get the german source script translated with all dialogs and that's huge.<br/><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://stadt.heim.at/berlin/110116/kindneu.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/>Furthermore we need money for a new domain and the webtraffic for a release, an appealing new website, of course the franchise articles for our supporters, licensed sounds, maybe some advertising, the license of a special game engine that we prefer to use and many other little things.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://stadt.heim.at/berlin/110116/amount.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></p>
<h2>Every amount of money for this project is great!</h2>
<p>With more funding, we can ""walk faster and better"" towards our goal. We think that we need at least around 10.000$. That's the money to get the game done in around 1 year, like we got it in mind (e.g. pay additional pro-staff for graphic-arts and voice overs).</p>
<p>Less money means less capabilities. We need more time, it's much harder to get the huge artwork done, we can't get our engine licensed and so on.</p>
<p>But it's great to get more funding than needed,  because this only means more improvement in many ways.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://stadt.heim.at/berlin/110116/pamela.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/>A much higher funding could mean...:</p>
<p>---&gt;  Maybe we could rent an office building</p>
<p>---&gt;  Some of us (or maybe all) could quit their normal daily job to work fulltime</p>
<p>---&gt;  We could hire more extra staff. This means a lot more animations, artwork and a lot of cutscenes as well as even more game content</p>
<p>---&gt;  We could port it to Mac Platforms, iOS and Android Platforms and Linux as well</p>
<p>---&gt;  A Translation into more languages is passible: French, Spanish, Italian, Russian</p>
<p>---&gt;  We can get the best possible voice-over artists for all languages</p>
<p>---&gt;  We could deliver the game also as a boxed version, with a Printed Game Manual and a nice poster.</p>
<p>---&gt;  We could advertise for the game on a big scale, like ads in game magazines</p>
<p>---&gt;  We could think about doing another game....</p>

<h2>There is this list on the right side, please have a look.</h2>
<p>Something that is very important for us is to ensure that every one who donate a small contribution get the game. So anyone who donate at least 5$ get the digital copy (download possibility) of the finished game.</p>
<p>You would get some rewards as fast as possible (like a T-Shirt, Mousepad, Poster etc.) Some other rewards need some time, like the soundtrack and something like this.</p>

<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://stadt.heim.at/berlin/110116/intro1.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/>This means that we let all backers discuss the project with us.<br/>There will be a point, when we need to hear your thoughts and feelings about the game's content and direction that we want to show you in this community.<br/>So we plan on votings on decisions when we think it could help. <br/>Some Backers will also have access to a tech-demo, alpha and beta version, once they are available.</p>
<h3>We can't specify at this point that we sell a real boxed version of the game later (or send this to people who donate a special amount).</h3>
<p>It could be, but that is something that we want to decide later,<br/>because this depends on the project funding.<br/>One thing is for sure, we want to focus on doing a game and we are not intrested in making big money.</p>

<h2>Our Story so far:</h2>
<p>Since 20 years we (the team known as ""Desperate Studios"") are all friends with a passion. This passion is based up on our shared memories of the old days of computer gaming. As we grown up as kids we loved to play together, this started with the first Atari consoles that we owned.</p>
<p>As much as we loved playing, we always loved it to create games. <br/>It's not a lie if I tell you that after a half year in shool we started pogramming our first C-64 basic-games (with 6 years).</p>
<p>Every one of us got his special talent. One of us liked to program, while the others deliver a story idea, made the graphics and the music.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://stadt.heim.at/berlin/110116/GD64.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>We did so many games and programs on the early home computer systems, the C-64 and Amiga. Also some of us made music for the huge demo-scene at this time. Some of the programs, games and demos we made were released as public domain on Germany's Diskmagazine ""Game On"" and ""Magic Disk 64"".<br/>There are projects in our memories for ever, like our first graphic-text-adventure ""The Castles of Manderscheid""... based up on a fairy tale that was told kids around the ""Eifel"" in Germany about two castles. <br/>I could go on for hours now...</p>
<p>We must admit, we were part of a cracking group for some time.<br/>But this wasn't something ""illegal"" in our mind and we don't regret it.<br/>We shared the whole cracking group ""philosophy"", you know ""Try it... you like it then buy it"". So we cracked many classic games... the last one I remember was ""Ufo-Terror from the Deep"". A Great game!</p>
<p>We always did it ""for the fun"".</p>
<p>In this former time people were able to create games on the current<br/>technological state.... without investing a penny :) Nowerdays you would'nt even think to make a modern 3D game without millions of dollar in the back.</p>
<p>For a period of time we fall in love with the first MMORPG ""Ultima Online""<br/>(a milestone of in gaming history). We ran a ""free to play"" shard for a long time called ""Lemuria"". This was a funny time.</p>
<p>We are all grown up now, we got our ""normal"" every day jobs.<br/>But we never lost our hobby and passion.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://stadt.heim.at/berlin/110116/kiffer.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/>The times have changed. <br/>One game is still present: Maniac Mansion. <br/>This classic masterpiece was something that we all loved so much. <br/>One time we discovered how to edit all the text in the game, that was so funny to redo all the script.</p>
<p>We played it together and it's for ever in our mind. The reason is <br/>simple, because it started the new era of Point&amp;Click Adventure games.<br/>Many of the games that followed were amazing.<br/>We want to worship this game(s)...</p>

<p>Updates:</p>
<p>25.06.2012 - Neo has nearly finished the Homepage. Also we discussed today what to do next and we made some cuts to stuff (some of the game characters, screens, puzzles, side quests). We think this a little bit in size reduced concept is much better to realise.... We can swap anytime if necessary.</p></div>","Visit the website at http://crazy-mansion.heim.at
 

These facts are based on our currently game concept that can change a bit during development.

--->  Classic oldshool adventure game for the PC-System (Windows PC System, at least 1 Ghz, 128 MB graphic-card DirectX 9, Screenresolution 1280x720 / 1024x768, 512 MB System Ram, Soundcard or onboard soundchip, at least 2 GB Diskspace)
--->  DRM Free
--->  Language: English and German (maybe more)
--->  All ingame dialogs dubbed, also a dubbed storyteller during  the game
--->  Painted 2D graphics
--->  A game interface like ""S.C.U.M.M. (TM)""
--->  45 screens right now...
--->  ...and it's not only playing in the mansion
--->  Around 300 objects
--->  20 characters
--->  One playable main character, but at some points in the game the possibility to play other side characters
--->  For now one intro and 3 different endings of the game
--->  2 hours of composed music
 
--->  Dozens of puzzles and...
--->  ... do you remember some stuff like ""microwaving the hamster"", just to see what will happen? There are many of those things to do in the game. Also there are plenty of what we call ""Subquests"" (do something, solve puzzles) to see the outcome of your doings. This is beside the main storyline.
--->  The game will be full of dialogs witg black humor, satire, sarcasm, mocking, paradox, blasphemy....
--->  There should be around 20 hours of playing time invested to solve the game
 
 

 
 

Anybody knows the story about the mysterious incident that should have happened at the old Mansion in the forest some years ago...
A Meteorite hit near the old Mansion. The genius professor who lived there with his family went instantly insane. He was driven by this extraterrestrial, who used him for his evil plan to destroy the world.The professor even hijacked a young girl, called Sandy.This was his big mistake. A group of some courageous children who only wanted to save their friends life then saved our world.

 
 
This is the story that is still told to all children who aren't well-behaved.But... ""Thats all fucking shit!!"", thought the ten years old little kid Timmy.Today was the first working day in his young life. He really wanted to earn some money to get this new cool Playstation 3 ""Modern Warfuck"" Edition. It was hard for him to persuade his mother, that he can deliver the newspapers.
After some hard working hours and ten miles on foot there was only one New York Dimes left to deliver. But this last Magazine was addressed for the Old Mansion! Timmy still remembered the words of his mother: 'Take you job seriously, boy! If you throw only one newspaper away you'll get fired! I will ask everywhere if they got a newspaper!'.

Fearfully he went down the road to the old mansion. Just before the entrance of the building he stopped. What the hell! He was totally shocked. The door opened very slowly. He didn't know what he was seeing.
There was an evil looking green monster, looking like the tentacle that he saw in a friends computer game out of the stoneage some weeks ago. This thing began to talk! 'Hey kid, do you got something to eat for me??' 'WAHHH!' Timmy cried and ran away.
He lost his last newspaper on the way, lost his job then. His mother was frustrated cause she thought the child was using drugs, like all other boys in the neighborhood.
Only Timmy's Uncle, the self claimed ""Ghost Hunter"" Detlef Digger, believed the words of the boy. Sure he did! Detlef is a former police officer, and worked in the drug department.Unfortunately he got fired because he consumed all confiscated drugs over years.
In his life he always believed anything from aliens to the illuminati. Maybe the drugs were far too much.He was ten years without a job. Then the mid-30 though it could be a good ideato make himself independent. So nowerdays he walks from one retirement home to another to find more mad old people who believe that they need a ghost hunter. Fore sure after a lot of persuading and maybe with the help of a friend who like fasching costumes.
One night Detlef sat in his cellar office. He though how he could expand his ""customer range"". Then an old woman called Detlef and cried for help.
 
 
 
 
This Old woman told him something about kidnapping, strange acting persons, a slimy creature who has bulimia, a telefonbook where she got his number in the section and she mentioned the old Mansion.
 
Of course she also talked about ... Adolf Hitler... the rubble women after the end of world war two... her own war imprisonment and how russian soldiers died while raping her ... her twenty cat's in the last 60 years ... and more bullshit. To be gentle Detlef listened to her monolog until he heared a load scream and someone hang up the phone.
Detlef realized that there must be a connection in what Timmy told him and this... There must be something going on in the Old Mansion.!
So Detlef decided to visit the old Mansion. In the same Night he started his journey into the biggest Adventure of his Live.
 
 

There were two different opinions in our team.
One part of us think that this crowd-funding idea is great and offers the possibility for people like us to launch a huge project. Thats just the opinion of some of us.
The other opinion was, that it seems to some of us, that only some already known people (who got huge success in the entertainment business already) have a chance to realise a well funded project here.
One of us said : ""It's entirely utopistic to even think of it. All the funded projects and people behind use all possibilities, like existing contacts in the business, an already huge set-up community or a lot of money to promote a project. The people that should profit from the crowdfunding project can't profit from it.""
But we don't share the same opinion in this matter, and thats okay. We discussed this topic for a long time. In the end we decided to give it a try.
We don't want to entertain the masses with an old school adventure game. How could we ? This kind of game-genre is not suitable for the mass today.So we can't rely on external sources, like publishers that want to make money like hell and have creative control everywhere. They urge every developer to produce another ultra-realistic 3D Shooter that the mass of people want to play...

In this times, it would be financial suicide for us to borrow any (more) money from banks. Most of us also got a family to feed, a ""normal"" everday job and we were and are not able to do something of this scale alone.
So if at least one of us can quit the normal job and make this project like it should be (a year of fulltime work on it...) we need an alternative.
And there it came one day that one of us told the rest that there is this new crowdfunding website, where new projects get funded. Indiegogo with it's independent development community could be what we needed... maybe.
 

We are huge fans of creative independent games, and this is a chance to prove that there are still other people around that demand for an unique story and puzzle driven, crazy, old shool adventure game.
Our all time favourite is the game that started it all: Maniac Mansion (C) by Lucas Arts.

We want to do something ""new"" and create our very own Adventure Game
We got our ready game concept with all our special ideas, dialogs and scripts in place. It's ready since we wrote on it together mid-2004. This 300 pages concept is huge and contains much of allusions to the adventure games of the past.
We want to take the best from this classic (like the interface idea... ) and bring it up into our time, to worship the cult-game we love so much. Also we would use some things from this classic game that started an era. (those parts can easily be used without copyright violations)
We want to relaunch our crazy-mansion project (from 2005) on a big scale with the help of this crowdfunding idea.... maybe ?!
To finance a real big old school adventure project, that should reach up to our surely high expectations, we need you !Are there enough crazy people out there who want this""Crazy Mansion"" old school adventure ?
 
 
 
 
 

The team under Simon's supervision want to develop a classic point-and-click adventure game.
The development would take place in a period of one year.Our success isn't making lot's of money, but to ""sprout"" during the process of creating the game we always wanted to make. At least one of us also have really would like to quit the present job to work on the project fulltime.
Thanks to the possibilities of the internet today (with high speed data transfer), we don't have to work in one place all the time. So a rented office is not urgently required. But we need at least the money to meet up with all members at least once in a week.
Also we need to hire more full time or part time graphic artist. We want to get them paid for the work, so we could expect the results that we want to get. They are needed to get the huge amount of artwork done. Also one of us is looking forward to train a bit with them :) He can and already had scetched lot's of stuff that we got in mind.

Every amount of money for this project is great!
With more funding, we can ""walk faster and better"" towards our goal. We think that we need at least around 10.000$. That's the money to get the game done in around 1 year, like we got it in mind (e.g. pay additional pro-staff for graphic-arts and voice overs).
Less money means less capabilities. We need more time, it's much harder to get the huge artwork done, we can't get our engine licensed and so on.
But it's great to get more funding than needed,  because this only means more improvement in many ways.
A much higher funding could mean...:
--->  Maybe we could rent an office building
--->  Some of us (or maybe all) could quit their normal daily job to work fulltime
--->  We could hire more extra staff. This means a lot more animations, artwork and a lot of cutscenes as well as even more game content
--->  We could port it to Mac Platforms, iOS and Android Platforms and Linux as well
--->  A Translation into more languages is passible: French, Spanish, Italian, Russian
--->  We can get the best possible voice-over artists for all languages
--->  We could deliver the game also as a boxed version, with a Printed Game Manual and a nice poster.
--->  We could advertise for the game on a big scale, like ads in game magazines
--->  We could think about doing another game....

The times have changed. One game is still present: Maniac Mansion. This classic masterpiece was something that we all loved so much. One time we discovered how to edit all the text in the game, that was so funny to redo all the script.
We played it together and it's for ever in our mind. The reason is simple, because it started the new era of Point&Click Adventure games.Many of the games that followed were amazing.We want to worship this game(s)...

Updates:
25.06.2012 - Neo has nearly finished the Homepage. Also we discussed today what to do next and we made some cuts to stuff (some of the game characters, screens, puzzles, side quests). We think this a little bit in size reduced concept is much better to realise.... We can swap anytime if necessary.",31.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hello there!</p>
<p>I’m James and I am both an avid gamer and a long-time reader of superhero comics. I’ve spent years thinking to myself that a story driven RPG set in a world of superheroes would be really fun. So far, I still haven’t found what I’m looking for (I guess Bono was on to something...). Sure there have been a few online RPG’s (City of Heroes, Champions Online, DC Universe Online), and these games were a lot of fun, but what I want is a single-player game that tells me a story, not just supplying a story as a background to blowing things/people up.</p>
<p>And, so, I thought, if the game isn’t going to be made for me, then why don’t I make that game myself? I’ve been writing fiction for years and writing for games has always been something that’s attracted me. I’ve played around with pixel-art for a long time and I studied Computer Science in college. It’s time to put it all together and so here we are!</p>

<p><strong>So what is Knights, exactly?</strong></p>
<p>Well, if you can contain all that excitement for just one more second, then I’ll tell you! Knights is a PC game about superheroes (hopefully you’ve worked that much out by now) centring around a young hero, MidKnight, discovering his true potential and the journey that will (with your help) take him there. In this world academies exist to train heroes to be the best they can, and as our story begins our hero is just setting out to undertake his final exams. But as his exams come to a close, tragedy strikes the school and he must set out on an adventure to unite a group of heroes, former students of the academy, in order to fight an enemy whose power the world has never seen before.</p>
<p>There will of course be parodies of the heroes we all know and love along with some more original heroes thrown in too. (Check the ‘You’re a Hero’ perk for more details about how you can slide your way in here.) Most importantly, this game will have a sense of fun. No eighties-comic style dark brooding here!</p>

<p>Hey, look it's the main hero, MidKnight!</p>
<p><strong>Why am I here on Indiegogo? </strong></p>
<p>Well, I’ve spent most of my time so far working on the story for this game and now I really want to get going on the main part of the game itself. I want to be able to dedicate as much time as I can to making this game, and I want it to come out at a reasonable point in the future. I’ll be making all the graphics, writing story, writing and recording music, and everything else that goes into making a computer game these days. All this obviously takes time, and ideally I’d also like to eat food and have some kind of shelter while I’m doing this and so here I am! This is to raise in order to let me complete the game, but should the project reach past its intended goal, I will ideally be able to bring in some other people to work on some aspects of the game such as music and graphics in order to get even more quickly towards reaching a finished project.</p>

<h3>About the game</h3>
<p>Feed the Twins is a challenging and entertaining casual mobile game where the Twins, a smart hedgehog and his funny brother, need your help to collect candies in their basket in order to keep them happy and satiated.</p>
<p>You can help them with candy combos or drawing candy lines on the screen with your fingers to ""guide"" the falling candies into their basket.</p>
<p>The first version will support both iOS and Android but in future the game could support other platforms as well.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.fasteque.com/public/04.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The adventures of the Twins will be placed in different Worlds and Themes, with specific enemies, features and objectives to accomplish.</p>
<p>If you are able to complete a level and collect coins during a game session, you will be rewarded with special points to be used in the game Store to unlock new Worlds and Themes.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Game features</h3>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Worlds</strong></p>
<p>The adventures of the hedgehogs will be set in different worlds. The first version of the game will feature Earth and Space worlds, with Ocean already in the pipeline for the first update.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Themes</strong></p>
<p>Each world will be divided into different themes: so far we planned 3 themes for the Earth world, country, picnic, snow, and two in Space, Moon and Mars.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.fasteque.com/public/03.png"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Levels</strong></p>
<p>For each theme, you will have to unlock a specific number of levels: help the Twins in their path to get all the candies!</p>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.fasteque.com/public/07.png"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Combos</strong></p>
<p><span>You can match two candies of the same type to get more points. Be careful: in each set there is the preferred candy of Twins but also the most hated!</span></p>
<p><span><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.fasteque.com/public/full-4.png"" src="""" style=""""/></span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Enemies</strong></p>
<p>Of course, life will not be so simple for the hedgehogs because in every world there will be an enemy ready to steal the falling candies.</p>
<p>So far, we have designed the enemy for the Earth world... a smart <strong>magpie</strong>!</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.fasteque.com/public/full-5.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Superpowers</strong></p>
<p>You will have the possibility to use special features during a game session in order to get more points or more candies or simply to have more chances to complete a level.</p>
<p><strong><em>Sugar Shot</em></strong> - y<span>ou are running out of sugar? Twins look tired and sweaty? Get an instant boost of +25% of sugar!</span></p>
<p><span><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.fasteque.com/public/full-1.png"" src="""" style=""""/></span></p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Super Force</em></strong> - the Twins can stop the cart for 10 seconds, so it will be easier for you to feed them!</p>
<p><strong><em>Candy Magnets</em></strong> - The Twins can attract all the falling candies into their basket for 10 seconds using their Candy Magnet.</p>
<p><span><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.fasteque.com/public/full-2.png"" src="""" style=""""/></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Coins</strong></p>
<p>Get the coins with the candies and you will have more points to be spent in the Game Store.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.fasteque.com/public/full-6.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>About the project</h3>
<p>We currently have a demo for both iOS and Android for the first world and it is a good benchmark to understand what we still need to do to complete the game.</p>
<p>The first round of graphic has been completed, and three themes for the first world are ready! However, we need to complete another world, create character animations and all the set of candies you will play with.</p>
<p>Polishing is never enough nowadays, so extra work is required to fully complete the game and to make it ready for the market (and do not forget test activities of course).</p>
<p>We also need to produce new sound effects and background music for each world: we think what we have now is of great quality, so it's necessary to maintain this standard.</p>
<p>Anything beyond the technical aspects of the game will boost our marketing campaign to help us reach the widest audience possible.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Where the money will be used</h3>
<p>We would like to be very open about where the money will be invested, taking into account to reach our goal of $15000. In case we will be so lucky thank to you to reach even a better result, we will be more than happy to update this section.</p>
<p><strong>Development</strong> - $5500</p>
<p>This the core essence of the game and it will be done using a cross-platform engine.</p>
<p><strong>Graphics and Animations</strong> - $3500</p>
<p>We really think the look &amp; feel of the UI is really great, so we need to keep this high standard. Each world will have a specific style and various different themes. Also, we have to work on hedgehogs and their enemies animations.</p>
<p><strong>Musics and Sounds</strong> - $1500</p>
<p>We already have produced the main theme and the background music for the Earth world. We need to complete the set of sound effects and produce a music for all the other worlds of the game.</p>
<p><strong>Testing</strong> - $1000</p>
<p>As you may know, tests are never enough, specially for cross-platform games, considering also all the different devices supported by Android.</p>
<p><strong>PR &amp; Marketing activities</strong> - $3500</p>
<p>We need to produce banners, press releases, submit game for reviews, ... all the basic supporting activities required today for mobile games.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>We're two professional application and game developers for mobile devices in the gambling and casino industry.</p>
<p>We have so much passion for casual and social gaming that we spend most of our spare time working on side projects: Feed the Twins is our last creation and it will keep us busy for next weeks!</p>
<p>Before this project, we released another game, a simple but addictive puzzle game called Logix, available for <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/logix/id561455014?mt=8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">iOS</a> and <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fasteque.logix"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Android</a>.

</div></div>","About the game
Feed the Twins is a challenging and entertaining casual mobile game where the Twins, a smart hedgehog and his funny brother, need your help to collect candies in their basket in order to keep them happy and satiated.
You can help them with candy combos or drawing candy lines on the screen with your fingers to ""guide"" the falling candies into their basket.
The first version will support both iOS and Android but in future the game could support other platforms as well.
 

 
The adventures of the Twins will be placed in different Worlds and Themes, with specific enemies, features and objectives to accomplish.
If you are able to complete a level and collect coins during a game session, you will be rewarded with special points to be used in the game Store to unlock new Worlds and Themes.


 
Game features
 
Worlds
The adventures of the hedgehogs will be set in different worlds. The first version of the game will feature Earth and Space worlds, with Ocean already in the pipeline for the first update.
 
Themes
Each world will be divided into different themes: so far we planned 3 themes for the Earth world, country, picnic, snow, and two in Space, Moon and Mars. 

 
Levels
For each theme, you will have to unlock a specific number of levels: help the Twins in their path to get all the candies!

 
Combos
You can match two candies of the same type to get more points. Be careful: in each set there is the preferred candy of Twins but also the most hated!

 
Enemies
Of course, life will not be so simple for the hedgehogs because in every world there will be an enemy ready to steal the falling candies.
So far, we have designed the enemy for the Earth world... a smart magpie!

 
Superpowers
You will have the possibility to use special features during a game session in order to get more points or more candies or simply to have more chances to complete a level.
Sugar Shot - you are running out of sugar? Twins look tired and sweaty? Get an instant boost of +25% of sugar!

 
Super Force - the Twins can stop the cart for 10 seconds, so it will be easier for you to feed them!
Candy Magnets - The Twins can attract all the falling candies into their basket for 10 seconds using their Candy Magnet.

 
Coins
Get the coins with the candies and you will have more points to be spent in the Game Store.

 
 
About the project
We currently have a demo for both iOS and Android for the first world and it is a good benchmark to understand what we still need to do to complete the game.
The first round of graphic has been completed, and three themes for the first world are ready! However, we need to complete another world, create character animations and all the set of candies you will play with.
Polishing is never enough nowadays, so extra work is required to fully complete the game and to make it ready for the market (and do not forget test activities of course).
We also need to produce new sound effects and background music for each world: we think what we have now is of great quality, so it's necessary to maintain this standard.
Anything beyond the technical aspects of the game will boost our marketing campaign to help us reach the widest audience possible.


 
Where the money will be used
We would like to be very open about where the money will be invested, taking into account to reach our goal of $15000. In case we will be so lucky thank to you to reach even a better result, we will be more than happy to update this section.
Development - $5500
This the core essence of the game and it will be done using a cross-platform engine.
Graphics and Animations - $3500
We really think the look & feel of the UI is really great, so we need to keep this high standard. Each world will have a specific style and various different themes. Also, we have to work on hedgehogs and their enemies animations.
Musics and Sounds - $1500
We already have produced the main theme and the background music for the Earth world. We need to complete the set of sound effects and produce a music for all the other worlds of the game.
Testing - $1000
As you may know, tests are never enough, specially for cross-platform games, considering also all the different devices supported by Android.
PR & Marketing activities - $3500
We need to produce banners, press releases, submit game for reviews, ... all the basic supporting activities required today for mobile games.


 
Who we are
We're two professional application and game developers for mobile devices in the gambling and casino industry.
We have so much passion for casual and social gaming that we spend most of our spare time working on side projects: Feed the Twins is our last creation and it will keep us busy for next weeks!
Before this project, we released another game, a simple but addictive puzzle game called Logix, available for iOS and Android. A video review can be found here.
 
We are always more than happy to get feedback from people, so if you would like you can reach us whenever you want.

<p>Running a campaign as Game Master can be very time consuming, more so than we (GMs/DMS) often care to admit. For the campaign to be run successfully, the Narrator will have to create an engaging world with interesting non-player characters that speaks to the player’s imagination. Such a world takes a lot of time to create and it often happens that the players take decisions that have them bypass a lot of carefully planned out content. After having spent all the time making it, this can be quite frustrating for the narrator.</p>
<p>In such a situation Game Masters will often try to improvise new content just to make sure the campaign keeps going, to do this properly however requires a great amount of creativity and experience. This improvised new story often isn’t up to par with the rest of the campaign and can sometimes even mean the end of one. After a while every player will get bored of the haughty elf mage, the orphan boy that becomes king or evil dystopian megacorporation stereotypes. <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.freelanced.com/share/freelancers/53693/152965.jpg?v=1"" id=""Ryan Gutierrez "" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Ryan Gutierrez ""/></p>
<p>A couple years ago a bunch of experienced narrators sat down together at a roleplaying convention in the uk and openly discussed situations that had caused issues in their own games. That discussion was the beginning of this book Project.</p>
<p>Everything contained within this publication has been written to be as system neutral as possible, to ensure it can be used easily in your adventures, wherever they may take you.</p>
<p><br/>In this book you will find full descriptions of interesting, ready to use characters. All of them are unique with their own quirks and traits. They can be used as quest-giving non-player characters, villains to be hunted down or even as a starting point for players that get stuck while making their own character.</p>
<p>This book also contains a fully working fantasy town setting, ready to use in any fantasy campaign that needs it. We have included a map of the town and it offers multiple non-player characters, quest hooks and adventure ideas for you to use</p>
<p>The Publication will be approximately 100 pages with full colour front and back cover, probably 8.5"" x 11"" (US Letter) like most RPG books around.</p>
<p><strong>Artwork</strong></p>
<p>We are very lucky to have three great illustrators working with us on his project they are</p>

<p><br/><strong>Where are we now?</strong><br/> Up to this point, the project has been entirely self-funded, but unfortunately, we have run out of money. So what we are hoping for is to raise $2700 to be able to finish the book.</p>
<p>We will be using the funds to get some artwork for the cover and additional pieces inside the publication. In addition to this the extra funds will allow to us to get the first full print run complete including all the other costs that go into producing a publication like this.</p>

<p> </p></div>","What’s it all about
Running a campaign as Game Master can be very time consuming, more so than we (GMs/DMS) often care to admit. For the campaign to be run successfully, the Narrator will have to create an engaging world with interesting non-player characters that speaks to the player’s imagination. Such a world takes a lot of time to create and it often happens that the players take decisions that have them bypass a lot of carefully planned out content. After having spent all the time making it, this can be quite frustrating for the narrator.
In such a situation Game Masters will often try to improvise new content just to make sure the campaign keeps going, to do this properly however requires a great amount of creativity and experience. This improvised new story often isn’t up to par with the rest of the campaign and can sometimes even mean the end of one. After a while every player will get bored of the haughty elf mage, the orphan boy that becomes king or evil dystopian megacorporation stereotypes. 
A couple years ago a bunch of experienced narrators sat down together at a roleplaying convention in the uk and openly discussed situations that had caused issues in their own games. That discussion was the beginning of this book Project.
Everything contained within this publication has been written to be as system neutral as possible, to ensure it can be used easily in your adventures, wherever they may take you.
In this book you will find full descriptions of interesting, ready to use characters. All of them are unique with their own quirks and traits. They can be used as quest-giving non-player characters, villains to be hunted down or even as a starting point for players that get stuck while making their own character.
This book also contains a fully working fantasy town setting, ready to use in any fantasy campaign that needs it. We have included a map of the town and it offers multiple non-player characters, quest hooks and adventure ideas for you to use
The Publication will be approximately 100 pages with full colour front and back cover, probably 8.5"" x 11"" (US Letter) like most RPG books around.
Artwork
We are very lucky to have three great illustrators working with us on his project they are
Jonny Gray ( http://jonnygray.mcalister.org.uk/ )
Mark Ford (http://www.imagekind.com/MemberProfile.aspx?MID=d4b82bfd-39be-497a-9d88-1dd53b442878)
Ryan Gutierrez (http://www.freelanced.com/ryangutierrez)
Please click the links above to see samples of their work.
Where are we now? Up to this point, the project has been entirely self-funded, but unfortunately, we have run out of money. So what we are hoping for is to raise $2700 to be able to finish the book.
We will be using the funds to get some artwork for the cover and additional pieces inside the publication. In addition to this the extra funds will allow to us to get the first full print run complete including all the other costs that go into producing a publication like this.
What's in it for you? Every donation will earn you a mention in the book as a funding contributor, but there is more.
 


A $8 donation will get you a PDF version of the finished book, delivered to your inbox before the official launch in Jan 2013.

 

A $20 donation will get you a Hardcopy version of the finished book, delivered to your home address before the official launch in Jan 2013
 


A $25 donation will get you a Hardcopy version of the finished book, Plus a full PDF delivered to you before the official launch in 2013

 


If you donate $100 to this project then you ""the donator"" get to have your own character published in this book – either something you personally have designed or written or something that is born out of a collaboration with one of the book authors. As a bonus one of our artists will create an illustration based upon your character for inclusion in the final book.

 So in short: what we are looking for is to produce a fun and helpful book for all role playing gamers, we just need a little help from you to be able to finish it completely. If you help us, you will get our eternal gratitude as well as the rewards mentioned above.
Finally 50% of the net profit generated from the sale of this publication is going to be donated to the following UK based charities: - Marfan Association UK, The National Autistic Society and the RSPCA.

The Ambassadors will travel all summer playing baseball, conducting free baseball clinics, and working with churches all around Oklahoma, Nebraska, Texas, Kansas, and Nicaragua.</p><p><br/></p><p>A Life Worth Following (ALWF) is an organization formed in memory of an extraordinary young Christian baseball player named Justin Sullivan who died tragically in a car accident. Justin had an incredibly close walk with God and his story has inspired thousands for follow Christ. A Life Worth Following exists to reach the unreached in the baseball community with the life-giving message of Jesus Christ, and to build and equip baseball players through discipleship. Showing God's love, we strive to reach a hungry world with Jesus through obedience to the Great Commission.</p><p><br/></p><p>We are a responsible and respected 501(c)(3) organization with a history of impacting the communities we travel to.

<p>ALWF also could not identify any organizations that were currently reaching out to the baseball community.  We reached out to Lee Tunnell, who is a former Major League pitcher, and current Bullpen Coach for the Milwaukee Brewers and whose son had played on travel teams growing up and in high school.  We decided the best way to tackle this issue was to form our own travel baseball team whose purpose was to train and equip baseball players for outreach in the baseball community.</p>
<p>With the increase in importance that baseball players are placing on playing on these elite travel teams, we see the need for outreach growing.  Players feel that they cannot attain a college baseball scholarship unless they are willing to sacrifice the majority of their time to play year round and be seen by as many college and professional scouts as possible.  Currently we are only able to reach out to areas of Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, and Texas.  This means that the majority of the baseball community across the United States is going unreached.</p>
<p><b>The Solution</b></p>
<p>The goals of this project are to sustain and expand our reach among those in the baseball community sharing the message of Christ, building and equipping baseball players through discipleship, and living out the Great Commission.</p>
<p>We are targeting two separate audiences.  The first is the building up and equipping of the Ambassador baseball players. Currently we have 18-26 baseball players per summer.  Our prayer is that all of our players will be equipped to live a missional life for Christ based on their experience with the Ambassadors.  The majority of our players will go on to play college baseball (some professionally) where we hope that they can be ambassadors for Christ on their college or professional teams.  Some of our players will go on to do other things, but regardless will be equipped to be an ambassador for Christ in whatever they do.  Our second target audience is the lost of the baseball community. Conservatively between our clinics, games, baseball mission trip, and journals we reach at least 5,000 people over the course of a summer.  Those we encounter will directly benefit from the programs that ALWF offers, first and foremost because they will hear the good news of Christ on a baseball field.  Whether they are a child who attends one of our clinics, or a baseball player on another team who has just played the Ambassadors, or a parent in the stands, all will hear the gospel of Christ.  In six years that our organization has done this, we have only had two teams decline to listen to our message.  That’s two out of over 300 teams that we have played. It is incredible how playing baseball has opened a door to share the gospel.  You would be hard pressed to find those kind of results on the international mission field, or at a local church from the most well trained preachers.  For whatever reason, the baseball community is ready, eager, and yearning for the gospel.</p><p></p><h3><font color=""#222222""><span style=""font-size: 15px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 21px;"">PLEASE CONSIDER SUPPORTING THIS IMPORTANT PROJECT</span></font></h3><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>If you cannot donate right now, please help by posting links to this campaign and  A Life Worth Following in as many places as possible!  This would be a great help to our organization.</p><p><a href=""http://igg.me/at/OKCAmbassadors/x/6138721"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://igg.me/at/OKCAmbassadors/x/6138721</a></p><p></p><p><a href=""http://www.alifeworthfollowing.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.alifeworthfollowing.org</a></p><p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/33821736376/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/groups/33821736376/</a><br/></p><p><a href=""https://twitter.com/ALWFAmbassadors"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://twitter.com/ALWFAmbassadors</a><br/></p><p><br/></p></div>","About A Life Worth Following and the OKC AmbassadorsThe OKC Ambassadors is a summer baseball team characterized by: college ability high school junior and senior players who want to learn how to share their faith, give back to the game by conducting free baseball clinics for kids, grow spiritually by studying the Bible, become accountable to other Christian believers, and experience the joy of service by going on an international baseball mission trip.  The Ambassadors are 100% about baseball, and 100% about ministry.

<p></p><p></p></div>","ReignMaker (formerly known as: Tower of Elements 2) is brought to you by Frogdice: an indie game studio based in Lexington, Kentucky. Founded in 1996, Frogdice makes online RPGs and downloadable games that take place in the high fantasy world of Primordiax.This is our second crowdfunded game. Our first delivered on time and players loved it!ReignMaker (formerly known as: Tower of Elements 2) is a real time strategy and puzzle game with deep city building and match-3/tower defense combat. From your capital city you lead your Kingdom against the invading Void Army that threatens all life.Your strategy, tower defense, and match-3 skills will determine the fate of your armies, but the many political decisions you make as a leader affect the story and the culture of your kingdom.As your capital city improves, you will have access to more powerful spells, mightier elite troops, and better battlefield gear and armaments.Along the way you will also earn achievements, complete quests, and fill your Bestiary with enemies.The capital city of your Kingdom is vitally important. This is where resources are gathered, spells are researched, troops are recruited, battlefield gear is constructed, and much more.You will build your capital city on one of three continents: Mitralon, Ta'Raekhet, or Katayvan. Each continent has its own strengths and advantages.There are 8 major building types that you will construct and upgrade. You will also want to grow your population, recruit and train workers, manage resources, and make Kingdom policy decisions that affect both the story and the culture of your Kingdom. All of these decisions will have profound effects on the battlefield.Combat is handled through a combination of match 3 and tower defense.Each tower has a grid of elemental runes. When you match at least 3 of these runes in a horizontal or vertical line, they detonate and send elemental bolts onto the battlefield. Any enemy struck by an elemental bolt will take damage.The battlefield itself is managed in a tower defense manner. Troops, barriers, walls, explosives, and all manner of other options are at your disposal.During battle, random quests will occasionally be given to you. You can complete these quests for bonus rewards You will face 10 bosses with unique and challenging mechanics. Combine your skill at match-3 and tower defense to succeed against the Void Army.There are 10 regions on the world map with 50 towers at strategic battle locations. Each region has a different type of terrain, and each tower has a different configuration. The rune boards vary significantly in shape, number, and presence of special rune types (locked, frozen, blocked, corrupted, etc.). There is an enormous amount of variety in the match-3 part of the game.Throughout the game you will make tough decisions as leader. Events will occur where you have to choose the policy your kingdom will follow. These decisions are critical to the story and will also determine the culture of your kingdom. There are four culture traits: Martial,Druidic, Republic, and Elemental. Your decisions will determine the degree to which your Kingdom's culture exhibits some or all of those traits. The result will have both cosmetic and real gameplay effects.There are 10 bosses throughout the game that present distinct challenges and gameplay mechanics. These tend to be some of the most intense and challenging battles in the game. A few of these bosses (or their relatives) are making a return from Tower of Elements 1 or Dungeon of Elements.

<p>You will be the pilot of the MQ-71 UAV plane, a fictional futuristic Unmanned Air Vehicle.</p>
<p>Your role is to defend democracy and freedom, killing your enemies in a world-war scenario.<br/></p></span><p></p>
<p>This plane is equipped with the most advanced lethal weapons, to ensure the total destruction of the enemy, and the full enjoyment of the player.</p>

<p><br/>The game is composed of about 30/40 levels, the player will be immersed in lot of different environments, from the desert to the jungle, from the mountains to the sea.</p>
<p>Some missions will be played in full color mode, while others will use the infrared camera, depending on visibility conditions.<br/><br/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Developement needs</strong></h3>
<p>You coul be wondering why do we need so much money to develop a game like this.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/medias/965500/pictures/full/20130802203255-Untitled-1.png?1375500777"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/>There are lot of elements that makes it so expensive, take a look:<br/><br/></p>
<ul>
<li>The game is entirely developed using 3D graphics</li>
<li>We want a state-of-the-art game, so we will be using the latest technologies available on the market to provide the best gaming experience possible</li>
<li>The game will be cross-platform.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/medias/966349/pictures/full/20130803095123-img2.png?1375548918"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/>Ok that seem so simple but take in mind that:<br/><br/></p>
<ul>
<li>An advanced game engine license costs about 1500 USD per device, plus another 1500 USD for the game engine itself</li>
<li>The team will be composed of experienced 3D artists, programmers, UI and UX experts, project managers and other professional figures. They will not work for free... unfortunately!</li>
<li>Our targets are mobile platforms so the game must be optimized to run smoothly on low end devices</li>
<li>We need the logo and promotional images</li>
<li>Publishing the game on several platforms is a complicated task, and without going in too deep it is a very costly operation</li>
<li>We obviously need to let people know this game exists, and this is called marketing. Just think that a TV commercial can cost thousands dollars per second! You will not see SkyWars ad on your television but it's just an example to let you better understand how expensive this can be</li>
</ul>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>
<br/><strong>Multiplatform</strong>
</h3>
<p>Yes! This will be a multiplatform game!<br/><br/>At the moment we are targeting the most used mobile platform:</p>
<ul>
<li>iOS</li>
<li>Android</li>
<li>Blackberry</li>
<li>Windows Mobile</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/medias/966411/pictures/full/20130803103139-dev.png?1375551102"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Funding goals</strong></h3>
<p>Reaching the founding goal is very importat to us to deliver a quality game.</p>
<p>If we will not reach the goal the game will be downsized, proportionally to the found we raised. It will also be relased just for Android and iOS with less missions and details.</p>

You will be the pilot of the MQ-71 UAV plane, a fictional futuristic Unmanned Air Vehicle.
Your role is to defend democracy and freedom, killing your enemies in a world-war scenario.
This plane is equipped with the most advanced lethal weapons, to ensure the total destruction of the enemy, and the full enjoyment of the player.

Machinegun
AGM144
105mm


Weapons will be unlocked during the game, and they can be powered up using collected coins.

The game is composed of about 30/40 levels, the player will be immersed in lot of different environments, from the desert to the jungle, from the mountains to the sea.
Some missions will be played in full color mode, while others will use the infrared camera, depending on visibility conditions.
 
Developement needs
You coul be wondering why do we need so much money to develop a game like this.

There are lot of elements that makes it so expensive, take a look:

The game is entirely developed using 3D graphics
We want a state-of-the-art game, so we will be using the latest technologies available on the market to provide the best gaming experience possible
The game will be cross-platform.


Ok that seem so simple but take in mind that:

An advanced game engine license costs about 1500 USD per device, plus another 1500 USD for the game engine itself
The team will be composed of experienced 3D artists, programmers, UI and UX experts, project managers and other professional figures. They will not work for free... unfortunately!
Our targets are mobile platforms so the game must be optimized to run smoothly on low end devices
We need the logo and promotional images
Publishing the game on several platforms is a complicated task, and without going in too deep it is a very costly operation
We obviously need to let people know this game exists, and this is called marketing. Just think that a TV commercial can cost thousands dollars per second! You will not see SkyWars ad on your television but it's just an example to let you better understand how expensive this can be




 

Multiplatform

Yes! This will be a multiplatform game!At the moment we are targeting the most used mobile platform:

iOS
Android
Blackberry
Windows Mobile

 
 
Funding goals
Reaching the founding goal is very importat to us to deliver a quality game.
If we will not reach the goal the game will be downsized, proportionally to the found we raised. It will also be relased just for Android and iOS with less missions and details.
In the case the founding will exceed our goal, we should be able to distribute the game in a PC version for Windows, Linux and Mac, and also as a Facebook application, in an higher quality than the mobile one.
 
That's all folks! Back us and enjoy the game!",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

  Rascal Rider is an arcade racing game. Fast, simple and fun. And it's as good as simple it sounds. The simplicty of the basic gameplay mechanics allows us to fine tune the controls for many devices without loosing on gameplay quality. There is a reason why there aren't many cross-platform games on the market, but what we want to prove with Rascal Rider is that by choosing the right genre and the right mechanics, cross-platform multiplayer is a great opportunity. Just think of multiplayer PC gaming, the variety of input devices it mixes together, the variety of screen sizes and graphical capabilities of the used hardware. And now think of the cross-platform multiplayer again, and it doesn't sound so strange any more...</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/245279/files/20131206020629-logos_new.png?1386324389"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">It does require extra effort to do it right. If you don't plan and design for a cross-platform gameplay from the very beginning, you may not be able to do it at all in the end. But we were aware of that, and we did plan and design Rascal Rider just for that. We have made that extra effort to make Rascal Rider a proper cross-platform game, because:</span><br/></p>
<ul>

As the multiplayer part of Rascal Rider is very important to us, we belive that the free-to-play model will work well for the game nad it's players. Sure there's a lot of things you can do wrong with a free-to-play game, but titles like League of Legends or Team Fortress 2 have shown that if done right, free-to-play is nothing to be afraid of.</span><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p>To make things as clear as possible we are going to break it into 4 basic points:</p><p></p><ol>
<li><b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">you can basically play Rascal Rider for free, all the tracks and options will be always available for you to explore,</span><br/></b></li>
<li><b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">the items that will be available for purchase with real life money, including the exclusive ones, will never give you an advantage,</span><br/></b></li>
<li><b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">if you like the game you can always get the full content for the reasonable flat price, that will be $20 for all of the initial content, which basically equals buying the full game, </span><br/></b></li>

</li>
</ol><p></p><p>Some of you may ask about the DRM-free model. As the cross-platform multiplayer will be a very important part of the Rascal Rider experience it's hard for us to release it as DRM-free. We need to provide you with the account service to let you log in into the game, and we want to give you access to the same account from many platforms. But opposite to many free-to-play titles we are not going to restrict sharing or selling your account. The licence you get with your purchases will entitle you to fully manage this license just like you could do it with a physical disc.</p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/238794/files/20131203025800-CAMELEON-LABS.png?1386068280"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em;""/><br/></p><p></p><p>cameleon-labs

The initial release of the game will provide:
20 different motorcycles in many racing liveries

We have the basics of the physics model, foundations of the combat mechanics and we have already tested the cross-platform multiplayer features.Everything we did for the past year, from the first concept arts to AI prototyping, was done to make sure that Rascal Rider can look and play exactly like we want it to. There is still a lot of work ahead of us, but at this stage we are ready to share all of the ideas with you and to make some serious commitments.What we are also ready for is to get you invloved in the development process. We have a strong vision of the Rascal Rider game, but that does not mean that we are the only guys in the world with good ideas.Games are made for players, and their voice should be heard as soon as the development process allows it. And in our case, this moment is now.Everyone who decides to pre-order the full game during this campaing will get access to the closed developmnet forums where we will all share the ideas and argue over them :)Sharing ideas is one thing, but we also need your help in the testing process. We want to test Rascal Rider on as many devices as posssible, which is really important to us regarding the cross-platform multiplayer features. And running this tests will be a privilege of you, our supporting community.But that is not all that we got prepared for you...For those of you who are willing to show some more faith in us we have prepared some exclusive Rascal Rider collectibles. From hand signed postcards to huge limited edition posters, you can equip yourself with some unique stuff, that will not be available for purchase otherwise. Alongside these rare items you can also get the original soundtrack from the game, teased here with the Rascal Rider Main Theme:Please have a good look at the perks on the right. There is a pretty good chance that you will find something just perfect for yourself. From securing your place in the game credits to becoming the legend. The choice is yours.We are going to release the Rascal Rider in a sales model that is going to be something we could call ""an indie free-to-play model"". We are gamers as well, and we do also play some free-to-play games. As the multiplayer part of Rascal Rider is very important to us, we belive that the free-to-play model will work well for the game nad it's players. Sure there's a lot of things you can do wrong with a free-to-play game, but titles like League of Legends or Team Fortress 2 have shown that if done right, free-to-play is nothing to be afraid of.To make things as clear as possible we are going to break it into 4 basic points:
you can basically play Rascal Rider for free, all the tracks and options will be always available for you to explore,
the items that will be available for purchase with real life money, including the exclusive ones, will never give you an advantage,
if you like the game you can always get the full content for the reasonable flat price, that will be $20 for all of the initial content, which basically equals buying the full game, 

any purchase you make will be valid for every platform you will log in from.

Some of you may ask about the DRM-free model. As the cross-platform multiplayer will be a very important part of the Rascal Rider experience it's hard for us to release it as DRM-free. We need to provide you with the account service to let you log in into the game, and we want to give you access to the same account from many platforms. But opposite to many free-to-play titles we are not going to restrict sharing or selling your account. The licence you get with your purchases will entitle you to fully manage this license just like you could do it with a physical disc.cameleon-labs
is an independent game developer, based in Poznan, Poland. We
are a small studio that is free to follow its own ideas, and untied
with any publisher we are ready to hear from the community in order
to make our games richer and more fun to play. Rascal Rider is out first serious game project as a team in the current shape. 
Working
on different stuff ranging from web aplications and database
solutions for corporate clients to graphic tools and big scale game
modding is how our team members got their experience (Object
Painter video1, video2; S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
Lost Alpha).
And now we are going to put all of it together, combined with our
creativty and passion, into making some kick-ass games for you, starting with the Rascal Rider.Just like we said before, we belive that crowdfunding was invented for people who are ready to follow their passions and are working to put their ideas into live. If we were working for the big studios we wouldn't really need to be here. But we are a new indie studio, formed by people crazy enough to belive that you may actually like what we are doing, and you may want to get involved as well.You can easily find us and the Rascal Rider project on the internet by simply following one of the links below:

The guys directly responsible for the Rascal Rider pre-alpha and this campaing are:Adam Dera - game designer and project leader, and a 3D artist, and...Dawid Niemiec - programmer, from AI to making sure that all of the pieces in the game world are in the right places, with all the right properties and scripts attachedJakub Jatczak - programmer, the one you will love or hate, depending on the way your bike will handle that last turnPawel Pohland - programmer, one of the ""S.T.A.L.K.E.R. The Lost Alpha"" team members, the one making sure that Rascal Rider will work as a piece of software in the endPiotr Majkutewicz - 2D&3D artist, the man mainly responsible for the art style of the Rascal RiderandSoberDrunk - the musician, the composer and the sound engineer, our all-in-one audio solution.
There are also some other young and talented people that have been doing some artwork or coding during the pre-production stage, sharing their ideas and testing different solutions. And we would really like to work with some of them again.

So far we have been working on the Rascal Rider as a passion project. As fun at it can be, it becomes a bit hard to run such a serious game project without being able to focus on it completly. The funds we are rising right here will allow us to cover the expenses like:

Unity Pro game engine licenses for the team


a reasonable salary for the core team members 


office bills


assets costs, like audio recording sessions and high quality texturing assets

a little bit of extra hardware that will make our work even more effective
What we are not going to spend money on are software licenses, as we are deep into using open source software, like Blender and GIMP, during the Rascal Rider development. Once we get a little bit closer to our initial goal, we will share our strech goals with you. These will require some further investments or simply more development time, but first we need to get this campaign up running...",15.0,4,"1 Campaign

<h3>from Micah..</h3>
<p>Dear Friends and Family, I have an exciting opportunity to serve the Lord on a Mission trip from October 8th to October 19th in Vietnam. I will be traveling with a group of eight others under the headship of Australia Christian Churches (ACC) International, where we will be working with the missionaries stationed there. Some of the projects that we hope to be working on are upgrading the kitchen, planting a garden, helping the school teach the kids English, and the ‘Shine’ program which helps girls with self esteem.</p>
<p>For more information on the organization please check out there website: <a href=""http://www.acc.org.au/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">www.acc.org.au</a>.</p>
<p>Vietnam is located in Asia, south of China and east of Thailand. Currently there are 54 ethnic groups that populate Vietnam. Over 70% of the population are Buddhist or strongly influenced by its practices. Vietnam has a population of 85.5 million people.</p>
<p>Why do I want to go to Vietnam? What better way to show God’s love than to volunteer to work in His name. I believe this will be a great life changing experience for me.  I want to help these people some how, and the only way I know is to show them the love of Christ Jesus by working along side them.  </p>
<p>Would you please consider two things? First, and most important, will you pray for me and the team? Pray for safety, protection, for good health, for Gods will to be fulfilled and for funding for this trip. Second, will you consider a donation to assist with the expense of my trip? The total cost is approximately $2,500. This covers the cost of airfare, shots, meals, land transportation, and a place to sleep for two weeks. If you choose to help financially.</p>
<p>Thank you so very much for your prayers and/or donations. I an excited about this opportunity to show God’s love in a practical way to the people of Vietnam.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<div>Mylor is a new RPG game being developed by a group of 3 people, they include:</div>
<div><ul>
<li>Flabaliki - Project leader and developer (<a href=""http://youtube.com/flabaliki"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Flabaliki"">http://youtube.com/Flabaliki</a>)</li>
<li>Edfake - Original music composer and developer (<a href=""http://youtube.com/Edfake"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Edfake"">http://youtube.com/Edfake</a>)</li>

</ul></div>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This project is actually a school project I'm creating for my final year of school. I have the next 6 months to finish off what I can for submission and marking. I've asked Edfake and TheGeeNee to aid in the project in a non-coding way to improve the look and playability of the game.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This doesn't mean the game will be finished in 6 months time, I plan to develop this afterwards as well to make it a much more enjoyable and very cheap to play game for those who can not afford more expensive titles such as the Elder Scrolls series.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>As previously mentioned, the whole goal is basically to create an action RPG game that is cheap, fun and exciting to play.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>As time moves in, we'll keep adding features in so the game doesn't get old.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>If we can't get your help, this project will not live up to our expectations and will most likely fall flat on it's face.</div>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<div>Long story short, we would like to purchase Unity Pro, a $1500 investment. Read on if you want more info.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Mylor is being developed within the Unity game engine, where the money will be going is to purchase a professional edition of the software. This will give us way more control over the game, and allow use to increase the realism and immersion to much greater heights. You can find out more info on Unity here, including pricing and what is in the pro version: <a href=""http://unity3d.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Unity3D"">http://unity3d.com</a>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Essentially what we will get from the professional version of the software that will really benefit this project is as follows:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Realistic audio filters</li>
<li>Video playback in game (including cut scenes)</li>
<li>Custom splash screen</li>
<li>The ability to use light mapping for more realistic surfaces. </li>
<li>Real-time water reflections and refractions (currently the water is basically a solid blue colour).</li>
<li>Post processing effects including motion blur, colour correction, etc</li>
<li>Occlusion culling, this will increase performance on less powerful machines and make the game more user friendly.</li>
<li>Real-time dynamic shadows cast from all objects within the game world. (Currently there are no shadows, or the shadows are in a permanent state)</li>
</ul>

Sensei Says is the Radeth Productions' Baby. From a fresh start, I really do not have a game or name for the company other than, ""He always releases game demos."" That has all changed with the birth of Sensei, the new avatar for Radeth Productions. Sensei is the Sonic of Radeth Productions. He is cute, funny, easy to look at, player customizable, and the root to a new game franchise!
This first game, in which we I am trying to get funds for, is the starting game to the Sensei franchise (with Ninjascale as the second game in the franchise).
Game-play

You play a ninja who is trying to learn the ways of Sensei. You start out by learning a few moves, then slowly progress until you learn all of the moves in the game (15). As you reach new levels, you apply the skills you learn and try to avoid obstacles in your way. Also, as you make it through the 50 levels, the game slowly progresses and becomes more difficult. In the first levels (easy), you have Sensei talking at a slow pace where you can keep up and understand what he is saying. When you reach the mid levels (medium), Sensei starts to speed up between telling you what to do, and he starts to talk fast and becomes harder to understand. In the more advanced levels (hard and extreme), Sensei starts to realize his life is cutting short and becomes senile. He starts mumbling words, saying random things, and sometimes forgets that he is teaching you how to be a better ninja.
Controls

The controls are fairly easy, but they are still subject to change depending on feedback from consumers. The actions in the game are used by pressing the buttons: Directional arrows, 1-9, Q, W, space, and enter.
Where does it go?

Your money goes straight into the development for the iPhone and MacOSX, marketing, labor for the making of the new game engine, and the art. Right now we only need a minimum amount of money since the majority of the game is already complete. Any extra dollar could help us get the game into production and released to the public (and you if you get a free copy)!
Future Predictions

Although the game will be complete by its first release, there will be major updates to the game to keep content fresh and exciting! In upcoming updates, there will be:

Sensei Customization 
New Achievements 

New Levels 

3 new game modes: Survival, Arcade, CustaLevel (Customize your own level to share and play)
Possible Multi-player
Possible global leader boards

<p>Vitare will be free to play, with limitations. We shall offer a subscription service once released, allowing more features in-game - this shall be our main method of funding once the game is released.</p>
<p>Vitare is a unique game in the gaming market - and no game has currently filled this spot.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why We Require Funding</h3>
<p>We require funding to purchase required software such as Unity Pro in the future, and to allow us to easily startup the game when the time comes, software and servers can be costy, hence why funding would greatly benefit the project. Donations shall also be used for other various things including other software and for the website.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What You Get For Donating</h3>
<p>As a special thanks for donating, depending on how much you donate you shall get a perk. Be sure to check the perks to see what you get when you donate a certain amount.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Thank You</h3>
<p>To anyone that donates, we greatly appreciate helping our indie development team get this game out into the gaming market. Vitare has already received high interest from users of all ages and genders from all over the world. It is an exciting opportunity for us all.</p>

from Diablo and Commandos.

roofs in combat. </span><span>Realistic
day/night cycles, water reflections, particles, fog and rain – all
these features are supported by the modern 3D engine.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Turn-based

every combat member to take its turn. Instead of successive moves all
members (except the player) take their turns simultaneously.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Traps

In the development we set realistic goals,

of these features can

made tech demos for you to check them out online on the game's
website. These features are not just skills
depending on your stats. To pick a lock
you'll have to choose the right shape of
each section of a Decoder pick, with a
limited amount of attempts. For successful
stealing you should take into account sights of view those people who
could see your action.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Improved
AI.</b> So called 'realistic
perception' was borrowed from Commandos
series. You can sneak behind enemies and
use terrain objects to lurk. Don't get into the field of view of your
opponents and don't use firearms until you are noticed or they
will raise alarm and call for their companions. Note that some armor
like helmets, gas masks, sunglasses affect perception.</p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/884360/files/20140926081853-header_weapon_clear.jpg?1411744733"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p><b>NPC-satellites.</b>

Download CRIMEA v.0.8 Demo(added 14.10.14)
CRIMEA
is a single player adventure that takes place on boundless
steppes, radioactive swamps, distinctive settlements and grim
mountain forests of the same-named island.Inspired
by Fallout1 and
Fallout2, CRIMEA also borrows
some features
from Diablo and Commandos.
Though we focus on the combat system you
will also enjoy wandering
around, exploring new locations, trading
and performing quests in this
particular
post-apocalyptic
world.

We
believe you will live out your own story in this severe world, full
of exciting encounters, hot battles, secret places and interesting
quests.

3D
engine. Imagine
Fallout2 gameplay with an option to zoom in/out and rotate the
camera, adjust resolution and quality, using
hills
and
roofs in combat. Realistic
day/night cycles, water reflections, particles, fog and rain – all
these features are supported by the modern 3D engine.

Turn-based
combat with some improvements. Now you don't need to wait for
every combat member to take its turn. Instead of successive moves all
members (except the player) take their turns simultaneously.

Traps
and mines. Use
them to undermine enemy forces. From hornet's
nests and
bear traps to plastic explosives – all's
fair in love and war.


RagDoll physics.
Killed enemies fall more realistic. Those who like
walking on the roofs, sometimes perform
complex
acrobatic
somersaults before
they die.


Lock picking,
Stealing, Gambling.
In the development we set realistic goals,
and some
of these features can
be implemented in
the expanded version only. Though we've
made tech demos for you to check them out online on the game's
website. These features are not just skills
depending on your stats. To pick a lock
you'll have to choose the right shape of
each section of a Decoder pick, with a
limited amount of attempts. For successful
stealing you should take into account sights of view those people who
could see your action.

Improved
AI. So called 'realistic
perception' was borrowed from Commandos
series. You can sneak behind enemies and
use terrain objects to lurk. Don't get into the field of view of your
opponents and don't use firearms until you are noticed or they
will raise alarm and call for their companions. Note that some armor
like helmets, gas masks, sunglasses affect perception.NPC-satellites.
People and other animals will join you, if you are able to interest
them with something. 'Something' can vary from common ideas to few
screw-nuts (main currency on the island).


Open World. Wander through vast Crimean wastelands and feel the spirit of freedom and post-apocalyptic reality. Travel using global map and explore random locations with diverse enemies that will not let you get bored.""Considering this is a demo and the game has so much more to offer 
(according to the game’s feature listing), I was thoroughly impressed 
with what I played so far.""Shawn Schustergame journalist

<p>Kobolds are a dying race.  However, this was not always so.  A thousand years past, the Kobolds were a flourishing civilization, on the brink of conquering the realm... but even the wealth of a hundred nations could not prevent them from being consumed by darkness.  Rumors say thousands of lost souls sank with the once prosperous city into a pit of obscurity, never to be seen again.</p>

<p><strong>Astrea</strong></p>
<p>Astrea has a bright personality, and is typically very easygoing in stark contrast to the grim life she has been handed; she is the sole survivor of her family, all of whom had been slaughtered in a massacre when she was but a child.  Consequently, throughout her life she has had no one whom she could definitively call ""friend"".   Despite her origins, she is swift and nimble.  Her petite frame allows her to hide easily; however, she is not sturdy, meaning that any hit will render her unconscious.  She may be slightly naïve, but her acute wit allows her to escape some of the most difficult situations.  Problem-solving is second nature to her, and puzzles provide a special reprieve from the harsh reality of existence.</p>

<p>Before falling into the necropolis, Astrea had hoped to return to the safe lands to bask in her predetermined wealth and eat heartily.  However, the fall has all but extinguished thoughts of luxury and contentment.  No one would miss her or even know that she was missing—no one would come for her.  Armed with only the light, Aeohfin, and the will to survive, Astrea makes her way through the vast catacombs laden with enveloping darkness and unknown terrors which await unaware souls that just so happen to be unfortunate enough to cross them.</p>

<p>The wisp, Aeohfin, is the only source of light existing in the ruins.  He speaks in an old language that Astrea can only understand in fragments, and seems to be slightly temperamental.  Trapped in the lantern, he agrees to lead Astrea out if she carries him with her, but he tells her little of the past.  Instead, his story is found written in the ruins of Aarnevalkea—a past so dark and convoluted that even he cannot remember it all.  In order to aid her escape, Aeohfin can use his power to momentarily paralyze the darkness, but requires the consumption of food to obtain energy. </p>

<p>The initial inspiration for our game was simple: to create a terrifying, yet fun game that uses the light source as a weapon.  We debated on mechanics and the underlying story for weeks, resulting in the birth of ""Aeohfin"".  Our game uses unique gray scale illustrations, replicative of film noir, to evoke an eerie feeling, disturb your senses, and create an ominous, foreboding atmosphere.</p>

We are Rainbow Panda Studios—an indie game studio producing our first game—a 2D sidescroller Adventure/Horror game that is projected to be released on Steam for PC and XBox in June 2017.  
The initial inspiration for our game was simple: to create a terrifying, yet fun game that uses the light source as a weapon.  We debated on mechanics and the underlying story for weeks, resulting in the birth of ""Aeohfin"".  Our game uses unique gray scale illustrations, replicative of film noir, to evoke an eerie feeling, disturb your senses, and create an ominous, foreboding atmosphere.

Contributing to our campaign will not only help us jump-start our careers, primarily, you will be an important part of our production team by helping us to push this game to commercial success.

<h3><b>A UNIQUE 2D GAMING EXPERIENCE</b></h3>
<h4><b>Who are we ?</b></h4>
<p>We are a team of 4 who would like to bring a unique gaming experience to players of   Shoot Bounce and Catch game. Our dream is to create a game that will be enjoyed by thousands of people. A game that will be engaging and entertaining for all ages, for both young and young at heart. </p>
<h4><b>The STORY behind the game  ?</b></h4>
<p>In the not so distant future, the universe revealed that human beings are not alone and species other than man exist in different galaxies and planets. Among these species, there is  an evil alien named Zowarg leader of an army of alien villains. Zowarg and his armies started to invade planets creating massive destruction  and enslaving its inhabitants.  In response to the violence and destruction expanding from planet to planet , leaders of the galaxies assembled volunteers to be protectors of their planets and created teams to search and stop Zowarg. Planet inhabitants survival now lie on the hands of good alien soldiers dedicated to this cause.  One ordinary good soldier named Furru,  who volunteered to this task has been battling very hard the army of Zowarg. Unfortunately, he realised that Zowarg armies has  already enslaved some of his closest friends. In the midst of the dilemma, Furru’s mission is now torn between finding and stopping Zowarg and his armies or saving his friends.  Join Furru’s exciting journey to search and fight Zowarg and his armies or save his friends.</p>
<h4><b>What’s new ?</b></h4>
<p>Our artists have designed very unique looks of aliens.  The story is original and conceptualized by our game developer and artists to be very engaging for the player. There will be surprises along the way as powerful weapons will be discovered by the players to battle the aliens as you move to the different levels. </p>
<h4><b>What do we need ?</b></h4>
<p>Our project will need some help on funding so that we can spend for software licenses, game peripherals and allowances for our workforce (audio/video director, game artists, game developer and programmer). We have developed around 30% of the game and now working on the design of Zowarg, additional aliens and the alien planet backgrounds. We expect to complete the game by May 2015.

<p><b>Lumo gets kids moving. </b>Mobile games are here to stay, and they can be super educational and fun, but they’re passive. Kids play on Lumo’s 6’ x 4’  interactive surface by , jumping, kicking, stomping, moving, and waving their arms. They play the games they love without sacrificing physical activity.</p>
<p>Also… <b>when you want to clean up the game, you just turn it off</b>. What could be easier?</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>Lumo lets you design your own games. </b>We’ve included easy content creation tools for kids and artists; no coding required. Choose the type of game or effect you want to make, and customize it with your own art. Want to make a soccer game? No problem! Draw your own field, net, and ball and save it to your Lumo. Want to create an interactive play space around a toy castle? Draw a moat, fill it with water and sharks, and project it around the castle. You can even make the sharks interactive, so they attack when something approaches your castle. Seriously cool, right?</p>
<p><b>Kids look at each other instead of at a screen. </b>Unlike existing game consoles, Lumo doesn't hook up to a TV. This is because, with Lumo, kids actually play on and in the game, using their bodies as controllers in a way that they could never do while staring at a screen. Kicking a ball on the floor is a lot more fun than kicking a ball on a screen, trust us. :)</p>
<p><b>Lumo can also be used as a regular projector, to play movies and games. </b>Lumo is built on the Android platform, so existing Android games can be played using a Bluetooth controller (they won't be motion reactive though—developers need to convert their games for motion, using our SDK.). For the price of a regular projector, you’re also getting an interactive play-space, games, and content creation tools—which is pretty cool, if you ask us. :)</p>

<p><b>Lumo will launch with over 100 games available</b> - Below are examples of some of our most popular games. Making games for Lumo is easy - we use the Unity development platform.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>A roadmap to hundreds more games</b> -  Games designed for tablets using Unity can easily be ported to the motion reactive system. We’ll be working with developers to expand the variety of games available for Lumo. Even if a game isn’t motion-reactive, you can use a bluetooth controller<a href=""http://www.impulsecontroller.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> like this one </a>to play any existing Android game.</p>
<p>Our personal favorite game so far is Turtle Hockey, as seen in this demo at Folsom Street Foundry in San Francisco. The turtle gets bored and walks around if you don't kick it, adding a whole new dimension to the game.</p>

<p><b>Children can design and customize their own games for Lumo online by choosing a game template and uploading or drawing their own artwork.</b>They can even adjust game physics using simple sliders, adjusting speed, size, gravity, and other parameters.Once they make a game, they can save it and send it to their Lumo.</p>
<p><b>We plan to launch Lumo with 10 content creation templates</b>:Dance Game, Hockey, Soccer, Pong, Herd Things, Race, Multiple-Choice Tile Game, Scatter (effect), Squash Things (effect), and Pond (effect).</p>
<p>We’ll continue to release templates based on what kids and parents request.</p>

<p>The Lumo team has been designing tools to allow artists to make their own interactive projections for over three years. These simple templates <b>do not require any coding</b>, and <b>use sliders to control behaviors like speed and size</b>. To make game creation simpler for children, we’ve added drawing tools, and we’re currently developing an asset library. Kids create games step-by-step, in a drag &amp; drop format, consistent with other content creation tools for young children.</p>

<p><b>We need to manufacture Lumo! </b>We started developing Lumo in 2013. We are now on the 6th Lumo prototype. It’s significantly smaller than the original. Check out some of our past prototypes, and you’ll see how far we’ve come:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1326171/files/20150325145211-prototypes.PNG?1427320331"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We’ve been funding this project with revenues from commercial work, and we’re almost there. But our team is also bigger, and we need a bunch of stuff done in factories. That’s why we’re asking for help. </span><b>Here's what we need to move Lumo from prototype to manufacturing:</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Lens tooling</b> - Lumo has a bigger than average throw ratio (in order to create the biggest possible game area at the shortest possible distance). We need to have a special tool made just for Lumo so our projector gives kids a bright, wide play space.</p>
<p><b>Final DFM </b>(design for manufacturing) - including smaller case design and integrated projector module. It’s easy to make one prototype, but now we need a design that can be replicated—and tested!—thousands of times in a factory.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>SDK and app market development</b> - we’ve expanded our team to work on the Lumo SDK development and provide direct support to a development community. We want to make sure we build developer support and resources that make sense, and that encourage game creators to participate in the Lumo project and port their hundreds of existing games to it. We also need to refine the mobile app which is used as a controller.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Factory setup</b> - we will be choosing a factory in the next few months. We have relationships with a few. Our final choice will depend on the success of the campaign and how many Lumos we have to make. We will need things like test jigs, tools and molds.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Package design </b>- Lumo will be sold online initially, so we won’t be spending a ton of money on a fancy package. But we do need something that passes a drop test and can withstand travel. We also need a setup document (which will be easy) and a warranty program (which will be harder).</p>
<p><b>Certification and Testing </b>- We need to get Lumo certified before we can retail it. Since the components are all relatively common, this shouldn't be a problem, but it is an expense.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1326226/files/20150325151136-how-the-interactive-parts-work.png?1427321496"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>Lumo uses a simple sensor and clever programming to detect motion.</b>This is different from solutions like Kinect and Leap Motion, which collect point cloud info using lasers. Lumo uses ambient IR light and a built-in, low resolution sensor to see whether something is moving or present on the projection area. Our patent-pending tracking algorithms do all the hard work, allowing interaction with the projected image.</p>

<p><b>Lumo hangs on the wall </b>using a small, safe, wall mounting bracket with a child lock out of reach of tiny hands. A standard power adapter (just like a laptop adapter) plugs into the wall. The projector ball swivels, so you can also mount Lumo from the ceiling.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1336818/files/20150329154116-hang_lumo_on_the_wall.png?1427668876"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>When you want to play movies, just release the top latch and put Lumo on the table. You can even put Lumo on a bedside table and project on the ceiling. Another stretch goal is content designed for the ceiling, to ease your child into peaceful dreams. They can count real sheep!</p>
<p><b>It’s plug and play</b> - Lumo creates games right away. You don’t need to hook anything up. There are no controllers. Just hang it up, turn it on, and start playing.</p>
<p><b>It also plays movies </b>- connect Lumo to your computer, Chromecast, or Apple TV via an HDMI input to watch movies and TV.</p>
<p><b>You can take it anywhere</b> - Lumo fits in a bag. You can’t fit your TV and Xbox in a bag. Just saying.<br/></p>
<p><b>You don’t just play Lumo; you create and customize its games </b>- To make their own games, kids register their Lumo on Lumoplay.com and use the template tools in their account. When they’re done, they can send their games straight to Lumo.</p>
<p>For example, making a soccer game is three steps. 1) draw a field, 2) draw the nets and 3) draw the ball. When you're done, press a button and the game is sent to your Lumo. It's that easy.</p>

<p><b>Children spend 40 hours per week in front of a screen</b>, which <a href=""http://breakingmuscle.com/family-kids/wired-kids-how-screen-time-affects-childrens-brains"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">may stunt their social and cognitive development</a>. Lumo addresses this problem by creating compelling interactive digital experiences <b>in the real world</b> to help develop large motor-skills and social skills. Children look at each other while jumping, running, and moving around, instead of staring at a screen. Like zombies. Because that's disturbing, right?</p>
<p><b>Lumo's patent-pending technology makes these experiences affordable for families for the first time</b>. You've probably seen our software in malls and museums - we've been doing this for a while. But now, we're able to do it without using an expensive computer and projector. That means your kids can play with interactive projections at home. They can even make their own games!</p>
<p><b>This needs to happen</b> - We’ve spent three years and invested our own money to build an entirely new kind of entertainment experience for kids, because we’ve seen first-hand how much kids and adults love playing with it. And we want to get the world playing and moving again.</p>

<p>The Lumo team includes <b>7 designers, developers, and engineers</b> with over 20 years of combined experience developing computer vision and games, and building world-class interactive installations. Together, we’ve launched a successful interactive projection software platform for artists and advertisers that’s working in thousands of locations around the world right now; and we’ve created dozens of custom installations for museums, educational institutions, and sensory labs.</p>
<p>We have a  deep understanding of the unique challenges of designing motion reactive projection experiences for kids. Challenges you may not have thought of, like detecting motion without lasers; making installation easy; automating complex lighting and calibration; building affordable hardware platforms; and managing remote upgrades. And of course, making games fun.</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Making hardware is hard, and lots of things can go wrong.</span><b> Here are the three biggest risks and how we've mitigated them:</b></p>
<p><b>We don't raise enough to manufacture in a factory. </b>This is a possibility; Indiegogo is a flexible funding platform and we may not reach our goal. We have set the perk price for Lumo a bit higher than we'd like because NO MATTER WHAT, we will be able to make Lumo for this price. Even if we can't make them in a factory and we're forced to make each one by hand.</p>
<p><b>We don't raise enough for lens tooling. </b>If this happens, we will use an off-the-shelf lens. This means the throw ratio (the size of the projection) will be a bit smaller than we'd like. But Lumo will still work, and it will still be awesome.</p>
<p><b>We don't finish all the features of the software. </b>Lumo, as it exists right now, has ten games and works on the Android platform using a mouse as a controller. We travel the world showing it to people; you can see the actual Lumo prototype in all the videos. We will launch with a mobile app so you can control, load, and create games using your phone. However, this is a pretty big project. If the hardware is done first, we may ship with a limited number of features and push updates to the software afterwards.</p>

<strong>Can you explain Lumo in a sentence?</strong> <br/>Lumo is an entirely new kind of toy that turns a floor into an interactive play space.<br/><br/><strong>Can you explain Lumo in a paragraph?</strong><br/>Lumo is an entirely new kind of toy. It projects a large playfield onto a floor, creating colourful interactive games that get kids moving. Created over three years by a team of designers, artists, and engineers, it offers the fun and engagement of virtual worlds with the physical movement of traditional playtime.<br/><br/><strong>Where did the idea come from?</strong><br/>For years, Lumo Play’s founders built installations and created software tools for interactive, projected environments in museums, tradeshows, schools and businesses. Parents asked for a home version, but existing solutions were expensive, complicated, and hard to maintain. Co-founder and CEO Meghan Athavale saw how much children loved playing games on tablets and computers, but wanted a way to make playtime physical again—and Lumo was born. “I remember what it was like to run, jump, and dream as a kid,” said Lumo CEO Meghan Athavale. “I wanted to make that possible again, without losing all the awesome things that video games and modern apps have to offer.”<br/><br/><strong>What’s changed that makes this possible today?</strong><br/>Three things.<br/><ol>
<li>The cost of computing has dropped. Mobile operating systems such as Android and Linux, and solid-state computing tools that require no cooling are much more affordable.</li>
<li><span>Imaging technology is more affordable. Lumo uses an ingenious combination of infrared projection, filters, and overmapping to create a motion-reactive interface that’s self-calibrating and doesn’t consume significant computing power or introduce latency.</span></li>
<li>Bright, long-life projectors. Miniature, LED-powered pico-projectors use energy efficiently, occupy less space, weigh less, and have significantly longer lifespans than traditional projectors.</li>
</ol>
<br/><strong>How much of Lumo’s technology did you invent?</strong><br/>Lumo is a full-stack toy platform. The entire motion capture chain was developed by the company, and games are built atop the industry-standard Unity development tool set. Lumo uses modified off-the-shelf components to save costs where possible, but includes elements like a custom lens to create a bright, wide play field for games. The company has five patents filed (one granted) relating to motion capture, mobile projection, and augmented reality tagging. “It’s amazing how much you wind up inventing when you’re trying to create something entirely new,” said co-founder Curtis Wachs.<br/><br/><strong>How long did it take you to develop Lumo?</strong><br/>Development of Lumo began in 2013, but much of the underlying know-how came from the founders’ experiences designing interactive installations as <a href=""http://www.lumointeractive.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lumo Interactive</a> and creating software tools for others to build installations as <a href=""http://www.po-motion.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Po-motion.com</a>. Po-motion has been used by global brands, agencies, museums, and event space in over 4,000 deployments worldwide.<br/><br/><strong>How do you make this kind of technology affordable?</strong><br/>Partly, improvements in performance and reductions in cost have come from Moore’s Law and the declining cost of components. But even with these savings, getting the cost of the platform down has taken clever engineering, repurposing common parts and writing software that makes the most of those components.<br/><br/><strong>Have you taken investment to create the product?</strong><br/>Lumo Play has been entirely self-funded by the founding team, as well as by revenues from the operation of Po-motion and Lumo Interactive. The company received a small investment as part of their participation in the Highway 1 accelerator program in 2014, where they identified ideal components and started developing manufacturing partnerships.<br/><br/><strong>Where can I use Lumo Play?</strong><br/>Lumo Play mounts on any ceiling or wall with a simple fixture, and requires only a wall socket for power. It’s designed for indoor play, and works best on light-coloured floors; some beta testers put down white foam tiles as a play surface to reduce slipperiness and increase reflectivity.<br/><br/><strong>Where do the games come from?</strong><br/>Lumo Play will ship with roughly 100 games, created in the Unity development environment. Many of these are ported from Po-motion’s library of popular games and interactive scenes; others are entirely new for Lumo Play.<br/><br/><strong>Can third-party developers build games?</strong><br/>Yes. Developers can easily port their games to Lumo Play’s motion-reactive interface. Lumo Play offers a Software Development Kit (SDK), as well as guidelines around colour and layout, to make it easy to move tap-and-swipe gestures to full-body movements, opening up a vast range of third-party applications for the toy. Even without porting games to motion reaction, those games can be played with an external controller for the device.<br/><br/><strong>Can I use Lumo Play for anything else?</strong><br/>Lumo Play includes a full-featured pico projector, and has an HDMI interface, so it can function as an external projector for watching videos.<br/><br/><strong>What ages is Lumo Play aimed at?</strong><br/>It’s aimed at children from 2-12 years old. Young toddlers love Lumo Play’s simple, reactive scenes and bright visuals; older children play more sophisticated games, use educational applications, and create their own custom games. The toy is designed to grow with a child, offering a range of age-appropriate games as children get older. “Making a toy that changed as a child did was a core design principle of Lumo Play,” said Meghan.<br/><br/><strong>How do children create their own games?</strong><br/>Lumo Play includes simple web-based customization tools that let children change the artwork and design of the game. The tools are based on <a href=""http://www.po-motion.com/make-custom-interactive-floor-wall-projection"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Po-motion’s patented Motion Maker</a>, but completely re-engineered to be easy for children to learn.<br/><br/><strong>When will Lumo Play be available to the public?</strong><br/>The current target for delivery is 2017, but exact times will depend on the amount of funding raised on Indiegogo, who we partner with, and how many people want one.

</div></div>","Here are some great ways to use Lumo Play:
In the livingroom, for active indoor play.
In a child's bedroom - they can make their own games and effects.
In the classroom to keep kids active while they learn.
To help kids with sensory sensitivities and Autism.
In a small business. Make your brand more fun.
At your event.
Here is what our early adopters get:


100+ games included.


A year's free Content Creation account, so you and your family can make your as many games as you want using tools designed for kids.


The coolest toy invented in a really long time! Join our community and help make Lumo happen!


Lumo Play is plug and play. Hang it up, turn it on, play games. It's that simple.


You can even use Lumo Play as a regular projector! Just point it at the wall and plug into the HDMI port. It's super portable, bright enough for any room with the lights off, (even during the day) and the bulb lasts 40,000 hours. Lumo supports your computer, laptop, Apple TV, Chromecast and other playback devices.



 


Lumo gets kids moving. Mobile games are here to stay, and they can be super educational and fun, but they’re passive. Kids play on Lumo’s 6’ x 4’  interactive surface by , jumping, kicking, stomping, moving, and waving their arms. They play the games they love without sacrificing physical activity.
Also… when you want to clean up the game, you just turn it off. What could be easier?





Lumo lets you design your own games. We’ve included easy content creation tools for kids and artists; no coding required. Choose the type of game or effect you want to make, and customize it with your own art. Want to make a soccer game? No problem! Draw your own field, net, and ball and save it to your Lumo. Want to create an interactive play space around a toy castle? Draw a moat, fill it with water and sharks, and project it around the castle. You can even make the sharks interactive, so they attack when something approaches your castle. Seriously cool, right?
Kids look at each other instead of at a screen. Unlike existing game consoles, Lumo doesn't hook up to a TV. This is because, with Lumo, kids actually play on and in the game, using their bodies as controllers in a way that they could never do while staring at a screen. Kicking a ball on the floor is a lot more fun than kicking a ball on a screen, trust us. :)
Lumo can also be used as a regular projector, to play movies and games. Lumo is built on the Android platform, so existing Android games can be played using a Bluetooth controller (they won't be motion reactive though—developers need to convert their games for motion, using our SDK.). For the price of a regular projector, you’re also getting an interactive play-space, games, and content creation tools—which is pretty cool, if you ask us. :)


Lumo will launch with over 100 games available - Below are examples of some of our most popular games. Making games for Lumo is easy - we use the Unity development platform.





A roadmap to hundreds more games -  Games designed for tablets using Unity can easily be ported to the motion reactive system. We’ll be working with developers to expand the variety of games available for Lumo. Even if a game isn’t motion-reactive, you can use a bluetooth controller like this one to play any existing Android game.
Our personal favorite game so far is Turtle Hockey, as seen in this demo at Folsom Street Foundry in San Francisco. The turtle gets bored and walks around if you don't kick it, adding a whole new dimension to the game.




Children can design and customize their own games for Lumo online by choosing a game template and uploading or drawing their own artwork.They can even adjust game physics using simple sliders, adjusting speed, size, gravity, and other parameters.Once they make a game, they can save it and send it to their Lumo.
We plan to launch Lumo with 10 content creation templates:Dance Game, Hockey, Soccer, Pong, Herd Things, Race, Multiple-Choice Tile Game, Scatter (effect), Squash Things (effect), and Pond (effect).
We’ll continue to release templates based on what kids and parents request.




The Lumo team has been designing tools to allow artists to make their own interactive projections for over three years. These simple templates do not require any coding, and use sliders to control behaviors like speed and size. To make game creation simpler for children, we’ve added drawing tools, and we’re currently developing an asset library. Kids create games step-by-step, in a drag & drop format, consistent with other content creation tools for young children.



MashableLumo projector turns kids' bedrooms into interactive game rooms.Kids love using their imaginations to envision lava on the bedroom floor and the park as a jungle. And now, a new device called the Lumo takes these visions and projects them onto the floor, turning just about anywhere into an interactive play space.
Computer WorldAfter all these years of ""computerization,"" something wonderful is about to happen: Our interface to the world of computers will leap off of the screen and onto the walls, floors, ceilings, tabletops, windows and other surfaces in our homes and offices, and in public spaces.

Augmented World ExpoThis week’s find is an interactive projector called Lumo. Remember when your floor was made of lava? Or when you spent hours exploring magical forests filled with imaginary creatures in your room? Well Lumo takes this imaginary game play to a whole new level by turning the real world into a magical playground for children. 
rAVe PublicationsGet Ready to be Completely Blown Away by the Best Pico Projector Ever.The vision of CEO Meg Athavale, LUMO integrates a pico-projector, Android software, a motion IR sensor and Wi-Fi into a wall-mounted sphere that makes any surface interactive for kid’s gaming.

We need to manufacture Lumo! We started developing Lumo in 2013. We are now on the 6th Lumo prototype. It’s significantly smaller than the original. Check out some of our past prototypes, and you’ll see how far we’ve come:


We’ve been funding this project with revenues from commercial work, and we’re almost there. But our team is also bigger, and we need a bunch of stuff done in factories. That’s why we’re asking for help. Here's what we need to move Lumo from prototype to manufacturing:

Lens tooling - Lumo has a bigger than average throw ratio (in order to create the biggest possible game area at the shortest possible distance). We need to have a special tool made just for Lumo so our projector gives kids a bright, wide play space.
Final DFM (design for manufacturing) - including smaller case design and integrated projector module. It’s easy to make one prototype, but now we need a design that can be replicated—and tested!—thousands of times in a factory.

SDK and app market development - we’ve expanded our team to work on the Lumo SDK development and provide direct support to a development community. We want to make sure we build developer support and resources that make sense, and that encourage game creators to participate in the Lumo project and port their hundreds of existing games to it. We also need to refine the mobile app which is used as a controller.

Factory setup - we will be choosing a factory in the next few months. We have relationships with a few. Our final choice will depend on the success of the campaign and how many Lumos we have to make. We will need things like test jigs, tools and molds.

Package design - Lumo will be sold online initially, so we won’t be spending a ton of money on a fancy package. But we do need something that passes a drop test and can withstand travel. We also need a setup document (which will be easy) and a warranty program (which will be harder).
Certification and Testing - We need to get Lumo certified before we can retail it. Since the components are all relatively common, this shouldn't be a problem, but it is an expense.



Lumo uses a simple sensor and clever programming to detect motion.This is different from solutions like Kinect and Leap Motion, which collect point cloud info using lasers. Lumo uses ambient IR light and a built-in, low resolution sensor to see whether something is moving or present on the projection area. Our patent-pending tracking algorithms do all the hard work, allowing interaction with the projected image.





Lumo hangs on the wall using a small, safe, wall mounting bracket with a child lock out of reach of tiny hands. A standard power adapter (just like a laptop adapter) plugs into the wall. The projector ball swivels, so you can also mount Lumo from the ceiling.



When you want to play movies, just release the top latch and put Lumo on the table. You can even put Lumo on a bedside table and project on the ceiling. Another stretch goal is content designed for the ceiling, to ease your child into peaceful dreams. They can count real sheep!
It’s plug and play - Lumo creates games right away. You don’t need to hook anything up. There are no controllers. Just hang it up, turn it on, and start playing.
It also plays movies - connect Lumo to your computer, Chromecast, or Apple TV via an HDMI input to watch movies and TV.
You can take it anywhere - Lumo fits in a bag. You can’t fit your TV and Xbox in a bag. Just saying.
You don’t just play Lumo; you create and customize its games - To make their own games, kids register their Lumo on Lumoplay.com and use the template tools in their account. When they’re done, they can send their games straight to Lumo.
For example, making a soccer game is three steps. 1) draw a field, 2) draw the nets and 3) draw the ball. When you're done, press a button and the game is sent to your Lumo. It's that easy.






We’ve figured out how to make toys become controllers. Lumo recognizes them, and paints them with light, changing how they look. A toy car becomes a spaceship—and catches on fire as it takes damage! We’re working on adding this tech to Lumo down the road, and if we hit some of our stretch goals, we’ll make it happen in the first release.





Children spend 40 hours per week in front of a screen, which may stunt their social and cognitive development. Lumo addresses this problem by creating compelling interactive digital experiences in the real world to help develop large motor-skills and social skills. Children look at each other while jumping, running, and moving around, instead of staring at a screen. Like zombies. Because that's disturbing, right?
Lumo's patent-pending technology makes these experiences affordable for families for the first time. You've probably seen our software in malls and museums - we've been doing this for a while. But now, we're able to do it without using an expensive computer and projector. That means your kids can play with interactive projections at home. They can even make their own games!
This needs to happen - We’ve spent three years and invested our own money to build an entirely new kind of entertainment experience for kids, because we’ve seen first-hand how much kids and adults love playing with it. And we want to get the world playing and moving again.

The Lumo team includes 7 designers, developers, and engineers with over 20 years of combined experience developing computer vision and games, and building world-class interactive installations. Together, we’ve launched a successful interactive projection software platform for artists and advertisers that’s working in thousands of locations around the world right now; and we’ve created dozens of custom installations for museums, educational institutions, and sensory labs.
We have a  deep understanding of the unique challenges of designing motion reactive projection experiences for kids. Challenges you may not have thought of, like detecting motion without lasers; making installation easy; automating complex lighting and calibration; building affordable hardware platforms; and managing remote upgrades. And of course, making games fun.



Founder and CEO Meghan Athavale has been an artist, musician, VJ, animator, and interactive designer. She’s founded two other companies in addition to Lumo. A sought-after speaker on play, immersive environments, and technology, she’s  spoken at events such as SXSW, TEDx, and Ignite, and has published a report on Data and Play for O'Reilly Media. She participated in Highway1's hardware incubator last spring to finalize Lumo’s production readiness, and has visited China to work directly with component manufacturers and factories. Meghan was recently featured on the front page of Slashdot, speaking about Lumo at SXSW Interactive.
Lumo's platform, content creation tools, and app market are being developed by the team behind the best-selling Po-motion.com interactive projection platform, launched in 2011. Meghan Athavale, Keith Otto, Curtis Wachs and Jocelyne Le Leannec invented and developed the software, website and content over a period of 3 years. While building Po-motion, Jocelyne spent her days speaking to artists, advertisers, and audio-visual installers, and relaying their suggestions to Keith and Curt, who spent years constantly improving the software interface, website, and features.
Keith Otto interviewed by Daily Planet at SXSW 2014

We've added two new software engineers to the team since we started creating Lumo. Steve Chubaty and Chris Iverach-Brereton are creating the game SDK and improving the motion detection algorithms.
Lumo's hardware was developed in the Highway 1 incubator by Pedro Pereira, who worked with Meghan to source components and integrate them into a smaller, easier form factor, and collaborated with industrial designers and concept artists to develop the case for Lumo.





Making hardware is hard, and lots of things can go wrong. Here are the three biggest risks and how we've mitigated them:
We don't raise enough to manufacture in a factory. This is a possibility; Indiegogo is a flexible funding platform and we may not reach our goal. We have set the perk price for Lumo a bit higher than we'd like because NO MATTER WHAT, we will be able to make Lumo for this price. Even if we can't make them in a factory and we're forced to make each one by hand.
We don't raise enough for lens tooling. If this happens, we will use an off-the-shelf lens. This means the throw ratio (the size of the projection) will be a bit smaller than we'd like. But Lumo will still work, and it will still be awesome.
We don't finish all the features of the software. Lumo, as it exists right now, has ten games and works on the Android platform using a mouse as a controller. We travel the world showing it to people; you can see the actual Lumo prototype in all the videos. We will launch with a mobile app so you can control, load, and create games using your phone. However, this is a pretty big project. If the hardware is done first, we may ship with a limited number of features and push updates to the software afterwards.




We know you want to help make Lumo a reality. If you can't back our project, we understand. After all, we've all been bootstrapping a hardware product for over two years (so we're not exactly rich, and we’ve eaten a lot of Instant Ramen Noodles.) Here are some other things you can do that will help us a lot:

including all of the updated retail discounts and coupons promoted on

services for the upcoming holidays?  These funds will be allocated to start
that process.  </p>
<p>Your support will help us cover
the cost of software developer’s time, server contract commitments and systems
integration and testing prior to the World market launch.Any additional funds
will be allocated to the final stages of mobile app development. <br/><br/>
We have invested well over $150,000 of our own funds for design, patent filing,
software validation and programming. We're almost at the finish line, and you can help us get there.<br/></p>

<p>DESi was created by many talented designers under the guidance of the DESi
founders, collectively known as ""Team DESi"". Team DESi has many
decades of successful experience in Advertising, Broadcast Media, IP
Technology, Retail, and Customer - Oriented Business Development. <br/></p>
<p>This hybridized collection of experience and intellectual property contributed to the original idea, “How can we assemble the right moving parts for consumers to get what they really want, when they want/need it, save them money, control the process and let them have fun doing it?” </p>
<p>Team DESi identified those moving parts to be building a unique technology platform, incorporating merchants/advertisers/providers, integrating broadcast/internet/print/mobile media and local communities.</p>
<p>For two years we’ve been designing, building, and gathering all the moving parts. We welcome your help to participate in the completion of this innovative platform we call DESi.<br/></p>

DESi is an intuitive mobile application born from
2 years of research and design, brought to you from a small team of designers
with big imaginations who've built an innovative platform connecting people,
community, merchants, and media.
The DESi team has built a game-changing application that will
collect, filter and auto-deliver the latest deals and details on fashion, cars,
restaurants, electronics, program entertainment, concerts, music,  videos,
news, information, broadcast and internet programming - or anything you choose -
including all of the updated retail discounts and coupons promoted on
broadcast, internet or mobile devices, because DESi mines all of those sources
using your preferences as filters.  You get deals, details and discounts from local,
regional and national retailers in all categories, delivered efficiently and
priority sensitive.


How Does DESi Work?


Once the DESi app is downloaded (iOS, Android)
you simply set up your preferences profile that builds DESi’s intelligence.
Your profile information will tell DESi what to
look for - it’s that simple. DESi's intuitive functionality works on your behalf
24-7, searching for Art retailers to Zumba studios and everything in between. But it's
not just goods and services, it's also content, activities and people. DESi
brings it all to your smartphone, tablet or PC, organized for your review at
your convenience.


App Features


DESi knows you may not think of everything, so there are a lot of very
cool features available to you.
Let's say you're driving in your car or watching TV
and you hear a commercial. Maybe it's about a new restaurant that sounds like a
perfect place to get together with your friends on Saturday night. 

'EVA' 
Simply press the DESi icon on your phone or
tablet and DESi's Embedded Voice Awareness ('EVA') will recognize your voice and pin the commercial/special that you just heard. The restaurant particulars,
along with any discounts or coupons, are instantly delivered to you, and can
immediately be shared with your friends too.

'FETCH' - Find & Retrieve

If its news or information you want, just select your location preferences
and DESi will seek and find what you want through its innovative Premium
Feature we call FETCH. Whether you want NYC, Austin, Texas or Billings,
 Montana or all three - you simply
set the parameters and DESi does the rest. 
Each and every day you'll receive the news specific to NYC, Austin and Billings.
FETCH will bring you the news, sports, weather, activities, travel,
entertainment, movie stuff, original TV, radio and web programming neatly
tucked away ready to review when you are.

'NANS' - New Artists New Songs

About Us & Our Experience


DESi was created by many talented designers under the guidance of the DESi
founders, collectively known as ""Team DESi"". Team DESi has many
decades of successful experience in Advertising, Broadcast Media, IP
Technology, Retail, and Customer - Oriented Business Development. 
This hybridized collection of experience and intellectual property contributed to the original idea, “How can we assemble the right moving parts for consumers to get what they really want, when they want/need it, save them money, control the process and let them have fun doing it?” 
Team DESi identified those moving parts to be building a unique technology platform, incorporating merchants/advertisers/providers, integrating broadcast/internet/print/mobile media and local communities.
For two years we’ve been designing, building, and gathering all the moving parts. We welcome your help to participate in the completion of this innovative platform we call DESi.

Our Passion & Motivation


The DESi team has a passion to give back to its community and has supported
many needy and worthy charities over the years and feel it mandatory to select
a charity of choice for our company to support. 
Once DESi has been funded and we are operating, we will annually poll our
membership with a multiple - choice selection of several charities that meet our
criteria. The charity selected by our members w",7.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>Why It Matters</h3><div><br/></div><div>
</div>The south wind that blew on April 26th 1986 brought 70% of the nuclear leakage into Belarus, polluting one fourth of the nation’s territory and more than 3,600 settlements. Ever since, newborns have suffered from gene mutation, mental deficiency, physical disability and cancer. In the vast contaminated land of over 47,000 square kilometers, radioactive level is at least seven times higher than maximum habitable standard set by the International Atomic Energy Agency.<br/><br/>Twenty-eight years later, <b>two million people have still lived in these areas</b>. The disaster has severely affected agricultural harvesting, gathering, and people’s daily lives. Children are taught not to touch the soil, pick up flowers, go into waters,<br/>climb trees, and even to be close with the nature.  Young people from the regions are given one-to-three months overseas “healthy holidays”to get away from radiation, while many senior citizens retreat from the zone and perish with mutilation in urban shelters.<br/><br/>Radiation damage is a long-persisting course. Cesium-137, which contaminates the land most, has a half-life cycle of 30 years. The USSR initially claimed that the total death toll due to the Chernobyl accident was 31 people. Three decades later, estimate of associated deaths has reached over one million. The number is still rising, with many of the residents finding no way to improve their situations.<br/><br/>Due to financial difficulty, many relief programs have been halt since 10 years ago. The Belarusian government has altered radiation standards for agricultural products and living condition, claiming the situation is a lot more 'safe' from then. For intellectuals and artists, traumas linking to the relief process are often a forbidden topic, and related works and discussions are heavily censored by the government, making it considerably difficult for the sufferers to tell their stories from the inside. Most of them are still unknown to the outside world.<br/><br/>With many of the survivors fading away, we wish our involvements can help keep their words told and memories alive.<div></div><div><br/></div><div>

<h3>As for the risks</h3>
<div><span><br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some Belarusians often joke about their country being the ""last dictatorship of Europe"". Government control of free expression is significantly high, and freedom of speech in the nation is still among the lowest in Europe. (You can refer to <a href=""http://rsf.org/index2014/en-index2014.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">World Press Freedom Index</a><span class=""wrc_icon wrc11""></span> by Reporters Without Borders, <a href=""http://pages.eiu.com/rs/eiu2/images/Democracy-Index-2012.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Democracy Index</a><span class=""wrc_icon wrc0""></span> by the<p>Economist Intelligence Unit, <span>and other freedom indices) </span>Discussion of topics regarding Chernobyl aftermath and future of nuclear energy has been under tight censorship. With the fear of being beaten and jailed by the government, people are often afraid of carrying out public demonstrations of expressing criticism.</p></span></div><br/>As we attempt to maintain in low profiles while proceeding with the project inside Belarus, there are still potential difficulties gathering sources for information. In the worst case, actions by the local authorities might limit the extent to which the project can be accomplished. We have experience working in places with authoritarian regimes around the world, and will strive to ensure the best outcomes given such circumstance.<br/><br/>In the unfortunate case which stops us from accomplishing the entire goal, the remaining fund will be donated to organizations that have long devoted to Chernobyl relief.

Together we have worked on a 125-page reportage regarding the Ethiopian Gibe dam project <We Strive to Build Our Homes>, the contents (in Mandarin and two parts) can be seen here: Part A  /  Part BWith the help of the locals, this July we travelled into the Belarusian zone using cameras and Geiger counters in documenting the general public’s lives and thoughts. Ever since, we have been in contact with Belarusian institutions and international NGOs. We wish to return in November for a more detailed documentation, and to deliver the stories to broader awareness.This current project is part of our continuing pursuit of this topic –how people livewith their homes, and how they deal with ongoing challenges that are about to change their lives.

Why It Matters
The south wind that blew on April 26th 1986 brought 70% of the nuclear leakage into Belarus, polluting one fourth of the nation’s territory and more than 3,600 settlements. Ever since, newborns have suffered from gene mutation, mental deficiency, physical disability and cancer. In the vast contaminated land of over 47,000 square kilometers, radioactive level is at least seven times higher than maximum habitable standard set by the International Atomic Energy Agency.Twenty-eight years later, two million people have still lived in these areas. The disaster has severely affected agricultural harvesting, gathering, and people’s daily lives. Children are taught not to touch the soil, pick up flowers, go into waters,climb trees, and even to be close with the nature.  Young people from the regions are given one-to-three months overseas “healthy holidays”to get away from radiation, while many senior citizens retreat from the zone and perish with mutilation in urban shelters.Radiation damage is a long-persisting course. Cesium-137, which contaminates the land most, has a half-life cycle of 30 years. The USSR initially claimed that the total death toll due to the Chernobyl accident was 31 people. Three decades later, estimate of associated deaths has reached over one million. The number is still rising, with many of the residents finding no way to improve their situations.Due to financial difficulty, many relief programs have been halt since 10 years ago. The Belarusian government has altered radiation standards for agricultural products and living condition, claiming the situation is a lot more 'safe' from then. For intellectuals and artists, traumas linking to the relief process are often a forbidden topic, and related works and discussions are heavily censored by the government, making it considerably difficult for the sufferers to tell their stories from the inside. Most of them are still unknown to the outside world.With many of the survivors fading away, we wish our involvements can help keep their words told and memories alive.

The Goal


Our aim is to conduct a web-based multi-media coverage. Utilizing our diverse backgrounds in journalism and visual arts, we attempt to deliver the reportage as a multi-media website, combining text, images, motion graphics, and audio from the location.  To demonstrate the desired effect, we provide two respected references from Magnum Photos and New York Times.<The Places We Live> by Magnum Photos <A Game of Shark and Minnow> by New York TimesWith this method, we invite viewers to immerse in the Belarusian scene with us, and experience the lives and thoughts of people there. The website will be delivered in both English and Mandarin versions, and we will update the contents for at least three consecutive years –across the 29th-31st anniversary of Chernobyl disaster and completion of the new Belarusian nuclear plant.Through the Belarusian experience, we wish to document the common struggle that many of us face against vast menaces, and capture people’s persisting faith for home, albeit their littleness.With down to earth documentation, we wish the stories of these people could provide positive references for a world with crucial choices, before they perish.The website will contain the following elements –




Text: 30000+ words coverage combining statistic information and
first-hand observations. Individual stories of specific memories and lives,
based on family or individual figure, will be delivered in essays of 500 words.

Image: 40+ high-res images from 35mm/120 film transfer, focusing on documentation of daily lives. Plus Geiger counter images with various backgrounds across Belarus.
Motion: Recorded footages that present as Video and Cinemagraph 
Audio: Recorded on each location with interviews and environmental sounds, and delivered according to website design.


 


Behind the monument is the forbidden 'zone' across the river. Original residents are allowed one day per year to enter and mourn for their deceased ones. 
How We Can Make It Happen

In order to launch and complete the project, we need funds to cover the following aspects:

Air Transportation:$3000 USD - covering both visits for two people, from Taiwan and Prague. 
Geiger Counter: $250 USD - for safety and validating contamination
Daily Expenses: $3600 USD - $60 per day x 2 people x 30 Days - local transportation, accommodation, food, interpreter, communication etc.

Paperworks: $750 USD - visa fee, invitation letters etc.; for both visits

Website Design: $4000 USD - based on the quality demonstrated in reference websites
Website Maintenance: $648 USD - Hosting fee $18/month x 3 years
Translation of Bilingual web content: $2000 USD
Expendables: $700 USD - Films, accessories, payment for sensitive contents etc.

Gross amount: 14,948 USD. We wish the crowd-funding campaign can at least cover 40% of the total expense.For your contribution, we will prepare unique local treats to share with you the warmth of the land and its people :) Lovely sweets and traditional craft items await friends that help telling the stories.For people with outstanding contributions, individually hand-processed photo prints from the accomplished reportage will be given! With contributions at higher levels, one can have a chance to select his or her favorite images and turn them into unique postcards or gorgeous BIG color prints.
With a contribution of more than $50 USD before November 20th, one can also receive a postcard from Belarus with our greetings!




Youngsters on a two-day shift at the state-owned farm 18 kilometers from Chernobyl Plant. The farm has 367 cattle and supplies nearby towns with dairy products.

As for the risks

Some Belarusians often joke about their country being the ""last dictatorship of Europe"". Government control of free expression is significantly high, and freedom of speech in the nation is still among the lowest in Europe. (You can refer to World Press Freedom Index by Reporters Without Borders, Democracy Index by theEconomist Intelligence Unit, and other freedom indices) Discussion of topics regarding Chernobyl aftermath and future of nuclear energy has been under tight censorship. With the fear of being beaten and jailed by the government, people are often afraid of carrying out public demonstrations of expressing criticism.As we attempt to maintain in low profiles while proceeding with the project inside Belarus, there are still potential difficulties gathering sources for information. In the worst case, actions by the local authorities might limit the extent to which the project can be accomplished. We have experience working in places with authoritarian regimes around the world, and will strive to ensure the best outcomes given such circumstance.In the unfortunate case which stops us from accomplishing the entire goal, the remaining fund will be donated to organizations that have long devoted to Chernobyl relief. You can find some of these dedicated organizations here.   


Radiation reading at the dairy farm. Yearly dosage that the workers here receive will exceed the 1 mSv standard set by IAEA. As mentioned above, the farm also supplies milk for the nearby towns.

Help us do more  We sincerely wish that with your contribution, these stories can bring positive changes, and furthermore foster new thoughts that relates to our homes.Please help us reach more possibilities by sharing this campaign with your friends and people you think that can help make it happen :) You can use the share buttons found on the beginning of the page to mail it, post it, link to it, and follow our new updates. Please spread the word.With your participation, we keep the stories alive.Thank YOU.Lungyin Lim16 Oct. 2013 @Prague, Czech Republic",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

</tbody></table><br/></div>","Take a Table-Top Trip to Michigan's Historic Heart of the Great Lakes!NOTE: Due to recent publicity, or campaign has been extended until June 27, 2014.If you're like us, you love to visit Mackinac Island, but you can only visit occasionally. We created Mackinac Island Treasure Hunt Card and Board Games (MITH) as a fun way to re-create the best things about a trip to the Island: Discovering new things, exploring the woods and historic places, and good times with friends and family.In a world where everything is moving fast and technology mediates most human interaction, we think that a board game can give you good times with those you love (or, at least those you get along with reasonably well), just like a trip to Mackinac Island.A Game to Grow IntoThe five different games that come with MITH let you choose the experience you want based on the available players (2 to 8 people can play), the amount of time you have, or how much you want to think. While some of the games share common rules and themes (for example, each game features some sort of nature observation), each is a completely separate game. We designed the games to be challenging and fun and infinitely replayable. You can learn about the Island as you play, though they are not trivia games.We appreciate euro-game sensibilities, so these are games that require strategic thinking. Each turn you'll have several paths to take that may affect how the game progresses for you later.

Match Me if You Can is an Authors Cards-style set collection card game that can be fun for mixed age groups.


The Nature Hike is a roll-and-move game of nature observation. Each turn you have to find the path that will allow you to see the most plants, animals, and natural features (and score the most points).


The Scavenger Hunt is a cooperative game that has players planning together to find a set of hidden treasures before Winter arrives.


The Hide and Seek game tests your memory as each turn reveals the hiding place of a historical treasure on the Island for you to collect...if you can remember where it is.

The Treasure Hunt has you playing the sleuth, asking questions of the other players in order to discover the treasures they have hidden around the Island.
Inside the box is a game board, 126 playing cards, 24 hiding place cards, 8 pawns, 8 scoring markers, one season marker, 3 turn summary cards, one scoring track card, and a 24-page rule book and field guide.You Enable Michigan Made!MITH is completely designed and tested. See some of the play tester's comments here. The examples you see on this page were printed by a print-on-demand board game manufacturer which, while beautiful, come at a high price and from outside of Michigan. In order to get the cost to a reasonable level, we have to have MITH printed by a large volume game manufacturer. Luckily, one of the premiere game manufacturers in the World is located in Battle Creek, Michigan! We have chosen Delano Service to manufacture our game. To get to our price sweet spot we need to make about 2500 games. We're willing to fund some of this ourselves, but you can make MITH a reality by donating whatever you can. Please check out our great perks to guide your decision.Your donation will also allow us to sell MITH in stores and online, a portion of the proceeds from which will go to help Mackinac State Historic Parks preserve this wonderful place for coming generations.With a Michigan-based design team, a Michigan-based manufacturer, a Michigan-based fulfillment company, and your help, MITH will be a mostly Michigan-made product*.*The pawns and markers will be made in the USA.Design Team







MITH was designed by Jim Muratzki, who has been playing and designing board games for as long as he can remember.
The game includes over 90 photographs by Barbara Overdier, who has a knack for showing you things in a new way.
The primary artwork was done by Glenn Wolff, a Traverse City-based artist and teacher whose work has appeared in books by Janine Benyus and Jerry Dennis and in the New York Times, among many others.

Ralph Hashoian, artist, teacher, and cartoonist, provided the historical treasure illustrations.

All of the content was reviewed by the staff of Mackinac State Historic Parks and Patricia Martin, Island resident and naturalist (though any errors still belong to us!).Your TurnWithout your support, MITH won't happen. We're offering lots of great perks to make it easy for you to be a part of this great new way to experience the past and present Mackinac Island. Please participate at whatever level works for you, and we'll thank you.Let other Mackinac Island fans you know about MITH and think how good our gratitude will make you feel about yourself!See you on the Island! 









Supporters at The Beach Comber perk level will receive a set of Great Lakes pebbles and beach glass to bring the Mackinac Island karma to your game session when used as pawns and markers!

<div>

<li>$10 - Three month membership package</li>

<li>$100 - Skype date with Lyndon, the mastermind behind Land of Minecraft</li>
<li>$100 - Lifetime membership to all Land of Minecraft gaming servers</li>
</ul>
<div> </div>
<div>That's a lot of different options, and I'll walk you through each one.  The three month package is an incredible 66% discount off the usual price.  We have never offered lifetime membership packages before, and this may be your only opportunity to grab one.  Lifetime membership, at $100, is an absolute bargain!  I still can't believe we are offering it at such a low price.</div>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We are currently shooting videos for the new BrazenGaming YouTube channel.  We are going to be covering a wide range of topics ranging from RPG gaming to classics like Portal 2 and, of course, Minecraft.  The $30 package here gives you the opportunity to star in one episode and you get to pick which game!   Have an epic Minecraft build you want to show the world?  Always wanted to tackle a complicated Portal 2 co-op puzzle?  Think you have the chops to take one of us down in an epic battle?  This is your chance to capture it all for the world to see!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We are also currently building an entire new Minecraft server revolved around the RPG theme.  The $50 package gets you early access to the server, this fall, before anyone else gets to play.  You will be able to watch as we build the new arenas, towns, expansive road system, warps, games, markets, and tons of other classic RPG gaming features!  This new RPG server will have multiple chat channels and even support server-to-server chat to players in the survival server.  The mcMMO plugin and economies will also be linked between the servers!  You can build up your stats in survival and then come test your strength in one of the three PVP arenas.  Progress up through the tiers and compete at the highest level against players that know how to battle!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Currently, Land of Minecraft needs around $150 per month just to keep the lights on.  With the new expansions we have planned, we expect that number to quickly rise as we scale up the in-development servers for full production game play.  Land of Minecraft current expenses include:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Minecraft server hosting - 4 servers</li>
<li>Minecraft server security monitoring and log management</li>
<li>Enjin website hosting &amp; server shop</li>
<li>PayPal payment processing</li>
<li>Dreamhost website hosting</li>
<li>iOS app development and developer licensing</li>
</ul>
<div> </div>
<div>The time has come to take Land of Minecraft to the next level!  We are committed to giving our players a soon to be legendary RPG, survival, and FTB Minecraft experience.  We are relying on our players to help us fund this expansion and keep the doors open.  If the indiegogo fundraiser does not raise the necessary funds, we will definitely have to re-evaluate our plans for going forward, which will likely include the following cost reduction options:</div>
<div> </div>
</div>

<li>Shutting down one or more of the Minecraft servers</li>

The scenery of game sets in the Bermudas Isles. Build forts and buildings, and send your ships to lay siege to the enemy!The Scene of Somers Isles
In each Scene Level there will be at least eight types of ships, each with their own unique capabilities and strengths. 
 Two game modes: Strategy mode (tycoon) and Exploration mode (pirates).
Added a new game mode (Exploration) -- just sail around with a ship. - Added wave trails behind the ship in exploration mode. It's possible to place towns at runtime and then have the traders explore to find them and establish towns nearby.
Flexible combat system (attach any number of cannons on your ship, each with customized amount of damage, reload time, accuracy, etc).
Easily tweakable damage system (hull HP, sail HP, damage reduction, etc).
Visible damage via ship's sails.
Ship customization via built-in fake decal system using secondary texture coordinates.
Fully working trade route logic — establish, assign goods and ships… profit!
Weather Effects
Add new Ships, Props...
We have the intention of integrating cross platform (between iOS, Android, Mac, PC, Linux and OUYA) multi-player into the entire game. With all this in mind we have a very finite amount of resources to apply to the task at hand, but we feel that the end result will push the boundaries of the genre a little further and hopefully produce an amazing game.We are a independent game development studio from Taiwan.

<h2>About</h2>
<p>Galactical Maiden Ciel is a dungeon-based RPG with dating sim and strategy elements. Unlike other RPGs, Galactical Maiden Ciel features a rogue/thief-oriented dungeon which means that abilities such as stealth, detecting traps, opening locks, deciphering ancient runes, and diplomacy will play an important role in the game.</p>
<h2>Story</h2>
<p>In a desolate desert in the Middle East, a group of scientists uncover an ancient ruin of an alien civilization known as the Dogma Empire. As they enter the ruin, they find its inhabitants in suspended animation. It does not take long until they begin to awake from their slumber and unleash their terrible power on the unfortunate scientists and soon ... the world.</p>

<h2>Why Erobotan needs your help?</h2>
<p>So far it's only me working on the sprites, GUIs, and game codes. The funding will be used to commission artists for high quality music, story, background artworks for dialog scenes, sound effects and stuff. I'll finish this game no matter what, but your contribution is needed to give Galactical Maiden Ciel a profesional and polished look that it deserves.</p>
<p><strong>And for all yuri fans out there, the success of this campaign will make sure that more yuri games will come out from my humble workplace! </strong></p>
<p>Please help me spreads the words ^o^ !</p>
<h2>Game Rating</h2>
<p>I think the game will be rated as teen since it has violence, suggestive themes (no sex scenes though) and stuff. However, there is a chance that it will be rated as Mature because it features lesbian theme according to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Software_Rating_Board#Same-sex_relationships"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>Tavern Of Heroes is a game coming to Windows, OSX &amp; GNU/Linux made by Optim GameStudio. In this twist of the rpg genre, the player controls a complete party of heroes during their adventures. The goal of the game is to continually challenge the player through overwhelming numbers of enemies paired with the challenge of controlling multiple heroes.</p>
<p>The game is built in a way that content is generated dynamically and scales with the player's team. This ensures that it is possible to play with every character and experience their unique storyline while always being challenged by the game's difficulty.</p>
<p>This is our first major game and an attempt by us to enter the world of indie game development.</p>

<p>Optim GameStudio consists of 3 friends from Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The team includes 2 code monkeys (FrankBro and McBoul) and an artist (Dawnfury). The project started when I, FrankBro, a fresh electric engineering graduate, figured I'd rather make video games than do anything else. Before officially entering the job market, I figured I would give one last try at game development.</p>
<p>Since making a game is not a simple task, I asked one of my friends for help. McBoul, a soon-to-be automated production engineering graduate. We've known each others for a while and we were doing freelance application development for businesses so we're used to working together.</p>
<p>We also needed art for video games. Dawnfury is currently studying graphic design and we've known each other since kindergarden. It has been our dream since childhood to create video games and we're really excited with the prospect of doing that professionally.</p>
<p>Additionally, we've got a great artist that agreed to join us and do the music for our game! His name is KwazeKwaze and you can listen his music on <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/kwazekwaze"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://soundcloud.com/kwazekwaze</a></p>

The reason we're asking for your contribution is to make this project our priority. If we reach the goal, we will drop our part-time jobs and focus our minds on Tavern Of Heroes as our full-time job. That will make it possible to release the game faster to everyone. Also, the artist needs a proper chair.</p>

Tavern Of Heroes, a rpg where you control the whole party!
Tavern Of Heroes is a game coming to Windows, OSX & GNU/Linux made by Optim GameStudio. In this twist of the rpg genre, the player controls a complete party of heroes during their adventures. The goal of the game is to continually challenge the player through overwhelming numbers of enemies paired with the challenge of controlling multiple heroes.
The game is built in a way that content is generated dynamically and scales with the player's team. This ensures that it is possible to play with every character and experience their unique storyline while always being challenged by the game's difficulty.
This is our first major game and an attempt by us to enter the world of indie game development.




Tavern Of Heroes follows the story of a small tavern located in a kingdom ruled by might and magic. Many heroes from the surrounding regions enjoy the fine ales and the great atmosphere of the tavern. The fate of those heroes will be intertwined depending on your decisions. As these heroes form parties to further their goal, more of them will show up in the tavern. Here's a list of the features of the game:


Unique combat system: Interesting twist to the classic point-n-click RPG gameplay which proves to be both challenging and rewarding. 


Pair heroes together in unique team setup: The player decides his ideal team setup. Multiple teams can be built to overcome different obstacles and the game encourages that. Use different elements and types of skills to your advantage.


Time-based skills:  The player needs to manage the different skills if he wants to survive the onslaught of monsters. The game focuses on management of their timers rather than mashing them.


Explore the storyline of each hero: By completing the quests associated with each hero, you will obtain many rewards. Most importantly, you will be able to unlock it in your regular team setup and further improve its skills.


Evolve heroes the way you want: Each hero possesses it's own skill tree with different paths you can choose. These paths will influence the way the hero helps the team. There is no cookie-cutter path, rather ways to make heroes more useful in certain team setups.


Gear up your heroes: Dynamic item generation paired with epic items that are awarded through heroes' storyline progress offer many ways to improve your team.


Dynamic level generation: Each hero has different locations assigned to it. The quests are dynamically generated depending on several factors and scale with the team power.


No DRM, cross-platform: Since the game uses C++ and opengl, it is available for all the major platforms. We also want to offer the game as a single executable and bundled with game services such as desura and steam if possible in the future.





The game itself is still in its early alpha days. We wanted to create some scaffold before making an indiegogo to test the general feeling of the game. Many things need to be added to make it a full game. These features include :

<p>Hello, my name is Steven Carr of Trilucid Entertainment LLC. In 1989 I was given a Sega Genesis for my 19th birthday. After getting  past the initial excitement of having the console, I started telling myself that I wanted to make games. I had no clue how I was going to do it, when I was going to do it, or even where to find the right course to take to make this all happen. I am 51 now. I have 4 children, I lost my oldest son in July  of 2020. Throughout the last 25 years I worked on my dream little by little. Even though I never took up formal training to get into the industry, I have met great people along the way who inspired me to keep going. In 2003, A partner of mine and I went to game conference in Chicago. We were absolutely new to it. I was surprised that we were even allowed in the conference. ""Fight night"" was the headline game being discussed. I knew then I was on the right path to creating my own game.  At that time I was taking martial arts too. I felt that what I was learning in martial arts could possibly translate into an interesting game. ""Fight night"" in the presenters explanation made perfect sense to me. He and his staff took boxing lessons to present a ""true to life"" interpretation of what a boxing game should feel like and be. In short, I am working on creating a "" true to life"" version of a fighting game with a few unique twist. </p>
<p> In the creation of S.O.U.L. Heroes, We want to give the user the total experience in  designing your fight style/discipline, you can create yourself and earn belt rankings, fight against other players/factions and go through the main characters life journey to becoming a S.O.U.L.

The raining 30,000 will be used in Brand recognition, marketing, and S.O.U.L. swag.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Summary</strong></h2>
<p>In the world of Varr, magic was a major power, lauded yet feared by all. The leaders of the past once forbade the practice of sorcery and death sentence would befall those who dared to use it. The gods, enraged by such deed, decided to destroy their life by releasing a beast known as ""Magaran"".</p>
<p>The last few wizards managed to calm the gods and return Magaran to where it came from. They made a pact with the leaders of humans and the gods, which was to gather every single person bearing the potential of magic in order to teach them how to control their power, so that they would not rebel against the kings. Leodetable Institute was one of those. The existence of the institute was still appalling to commoners that they had to remain hidden while gathering their students.</p>
<p>Adri, a blind tailor who've lost his memories five years ago, found a strange letter behind his workshop. It detected him as a dangerous latent wizard. By seconds, The Hunters dragged him to a broken door of dimension and put him under custody. He was forced to become Leodetable Institute's student and to learn control his power in minimum four years study without any contact from outsider.</p>
<p>The characters which Adri could follow were four. Saputra was Adri's roommate who talked so much. They quarreled almost every day. The captain of O.S. (Organization of Student), Wood, seemed love to annoy Adri so much to the point Adri wished to never know him. Seal and Rafi were the main character's classmates with abuser-and-his-victim relationship.</p>
<p>As he live under its roof, Adri found out that the minister of this institute was planning to overthrow the kingdom. Seal wanted to counter-act that and invited Adri to be one of his member. At the same time, Di-On, a mysterious kid, told him to get out of there as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Will Adri stay or will he go? [ErdaEnos]</p>

<p>The plan is to develop ""Leodetable Institute"" in <strong>15 months time-frame</strong>. It will be finished around autumn, October 2018. The story has been through four years of careful planning and is ready to be implemented into the game.<strong> I will update the progress at least twice a month at <a href=""http://spoiler-leodetable-institute.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tumblr</a> and <a href=""http://www.patreon.com/erdaenos"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Patreon</a></strong>, so you can know precisely where is the development is going.</p>
<p>Most of my time is for the programming section because of the story branching and sub-consequences for your choices. This is my third project after a game-jam called ""Toilet Story"" (2015) and a short game called ""Immer Sie"" back in 2014 (2nd Winner of Game Concept Competition @ Telkom).</p>
<p>As years passed, I decided it is time to create what I have been planning, no matter what. The fund will mostly go to this project's development such as; pay the software extra codes/effects, pay the bills and making sure I have something to eat. It'll be a bit slow because I am going to work this side-by-side with my patreon and side jobs. I believe in trusting my guts and I know this will work.</p>
<p>Unexpected expenses are from my own bank account and will be strengthened  by 8% of the funding plan.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">How this works</h3>
<p>The finished game <strong>will be published in itch.io page</strong> around October 2018. The backers who have pledged ""Early Birds ~ Pla Magic User"", ""The Game ~ Pla Magic User"", ""Minister of Magic"" and ""Master of Magic"" will be given <strong>itch.io download keys.</strong> Simply make an itch.io account, click the Download Key's link, and claim ownership to prevent anyone else from using it. After claiming ownership, you will be directed to the download page for Mac/Windows.</p>
<p><u><i>What about steam? Are you going to put Leodetable Institute in Greenlight?</i></u></p>
<p>I will see how this project is going to be first. If there are many requests my project to be there after its launch, I will work it around!</p>

Genre: Fantasy
Rating: R-18

Engine: RPG Maker MV, Unity
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
A BL (Boys Love a.k.a. Male and Male romance story) visual novel with RPG attribute to play the world. Side scrolling map.

Summary
In the world of Varr, magic was a major power, lauded yet feared by all. The leaders of the past once forbade the practice of sorcery and death sentence would befall those who dared to use it. The gods, enraged by such deed, decided to destroy their life by releasing a beast known as ""Magaran"".
The last few wizards managed to calm the gods and return Magaran to where it came from. They made a pact with the leaders of humans and the gods, which was to gather every single person bearing the potential of magic in order to teach them how to control their power, so that they would not rebel against the kings. Leodetable Institute was one of those. The existence of the institute was still appalling to commoners that they had to remain hidden while gathering their students.
Adri, a blind tailor who've lost his memories five years ago, found a strange letter behind his workshop. It detected him as a dangerous latent wizard. By seconds, The Hunters dragged him to a broken door of dimension and put him under custody. He was forced to become Leodetable Institute's student and to learn control his power in minimum four years study without any contact from outsider.
The characters which Adri could follow were four. Saputra was Adri's roommate who talked so much. They quarreled almost every day. The captain of O.S. (Organization of Student), Wood, seemed love to annoy Adri so much to the point Adri wished to never know him. Seal and Rafi were the main character's classmates with abuser-and-his-victim relationship.
As he live under its roof, Adri found out that the minister of this institute was planning to overthrow the kingdom. Seal wanted to counter-act that and invited Adri to be one of his member. At the same time, Di-On, a mysterious kid, told him to get out of there as soon as possible.
Will Adri stay or will he go? [ErdaEnos]

<p>A futuristic motorcycle racing game with a twist. Create walls of crackling electricity behind you as you speed through levels at hundreds of miles per hour! Place your walls carefully, and drive strategically to ensure your opponent’s demise; time your jumps, and avoid crashing into walls to prevent your own. With up to four players bent on destroying you on the map at a given time, the competition gets fierce.</p>
<p>Gameplay!</p>
<p>You play the role of a high speed motorcyclist, pitted in a fight to the death against others like you. You are given motorcycles with the ability to create walls behind them, as well as brake and boost. The single objective: Survive</p>
<p>Featuring a rich single player and a vast multiplayer with infinite replay-ability, whether staring down your own computer or settling the score with your friends, the action is guaranteed to be fast and intense!</p>
<p>Graphics!</p>
<p>Turn beautiful curves in a multicolored true-3d landscape.  Rising and falling with the level, your bike carves walls of energy into the ground. Nothing better captures the feeling of racing in and around these battles than pictures, and so we will let them do the talking.</p>
<p>Features!</p>
<p>High speed, physics based racing.</p>
<p>Battles with walls that can be turned on and off, and disappear behind you after having lived their lives.</p>
<p>Variable steering, and the ability to jump over any walls in your way.</p>

<p>10 Different Stages already!</p>
<p>Fast paced multiplayer!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Funds!</p>
<p>Although much of the game has been developed already, there still remains much to be done. The funds we are seeking are slated to be used to purchase assets that we have been unable to produce ourselves: such as more music, higher quality art, and graphically improved levels.</p>
<p>The remaining funds will be put towards developing more levels, as well as adding in a control customization option! Other possible additions to the game include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A genuine story mode! The story is all written, but not yet included.</li>
<li>Multiple bike models to choose from.</li>
<li>Gamepad support.</li>
<li>In-game video capture support!</li>
</ul><p>We are also open to suggestions from our fans! If you love or hate any of these ideas, or those not listed, let us know! We want this game to be amazing FOR YOU!</p>
<p>Distribution!</p>
<p>Right now the game is only being released for PC and Mac as a downloadable client. The download is currently hosted on my site during the open beta, though partnering with steam or another similar program is not out of the realm of possibilities once the game is released.</p>
<p>One of the goals of this game, is should we have enough funds, to port ELECTRON to the iOS and Android market! That way everyone can also play it on the go! The mental image of a kid on the subway, tilt-steering their cycle, as it races past an opponent – it’s the dream.</p>

Electron!
A futuristic motorcycle racing game with a twist. Create walls of crackling electricity behind you as you speed through levels at hundreds of miles per hour! Place your walls carefully, and drive strategically to ensure your opponent’s demise; time your jumps, and avoid crashing into walls to prevent your own. With up to four players bent on destroying you on the map at a given time, the competition gets fierce.
Gameplay!
You play the role of a high speed motorcyclist, pitted in a fight to the death against others like you. You are given motorcycles with the ability to create walls behind them, as well as brake and boost. The single objective: Survive
Featuring a rich single player and a vast multiplayer with infinite replay-ability, whether staring down your own computer or settling the score with your friends, the action is guaranteed to be fast and intense!
Graphics!
Turn beautiful curves in a multicolored true-3d landscape.  Rising and falling with the level, your bike carves walls of energy into the ground. Nothing better captures the feeling of racing in and around these battles than pictures, and so we will let them do the talking.
Features!
High speed, physics based racing.
Battles with walls that can be turned on and off, and disappear behind you after having lived their lives.
Variable steering, and the ability to jump over any walls in your way.
Smart AI, programmed to seek you out, and destroy everything in their way.
Custom Colors!
10 Different Stages already!
Fast paced multiplayer!
 
 
Funds!
Although much of the game has been developed already, there still remains much to be done. The funds we are seeking are slated to be used to purchase assets that we have been unable to produce ourselves: such as more music, higher quality art, and graphically improved levels.
The remaining funds will be put towards developing more levels, as well as adding in a control customization option! Other possible additions to the game include:

A genuine story mode! The story is all written, but not yet included.
Multiple bike models to choose from.
Gamepad support.
In-game video capture support!
We are also open to suggestions from our fans! If you love or hate any of these ideas, or those not listed, let us know! We want this game to be amazing FOR YOU!
Distribution!
Right now the game is only being released for PC and Mac as a downloadable client. The download is currently hosted on my site during the open beta, though partnering with steam or another similar program is not out of the realm of possibilities once the game is released.
One of the goals of this game, is should we have enough funds, to port ELECTRON to the iOS and Android market! That way everyone can also play it on the go! The mental image of a kid on the subway, tilt-steering their cycle, as it races past an opponent – it’s the dream.

For the first time in my life I've decided that I want to host a tournament, combining the best people I can invite from America, Europe and Korea with the top 8 warriors from the North American ladder.</p><p>The first (and hopefully not the last...) tournament I host will be known as ""Destiny I"".</p> <p></p> <p> </p><h3>Funding goals/distribution</h3> <p>My budget for this tournament is $5,000.</p><p></p><ul>
<li>$200 will go towards the Korean/English bilingual admin I have chosen. He'll be responsible for doing vetos/setting up games and doing post game/post group interviews, if we decide to do them.</li>
<li>$200 will go towards art work from the artist. This includes branding/logo, slides between games, and overlays for in game.</li>

For the first time in my life I've decided that I want to host a tournament, combining the best people I can invite from America, Europe and Korea with the top 8 warriors from the North American ladder.The first (and hopefully not the last...) tournament I host will be known as ""Destiny I"".   Funding goals/distribution My budget for this tournament is $5,000.
$200 will go towards the Korean/English bilingual admin I have chosen. He'll be responsible for doing vetos/setting up games and doing post game/post group interviews, if we decide to do them.
$200 will go towards art work from the artist. This includes branding/logo, slides between games, and overlays for in game.
$600 will go towards casters. I will be paying each invited caster $100 for casting 1 day, meaning I will need 6 different casters for the tournament. If I'm not able to find 6, I'll repeat some casters. So far I've confirmed Incontrol, ToD, Nathanias and Minigun as casters.
$500 goes towards Indiegogo fees for fundraising.
$4000 will go towards the prize pool. The distribution will be as follows: 1st place $1,600, 2nd place $800, 3rd-4th place $400, 5th-8th place $200.
Extra money raised from the Indiegogo will be put towards future tournaments (Destiny II).
Tournament FormatI will be drafting 8 players from the top of the North American ladder. In order to qualify from there, the following conditions must be met -
You must be playing on an account who's name reflects the person playing it (no barcodes!)
You must be the only person laddering on the account.
You can't hack, cheat, boost, trade wins or commit any other obviously silly shenanigans.
The qualification period for the ladder will end on Sunday, August 3rd, 23:59 EST. At that point I will take the top 8, non-barcoded accounts and invite them to the tournament.
The other 8 players will be invited in. I'll announce the invites as I confirm them.The tournament will function as follows: the 8 people drafted from the ladder and the 8 invitees will be shuffled into 4 groups of 4 with 2 people from each category being in each group. Each of the groups will play 6 matches (plus a possible sudden death match, if needed) to determine who moves on. Once the 8 group stage survivors have been determined, they will feed into an 8 player bracket where bo5's will be played for quarter finals, then bo7's for semi-finals and a bo9 for the grind final to determine the winner. There will be no 3rd-4th place match.The group matches will take place one group per day, starting on August 5th and ending on August 8th. The quarter final bracket will start on August 9th, with the semi-finals and grand finals being played on Sunday, August 10th.All games will start at 10 AM EST (okay time for Americans, perfect time for Europeans, okay time for Koreans) and will probably carry on until about 2-3PM EST, though we'll try to move as briskly as possible.Future goals If this tournament is successful, I'd like to take what I learn from this and carry it forward into another tournament. Future tournaments may have more interesting or fun themes, but for now I'd like to keep things basic and just display amazing games with great casters and top-tier players.Following this tournament I'll provide a detailed write-up of viewership stats and how much money I was able to generate via sponsorships/ad revenue/etc...in a similar fashion to Totalbiscuit's Shoutcraft ""post-mortem"" reports to give people a better idea about how the procurement and expenditure of said funding works in tournaments like these.  Can't donate? If you're not able to contribute financially, there are still ways you can help! There are plenty of great resources available in both your school and online that will assist you in searching for a place of employment so you can collect and subsequently donate your first paycheck to me.In lieu of that, you can follow me on twitter for updates @steven_bonnell.

<p>On a recent vacation, my wife, Ann, and her friend, Judi, noticed numerous different specialty tags on cars roaming Florida’s roads and parking lots. They saw so many different license plate styles that they had a contest to see who could spot the largest number of them adorning automobiles. To make the contest more interesting, Ann and Judi wagered a dinner at a fine restaurant for the one who spotted a certain obscure plate (that shall remain nameless) first.</p>
<p>Being the geek that I am, I constructed an actual game book for them and others to use in playing the game and printed prototype copies on a color laser printer. I gave copies to families with children who were visiting Florida and to retirees who live or winter there. Their response was so positive that I’ve decided to make the game available to the public, but that requires making an expensive print run of at least 1,000 books.</p>
<p>This campaign is to raise money to pay part of the cost of the print run. All contributors will receive actual copies of the game; larger contributors get more copies. My hope is that contributors find it in their hearts to each give away one copy to someone they think will enjoy playing the game.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Indiegogo’s smallest campaign is for $500, an amount that would definitely get this project off the ground. The more that is contributed, the more copies can be printed. What you get out of this beside the satisfaction of helping launch this educational game is acquiring copies of the game at much less than retail price because there is no middle man. Also, shipping expenses cost proportionately less when more games are in the shipment. We will have games printed and sent to contributors regardless of how successful the campaign is. If unsuccessful, we will just have fewer printed. There is no risk on your part; you are guaranteed to receive games if you contribute.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Children need interesting activities to occupy them on long drives. Adults and children alike enjoy spotting license plates on parked cars when they go walking. Once a particular tag is spotted, the spotter can look it up on the Internet to learn more about the organization or cause. I have learned about organizations I didn’t previously know existed.</p>
<p>Your contribution will help make this game available for others. We’ve set the perk levels low to be affordable for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>If you’re not interested in playing the game or giving copies to friends, children, or grandchildren, you can support the project by telling others who might be interested about it. Indiegogo provides share tools to help to help spread the word on campaigns you find interesting. Direct people to this campaign by sending them its shortlink: igg.me/at/FLPG.</p></div>","Short Summary
