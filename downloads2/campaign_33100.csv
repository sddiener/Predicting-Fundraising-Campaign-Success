<h3>The Answers Recovery Program</h3>
<p>The ANSWERS Recovery Program®  (The Program) will recruit families of children with autism, ADHD, asthma, allergies, chronic Lyme, environmental illness or other chronic illnesses and provide them with FREE professional healing services and support in an effort to help each child attain optimal health.  By demonstrating that children can recover from these conditions, The Program hopes to change the current paradigm through which we view chronic disease in America. </p>
<p>The ultimate goal of The Program is to help families in their quest to achieve the greatest health potential for their children while documenting the successes and challenges of children as they recover.  We will be making a documentary film of this project in collaboration with Mary Mazzio, of 50 Eggs Productions.  The film will serve as an inspiration for families looking for answers for their children, but also as an expose on the environmental factors contributing to the epidemics of autism, ADHD, allergies and other conditions.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need Today &amp; Why:</h3>
<p>We need the initial $50,000 so we can get the program up and running.  Additional funds will be needed to complete the documentary film project, but initial $50,000 will pay for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Project website and outreach materials to garner sponsorships from important healthcare partners including diagnostics, supplement, holistic health, green cleaning, and organic food and personal care products (these donations/sponsorships of products/services will be given directly to the participating families)</li>
<li>Administrative costs to recruit families and prepare them for the program</li>
<li>Legal and administrative costs necessary to set up the program</li>
<li>Additional fundraising events so that we can raise more money to support as many as 10 children.</li>
<li>Books and educational materials (on health and wellness) for the participating families</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, we are Step by Step Foundation, a non-profit organization, and we need your help. As many of you have heard in the news, there have been ongoing fires in the Colorado area. Thousands of families have been forced to leave their homes, leaving everything they have behind.</p>
<p>At Step by Step Foundation, our mission is to enhance the lives of underprivileged children by creating and supporting, health, nutrition, water, education and other programs that substantially impact the human rights and development of children worldwide. Thus, we have made an alliance with Colorado Horse Park Foundation to help us with this campaign.</p>
<p>The campaign seeks to provide children with school backpacks that we have filled with school supplies (such as pencils, paper, rulers, erasers, pencil sharpeners, notebooks, among others) and distribute them to children who have lost everything. This will not only ensure that they have the supplies necessary to go to school, but it will also restore the feeling of owning something that is their own.</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>For every $25 you give us, a child receives a backpack with school supplies, and you recieve a Step by Step Foundation wristband.</p>
<p>For every $50 or more that you give us, 2+ children recieve backpacks with school supplies, and you recieve a Step by Step Foundation wristband and a Step by Step Foundation Medal.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We will reach as many children as the amount of our donations will allow us.</p>

I was hoping to donate one myself, until I realized the cost is beyond my means. It is important to get the proper PC
Donate, even just one dollar. It is less dissappointing to have everyone donating a dollar...than everyone not donating at all. That is how this works!!! Everyone who reads my campaign only needs to donate a small amount.   What We Need & What You Get I would need $5077 for a Twin Childhood Computer Set with Preschool activities and the remaining funds for accessories and desk to accomidate the computer and its additional accessories, keyboard etc...
iStartSmart is a kid-friendly preschool computer, preloaded with early childhood software that scaffolds learning. It monitors child progress as children play, showing administrators and teachers exactly what each child knows, so they can make informed decisions about small and large group instruction.
All of the money I receive in donations will go directly to the students.


The Impact 
Build School Readiness Skills

Fully engaged learning means results
Pinpoint exactly what each child knows
Scaffolded levels in 18 core skill areas
Progress data compiled at the individual, class, organization & district level

“The children can do everything themselves and with the random nature of the activities,they don’t get bored with this preschool computer!”


Risks & Challenges I hope the biggest challenge will be which preschool computer to choose from!

<p>I'd like to pitch an awesome gift for an amazing kid and his wonderful 
mother.  The child's name is Nicholas, I used to date his mother, 
Casey.  At some point Casey and I went our separate ways, but afterward,
 she met the man who took her life.  <br/></p>
<p>As a criminal justice major, I can’t help but learn about different disadvantages people face, nearly all since birth, and how they
affect a person’s entire life.  Some disadvantages form inescapable categories.<br/></p>
<p><i>Children without parents </i>is
one of those categories.</p>
<p>And who knows what troubles the future has lined up to multiply with yet more troubles because let's face it, reality either gets better or worse.  <br/></p>
<p>What's worse, one day he could google how his mother died, and he will have every justification not to care about anything he does.  </p>And that's the crux of the problem.  So to this collection of crappy circumstances, we must give a collective ""Nope.""<br/><br/>There is one factor very likely to increase his odds of a better life; that factor is education.  <br/><br/>That education must come in the form of a bachelor's degree.  <br/>
<p><br/></p>
<p>So here I am, I'm crowd funding Nicholas a college education.  <br/>
</p>
<p>And that's where you come in...<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What I'm Asking<br/>
</h3>I've set the bar at 30,000, the cost of a basic college education.  <br/><br/>But this isn't all he would be getting. He'd get people backing him.  People rooting for him and his potential!  <br/>Bottom-line: this kid is too cool to be defined by his circumstances, we want him to be his best in spite of them.<br/><br/>In addition to the college fund, I want to create a booklet full of encouraging messages from contributors, or anyone.  How outstanding would it be if he could read your message on a tough day somewhere down the line? <br/><br/>So please, email a brief message of encouragement.  </div><div>bagonzalez@spartan.northampton.edu<br/>Jscalercio@spartan.northampton.edu<br/><br/>

<h3>The Impact <br/>
</h3>Your contribution might mean a totally different course in one human being's life.  This added opportunity could transform his life.  It could give him the means to be awesome when he is ready to be awesome.  <br/><br/><p>Just because we live in a first-world country, doesn't mean everyone 
in it has a first-world life.  Nicholas lost what is irreplaceable; his mother's support throughout his life.  We cannot remedy that, but we can take it upon ourselves to ensure he has the means to better himself through education.  In ten years Nicholas will be a man, and I want him to have the 
opportunity to learn, and pursue a career of his choice later in life, 
to help balance the loss he has taken early in life.<br/></p>

<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
I am undaunted by risks and challenges!  <br/>
<p>Even though the greatest challenge lies within our country itself.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We’ve all heard people being skeptical of higher education.  We’ve heard stories from a friend of a
friend saying, “Mike’s got his masters but he still can’t find a job, now he has to pan for gold in the river or some ridiculous job"".<br/></p>
<p>Has the time come to ditch education, and
invest our energy on social media alone to become a professional twerker in
the competitive world of <i>give me
attention</i>? Does being intelligent mean lowering your expectations?  <br/></p>
<p>No!  We just better information.  <br/></p>
<p>Those starting at the lowest 20% of earners, (The poor) who never complete high school roughly have a 50%
chance of being poor.  Forever.
</p>
<p>That's like flipping a coin, and dealing with the result your entire life.<br/></p>
<p>However, those with a bachelor’s degree gain an 84% chance of ditching poverty.  <br/></p>
<p>And 20% of that 84% find their way to the top 20% of earners.  Awesome.<br/></p>

<p>So why then, if the numbers state education's value so definitely, is there so much controversy?  Why is there reason to think otherwise?</p>
<p>Simply stated, our system is very sick.  The United States is no longer very socially
mobile, and that is the challenge of all challenges.  Of all the top earners in our country, 70% of them were born that way, just the way the poor are born poor.  And some intelligent people say, because of this, the United States is no longer the 'republic' it once was, it is now something called an 'oligarchy.'  Which sucks.  And its on us.<br/></p>
<p>In the face of ugly realities, lets not lower
our ambitions  or our attention span.  Got to find real ways to work hard.  Ditching education may seem right, but the truth is we need to aspire to better types of education.  <br/></p>

Apart Förlag 
Apart Förlag ger ut livsviktig litteratur som The Walking Dead, A Game of Thrones och Sherlock Holmes på svenska och samlar den svenska tecknareliten i titlar som Ordningen upprätthålls alltid – det vill säga böcker de själva vill läsa men som inte gick att få tag på. Tidigare i höstas gav de ut ”en bilderbok från helvetet”* där läsaren får följa en SS-dolk från trettiotalets Berlin till tvåtusentalets Borås. 
Genom århundradet kommer den att ägas av bland annat black 
metal-musiker, samlare, ockultister och en försupen brevbärare. Boken, som är skriven av Pär Thörn och illustrerad av  skräcktecknaren Lars Krantz, kunde ges ut efter en lyckad crowdfunding här på indiegogo.

<p>Job seekers can set up an account and apply to jobs.  Plus jobs are highlighted in different colors to signify if they are part-time, full-time, volunteer, etc.  This helps students sift through the jobs faster while still giving the local employers a one stop shop for their needs.</p>
<p>Job Ninja provides a unique place for full-time students to find part-time jobs.  It also levels the playing field for independent businesses who want to add online resume collection to their hiring process.</p>

<h1><span>Summary</span></h1>
<p>Crayon Box Labs is a group of students from around the Bay Area in California. We have two apps on the market, and we’ve won Best in State for the 2012 Verizon Innovative App Challenge. Our main interest is making apps and games, and our dream is to become a videogame company.</p>
<br/><p>We want to attend a 48 hour long programming competition (called a ‘hackathon’) at Princeton University in New Jersey. Attending this competition will be pivotal moment in our little company, and it’ll bring us closer to making awesome games for the world to enjoy! Our overall goal is $4,000 to cover the travel expenses for the entire group, as well as to buy equipment (such as microcontrollers and breakout boards) for use during the competition as well as future app development. </p>
<br/>Your help will be a huge role in our journey. Ready to help an aspiring, entrepreneurial group of young tech-savvy students reach their dreams? To show our gratitude, we have an array of perks and gifts to offer back to all those who support us. <p> </p>

<h1><span>Who we are: Crayon Box Labs</span></h1>
<br/><p>We are Crayon Box Labs, a group of graphic artists, programmers, musicians and writers dedicated to creating novel and entertaining apps. We’re a family comprised of high school students with a few of college freshmen. </p>
<p><a href=""http://www.crayonboxlabs.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.crayonboxlabs.com/</a></p>
<br/><p>I am the President and one of the original founders of this humble organization. My name is Ahsan Zahid. I’ve had a deep connection and love for computers since I was little. I started programming at 11, and I got my first professional Cisco Certification at age 13, another at 14, and a third at 17.</p>
<br/><p>Here’s an article that talks a little bit more about who I am and my aspirations as a leader and techie:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.mercurynews.com/milpitas/ci_14420333"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.mercurynews.com/milpitas/ci_14420333</a><br/><a href=""http://sidengo.com/ahsanzahid"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">http://sidengo.com/ahsanzahid</a></p>
<br/><p>Our company’s humble origins started with me and two friends just hanging out in the biology classroom of our high school. Our little group soon grew and we all began to realize that we wanted to turn our thoughts and ideas into reality.We also realized our diverse and individual backgrounds had all the makings of a potential start-up. Soon little pet projects turned into full-fledged apps and here we are now. </p>

<h3></h3>
<h1><span>What we do: Make games and apps!</span></h1>
<p>We call ourselves Crayon Box Labs! Our team as of now is comprised of 12 people, each handling multiple roles, covering programming, graphics, music, storywriting, character design, level design, voiceovers, public relations, and marketing. </p>
<br/><p>Together, we launched our first two apps to the Google Play Store and the SlideMe Market:<br/><span><a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Crayon+Box+Labs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Crayon+Box+Labs</a><br/></span><a href=""http://slideme.org/user/zerova0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">http://slideme.org/user/zerova0</a></p>
<br/><p>`They have, collectively across markets, over 4,000 downloads. In 2012, we entered the Verizon Innovative App Challenge, a mobile application design competition, and won Best in State in California for our concept of a school navigation app.</p>
<br/>Our dream is to someday start an actual video game company, working together to make awesome games for a variety of platforms. To get there though, we’re trying to gain experience by working on projects and actually making things!<p></p>

<h1><span>What we need: YOUR support at HackPrinceton</span></h1>
<p>‘Hackathons’, a combination of ‘hack’ and ‘marathon’, is exactly what it sounds like: a hacking marathon! This is where teams of coders, designers, artists, and engineers come together and within a specific time limit, they work on creating a new app, a new game, a new software… The possibilities are endless! At the end of the designing and hacking frenzy, each team demos its project, and prizes are awarded. </p>
<p>One such renowned competition is HackPrinceton, which will take place at Princeton University, on the weekend of November 8. </p>
<p>We have the determination and the drive to get there but unfortunately, we lack the funds. For us to be able to get there and represent the good Bay Area name in tech development, we need more help.

Crayon Box Labs is a group of students from around the Bay Area in California. We have two apps on the market, and we’ve won Best in State for the 2012 Verizon Innovative App Challenge. Our main interest is making apps and games, and our dream is to become a videogame company.
We want to attend a 48 hour long programming competition (called a ‘hackathon’) at Princeton University in New Jersey. Attending this competition will be pivotal moment in our little company, and it’ll bring us closer to making awesome games for the world to enjoy! Our overall goal is $4,000 to cover the travel expenses for the entire group, as well as to buy equipment (such as microcontrollers and breakout boards) for use during the competition as well as future app development. 
Your help will be a huge role in our journey. Ready to help an aspiring, entrepreneurial group of young tech-savvy students reach their dreams? To show our gratitude, we have an array of perks and gifts to offer back to all those who support us.  








Who we are: Crayon Box Labs
We are Crayon Box Labs, a group of graphic artists, programmers, musicians and writers dedicated to creating novel and entertaining apps. We’re a family comprised of high school students with a few of college freshmen. 
http://www.crayonboxlabs.com/
I am the President and one of the original founders of this humble organization. My name is Ahsan Zahid. I’ve had a deep connection and love for computers since I was little. I started programming at 11, and I got my first professional Cisco Certification at age 13, another at 14, and a third at 17.
Here’s an article that talks a little bit more about who I am and my aspirations as a leader and techie:
http://www.mercurynews.com/milpitas/ci_14420333http://sidengo.com/ahsanzahid
Our company’s humble origins started with me and two friends just hanging out in the biology classroom of our high school. Our little group soon grew and we all began to realize that we wanted to turn our thoughts and ideas into reality.We also realized our diverse and individual backgrounds had all the makings of a potential start-up. Soon little pet projects turned into full-fledged apps and here we are now. 



What we do: Make games and apps!
We call ourselves Crayon Box Labs! Our team as of now is comprised of 12 people, each handling multiple roles, covering programming, graphics, music, storywriting, character design, level design, voiceovers, public relations, and marketing. 
Together, we launched our first two apps to the Google Play Store and the SlideMe Market:https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Crayon+Box+Labshttp://slideme.org/user/zerova0
`They have, collectively across markets, over 4,000 downloads. In 2012, we entered the Verizon Innovative App Challenge, a mobile application design competition, and won Best in State in California for our concept of a school navigation app.
Our dream is to someday start an actual video game company, working together to make awesome games for a variety of platforms. To get there though, we’re trying to gain experience by working on projects and actually making things!




What we need: YOUR support at HackPrinceton
‘Hackathons’, a combination of ‘hack’ and ‘marathon’, is exactly what it sounds like: a hacking marathon! This is where teams of coders, designers, artists, and engineers come together and within a specific time limit, they work on creating a new app, a new game, a new software… The possibilities are endless! At the end of the designing and hacking frenzy, each team demos its project, and prizes are awarded. 
One such renowned competition is HackPrinceton, which will take place at Princeton University, on the weekend of November 8. 
We have the determination and the drive to get there but unfortunately, we lack the funds. For us to be able to get there and represent the good Bay Area name in tech development, we need more help. We’re all students, and we need you to help us in regards to travel expenses and equipment expenses. Our overall goal is $4,000 to cover the flight tickets from California to New Jersey as well as some software and hardware we need for the competition. 

The Impact:All of the technology and modern conveniences we enjoy now such as our smartphones even down to the innovative and helpful little apps all started somewhere.

</p>
<p><a href=""www.infusionarts.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Infusionarts</a> is
a UK based organisation run by Shirley Beth Newbery. Infusionarts works in both
the UK, Africa and most recently America. It runs community based arts courses,
workshops and film projects. In Africa Shirley Beth raises money for micro
projects, and individuals in need. Her small but trusted network of contacts
there ensures that her not-for-profit activities make a significant difference
for those she helps. In 2009 for example infusionarts raised the $800 needed to
pay for an operation for a Maasai lady with a large goiter condition. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/161478/files/20131029080641-Goiter_lady_before_SIDE_VIEW_.jpg?1383059201"" src="""" style=""width: 129px; height: 86px;""/>              </p>

<p></p>The
operation led to a full recovery and her reintegration into her community.
Looking forward to 2014, infusionarts is raising money to fund schooling for
six children in Northern Tanzania. Three at primary level, and three at
secondary level. This will significantly enhance the lives of those six
children and their families, and increase their chances of further education
and a hopeful future. A future in which educated young people in Africa see their
developing countries grow stronger, becoming self-sufficient and prosperous.<p></p>
<p>""I have been to
villages in Tanzania many times and I have met families where schooling has
been introduced. Many families live at a subsistence level and cannot afford
the fees or school uniform, even though they are very low by Western standards.
The hope for the family's future seems to shine brighter when their children
are attending school. The children I have met are keen to learn and would take pride
in their place at a school"". Your money will help these children and their
families by giving them hope for a brighter future. Some may be attending
school for the first time,others may need help to continue with their
education, with the hope of eventually going on to college or university and a
career.</p>
<p>Imagine having to
tell your own children that they will have to stay at home because you cannot
afford to send them to school. With small campaigns like this we can make a
huge difference to the lives of some children!      </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get.</h3>
<p></p>
<p>For this project
we need to raise £6,000. No longer is our wonderful artist in need of funds, a great friend has provided that and arranged it already, ! yeah! So why send an artist to climb a mountain? Well, its simply to help
raise more money ! Gregory Wellman, currently featured on Sky Arts Portrait Artist of the year Award, is <b>climbing Kilimanjaro in February 2014</b> to help gain interest and increased publicity for this great project. Individuals get a chance to own a great piece of art ,a Signed Limited Print by Gregory. <b>Businesses and individuals can have their company
logo shown on top the highest free standing mountain in the world for a much
appreciated $1000!</b></p>
<p>You get a photo
and update on the children being sponsored, and can request further information
throughout the year.</p>
<p>Due to
infusionarts African contacts we can keep costs low. What ever we get will pay for these children so if we don't reach the goal, all will go to them and you will be sent confirmation on those fortunate ones to have been given this opportunity.</p>
<p>All money raised will now go to the children. The climb has been sorted thanks to a wonderful company we have links with!  So <strike>Approx costs: Kilimanjaro
climb $2,000. (includes all operator and National Park Fees)  </strike></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Flight approx $1,000. (I will pay for all guide and porter tips,
and all other of my trip and all other expenses) All money from above goes to the kids in need! yeah... that means we can now give to more . thank you, thank you, thank you! </p>
<p><b>Each disadvantaged child from the
camp Moses site costs $50 per month for shelther, food and schooling, and yes
thats $600 per year. </b></p>
<p><b>To support a Maasai child's schooling is just $400 per year. We want enough
for six children to benefit. If possible- the more the better! That is our goal for 2014.</b></p>

<p><em><strong>Our friend is a senior disabled single woman being harassed, bullied and sued by her HOA (Home Owners Association).</strong></em></p>
<p><em>We desperately need some help to put a stop to this discriminating situation.</em> </p>
<p>Since recently moving out to her 5-acre property in the Country, to enjoy her retirement while fishing and enjoying nature, <em>she is being harassed, bullied and sued by her HOA,</em> for installing three outdoor security lights on her horseshoe shaped driveway on her corner property.  These lights do not shine onto the community/public roads or onto other properties!  Two of the lights were installed by the electric company and are 23’ and 26’ high with Int'l. dark sky compliant with 250w illumination with amber bulbs and the third light is on a 17’ pole with a dusk to dawn 65w bulb, that shines downwards.</p>
<p>Let me share a little about my friend, so you will know how she got into this predicament. Four and half years ago, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. After the chemotherapy and the radiation treatments she returned to work and was laid off. She has always prided herself in working hard to make a living, but the cancer took its toll. <em>We are blessed that she survived the disease and the treatments, yet unfortunately, she is not the same person physically.</em> She sold her home in the city, so she could move to the country, to live out her retirement on her disability income and do what she enjoys doing most: fishing, being outdoors and watching wildlife, especially feeding the deer on her property.</p>
<p>She has a modest home on 5-acres and installed outdoor lighting for her safety, security and enjoyment of the wildlife. Three months after moving into her country home, her HOA advised her that she was in violation of the deed restrictions over the outdoor lighting. However, <em>none of us</em> could find one restriction addressing outdoor lighting. She has asked repeatedly for the HOA to tell her what article in the deed restrictions addresses outdoor lighting. They could not answer her question and quickly scolded her like a child, saying the Board had decided that she had enough lights and promptly dismissed her. <em>She has tried on several occasions to resolve this matter unsuccessfully.</em> Not being able to tie her outdoor lighting to any other restriction, the HOA decided to use the nuisance article, thereby declaring it a nuisance and filed a temporary injunction against her. At that hearing she did not have legal counsel and the HOA won. <em>Now, the HOA has filed for a permanent injunction,</em> wanting her to turn off these three lights and stating that anyone who should ever own this property, (including herself, her heirs, friends, family and associates) could never have this outdoor lights. <em>They want her her live in total darkness and they are now suing her for their legal fees and to get this temporary injunction made into a permanent ruling.</em> Instead of living out the rest of her life doing the simple things on her country property, <strong>she is fighting for her rights against being harassed, abused, bullied and sued by her HOA.</strong>  She does not deserve this treatment.  She is a wonderful, kind and caring woman that is <em><strong>always</strong> </em>helping others.</p>
<p><em>I am asking you to help her hire an HOA attorney.</em>  She is not a lawyer and cannot represent herself.  Since she lives on a fixed income, the only way for her to pursue this legal route and stop this harassment and bullying tactics from the HOA, is to hire an attorney to represent her.  We have been advised it could cost in the neighborhood of $35,000.00 - $50,000.00 to fight this. She has exhausted all of her menial savings and now her family, friends and neighbors, have started a fund to enable her to put a stop to this harassment, bullying and abuse.  To date, we have raised $2100.00 and yet <em>we need so much more</em>!</p>
<p><em><strong>PLEASE</strong></em> contribute to this campaign. Help us spread the word and <em>refer your friends, family and co-workers to this web site</em>.  <strong>She needs all of our help</strong> so she can live out her life in peace.  By helping her, we can <em><strong>stop this HOA from bullying and abusing other senior disabled single women</strong></em> and the many other people being abused by their HOA’s.  THANK YOU.</p>

After the chemotherapy and the radiation treatments she returned to work and was laid off. She has always prided herself in working hard to make a living, but the cancer took its toll. We are blessed that she survived the disease and the treatments, yet unfortunately, she is not the same person physically. She sold her home in the city, so she could move to the country, to live out her retirement on her disability income and do what she enjoys doing most: fishing, being outdoors and watching wildlife, especially feeding the deer on her property.
She has a modest home on 5-acres and installed outdoor lighting for her safety, security and enjoyment of the wildlife. Three months after moving into her country home, her HOA advised her that she was in violation of the deed restrictions over the outdoor lighting. However, none of us could find one restriction addressing outdoor lighting. She has asked repeatedly for the HOA to tell her what article in the deed restrictions addresses outdoor lighting. They could not answer her question and quickly scolded her like a child, saying the Board had decided that she had enough lights and promptly dismissed her. She has tried on several occasions to resolve this matter unsuccessfully. Not being able to tie her outdoor lighting to any other restriction, the HOA decided to use the nuisance article, thereby declaring it a nuisance and filed a temporary injunction against her. At that hearing she did not have legal counsel and the HOA won. Now, the HOA has filed for a permanent injunction, wanting her to turn off these three lights and stating that anyone who should ever own this property, (including herself, her heirs, friends, family and associates) could never have this outdoor lights. They want her her live in total darkness and they are now suing her for their legal fees and to get this temporary injunction made into a permanent ruling. Instead of living out the rest of her life doing the simple things on her country property, she is fighting for her rights against being harassed, abused, bullied and sued by her HOA.  She does not deserve this treatment.  She is a wonderful, kind and caring woman that is always helping others.
I am asking you to help her hire an HOA attorney.  She is not a lawyer and cannot represent herself.  Since she lives on a fixed income, the only way for her to pursue this legal route and stop this harassment and bullying tactics from the HOA, is to hire an attorney to represent her.  We have been advised it could cost in the neighborhood of $35,000.00 - $50,000.00 to fight this. She has exhausted all of her menial savings and now her family, friends and neighbors, have started a fund to enable her to put a stop to this harassment, bullying and abuse.  To date, we have raised $2100.00 and yet we need so much more!
PLEASE contribute to this campaign. Help us spread the word and refer your friends, family and co-workers to this web site.  She needs all of our help so she can live out her life in peace.  By helping her, we can stop this HOA from bullying and abusing other senior disabled single women and the many other people being abused by their HOA’s.  THANK YOU.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

To Put It Simply We're Trying To Do 3 Things
1.) Give this young man a future!!!!

How many 18 year olds have that kind of perspective? He's a victim a system that doesn't understand him, and doesn't care to. He needs to be provided with the oppurtunity to pursue higher learning outside the public school systems.
       
 2.) Transform the classroom to a 21st century model.

Operation Education Disruption Consists of Three Parts
Securing a Future for Jeff, Helping His School, and Healing the Situation by Creating New Methods of Bridging the Gap Between Students and Teachers

<p>For those who don't already know me, my name is Michael Cunningham. I'm currently a Junior at Biola University studying Cinema &amp; Media Arts.</p>
<p>I grew up on little. I was raised by a single mom in multiple living situations ranging from small apartments, to homeless shelters, motels and the occasional night in a car. The primary source of income was through child support and disability checks. I have five half-siblings who did not consistently live with my mom and I. I grew up like any other kid, going to school and playing with friends. The only difference between us was our parents’ income and marital status.</p>
<p>I wasn’t approached with the concept of college until 8<sup>th</sup> grade when we were talking about taking high school classes and how we would approach college the same way in high school. At this point I had moved from Bakersfield to Tustin and was getting used to the greater degree of difference in income between myself and everyone else around me. I never imagined myself going to college because it wasn’t a topic that was ever brought up at home.</p>
<p>Junior year was when most of my peers started looking at different colleges, it wasn’t until 3 months into my senior year that I was encouraged by my high school counselor to look into going to college.</p>
<p>I had become a Christian my junior year\]\and was eager to learn more about what my faith was about. The school that God lead me to was Biola. It was the only school I applied to, and I got accepted. It was a school that I could never have imagined being able to pay for, but God provided grants, scholarships and loans that covered the costs of attendance.</p>
<p>I’ve seen God’s grace transform the worst of sinners into a bumbling saint. I’ve seen His provision come through friends and family. In the unexplainable generosity of those who see a potential in me that I, at times, find hard to see.</p>
<p><strong>About the trip</strong></p>
<p>I'm at Biola on the bases of grace and grit. It’s the grace of God that brought me to an excellent institution and the grit required of me to do well in my studies.</p>
<p>Before I graduate in the fall of 2014, I have three amazing opportunities to take part in this year.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first is to help make a feature length film in Jakarta, Indonesia from June 18th to July 17th.</li>
<li>The second is to make a short documentary in a smaller village in Indonesia after the feature film. We will be documenting their culture and teaching English.  </li>
<li>The third is the opportunity to study abroad in London during my fall semester at Roehampton University.</li>
</ul><p>These different opportunities each have a unique outcome.</p>
<ul>
<li>Indonesia will give me the opportunity play a part in telling a unique story through film. It will also expose myself and others to a different culture and language which will broaden my understanding of the way others think and relate to each other.</li>
<li>London will be an opportunity for me to interact with people that attend Roehampton University from around the world while traveling and studying the history of Europe and their style of filmmaking.</li>
</ul><p>Both opportunities will expose me to different cultures, religions and worldviews that will allow me to better relate and work with those who don't share the same beliefs and cultural tendencies that I have. </p>
<p>By helping to fund me, you will not only be helping to produce a movie, but you will also be helping me learn how to better listen to and tell stories of people around the world. </p>
<p><strong>What is needed</strong></p>
<p>$8000 will fully fund my travel costs and room and board in Indonesia and London.</p>
<p>$2,000 of this will go toward the flight cost to Jakarta and Sulawesi, Indonesia. $300 will be going towards travel expenses in these areas. </p>
<p>$5,000 will be going towards the travel cost to and from London along with the cost of living at the school from September to December. $1,000 will be going towards the cost of food and any other travel expenses.</p>
<p>What I have to offer to you? Myself. That is, showing you what I do during my time in these places through a short documentary, us getting to know each other on a more personal level through a skype conversation or letters, you receiving a canvas printing of any of my photography that I take during my time overseas, etc.</p>
<p>If I shouldn't raise the full $8,000, the funds will still help me go on these trips. If I raise enough for the flight costs to Indonesia and London and rooming in London, then I will at least be able to take part in both programs and figure out the food situation when I get there. </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>My hope is that these trips wouldn't just be about school or film-making. I desire to express the same love and hope that I've found in Jesus to whomever I meet on these trips. After all, this hope gave me a reason to pursue a college education in the first place.</p>

<p><strong>Over the course of the last century human ingenuity has developed the means to completely eradicate all life on our beautiful planet. But we have also perfected the tools to reach an era of unparalleled human peace and understanding.</strong></p>
<p>The 2013 MBB Istanbul Peace Conference is a working gathering of experienced and new peace builders sponsored by Mediators Beyond Borders International (MBB), a non-profit NGO. This event will bring together women peace builders from the Middle East and North Africa, as well as university students and professional conflict resolvers from around the globe. MBB now seeks to bring Istanbul to every corner of the world via live-stream. <em>  </em></p>
<p> This gathering will be the 6th Congress of MBB and will take place September 24-28 Nearly 300 peace builders from 40 countries will come together in Istanbul, Turkey to train each other, share experiences, and make plans to reduce violence and inter-ethnic conflict, counter the aftermath of genocide and civil war and to prepare for the coming human storms resulting from Climate Change.</p>
<p>The tools of non-violence, mediation, and community dialogue, rooted in many ancient cultures, have been raised to new heights in the last 100 years.

Over the course of the last century human ingenuity has developed the means to completely eradicate all life on our beautiful planet. But we have also perfected the tools to reach an era of unparalleled human peace and understanding.
The 2013 MBB Istanbul Peace Conference is a working gathering of experienced and new peace builders sponsored by Mediators Beyond Borders International (MBB), a non-profit NGO. This event will bring together women peace builders from the Middle East and North Africa, as well as university students and professional conflict resolvers from around the globe. MBB now seeks to bring Istanbul to every corner of the world via live-stream.   
 This gathering will be the 6th Congress of MBB and will take place September 24-28 Nearly 300 peace builders from 40 countries will come together in Istanbul, Turkey to train each other, share experiences, and make plans to reduce violence and inter-ethnic conflict, counter the aftermath of genocide and civil war and to prepare for the coming human storms resulting from Climate Change.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Samantha. I am a single mom of 2 children. I am a blogger and a Business graduate from the Program at Lambton College. I have certificates in Indigenous Women in Community Leadership at St.Francis Xavier university and Aboriginal Management program at the Sauder School of Business. I need help with living expenses and/or tuition to attend the Royal Roads Bacholors of Commerce program in Entreprenuer Management. I would like to attend this year so I can get started in opening my business ASAP.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>British Columbia is an expensive place to live, and I need any help that you can give, if its monetary or hiring me for a resume rewrite.</p>
<p>We all love perks, for helping me and my family, you get love and graditute, resume and coverletter rewrites, mentoring sessions or help writing a proposal for your business or non profit.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The reason that I have studied business and am choosing this program is so I can open a teaching lodge upon graduation to assist women in starting small businesses. I believe women look at the impact business has from a social and community stand point and this will help us make more effective choices for our future generations and the planet. I think women in leadership make choices that are good for our children and grandchildren and that is why i want women to have a strong voice in board rooms, communities and within corperate structures. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Cap Haitien is a city of approximately 1 million people on the north coast of Haiti.   Many Haitiens currently live on $ 1US per day.  Among these individuals, life is even more difficult for Haitian women—many of whom are uneducated, unemployed, and struggling as single parents of multiple children to support their families.  C-NEW-C is successfully helping these women and their children make a better life for themselves.  Our three-pronged program provides</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>nutrition </strong> for malnourished infants and children</li>
<li>
<strong>education </strong>for these youth and their mothers</li>
<li>micro-loans that <strong>empower </strong> women to start small businesses and support their families. </li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p>The reasons for Haiti’s widespread poverty, high unemployment, infrastructural deficiencies, and ongoing challenges are deeply embedded in its unique history, but have increased recently due to the massive earthquake in January, 2010, and the largest cholera epidemic in human history, that began less than one year later.  In the face of these obstacles, our nutrition, education and micro-finance programs are already making a huge difference. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here’s what we know:  Children who suffer from malnutrition at a young age also experience developmental delays and challenges to learning.  In response to this, we created a Pre-School in 2012 to serve the needs of the toddlers in our Nutrition Program.  The Pre-School curriculum is specially geared to the developmental needs of our children and delivered at a pace that is both appropriate and responsive to the severe challenges they have faced early on in their lives.   Once our kids complete the pre-school program, they are ready to enter the mainstream school system with success.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Here’s where you come in:</strong>  We need to expand our pre-school program to meet the needs of our youth.  We have 52 students in need of our pre-school program, but only a current capacity to enroll and serve 20.  Help us move to a new location that will expand our pre-school from 3 classrooms to 8 classrooms and allow us to hire 3 additional teachers.  Our new location will be situated closer to the homes of the families we serve in Cap Haitien.  And while these youngsters receive much-needed early childhood education, their mothers will be acquiring business and trade skills that will result in greater self-sufficiency for themselves and their families.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p> Our goal is open an expanded pre-school in September of 2013.  Help us expand our reach and empower more women and families to thrive and not just survive. </p></div>","Support Mothers Become Financially Independent While Helping Their Children Learn

<p>“<em>Expedition Arunachal Pradesh</em>” is a photo documentary project by Jason K Powers covering one of the least known tribes in all of India.  Paired with the photo documentary, Jennifer Snyder will also be doing ethnographic research on this remote tribe.</p>
<p>There are many undocumented areas, many unseen faces, and so many untold stories in ‘<em>the land of the dawn-lit mountains</em>.’  One tribe has been chosen.  Jason intends to visit the Zakhring tribe who are positioned in one of the furthest north east regions of India in the valleys of the Himalayan Mountains of Arunachal Pradesh.</p>
<p>Arunachal Pradesh is bordered on three sides by Bhutan, China and Myanmar, with the rest of India to the South.  About ½ of Arunachal Pradesh is positioned in the Himalayan Mountains.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Tribe: Zakhring</strong></p>
<p>There is very little known about the Zakhring people.  A census done in 1981 revealed that there were only 14 members of their tribe remaining.  Living with the Zakhring people were another people group who identified themselves as the Meyor tribe, numbering around 240 people.  It is presumed that these two tribes merged at one time due to their low numbers.  If the population has continued to increase at a steady rate, the current population may be upwards of around 400, but if not, the population may have decreased to a startlingly low number, which could face the tribe with total extinction in the near future.  Interestingly, some sources suggest that neither of these names are the names in which they call themselves in their own language, which is the Charumba people.</p>
<p>The Zakhring peoples are believed to have migrated from Tibetat one time, and have resided in this area ever since.  Their religion is Buddhism which seems to be tinged with beliefs in a pre-Buddhist Bon religion.  It is not known whether they have their own literature or written language.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Game Plan</strong></p>
<p>Expedition Arunachal Pradesh has been broken down into two trips throughout the year.  The first trip was in early 2012 and served as more of a reconnaissance trip, including gathering information, visiting some of the places, talking to government officials, tour operators and the media.  Upon returning and sifting through lots of information and deciding on the specific tribe to document, Jason K Powers has commenced the task of putting together a small expedition to head back to Arunachal Pradesh in early 2013.</p>
<p>The decision to visit the Zakhring people was based on the fact that so little is known about this special tribe. Since they are also facing the possibility of total extinction, it is important to learn about such a unique people.  Jason felt that is was not enough to simply go in and ‘take photographs’ of these people, but to spend time with them and learn what he can about these people and share them with the world.</p>
<p>Through photography, Jason will be documenting, and telling the story of the Zakhring people.  Other plans are to be doing ethnographic research on this tribe with intent to release a book or small publications, telling the world about this tribe.</p>
<p>Jason intends to do various new and state of the art styles of documentary photography to be displayed in galleries, as well as creating a photo coffee table book about the tribe.  His photographs will also aid the research done by other anthropologist and Universities.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><em>Kids Who Love to Cook</em> is a web series, with cooking videos featuring kids making lots of delicious dishes.</p>
<p>There are also videos that show where food comes from and how it's made — the kids go to Stowe, VT to learn how to make cheese and maple syrup, they check out an unban bee farm in Brooklyn and explore rooftop farms. </p>
<p>We have food trips and contests, and we're always thinking of new ways to make food exciting for the beginner cook and young foodie.</p>
<p>The website is currently free of charge, and without any advertising. We want to keep it that way.</p>
<p>We want to encourage children to be curious about food, and build a passionate and engaged community who care about what we feed our body. Knowledge is power! We want kids to know about good food and eat well, and have a balanced attitude towards eating and life.</p>

<h3>What We Need and What You Get</h3>
<p>We want to produce Season 2 of <em>Kids Who Love to Cook</em> beginning Spring Break (we film when the kids are on school break).</p>
<p>Each video segment costs $1,500-2,000 to produce. A lot of us already work without pay but our production crew are struggling artists who can't afford to work gratis.</p>
<p>The creators of <em>Kids Who Love to Cook</em> have bootsrapped this project and are now producing other shows that are an off-shoot of KWLTC...new shows that feed the mind, and soul.

<p>We are only asking for what we need right now, and every little bit can be used.</p>
<p>We have spent a lot of time thinking of ways to thank you...the perks...and we have come up with a lot of yummy ways to show you our gratitude. The truth is that we could never give back enough.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Knowing how to cook is an invaluable life skill.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Cooking imparts a lot life lessons and is a terrific practice in planning, organizing, reading and math. Children naturally learn how to focus and be organized since cooking demands a certain amount of orderly, step-by-step way of doing things, an observance of basic rules and mastery of techniques. The payoff is something good to eat! Ahh...true self-esteem comes not from constant praise, but from being able to do things.</p>
<p>Good food, the kitchen, home, sense memory — more than just a cooking show, we at <em>Kids Who Love to Cook </em>believe that life's most meaningful moments happen during meals shared with family and friends: if a child knows how to cook, as one grows up, the home becomes an important place in one's life. Children from families who eat together do better in school, and later on in life.</p>
<p><em>Kids Who Love to Cook</em> has gotten a lot of praise: we have been featured in the Chicago Tribune and we got USA Character approved within 2 weeks of our launch.

<p>Hi, I'm James Ketchell and I need your help to undertake the Ultimate Triathlon. Following my solo Atlantic row (2010) and summiting of Everest (2011), I've been fortunate that these experiences have enabled me to help young people broaden their horizons too.</p>
<p>Having established a programme of visits to schools, Scout groups and other youth organisations, the reaction I get has humbled and inspired me. And the greater the challenges I have met, the greater is my capability to inspire and motivate.</p>
<p>So, my goal is simply to use my experiences to inspire and motivate young people to set and achieve challenging goals – to push their own limits.</p>
<h3><strong>How can you help?</strong></h3>
<p>Step 1 - Buy a Perk (right hand side of this page)</p>
<p>Step 2 - Follow our blog on the <a href=""http://www.jamesketchell.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a> </p>

<h3><strong>What is the Ultimate Triathlon?</strong></h3>
<p>The Ultimate Triathlon has never been attempted before. It consists of :-</p>
<ul>
<li>Rowing the Atlantic</li>
<li>Climbing Everest</li>
<li>Cycling Round the World</li>
</ul><p>In 2013, I will attempt the aim to complete the above within 365 days.</p>
<p><strong><em>Row the Atlantic</em></strong></p>
<p>I will row across the Atlantic Ocean, departing from La Gomera and ending after 3000 miles in Barbados. Setting off in January allows me to take advantage of the trade winds and currents that establish themselves at this time of year. I am to arrive 50-60 days later in time for the start of the Himalayan climbing season.</p>
<p><em><strong>Climb Everest</strong></em></p>
<p>Following the row I will head to Nepal to start the acclimatisation phase. Having already been fortunate enough to stand on top of Mount Everest, I am confident, but only too aware of how tough and unforgiving the environment is. Whilst in Nepal, I plan to document the story of the amazing Nepalese people and their culture as part of my education programme.</p>
<p><em><strong>Cycle Round the World</strong></em></p>
<p>On the 1st of July I will depart from London on a global cycle of just over 18,000 miles. I will have six months to cover the distance and make it back to London to ensure the Ultimate Triathlon can be completed within 12 months.</p>
<h3>
<strong>W</strong><strong>hy support Pushing Limits?</strong>
</h3>
<p>The ultimate aim of the project is to inspire young people to push their own limits and work towards goals that may appear difficult or impossible to achieve. Following my last Atlantic row and Everest climb, I have been visiting schools, Scout groups and other youth organisations, inspiring them to push their limits.</p>

<p>During every phase of the Ultimate Triathlon I will be linking up with schools around the world, sharing stories of my adventures and connecting them with other schools and youth organisations around the world to share their cultures and achievements.</p>
<p>Throughout the project I will also be raising awareness for the children’s charity <a href=""http://www.elifarfoundation.org.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The ELIFAR Foundation</a>, an amazing organisation that supports disabled children, allowing them to achieve more. </p>
<p><strong>What motivates me?</strong></p>
<p>In 2008 I was recovering from a serious motorcycle accident that left me with broken legs and a severely broken and dislocated ankle. The prognosis was that I was likely to suffer a permanent walking impairment and would certainly not be able to continue the active physical lifestyle I had enjoyed up to that point.</p>
<p>Undeterred, and after a lot of physiotherapy and training, I rowed the Atlantic single-handed in 2010, then on 16th May 2011 I reached the summit of Mount Everest.  </p>
<h3><strong>The Pushing Limits Team</strong></h3>
<p>I am lucky enough to be supported by a wonderful team of people, without whom this project just simply wouldn't be possible. They're all volunteers and give of their time freely because they're as passionate as me about helping the youth of today to broaden their horizons :-</p>

It's about my education. This is a legitimate year of school for me, my junior year of high school. Obviously it is an amazing oppurtunity, but it'll be tough for me as well.

<h2>My Exchange to Finland</h2>
<p>Hi, I'm Victoria, and I am a future exchange student from Illinois in the US, and I am going to Finland this August for about a year. This campaign is to raise the mandatory funds for my exchange. These costs include my insurance, my plane ticket, the mandatory language camp I have to take when I go to Finland, and several other things. With each dollar I raise here, it's a dollar less out of my parents' wallets. It's been my dream since I can remember to be an exchange student, and now that it's finally going to happen, I want to keep it as cheap as possible for my parents.</p>
<h3>Isn't $7000 a lot?</h3>
<p>Well, yeah it is, which is the problem I have. $7000 is so much money, and I can't help but cringe at the thought of my parents having to shell every single dollar out of their wallets. Anything over the $7000 I raise will be pocket money for me while I'm there, which would be pretty nice.</p>
<p>This exchange is something I've always wanted to do, and the fact that Rotary wants to send me to Finland is unbelievable. I'll get to study in a Finnish high school and stay with 1-3 host families throughout my year on exchange. The year in Finland will bring me unique experiences that I wouldn't necessarily find in America. I'll get a taste of a completely different culture and through the year I will learn new things about the world, as well as about myself.</p>
<h2>The Big Impact</h2>
<p>As an exchange student, I will be an ambassador for peace and understanding between people from different countries. I will go to different places and be able to break traditional stereotypes. When these stereotypes are broken, communications are open and people will realize that in the end we're all so similar. That is one of the coolest things about foreign exchange, in my opinion, and I'd love to be able to participate.</p>
<h3>Don't forget to share!</h3>
<p>I understand that not everyone has the money, but that doesn't mean you can't help! Please don't hesitate to share my page with your friends, family, co-workers, etc. Any amount of money helps me out and is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p> </p>

<p><strong>INTRO</strong></p>
<p><em>""Artists share the calling, according to their disciplines and crafts, to cast the new images of mythology. That is, they provide the contemporary metaphors that allow us to realize the transcendent, infinite, and abundant nature of being as it is."" </em><strong>- <em>Joseph Campbell</em></strong></p>
<p>Second-year NYU grad student/theatre artist here with a heartfelt plea for support as I endeavor to make my way to St. Louis for the conference of a lifetime! My name is Wilfredo Hernandez (bio and more info at <a href=""http://www.whtheatre.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.whtheatre.com</a>) and I'm a M.A. candidate at the NYU Gallatin School of Individualized Study where I am pursuing a concentration in Directing &amp; Producing Theatre - <em>mythic theatre</em> to be specific. I'm entering into the last leg of my program and starting work on my artistic thesis, which entails both written and production components. <strong><em>Mythic Theatre</em></strong> is a term that I've created in the course of my studies and work to describe theatre that specifically examines myth (both narrative and symbol) through performance in an attempt to explore the meaning of the stories we as human beings hold so dear - both throughout history and in society today (i.e. political myths, stereotypes, creation/nature myths, heroic myths, love myths, etc.). I’m ultimately interested in learning how myths are embodied, performed, perpetuated and deconstructed. I believe theatre to be the best medium to accomplish this.</p>

<p><em>“The myths told by the people should be studied and analyzed and their hidden truths revealed. In this task the theatre can be extraordinarily useful.”  </em>                       <strong><em>Augusto Boal</em></strong></p>
<p>Aside from the study of antiquity, myth and theatre has not been addressed in a comprehensive way in academia or in the field at large. I hope to change this by examining timely issues of socio-political importance through a mythic lens. My thesis, entitled <em>The Prometheia Project (TPP)</em>, will use the <em>Prometheus </em>mythos to examine issues of oppression, equality and power - specifically through the eyes of the LGBTQ community in the United States. I will work with a diverse collective of artists, scholars and activists to re-imagine the lost Prometheia trilogy of Aeschylus in an effort to create theatre that is epic in scope, generative and regenerative for artist, audience and community. After mounting the initial production this fall, I hope to replicate the frameworks and resources used for this project to work towards mounting various cycles of <em>The Prometheia Project</em> across the country and dedicated to issues of local, regional, national and international concern. In doing this, theatre can become a tool for community engagement, discourse and positive transformation. Attending this conference is the first step in achieving all of this and I invite you to be a part of what promises to be an exciting artistic journey. </p>
<p>I was recently awarded a partial scholarship from the Gallatin Dean's Research &amp; Travel Fund to attend the Mid-America Theatre Conference in St. Louis, MO, March 7-10. Celebrating its 34<sup>th</sup> year, the MATC conference has chosen <em>MYTH</em> as this year’s theme. It is a serendipitous occasion and truly a once in a lifetime opportunity to attend an event of this nature that is solely focused around my area of specialization. This partial scholarship will cover registration and food expenses, therefore I am turning to you for help in funding travel, transportation, lodging costs for this four day conference. These costs amount to approximately <strong>$800</strong>. Your help in funding this endeavor would not be simply to send a struggling graduate student to a conference - you would be contributing to the very development of the field of theatre and to the birth of a new theatrical form in America. This is a rare opportunity to tread new territory and contribute something to the legacy of one of this ancient art form. You would not be a funder or a patron – <strong><em>you would be a</em></strong> <strong><em>collaborator…a myth-maker</em></strong>. </p>
<p>Full disclosure time – I will <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">not</span></strong> be able to attend this conference without your support. My family and I, like so many who hail from central NJ and the East Coast, were hit very hard during Hurrican Sandy and finances have been extremely rocky as of late. In the interest of building open and honest communication, below is a breakdown of my expenses so you know exactly what is being funded:</p>
<p><strong><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">TRAVEL</span></em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Lodging: $450.00 <em>(for 5 nights)</em>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The conference is a four day event exploring the interesctions of myth and theatre with representatives from theatre companies, colleges and universities from across the country - this could very well be my first (and only) shot to explore my ideas in such a comprehensive and resource driven environment.

""Artists share the calling, according to their disciplines and crafts, to cast the new images of mythology. That is, they provide the contemporary metaphors that allow us to realize the transcendent, infinite, and abundant nature of being as it is."" - Joseph Campbell
Second-year NYU grad student/theatre artist here with a heartfelt plea for support as I endeavor to make my way to St. Louis for the conference of a lifetime! My name is Wilfredo Hernandez (bio and more info at www.whtheatre.com) and I'm a M.A. candidate at the NYU Gallatin School of Individualized Study where I am pursuing a concentration in Directing & Producing Theatre - mythic theatre to be specific. I'm entering into the last leg of my program and starting work on my artistic thesis, which entails both written and production components. Mythic Theatre is a term that I've created in the course of my studies and work to describe theatre that specifically examines myth (both narrative and symbol) through performance in an attempt to explore the meaning of the stories we as human beings hold so dear - both throughout history and in society today (i.e. political myths, stereotypes, creation/nature myths, heroic myths, love myths, etc.). I’m ultimately interested in learning how myths are embodied, performed, perpetuated and deconstructed. I believe theatre to be the best medium to accomplish this.

I am a retired Periodontal Hygienist turned Mission Worker. My mission: To help provide orphaned children in Kenya a secondary education.</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>HIV/AIDS has taken its toll on many families in Kenya, leaving in its wake, more orphans per capital than any other country in the world. There are extremely limited resources for the proper care and development of these precious children.</strong></h3>
<p>I have been to Kenya twice, once in March of 2011 and the second time in February of 2013. Kenya itself is making slow progress but orphaned children are still very much at risk.  Orphaned children turn to the streets, hoping to make a living selling whatever they can find. Unfortunately, more often than not, they are used by gangs or for prostitution. Forced into illicit drug and alcohol activities or shipped off as slave labor.  </p>
<p>Some start their schooling but due to financial/family/housing issues miss more school than they are able to attend. Unable to complete their education, they turn to the streets as a way to earn a living. </p>
<p>I met Tobias in March of 2011, after he had been a part of Each One Touch One Orphanage (EOTOO) for about a year. He had tried to survive as a street child but was failing and abused. He was a bright, respectful boy, who was genuinely appreciative of his new life and family at EOTOO.</p>
<p>Tobias and I spoke again in February of 2013. He is still the same kind and respectful person I first met but has become more confident. He is an above average student with strong potential. Small for his age but filled with hope and promise, he understands what life is like for children of his background, without an education, and longs to do something more with his life...He has a dream!</p>
<p>Primary education in Kenya is from Standard (Grade) 1-8. The cost of uniforms and standardized government testing is costly for parents and orphanages. Secondary education is <strong>not</strong> paid for by the Kenyan Government. It consists of four more years of academic training before taking government tests for college placement. All Kenyan children must have financial backing to attend secondary school. In the case of orphans there is usually no financial backing. Most orphanages cannot afford the cost.</p>
<p>The Kenyan Department of Children requires that all children living in orphanages must become totally independent by age 17-18. Tobias' time at EOTOO is quickly coming to an end. At 16-1/2 years of age, he is now the oldest child living at EOTOO. He has two options: 1) Be sponsored to attend secondary school and work hard to achieve the test scores needed to attend University/College or 2) Find a way to earn a living on his own. Even trade Schools are non-existent or financially unaffordable to orphans and non-orphans alike. </p>
<p>The cost of secondary education in Kenya is $2000 US per year for four years. A total cost of $8000 US.  All secondary schools in Kenya are boarding schools. Children must leave their families and travel to a school designated by the government, as determined by that particular child’s standardized test scores.  Tobias has just finished taking the tests and scored well, 350 points out of 500 points. This means he is eligible for a secondary boarding school.</p>
<p>The $2000 US/year cost of the boarding school includes all room and board, tuition, uniforms and shoes including underwear and socks, books and educational materials, travel from EOTOO to the boarding school and back, all government required tests, incidentals such as toiletries, paper and pencils…Only the essentials.  </p>
<p>Tobias must be able to pay his first installment to the boarding school by January 1, 2014. The head mistress of EOTOO, Alice K., will make the arrangements for his travel and attendance at boarding school. Any funding collected by this campaign will be placed in a fund for Tobias through PurposeQuest, a long standing non-profit, established by Dr. John Stanko, Administrative Pastor at Allegheny Center Christian and Missionary Alliance Church located on the North Side of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Dr. Stanko has been raising funds for EOTOO and other orphanages and programs in Kenya for more than 17 years. He visits these orphanages and programs two to three times a year personally. This campaign will be administered through Dr. Stanko's non-profit. Any funding of this project will be designated and earmarked for this Campaign.</p>
<p>For more information regarding Purpose Quest or the other programs established by Dr. Stanko, please go to <a href=""http://purposequest.com/contributions"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://purposequest.com/contributions</a>.</p>
<p>Funding for Tobias will be held in escrow and used as needed. Receipts for all spending will be required from EOTOO and the boarding school, even for incidentals. Tobias will be held accountable for his progress in school. He will also be required to send letters monthly concerning his experiences at school. The receipts, test scores and letters will be available on the PurposeQuest website.</p>
<p>Our initial goal is to raise enough funding for Tobias' first two years of secondary school, which is $3,800. If and when that goal is reached, the funding over the goal would be spent to support him through all four years of secondary school. Ultimately we would like to be able to support many deserving orphans in this way.</p>
<p>Tobias has a dream to encourage and mentor his orphaned brothers and sisters. Giving hope and a ""leg up"" to others is quite a dream for a young boy. I can personally vouch for his integrity. If anyone can reach his dream, Tobias can. </p>
<p>Someone once said ""Feed a man a fish and he eats...teach a man to fish and he can feed himself""! Self-esteem is an important key for a brighter future. A hand-out is no help. A ""leg -up"" is the beginning of healthy independence. </p>
<p>So what can you, as one person, do to make a positive difference in such a vast and seemingly desperate situation? Have you ever heard the old adage, ""How do you eat an elephant?""..... The answer: ""one bite at a time.""  </p>
<p><span>Will you stand with Tobias and take that first bite? Offer that ""leg-up""? Even if you cannot give support financially, would you partner with him in prayer? Be an encouragement to him? Pass this campaign on to others you know who may be able to help? We are connected to Facebook and Twitter. Indiegogo provides the tools necessary to spread the word.  Any support given will be extremely appreciated! God Bless You! </span></p>

<p>My name is Tsvia Horesh. I am an Israeli music therapist with 23 years of experience, working with children, youth and adults with varied  emotional and physical disabilities.</p>
<p>This campaign aims to send two Israeli music therapists to Yangon, Myanmar, for 4 weeks, to work with staff in special education schools. The Israeli volunteers  will support the local staff in establishing sustainable “music as therapy” programs in their schools. I will join them for the first week of the project, to oversee and pass on my experience to make sure that the project will run smoothly in my absence and continue to support them in their work via skype after that.</p>
<p>Myanmar is a country in S.E. Asia which has recently been going through significant political, social and economical changes. Most of the helping professions commonly used in the treatment of special needs children – music therapy being one of them  – are not taught in Myanmar universities. By helping fund this project you can contribute to the empowerment of local educational staff, and through them, to the enhancement of the  emotional and social well being of special needs children.  </p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What is Music Therapy</span></p>
<p>Music Therapy is an established health profession in which music is used within a therapeutic relationship to address physical, emotional, cognitive, and social needs of individuals.  It is implemented by a  credentialed professional who has completed an approved music therapy program.</p>
<p>Clearly we are not going to train people to be music therapists in 4 weeks. But our experience has shown that intensive, hands-on training, can be beneficial in enabling local staff to use music in a therapeutic way for the kids they work with.</p>
<p>This project is being done in partnership with the Music as Therapy International Charity <a href=""http://www.musicastherapy.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.musicastherapy.org/</a> .</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What We Need </span></p>
<p>The parents the Montessori Home for Children in Yangon, one of the schools we will be working in, are very keen for their children to continue to enjoy the benefits of  regular music sessions.  They have managed to secure all our accommodation and food for the whole 4 weeks. This really does prove how committed they are to receiving more input from us.</p>
<p>In addition, we need to raise <strong>6500$</strong> to cover air tickets, local transportation, visas  and an emergency fund.  Any extra money will be used to buy more musical instruments for the schools and to cover ongoing support for the local partners.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The Impact</span></p>
<p>Last year I spent 2 1/2  weeks in Myanmar, teaching 25 teachers from 9 different  special education schools in Yangon – the basics of therapeutic music techniques . The participants were very enthusiastic about starting music as therapy programs in their schools, but also apprehensive about how they will do this on their own, after finishing the course. I came back 5 months later for a 3 day followup.</p>

<p> </p></div>","Short Summary
My name is Tsvia Horesh. I am an Israeli music therapist with 23 years of experience, working with children, youth and adults with varied  emotional and physical disabilities.
This campaign aims to send two Israeli music therapists to Yangon, Myanmar, for 4 weeks, to work with staff in special education schools. The Israeli volunteers  will support the local staff in establishing sustainable “music as therapy” programs in their schools. I will join them for the first week of the project, to oversee and pass on my experience to make sure that the project will run smoothly in my absence and continue to support them in their work via skype after that.
Myanmar is a country in S.E. Asia which has recently been going through significant political, social and economical changes. Most of the helping professions commonly used in the treatment of special needs children – music therapy being one of them  – are not taught in Myanmar universities. By helping fund this project you can contribute to the empowerment of local educational staff, and through them, to the enhancement of the  emotional and social well being of special needs children.  
What is Music Therapy
Music Therapy is an established health profession in which music is used within a therapeutic relationship to address physical, emotional, cognitive, and social needs of individuals.  It is implemented by a  credentialed professional who has completed an approved music therapy program.
Clearly we are not going to train people to be music therapists in 4 weeks. But our experience has shown that intensive, hands-on training, can be beneficial in enabling local staff to use music in a therapeutic way for the kids they work with.
This project is being done in partnership with the Music as Therapy International Charity http://www.musicastherapy.org/ .
 
What We Need 
The parents the Montessori Home for Children in Yangon, one of the schools we will be working in, are very keen for their children to continue to enjoy the benefits of  regular music sessions.  They have managed to secure all our accommodation and food for the whole 4 weeks. This really does prove how committed they are to receiving more input from us.
In addition, we need to raise 6500$ to cover air tickets, local transportation, visas  and an emergency fund.  Any extra money will be used to buy more musical instruments for the schools and to cover ongoing support for the local partners.
The Impact
Last year I spent 2 1/2  weeks in Myanmar, teaching 25 teachers from 9 different  special education schools in Yangon – the basics of therapeutic music techniques . The participants were very enthusiastic about starting music as therapy programs in their schools, but also apprehensive about how they will do this on their own, after finishing the course. I came back 5 months later for a 3 day followup.
This course was supported by:
* the Israeli embassy in Yangon,
 *Triangle Génération Humanitaire - an international humanitarian NGO http://trianglegh.org/,
and *ECDC – Eden Center for disabled children Yangon http://www.edencentre.org/
I wanted to make sure that I was delivering the training to the best of my ability so I sought consultancy from the UK charity Music as Therapy International . This charity has been delivering introductory music as therapy skill sharing projects overseas for over 15 years so they have plenty of experience! They  were so impressed by what I & the local partners had managed to achieve that they have offered their support again this year for phase 2 of the project
 This project is  responding to a need that the schools expressed. As you can see in the attached video, since last year’s course they have been using music therapeutically with the children they work with. But they need more professional input and support – and so asked for this continuing  program.

<p>Be The Hope began as a dream and desire to do more. My name is Heather Hinze and I am a 40(ish!) single mom of a 16 year old daughter and a licensed foster parent. Thanks to a pair of shoes, a book, water, a burlap bag and a hatred of cubicles I am taking a leap of faith to realize my dream of changing the lives of children in Haiti. To learn more about how it all started, please visit my blog: <a href=""http://www.bethehopehaiti.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>www.bethehopehaiti.wordpress.com</strong></a>. </p>
<p><strong>Our Mission</strong></p>
<p>Be The Hope is a non profit organization with a mission to provide a backpack full of school supplies to children in Haiti, which will help alleviate the financial burden on their families. We believe education is a human right, not a privilege.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>We are starting with 150 children in Cite Soleil. The children are from Agape Orphanage, La Main Tendre Orphanage, Frem Orphanage, Cite Soleil Youth Center and Mix Emmanuel Primary School. Cite Soleil is in Port au Prince, Haiti. It is the poorest and most dangerous area in the Western Hemisphere and also one of the largest slums in the Northern Hemisphere. An estimated 150,000 of Cite Soleil’s residents are orphaned or abandoned children. Seventy percent of these children are school age; however they do not attend school. In Haiti, 55% of the population lives below the poverty line of $1.25 per day. Due to the cost of school fees, school supplies, and uniforms many families can't afford to send their children to school.</p>
<p>We believe if all Haitian children had access to an education, their potential to both end the cycle of poverty and contribute to the recovery of Haiti would increase. According to UNICEF, education contributes to greater civic participation and helps to combat youth violence, sexual harassment and human trafficking. It also results in a range of health benefits including lower infant mortality, reduced domestic violence and improved child nutrition. For many Haitian children, a school lunch is the only meal that they can count on receiving all day. Education can foster social empowerment, enabling an entire generation to become economically independent and positive contributors to society. Education is an important part of the successful rebuilding of Haiti.</p>
<p><strong>The Backpack Project</strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to raise enough funds to purchase 150 backpacks, which we will deliver in May 2013. Each backpack will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 - backpack</li>
<li>1 - hand pencil sharpener</li>
<li>1 - 24 count crayons</li>
<li>2 - 100 page composition notebooks</li>
<li>1 - 12 count #2 pencils</li>
<li>1 - pencil case</li>
<li>1 - eraser</li>
<li>1 - 10 pack ball point pens</li>
<li>1 - 12"" ruler</li>
</ul><p>We have partnered with a company that will pre-assemble the backpacks to our specifications. A complete backpack can be purchased for only $25.00! If you're a parent of a school age child, think about what you spend every year on school supplies. If you're like me, the backpack alone is more than $25.00. </p>
<p>If we do not reach our fundraising goal, we will purchase as many backpacks as we can with the funds raised. </p>
<p>If we surpass our goal (as we hope we do!), there are many more things that we would like accomplish! The schools are also in need of chalk, chalkboard erasers, and arts and crafts supplies. There's already another school of 106 children that is in desperate need of help and we would LOVE to help them. No penny will go to waste!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Colleen. Michelle and I left for Japan on the same day in 2004 to join the JET Programme to teach English in high schools in Japan.  Michelle has Lupus and while teaching there she became too old to stay on her parents' insurance.  Since returning would mean a gap in health insurance coverage unless she could land a job while still out of the country, she was essentially trapped in Japan, moving from terrible job to terrible job after the economy collapsed in 2008, needing to hold on to her connection to health care.  In order to return she would need to find a job with insurance.  Job searching from out of the country was impossible, but if she went back to search for jobs she would be uninsured for the duration since Lupus is a pre-existing condition that makes it impossible even to pay for it.</p>
<p>Michelle is a dedicated teacher, and wants to continue her education in information sciences to work as a medical librarian, teaching and helping medical students and doctors find the health information they need. Her background as a teacher, writer, researcher, and her history with the medical system give her all the tools she needs.   She will excel at this, but now has worry and debt hanging over her.  Let's help! </p>
<p>This year (2013) she got into graduate school with some funding and most importantly - insurance, so her Japanese doctors sent her home with some secret meds to tide her over for the three months until school started and her assistantship would start to cover health insurance.  Unfortunately Michelle's heart decided not to cooperate and she spent five days in the ICU, uninsured.  She had a pericardial effusion due to complications of her Lupus. This means the sack around her heart filled with fluid and could barely beat. Miraculously, massive doses of antibiotics narrowly avoided surgery.  She is fit again and ready for school, but now the bills are due.</p>
<p>As she says, ""<span>I also had a brush in with a horrid woman from collections while I was in the ICU. Who talks to a heart patient with no health insurance about money while she's strung out on morphine? She came in to see if I qualified for financial assistance from the hospital but then told me I didn't qualify after asking me a handful of questions. I got annoyed and asked her how an unemployed woman with no health insurance and who would be starting grad school in a month not qualify. She explained that they had already done a credit check on me and since I never had anything repossessed and I paid my bills on time they felt I could make another payment...<span>The hospital alone was around $32,000. Because I was uninsured they dropped it to $11,000. They would have dropped it to $8,000 if I could have paid within ten days of leaving the hospital, but I didn't have that kind of money just lying around. </span><br/></span>I am also getting additional bills trickling in every day for individual departments, tests and doctors within the hospital.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<h3><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;""></span></h3>
</div><div>
<p>In the past academic semester, Cornell students have catalogued existing and potential sustainable practices in South Africa and have created a comprehensive atlas of their research.  This 200-page atlas will inform the design of a 6,000 square foot Early Childhood Development center (known locally as a crèche) and is currently in three of Cornell's libraries and throughout the design studio. Cornell architecture students will complete the design within the next few weeks and the crèche will be constructed by volunteer students during Summer 2011 in Cosmo City, South Africa. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Currently, children in Cosmo City attend school in a 6ft x 6ft room with 79 other students.  This will be the first official crèche in Cosmo City.  With the introduction of Schoolhouse South Africa's crèche, children up to age 7 will be able to attend a school that affords them space to learn and play.  </p>
<p>This project also includes a teacher training center that will allow for other schools to have their teachers trained by Education Africa.  In this way, the benefit of our school is not limited to only the students attending the school.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The schoolhouse will cost ultimately around $150,000.  We are looking to reach a minimum of $50,000 here on indiegogo.com within the next two months.  This money covers only materials and permits.  The labor to build the crèche is all volunteer (30 eager students and 10 local African laborers), and the travel cost will all be covered by the volunteers as well.  We are very fortunate to also have the support of alumni of the CUSD program, the school, and family and friends.</p>
<p>The book from our extensive research (for use in the design phase, as well as to encourage other people and organizations in similar projects by providing a solid starting point) can be seen here.</p>

Our Story


In the past academic semester, Cornell students have catalogued existing and potential sustainable practices in South Africa and have created a comprehensive atlas of their research.  This 200-page atlas will inform the design of a 6,000 square foot Early Childhood Development center (known locally as a crèche) and is currently in three of Cornell's libraries and throughout the design studio. Cornell architecture students will complete the design within the next few weeks and the crèche will be constructed by volunteer students during Summer 2011 in Cosmo City, South Africa. 


The Impact
Currently, children in Cosmo City attend school in a 6ft x 6ft room with 79 other students.  This will be the first official crèche in Cosmo City.  With the introduction of Schoolhouse South Africa's crèche, children up to age 7 will be able to attend a school that affords them space to learn and play.  
This project also includes a teacher training center that will allow for other schools to have their teachers trained by Education Africa.  In this way, the benefit of our school is not limited to only the students attending the school.


What We Need & What You Get
The schoolhouse will cost ultimately around $150,000.  We are looking to reach a minimum of $50,000 here on indiegogo.com within the next two months.  This money covers only materials and permits.  The labor to build the crèche is all volunteer (30 eager students and 10 local African laborers), and the travel cost will all be covered by the volunteers as well.  We are very fortunate to also have the support of alumni of the CUSD program, the school, and family and friends.
The book from our extensive research (for use in the design phase, as well as to encourage other people and organizations in similar projects by providing a solid starting point) can be seen here.

<p><a href=""connectingborders.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Connecting Borders Foundation</a> has been helping children in Peru for 3 1/2 years, as well as the co-founders personally helping for 4 years before that.  This year, in August, we will be returning to Peru for a 2 week trip, taking some volunteers.</p>
<p>We have raised the funds to purchase 2 computer systems (2 PC/Servers, with 4 monitor stations each) to take to an all girls dormatory in Ollantaytambo, Peru.  We will also be visiting an orphanage in Oropesa that we provide monthly support to.</p>
<p>Our next goal is to provide every kid at both organizations with backpacks, stuffed with school supplies, and warm clothing/blankets, at a minimum.  We will be arriving just as they are returning to school from the Winter Break.</p>
</div>
<div>

<p>Here's how your contributions will help:</p>
<p>If we raise...</p>
<p>$500 - Brand new backpacks and blankets/warm clothing.</p>
<p>$600 - Paper, pencils, erasers, pens, crayons, etc. to fill the backpacks.</p>
<p>$750 - New socks and underwear for all kids to start the rest of the school year, with the backpacks and school supplies.</p>
<p>$1000 - $125 stipend at each location to help replenish school supplies for the rest of the school year.</p>
<p>$2500 + - We would purchase more multi-station computers for these and other organizations, as part of our CBF Education Network.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>The Mission:</h3>
<p>Our mission here at The Good Samaritan is to help people learn to better themselves by giving them an invaluable skill, the knowledge of the English language.</p>
<p><strong>The Campaign:</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are raising $500 for this summer's Summer Camp in which we will combine classroom instruction in the English language followed by games such as baseball, volleyball, and gymnastics.  This is important because the students here will be more inclined to come to class because they know that they will also be having fun. </p>
<p>About <strong>67%</strong> of girls here in the Dominican Republic drop out of school according to UNESCO studies. Overall, this campaign is extremely important to the world because if we help more poeple to learn English here in the Dominican, we will be able to raise the standard of living and decrease the poverty level, as well as help the global economic conditions.</p>
<p>Knowing English, and knowing it well, is a first-class ticket to a good job here in the Dominican Republic due to the tourism industry.  The Good Samaritan is an outlet for these people because it allows them to continue learning, and gives them a safe envirionment.  Most of these kids don't have electricity when they return home, nor do they have a solid family structure supporting them.  By contributing to this campaign, you will be directly helping these kids and adults to make a better life for themselves and their families.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<h3>What We Need:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Textbooks for all students ($250 RD each, which is about $6.25 US each; we will need about $100 for this, but maybe more due to the fact that more people attend summer camp)</li>
<li>Other School Supplies (Crayons, markers, paper, etc. $100 US)</li>
<li>Sports Equipment (baseballs, bases, volleyball, volleyball net, and gymnastics equipment--roughly $100 US)</li>
<li>First Aid Kits ($25 US)</li>
<li>Water</li>
<li>Miscellaneous Items (garbage bins, cups, etc., $50)</li>

<p>If we don't reach our goal of $500, we will still keep the money, and take the 9% hit on the flex funding option. </p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Some of these kids and adults literally have nothing.  They live in barrios which are not only lacking in clean water and electricity, but they can also be quite dangerous places to live.  As previously mentioned, about 67% of female students drop out of school.  According to dominicandream.org, the Domincan Republic's investment into public education is only 2.3% of their GDP (gross domestic product), which is ranked 122 out of 132 countries.  They were also ranked 101 out of 177 countries in terms of literacy, and only 12% of low-income students who start high school will complete their studies, compared to 62% of those from higher income brackets in the DR.</p>
<p>If you contribute to this campaign, you will directly be impacting the lives of these people by giving them a skill that cannot easily be taken away; knowledge.  Throughout the history of the world, we have seen that the only real way to better ourselves and our society is through education.  By helping these people to learn the English language, we will be helping to open doors to brighter future.  If they learn English, then they will be able to work in the tourism industry, and therefore increase their income and provide a better life for their family.  This in turn will also help the Dominican Republic's economy because if they know English, then tourism will increase.  If tourism increases, then the money spent here will increase, which will therefore increase the standard of living of the Dominican's. </p>
<p>These students are very special people.  I have never met so many people who are so excited to learn.  Not only are they excited to learn English, but they are also excited to learn about us, the volunteers.  They are a very loving group of people and will gladly invite you into their homes for lunch or dinner.  I've never experienced such kindness, with nothing expected in return. </p>
</div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute, that's okay!  Money isn't the only way that you can help us out.  Just by spreading the word, you can dramatically make a difference because you probably know someone who is willing and able to donate. </p>
<p>Just as a reminder, you can use the Indiegogo share tools.  Another good way to share this is via Facebook!  Thanks so much for your time!</p></div>","The Mission:

Short Summary Think back to your most memorable travel experience. Who did you travel with? Where did you visit? 
Regardless of purpose or destination; travel changes us. It forces us to step out of our comfort zone, experience diverse cultures, and most importantly learn about ourselves. Why should only some students have the opportunity to experience the positive benefits of travel?
Trip of a Lifetime aims to change the way students experience travel by providing summer travel scholarships and leadership development programs to deserving students that might never have the opportunity to travel otherwise. The organization needs your help this holiday season to make our vision a reality.
Here are some highlights of Trip of a Lifetime:  Provided scholarships for 44 underprivileged students
Completely student run and operated
Featured in the Wall Street Journal, NY Post, and Poughkeepsie Journal
Recognized by the New York City Department of Education 



Bria T, Briana T, Peaches W, and Selina A at Alcatraz, Summer 2014

  What We Need & What You Get  This holiday season, we are asking for $5,000, enough to provide a full travel scholarship to one student. While this is a lot of money, remember that each student trip impacts an additional 25-50 students upon their return! In return for your generosity, we have some great perks available including t-shirts, hoodies, and travel themed gift baskets, all designed by trip alumni themselves.  



Trip of a Lifetime founder Stan Rosenberg and Nouman I, Summer 2014 alumnus at a school visit in Brooklyn, NY

   The Impact  Travel is more than a trip; it's a lifelong journey. Your gift will instill leadership, confidence, and hope in some of this generation's brightest students, enabling them to become catalysts for change in their communities. Trip of a Lifetime is completely student run and operated. We have no overhead cost or full time staff so every dollar counts 
Did You Know: 100% of all Trip of a Lifetime alumni are currently in college or are college bound

Don't just take it from us. Here are some testimonials from students that have traveled with our organization:

In an ‘inner city’ high school, you’re more than a teacher; you are, at times, a confidant, a counsellor, a listening ear and a helping hand. The responsibility that comes with teaching is both terrifying and inspiring, and my first few years of teaching have motivated me to use my passion, energy, and skills to assist others in need, and I believe Kenya is the perfect destination for this. </p>

<p>My first year of teaching at a high school in Scarborough certainly opened my eyes to the struggles that many families within the school community endure. Despite these hardships, the children in our community have the option of attending a local and safe school, where there is a roof over their head, a pencil in hand, paper to write on, materials to use, and programs to provide basic meals.</p>

<p>Many Kenyan students are not fortunate enough to have access to the aforementioned items; it was only recently that education alone was made free. For the month of August, as a volunteer with <em>Free the Children: Adventure Learning Experience,</em> I will be given the opportunity to dedicate my time and energy to a community in need. I am going to teach and volunteer at local schools, contribute to the building of a school, and assist to improve the local community of the Masai Mara.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is where I need you help:</p>
<p>We are asked to bring supplies and materials to conduct our lessons as well as to donate to the local school. The schools are in dire need of pencils, pens, markers, pencil crayons, paper, notebooks, scissors, glue sticks, soccer balls, volleyballs, and other school supplies and sporting equipment.</p>
<p>Additionally, the people of Masai Mara are also in need of Band-Aids, deodorant, toothbrushes, toothpaste, and other toiletry items.</p>
<p>Our program is also affiliated with an orphanage that cares for children with AIDS, and we are asked to donate clothing (new or gently used) for infants, youth and adults.</p>
<p>With your assistance and monetary donations, I would like to provide the students and community of the Masai Mara with the basic necessities that we often take for granted. If you feel a connection with this cause, any amount of donation would be truly and greatly appreciated. <em>Every little bit helps.</em></p>

<h2 align=""center""><strong>UPDATE</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>After extensive consultations, we have decided to change our Indiegogo campaign approach. We now request our supporters to support these girls on yearly basis so that they can be able to closely monitor and evaluate their progress each year. We will carry out the same campaign once each year to let our supporters know of the girl's progress and requirements, and if there are new girls in need of assistance. We already have one more girl, Esther Kasisi whom we rescued over the weekend. Our supporters also have an option of personally sponsoring an individual girl at $140 each month and get to monitor and evaluate the girls through school progress reports, communicating directly with the girls through email or letters and quarterly updates about the girls from AMLI. </strong></h2>
<h2><strong>We now request supporters to help us reach $11,760 target in this campaign enough to take care of these girls for one year and we will be repeating this campaign once each year until these girls finishes their education.</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>Our grassroots education volunteers who are women, helps us to rescue these girls and the girls we have so far rescued are in AIC primary school { government owned} with boarding facilities, a fenced school save zone, a female matron who is in charge of them as well as security at all times to protect them. In liaison with the school management, AMLI closely monitors the girls and receives reports about them on weekly basis to ensure they are okay. Once a girl is rescued, they are protected by government law and no one can interfere with them while they are in school because they will be arrested. But schools need money to cover these girl’s expenses in school.</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>Help us reach our one year target of $11,760 NOW!!</strong></h2>

<h2>FACTS ABOUT GENDER INEQUALITY IN MAASAI LAND</h2>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 14.0pt;"">Like<span style="""">   </span>most poor women in African nations, Maasai Women are destined to live a life with limited choices. More than eighty percent of Maasai women will never have a single day of formal education. They will never learn to read or write or speak a language other than their native Maa. Not one in ten will reach the eighth grade. All but the most defiant will be “circumcised” at the age of twelve or thirteen and soon afterwards married to a man her father chooses. She will never be allowed to divorce, except in the most egregious cases of physical abuse, and will never be allowed to marry again, even if the husband her father chooses in an old man who dies when she is still in her teens. She will be one of her husband’s multiple wives, and will have many children, regardless of her health or ability to provide for them. She will rise early every day to milk cows, and spend<span style="""">  </span>her days walking miles to water holes to launder clothes and get water, and to gather wood to carry back home. If she is lucky, she will have a donkey to share her burden. She will live a life with few physical comforts, dependent on a husband and a family she did not choose.</span></p>

After extensive consultations, we have decided to change our Indiegogo campaign approach. We now request our supporters to support these girls on yearly basis so that they can be able to closely monitor and evaluate their progress each year. We will carry out the same campaign once each year to let our supporters know of the girl's progress and requirements, and if there are new girls in need of assistance. We already have one more girl, Esther Kasisi whom we rescued over the weekend. Our supporters also have an option of personally sponsoring an individual girl at $140 each month and get to monitor and evaluate the girls through school progress reports, communicating directly with the girls through email or letters and quarterly updates about the girls from AMLI. 
We now request supporters to help us reach $11,760 target in this campaign enough to take care of these girls for one year and we will be repeating this campaign once each year until these girls finishes their education.
Our grassroots education volunteers who are women, helps us to rescue these girls and the girls we have so far rescued are in AIC primary school { government owned} with boarding facilities, a fenced school save zone, a female matron who is in charge of them as well as security at all times to protect them. In liaison with the school management, AMLI closely monitors the girls and receives reports about them on weekly basis to ensure they are okay. Once a girl is rescued, they are protected by government law and no one can interfere with them while they are in school because they will be arrested. But schools need money to cover these girl’s expenses in school.
Help us reach our one year target of $11,760 NOW!!
 
 
FACTS ABOUT GENDER INEQUALITY IN MAASAI LAND
Like   most poor women in African nations, Maasai Women are destined to live a life with limited choices. More than eighty percent of Maasai women will never have a single day of formal education. They will never learn to read or write or speak a language other than their native Maa. Not one in ten will reach the eighth grade. All but the most defiant will be “circumcised” at the age of twelve or thirteen and soon afterwards married to a man her father chooses. She will never be allowed to divorce, except in the most egregious cases of physical abuse, and will never be allowed to marry again, even if the husband her father chooses in an old man who dies when she is still in her teens. She will be one of her husband’s multiple wives, and will have many children, regardless of her health or ability to provide for them. She will rise early every day to milk cows, and spend  her days walking miles to water holes to launder clothes and get water, and to gather wood to carry back home. If she is lucky, she will have a donkey to share her burden. She will live a life with few physical comforts, dependent on a husband and a family she did not choose.
 


PRISCILLA - ONE OF THE VICTIMS
Many cases like Priscilla’s take place each day in Maasai land and more girls are expected to run away from their homes. We keep our ears and eyes on the ground to help those who will require our assistance. Through your support, we will be able to mitigate this problem. However, Across Maasai Land Initiative {AMLI}is working on along term solution tot his problem by involving parents as part of the solution and making it easier for girls to get assistance whenever they need it. Our long term goal is to reach as many girls as possible across Maasai land in Kenya.


THE ORPHANS WITH PARENTS

There is no better way to describe Jackline, Ruth Moipa, Hellen, Esther, Abigail and Ruth Nasieku apart from “ORPHANS WITH PARENTS” Now that they have escaped from their homes, their parents will not support them with anything, and instead, they will wait for them to be stranded and return back home to be married. These girls are now effectively on their own and without supervision or even a roof over their heads, there is great risk of them becoming pregnant which will make them more vulnerable to abuse and neglect. It is only education that will save them from prostitution.
The cultural, economic and physical barriers that combine to deny education to Maasai girls in Kenya are numerous, and taken together, almost impossible for all but the most determined girls to overcome. The six girls below have passed their first huddle of running away from their homes, but the big challenge of being able to stay in school still stares on their faces. It is only through your support hat these girls will be able to overcome these challenges.
The six girls above still have two years in primary school, four years in high school an four years in University. To complete their first six years in both primary and high school, they need food, boarding fees which covers {bed, electricity, water, cooks, and watchman and matron monthly payments}, uniforms {dress, blouse, shoes, socks, panties, bikers etc}, Transportation, and personal school supplies like bathing and washing soaps, tooth paste, tooth brush, shoes polish, shoe brush, toilet paper, Vaseline, pens, exercise books and the most important sanitary towels.
Each girl will require $140.4 each month for the above expenses which adds to $10108.24 for the six years per each girl {in primary and high school only}. The grand total required to support these six girls for the six years is $60649.44. It is only through your support that this could be realized to save these innocent girls from being send back home to go through Priscilla’s experience.

<p>In 2002, when I established a community network to prevent child and youth involvement in violent conflict in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, I already knew from my own experience of that conflict as a displaced child over the previous 8 years that peacebuilding was the field where my contribution in my community and country was most needed. What I was still to know, and indeed started realizing after few years of community work, was that conflicts in our changing world are so complex and the needs of the affected people so challenging that passion, dedication and good intentions alone are often not enough to bring about the change we envision for our world. This has been a personal challenge for several years, a really disturbing challenge indeed.</p>
<p>It is an immense pleasure today to seek your support for the wonderful opportunity I currently have to meet that challenge and subsequently bring about a significant change in my community, personal and professional life as a young peace worker in the war-torn eastern Congo!</p>
<p><strong>The opportunity</strong></p>
<p>In late September 2012, I received news from Coventry University (UK) that I was admitted in their Masters of Art in Peacebuilding, a unique programme that draws from experiences of effective resolution of complex conflicts in several parts of the world during the past decades to train the next generation of peacebuilders. When I received these news, I immediately felt that this was the right opportunity for my passion and commitment for peacebuilding to get matched with the skills and tools I need in order to deliver more effective and durable community rebuilding and empowerment solutions. The masters programme lasts one-year and is delivered online for the great part, with two 3-day residential workshops on Coventry University’s campuses in the UK and Turkey. You can find more about the masters at: <a href=""http://wwwm.coventry.ac.uk/RESEARCHNET/CPRS/PROSPECTIVESTUDENTS/PEACEBUILDINGMA/Pages/OnlineMAinPeacebuilding.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://wwwm.coventry.ac.uk/RESEARCHNET/CPRS/PROSPECTIVESTUDENTS/PEACEBUILDINGMA/Pages/OnlineMAinPeacebuilding.aspx</a>. Upon completion of the programme, I will have increased my understanding of violent conflicts and of the processes involved in political and security reconstruction, socioeconomic reconstruction and justice and reconciliation.</p>
<p><strong>I need your help</strong> </p>
<p>I sought admission in that masters programme out of a deep need for self-improvement but I was not expecting things to go so fast and my admission to come immediately, without me having to save enough to prepare these studies.</p>
<p>The total cost for attending the programme is 14,580 $. With a partial scholarship from the UK-based Allan and Nesta Ferguson Trust covering part of it, I need 8,910 $ between now and May 2013 to cover half of the tuition fees and the costs of travel to the two residential workshops in 2013. This is a long way to go but my intuition refuses to give up! I am currently gearing up for months of savings during which achieving that big step forward in my personal and professional development journey will be at the top of my priorities. I expect my savings over the next six months to cover half of the remaining costs and I am seeking your support towards the other half ($ 4,500), which I need to pay this year in order for me to keep my scholarship from the Ferguson Trust and to have my place in the programme confirmed. My admission in the programme was in fact conditional upon payment of $ 3,300 tuition fees by November 5 and that is the decisive part of all the process.</p>
<p>Having never spoke publicly about matters of this kind, it is with a knot in my throat that I am writing this today, but the opportunity I have in front me is so life-changing that I hope you understand why I am taking that move. I believe that every step towards making that project successful will be the result of your help, and behind that, of the love, encouragement and support that I will know is backing me in that endeavor.</p>
<p><strong>How you can help</strong></p>
<p>Every donation (no matter the amount) is one more step towards making that happen, and so is any effort to pass the word around and invite others to join. I cannot think of a greater gratitude to your contribution in that campaign than my future total commitment to the cause I am seeking to advance by taking that masters course.</p>

<p>spt is a simple concept with powerful possibilities.  It is what it’s name implies:  a simple phishing toolkit.  It is an open source phishing education toolkit that aims to help in securing the mind as opposed to securing computers. Organizations spend billions of dollars annually in an effort to safeguard information systems, but spend little to nothing on the under trained and susceptible minds that operate these systems, thus rendering most technical protections instantly ineffective. A single targeted link is all it takes to bypass the most advanced security protections.

This tool rocks and the folks at PaulDotCom Security Weekly would like to say well done, so please keep up the good work.""

""By now, most folks have heard of phishing scams, and know to be on the lookout for fake PayPal and bank sign-ons. But what happens when your co-workers get a link to a site that looks just like the corporate intranet? Using the Simple Phishing Toolkit (SPT) you can find out.""
- Joe Brockmeier (ReadWriteWeb): Bait Your Users with the Simple Phishing Toolkit
""Derek and Will, the creators of the Spear Phishing Toolkit, had the exact same idea and have built a great tool that can be used in exactly this fashion. Create campaigns, email your users, and track who is clicking links in emails and entering credentials. These are the people who need a little more help with identifying the emails that are going to get them, and the company, into trouble. From there, you can build an extra training specifically designed for them that addresses the problems they may be seeing. You can also keep better eyes on your risky users for indicators of compromise.We recently implemented this type of interactive education at Go Daddy to help educate our users about the dangers of phishing and how to spot a phish… unbeknownst to them, of course. This exercise is helping us target the users who aren’t successfully avoiding a phish, with more education. It’s going to take some time to tell whether or not this program is truly successful. However, it’s better than letting the bad guys ramp-up their tactics and hoping that our users will be successful at avoiding the attack on their own.""

<h3>Mentorship</h3>
<p>I've learned that everyone has at least one thing in common...  We're all people looking to get by and provide for our families.</p>
<p>This is an old sugar mill on the island of St. Kitts.  Every thursday, high school kids who haven't done well in their classes work in this mechanic shop under Keith.  The goal is to teach them a skill and offer them a career opportunity.</p>
<p>These kids are good, hardworking kids who are motivated to learn this trade.  The building is in bad shape, but even so this group of folks does some amazing work.  There is little the lead mechanics can't do out of this facility.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What I'd like to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchase trainer vehicles and engines $2,500 x2</li>
<li>Tool organizing furniture, workbenches and duplicate tools for student use $1,500</li>
</ul>
<p>Donations of: </p>
<ul>
<li>$30+ will have their name painted on the trainer vehicle</li>
<li>$100+ will receive an emailed picture of your name and a personal thank you letter from a student</li>
<li>$2,500 Will have a trainer vehicle decorated in your honor</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are able to travel out to St. Kitts, we can welcome you as honored guests and show you around the island!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>These kids show up each week to learn a trade they can use to provide for themselves and their families.  Upgrading these facilities and providing some appropriate training materials could have a lifelong impact on these students.  They are doing the best with very limitied facilities and materials.</p>
<p>I am a U.S. combat veteran, trained as an aviation mechanic.  I have worked in state of the art facilities maintaining helicopters.  These kids have the capability to accomplish amazing things and become great mechanics.  Not only would improved infrastructure improve their education, but these facilities could improve their income potential by facilitating larger mechanical projects.</p>
<p>We are all human and hope to provide for ourselves and our families.  A little investment in this educational program will benefit a large number of families in St. Kitts.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We could use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multi-tools such as Gerbers</li>
<li>A new roof on this building</li>
<li>A hydraulic lift</li>
<li>Tools!</li>
<li>Engines, transmissions and other components to use as training aids.</li>

Imagine, in , they make their own.  During Hospice of Michigan’s three year partnership with St. Luke’s Hospice, we have provided medical supplies and equipment unavailable to hospice patients there. We’ve also helped to fund additional nurses and aides for disadvantaged and rural areas.

 
St. Luke’s Hospice is headquarted in , , a place that might remind you of  with its lights, bustling activity, premiere dining, and attractions.  St. Luke’s patients live miles outside of  in villages and towns that offer a stark contrast to the modern city. 40% of St. Luke’s patients are dying of AIDS and another 60% are in a terminal stage of cancer. They are cared for in homes with dirt floors with few beds, and families frequently lack adequate food, medical supplies, and even clean, safe water. 

 
Serving 800 patients a day, St. Luke’s Hospice’s team of nurses, physicians, and volunteers work to relieve pain and nausea, ease breathing problems, and educate and reassure patients and families so they know know what to expect as a disease progresses. Just as our staff at Hospice of  does for our patients. These angels bring peace, comfort, and even joy to the last weeks and days of a patient’s life. Care is expensive, and no patient is turned away. 

 

 
What We Need 
Help Hospice of  raise $10,000 to send a nurse and social worker to St. Luke’s Hospice for 10 days for a critical learning exchange program.

 
The cost of travel to St. Luke’s for our staff, Joan, a Registered Nurse and Fran, a licensed social worker, is $5,000 each. That makes a total of $10,000 for airfare, housing, and all travel expenses. While, in , Joan and Fran will learn more about the care offered by St. Luke’s and will share the latest studies about hospice and palliative care with St. Luke’s staff, helping them improve services for their patients. They will also bring back new ideas for our work in  as they learn from the experiences of the staff at St. Luke’s Hospice and patient families. The circumstances may differ but the goal remains the same: to bring dignity and comfort to people as they die.  

 
Every dollar contributed will go directly to the St. Luke’s Hospice fund. Every. Dollar.  Hospice of  will pay all administrative and other indirect costs. We believe that you will get us to our $10,000 goal! When we exceed our goal, Joan and Fran will be able to take more medical supplies with them to —you can do it!

 
If you are looking at this, you are a social media expert.  Help us get the word out—post us on your Facebook page, tweet about us, send us to your email address book.  Thank you!

 

 
What you get!
Seriously, think this one through—you or someone you love will benefit from hospice care someday. In the meantime, every dollar will go toward sending Joan and Fran to St. Luke’s so that the hospice in —and Hospice of Michigan—can improve life at its end, no matter where you live.

 
We look forward to keeping our supporters up to date on the trip and sharing photos and experiences from our clinicians while they travel to  via email, Facebook and Twitter.  Please continue to help us spread the word about this exciting collaboration.  Thank you!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

If you can't help with money then please share my page!  I also accept donations of school supplies.

<div> </div>
<div>In 2011, I had the amazing opportunity of traveling throughout SE Asia. The particular experience of Cambodia opened my eyes, my mind, and my heart to a group of people with determination and grit, a world I knew very little about, and a recent history that not only shocked me, but has forever changed me. After 2 years, I will go back to Cambodia to work with orphaned children with the hope of giving them some education, exposure, and the confidence to go out and reverse the fate that many cannot. Whitney Webb, one of my closest and dearest friends, has put together this trip. She volunteered at the organization, ACODO, a few years ago when she was traveling in SE Asia. ACODO is mainly an orphanage but they do educational outreach through the country and have hopes/plans to expand. The 76 kids living in the orphanage come from pretty awful backgrounds (the effects of the Cambodian genocide are far from gone and child sex trafficking is a huge issue in the region) BUT the orphanage is a very happy, safe, and positive place. <a href=""http://www.acodo.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.acodo.org/</a>.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>The Volunteer Work:</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Our plan is to volunteer for a week at the orphanage (both in Siem Reap and Phnom Penh), spending time with the kids, and running a day or two camp for the teens based on entrepreneurship and personal finance. As many of you know, for the past four years I lived in South Korea while working as an independent educator and traveling throughout Asia; Whitney was working and traveling in post conflict countries in Africa, primarily Rwanda, with a focus on micro-finance loans. We have both seen a lack of entrepreneurial drive and financial fluency overall with the children in developing countries. There are several organizations promoting entrepreneurship in young adults, but from our current work in the United States, we have seen the huge impact that these ideas make when planted in the minds of children and teens. It's easy for all of us to take for granted the mentors (parents, teachers) and inspiration we get from seeing everyday people do extraordinary things. These kids don't have that exposure, and we want to try this out by bringing in some local small business owners in various industries to talk to the kids. Since starting a business is much easier said than done, we want to introduce the concepts of savings, budgeting, and micro-loans to the teens as well. The plan is to work with a local micro-finance bank who can send a local representative to speak, and we'll work with them to create some basic curriculum for us to run. Regardless of if these kids start a business, we think the basic financial ideas will help them as they leave the orphanage for independent lives.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>The Specifics:</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>I am asking family, friends, friends of the family and the families of friends to help me out with the monetary portion of this venture. Not only will I be raising money for the orphanage and the cost of volunteering and running the camp, but also for the cost of the flight to get me out there: my goal is to raise $3,000.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Please feel free to email or call me with any questions or if you know anyone in Siem Reap who may want to help out or mentor the kids. And please pass along my info to any friends / family who may want to help or get involved with ACODO at some point.</div>

Going careless on vacation in Cameroon is Egoistic Tourism.
Going in charge of carrying a message of hope to the African children is a tourism of solidarity.
I will spend a month working in the orphanage of CAJEN created by Maman MAXI, a school teacher and an orphan herself.
CAJEN center, is welcoming orphans , from 3 to 17 years old, to enable them to follow education in a nearby public school in Douala suburb : It has been presented to me by my Cameroonian friend, herself raised with a European education and now working in Montreal, yet has not forgotten her wonderful country of origin.
Africa is not only a huge market and a huge exporter of basic produces and a rich field of valuable minerals ores. Africa was the cradle of European civilization.

To channel fund to educate our African young kids is the best insurance for our future.
 
Give 10-20-50 even 100 $CAD, I will deliver them directly to Maman MAXI hands.
Make a maximal gift to Maman MAXI and her children.
To give directly to the Center , is to be sure that your gifts will be spent usefully without overheads of NGOs.
To give directly is to give more, it is creating a personal and cultural  link, it is delivering a message of hope.
The children of Maman MAXI are extending their hands, thirsty to learn. Help them proceed from elementary towards higher education.

<p>Welcome to the Global Alliance for Entrepreneurship and Business Development (Global AEBD) Indiegogo page. We are a 501(c)3
 nonprofit organization dedicated to the vision that entrepreneurship is
 our most effective and powerful tool in the challenging fight against 
poverty, unemployment, and underemployment.</p>
<p>Global
 AEBD’s current primary focus is the developing world, and we are 
working on our first major international project. It is designed to 
benefit Central America, specifically the countries of Guatemala, 
Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua.</p>
<p>In
 Central America, 50% of the population (or 10 million people) still 
live in poverty. Of those who belong to the labor force, 50% are 
underemployed. These problems are strongly related to the fact that 80% 
of their micro, small and medium enterprises collapse in less 
than five years after being initiated. Such distressing conditions often
 ruin the lives of entire families and deteriorate already precarious 
social situations. </p>
<p>Consistent
 with recommendations of relevant studies and research, Global AEBD 
intends to deliver an innovative, participatory, and sustainable 
approach to the challenging task of enhancing both the number and 
longevity of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in the Central American region. </p>
<p>Our
 project’s banner is “Boosting Entrepreneurial Empowerment in Central 
America” (BEE). The program will bring together Central American and 
international organizations -- including prestigious educational 
institutions, business associations, and a large community of 
professionals -- concerned with improving entrepreneurial skills and 
generating opportunities in the region. BEE will simultaneously engage
 relevant people and organizations in a strong and systematic effort to 
foster entrepreneurship and management skills, and to continuously 
generate fresh avenues for MSMEs entrepreneurs to thrive.</p>
<p>Specifically, our Global AEBD BEE project will: </p>
<ol>
<li>Build and sustain a web-based entrepreneurial hub</li>
<li>Facilitate formal and informal entrepreneurship education programs for MSMEs with institutional partners </li>
<li>Enable mentoring and coaching by kind and seasoned entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs</li>
<li>Create fresh avenues for relevant peer-to-peer knowledge and information sharing</li>
<li>Provide fresh opportunities for international business-to-business networking</li>
</ol>
<p>In
 this manner, the BEE program will bring about several important direct 
benefits to prospective and current MSMEs entrepreneurs, notably, the reduction of risks associated with a lack of appropriate knowledge and connections for business startup and sustainability.</p>
<p>In
 addition to bringing the online hub to life, the Global AEBD team is 
outreaching potential operational partners both in Central America and 
in other parts of the world. This includes not just people and 
institutions concerned with entrepreneurial education, skill building 
and development, but also, and not less important, organizations -- such
 as regional telecenters -- who may help potential and current MSMEs 
entrepreneurs to improve their digital-literacy skills.  </p>
<p>We already have a number of positive responses from some prestigious institutions, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Universidad Americana in Nicaragua</li>
<li>George Mason University in the US</li>
<li>The Asociación Conexión al Desarrollo de El Salvador</li>
<li>The Universidad Thomas More in Nicaragua</li>
<li>The Latin American Consorcio Red de Educacion a Distancia (CREAD). </li>
</ul>
<p>Our
 current crowdfunding campaign focuses on resources that are very much 
needed to successfully complete our cutting-edge online hub. This 
platform will be based on Ruby-on-Rails -- a highly versatile, modern, 
powerful, and scalable web framework, which is used in well-known and 
robust sites, including Twitter. Following all relevant development 
stages, our Web 2.0 mobile-friendly website will include the components

 indicated above, generous and able volunteers are currently granting 
their valuable time and skills to build the BEE online hub, and to 
attract relevant program partners. Still, the success of our Global AEBD
 IT project requires financial resources in the amount of $120,000 to

interactive web-platform, including the execution of all development

Each year the students have produced over 20 or so videos per class. The problem has been that much of the classroom experience has been theoretical and the practical aspect has been done outside classes without a teacher.</p><p>One of my most successful projects with students was 'Silent Whispers':</p><p><br/></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/lc4YcYV6Q_Y"" width=""560""></iframe></div><p></p><p>The students worked on a range of scripts, then mashed them together to form the story seen above. They recorded the process as part of a short documentary, sharing what they experienced and how it effected their understanding of video production.</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/a8dKzU7qkXo"" width=""420""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p>Many of the students seen in the video have gone on to study Higher National Diplomas, Honors Degrees and even Masters Degree in Media Production. Several have come back to work on projects I have developed such as digital feature films, documentaries and short promotional videos.</p><p>
</p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/EKU8YzUhybc"" width=""560""></iframe></div>
Students learn at different paces and have different styles of learning. Classrooms can be boring as many want to get stuck into the practical side of the video courses. Many preferred to watch something on YouTube or play computer games, especially if the tutor is dealing with another student's problems.<p></p><p>Video tutorials allow students to learn what they want, and when they want. Whenever possible I would produce a video to help them learn a piece of software. However, with more demands for producing paperwork and ticking boxes, less and less time was available to produce the necessary video tutorials.</p><p>The problem I found with many video tutorials on-line was that they were not produced by experienced video professionals or educationalists, so often crucial pieces of information would get left out causing frustration.</p><p>YouTree.TV Limited is a small company set-up to produce on-line video courses, allowing me to mix together 30 years experience working in television and video production with 12 years experience, working in further education, teaching media production.</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/TqiuXlNYUZ4"" width=""560""></iframe></div><p></p><p></p>
<div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/JOllhHL4yBY"" width=""560""></iframe></div><p></p>
The first phase is to produce a series of twenty-two video tutorials demonstrating the basic principles of video production, using technology close at hand, such as mobile phone and compact cameras, with simple editing tools. This campaign is being launched to help complete the first series of video tutorials, of which two can be seen above.<br/><p></p>
The second phase is to produce a series of fifty video tutorials with more comprehensive information.
<p></p>
Alongside the video tutorials, I am working with media industry professionals and Creative Skillset in Northern Ireland to set up a five-day workshop that will help graduate students build skills for working in industry. This combination of on-line video tutorials and face-to-face practical workshops will help build a strong platform of blended-learning, initially in Northern Ireland, but eventually throughout the UK.

<br/><br/>Your help in raising fund in this first campaign, will allow me to complete the first 17 video tutorials which will include developing ideas, how to use a range of camera technologies, shooting techniques to build a story, transferring movies clips from camera to computer, editing techniques on both Mac and PC, and uploading onto the Internet.<br/><br/>With my experience in television and education, I have a wealth of material to share with passionate digital film-makers. Using video is an ideal platform to achieve this, allowing students to work at their own pace. This is also a shared experience and collaborators have an opportunity to suggest additional courses that YouTree.TV can produce after this set of videos are complete.<br/><br/><h3>Who is George Kingsnorth?</h3><p></p>
I studied for a Higher National Diploma in Film &amp; Television at Bournemouth and Poole College of Art &amp; Design between 1980 - 1983. By 1984, I was working in Manchester on animation and freelancing as an assistant film editor. Towards the end of that year I was employed by BBC Northern Ireland, assisting in the editing of 16mm film productions, both drama and documentary. By 1988, I was editing video productions for Anglia Television in Norwich, England. <br/><br/>With my young family, I moved back to Northern Ireland a year later to work freelance on a range of broadcast and corporate productions both on film and video.

Each year the students have produced over 20 or so videos per class. The problem has been that much of the classroom experience has been theoretical and the practical aspect has been done outside classes without a teacher.One of my most successful projects with students was 'Silent Whispers':The students worked on a range of scripts, then mashed them together to form the story seen above. They recorded the process as part of a short documentary, sharing what they experienced and how it effected their understanding of video production.Many of the students seen in the video have gone on to study Higher National Diplomas, Honors Degrees and even Masters Degree in Media Production. Several have come back to work on projects I have developed such as digital feature films, documentaries and short promotional videos.

Students learn at different paces and have different styles of learning. Classrooms can be boring as many want to get stuck into the practical side of the video courses. Many preferred to watch something on YouTube or play computer games, especially if the tutor is dealing with another student's problems.Video tutorials allow students to learn what they want, and when they want. Whenever possible I would produce a video to help them learn a piece of software. However, with more demands for producing paperwork and ticking boxes, less and less time was available to produce the necessary video tutorials.The problem I found with many video tutorials on-line was that they were not produced by experienced video professionals or educationalists, so often crucial pieces of information would get left out causing frustration.YouTree.TV Limited is a small company set-up to produce on-line video courses, allowing me to mix together 30 years experience working in television and video production with 12 years experience, working in further education, teaching media production.

The first phase is to produce a series of twenty-two video tutorials demonstrating the basic principles of video production, using technology close at hand, such as mobile phone and compact cameras, with simple editing tools. This campaign is being launched to help complete the first series of video tutorials, of which two can be seen above.
The second phase is to produce a series of fifty video tutorials with more comprehensive information.

Alongside the video tutorials, I am working with media industry professionals and Creative Skillset in Northern Ireland to set up a five-day workshop that will help graduate students build skills for working in industry. This combination of on-line video tutorials and face-to-face practical workshops will help build a strong platform of blended-learning, initially in Northern Ireland, but eventually throughout the UK.

Your help in raising fund in this first campaign, will allow me to complete the first 17 video tutorials which will include developing ideas, how to use a range of camera technologies, shooting techniques to build a story, transferring movies clips from camera to computer, editing techniques on both Mac and PC, and uploading onto the Internet.With my experience in television and education, I have a wealth of material to share with passionate digital film-makers. Using video is an ideal platform to achieve this, allowing students to work at their own pace. This is also a shared experience and collaborators have an opportunity to suggest additional courses that YouTree.TV can produce after this set of videos are complete.Who is George Kingsnorth?
I studied for a Higher National Diploma in Film & Television at Bournemouth and Poole College of Art & Design between 1980 - 1983. By 1984, I was working in Manchester on animation and freelancing as an assistant film editor. Towards the end of that year I was employed by BBC Northern Ireland, assisting in the editing of 16mm film productions, both drama and documentary. By 1988, I was editing video productions for Anglia Television in Norwich, England. With my young family, I moved back to Northern Ireland a year later to work freelance on a range of broadcast and corporate productions both on film and video.

<p>There has been much research on what it will take for a student to be successful in the 21st century.  We are currently clear that success will depend on specific life skills and specific competencies such as information literacy, technology literacy, creativity and innovation, critical thinking and problem solving, communication and collaboration, and more.  There is no second guessing what it will take to be successful....we KNOW.  And, we can do a better job of helping our digital kids be ready. </p>

Hi! I'm Stewart and I'm Taylor and we live inside your Emagine-Nation!  We love to play games and connect with our friends.  And, we love to learn.  That's the part that our parents like the most.  We're trying to raise money to complete the world of your Emagine-Nation.com so you can create, play, and have fun while you learn. 

What's Emagine-Nation.com?
 

It's a new virtual world where kids can play, earn rewards for learning, complete webquests, create an avatar and go to virtual school with that avatar.  
It's a virtual campus with classrooms, cafeteria, gym, offices, and even a bathroom.
It's a social networking site where kids can connect with friends from all over the world...in a safe and secure way.
It's a Campus Store with thousands of hand-selected products for kids, parents, and educators.

We need your help to bring the world of Emagine-Nation.com to life for kids and parents everywhere.


What We Need & What You Get (It's the adults talking now!)
We've been working on this project for 7 years.  We are almost done and ready to launch.  The last part of our development includes all the social networking features.  This is where the challenge is...completing the social networking development in a way that allows kids to create and connect safely and securely.   We need your help to complete this project by October 31st and launch it by Thanksgiving, 2013. 





Why is Emagine-Nation.com Different Than Other Virtual Worlds?

Because it's focus is having fun while you learn. 

It's a safe and secure browser with a kid-friendly search engine.
There's a Project Wizard Room where you can create any project using all the latest technology.  Have fun and get stuff done.
There's a library with virtual resources, A Novel Idea Book Club, and more.
There are classrooms, a reward room, and more rooms than you can emagine!
There's even a bathroom where you can write graffiti on the wall...and NOT get in trouble!  You can even share your wall with friends.






Why Does The World Need Emagine-Nation.com?

The cultural context of children, teens, and families is changing at an exponential rate, especially when it comes to technology.  These changes leave kids facing a host of unprecedented problems for which there is no model to navigate by....and, few ""every day"" adults that understand. Technological advancements are outpacing our knowledge and preparedness for these changes.  And, kids certainly aren't contemplating the effects of social media, social interaction, and cognitive development has on their lives.  That's our job.  And, how do we do that job if we don't understand these issues ourselves?  We look around to see who is forward-thinking enough to have at least posed the questions.  And, we have....for 7 years.
There has been much research on what it will take for a student to be successful in the 21st century.  We are currently clear that success will depend on specific life skills and specific competencies such as information literacy, technology literacy, creativity and innovation, critical thinking and problem solving, communication and collaboration, and more.  There is no second guessing what it will take to be successful....we KNOW.  And, we can do a better job of helping our digital kids be ready. 

We have spent 7 years designing an environment where kids can learn, engage, and create in a safe and secure way.  We have spent time analyzing the threats that kids face online.  We have engaged kids who are the real experts in this area and we have incorporated their experiences.  Now, we need to finish the development that involves the actual interraction between kids in and out of our world.  Kids will be able to create and engage in learning and sharing without parents having to worry about technological dangers that they may be facing.  We know what we need to do and it's a massive undertaking.  Now we need to develop it and incorporate it into the world of their Emagine-Nation.com.  Please help us bring this world to life by donating to the project.  THANK YOU for helping us help them.

How Can You Get Involved?

Bring your own Emagine-Nation to our world, and the Emagine-Nation of your child, and learn, play, and share.  Donating money will help us finish the social  networking development so that your kids can use their Emagine-Nation to create, earn rewards, update their status on their very own social networking wall and share with their friends around the world.
What do you get?

The knowledge that you've helped to finish a stunning virtual environment that focuses on learning in new and engaging ways.
The knowledge that your kids will learn in a game-like environment that captures their Emagine-Nation and keeps them wanting more.
The knowledge that you've provided your child with the latest 21st century technology tools that they need to get to the head of the class....in school and in life.





If you are a business...
We have a special offer for businesses that will allow you to not only take advantage of our crowdfunding opportunities and perks but also maintain a presence in the world of Emagine-Nation.com as a prominently displayed advertiser, sponsor, or partner.  Get in on the ground floor by contributing to our campaign and we will create a very special offer for in-world promotion.

And that’s all there is to it.  Help us help your child learn and play in fun while getting stuff done.  Help us to finish the development of this stunning virtual world so that they can enjoy the social networking features that brings the world to them.



Our Story



We are a team of licensed school psychologists, certified education specialists, licensed mental health professionals, and certified coaches.  We have worked with kids and families for over 30 years.  Seven years ago we asked ourselves a pivotal question - ""how can we leverage what we know and make it available beyond our local borders?""  We had a dream...and, that dream was that we could help to close the gap between what students need to learn with how they learn today - with multiple intelligences and literacies, using technology as a platform of collaboration and engagement with their own process.  Our dream was that, if students were provided the right environment, that their emaginations would catch fire and that they would re-engage in their own learning process because they were engaged in the technology tools they came pre-wired to use.  Our dream was that kids would co-create their own reality with adults and educators trained in the new educational and life landscape that the kids exist within.  The rules have changed and we need to be prepared by giving our kids the environment with which to navigate successfully. That's our dream and we are asking you to participate in that dream.

Although these universities do not have astrobiology programs they do have excellent marine biology and evolutionary biology programs, both of which easily serve as proxies for astrobiology for an undergraduate program, especially when considering the weird extremophiles that inhabit the least hospitable areas of our world.

I'm Iain Nolen-Weathington, American Whovian and astrobiologist-to-be. Because of these two interests and my inherent love of foreign culture, I want to go to the UK for university. Unfortunately, university of any sort is a ""wee bit"" expensive. My mother's office had a fire over a year ago, which more than halved our family income and she is only now getting back to full pay. Because of this, we went through our savings so I am going to need help. This is where you come in. Please help this Doctor meet other aliens - send me to uni!Why the UK?I want to go to the UK because I would get to experience a new culture and environment in an exceptional educational system. I have already been accepted to University of Glasgow, University of Edinburgh, University of Exeter, Aberystwyth University and University of Hull, all excellent universities that would give me a great start in my career. Although these universities do not have astrobiology programs they do have excellent marine biology and evolutionary biology programs, both of which easily serve as proxies for astrobiology for an undergraduate program, especially when considering the weird extremophiles that inhabit the least hospitable areas of our world. The UK is home to several astrobiology organizations including the UK Centre for Astrobiology and the Astrobiology Society of Britain. Also as a fan, the UK would be a wonderful place to explore. Seeing the very places that were featured (and invaded) in Doctor Who episodes would most certainly be an exciting experience. Even as an (American) alien, I am certain I would blend in at least as well as I do here with my bow tie and fez, because they are cool.How can we obtain our goal?The goal for this campaign is international tuition and room and board for either University of Glasgow, alma mater of Steven Moffat and home of Peter Capaldi, or University of Edinburgh, home of the UK Centre for Astrobiology.

</p><p>Dear family and friends,</p>
<p>Last year in March I traveled to southwestern Uganda to
volunteer with a new health care non-profit organization that Bill, my
boyfriend, co-founded and currently heads. During my three weeks in the dusty town
of Kabale which is just north of the Rwandan border, I worked with a team of 14
other volunteers – doctors, dentists and dental hygienists – to help run medical
and dental clinics. I specifically helped to run the mobile pharmacy with Bill’s
mom, working with local Ugandan nurses to fill prescriptions from 21 huge
hockey bags that we had stuffed with donated medications from basic pain
killers to reading glasses.</p>
<p>During one of the especially busy clinics which was held at
a local school called Muyumbu Primary School nestled in the lush hills of a valley
about an hour’s drive from Kabale, one of the local community leaders named Robert
(also known in the community as “Kukuru”) pulled me out and suggested that I go
speak to one of the classes. </p>
<p>I walked in and saw 70 school children jammed into a tiny classroom,
all bright-eyed and giddy. Robert then announced to me that they had prepared a
song for me. After his go-ahead, the whole class broke out into song, clapping
their hands and singing together with huge smiles on their faces. Afterwards,
Robert asked if I wanted to say a little something to them. I saw nothing but
happiness and hope on their faces, and I took a couple minutes to tell them
about the importance of studying and doing well in school, so that they’d have
the ability and the skillset to go off in the world and be whatever they wanted
to be. At the same time, my heart sunk looking around realizing that the school
itself was so strapped for educational resources and that most of these
children lived in utter poverty. </p>
<p>It was a sobering moment for me, thinking about how much my
brother Albert and I have been given growing up, and how we were afforded every
opportunity to make something for ourselves because of the sacrifices of our
parents. We were, and still are, so very lucky. And so grateful.</p>
<p>And so that brings me to the <b>core of this message</b> to you all
(sorry it took this long!). Albert will be going on the second annual trip with
<a href=""http://www.to-theworld.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">TO the WORLD</a> (the non-profit organization) back to Kabale, Uganda along with
Bill and 26 other doctors, nurses, dentists, dental hygienists, pharmacists,
and other volunteers in mid-February. Before he goes back, and I know there isn’t
too much time, he and I wanted to raise <b>$1000</b> to buy at least one laptop for
the Muyumbu Primary School, a school that serves 713 students, has 21 teachers,
and does not have any computers. NONE. </p>
<p>With one laptop (and I know it’s not much), the school
administration will be able to use this new property to store school information,
access internet in the rare case they are able to access wi-fi, and also help
print documents when they schoolmaster is able to make it into town.</p>
<p>Albert and I would be ever grateful if you could help us
raise this money – and it would mean so much more to the 713 students and 21
teachers that it will help.</p>
<p>Anything that you can donate would be appreciated, and thank

I have always had a passion for helping others and have decided to pursue a college degree that would allow me to further this passion. I truly believe in the notion  that we need to be the change we wish to see in the world. Therefore I took it upon myself to  pursue every opportunity I could to try to further my knowledge in order to better be able to help others. I was fortunate enough to be able to attend the Brown University Leadership Institute where I studied leadership and conflict resolution. I am also an alumni of the Congressional Youth Leadership Council where I had the opportunity to further develop my leadership skills and knowledge of development.</p>
<p>After being accepted to Clark University I began to study entrepreneurship. It is through my studies that I was introduced to the field of social entrepreneurship (SE). This exciting field seeks to remake the relationship between the public and private sector. In a nut-shell the idea behind SE is that we can make non-profit organizations more effective by making them more sustainable. This sustainability can be derived from applying market principles in the form of a product or service. The profits from that service or product can then be re-invested helping to sustain the non-profit cause in the long-term which increases its effectiveness. This emerging field will have major implications for the non-profit sector and has the potential to change the way the world addresses development on a global scale.</p>
<p> This funding will allow me to travel to Nairobi, Kenya with Clark University Dr. David Jordan to conduct research and to participate in the first ever Seven Hills Global Outreach International Conference. This conference will bring together social entrepreneurs  from around the world to exchange ideas, learn from one another and grow. As a student this is a once in a life-time opportunity and I am very excited about it. Being able to go on this trip is important to me because I will be able to pursue my academic passions that much further and will be able to see what I have been studying for the past several years first-hand. Not only will this provide me with first-hand field-experience, but I will also be able to meet with people and organizations that have a massive impact on our world today. Many of the organizations that will be present are helping to re-shape the way the international community addresses development and the non-profit sector. Having the opportunity to be a part of this process will help me to find my place in this emerging field and will ultimately help me to be the change I want to see in the world.</p></div>","My name is Dylan Sansone and I am a junior at Clark University in Worcester, MA.

<h2>Christmas Kindness</h2>
<h3>
<br/>The Cambodian Children's Shelter</h3>
<p>I recently volunteered at a children's shelter in Cambodia, called Les Restaurant des Enfants. Each day, this wonderful organisation in Phnom Penh provides over 100 children with meals, a shower and a safe place to stay. At the shelter, the children can receive basic hygiene and health care, have their hair cut and enjoy the unwavering support from the shelter's loving staff. By providing the children with life's basics, the shelter takes some of the financial strain  off the families and the children are then able to enjoy their young lives a little bit more.</p>
<p>All the children at the shelter are happy and polite, despite their own daily struggles. Some of the children are homeless and spend most of their time scouring the streets for cans, tying to sell odds and ends or begging. Many children have lost their parents to AIDS and other diseases. Others live in tiny rented rooms with their families, but they too have to work each day to support themselves and their loved ones.This Christmas you can make a difference by donating to Les Restaurant des Enfants.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Post-Session is a milestone of the ARISE High School experience. Students take three-week intensive courses related to arts, creativity, or physical education. As a teacher, it allows me to teach the passions I have beyond the discipline I teach everyday. For students, it allows them to explore beyond the traditional academic disciplines, to get out of the classroom, build community across grade levels, and cultivate new passions. Students who haven't always done well in Math or English find new confidence and competence when they can explore other strengths like drawing, painting, dancing, biking, or mountaineering. Post-Session culminates in an exhibition night in which each course presents what they did and learned to the community at large. You are welcome to join us to see the impact of your contributions.</p>
<p>Our course offerings this year are as follows:</p>
<p>ACTIVE RESISTANCE</p>
<p>Journey with us as we will find our Zen, strengthen our core, and learn healing strategies that speak truth to power.  <strong>Active Resistance</strong> will provide you with the tools to endure struggle on all fronts of your life, be it physical, mental, emotional and spiritual.  Participants will increase their physical strength through traditional Muay Thai Kick Boxing, boxing and yoga, find their center by practicing daily meditation and participating in a Native American sweat lodge ceremony, go on an overnight amongst California's serene coastline and explore what Hip Hop, health, and higher education have to do with resistance. </p>
<p><br/>I WANT TO RIDE MY BICYCLE!</p>
<p>We will bike the Bay Trail, the Headlands of Marin, Tennessee Valley, China Camp, and all over the East Bay. Students will learn bicycle safety, maintenance, and repair in addition to biking themselves into great shape. The course will culminate in a three-day overnight stay in the Marin Headlands. Trips for Kids will take us out mountain biking on trails in the surrounding area. Bikes!</p>
<p>REEL TO REAL: THE ROLE OF WOMEN IN FILM</p>
<p>We are going to watch films, examine them and then make them. We are going to spend the morning watching and analyzing and then spend the afternoon filming and making film--specifically focusing on female archetypes, gender roles, and feminist critiques in film.</p>
<p>HOMIES EMPOWERMENT</p>
<p>Students from the Homies Empowerment ""Adelante"" Leadership Program will embark on a 3-week journey throughout California learning their history from the change makers themselves. They will spend time in the home of UFW Leaders Cesar and Helen Chavez. Student will travel to Los Angeles to learn from leaders such as Father Gregory Boyle about Homeboy Industries.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, statewide budget cuts have gutted our funding for Post-Session and left us to raise the funds ourselves. Each course will receive $500, which means we need to raise $5500 to support the 11 course offerings. Each course spends the money a little differently, but it is generally used for transportation, supplies, and guest teachers. For instance, the bicycle course uses the money for bicycle parts, snacks, and lodging for the overnight trip. The film course uses the money for camcorders, props and transportation.</p>
As for perks, you will certainly receive kharmic bonus points, a sense of glory and accomplishment, and...most importantly...a thank you card from our students. If you give more than $100, we will list you on our program at the exhibition night for all the post-sessions. <br/><br/>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Over the past 6 years Post-Session has been offered, we've seen countless students discover their passions. Many students decide what they want to study after high school. And almost all students return to the classroom energized, more confident, and more ready to learn. Students also build relationships across the grade levels, with students who they don't have in their daily classes. This builds the familial, connected feeling of Arise High School.</p>
<p>Your contribution will help 250 students participate in post-session. It will enable students to receive the requisite Art and PE credit they need to graduate, while also exposing them to new topics, experiences, and modes of learning.</p>
<p><br/>The importance of intersession according to students:</p>
<p>""In Sports Around the Bay we got to go to parks all over the East Bay and play everything from basketball to ultimate frisbee. It allowed me to get out of my head and all the stress of my daily life. When we went camping, we could share with each other and really become friends with students we didn't know that well,"" Jennie.</p>
<p>""Post-session gives you three weeks where you don't have to stress about academics, but can focus on new experiences and making new friends. I loved spending three days in the Marin Headlands with the other students. We got to bond over some challenging bike rides and at night at the hostel. You just can't bond like this in the classroom,"" Eric.</p>
""I think post-session is great because I can connect with my teachers outside of the classroom. It helps us humanize one another,"" Maria.</div>

<div>""At first, I thought Mr. Damon was crazy for making us drink that green sludge (energy shakes). Then I tried one and it wasn't as disgusting as it looked at it made me feel great. After the class, it was funny to see kids walking down the hallway with those green shakes,"" Marco.</div>

Post-Session is a milestone of the ARISE High School experience. Students take three-week intensive courses related to arts, creativity, or physical education. As a teacher, it allows me to teach the passions I have beyond the discipline I teach everyday. For students, it allows them to explore beyond the traditional academic disciplines, to get out of the classroom, build community across grade levels, and cultivate new passions. Students who haven't always done well in Math or English find new confidence and competence when they can explore other strengths like drawing, painting, dancing, biking, or mountaineering. Post-Session culminates in an exhibition night in which each course presents what they did and learned to the community at large. You are welcome to join us to see the impact of your contributions.
Our course offerings this year are as follows:
ACTIVE RESISTANCE
Journey with us as we will find our Zen, strengthen our core, and learn healing strategies that speak truth to power.  Active Resistance will provide you with the tools to endure struggle on all fronts of your life, be it physical, mental, emotional and spiritual.  Participants will increase their physical strength through traditional Muay Thai Kick Boxing, boxing and yoga, find their center by practicing daily meditation and participating in a Native American sweat lodge ceremony, go on an overnight amongst California's serene coastline and explore what Hip Hop, health, and higher education have to do with resistance. 
I WANT TO RIDE MY BICYCLE!
We will bike the Bay Trail, the Headlands of Marin, Tennessee Valley, China Camp, and all over the East Bay. Students will learn bicycle safety, maintenance, and repair in addition to biking themselves into great shape. The course will culminate in a three-day overnight stay in the Marin Headlands. Trips for Kids will take us out mountain biking on trails in the surrounding area. Bikes!
REEL TO REAL: THE ROLE OF WOMEN IN FILM
We are going to watch films, examine them and then make them. We are going to spend the morning watching and analyzing and then spend the afternoon filming and making film--specifically focusing on female archetypes, gender roles, and feminist critiques in film.
HOMIES EMPOWERMENT
Students from the Homies Empowerment ""Adelante"" Leadership Program will embark on a 3-week journey throughout California learning their history from the change makers themselves. They will spend time in the home of UFW Leaders Cesar and Helen Chavez. Student will travel to Los Angeles to learn from leaders such as Father Gregory Boyle about Homeboy Industries.

<p>Real-World Training Solutions(R-WTS) has discovered that a majority of the police departments and sheriff’s offices in the United States do not have access to leading edge training technology, specifically use-of-force simulators.  City and county budgets are stretched thin and the funds needed to purchase this training technology, typically $30,000 to $150,000, are just not available.  R-WTS is helping solve this problem by purchasing these expensive systems and then renting them out to law enforcement agencies on a daily or weekly basis at a much lower rate that will fit into almost any agency’s budget.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p> <strong>Why is training on a simulator important? </strong></p>
<p>Simulators are great training tools because officers can Experience it before they live it!  Officers have the opportunity to work out techniques and tactics while life and limb are not on the line. Training on real-world situations and environments saves lives! Law enforcement officers that use leading edge training equipment work safer and reduce risk to themselves and the public. Using a use-of-force simulator helps officers build a mental rolodex… hopefully they will never find themselves in some of the situations you can put them in using a simulator (like active shooter in a school for example) but if they ever encounter this situation, or something similar, the time in the simulator will help them develop a quick and effective response. </p>
<p>The Marion Police Department <a href=""http://www.r-wts.com/testimonials.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">testimonial on the R-WTS</a> web site is a great example that you should check out.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What We Need  </strong></p>
<p>We need your help to purchase more of these life saving training tools.  By purchasing more systems we can help more agencies and their officers.  Currently we are constrained by a lack of funds to purchase additional systems becasue we price the rentals for affordabillity not profitability.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What are we going to do with the money?</strong></p>
<p>The funds we are seeking will be used to purchase more use-of-force simulators (laptop computer, high definition projector, portable screen 12 feet x 7 feet) and training weapons.  Each system needs the following specially modified training weapon: (2) Batons, (2) Pepper Spray Canisters, (2)Tasers, (4) handguns , (2) shotgun and (2) rifles.</p>
<p>If we exceed our goal, the additional funds will be applied toward the purchase of another system if we have enough. If not, funds will be applied toward maintenance and the purchase of additional weapons for the systems we currently have.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>How the system works:</strong></p>
<p>A use-of-force simulator is a computer based system that uses a high definition projector to project a video scenario on a 7’ x 12’ screen. Up to 4 officers, <a href=""http://www.r-wts.com/weapons"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">using specially modified weapons</a>, interact with the screen depending on how the scenario unfolds. The video scenarios have branching options meaning that the outcome can be different depending on the actions of the officers or the specific training need. For example, if an officer uses good verbal commands the on screen suspect can be made to comply with the officer’s request. The scenario can be rerun and the next time the verbal commands are ineffective and the suspect chooses to pull out a gun or attempts to assault the officer which causes the officer to react accordingly.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Unfortunately, awesome online content can't help these future Einsteins without a bit of creative intervention. That's where we, you, and our partners here in East Africa come in. Lack of knowledge about online learning tools, and the inability to afford to download data (especially video) are two of the largest hurdles, both of which Tunapanda is working to solve.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">We are two brothers in our mid-late 20s who believe that harnessing technology to spread education is key to creating the most awesome possible future. We've been incredibly lucky to live on 4 continents so far, and had access to great educations – and think everyone else should have such access as well. So we've started telling people in Kenya about the new free online learning tools and courses, downloading the ones we can, and distributing them for free. Kenya has state-funded education through 8<sup>th</sup> grade, so we focus on teenagers who can't afford to go to high school – there are hundreds of thousands here each year, and untold millions around the world. 25% of Kenyans in 8<sup>th</sup> grade don't continue to high school, and 40% of those finishing high school do not proceed to further education or training. There is also a <em>severe</em> shortage of teachers, particularly in the technology sector.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">We aren't limiting ourselves to East Africa, just starting here – we hope eventually our system, or something like it, can be deployed anywhere in the world, whether deep in the Congo or in any city in our home country.</p>

And while most people know about Facebook, hardly anyone knows that Khan Academy has the entire high school curriculum, or that they can learn computer programming from top professors for free on Udacity, Coursera, or edX. In rural Kenya it costs less to buy a DVD full of video than to pay for bandwidth to download it, and DVD players are more common than home computers – we're leveraging that fact to get around high internet costs.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">We also spread and teach free and open source software, and teach kids about upcoming technologies like 3D printing, so they can both start dreaming about changing the world, and actually start doing it. We work directly with students, but focus mainly on training teachers so they can spread it without needing us. Using free and open source software is more practical than philosophical – people can't afford half of their family's annual income for an operating system license, and while pirating is widespread we'd rather avoid risking going to jail or wasting time, energy, and money in legal battles.

<h3 class=""western"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>FYI: Tunapanda is a Swahili word meaning “we are planting,” “we are growing,” or “we are climbing.” It's not a fish-bear.</p>
<p>In our <span style=""font-style: normal;""><strong>Phase 1</strong></span>, which lasted the past 4 months, we partnered with 3 different organizations and became intimately familiar with the problems here. We've been using online learning resources to continue our own educations for at least 2.5 years, and have taken courses on at least 4 platforms, so we used that experience to spread the right knowledge and courses.</p>
<p>We need at least $25,000 for <strong>Phase 2</strong>, which we expect to last 4-6 months. At least half of all money raised will go to upgrades at our partners' schools, starting with TIIT – a technology school in rural Elburgon that uses 12-year-old computers and has a half-finished dorm that could allow them to accommodate 15-20 more students. You can see TIIT and hear from one of their co-founders in our video above.</p>
<p>The rest will go to setting up Tunapanda's central hub in Nairobi, where we'll bring local teachers and students for advanced training, work with people on the internet (like you, perhaps?) who want to help us out in our forums, get set up as a 501(c)(3) based in the US, pay for local legal &amp; visa fees, and begin spreading regionally. We've partnered with 3 groups, detailed on our website, and have 2-3 more in mind to begin working with soon. For example, the Duke-sponsored WISER school in a far-flung corner of Kenya teaches girls STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) skills but would like to put their computers to better use.</p>
<p>By the time <strong>Phase 3</strong><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> rolls around, we hope to have more reliable forms of funding, like committed donors and grants, as well as an easily-replicable hard drive with an easily-understood path to mastery in various subjects. Then we hope to do some really cool stuff, most of which will be copied from successful project all over the world, or which people who work with us either online or on the ground have come up with.</span></p>
<h3 class=""western"">Closing Remarks</h3>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">If you visit our website you can see more information about our management and directors, as well as a snapshot of what's in our “education on a hard drive.”</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">You can help at no cost by sharing this campaign however you see fit, or going to an online learning platform and taking some courses – which helps the content creators we spread improve their products.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">You can also go visit our forums and start sharing ideas, or meet people in your area who would like to join you in spreading all these great tools and courses to people who don't know about them or can't afford access.</p>

The rest will go to setting up Tunapanda's central hub in Nairobi, where we'll bring local teachers and students for advanced training, work with people on the internet (like you, perhaps?) who want to help us out in our forums, get set up as a 501(c)(3) based in the US, pay for local legal & visa fees, and begin spreading regionally. We've partnered with 3 groups, detailed on our website, and have 2-3 more in mind to begin working with soon. For example, the Duke-sponsored WISER school in a far-flung corner of Kenya teaches girls STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) skills but would like to put their computers to better use.
By the time Phase 3 rolls around, we hope to have more reliable forms of funding, like committed donors and grants, as well as an easily-replicable hard drive with an easily-understood path to mastery in various subjects. Then we hope to do some really cool stuff, most of which will be copied from successful project all over the world, or which people who work with us either online or on the ground have come up with.
Closing Remarks
If you visit our website you can see more information about our management and directors, as well as a snapshot of what's in our “education on a hard drive.”

<div>
<ul>
<li>$20 for a One Day pass</li>
<li>$80 for a pack of 5 One Day passes</li>

<div></div>
<div>We're going to aim for a minimum of 1-2 <b>free </b>classes every week, and 6 or more paid classes every week with an average cost of $30/class. Classes will sometimes have additional material fees.<br/>
</div>

</div>
<div>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>How will you support vulnerable and underrepresented members of our community?</b></p>
<p>Well, please forgive us for repeating ourselves a little bit from the question above, because as a non-profit we are very committed to reaching out and supporting ALL fiber artists and hobbyists, regardless of their ability to pay. We very much want to make sure we answer this question thoroughly!</p>
<p>We will have:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Senior Citizen discounts</li>
<li>Steep discounts for middle &amp; high school students</li>
<li>Discounts available to students of any age</li>
<li>Volunteer opportunities to work in exchange for free access</li>
<li>Grants available for people from low income families</li>
</ul>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Can a friend and I buy a monthly/yearly pass to share?</b></p>
<p>Monthly and yearly passes will be strictly digital, stored on our computers. To get in to use the tools, you will first set up an account. Every time thereafter you tell the front desk attendant your account number and PIN, or show your registration email (physical cards available upon request). If you don't mind sharing, we don't mind either, but only one person can use a membership account at a time.</p>
<br/>
</div>

<div><b>How and when will I get all my stuff?</b></div>
<div>The tote bag, cup, and bumper sticker from the Exclusive FABRIC Stuff pack will be mailed out starting Dec 14th, through the end of that week via USPS. We will be aiming to order those items around the middle of November, which is why that pack is limited in number. We'd like to see you get your stuff before the end of the third week of December, but of course we cannot make any guarantees on delivery once it is in the hands of USPS during its busiest time of year. If we hit the $125,000 stretch goal, the travel mugs will be ordered either at the same time, or as soon as possible, so that they all go out together.<br/><br/>
</div>
<div>All passes (day, class, month, year, etc.) will be sent out electronically starting December 10th. You must provide an email address where we can send your passes. NO passes will be physically mailed.<br/><br/>
</div>
<div>The embroidery tapestry will, understandably, take time to finish. We will email all backers when we start the tapestry, a progress update or two as we work, and a finished update.<br/><br/>
</div>
<div>The Grand Opening Eve invitation will be emailed to all backers. You will need to show it on a phone or tablet or print it out and show it at the door. Just as with the passes, you must provide an email address where we can send your invitation. NO invitations will be physically mailed.</div>
<div>
<br/><br/><b>What happens if you don't meet your goal?</b> <br/><br/>Please see the next question.<br/><br/>
</div>
<div><b>When do I get to use my passes? (AKA when does FABRIC open?)</b></div>
<div>If we successfully raise at least our minimum of $35,000, the Grand Opening will be between April 2016 and June 2016.<br/><br/>
</div>
<div>It'll take a number of months to find a suitable space, and then it'll take at least two months, maybe longer, to get the space clean and set up. It'll all depend on how fast we find the space, and then once we find it, what kind of shape it's in. We'll be sure to send you guys updates to let you know where we are as we start each new step.<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>If we don't hit our minimum, it'll depend. Lower than about $25,000 and we will have to wait to find space until we find grant funding to make up the rest of our budget, research time-share options, or other ways to reduce the location costs. Between $25,000 and $35,000 we can start sacrificing other goals (reduce the projected size of the tool library, be further from a T/bus stop than we'd like, etc.) and rent space on the same April/June timeline.<br/><br/><br/><b>I got a thank you letter from ""Boston Knit Out &amp; Crochet<span></span>"", who is that?<br/></b><br/>Boston Knit Out &amp; Crochet was Common Cod Fiber Guild's previous name.<b><br/><br/></b><span></span>

There are copyright challenges we may face as a media library with books, magazines, and other formats with patterns. Public libraries may buy these materials and lend them, and we should also be able to do so as an educational non-profit, but we may have to change how or what we offer in our ""traditional"" lending media library based on future copyright challenges. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Based on what insurance company we get our coverage through, we may have to restrict usage of some tools in the library, such as requiring a signed waiver before they can be used, or only allowing people over a certain age to use certain machines. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>And, of course, like every other for- and non-profit business out there, there is always a chance that some day we will have to close our doors. However, with a strong user base (that's you!) and a good number of volunteers (maybe also you?), we should always be able to keep on offering great working space, educational classes, and a vast array of fiber arts tools for you to use!

</div>
</div>
</div></div>","[Edited to add Dec 5th, 2015: The campaign is over, but still want to help? Check out our website! www.fiberartsboston.org]
We want to bring you
the most magical, legendary fiber arts tool library that ever existed. We want
to help build an awesome community space where anyone regardless of background
can make great art, or get started learning how. 
And, by the way, FABRIC is
fiscally sponsored by Common Cod Fiber Guild, a 501c3 non-profit.Thus, all donations to FABRIC via Common Cod
Fiber Guild are tax deductible, including all Indiegogo donations! 




 
But first, what ARE fiber arts?
Well, a list of example fiber art disciplines include, but is not limited to: sewing (which itself includes making costumes/cosplays, quilting, embroidering) knitting, crocheting, tatting, felting, spinning, weaving, and many, many others!


FABRIC's non-profit mission
To preserve fiber arts for the future through educational classes, a fiber arts library, and the promotion of past and current fiber artists. How are we going to do this? By creating a library of tools and equipment that our members may use at the library or borrow, lots of classes and workshops ranging from basic knitting to advanced corset making, and a traditional book/media library.




FABRIC will be a public space filled with necessary tools for fiber artists and hobbyists alike to create, collaborate, and learn. The goal of this Indiegogo campaign is to raise enough money to rent a space for FABRIC and cover operation costs for one year. Our very first priority is to offer space, and every penny thereafter is a whole other story!

All the family is now with hands tied - hoping for a miracle to come and to raise the necessary amount.      It is one of hundreds of the desperate cases, and unfortunately true, it deserves to make an effort to provide some of what little we have, in trying to give him a hope for life.      We come with a request for help and want to thank you very much in advance for your support!       Any amount, no matter how small, can make the difference between despair and hope.Beneficiary in Moldova: Doinița Leahu

starts with passionate people. By training we are PhD chemists, 
biomedical engineers, published scientists, educators and community 
mentors. We LOVE what we do. It is time to get out of our university 
labs and share our passion for science, technology, art and history with
 the community that needs us most - our own. </p><h3>TOPS spreads innovation and education</h3><p>This
 campaign was started to help fund and grow TOPS, a nonprofit education 
program  for underprivileged high school students near the University of
 North Carolina.  Our purpose is to supplement the STEAM (science, 
technology, engineering, art and math) currently taught in middle and 
high schools in North Carolina. Our mission is to empower students to 
attend college and pursue their dreams  by providing exposure to real 
research labs, interactive learning experiences and opportunities 
related to STEAM , which encourages science education and cultivates a 
passion for learning. <b>We do this through tours of research labs, 
hands-on experiments, tours of campus, and partnerships with prominent 
professors and athletes at UNC. </b></p><h3>TOPS provides valuable opportunities at no cost </h3><p>TOPS hosts 8 day-long science and art themed programs each year 
for high school and middle school students from under served areas of 
North Carolina. We offer topics such as polymer synthesis, solar fuel 
cells, neuroscience, programming apps for smartphones, marine biology, 
robotics, art conservation, and other areas that inspire our 
participants.  <b>We feel one of the strongest aspects of our program is
 our ability to immerse participants in accessible, fun research 
opportunities that are usually only available at the PhD level or on a 
college campus</b>. Students will see, touch and experience what science is all about and learn that higher education is for everyone. </p><p>Although
 the over-arching theme for TOPS is biology and engineering-based 
science, with additional funding our weekend programs will also 
incorporate other sciences, art, drama, reading and writing into our 
classes. </p><h3>TOPS is growing</h3><p>Providing participants with realistic and relateable role models
 has been critical to the success of our program, and for this reason 
we've partnered with UNC athletics.  UNC basketball, baseball or soccer 
players stop by, lead a tour and talk to the kids about college. </p><p>We
 have had great success working with 6-12th grade teachers and students 
throughout the Chapel Hill, Durham and Raleigh areas. But to have a greater impact and
 provide the best programs, we need to enrich our program base and 
expand our reach.<b> Our main goal for 2015 is to reach 500 students, with each TOPS event featuring a different branch of science and 
an athlete sponsor.</b> Our program currently focuses on the basics of 
microscopy, growing cells, natural optics, synthesizing polymers, and 
more - but with your support we host a more diverse range of topics, 
provide academic and service scholarships for our participants, and 
spread our reach to Duke and North Carolina State University. The 
more funding we have, the more money we can give to TOPS offshoot 
programs and cutting edge experiments! Students who graduate from our 
program by attending at least half of our eight programs will also have 
the opportunity to become a Junior TOPS scholar and become a mentor for a
 group of younger students.</p><br/><h3>What we need and how the money will be spent</h3><p><b>All TOPS programs to date have been funded out of pocket by our founders (Emilie and Asad) or by small private donations.</b> <b>To expand TOPS and provide consistently cutting edge experiences to 500 students in 2015, our goal is to raise $2.500.</b>
 We have spent a lot of time thinking and talking about where our funds 
will be spent, and now is the time to put our plan into action. <b>Most

<div>Nevertheless, we believe that <i>knowledge is priceless</i> and everyone who asks for it should get it. Abilities and willingness to learn should be the only factors determining selection of students, not the country of one's birth. We do not understand, why International students have to pay two or three times more then us, Home/EU students, for the same amount of information. Why <i>ianula</i>, one of the most hard-working students in the university and extremely talented artist, should leave the university and stop learning just because she was born in another country?  Politicians talk about democracy and equal rights, but we see that society still cannot get out of hierarchical way of thinking. <i>We do not choose where to be born</i>,  but choose where to study and where to grow up as individuals and that is more important, these are real decisions that need to be supported. There should be <i>no discrimination in education</i>.</div>

<p><span>Greetings! We are Samba Fogo, a cultural arts organization based in Salt Lake City, Utah.  We present high-quality concerts, performances, and educational opportunities in Brazilian cultural arts.</span></p>
<p>This is an exciting time for Samba Fogo.  We are finishing up a busy year of workshops, concerts and community events.  Our 2014 &amp; 2015 summer youth workshop, <i>Samba Criança </i>(<i>Samba Kid</i>), were a rousing success, as was our spring concert, <i>Fogo Divino</i>. We also presented our second music and dance concert geared toward youth, <i>Axé</i>, which received great audience support and feedback.</p>
<p>In addition to performing, Samba Fogo also has a long history of presenting guest classes and arts residencies in local schools and after-school programs. These endeavors have always proved very successful and we consistently receive great feedback from participating teachers and students.  <br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What We Are Going To Do</h3>
<p>Our next endeavor is to support and grow our educational programming for youth.  </p>
<p>We were thrilled with the success of our summer youth program, <i>Samba Criança (Samba Kid)</i> this year (2015).  38 students, ages 5-14, participated in the workshop and engaged together in Brazilian drumming, dance, song, storytelling and craft making. We received extremely positive feedback from students and families who participated. Many talked about the quality of the program, and the profound impact it had on the students: how they couldn’t stop talking about it and singing the songs, practicing the dances, and even creating drawings of the stories at home. In just two hours per day for one week, we managed to create a fun and meaningful experience for the participants that will last a lifetime.</p>
As summer continues &amp; fall approaches, we are well into planning and seeking diverse funding for our 2015/2016 season. We will also be expanding our educational outreach efforts this fall, with a goal to offer more arts residencies and guest classes in local elementary, junior high, and high schools.  We hope this Indiegogo campaign will help us reach students and schools who would otherwise not be able to engage in our programming due to budgetary limitations. <p></p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>

</div></div>","Who We Are & What We Do 
Greetings! We are Samba Fogo, a cultural arts organization based in Salt Lake City, Utah.  We present high-quality concerts, performances, and educational opportunities in Brazilian cultural arts.
This is an exciting time for Samba Fogo.  We are finishing up a busy year of workshops, concerts and community events.  Our 2014 & 2015 summer youth workshop, Samba Criança (Samba Kid), were a rousing success, as was our spring concert, Fogo Divino. We also presented our second music and dance concert geared toward youth, Axé, which received great audience support and feedback.
In addition to performing, Samba Fogo also has a long history of presenting guest classes and arts residencies in local schools and after-school programs. These endeavors have always proved very successful and we consistently receive great feedback from participating teachers and students.  


What We Are Going To Do
Our next endeavor is to support and grow our educational programming for youth.  
We were thrilled with the success of our summer youth program, Samba Criança (Samba Kid) this year (2015).  38 students, ages 5-14, participated in the workshop and engaged together in Brazilian drumming, dance, song, storytelling and craft making. We received extremely positive feedback from students and families who participated. Many talked about the quality of the program, and the profound impact it had on the students: how they couldn’t stop talking about it and singing the songs, practicing the dances, and even creating drawings of the stories at home. In just two hours per day for one week, we managed to create a fun and meaningful experience for the participants that will last a lifetime.
As summer continues & fall approaches, we are well into planning and seeking diverse funding for our 2015/2016 season. We will also be expanding our educational outreach efforts this fall, with a goal to offer more arts residencies and guest classes in local elementary, junior high, and high schools.  We hope this Indiegogo campaign will help us reach students and schools who would otherwise not be able to engage in our programming due to budgetary limitations.    
What We Need & What You Get 

Donate to the cause:  Any amount is appreciated
Studio rental fees, drum equipment, transportation costs, outreach and promotional materials, and instructor fees all accumulate to keep programming costs chasing right behind program income and support.  “Donate to the cause,” and help Samba Fogo continue to present and expand our educational outreach in schools.

Sponsor a Samba Fogo guest class:  $200
This will help cover the costs of one guest drum and dance class at a local school or after-school program.
Sponsor a Samba Fogo cultural arts residency
Samba Fogo’s music and dance residencies in schools are always a blast - students learn in rhythm together while expanding their cultural understanding. Residencies culminate in a final performance for fellow students, friends or family members
Sponsor a 10-hour residency  $1,800
Sponsor a 20-hour residency  $3,500
Sponsor a 30-hour residency  $5,000

<h3>Diventa un fuoriclasse del Barbecue</h3>
<p>Gianfranco Lo Cascio è uno dei padri del movimento del Barbecue Italiano. È Brand Ambassador di Weber Stephen Italia, CEO di BBQ4All, fondatore della BBQ4All University ed ha contribuito, in qualità di coordinatore didattico, alla fase di startup delle Grill Academy by Weber in Italia.</p>
<p>La BBQ4All University è la sua scuola di cucina alla griglia, che raccoglie le tecniche delle variegate culture gastronomiche di tutto il mondo e le unisce alla forte identità gastronomica italiana. La BBQ4All University, dal 2012, ha finalizzato centinaia di corsi in 10 regioni d'Italia e consegnato oltre 10.000 attestati di partecipazione ad altrettanti entusiasti frequentatori.</p>
<h3>Scopri il progetto</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485534172/jdndkzut18jpwne7835o.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>La Masterclass è un percorso di formazione in video destinato a chi vuole alzare l'asticella e imparare tutte le tecniche e i segreti della cottura al barbecue,quelle che Lo Cascio e i suoi Coach hanno perfezionato nei loro 5 anni di attività. </p>
<p>La Masterclass è composta da due moduli didattici: Il modulo Grill to Perfection e il modulo Smoke to Perfection.</p>
<h2>Il programma dei corsi</h2>
<p>Barbecue e Grill sono termini considerati sinonimi nel nostro Paese, ma in realtà sono due filosofie di cottura che non hanno molto in comune. Durante i corsi, ti introdurremo pian piano nel mondo delle cotture sul fuoco,per insegnarti a conoscere a fondo i principi che regolano la cucina outdoor.</p>
<p>Partecipare ad un corso Grill to Perfection signica entrare in contatto diretto con i Coach di BBQ4All, i professionisti fra più autorevoli e preparati del panorama italiano. Potrai vivere da protagonista il trasferimento delle informazioni mentre ci si diverte, si griglia insieme per molte ore e si mangia ciò che si prepara.<br/>Cucineremo sui barbecue Weber Stephen, leader del mercato mondiale che produce la gamma più performante di barbecue, grill e accessori. Una perfetta combinazione tra grandi prestazioni, durata nel tempo e design.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485534343/ufkmlzhfmwxhovstf3qu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Grill to Perfection</h3>
<p>Il modulo Grill to Perfection è la serie di corsi che svela le vere basi del grilling, il compendio di tecniche di cottura in cui piccoli pezzi di carne sono cotti ad alta temperatura e per poco tempo; categoria in cui rientra <u><strong>anche</strong></u> la classica grigliata che conosciamo.</p>
<p>È composto da tre corsi: basico, intermedio e avanzato, e copre la totalità delle tecniche fondamentali che vanno dalla semplice accensione del carbone, alle più profonde criticità delle cotture dirette per irraggiamento, indirette per convenzione e ibride, che altro non sono che una sapiente miscela delle precedenti.</p>
<p>Il modulo <strong>Grill to Perfection</strong> è suddiviso in tre livelli, ognuno dei quali si focalizzerà su un particolare macro aspetto delle possibili tecniche da utilizzare. Ad ogni livello ti proporremo delle ricette-non-ricette, una sorta di preparazione gastronomica che, senza perdere il minimo appeal in termini di gusto, rappresenta un “pretesto” per insegnarti una tecnica, dimostrarti le criticità a cui si può andare incontro, gestire ogni imprevisto possibile e arrivare al risultato perfetto. Potrai applicare ognuna di queste tecniche a casa, con calma, e colpire i tuoi ospiti in un modo che neppure immagini.<br/>Questa serie di video corsi rappresenta la chiave per il successo indiscusso della tua cucina outdoor. E’ una promessa che ci impegniamo a mantenere.</p>
<p>Questo modulo formativo ti permetterà di acquisire le basi della cottura sul fuoco e ti accompagnerà, passo passo, nella gestione completa del dispositivo di cottura, che saprai utilizzare alla perfezione sia per le cotture dirette, per quelle indirette e quelle ibride. Il programma dei tre corsi è completo ed incredibilmente dettagliato.</p>
<p>La serie di video-corsi <strong>Grill to Perfection</strong> prevede tre corsi distinti ed indipendenti di 2 ore ciascuno:</p>

<ul><li>
<strong>Level 2</strong>: dedicato alle preparazioni dei tagli tenaci del manzo e del maiale</li></ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485536473/gpp5rwyrhasb4bbuwzxk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Nel Secondo Livello, parleremo dell’anatomia dello stinco di Manzo e maiale e della spalla di quest'ultimo. Approfondiremo la gelificazione del collagene testando lo sfilacciamento di un muscolo di manzo con il <strong>Pepper Stout Beef</strong>, e della spalla del maiale per un leggendario <strong>Pulled Pork </strong>nel puro stile di Lexington. Cuoceremo poi lo «<strong>Schweinshaxe</strong>», l'inossidabile <strong>stinco di maiale</strong> in stile <strong>bavarese</strong></p>
<p><strong>Obiettivi del corso 2 SMOKE TO PERFECTION - LEVEL TWO</strong><br/>In questo secondo livello, se sei un principiante del mondo del barbecue low and slow, ti faremo raggiungere 6 chiari obiettivi. </p>

<strong>Level 3</strong>: dedicato a due icone del barbecue texano: Brisket &amp; Beef Ribs</li></ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485538275/l4th0ddzzz4q4xesebp1.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Il terzo livello svela tutte le criticità legate alle due preparazioni più complesse del vero barbecue americano: le <strong>short ribs</strong> e il <strong>brisket</strong>, rispettivamente le costolette e la punta di petto del manzo.</p>
<p>Le vere icone del Barbecue nello stile del Texas. </p>
<p>Sono mattoni di fibre bovine incredibilmente tenaci e difficili da cuocere. A differenza delle tecniche usate nel secondo livello, la finestra di cottura ideale è minima, perché lo sfaldamento del connettivo deve avvenire in modo millimetrico e controllato. Sufficiente a rendere il taglio tenero,ma non così sfaldato da impedire il mantenimento della struttura delle fette. L'ultima sfida prima di diventare un Grill Master completo.</p>
<p><strong>Obiettivi del corso 3 SMOKE TO PERFECTION - LEVEL THREE</strong><br/>In questo ultimo livello della Masterclass, se sei un neofita del mondo del barbecue low and slow, ti faremo raggiungere 7 chiari obiettivi. </p>
<ol>
<li>Conoscere l’anatomia del costato di Manzo.</li>
<li>Conoscere l'anatomia della punta di petto di manzo.</li>
<li>Come sciogliere il tessuto connettivo in gelatina con le cotture lunghe.</li>
<li>Costruire un rub Texas Style.</li>
<li>Come individuare la ""small window"" di cottura ideale.</li>
<li>Introduzione al fenomeno dello stallo e soluzioni.</li>
<li>Come si fa: Texas Beef Ribs e Brisket.</li>

<h3>Steak House Secrets - Il modulo per i Professionisti che vogliono aumentare il fatturato.</h3>
<p>Visto il raggiungimento del goal, abbiamo aggiunto al progetto un altro modulo didattico composto da tre corsi. Sono corsi più specifici e di livello avanzato in cui daremo per scontate molte nozioni apprese nei moduli precedenti.<br/><br/>Il modulo si chiama «<strong>Steak House Secrets</strong>» ed i tre corsi che lo compongono riguardano <strong>la bistecca, l’hamburger e il pastrami perfetto.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486896767/v9krm24hydltw9srdkxt.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Nel corso sulla bistecca perfetta</strong>,<br/>prenderemo in esame tantissimi tagli, molti dei quali ancora sconosciuti in Italia ma che riscuotono un successo incredibile nelle steakhouse della grande mela:<strong> Hanger Steak, Flat Iron Steak, Denver Steak, Zabuton, Vegas Strip, Teres Mayor, Skirt Steak, Flap Steak, Flank Steak e molti altri</strong>. Sarà un viaggio nella comprensione dei tagli anatomici, delle varie espressioni di sapore, delle tecniche per massimizzare il gusto, passando per tutte quelle malizie che consentono di allargare l’orizzonte dei mattoncini di bovino cotti sulla griglia.</p>
<p>Se sei ancora convinto che la bistecca sia solo la costata con l’osso, questo corso ti darà una visione globale ed esaustiva di tutto l’insieme. L’approccio sarà, al solito, scientifico, riproducibile e scalabile a seconda delle diverse esigenze individuali.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486897106/bl61uryqok4op92nshhf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Nel corso sull’hamburger perfetto</strong>,<br/>prenderemo in esame il “protocollo” di costruzione di un hamburger perfettamente bilanciato. Questa preparazione smette di essere una polpetta tra due pezzi di pane e diventa un’alchimia di elementi e sapori stratificati e perfettamente equalizzata sulla scala dell’eccellenza gustativa.</p>
<p>Non sarà solo una serie di ricette alternative, ma un metodo che consente di individuare e fissare le regole di costruzione di infinite ricette. Dalla sintassi dei singoli elementi che lo compongono quali topping, insalate e salse, fino alla semantica delle varie consistenze reologiche degli ingredienti che si sposano nel morso. Per essere molto chiari: non solo una dettagliata lista di cose da fare, ma una rivoluzione in cui rimetterà in discussione ogni certezza.</p>
<p>Pensa che abbiamo già iniziato ad interrogarci sull’altezza perfetta di un hamburger da mordere senza andare in iper-estensione mandibolare (azione che sposta la zona di comfort verso l’imbarazzo quando mangiamo davanti ad altri) pur mantenendo coerenza di espressione gustativa dal primo all’ultimo morso. Un hamburger, appunto, perfetto.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486897407/rvwakvyuhxdqgibgurbl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Nel corso sul Pastrami perfetto</strong>,<br/>Prenderemo in esame la preparazione più ambiziosa mai pensata per la carne bovina. Il Pastrami è un salume cotto, a base di punta di petto di manzo, che viene prima conciato, poi fermentato, affumicato, stufato e tagliato a fette, che vengono infine impilate in modo generoso in un morbido sandwich.</p>
<p>Il pastrami fa impazzire tutti ed è molto costoso proprio perché estremamente difficile da produrre. In italia non ha ancora trovato larga diffusione proprio per le difficoltà connesse alla sua realizzazione. In questo corso ci impegneremo a spiegarti tutte le criticità della preparazione puntando al risultato perfetto.</p>
<p>Come anticipato, questi tre corsi sono rivolti ad un’utenza più smaliziata e consapevole. Di certo, molti professionisti potranno beneficiare di questi corsi per aggiornare la proposta sul menù e finalmente riempire una domanda sempre crescente, che non trova un’offerta altrettanto valida. Gli amatori potranno invece passare al livello successivo, dove l’espressione del mondo della cottura sul fuoco assume tutti i contorni di una cucina gourmet e ricercata.</p>

Scopri il progetto

La Masterclass è un percorso di formazione in video destinato a chi vuole alzare l'asticella e imparare tutte le tecniche e i segreti della cottura al barbecue,quelle che Lo Cascio e i suoi Coach hanno perfezionato nei loro 5 anni di attività. 
La Masterclass è composta da due moduli didattici: Il modulo Grill to Perfection e il modulo Smoke to Perfection.
Il programma dei corsi
Barbecue e Grill sono termini considerati sinonimi nel nostro Paese, ma in realtà sono due filosofie di cottura che non hanno molto in comune. Durante i corsi, ti introdurremo pian piano nel mondo delle cotture sul fuoco,per insegnarti a conoscere a fondo i principi che regolano la cucina outdoor.
Partecipare ad un corso Grill to Perfection signica entrare in contatto diretto con i Coach di BBQ4All, i professionisti fra più autorevoli e preparati del panorama italiano. Potrai vivere da protagonista il trasferimento delle informazioni mentre ci si diverte, si griglia insieme per molte ore e si mangia ciò che si prepara.Cucineremo sui barbecue Weber Stephen, leader del mercato mondiale che produce la gamma più performante di barbecue, grill e accessori. Una perfetta combinazione tra grandi prestazioni, durata nel tempo e design.

Grill to Perfection
Il modulo Grill to Perfection è la serie di corsi che svela le vere basi del grilling, il compendio di tecniche di cottura in cui piccoli pezzi di carne sono cotti ad alta temperatura e per poco tempo; categoria in cui rientra anche la classica grigliata che conosciamo.
È composto da tre corsi: basico, intermedio e avanzato, e copre la totalità delle tecniche fondamentali che vanno dalla semplice accensione del carbone, alle più profonde criticità delle cotture dirette per irraggiamento, indirette per convenzione e ibride, che altro non sono che una sapiente miscela delle precedenti.
Il modulo Grill to Perfection è suddiviso in tre livelli, ognuno dei quali si focalizzerà su un particolare macro aspetto delle possibili tecniche da utilizzare. Ad ogni livello ti proporremo delle ricette-non-ricette, una sorta di preparazione gastronomica che, senza perdere il minimo appeal in termini di gusto, rappresenta un “pretesto” per insegnarti una tecnica, dimostrarti le criticità a cui si può andare incontro, gestire ogni imprevisto possibile e arrivare al risultato perfetto. Potrai applicare ognuna di queste tecniche a casa, con calma, e colpire i tuoi ospiti in un modo che neppure immagini.Questa serie di video corsi rappresenta la chiave per il successo indiscusso della tua cucina outdoor. E’ una promessa che ci impegniamo a mantenere.
Questo modulo formativo ti permetterà di acquisire le basi della cottura sul fuoco e ti accompagnerà, passo passo, nella gestione completa del dispositivo di cottura, che saprai utilizzare alla perfezione sia per le cotture dirette, per quelle indirette e quelle ibride. Il programma dei tre corsi è completo ed incredibilmente dettagliato.
La serie di video-corsi Grill to Perfection prevede tre corsi distinti ed indipendenti di 2 ore ciascuno:

Level 1: dedicato al corretto approccio alla cottura diretta;

Il “Level 1” ti fornirà una panoramica delle principali categorie di cottura a fuoco vivo, i fondamenti delle cotture dirette, un imprinting sulle reazioni di cauterizzazione e sulle variabili che le governano, un approccio agli strumenti di seasoning (aromatizzazione) e all’ember roasting (cottura nella cenere) .

Smoke to Perfection
Il modulo Smoke to Perfection è rivolto a chi è diventato un Grill Master completo e possiede il pieno controllo del suo dispositivo, sia nelle cotture dirette che indirette.
Il prossimo livello è il Barbecue in purezza: il Low & Slow.
Grazie al modulo Smoke to Perfection potrai imparare i segreti della cottura lenta e a bassa temperatura made in USA. Il percorso didattico è stato suddiviso in 3 livelli della durata di 2 ore ciascuno.

Level 1: dedicato alle preparazioni dei tagli di maiale;

Nel Primo Livello parleremo della storia del barbecue, approfondiremo l’anatomia del maiale e la gelatinizzazione del collagene, affronteremo la preparazione delle Pork Ribs, del rub, della salsa di finitura e del Pulled Pork, utilizzando la tecnica di cottura soprannominata Minion Method. 
Obiettivi del corso 1 SMOKE TO PERFECTION - LEVEL ONEIn questo primo livello, se sei un esordiente del mondo del barbecue, ti faremo raggiungere 9 chiari obiettivi.

Approfondiremo la gelificazione del collagene testando lo sfilacciamento di un muscolo di manzo con il Pepper Stout Beef, e della spalla del maiale per un leggendario Pulled Pork nel puro stile di Lexington. Cuoceremo poi lo «Schweinshaxe», l'inossidabile stinco di maiale in stile bavarese
Obiettivi del corso 2 SMOKE TO PERFECTION - LEVEL TWOIn questo secondo livello, se sei un principiante del mondo del barbecue low and slow, ti faremo raggiungere 6 chiari obiettivi. 

Conoscere l’anatomia dello di stinco di Manzo.
Conoscere l'anatomia dello stinco di maiale.
Conoscere l'anatomia della spalla di maiale
Come sciogliere il tessuto connettivo in gelatina con le cotture lunghe.
Costruire un rub Texas Style.
Come si fa: Il Pepper Stout Beef, il Pulled Pork, lo stinco alla bavarese (Schweinshaxe) 

​

Level 3: dedicato a due icone del barbecue texano: Brisket & Beef Ribs

Il terzo livello svela tutte le criticità legate alle due preparazioni più complesse del vero barbecue americano: le short ribs e il brisket, rispettivamente le costolette e la punta di petto del manzo.
Le vere icone del Barbecue nello stile del Texas. 
Sono mattoni di fibre bovine incredibilmente tenaci e difficili da cuocere. A differenza delle tecniche usate nel secondo livello, la finestra di cottura ideale è minima, perché lo sfaldamento del connettivo deve avvenire in modo millimetrico e controllato. Sufficiente a rendere il taglio tenero,ma non così sfaldato da impedire il mantenimento della struttura delle fette. L'ultima sfida prima di diventare un Grill Master completo.
Obiettivi del corso 3 SMOKE TO PERFECTION - LEVEL THREEIn questo ultimo livello della Masterclass, se sei un neofita del mondo del barbecue low and slow, ti faremo raggiungere 7 chiari obiettivi.

Come sciogliere il tessuto connettivo in gelatina con le cotture lunghe.
Costruire un rub Texas Style.
Come individuare la ""small window"" di cottura ideale.
Introduzione al fenomeno dello stallo e soluzioni.
Come si fa: Texas Beef Ribs e Brisket.


 
Steak House Secrets - Il modulo per i Professionisti che vogliono aumentare il fatturato.
Visto il raggiungimento del goal, abbiamo aggiunto al progetto un altro modulo didattico composto da tre corsi. Sono corsi più specifici e di livello avanzato in cui daremo per scontate molte nozioni apprese nei moduli precedenti.Il modulo si chiama «Steak House Secrets» ed i tre corsi che lo compongono riguardano la bistecca, l’hamburger e il pastrami perfetto.

Nel corso sulla bistecca perfetta,prenderemo in esame tantissimi tagli, molti dei quali ancora sconosciuti in Italia ma che riscuotono un successo incredibile nelle steakhouse della grande mela: Hanger Steak, Flat Iron Steak, Denver Steak, Zabuton, Vegas Strip, Teres Mayor, Skirt Steak, Flap Steak, Flank Steak e molti altri. Sarà un viaggio nella comprensione dei tagli anatomici, delle varie espressioni di sapore, delle tecniche per massimizzare il gusto, passando per tutte quelle malizie che consentono di allargare l’orizzonte dei mattoncini di bovino cotti sulla griglia.
Se sei ancora convinto che la bistecca sia solo la costata con l’osso, questo corso ti darà una visione globale ed esaustiva di tutto l’insieme. L’approccio sarà, al solito, scientifico, riproducibile e scalabile a seconda delle diverse esigenze individuali.

Nel corso sull’hamburger perfetto,prenderemo in esame il “protocollo” di costruzione di un hamburger perfettamente bilanciato. Questa preparazione smette di essere una polpetta tra due pezzi di pane e diventa un’alchimia di elementi e sapori stratificati e perfettamente equalizzata sulla scala dell’eccellenza gustativa.
Non sarà solo una serie di ricette alternative, ma un metodo che consente di individuare e fissare le regole di costruzione di infinite ricette. Dalla sintassi dei singoli elementi che lo compongono quali topping, insalate e salse, fino alla semantica delle varie consistenze reologiche degli ingredienti che si sposano nel morso. Per essere molto chiari: non solo una dettagliata lista di cose da fare, ma una rivoluzione in cui rimetterà in discussione ogni certezza.
Pensa che abbiamo già iniziato ad interrogarci sull’altezza perfetta di un hamburger da mordere senza andare in iper-estensione mandibolare (azione che sposta la zona di comfort verso l’imbarazzo quando mangiamo davanti ad altri) pur mantenendo coerenza di espressione gustativa dal primo all’ultimo morso. Un hamburger, appunto, perfetto.

Nel corso sul Pastrami perfetto,Prenderemo in esame la preparazione più ambiziosa mai pensata per la carne bovina. Il Pastrami è un salume cotto, a base di punta di petto di manzo, che viene prima conciato, poi fermentato, affumicato, stufato e tagliato a fette, che vengono infine impilate in modo generoso in un morbido sandwich.
Il pastrami fa impazzire tutti ed è molto costoso proprio perché estremamente difficile da produrre. In italia non ha ancora trovato larga diffusione proprio per le difficoltà connesse alla sua realizzazione. In questo corso ci impegneremo a spiegarti tutte le criticità della preparazione puntando al risultato perfetto.
Come anticipato, questi tre corsi sono rivolti ad un’utenza più smaliziata e consapevole. Di certo, molti professionisti potranno beneficiare di questi corsi per aggiornare la proposta sul menù e finalmente riempire una domanda sempre crescente, che non trova un’offerta altrettanto valida. Gli amatori potranno invece passare al livello successivo, dove l’espressione del mondo della cottura sul fuoco assume tutti i contorni di una cucina gourmet e ricercata.

Perché il crowdfunding
Perché fare impresa oggi è molto difficile. Il successo di un progetto ambizioso come questo dipende da due fattori: la qualità dei contenuti offerti e la fiducia che gli utenti potranno dare alla formazione attraverso il video.
La BBQ4All University e Gianfranco Lo Cascio hanno deciso di mettere la faccia in questo progetto, perché la forza dei contenuti è acclamata a gran voce dalle migliaia di corsisti soddisfatti che hanno già partecipato ai singoli corsi nelle varie regioni d'Italia.
Siamo convinti che l'online sia l'unico mezzo capace di abbattere le distanze e di rendere fruibili contenuti didattici impeccabili, se e quando uniti alla grande professionalità dei tecnici di ripresa.
L'idea della Masterclass in video nasce dal grande desiderio, da parte di centinaia di persone, di partecipare ad una delle nostre lezioni, in quelle regioni che attualmente non riusciamo a coprire con i corsi dal vivo. Se anche tu sei fra coloro che lo hanno richiesto, questo è il momento perfetto per unirti alla community, accedere al percorso formativo della BBQ4All University e spendere il 50% in meno rispetto al prezzo dei corsi live, rimanendo in possesso delle lezioni per sempre. Lezioni che potrai rivedere in qualsiasi momento.
Per concludere, la realizzazione della Masterclass Grill & Smoke to Perfection sarà affidata a professionisti di lunga e comprovata esperienza; sia dal punto di vista dei contenuti che da quello delle tecniche di ripresa e post produzione. Le riprese saranno affidate ad un provider di servizi che produce abitualmente contenuti per la televisione (Sky e Rai) e verranno utilizzate 7 telecamere, 5 operatori di ripresa, più il regista, due autori (tra cui lo stesso Gianfranco Lo Cascio per la parte aurorale) 2 operatori per il montaggio, 4 Grill Master Executive, 2 assistenti di produzione e oltre un centinaio di oggetti di scena fra dispositivi e accessori.

Cosa rischi
Assolutamente nulla. Nel caso in cui il crowdfunding non dovesse raggiungere la soglia necessaria di fondi, ti verrà restituito l'intero importo e il progetto non sarà realizzato.
