My name is Julia Maryanska, and I've been making Documentaries for 11 yrs. I've worked alongside Academy-Award nominated and Emmy Award winning filmmakers, telling world stories about war, injustice, human rights abuses, violence and fear. While I felt these were important stories for the world to know, a few years ago, I woke up and realized that if I wanted to make a positive impact in this world, it would be by creating imagery of beauty and LOVE – not fear.

What's it about?

UNION is a feature length film that, through my insider's perspective, shows the intricate worlds of 6 truly unconventional love relationships. These men and women are living examples of the pioneers of new paradigms of relationships – from redefining ""til death do us part"" to raising kids in community to skillfully navigating open relationships. They make art out of the the ways they love while leading successful and impact-driven businesses, building communities, raising children, and more. This film is my personal exploration of my own experience in navigating the most taboo topics in love, sex and relationships and unearths the answers we're all hungry for.



With your support, THE FUNDS RAISED WILL TAKE US TO THE NEXT STEP of production and allow us to present more material to producers and investors to secure more traditional forms of film funding. We'll then start to move into post-production, and secure a very highly skilled editor who can get us started on cutting together the feature-length film! 



   What We Need & What You Get
Curious to know more? Here's what the $50,000 will go towards. It's only a portion of our larger budget, and will take us a long way!


PRODUCTION: $10,000 will go towards completing production in the Bay Area and NYC. This includes interviews like the ones you see above, and having a crew to capture using the fly on the wall, cinema verité approach, which means getting behind the scenes to bring you an intimate look into the real-time unfolding of these worlds


$20,000 will go towards hiring a top-notch storytelling editor. Documentaries get made in the Editing room! We need to begin cuting so we can see what other footage is necessary to complete our story. This will also enable us to have a more comprehensive story to present to producers and film investors who can help us to raise the rest of the film's budget.


$10,000 will go to our Producing team (these are veterans of film marketing, composition, sound design, copywriting, storytelling, and distribution) who will help move this film to the next stage of production, and get it before the eyes of new film investors, network and theatre programmers who will want to buy, fund and distribute the film!

<h2>I want to give you all some background information about the women behind this campaign.</h2>
<p>Founder/CEO, Monica Williams (my mom) served for over 5 years in the US Army Europe. Serving in the military allowed her to attain her BA in Arts and Entertainment Management from Colombia College Chicago and more recently her MBA from Keller Graduate School of Management. My mom's passions can be described easily: love and service. She loves service so much that she has decided to dedicate her life in to helping women that are in a position she was once in. Having been a homeless lady veteran with two children, she has real life experience in these situations and recognizes the need for support; and so Will2Win was born.</p>
<p>My name is Kai'Triana, though everyone calls me Kay. I am a Florida State University graduate, with a BA in Literature and a BA in Humanities, and a member of Hermandad de Sigma Iota Alpha, Inc. I am currently enrolled at Keller Graduate School of Management in the hopes of following in my mom's footsteps and attaining my MBA.</p>
<h2>So why do we want to help?</h2>
<p>As a single mother raising two girls, my sister and I, we had ups and downs. But with a lot help and support we made it. Everyone, but especially women only families, needs help sometimes.</p>
<p>It is sadly ironic that in some states, veterans make up upwards of 50% of the homeless population. How is this possible when these people served our country so that we could all have homes and all the freedoms we are afforded. Shouldn't we care for them when they come home?</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Give you numbers, you say?</h3>
<p>In most states, homeless veterans were typically found in shelters.
However, in five states,
the majority of homeless veterans were living in unsheltered locations: MT
(63%), CA (63%), NV (60%), HI (58%), and GA (55%).</p>
<p>In
Georgia 60.2% of homeless individuals are unsheltered 12,403 homeless 7,471
unsheltered</p>
<p>Homeless
veteran count by state 2014 GA - 1443</p>
<p>55.2%
of homeless veterans were unsheltered 1,443 homeless<span>  796 unsheltered  </span></p>
<p>Cite:
The U.S Department of Housing and Urban Development Office of Community
Planning and Development, 2014 AHAR: Part1 – PIT Estimate</p>
<p>The
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) estimates that 49,933
veterans are homeless on any given night.<span> 
The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) states that the nation’s
homeless veterans are predominantly male, with roughly 8% being female.  </span></p>
<p>Also in
2010 article an entitled “Risk Factors for Homeless Women Veterans,” in the <i>Journal of Health Care for the Poor and
Underserved</i>, provided research that proved that homeless lady veterans were
significantly less likely to be college educated, married, have health
insurance and much more. And these are events in life that are standard in
America. It also stated that ""women who served are 3 to 4 times more likely to become homeless, than non veterans.""</p>
<h2>So how
will Will2Win address these issues?</h2>
<p>Veteran
women have the ability to maintain, push forward, get it done; believe me, I
have seen it in action. But sometimes when one has multiple traumatic
experiences…births, graduations, marriages, addictions, death, abuse,
homelessness, setbacks, repossessions, evictions, joblessness, relocations etc,
a support team is critical to forward progress. Personally, I don’t know where we would be right now, after all that has happened if it were not for
friends and family that hung in there thru the highs and the lows.<span>  </span></p>
<p>Will2Win
is just that support, 360 degree support 24/7. We know that having more than
just the essentials (food, shelter, clothing) are necessary to turn your life
around. Some people need more support than others.<span>  </span></p>
<h2>The
Bone Structure of Will2Win:</h2>
<h4>Goal:<span>    To
empower veteran women with the support needed to become self-sufficient.<br/> </span>Mission:
<span>  To empower women veterans to
strive for excellence in all aspects of their lives; psychologically,
physically, emotionally, educationally, and financially.<br/></span>Vision:<span>    To
become the most successful service provider of women veterans.<br/></span>The
five components of the program address all of those needs:</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Will2Win
back my mental health will provide the connection with mental health
professionals who can aid in helping addressing triggers to nonproductive
behaviors that destroy or negate being a successful person.</p></li>
<li><p>Will2Win
back my physical health will re instill the ideal that exercise and a healthy
diet is consistent with good health practices.<span> 
This also includes instruction, information, and presentation of a
healthy diet.</span></p></li>
<li><p>Will2Win
back my educational health will encompass setting a goal to achieve a desired
educational goal whether that be a certification, Associates, Bachelors or
Masters degree. The main goal is to get the veteran to a point where she can
support herself thru gainful employment.</p></li>
<li><p>Will2Win
back my emotional health will utilize the in house community support system as
well as daily and weekly activities to stimulate desire to be responsibly
sociable.</p></li>
<li><p>Will2Win
back my financial health will instill the values of maintaining a bank/savings
account, responsible spending, credit repair, and home purchase.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Put
simply, our goal is to buy a house that our clients and their families can use
to get back on their feet and catch up to the world around them. The families
will live side by side with other families, similar to their own, helping to
create stable relationships and extend each families’ support system. While
living in the home, clients are helped to find jobs and childcare, taken to
health and/or counseling appointments; but most of all given the security of a
stable, healthy, clean environment with all their necessities. </p>
<p>All
services will be tailored to the individual receiving services based on an
assessment and intake questionnaire.<span>  </span></p>
<h2>So, why
did we choose to crowd fund?</h2>
<p>In
order for Will2Win to become eligible for government, corporate grants or other
large funding opportunities we need to show we are capable of successful
business operations for 1 to 2 years. As a startup organization you must be
able to prove your ability to raise and manage funds. Thus one of many
marketing and promotional endeavors for Will2Win is our first crowd funding
campaign. Plus, this is an easy way for our friends and family to donate funds
and share our mission through their social media. </p>
<h4>What is
needed to make Will2Win a viable option?</h4>
<p>•<span>  Cost of 501 c 3 now vs fiscal agent</span></p>
<p>•<span>  Equipment/Supplies (Computers, HMIS
(federal accountability), marketing)</span></p>
<p>•<span>  Location costs (Lot price, Furniture,
Zoning/Inspections, and much more)</span></p>
<p>•<span>  Gala to create awareness/raise funds
for late 2015/2016 operations </span></p>
<p>•<span>  Staffing needs </span></p>
<h4>What
have we already done to work toward our objective?</h4>
<p>(In
progress) business plan/research/revision to make information covered pertinent
to GA vs IL </p>
<p>-
obtained my FEIN number</p>
<p>-
obtained waiver for business license fees in GA (under disabled veteran status)</p>
<p>-
Networking with local organizations/event attendance to acclimate ourselves to
services currently being offered to homeless or at risk of being homeless women
veterans in Georgia.</p>
<p>-
obtained domain for website Will2WinAtlanta.com (going to also purchase .org)</p>
<p>-
obtained dedicated business phone line </p>
<p>-
completed home office set up </p>
<p>- plus
countless hours spent researching, cataloguing, networking, and much more in
the building Will2Win.</p>
<p>**For
example – Just the writing, recording, and editing for this campaign took
almost 20 hours!! Mind you, neither of us is extremely tech savvy, hence the
blooper reel hint earlier.**</p>
<p>The
funds raised here will go towards the ground work needed to establish a
location for Will2Win. We are not just seeking large donations. We actually
figured out that if thru each of you sharing with each of your friends and
everyone gave a dollar, we’d need 75,000 contacts to be informed on the
campaign. We are also seeking volunteers, sponsors, and donations to equip our
facility with all of the tools necessary to operate. Bonus if you have a
building, we could use that too.</p>
<p>As this
comes to a close, I hope you feel that you know a little bit more about
Will2Win and my family. I hope that you are so excited that you cannot wait to
join the movement!! I cannot mention enough that we need all the help that we
can get. </p>
<h4>Contact
me personally as Kai.Gully@Will2WinAtlanta.com, if none of the levels of
contribution fit your specific donation. </h4>
<h2>Thank
you for all the support that we have received thus far and please continue to
spread the word.<br/> **Keep
checking back with us for updates, we have a few fun things planned.**</h2>

just the essentials (food, shelter, clothing) are necessary to turn your life
around. Some people need more support than others.  
The
Bone Structure of Will2Win:
Goal:    To
empower veteran women with the support needed to become self-sufficient. Mission:
  To empower women veterans to
strive for excellence in all aspects of their lives; psychologically,
physically, emotionally, educationally, and financially.Vision:    To
become the most successful service provider of women veterans.The
five components of the program address all of those needs:

Will2Win
back my mental health will provide the connection with mental health
professionals who can aid in helping addressing triggers to nonproductive
behaviors that destroy or negate being a successful person.
Will2Win
back my physical health will re instill the ideal that exercise and a healthy
diet is consistent with good health practices. 
This also includes instruction, information, and presentation of a
healthy diet.
Will2Win
back my educational health will encompass setting a goal to achieve a desired
educational goal whether that be a certification, Associates, Bachelors or
Masters degree. The main goal is to get the veteran to a point where she can
support herself thru gainful employment.
Will2Win
back my emotional health will utilize the in house community support system as
well as daily and weekly activities to stimulate desire to be responsibly
sociable.
Will2Win
back my financial health will instill the values of maintaining a bank/savings
account, responsible spending, credit repair, and home purchase.

Put
simply, our goal is to buy a house that our clients and their families can use
to get back on their feet and catch up to the world around them. The families
will live side by side with other families, similar to their own, helping to
create stable relationships and extend each families’ support system. While
living in the home, clients are helped to find jobs and childcare, taken to
health and/or counseling appointments; but most of all given the security of a
stable, healthy, clean environment with all their necessities. 
All
services will be tailored to the individual receiving services based on an
assessment and intake questionnaire.  
So, why
did we choose to crowd fund?
In
order for Will2Win to become eligible for government, corporate grants or other
large funding opportunities we need to show we are capable of successful
business operations for 1 to 2 years. As a startup organization you must be
able to prove your ability to raise and manage funds. Thus one of many
marketing and promotional endeavors for Will2Win is our first crowd funding
campaign. Plus, this is an easy way for our friends and family to donate funds
and share our mission through their social media. 
What is
needed to make Will2Win a viable option?
•  Cost of 501 c 3 now vs fiscal agent
•  Equipment/Supplies (Computers, HMIS
(federal accountability), marketing)
•  Location costs (Lot price, Furniture,
Zoning/Inspections, and much more)
•  Gala to create awareness/raise funds
for late 2015/2016 operations 
•  Staffing needs 
What
have we already done to work toward our objective?
(In
progress) business plan/research/revision to make information covered pertinent
to GA vs IL 
-
obtained my FEIN number
-
obtained waiver for business license fees in GA (under disabled veteran status)
-
Networking with local organizations/event attendance to acclimate ourselves to
services currently being offered to homeless or at risk of being homeless women
veterans in Georgia.
-
obtained domain for website Will2WinAtlanta.com (going to also purchase .org)
-
obtained dedicated business phone line 
-
completed home office set up 
- plus
countless hours spent researching, cataloguing, networking, and much more in
the building Will2Win.
**For
example – Just the writing, recording, and editing for this campaign took
almost 20 hours!! Mind you, neither of us is extremely tech savvy, hence the
blooper reel hint earlier.**
The
funds raised here will go towards the ground work needed to establish a
location for Will2Win. We are not just seeking large donations. We actually
figured out that if thru each of you sharing with each of your friends and
everyone gave a dollar, we’d need 75,000 contacts to be informed on the
campaign. We are also seeking volunteers, sponsors, and donations to equip our
facility with all of the tools necessary to operate. Bonus if you have a
building, we could use that too.
As this
comes to a close, I hope you feel that you know a little bit more about
Will2Win and my family. I hope that you are so excited that you cannot wait to
join the movement!! I cannot mention enough that we need all the help that we
can get. 
Contact
me personally as Kai.Gully@Will2WinAtlanta.com, if none of the levels of
contribution fit your specific donation. 
Thank
you for all the support that we have received thus far and please continue to
spread the word. **Keep
checking back with us for updates, we have a few fun things planned.**

It's a project that we’re excited to share with the world, and we'd like to invite you to join our corporate family.Sneak PeeksWe've put together a few clips as a preview of the series. Bogdana's Seduction TipBogdana gives Agent J9 a last minute hint on seducing a target.Serpent SurvivalThe Komodo gives his assassins a little reminder of their role in the organization. Janine's ResumeAgent J9 gives the reasons why she's the best of the best of S.E.R.P.E.N.T. Career GoalsHR challenges Janine on her future at S.E.R.P.E.N.T. Our primary goal is to raise enough funds to complete the post process. Our secondary goal is to cover all of our production costs, including equipment rental, location fees and principle talent. And finally, we want to make sure that everyone — from our volunteer PAs to our extras to our lighting assistants to our script supervisor — gets compensated for their contributions to the project. Short films are largely made with favors, but we want to break that trend.World domination isn't easy, but we’ve assembled a killer team to make this project happen. An actor, director and producer, Carrie Jones is one of the creators of the interactive theater experience, My Big Fat Jewish Wedding, has starred as Ms. Blonde in an all female reimagining of Reservoir Dogs, a regular player in murder-mystery experiences, and now is our titular heroine (or villainess), Agent J9.  Agent J9, ‘Janine,’ is smart, tough, and not someone you’d like to meet in a dark alley. But one thing she is not is subtle. Or seductive. Or living if she can’t prove to HR that she’s worth keeping alive. In addition to playing J9's rival and seduction coach, Bogdana, the multi-talented Jamie Dixon is an actress, make-up artist, musician, and costume/set designer. She has a diverse background from business to improv and also co-stars on a new upcoming Youtube review show titled Viewport.Bogdana is as merciless as she is beautiful. A killer with a killer bod, she detests J9, but loves a challenge. Can she turn this sows ear into a silk purse? Probably not, but at least she can mock J9 along the way. Our executive producer and S.E.R.P.E.N.T.’s head of HR, Gladys, Leslie Engel has been integral in bringing our vision to life. Leslie is an actor and producer. She is the founder/CEO of BGE Creative and Kohala Dog Productions, which gets its namesake from Leslie's passion for Ironman Triathlons and her amazing Yellow Lab.Gladys is someone who’s been at S.E.R.P.E.N.T. a long time. Long enough to move out of the assassin game and into middle management and find herself an HR director in the company. Does she regret the decision to leave the field? Yep. Is this why she has nothing but contempt for anyone who can’t live up to her standards as an agent for the company? Also, yep. Which is why she hates Janine. S.E.R.P.E.N.T.'s CEO and perfect corporate shark, Josh Drennen's most recent performances have included a turn on ""The Last Ship"" which will air this summer on TNT, the films ""A Perfect Dark"", ""Hollywood Adventures"", ""The Last River"", and ""Customer Service"" along with stage roles as William Reach in Down the Road and various comedies in the Cafe Plays at the Ruskin Group Theatre at which he is a member and guest teacher.The Komodo is a man who knows what he wants. And what he wants is to rule the world. He has the tools to do it. He has the will, the means, and a genius-level intellect. He’s an executive apex-predator. The perfect capitalist sociopath. What he lacks in personal skills and patience he makes up for with ambition, confidence, material possessions, and megalomania. Filmmaker and actor with dreams of becoming a brilliant housewife, Ericson Just plays Otto, the unassuming assistant of S.E.R.P.E.N.T.'s CEO, Komodo. He also served as Assistant Director on the project while Directing his own feature film, 'The Burden of My Company', which is set to premiere later this year.  
Otto is a small island of normal in a world of crazy. To say he has no idea what’s going on is an exaggeration, but just barely. He’s starting to catch on that his new job just may not quite be what he thought it was, and he’s having trouble coping with the realization that he may now be evil for being part of S.E.R.P.E.N.T. His only mission is to keep his head down, for fear of getting it chopped off.



Our writer and director, Chad Jones has been an art director, a copywriter, a screenwriter, a comic book author, and a game designer. He’s worked on national ad campaigns, alternate reality games, theme park attractions, and now he’s using his skills to bring Assassin Nine to life.

James  Milner plays with cameras and lights to make pretty pictures. He’s our extremely talented director of photography, and generally an all around good guy.

Our line producer, David Kabbe started as a stunt man and stunt coordinator on feature films and live events before moving into stage managing and production coordinating in television. He now produces independent content, and production coordinates live events and premieres for studios and large film industry supported non-profits. Some of these clients are: the Motion Picture Television Fund, Dreamworks Animation, Sony Studios, Paramount, Relativity Media, SHOAH Foundation, Warner Bros. and Instyle Magazine.

<p>We are the first roller derby league in Greece. Every start is a difficult one, especially when your country's economy is in ruins and there is capital control enforced, meaning no money can exit or enter the country. Greece is in a economic and societal crisis, leaving 75% of our skaters unemployed. A lot of our skaters have quit because they cannot afford the 4.50 euros that it costs to hire a venue per practice. On top of that there are no derby shops in Greece.<br/>The purpose of this campaign is to enable us to equip our skaters and to eventually hire an indoor venue. We are currently practicing outdoors and in tiny bowling alleys and hiring equipment that is inappropriate and unsafe (the skates we hire are literally plastic, we add our own padding to the tiny knee pads we can get our hands on - DIY to the bone! ) These have resulted in serious injuries that render some of our skaters out of action for up to 2 years! We understand that roller derby is an extreme sport, but we cannot even take the basic safety measures due to our finances. The bowling alley that we use is tiny, not even big enough 50% of a track and slippery, as it gets waxed, and rarely available. The outdoor venue can only be used when the weather is good.<br/>By contributing to this campaign you will be helping us achieve our passion of playing roller derby in a country that offers nothing to its people and where it is a necessary outlet.</p>

<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul> </ul>
<div>Your contribution is not just financial help, but also solidarity to what our sport stands for: building community and empowering women. Greece needs roller derby more than ever. Statistically women suffer the most in the current economy and the media representations are perpetuating inequality, especially in sport, which is monopolised by men. Roller derby has always been an outlet for female creativity, strength, confidence and sisterhood and Greek women need this desperately. By helping us, you are opening up a new chapter in the dialogue of Greek sport, where men, women, immigrants, queers and LGBTQI people are finally in the same conversation.</div>
<div>We have been part of the creation of the national team, which also required fundraising, sponsors and support and within a year managed to get all three and make its way to Dallas for the roller derby world cup.</div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul> </ul>
<div>One of the challenges we may face is that we might not be able to afford printing merchandise and start making money out of it right away. Our league consists of a lot of talented individuals that are willing to maximise our profit. In the distant future we aim to open an online store to reach more buyers for our merch.</div>
<div>We might not manage to reach our goal and afford equipment and venue, but we are happy to have raised awareness about Greek roller derby, which strengthens the solidarity within our the international derby community.</div>

Our league consists of a lot of talented individuals that are willing to maximise our profit. In the distant future we aim to open an online store to reach more buyers for our merch.
We might not manage to reach our goal and afford equipment and venue, but we are happy to have raised awareness about Greek roller derby, which strengthens the solidarity within our the international derby community.

<p><b>Synopsis</b><br/>Come and See is a short post-apocalyptic film about a young woman named Blake. The narrative focuses on a snippet of her life as she wanders through an abandoned town, like so many before. She encounters traces of the people that used to live here and the lives they have led and left behind. Initially amused by her discoveries, these feelings quickly dissipate as loneliness consumes her and she finds herself aching for any kind of human interaction. The unfolding story and elements in the scenery let us know that Blake has been alone for quite some time and can't cope with the isolation anymore.  She is reaching her breaking point.  In a last struggle to carry on she ends up finding a most unlikely companion and together they continue the journey.<br/></p>

</div><p><b>Connection</b><br/>Many
of the struggles that the protagonist undergoes are things that resonate with
all of us. This film explores the themes of hope and solitude,
something which everyone experiences now and then. While we all need time to be with ourselves,
this film explores when that becomes too much, when we start craving for
something more, because as people we intrinsically need someone to share our
stories with.  It makes you wonder what
it would feel like to be truly and completely alone.  Can we really be happy in such a state of
mind?  Where do we go looking for
comfort?  Is hope all we need to keep us
going?  Is there a purpose to life
without anyone or anything to share it with?<br/></p><p><b>Influences</b><br/>There
is no spoon feeding, only hinting.  As
such the film roughly takes on the context of the biblical apocalypse story in
the Book of Revelations, but this is never explicitly stated and not essential
for being able to connect with the themes. 
While people that do have knowledge of these scriptures will be able to
identify the symbols peppered throughout the journey and understand their
significance.<br/></p><p>Inspired by the visual storytelling of Andrei Tarchovsky’s “Stalker”, the elegance of Chan-wook Park’s “Stoker” and Nic Pizzolatto’s “True Detective” the film seeks to immerse the audience into the atmosphere of the lonely post-apocalyptic world.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449006869/xfglbz5m8dpqtnu68gpl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>We are a crew of 12 passionate individuals, who want to make a wonderfully thoughtful film with an actress and a horse in Spain.  Here's a couple of our key team members. <div><br/></div><div>

<p>Banjo Romantika tells the unique story of how an American music has become rooted in Czech culture.  We provide intimate stories that explain how bluegrass - a regionally-based acoustic form of US country music - has afforded Czechs ways of dealing with communist totalitarianism, the transition to capitalism, and the onset of globalism.  </p>
<p>News about Banjo Romantika is currently spreading , as it is broadcasting on PBS stations across the US during the winter of 2015-16 (see <a href=""http://www.banjoromantika.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">schedule at our website</a>).   While we are working on DVD distribution to get the film itself on the market, we will create a soundtrack CD album that will feature music from the film, tracks by participating musicians, and exclusive unreleased material from the filmmaking process. </p>
<p>The film has moved many audiences, opening new spaces for discussion, art, and movement.  Releasing this soundtrack album will provide new opportunities to spark conversations about where bluegrass music can belongs and how we can share a global discourse across cultural boundaries. <br/></p>

</div></div>","What we are doing We are Shara Lange and Lee Bidgood, an independent documentary filmmaker and an ethnomusicologist.  We teamed up to produce ""Banjo Romantika"" (2015, 55 min), a film that documents the ways that Czech people have cultivated bluegrass music since first hearing it in the 1950s.   
Banjo Romantika tells the unique story of how an American music has become rooted in Czech culture.  We provide intimate stories that explain how bluegrass - a regionally-based acoustic form of US country music - has afforded Czechs ways of dealing with communist totalitarianism, the transition to capitalism, and the onset of globalism.  
News about Banjo Romantika is currently spreading , as it is broadcasting on PBS stations across the US during the winter of 2015-16 (see schedule at our website).   While we are working on DVD distribution to get the film itself on the market, we will create a soundtrack CD album that will feature music from the film, tracks by participating musicians, and exclusive unreleased material from the filmmaking process. 
The film has moved many audiences, opening new spaces for discussion, art, and movement.  Releasing this soundtrack album will provide new opportunities to spark conversations about where bluegrass music can belongs and how we can share a global discourse across cultural boundaries. 



  What can you do? We are both junior faculty members at East Tennessee State University (Shara heads the Radio, TV, and Film program and Lee teaches in Bluegrass, Old Time, and Country Music Studies), and have undertaken this film project without prior funding.  We funded the filming ourselves and obtained grants from ETSU to cover post-production costs.  
We are asking for funding for the soundtrack album since we have no more personal funds to spend on this project.  
We are so thankful to our colleagues at ETSU and in the Czech Republic who have helped make this film happen, giving time, expertise, meals, couches to sleep on, etc.  Still, we estimate that it will cost around $6000 to produce a professional quality soundtrack album, including:



 cover and liner notes (art, layout, etc.)


 permissions, publishing/licensing and other legal fees


 the cost of mixing and mastering the album

 the cost of duplication

Any funds above the cost of producing the album will go towards defraying other costs related to the film project (non-sexy things like insurance, etc.)







The Impact This album will release material that we couldn't fit into the short time-frame of Banjo Romantika, including full-length performances of songs from the film, some newly recorded material, field recordings from Lee's research work, etc.  If you liked what you heard in the film, you can hear the whole song and more of the background of Czech bluegrass!

The Need 




With

educational programs is growing by the day. From in-camp and mobile 
classrooms for refugees to job training and cultural assimilation, 
education must be brought to the refugee population to ensure their 
economic and social survival. If this were your family, what would you do?













The Solution





World Peace One, led by co-founder Claes Nobel, has joined with UCLA Extension, United Earth, and the International Association for Human Values
 to bring our deep educational resources into the field. To raise the 
funds required, we are creating a viral campaign that will capture 
immediate global attention. At its core is one incredible song: 
Forgotten People by Ugandan group the Ganda Boys. Listen to the song now.
The funds raised through the film will be provided to World Peace One Education for community-based education to refugees in transit, and in the Jordanian refugee camps. Key aspects include:

Gateways to learning: creating sustainable access to innovative learning and online training.
Empowering women and girls: lifting up the dreams of woman who want to start a business.
A new generation of health workers: training tomorrow's health care workers.
Rebuilding dignity: creating jobs in training.

Peace projects: Building refugee-led projects.

<p>Lorenzo Macias III, is an Ohio native, known as Youngg-Leo, from the Stoopid Rich Kids collective. Moving his melodies in more dark, moody and atmospheric tone, unlike his peers, Leo mainly focuses on R&amp;B and has perfected the Trapsoul sound that has become so popular. His two released projects, Through My Eyes and LEO &amp; AJ have gotten his music career off to a great start. He has also released a handful of successful singles, such as his feature on NATEtheKiDD’s I’m Weak Without You, as well as his own “The Realest, Trust Nobody, All Mine and more. He is currently finishing up his next project to be titled Where to Next, set to drop early this year.</p>

<p>Although being relatively unknown within Stoopid Rich Kids, Nathan Bartelle, professionally known as NATEtheKiDD, quickly made a name for himself in 2019. Fresh off of his hit single “I’m Weak Without You” featuring Youngg-Leo, Nathan looks to continue the hype throughout 2020. He has a very versatile sound ranging from lyrical verses to catchy hooks. In 2019 NATEtheKiDD released his mixtape “#DONTMISSTHEWAVE”. Along with “I’m Weak Without You”, the tape consists of songs such as “Dark vs. Light”, “Time Flows”, and “Kobe”. Near the end of 2019 Nathan released 2 tracks titled “Jet” featuring AcEtheGenius and “Back Of The Whip Freestyle”. Nathan looks to continue dominating 2020 with new sounds.</p>

<p>Hailing from New York, Adam Spencer recently began producing beats under the alias AdamtheProducer. Being friends with the Stoopid Rich Kids, he took an interest in making his own music. In the following time, he quickly started producing his own beats. In only a short time span, his progression became more and more evident to his peers. Recently, Adam has begun pushing out his content through platforms YouTube and Beatstars respectively, looking to gain a following and make a name for himself in a sea of aspiring producers.</p>

<p>Blaise Scioli II is the 17 year old manager and close friend of the Stoopid Rich Kids collective. When he isn’t in class or at his job at Panera Bread, he acts as the brains of the SRK operation. His focus is on marketing and promotion for the members and himself, being a driving force in many projects of the SRK collective. One thing immediately evident about Blaise is his out-of-the-box thinking, and dedicated attitude. He enjoys writing TV shows and anime, as well as stories and movies. He hopes to one day produce them and more large scale projects.</p>

<p>A sophomore at the prestigious art school Savannah College Of Art And Design, better known as SCAD, Carl Crisman is making a name for himself as a talented young animation artist. Specializing in many forms of the medium, from animated television to music video animation, his diversity and raw talent allows him to push the boundaries of what a young professional is capable of. With an eye for great design and the awareness of what the people want, Carl is an artist with mainstream appeal that doesn’t sacrifice his art style.</p>

<p>Shant Kazandjian has had a knack for the arts since a young age. Growing up in Mount Laurel, alongside current collaborator and close friend Zach Gold, Shant started his journey participating in stage crew in middle school. As his opportunities expanded, so did his range of talents. Throughout high school, he took an interest in photography and cinematography and joined the Film and TV club. Once the school day ended, he satisfied his hunger for the arts by creating a small business focused on video work and photography work. He then made the decision to join SCAD, one of the top art schools in the world. In his junior year, he narrowed his focus on producing and, using the experience he has in all other aspects of the industry, has made a big splash in his role. He has high expectations for himself, his teammates, and the projects he works on; and the quality of his work shines because of it.</p>

<p>Zach Gold and his journey in film started from a young age. His mother bought him his first camera, the original gopro, at age 8. He began editing videos of him skiing and surfing on his iPad, and his journey took off from there. When he hit middle school he joined stage crew, meeting close friend and future collaborator Shant Kazandjian. When he hit high school, his raw talent began to shine. His film teacher noticed his strengths, and brought him to the film club, where he quickly established himself in a key role alongside many older peers. He linked back up with Shant and many other friends, starting his own business and making many notable projects primarily as the editor and visionary of them. His junior year he took on leadership roles in the club, bringing home many film festival awards. The same success continued his senior year. During this time, he became close with the SRK collective, and began collaborating with them. He then left for SCAD, Savannahs premiere film and art school, where he has specialized as an editor and visionary director. He has not forgotten his friends and old collaborators however, linking back up with Shant and the SRK collective for many more projects, and many more to come.</p>

His debut mixtape Boy Meets World released on his 18th birthday and contains songs like Rainbow Road, My Phone, and Heart & Emotions. His second, collaborative project with Youngg-Leo “Leo & AJ” released only months later on January 1st, 2019. The EP A Little Bit of Sunshine dropped in the month of June with the singles STAR, and Sky & Sun being the two breakout songs from the project.

Lorenzo Macias III, is an Ohio native, known as Youngg-Leo, from the Stoopid Rich Kids collective. Moving his melodies in more dark, moody and atmospheric tone, unlike his peers, Leo mainly focuses on R&B and has perfected the Trapsoul sound that has become so popular. His two released projects, Through My Eyes and LEO & AJ have gotten his music career off to a great start. He has also released a handful of successful singles, such as his feature on NATEtheKiDD’s I’m Weak Without You, as well as his own “The Realest, Trust Nobody, All Mine and more. He is currently finishing up his next project to be titled Where to Next, set to drop early this year.

Although being relatively unknown within Stoopid Rich Kids, Nathan Bartelle, professionally known as NATEtheKiDD, quickly made a name for himself in 2019. Fresh off of his hit single “I’m Weak Without You” featuring Youngg-Leo, Nathan looks to continue the hype throughout 2020. He has a very versatile sound ranging from lyrical verses to catchy hooks. In 2019 NATEtheKiDD released his mixtape “#DONTMISSTHEWAVE”. Along with “I’m Weak Without You”, the tape consists of songs such as “Dark vs. Light”, “Time Flows”, and “Kobe”. Near the end of 2019 Nathan released 2 tracks titled “Jet” featuring AcEtheGenius and “Back Of The Whip Freestyle”. Nathan looks to continue dominating 2020 with new sounds.

Hailing from New York, Adam Spencer recently began producing beats under the alias AdamtheProducer. Being friends with the Stoopid Rich Kids, he took an interest in making his own music. In the following time, he quickly started producing his own beats. In only a short time span, his progression became more and more evident to his peers. Recently, Adam has begun pushing out his content through platforms YouTube and Beatstars respectively, looking to gain a following and make a name for himself in a sea of aspiring producers.

Blaise Scioli II is the 17 year old manager and close friend of the Stoopid Rich Kids collective. When he isn’t in class or at his job at Panera Bread, he acts as the brains of the SRK operation. His focus is on marketing and promotion for the members and himself, being a driving force in many projects of the SRK collective. One thing immediately evident about Blaise is his out-of-the-box thinking, and dedicated attitude. He enjoys writing TV shows and anime, as well as stories and movies. He hopes to one day produce them and more large scale projects.

A sophomore at the prestigious art school Savannah College Of Art And Design, better known as SCAD, Carl Crisman is making a name for himself as a talented young animation artist. Specializing in many forms of the medium, from animated television to music video animation, his diversity and raw talent allows him to push the boundaries of what a young professional is capable of. With an eye for great design and the awareness of what the people want, Carl is an artist with mainstream appeal that doesn’t sacrifice his art style.

Shant Kazandjian has had a knack for the arts since a young age. Growing up in Mount Laurel, alongside current collaborator and close friend Zach Gold, Shant started his journey participating in stage crew in middle school. As his opportunities expanded, so did his range of talents. Throughout high school, he took an interest in photography and cinematography and joined the Film and TV club. Once the school day ended, he satisfied his hunger for the arts by creating a small business focused on video work and photography work. He then made the decision to join SCAD, one of the top art schools in the world. In his junior year, he narrowed his focus on producing and, using the experience he has in all other aspects of the industry, has made a big splash in his role. He has high expectations for himself, his teammates, and the projects he works on; and the quality of his work shines because of it.

Zach Gold and his journey in film started from a young age. His mother bought him his first camera, the original gopro, at age 8. He began editing videos of him skiing and surfing on his iPad, and his journey took off from there. When he hit middle school he joined stage crew, meeting close friend and future collaborator Shant Kazandjian. When he hit high school, his raw talent began to shine. His film teacher noticed his strengths, and brought him to the film club, where he quickly established himself in a key role alongside many older peers. He linked back up with Shant and many other friends, starting his own business and making many notable projects primarily as the editor and visionary of them. His junior year he took on leadership roles in the club, bringing home many film festival awards. The same success continued his senior year. During this time, he became close with the SRK collective, and began collaborating with them. He then left for SCAD, Savannahs premiere film and art school, where he has specialized as an editor and visionary director. He has not forgotten his friends and old collaborators however, linking back up with Shant and the SRK collective for many more projects, and many more to come.",8.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>My name is Irving Towne. I am a theatrical producer from Amsterdam, New York. I have six years producing experience in radio drama and two in theatre drama. My dream is to live a life of full expression and dramatics and to share my dream with you.</p>
<p>My campaign is to fund “Verily,” an original screenplay, into a completed film. Verily is a personal story of loss and redemption and it took me almost a year to complete the screenplay, so my drive is to see it done.</p>
<p>Verily will be my first film. I am finding that moviemaking can be a complex endeavor with a complication around every turn, which inspires me to plan better and execute better. If you were to help me accomplish the completion of my dream, with your gift and your support, it would be monumental in terms of inspiring me to accomplish the thrilling moviemaking I plan to do in the future.</p>
<p>Budget</p>
<p> In terms of our planning, our budget for completion of the project is $200,000, which would be $60,000 above-the-line, (Producers, director, DP, editors) + $140,000 for below-the-line (for positions like camera assistants, foley artists, gaffers, grips, catering, drivers, security).  If we don’t reach our goal, all the collected funds will go toward production costs, regardless of the amount.</p>

<p>There are a couple of subjects in Verily that stand out, that I believe are worthy of your interest. The first is child abuse and its long-lasting effect on the victim. Jason, the main character, was so severely traumatized by his abuse that he was still reacting into his 40’s, which led, partially, to his faith crisis in not forming efficient personal guidelines to belief and trust. The other most significant subject is in the film is the nature and role of God in the universe. So many people I know have had a tragedy in their lives and question whether he actually exists and wonder why he could let bad things happen to good people, and Verily examines that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I will say that this project is not going to be easy. This is a significantly more difficult project than I’ve faced to date with many moving parts which will require complex planning strategies.I plan on approaching the situations arising during production with logic, reason, (and a little bit of panic!) and by surrounding myself with industry professionals to support me. In addition, I am committed to diversity in staffing both cast and crew.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With the challenges these times present, I considered launching at this time to be a risk, however, is anything worth doing, without risk? That being said, I feel this is a risk worth taking, and I hope you do too. In fact, the message in my film is so important and applicable to our society that I think you will agree so I would appreciate your support. I would also appreciate your support by raising awareness. I hope you will like, follow, and share my page and website on social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

They isolate and hide themselves in their rooms for months, sometimes even years, mainly due to society's pressure. With the lack of support from the people around them, including their own families, many of them spiral into giving up in life. Feeling lost and pressured to abandon their passions, these youths isolate themselves from the society that has betrayed their trust. </p><p>K2 House is a rehabilitation facility where Hikikomoris live together in pursuit of reentering society, rediscover their passions, re-building their self-esteem and most importantly, regain faith and trust in society. </p><p>We follow three of the members and discover what caused them to isolate themselves - from issues of body shaming to the lack of support to pursue their dreams. </p><p>As we follow their road to recovery, we hear their stories and see how and if they will overcome their traumatic past to re-enter society.</p><h2> </h2><h2>WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP:</h2><p>All your contribution will go into helping us <strong>create a film</strong> that not only <strong>gives them the voice</strong> they deserve but also does them justice. </p><p>It took a lot of bravery and trust from them to open up and <strong>share their extraordinary stories</strong> with us. We hope that we can convey their messages properly and to unveil the <strong>hidden beauty in these youths. </strong></p><p>With your help, we promise to dedicate our time to creating something beautiful for these misunderstood youths. </p><p>As of now, all expenses have been from the directors’ pockets. We need some help to fully create a <strong>film that our subject deserves</strong>. We are asking for <strong>$15,000</strong> to achieve this. </p><p>All the <strong>funds raised will go directly into the documentary</strong> and the budget calculated <strong>does not include payment towards any of the crew.</strong></p><p>It will go into, quality music composition/licensing, professional color grading, final film editing, animations, sound design &amp; mixing and all other <strong>post-production costs.</strong> </p><p>All extra donations will go into helping us apply to film festivals, marketing and will give <strong>25% directly to the K2 House in Korea</strong>, to help them upgrade their facilities. </p><h2> </h2><h2>WHY IS THIS ISSUE IMPORTANT:</h2><p><strong>Hikikomoris are those with Acute Society Withdrawal</strong> and isolate themselves, away from people, for <strong>months to years</strong>. </p><p>This is a very <strong>underreported and misunderstood issue</strong> that is a <strong>world-wide phenomenon</strong>. <strong>Everyone and anyone can be affected by it</strong>, especially with the multiple present day pressures. </p><p>A lot of people who hear about Hikikomoris prejudicially assume they are those who choose to isolate themselves in their room to play video games and to avoid responsibilities, however, this is <strong>a huge misconception</strong>. These youths are usually <strong>affected by the numerous rules and pressures of society</strong>. They feel completely betrayed when those closest to them doesn't trust their potential to pursue the goals. When even their closest friends or even their parents <strong>disregards and belittle their passion, they shut down. </strong></p><p>This documentary does not only shed light and <strong>give these people a voice, but it also resonates with millions more who may be looking to pursue a dream</strong>, even though he/she may feel there is <strong>no support or faith</strong> from those around them. </p><p>In a time of the Coronavirus, where everyone is forced to be isolated and keep their social lives on a halt - viewers may get a sense of how difficult it was for Hikikomoris to be isolate themselves for months and years. </p><p><strong>Let’s work together</strong> to not only give them a voice, but to <strong>fix the problem we all have in society</strong>. Not conforming to society should not go punished, it should be celebrated and understood.</p><p> </p><h2><strong>FINAL WORDS:</strong></h2><p>Our sole purpose here is to try and make a difference for these youths and to let them know they are being heard. </p><p>On that note, even without any financial contributions, we hope that you will watch this (legally or illegally) and  learn from this documentary and share the importance of community and the support for one another, no matter how different their lifestyles might be. </p><p> </p><p>You can further support us by following our website/facebook/instagram.</p><p><a href=""http://www.breakingisolationfilm.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.breakingisolationfilm.com</a></p><p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/BreakingIsolationFilm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/BreakingIsolationFilm</a></p><p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/breaking_isolation_film/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.instagram.com/breaking_isolation_film</a></p><p> </p><p>Thank you so much for all the support! </p><p> </p><p>-------------------</p><p> </p><h2>시놉시스:</h2><p>‘은둔형 외톨이’라고 알려져있는 히키코모리는 주로 사회의 압박으로 인해 몇 달, 혹은 몇 년동안 방에서 고립 상태로 지냅니다. 주변에 의존할 곳이 없는 상태에 이르며 삶의 많은 것을 포기한 채로 지내죠. 하고 싶은 일을 포기해야한다는 압박감과 상실감을 느낀 많은 젊은이들이 사회로부터 등을 돌리고 있습니다. </p><p>K2하우스는 히키코모리들이 공동체 생활을 하는 곳입니다. K2 멤버들은 함께 지내며 자신감을 회복하고 꿈을 다시 찾아 사회로 나갈 준비를 하죠. </p><p>저희는 세 명의 K2멤버의 삶을 들여다보고 무엇이 그들을 고립 상태에 이르게 만들었는지 들어봤습니다. 본인 몸에 대한 수치심부터 하고 싶은 일을 인정해주지 않았던 주변 사람들 이야기까지요. 그들의 회복 과정을 따라다니며 그들이 과거의 상처를 극복하는지, 그리고 어떻게 다시 사회로 돌아오려고 하는지를 조명합니다.</p><p> </p><h2>도움이 필요합니다:</h2><p>여러분의 도움은 히키코모리들의 목소리를 세상에 전하는 이 다큐멘터리에 사용됩니다. </p><p>영상의 주인공들은 큰 용기를 내어 저희에게 본인들의 엄청난 이야기를 들려줬습니다. 이들의 메시지가 제대로 전달되고 이 청년들 내면의 멋진 모습들을 세상에 공개할 수 있기를 바랍니다.</p><p>여러분의 도움으로 이 청년들을 위한 아름다운 영상을 만들 것을 약속드립니다.</p><p>지금까지 영상을 만드는 과정에서의 모든 비용은 저희 사비로 해결했지만, 이 다큐멘터리를 완성시키기 위해서는 15,000달러 (약 1600만원)라는 비용이 들며 여러분의 도움이 필요합니다.</p><p>모든 자금은 다큐멘터리 제작과 출품을 위해서만 사용됩니다. 음악 작곡과 저작권, 컬러 보정, 최종 편집, 애니메이션, 일러스트, 사운드 디자인과 믹싱을 포함한 모든 포스트 프로덕션 (post-production) 비용으로 사용됩니다.</p><p>추가 모금은 영화제에 출품하고 홍보 활동에 사용되며 추가 모금의 25%는 K2하우스의 시설을 업그레이드 할 수 있도록 기부금으로 전달됩니다.</p><p> </p><h2>중요한 이유:</h2><p>히키코모리와 같은 청년 문제는 세계적으로 일어나고 있으며, 잘 알려지지 않았거나 잘 못 알려진 경우가 있습니다. 특히 사회적 압박으로 인해 누구나 고립될 수 있는 문제입니다.</p><p>많은 사람들은 히키코모리가 게임을 하고 책임감을 회피하고 싶어서 은둔 생활을 선택해서 한다고 생각합니다. 하지만 사실 그렇지 않죠. 주로 이 청년들은 사회의 규칙과 압력의 영향을 받았으며, 가장 가깝다고 느끼는 주변 사람들이 본인들의 꿈에 대한 신뢰와 지지를 해주지 않았을 때 상처를 받았습니다. 특히 가족과 친구들이 그들의 열정을 무시했을 때 이 청년들은 무너지고는 했죠. </p><p>이 다큐멘터리는 히키코모리의 목소리를 전할 뿐만 아니라, 열정을 갖고 꿈을 쫓지만 지쳐가는 모든 사람들에게 메시지를 주고자 합니다. 또한 코로나로 인해 많은 활동들이 제한되며 저희는 몇 달, 혹은 몇 년동안 고립되어 있는게 얼마나 힘든 일인지 조금은 공감될거라 생각합니다.</p><p>이 청년들에게 목소리를 낼 수 있는 기회 뿐만 아니라 우리 사회의 문제를 돌아보고 고쳐나갈 수 있으면 좋겠습니다. 사회에 어울리지 않는다는 건 벌 받아야 하는게 아니라, 그 다름을 인정받고 이해되어야 하기 때문이죠. </p><p> </p><h2>끝으로:</h2><p>저희가 여기까지 온 유일한 이유는 이 청년들에게 영향을 주고 누군가는 그들의 이야기를 들어주고 있다는걸 알려주고 싶어서 입니다. 기부 여부를 떠나서 이 다큐멘터리를 통해 서로에 대한 지지와 공동체의 중요성, 그리고 우리 사회를 돌아보는 기회가 되었으면 좋겠습니다.</p><p>저희 웹사이트 / 페이스북 / 인스타그램을 통해 더 알아볼 수 있습니다.</p><p><a href=""http://www.breakingisolationfilm.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.breakingisolationfilm.com</a></p><p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/BreakingIsolationFilm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/BreakingIsolationFilm</a></p><p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/breaking_isolation_film"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.instagram.com/breaking_isolation_film</a></p><p>감사합니다.</p></div>","OUR SYNOPSIS: Hikikomori is the Japanese word for people with Acute Society Withdrawal.

We are asking for $15,000 to achieve this. All the funds raised will go directly into the documentary and the budget calculated does not include payment towards any of the crew.It will go into, quality music composition/licensing, professional color grading, final film editing, animations, sound design & mixing and all other post-production costs. All extra donations will go into helping us apply to film festivals, marketing and will give 25% directly to the K2 House in Korea, to help them upgrade their facilities.  WHY IS THIS ISSUE IMPORTANT:Hikikomoris are those with Acute Society Withdrawal and isolate themselves, away from people, for months to years. This is a very underreported and misunderstood issue that is a world-wide phenomenon. Everyone and anyone can be affected by it, especially with the multiple present day pressures. A lot of people who hear about Hikikomoris prejudicially assume they are those who choose to isolate themselves in their room to play video games and to avoid responsibilities, however, this is a huge misconception. These youths are usually affected by the numerous rules and pressures of society. They feel completely betrayed when those closest to them doesn't trust their potential to pursue the goals. When even their closest friends or even their parents disregards and belittle their passion, they shut down. This documentary does not only shed light and give these people a voice, but it also resonates with millions more who may be looking to pursue a dream, even though he/she may feel there is no support or faith from those around them. In a time of the Coronavirus, where everyone is forced to be isolated and keep their social lives on a halt - viewers may get a sense of how difficult it was for Hikikomoris to be isolate themselves for months and years. Let’s work together to not only give them a voice, but to fix the problem we all have in society. Not conforming to society should not go punished, it should be celebrated and understood. FINAL WORDS:Our sole purpose here is to try and make a difference for these youths and to let them know they are being heard. On that note, even without any financial contributions, we hope that you will watch this (legally or illegally) and  learn from this documentary and share the importance of community and the support for one another, no matter how different their lifestyles might be.  You can further support us by following our website/facebook/instagram.www.breakingisolationfilm.comhttps://www.facebook.com/BreakingIsolationFilmhttps://www.instagram.com/breaking_isolation_film Thank you so much for all the support!  ------------------- 시놉시스:‘은둔형 외톨이’라고 알려져있는 히키코모리는 주로 사회의 압박으로 인해 몇 달, 혹은 몇 년동안 방에서 고립 상태로 지냅니다. 주변에 의존할 곳이 없는 상태에 이르며 삶의 많은 것을 포기한 채로 지내죠. 하고 싶은 일을 포기해야한다는 압박감과 상실감을 느낀 많은 젊은이들이 사회로부터 등을 돌리고 있습니다. K2하우스는 히키코모리들이 공동체 생활을 하는 곳입니다. K2 멤버들은 함께 지내며 자신감을 회복하고 꿈을 다시 찾아 사회로 나갈 준비를 하죠. 저희는 세 명의 K2멤버의 삶을 들여다보고 무엇이 그들을 고립 상태에 이르게 만들었는지 들어봤습니다. 본인 몸에 대한 수치심부터 하고 싶은 일을 인정해주지 않았던 주변 사람들 이야기까지요. 그들의 회복 과정을 따라다니며 그들이 과거의 상처를 극복하는지, 그리고 어떻게 다시 사회로 돌아오려고 하는지를 조명합니다. 도움이 필요합니다:여러분의 도움은 히키코모리들의 목소리를 세상에 전하는 이 다큐멘터리에 사용됩니다. 영상의 주인공들은 큰 용기를 내어 저희에게 본인들의 엄청난 이야기를 들려줬습니다. 이들의 메시지가 제대로 전달되고 이 청년들 내면의 멋진 모습들을 세상에 공개할 수 있기를 바랍니다.여러분의 도움으로 이 청년들을 위한 아름다운 영상을 만들 것을 약속드립니다.지금까지 영상을 만드는 과정에서의 모든 비용은 저희 사비로 해결했지만, 이 다큐멘터리를 완성시키기 위해서는 15,000달러 (약 1600만원)라는 비용이 들며 여러분의 도움이 필요합니다.모든 자금은 다큐멘터리 제작과 출품을 위해서만 사용됩니다. 음악 작곡과 저작권, 컬러 보정, 최종 편집, 애니메이션, 일러스트, 사운드 디자인과 믹싱을 포함한 모든 포스트 프로덕션 (post-production) 비용으로 사용됩니다.추가 모금은 영화제에 출품하고 홍보 활동에 사용되며 추가 모금의 25%는 K2하우스의 시설을 업그레이드 할 수 있도록 기부금으로 전달됩니다. 중요한 이유:히키코모리와 같은 청년 문제는 세계적으로 일어나고 있으며, 잘 알려지지 않았거나 잘 못 알려진 경우가 있습니다. 특히 사회적 압박으로 인해 누구나 고립될 수 있는 문제입니다.많은 사람들은 히키코모리가 게임을 하고 책임감을 회피하고 싶어서 은둔 생활을 선택해서 한다고 생각합니다. 하지만 사실 그렇지 않죠. 주로 이 청년들은 사회의 규칙과 압력의 영향을 받았으며, 가장 가깝다고 느끼는 주변 사람들이 본인들의 꿈에 대한 신뢰와 지지를 해주지 않았을 때 상처를 받았습니다. 특히 가족과 친구들이 그들의 열정을 무시했을 때 이 청년들은 무너지고는 했죠. 이 다큐멘터리는 히키코모리의 목소리를 전할 뿐만 아니라, 열정을 갖고 꿈을 쫓지만 지쳐가는 모든 사람들에게 메시지를 주고자 합니다. 또한 코로나로 인해 많은 활동들이 제한되며 저희는 몇 달, 혹은 몇 년동안 고립되어 있는게 얼마나 힘든 일인지 조금은 공감될거라 생각합니다.이 청년들에게 목소리를 낼 수 있는 기회 뿐만 아니라 우리 사회의 문제를 돌아보고 고쳐나갈 수 있으면 좋겠습니다. 사회에 어울리지 않는다는 건 벌 받아야 하는게 아니라, 그 다름을 인정받고 이해되어야 하기 때문이죠.  끝으로:저희가 여기까지 온 유일한 이유는 이 청년들에게 영향을 주고 누군가는 그들의 이야기를 들어주고 있다는걸 알려주고 싶어서 입니다. 기부 여부를 떠나서 이 다큐멘터리를 통해 서로에 대한 지지와 공동체의 중요성, 그리고 우리 사회를 돌아보는 기회가 되었으면 좋겠습니다.저희 웹사이트 / 페이스북 / 인스타그램을 통해 더 알아볼 수 있습니다.www.breakingisolationfilm.comhttps://www.facebook.com/BreakingIsolationFilmhttps://www.instagram.com/breaking_isolation_film감사합니다.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey everyone, my name is Sam Eisenhower, and I am the writer, director, and cinematographer for Gemini. I have a background working in visual effects since I was twelve years old, and I have been directing and shooting films for the last five years - anything from narrative thrillers, dramas, and experimental films to music videos and commercials. With this project, I have decided I am ready to pursue my dream of creating something that is fully my own: Gemini.</p>
<p>Gemini is a sci-fi post apocalyptic action thriller film about a man suffering from amnesia trying to find his way back home through a landscape plagued with destruction brought on by androids. These androids are indistinguishable from humans and still roam the apocalyptic countryside. The script has received excellent reviews, scoring an 8.1/10 in the Shore Scripts Short Film Fund Competition. </p>
<p>This film is ultimately about a journey each one of us must face: time. Time moves forward always, it does not move backwards or stand still. No matter how much we may want to go back to the way things were, we can never go back truly. This concept is relevant now more than ever in our society as things have changed rapidly over the last year, for better or worse. The setting of a post-apocalyptic world is the perfect place to explore this concept, and I hope to do so through this film.</p>
<p>I believe that film can be a form of escapism, a way to get away from the stress and pressures of our lives. I also feel that there is a gap between art/indie films and large-scale Hollywood productions; very few Hollywood directors are able to explore deep and intricate concepts, while keeping the audience entertained. In this film, I aim to create a story that is both entertaining and thought-provoking - something that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.</p> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To complete this project to its full potential, we will need at least $15,000. We know that sounds like a lot of money, but this film is highly ambitious. We intend to create an entire world for the characters and audience of the film to inhabit: a shade of the world we live in, full of destruction and chaos. In order to do that, we will need to invest a great deal of money into props, set design, locations, permits, food and accommodations for actors and crew, camera gear, lighting equipment, stunts, and post production/visual effects. All these costs add up very quickly and even with sufficient funds, the scale and ambition of creating this story will be something the world of indie short film cinema has not yet seen.</p> <p>To get you involved in this exciting process, we are offering a number of amazing perks unique to this film: low level contributors will have the opportunity to get their hands on Gemini merchandise such as tee shirts, posters and early access to watch the film before it is officially released. Mid-level contributors will gain access to signed copies of the original Gemini script, deleted scenes from the film, exclusive behind the scenes footage, and much more. And last but not least, high level contributors will be able to get their hands on real, hand-made props from the film, access to all pre-production materials to see what went into the creation of the film, a private video chat with cast and crew, and access to exclusive Gemini merchandise reserved for high-level contributors only!</p>
<p>If we are unable to reach our entire goal, the film will still be made, but it will likely take longer than planned. In addition, we may have to reduce some of the scale, rely more heavily on visual effects and remove some of the stunts, however your contribution will still go directly into the creation of an epic sci-fi story you will not want to miss!</p> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As a filmmaker, it is my goal to bring you into a world that will engage your imagination and give you an experience that will make you think and question the world around you. Our team has created numerous stunning, provocative films in the past, all on extremely minimalistic budgets. We know we can make this film incredible. But with your help, we can make it into something next-level. With your contribution, we can expand this idea into an entire world created by and for you, and create an experience that is immersive, thought-provoking, and entertaining. Your contribution will allow us to construct this world to its fullest potential. Together we can create something incredible.</p> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The process of creating a film does not come without its share of obstacles. I have never created a film or worked on a film that did not have at least one point at which it seemed all was lost. But I can honestly say that I have never given up on something I was passionate about.</p>
<p>I have put months into the research and writing of this film’s script, and I have worked tirelessly to assemble a team, find locations, begin production design, and create materials to promote this project. I believe this film is a perfect expression of a story that I have always wanted to tell, a story that is very personal to me and one I have put my heart and soul into constructing. I could not be more passionate about making this vision a reality with your help. Whatever challenges lie ahead - through a pandemic, social and political unrest, financial obstacles, logistical issues - I have total faith in my team, and we have total faith in each other. I am confident that we will overcome any challenges we may face.</p>
<br/><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that you may not be able to contribute financially, however there are plenty of other ways you can contribute! Sharing this page with your friends and asking others to share our page is a huge help. We hope to reach a wide audience with this project, and spreading the word about our page greatly helps us accomplish that goal.</p>

As a filmmaker, it is my goal to bring you into a world that will engage your imagination and give you an experience that will make you think and question the world around you. Our team has created numerous stunning, provocative films in the past, all on extremely minimalistic budgets. We know we can make this film incredible. But with your help, we can make it into something next-level. With your contribution, we can expand this idea into an entire world created by and for you, and create an experience that is immersive, thought-provoking, and entertaining. Your contribution will allow us to construct this world to its fullest potential. Together we can create something incredible. Risks & Challenges
The process of creating a film does not come without its share of obstacles. I have never created a film or worked on a film that did not have at least one point at which it seemed all was lost. But I can honestly say that I have never given up on something I was passionate about.
I have put months into the research and writing of this film’s script, and I have worked tirelessly to assemble a team, find locations, begin production design, and create materials to promote this project. I believe this film is a perfect expression of a story that I have always wanted to tell, a story that is very personal to me and one I have put my heart and soul into constructing. I could not be more passionate about making this vision a reality with your help. Whatever challenges lie ahead - through a pandemic, social and political unrest, financial obstacles, logistical issues - I have total faith in my team, and we have total faith in each other. I am confident that we will overcome any challenges we may face.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Carson Bailey. I am a Writer and Director who is currently getting my Master of Fine Arts degree at the Savannah College of Art and Design. When I make films, what I want most of all is to simply entertain. If someone breaks a smile watching my movies, I've accomplished my goals! </p>
<p>This campaign is the culmination of everything I have learned in my time making films, and its story is incredibly important to me personally. My biggest problem while coming of age was my aimlessness. I remember pursuing higher education not because I wanted to, but because it just seemed like what was expected of me. Meanwhile I'd had yet to have a real job, and showed almost no drive to improve myself. Slowly but surely the world was leaving me behind, and if I hadn't found my passion and wildly pursued it, it might have done so. This story is about Charlie, a boy trapped in a man's body due to his extended time in a coma, who wakes up from his perfect world, and must adapt to a world that has already left him behind. This story is important to me because it's my worst fears realized, and also a triumph over them.  </p>
<p>By donating to this project you will be helping us find the right actors to bring these characters to life, proper locations for them to act in, and the ability to transport our cast and crew from place to place. In short, this film cannot be fully realized without your help! </p>

<li>Have a specialized crew member to monitor our set's well being. </li>
<li>Keep track of where our cast and crew have been.</li>

<p><i><strong>It’s June, 2012. The Afghanistan War is still raging. The Euros have just started and the nation is gripped by pre-Olympic fever. </strong></i></p>
<p><i><strong>The recession is biting hard and Emily and Oliver have decided to downsize and shift their middle-class lifestyle to a small town in the north of England. They want to live, work and raise their children among what they term “real people”, away from the cold anonymity of London.</strong></i></p>
<p><i><strong>So these left-wing, well-educated people have invited over their two new (very real) neighbours in an attempt to break the ice. Tonight Alan and Dawn are to be offered olives and introduced to Karl Marx and abstract art.</strong></i></p>
<p><i><strong>As classes and outlooks collide, the scene is set for an evening which will have consequences as hilarious as they are tragic.</strong></i></p>
<p>Hello, I am Samantha Seager and I am one of the producers of the film Invincible. </p>
<p>I played Dawn in the original cast of Invincible, which premiered at the Orange Tree Theatre, Richmond in 2014 before transferring to the St. James Theatre in the West End shortly after.</p>
<p>I loved this piece so much and often thought it would make a brilliant film. Not only does the story resonate with me personally (what with me being a lassie from up North), this piece explores subjects which we can all relate to. Torben Betts, the award-winning playwright behind the project, puts cultural and class contradictions in a room together over one night and, inevitably, hilarious and excruciating sparks fly.</p>
<p>But Invincible is infinitely more subtle than pitting ‘rich’ and ‘poor’ against each other. The characters are exceptionally well-developed, believable souls that begin to emerge, demonstrating how government policy affects people from different socio-economic backgrounds. It is also a piece about neighbourliness, kindness, war, fighting for your country and the consequences of not being truthful with one’s self. </p>
<p>Next year, 2022, will be ten years on since our story was set and it has unnervingly predicted many of the events that have happened since. The themes around isolation and loneliness are more poignant than ever, and now feels like the perfect time to look back at the 'halcyon' days of 2012 to see how far (or not) we have come. </p>
<p>Having gathered together the original cast along with writer Torben Betts (making his acting debut as Oliver), and talented actor/director Emma Croft (on board as our Director/Co-Producer), we are in the process of building a first class production team to bring this touching story to the silver screen as a feature film.</p>
<p>Here are some <a href=""https://torbenbetts.wixsite.com/torben-betts/invincible"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">reviews</a> of the original play.</p>
<p>We already have the backing of comedy legend Paul Whitehouse, who is on board as an Executive Producer, but we need more help!  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>FUNDING</strong></p>
<p>We have so far developed this film with £5,000 of our own investment - 16% of the £30,000 we need. </p>
<p>This is a passion project for us and we're hoping to convince you that this project and its team are worth supporting. Raising the remainder of the budget here on Indiegogo would mean everything to this us, enabling us to bring this multi-layered story to life in a way that is thought-provoking and wonderfully entertaining.</p>

<p>Having worked with our Director, Emma Croft, as a Producer’s Assistant on several of Emma’s short films, Michelle has joined the Invincible team as Assistant Producer.</p>

Michelle is passionate about sustainability and is responsible for our journey to secure <i>albert</i> Sustainable Certification for this production.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>BUDGET</strong></p>
<p>Now, time for the numbers. 14 days’ shooting, 1 location, 1 director, 4 cast, 8 crew, and £30,000. That is what is required to create this film.</p>
<p>The money raised through this campaign will go towards a wonderful set design, creating a realistic living room set integral to the story’s development; paying our cast and crew; and hiring of camera, sound, and lighting equipment.</p>
<p>Given this is a passion project, many of us are working for free to make our crowdfunding goal as attainable as possible. We hope you will support us to raise the finances so we can make this vision a reality. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</strong></p>
<p>This is a highly ambitious project and we wouldn't have it any other way. We all have considerable experience in the industry and many of us were involved in the original creation of the piece and have an inherent love and affection for it. </p>
<p>The main challenge is adapting a play for screen and we have already put in a huge amount of time developing the script and setting up the film to date. The film takes place in one location which is why we need the most perfect production design to create a living room set that can facilitate the story telling and make it cinematic. </p>
<p>We are confident that we can overcome these obstacles. It's part of what makes filmmaking so exhilarating.</p>
<p>It whittles down to the fact that one of the biggest challenges is actually raising the money in the first place. This is why we need your help. With your contribution, we'll be able to realise this project through our dedication, tenacity, and fervour to face these risks and challenges.</p>

<p>Indiegogo is a great opportunity for up-and-coming filmmakers and creative entrepreneurs to come together, back projects and set ourselves free from the traditional gatekeepers. We have put together an array of rewards that we hope will excite and entertain you.</p>
<p>We only want people donating what they can live without - the price of a coffee, a beer, a yoga class or dinner out, whether that's £10, £25 or £50 - crowdfunding films is about the many giving a little - rather than anyone giving a lot.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>GOAL</strong></p>
<p>We already have amassed 16% of the budget and we're confident we'll be able to raise the remainder of the budget here. It’s worth acknowledging that, in the circumstance we are unsuccessful in reaching our goal, don't worry, we'll still be making this film. It just means we’ll be pushing our creativity to the limit, reimagining some of our scenes, to ensure we produce the brilliant film that we have planned.</p>

</div></div>","It’s June, 2012. The Afghanistan War is still raging. The Euros have just started and the nation is gripped by pre-Olympic fever. 
The recession is biting hard and Emily and Oliver have decided to downsize and shift their middle-class lifestyle to a small town in the north of England. They want to live, work and raise their children among what they term “real people”, away from the cold anonymity of London.
So these left-wing, well-educated people have invited over their two new (very real) neighbours in an attempt to break the ice. Tonight Alan and Dawn are to be offered olives and introduced to Karl Marx and abstract art.
As classes and outlooks collide, the scene is set for an evening which will have consequences as hilarious as they are tragic.
Hello, I am Samantha Seager and I am one of the producers of the film Invincible. 
I played Dawn in the original cast of Invincible, which premiered at the Orange Tree Theatre, Richmond in 2014 before transferring to the St. James Theatre in the West End shortly after.
I loved this piece so much and often thought it would make a brilliant film. Not only does the story resonate with me personally (what with me being a lassie from up North), this piece explores subjects which we can all relate to. Torben Betts, the award-winning playwright behind the project, puts cultural and class contradictions in a room together over one night and, inevitably, hilarious and excruciating sparks fly.
But Invincible is infinitely more subtle than pitting ‘rich’ and ‘poor’ against each other. The characters are exceptionally well-developed, believable souls that begin to emerge, demonstrating how government policy affects people from different socio-economic backgrounds. It is also a piece about neighbourliness, kindness, war, fighting for your country and the consequences of not being truthful with one’s self. 
Next year, 2022, will be ten years on since our story was set and it has unnervingly predicted many of the events that have happened since. The themes around isolation and loneliness are more poignant than ever, and now feels like the perfect time to look back at the 'halcyon' days of 2012 to see how far (or not) we have come. 
Having gathered together the original cast along with writer Torben Betts (making his acting debut as Oliver), and talented actor/director Emma Croft (on board as our Director/Co-Producer), we are in the process of building a first class production team to bring this touching story to the silver screen as a feature film.
Here are some reviews of the original play.
We already have the backing of comedy legend Paul Whitehouse, who is on board as an Executive Producer, but we need more help!  
 
FUNDING
We have so far developed this film with £5,000 of our own investment - 16% of the £30,000 we need. 
This is a passion project for us and we're hoping to convince you that this project and its team are worth supporting. Raising the remainder of the budget here on Indiegogo would mean everything to this us, enabling us to bring this multi-layered story to life in a way that is thought-provoking and wonderfully entertaining.
 
THE TEAM
Actor - Laura Howard 

Laura is probably best known for her time in the long-running British crime-mystery series Midsomer Murders, in which she played John Nettles' daughter, Cully Barnaby, for 12 years. 
Her first major role came in 1992, playing the teenage daughter, Tammy Rokeby, in the BBC comedy series So Haunt Me. She went on to star in the Jack Rosenthal film Eskimo Day, and its sequel, Cold Enough For Snow. 
Her other television credits include Call The Midwife, Cuffs, Young Dracula and The Delivery Man.
Actor - Daniel Copeland  

Daniel’s best known television work includes After Life for Ricky Gervais, King Gary, Worzel Gummidge, Walter, The Day Britain Stopped and, of course, Casualty.
Other roles include Bilbo Baggins in The Hobbit in the West End, Bottom in A Midsummer Night’s Dream for Northampton Theatre, Baloo in The Jungle Book for West Yorkshire Playhouse (now Leeds Playhouse), and most recently Ryan in Pilot Theatre’s award winning production of Noughts and Crosses.
Actor/Writer - Torben Betts

Torben is an award-winning playwright and screenwriter. 
Having read English Language and Literature at the University of Liverpool, Torben trained as a professional actor at Drama Studio London. After several years on the London Fringe, he transitioned to full-time playwright and has now penned more than 20 titles. Apart from a cameo appearance in his own 2014 film (Downhill), this is his first professional acting role in almost thirty years.
Actor/Executive Producer/Producer - Samantha Seager 
Samantha is known for roles in Coronation Street, The Hello Girls, The Lakes, Johnny and The Bomb and Me Too!. She has also appeared in The Bill, Strange, Waterloo Road, Holby City, Casualty, Silent Witness, Doctors, Boy Meets Girl and Little Britain.
Film credits include Neanderthal, Releevo, Doll Factory and the award winning short This is Vanity and it's up coming sequel, Iniquity.
She will be returning to play Marlene in the West End production of Only Fools and Horses: the Musical later this year.
Director/Producer - Emma Croft  

Emma directed the short film Honest Lies, shot over 2 days following a successful Kickstarter campaign, which was shown as part of the London Short Film Festival 2015 at the Hackney Picturehouse. In 2017, she directed herself in the 5 minute short Left Hand Side for the Sci Fi 48hr Film Challenge.
An actor by trade, Emma graduated as ‘Most Outstanding Drama Student’ from the London Studio Centre. Her extensive acting credits in Shakespeare productions, like Christine Edzard’s As You Like It, as well as Smilla’s Sense of Snow and The Winter’s Tale lends her directing style to this dialogue-centric, character driven story. Having raised her son Emma has returned to film and the creative industries in recent years, and is committed to working with like-minded people and collaborating on inspiring, unusual and important projects.  She is passionate about the stories of unheard voices, women’s stories, and difficult subjects being brought to the screen. 
Other recent collaborations include acting in Gabrielle Russell’s short film Falling, and involvement in the Other People’s Kisses segment of the first ever crowd-sourced feature film, 50 Kisses. She has a short experimental film in post-production. 
Executive Producer - Paul Whitehouse

Paul is a multi award winning national treasure! An actor, writer and comedian, Paul has starred in The Fast Show, Harry Enfield and Chums, Harry and Paul, as well as many other films and TV shows over the years. In recent times he has been delighting us all with Mortimer and Whitehouse: Gone Fishing. 
Assistant Producer - Michelle Thérézien

Having worked with our Director, Emma Croft, as a Producer’s Assistant on several of Emma’s short films, Michelle has joined the Invincible team as Assistant Producer.
With a background in investment finance before changing paths to pursue a career in production management, she is our resident numbers whiz, in charge of the budget. Michelle is passionate about sustainability and is responsible for our journey to secure albert Sustainable Certification for this production.
 
BUDGET
Now, time for the numbers. 14 days’ shooting, 1 location, 1 director, 4 cast, 8 crew, and £30,000. That is what is required to create this film.
The money raised through this campaign will go towards a wonderful set design, creating a realistic living room set integral to the story’s development; paying our cast and crew; and hiring of camera, sound, and lighting equipment.
Given this is a passion project, many of us are working for free to make our crowdfunding goal as attainable as possible. We hope you will support us to raise the finances so we can make this vision a reality. 
 
RISKS AND CHALLENGES
This is a highly ambitious project and we wouldn't have it any other way. We all have considerable experience in the industry and many of us were involved in the original creation of the piece and have an inherent love and affection for it. 
The main challenge is adapting a play for screen and we have already put in a huge amount of time developing the script and setting up the film to date. The film takes place in one location which is why we need the most perfect production design to create a living room set that can facilitate the story telling and make it cinematic. 
We are confident that we can overcome these obstacles. It's part of what makes filmmaking so exhilarating.
It whittles down to the fact that one of the biggest challenges is actually raising the money in the first place. This is why we need your help. With your contribution, we'll be able to realise this project through our dedication, tenacity, and fervour to face these risks and challenges.
 

BACKING AND REWARDS 
Indiegogo is a great opportunity for up-and-coming filmmakers and creative entrepreneurs to come together, back projects and set ourselves free from the traditional gatekeepers. We have put together an array of rewards that we hope will excite and entertain you.

The screenplay has been re-written and reviewed multiple times, fine-tuning it to portray exactly what we want. 


Too many Macca's runs? No worries.

<h3>Film Summary</h3>
<p>After returning from a long night shift at the Virginia State Prison in 1968, prison guard, Stan Ailor comes home to the gruesome scene of the murders of his wife and son. Three years later, Officer Ailor is still seen working his job at the prison. The prison warden, Dawson approaches Stan and gives him the news of a strange request. An inmate on death row requests to eat his final meal with Stan, in which he accepts the invitation. In the observation room we see Kenneth Ailor, the man who killed Stan’s wife and son patiently waiting for his brother to sit and dine with him. Dawson and a few guards watch through a two way mirror. Stan sits and stares at his cold blooded killer of a brother. The prison chef brings in their food, a southern-style meal. They begin to dine. The two converse back and forth, bringing up the past and events of the future. Kenneth talks about his time in his cell, disturbingly observing his brother while on the clock. Tension rises in the room as the two start discussing what exactly happened the night of the murders. Stan starts to lose it. As Kenneth says his final smart remark, Stan finally gets the revenge he's been longing for.</p>

Writer Isaac Pelayo and I are in the pursuit of creating content packed with emotion and impact. How many times have we seen a flashy movie or a repetitive show for us to watch, only to push into a dark corner of our mind, never to be thought of again. We want our audience to not just be entertained, but to feel connected to our film and to share a greater message. </p>

<p>For this project, we want to spread a message of self-worth and inspiration, a topic that we hold near and dear for ourselves. It's very easy to slip into a mind-set in life that you are not ENOUGH. That your insecurities and flaws make you insignificant. However we want to share that you are ENOUGH and that your true friends and family will love you for who you are. </p>

<p>For those of you still reading and who are wondering why the writer and I share the same last name, its because we are in fact brothers!

SEFF16 was a success and we want it to continue as an annual event.

SEFF16 played 50 films from across the world. 15 of those 50 were from South Dakota filmmakers. 8 came from filmmakers within the region,
SEFF17 is focusing heavily on South Dakota filmmakers and South Dakota made films. We love Sioux Falls and we love South Dakota, and want more people to see the talented filmmakers from the area.
Support the arts! Filmmaking is an art and more people need to see that filmmaking is a vibrant growing community within Sioux Falls and South Dakota.

<p><strong>A Very Brief History of 'Ōahi</strong></p>
<p>The 'Ōahi ceremony is a traditional Hawaiian fire-throwing ceremony dating back to ancient times, performed by a select few and shrouded in secrecy. In the darkness of night, the chosen fire throwers would perform this ritual from the mountain peaks overlooking the ocean on the Napali coast and the spectators in the heiau (temple) below. There are accounts of this ritual in old text.</p>
<p>'Ōahi was known to the other islands and is a proud tradition unique to Kauai. There are many legends including the tale of the great fire throwing boy which the Menehune has immortalized and continues to tell at Limahuli Gardens on one of their many tours.</p>
<p>Due to the outside influences, from religious missionaries to foreign governments, the art form was all but lost, however, a select few practitioners retained the knowledge and practiced in secrecy, until now.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Documentary Synopsis</strong> (30-60 min film)</p>

</div></div>","A Very Brief History of 'Ōahi
The 'Ōahi ceremony is a traditional Hawaiian fire-throwing ceremony dating back to ancient times, performed by a select few and shrouded in secrecy. In the darkness of night, the chosen fire throwers would perform this ritual from the mountain peaks overlooking the ocean on the Napali coast and the spectators in the heiau (temple) below. There are accounts of this ritual in old text.
'Ōahi was known to the other islands and is a proud tradition unique to Kauai. There are many legends including the tale of the great fire throwing boy which the Menehune has immortalized and continues to tell at Limahuli Gardens on one of their many tours.
Due to the outside influences, from religious missionaries to foreign governments, the art form was all but lost, however, a select few practitioners retained the knowledge and practiced in secrecy, until now.
 
Documentary Synopsis (30-60 min film)
On the North Shore of the island of Kauai in the Hawaiian Islands, Moku Chandler, a native in his mid-thirties, and his family seek to revitalize the all-but-lost ancient art form of fire throwing, and the 'ŌAHI ceremony. The ancestry of Moku and MokuBoi, his son, goes back to the Hawaiians deep within the Na Pali coast. It is there that 'Ōahi was born and it is there it will be brought back.
Makana Ridge is the gateway to the Na Pali Coast and one of the most sacred places in all of the world -- a true vortex. MokuBoi, a way-finder and crew member of Hokulea on several legs of the Malama Honua tour, will be there in Hanalei to greet our documentary crew and formally invite them to his ceremony. We follow Moku from the prep and through the ceremony all the way through the departure of Hokulea and Moku returning to his life on the land and sea of Kauai.
 
What We Need & What You Get
The ask is $12,000 dollars for for cameras, operators, sound, transportation, food and housing to help us follow Moku on his journey.
While we could use twice as much, we know we can pull it off for $12,000 if necessary and we wanted to set an attainable goal.
Traditionally, we would have needed helicopters and film to get this done, but we have drones and memory cards now so it's much more doable. What would have taken National Geographic $300,000 to do in the ‘80s, we can do for $12,000 now.
We are up against the clock and this budget, but with the favors and the aloha we are feeling, this shouldn't be a problem.
With Hokulea potentially involved, the exact dates become harder to pin down. However, with a little budget help we can ensure success by covering expenses for extra days, preparation and surrounding interviews.
What you will get out of this (besides your very own BluRay of this documentary to keep forever)? The satisfaction that you had a hand in documenting and preserving history at this pivotal point in time and it would not have happened without you. Mahalo Nui Loa!!!
 
The Impact
With so much secrecy and mystique around the ancient 'Ōahi ceremony, very little is known about it. Moku and his son are two of the only people left on Earth with this knowledge. We must make a record for all times. Until now the 'Ōahi has been waiting in the darkness to burn brightly again. The resurrection of the OAHI is one of Moku's life's missions.
We get to show the world one of the most unique stories ever told.
Local Hawaiians get to preserve their culture by telling their own authentic story.
We’re making positive programming with a positive impact.
 
Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:
We are looking for places to house crew.
We need to transport lots of people, so rides are a big help.
Hungry starving artists alway appreciate an unexpected meal if you got extra food.
We are always happy to have help lugging gear and to keep the good times rolling. Let us know if you are local and would like to help pitch in. Any type of aloha is welcome.

<h3>My story</h3>
<p>My name is Jhon Jimenez, and I am the director of this film project. I am a professional classical guitarist with vast experience in the field of photography and video production. In 2014, I co-founded the music web channel specialized in classical guitar, Guitar TV World, with my friend and colleague Luciano Marziali, an Italian guitarist and sound engineer. Together, we are leading Guitar TV World, working in close collaboration with professional journalists, translators and moderators to develop a high-quality audiovisual project, which will enable us to present our instrument to as many people as possible around the world.</p>

<h3>Thema</h3>
<p>The documentary tells the story of the lives of Antonio Lauro and Alirio Díaz, of their collaboration and of their magnificent contribution to the repertoire of classical guitar music. It documents at the same time the vast richness and diversity of the Venezuelan culture. The film shows the interesting and inspiring biography of Alirio Diaz, a man born into a family of farmers and into poverty, who became one of the greatest legends and most influential figures in the history of classical guitar!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The impact of this project</h3>
<p>History helps us understand social and cultural processes, makes us aware of where we come from and helps us define where we are going. It helps us understand the world in which we live. This documentary project is the first in a series dedicated to the preservation and dissemination of the memory of the classical guitar. That's why our project is fundamentally important!</p>
<p>Additionally, this project includes the production of music videos with exceptional artists who perform works by Antonio Lauro and arrangements by Alirio Díaz. Some of these works are hardly known and have never been professionally produced in a video. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p>- Marisela for Harph (A. Lauro)</p>
<p>- Suite venezolana for piano (A. Lauro)</p>
<p>- Variations on a Venezulean children's song (for guitar, A. Lauro)</p>
<p>- Mariquita for two guitars (A. Lauro)</p>
<p>- Canzoni napoletane  (Transcription Alirio Díaz)</p>

<h3>WHERE ARE THE FUNDS GOING?</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511510736/y1uafe7iygsxpbyw54uy.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>30% - Traveling:</strong> This will cover the cost of traveling to places in which the remaining interviews will be conducted to finish filming the documentary: these are in Mexico, the UK, Spain, Greece, Germany and Austria. We will use low cost airlines and will also need funds to cover accommodation and meals.</p>
<p><strong>25% Post production:</strong> Post-production is one of the most important (and longest!) phases of creating a film. It usually takes longer than the actual filming process because it includes editing, color correction, soundtrack recording, synchronization, color grading, voice over recording and more.</p>
<p><strong>18%  Music videoclips productions</strong>: This project also includes the production of music videos with renowned artists! This percentage will cover the rental of professional filming equipment, professional audio recording and transportation costs for the artists with whom the musical productions will be made.</p>
<p><strong>10% Translation and subtitling:</strong> We want our project to be accessible to an international audience: for this reason, we will make the documentary available in Spanish, English and German!</p>
<p><strong>3% - Perks: </strong>This percentage will be destined to the production of rewards for this campaign</p>
<p><strong>5% - Taxes:</strong> The Indiegogo funds are seen as a form of income. Subsequently, the government takes its cut.</p>
<p><strong>5% - Indiegogo fee:</strong> Indiegogo charges a 5% for its services.</p>
<p><strong>4% - Transactions:</strong> Unfortunately Indiegogo does not offer a PayPal or Debit Cards option. The credit card fee is 3% + 0.30 € per transaction + a one-time 25,- € transfer fee. Please contact me if you have any trouble with the payment process.</p>
<h3>Planning</h3>
<p><strong>When will the movie be made?</strong> Production for Rastros Indelebles (Indelible Traces) began in October 2016. For the second phase of the film production, shootings of interviews with leading personalities in the realm of classical guitar are planned during the first quarter of 2018 in Europe. During the second quarter of 2018, post-production, translation and subtitling will be completed.</p>
<p><strong>When will the movie be released?</strong> Although we do not have an exact date locked in yet, we plan to release the documentary film at the end of 2018.</p>
</div><div>

<h3>Risks &amp; challenges</h3>
<p>We are so convinced of the importance of this project that we started it with our own funds, and have already invested a lot of time and energy on it. We also obtained the support of institutions in Venezuela and Germany, which allowed us to produce some of the music videos. However, a project of this magnitude requires a greater investment to be able to finish it in the planned time. Our goal is to raise 20,000 Euros - it is a flexible goal which means every Euro counts to advance the project.</p>
<p>If we reach our campaign goal, we will be able to finish the shootings as planned. Otherwise, the production time will have to be significantly lengthened.</p>

<h3>Mi historia</h3>
<p>Mi nombre es Jhon Jimenez y estoy a cargo de este proyecto. Soy guitarrista clásico profesional y con una vasta experiencia en el campo de la fotografía y la producción audiovisual. En 2014, junto con mi amigo y colega, el guitarrista italiano y técnico de sonido  Luciano Marziali, creamos Guitar TV World, un canal de música web especializado en guitarra clásica. Trabajamos en estrecha colaboración con profesionales de otras áreas, como periodismo, traducción y moderación, y decidimos unir nuestras habilidades con el objetivo de desarrollar un proyecto audiovisual que nos permitiera presentar la guitarra clásica a la mayor cantidad de gente posible a nivel internacional y con altos estándares de calidad!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Nuestro trabajo</h3>
<p>Si está interesado en conocer nuestras producciones, lo invito a visitar la página web de Guitar TV World y a disfrutar de nuestro trabajo!  <a href=""http://www.gtvw.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.gtvw.net</a> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Tema</h3>
<p><br/>El documental ""Rastros Indelebles"" se enfoca en el inmenso legado que los Maestros Antonio Lauro y Alirio Díaz hicieron al repertorio de la guitarra clásica mediante la difusión de la música folklórica y tradicional venezolana, documenta además el impacto de estos dos artistas en la escena guitarrística internacional actual, se abordan las biografías de los personajes, mostrando su lado humano al mismo tiempo que se describirá la bella e inspiradora historia de cómo Alirio Díaz, de origen campesino, humilde y de muy escasos recursos logra consolidarse como una figura legendaria y de gran influencia en la historia de la guitarra clásica!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Importancia de este proyecto documental</h3>
<p>La historia nos ayuda a entender  procesos socioculturales, nos hace tomar conciencia de nuestra procedencia y nos ayuda a definir hacia dónde vamos y de la misma manera nos ayuda a entender el mundo en el que vivimos. Este proyecto documental es el primero de una serie dedicada a preservar y difundir la memoria histórica de la guitarra clásica. ¡En este aspecto radica fundamentalmente la vital importancia de nuestro proyecto! Por otro lado, éste incluye además la producción profesional de videos musicales con artistas excepcionales de renombre mundial, quienes interpretan obras de Antonio Lauro y arreglos de Alirio Díaz. Algunas de estas obras son poco conocidas y nunca se han producido profesionalmente en video. A continuación  algunas de estas piezas musicales:</p>
<p>- Marisela para Harpa (A. Lauro)</p>
<p>- Suite venezolana para piano (A. Lauro)</p>
<p>- Variaciones sobre una canción infantil (para guitarra, A. Lauro)</p>
<p>- Mariquita (Merengue para dos guitarras, A. Lauro)</p>
<p>- Canciones populares napolitanas (selección / Transcripción: Alirio Díaz)</p>

<p><strong>¿Cuándo se hará el documental?</strong> La producción de Rastros Indelebles comenzó en Octubre de 2016. Para la segunda fase de producción, se planean futuros rodajes en Europa durante el primer trimestre de 2018, donde se realizarán entrevistas a personalidades destacadas en el ámbito de la guitarra clásica. Durante el segundo trimestre de 2018, se completará la postproducción, la traducción y el subtitulado.</p>
<p><strong>¿Cuándo será la premier del documental?</strong> Aunque aún no tenemos una fecha exacta definida, planeamos el lanzamiento del documental a finales de 2018. Les informaremos en cuanto sea definida la fecha exacta del release.</p>
<h3>
<br/>Riesgos y desafíos</h3>
<p>Estamos tan convencidos de la importancia de este proyecto que lo comenzamos con nuestros propios fondos, invirtiendo en él además de nuestro dinero, nuestro tiempo y energía. También hemos obtenido el apoyo de instituciones en Venezuela y Alemania, esto nos permitió producir algunos de los videos musicales planeados. Sin embargo, un proyecto de esta magnitud requiere una mayor inversión para poder ser llevado a buen término en el tiempo planificado. Nuestro objetivo es recaudar 20,000 Euros en esta campaña, es un objetivo flexible, ya que sus contribuciones nos ayudarán a avanzar en este proyecto, ¡eso significa que cada Euro cuenta! Si alcanzamos nuestro objetivo en esta campaña de crowdfunding, podríamos terminar los trabajos de filmación y post producción tal como se planeó, de lo contrario, tendremos que alargar significativamente el tiempo de producción.</p>

<h3>Meine Geschichte</h3>
<p>Mein Name ist Jhon Jimenez und ich leite dieses Projekt. Ich bin professioneller klassischer Gitarrist, zugleich ausgerüstet mit umfassender Erfahrung im Bereich Fotografie und audiovisueller Produktion. Gemeinsam mit meinem Freund und Kollegen, dem italienischen Gitarristen und Tontechniker Luciano Marziali, habe ich 2014 Guitar TV World gegründet, ein auf klassische Gitarre spezialisierter Internet-Musiksender. Wir arbeiten eng mit Fachleuten aus verschiedenen Disziplinen zusammen (Journalismus, Übersetzung und Moderation). Wir haben uns für Zusammenarbeit ins Leben gerufen, um dem internationalen Publikum eine neuartige, qualitativ hochwertige, audiovisuelle Erfahrung rund um die klassische Gitarre anzubieten, und um gleichzeitig die Gitarre international möglichst vielen Menschen mit höchstem Qualitätsstandard zu präsentieren.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Unsere Arbeit</h3>
<p>Wenn Sie sich für unsere Arbeit interessieren, lade ich Sie ein, die Website von Guitar TV World zu besuchen und unsere Produktionen zu genießen! <a href=""http://www.gtvw.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.gtvw.net</a></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Thema</h3>
<p>Der Dokumentarfilm “Rastros indelebles” erzählt die Lebensgeschichte Von Antonio Lauro und Alirio Díaz, über deren Zusammenarbeit und ihren enormer Beitrag zum klassischen Gitarrenrepertoire. Er dokumentiert zugleich den enormen Reichtum und die Vielfalt der venezolanischen Kultur. Der Film zeigt die interessante und inspirierende Biographie von Alirio Díaz und wie ein Mensch, der aus einer Bauernfamilie und aus ärmlichsten Verhältnissen stammt, zu einer legendären und einflussreichen Figur in der Geschichte der Klassischen Gitarre geworden ist.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Warum ist dieses Dokumentarfilmprojekt wichtig? </h3>
<p>Die Geschichte hilft uns, sozio-kulturelle Prozesse zu verstehen. Sie macht uns über unsere eigene Herkunft bewusst und hilft uns zu definieren, wohin wir gehen, und auf dieselbe Weise hilft sie uns, die Welt, in der wir leben, zu verstehen. Dieses Dokumentarfilm-Projekt ist das erste einer Reihe, die sich der Bewahrung und Verbreitung des historischen Gedächtnisses der klassischen Gitarre widmet. In diesem Aspekt liegt die grundlegende Bedeutung unseres Projekts! Auf der anderen Seite beinhaltet dieses Projekt auch professionelle Produktion von Musikvideos mit außergewöhnlichen international renommierten Künstlern, welche die Werke von Antonio Lauro und Arrangements von Alirio Díaz aufnehmen werden. Einige dieser Werke sind wenig bekannt und wurden nie professionell im Videoformat produziert. Hier sind einige dieser musikalischen Werke:</p>
<p>- Marisela für Harfe (A. Lauro)</p>
<p>- Venezolanische Suite für Klavier (A. Lauro)</p>
<p>- Variationen über ein venezolanisches Kinderlied (für Gitarre, A. Lauro)</p>
<p>- Mariquita (Merengue für zwei Gitarren, A. Lauro)</p>
<p>- Canzoni napoletane (Auswahl / Transkription: Alirio Díaz)</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>30% Reisekosten:</strong> Dieser Prozentsatz ermöglicht es uns, die Reisekosten zu decken, um die restlichen Interviews zu beenden und damit die Drehphase der Dokumentarfilm abzuschließen. Wir planen Interviews in Mexiko, Großbritannien, Spanien, Griechenland, Deutschland und Österreich. Da wir in Deutschland unsere Sitz haben, können wir Billigfluggesellschaften nutzen, aber natürlich müssen die Kosten für Unterkunft und Verpflegung gedeckt werden.</p>
<p><strong>25% Postproduktion:</strong> Die Postproduktion ist eine der wichtigsten Phasen des audiovisuellen Schaffens. Im Allgemeinen dauert es mehr Zeit als die Drehphase und kann mehrere Monate in Anspruch nehmen, da es das Editing, die Aufnahme der Soundtracks, die Synchronisation, die Farbkorrektur, die Aufnahme des Erzählers (voice over) usw. beinhaltet.</p>
<p><strong>18% Musikvideoclips:</strong> Dieser Prozentsatz hilft uns die Kosten für den Verleih von Filmausrüstung, die professioneller Audioaufnahme und die Transportkosten der Künstler, mit denen die Musikproduktionen für dieses Projekt durchgeführt werden zu decken.</p>
<p><strong>10% Übersetzung und Untertitelung:</strong> Unser Ziel ist es, unser Projekt einem großen internationalen Publikum zugänglich zu machen. Aus diesem Grund wollen wir, dass der Dokumentarfilm in Spanisch, Englisch und Deutsch verfügbar ist.</p>
<p><strong>3% Perks:</strong> Dieser Prozentsatz ist für die Produktion von Prämien für diese Kampagne bestimmt.</p>
<p><strong>5% Steuern:</strong> Die Mittel, die durch diese Kampagne gesammelt werden, zählen gesetzlich als Einkommen, welches der Steuerpflicht unterliegt.</p>
<p><strong>5% Indiegogo Gebühr:</strong> Indiegogo ist eine großartige Plattform der Verbreitung, aber natürlich kostet es Geld, ihre Dienste zu nutzen.</p>
<p><strong>4% Kreditkartengebühren und Überweisung:</strong> Da Indiegogo leider keine Zahlungsmöglichkeit per PayPal oder Debitkarte anbietet, müssen Spenden per Kreditkarte geleistet werden. 4% der eingenommenen Mittel brauchen wir für die Bezahlung von Transaktionen über Kreditkarten und Überweisung (3% + 0,30 € pro Transaktion + 25, - € Überweisung).</p>
<p><br/> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Planung</strong></p>
<p><strong>Wann wird der Dokumentarfilm gemacht?</strong> Die Produktion von ""Rastros Indelebles"" (unauslöschliche Spuren) begann im Oktober 2016. Für die zweite Produktionsphase sind in Europa im ersten Quartal 2018 weitere Shootings geplant, bei denen Interviews mit herausragenden Persönlichkeiten im Bereich der klassischen Gitarre durchgeführt werden. Im zweiten Quartal 2018 sollen Postproduktion, Übersetzung und Untertitelung abgeschlossen sein.</p>
<p><strong>Wann wird die Premiere des Dokumentarfilms sein?</strong> Obwohl wir noch kein genaues Datum haben, planen wir die Veröffentlichung des Dokumentarfilms Ende 2018. Wir werden Sie informieren, sobald den Termin für die Premiere festgelegt wird.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risiken und Herausforderungen</h3>
<p>Wir sind von der Bedeutung dieses Projekts so überzeugt, dass wir es mit eigenen Mitteln gestartet haben. Wir haben nicht nur eigenes Geld sondern auch, unserere Zeit und Energie in dieses Projekt investiert. Glücklicherweise haben wir die Unterstützung von Institutionen in Venezuela und Deutschland bekommen (Hochschule für Musik und Tanz Köln, Rheinische Musikschule Köln, National Philharmonisches Orchestra Venezuelas, u.a.), so dass wir einige Musikvideos produzieren konnten, aber ein Projekt dieser Größenordnung braucht eine größere Investition. Unser Ziel ist es, 20.000 Euro in dieser Kampagne zu sammeln und Ihre Beiträge werden uns helfen, in diesem Projekt weiter voranzukommen, das bedeutet, dass jeder Euro zählt! Wenn wir unser Ziel in dieser Crowdfunding-Kampagne erreichen, könnten wir die Dreh- und Postproduktionsarbeiten wie geplant beenden, ansonsten müssen wir die Produktionszeit drastisch verlängern.</p>

My story
My name is Jhon Jimenez, and I am the director of this film project. I am a professional classical guitarist with vast experience in the field of photography and video production. In 2014, I co-founded the music web channel specialized in classical guitar, Guitar TV World, with my friend and colleague Luciano Marziali, an Italian guitarist and sound engineer. Together, we are leading Guitar TV World, working in close collaboration with professional journalists, translators and moderators to develop a high-quality audiovisual project, which will enable us to present our instrument to as many people as possible around the world.
 
Where can you see our work?
If you are interested in learning more about our previous productions, visit Guitar TV World at www.gtvw.net!
 
Thema
The documentary tells the story of the lives of Antonio Lauro and Alirio Díaz, of their collaboration and of their magnificent contribution to the repertoire of classical guitar music. It documents at the same time the vast richness and diversity of the Venezuelan culture. The film shows the interesting and inspiring biography of Alirio Diaz, a man born into a family of farmers and into poverty, who became one of the greatest legends and most influential figures in the history of classical guitar!
 
The impact of this project
History helps us understand social and cultural processes, makes us aware of where we come from and helps us define where we are going. It helps us understand the world in which we live. This documentary project is the first in a series dedicated to the preservation and dissemination of the memory of the classical guitar. That's why our project is fundamentally important!
Additionally, this project includes the production of music videos with exceptional artists who perform works by Antonio Lauro and arrangements by Alirio Díaz. Some of these works are hardly known and have never been professionally produced in a video. Here are a few examples:
- Marisela for Harph (A. Lauro)
- Suite venezolana for piano (A. Lauro)
- Variations on a Venezulean children's song (for guitar, A. Lauro)
- Mariquita for two guitars (A. Lauro)
- Canzoni napoletane  (Transcription Alirio Díaz)

WHERE ARE THE FUNDS GOING?

30% - Traveling: This will cover the cost of traveling to places in which the remaining interviews will be conducted to finish filming the documentary: these are in Mexico, the UK, Spain, Greece, Germany and Austria. We will use low cost airlines and will also need funds to cover accommodation and meals.
25% Post production: Post-production is one of the most important (and longest!) phases of creating a film. It usually takes longer than the actual filming process because it includes editing, color correction, soundtrack recording, synchronization, color grading, voice over recording and more.
18%  Music videoclips productions: This project also includes the production of music videos with renowned artists! This percentage will cover the rental of professional filming equipment, professional audio recording and transportation costs for the artists with whom the musical productions will be made.
10% Translation and subtitling: We want our project to be accessible to an international audience: for this reason, we will make the documentary available in Spanish, English and German!
3% - Perks: This percentage will be destined to the production of rewards for this campaign
5% - Taxes: The Indiegogo funds are seen as a form of income. Subsequently, the government takes its cut.
5% - Indiegogo fee: Indiegogo charges a 5% for its services.
4% - Transactions: Unfortunately Indiegogo does not offer a PayPal or Debit Cards option. The credit card fee is 3% + 0.30 € per transaction + a one-time 25,- € transfer fee. Please contact me if you have any trouble with the payment process.
Planning
When will the movie be made? Production for Rastros Indelebles (Indelible Traces) began in October 2016. For the second phase of the film production, shootings of interviews with leading personalities in the realm of classical guitar are planned during the first quarter of 2018 in Europe. During the second quarter of 2018, post-production, translation and subtitling will be completed.
When will the movie be released? Although we do not have an exact date locked in yet, we plan to release the documentary film at the end of 2018.

 
Risks & challenges
We are so convinced of the importance of this project that we started it with our own funds, and have already invested a lot of time and energy on it. We also obtained the support of institutions in Venezuela and Germany, which allowed us to produce some of the music videos. However, a project of this magnitude requires a greater investment to be able to finish it in the planned time. Our goal is to raise 20,000 Euros - it is a flexible goal which means every Euro counts to advance the project.
If we reach our campaign goal, we will be able to finish the shootings as planned. Otherwise, the production time will have to be significantly lengthened.

Mi historia
Mi nombre es Jhon Jimenez y estoy a cargo de este proyecto. Soy guitarrista clásico profesional y con una vasta experiencia en el campo de la fotografía y la producción audiovisual. En 2014, junto con mi amigo y colega, el guitarrista italiano y técnico de sonido  Luciano Marziali, creamos Guitar TV World, un canal de música web especializado en guitarra clásica. Trabajamos en estrecha colaboración con profesionales de otras áreas, como periodismo, traducción y moderación, y decidimos unir nuestras habilidades con el objetivo de desarrollar un proyecto audiovisual que nos permitiera presentar la guitarra clásica a la mayor cantidad de gente posible a nivel internacional y con altos estándares de calidad!
 
Nuestro trabajo
Si está interesado en conocer nuestras producciones, lo invito a visitar la página web de Guitar TV World y a disfrutar de nuestro trabajo!  www.gtvw.net 
 
Tema
El documental ""Rastros Indelebles"" se enfoca en el inmenso legado que los Maestros Antonio Lauro y Alirio Díaz hicieron al repertorio de la guitarra clásica mediante la difusión de la música folklórica y tradicional venezolana, documenta además el impacto de estos dos artistas en la escena guitarrística internacional actual, se abordan las biografías de los personajes, mostrando su lado humano al mismo tiempo que se describirá la bella e inspiradora historia de cómo Alirio Díaz, de origen campesino, humilde y de muy escasos recursos logra consolidarse como una figura legendaria y de gran influencia en la historia de la guitarra clásica!
 
Importancia de este proyecto documental
La historia nos ayuda a entender  procesos socioculturales, nos hace tomar conciencia de nuestra procedencia y nos ayuda a definir hacia dónde vamos y de la misma manera nos ayuda a entender el mundo en el que vivimos. Este proyecto documental es el primero de una serie dedicada a preservar y difundir la memoria histórica de la guitarra clásica. ¡En este aspecto radica fundamentalmente la vital importancia de nuestro proyecto! Por otro lado, éste incluye además la producción profesional de videos musicales con artistas excepcionales de renombre mundial, quienes interpretan obras de Antonio Lauro y arreglos de Alirio Díaz. Algunas de estas obras son poco conocidas y nunca se han producido profesionalmente en video. A continuación  algunas de estas piezas musicales:
- Marisela para Harpa (A. Lauro)
- Suite venezolana para piano (A. Lauro)
- Variaciones sobre una canción infantil (para guitarra, A. Lauro)
- Mariquita (Merengue para dos guitarras, A. Lauro)
- Canciones populares napolitanas (selección / Transcripción: Alirio Díaz)

Cómo serán utilizados los fondos?

 
30% viajes: este porcentaje nos permitirá cubrir los costos de los viajes viaje para completar las entrevistas restantes y de esta manera finalizar la fase de filmación del documental.

25% post producción: La postproducción es una de las fases más importantes en la creación audiovisual. Por lo general, lleva más tiempo que la fase de filmación y puede tardar varios meses en completarse, ya que incluye la edición completa, la grabación de los soud tracks, la sincronización, la graduación de colores, la grabación del narrador, etc.
18% videoclips musicales: Este porcentaje cubrirá el alquiler de equipos de filmación, grabación profesional de audio y los costos de transporte de los artistas con los que se realizarán las producciones musicales para este proyecto.

4% Transacciones:  Dado que  Lamentablemente, Indiegogo no ofrece una opción de pago mediante PayPal o tarjeta de débito, las donaciones deberán realizarse mediante tarjetas de crédito. El 4% de los fondos recaudados se destinará al pago de las transacciones mediante tarjetas de crédito y las transferencias  La tarifa por el uso de tarjeta de crédito es del 3% + 0,30 € por transacción + 25, - € por concepto de transferencia.
 
Planificación
¿Cuándo se hará el documental? La producción de Rastros Indelebles comenzó en Octubre de 2016. Para la segunda fase de producción, se planean futuros rodajes en Europa durante el primer trimestre de 2018, donde se realizarán entrevistas a personalidades destacadas en el ámbito de la guitarra clásica.

Riesgos y desafíos
Estamos tan convencidos de la importancia de este proyecto que lo comenzamos con nuestros propios fondos, invirtiendo en él además de nuestro dinero, nuestro tiempo y energía. También hemos obtenido el apoyo de instituciones en Venezuela y Alemania, esto nos permitió producir algunos de los videos musicales planeados. Sin embargo, un proyecto de esta magnitud requiere una mayor inversión para poder ser llevado a buen término en el tiempo planificado. Nuestro objetivo es recaudar 20,000 Euros en esta campaña, es un objetivo flexible, ya que sus contribuciones nos ayudarán a avanzar en este proyecto, ¡eso significa que cada Euro cuenta! Si alcanzamos nuestro objetivo en esta campaña de crowdfunding, podríamos terminar los trabajos de filmación y post producción tal como se planeó, de lo contrario, tendremos que alargar significativamente el tiempo de producción.

Meine Geschichte
Mein Name ist Jhon Jimenez und ich leite dieses Projekt. Ich bin professioneller klassischer Gitarrist, zugleich ausgerüstet mit umfassender Erfahrung im Bereich Fotografie und audiovisueller Produktion. Gemeinsam mit meinem Freund und Kollegen, dem italienischen Gitarristen und Tontechniker Luciano Marziali, habe ich 2014 Guitar TV World gegründet, ein auf klassische Gitarre spezialisierter Internet-Musiksender. Wir arbeiten eng mit Fachleuten aus verschiedenen Disziplinen zusammen (Journalismus, Übersetzung und Moderation). Wir haben uns für Zusammenarbeit ins Leben gerufen, um dem internationalen Publikum eine neuartige, qualitativ hochwertige, audiovisuelle Erfahrung rund um die klassische Gitarre anzubieten, und um gleichzeitig die Gitarre international möglichst vielen Menschen mit höchstem Qualitätsstandard zu präsentieren.
 
Unsere Arbeit
Wenn Sie sich für unsere Arbeit interessieren, lade ich Sie ein, die Website von Guitar TV World zu besuchen und unsere Produktionen zu genießen! www.gtvw.net
 
Thema
Der Dokumentarfilm “Rastros indelebles” erzählt die Lebensgeschichte Von Antonio Lauro und Alirio Díaz, über deren Zusammenarbeit und ihren enormer Beitrag zum klassischen Gitarrenrepertoire. Er dokumentiert zugleich den enormen Reichtum und die Vielfalt der venezolanischen Kultur. Der Film zeigt die interessante und inspirierende Biographie von Alirio Díaz und wie ein Mensch, der aus einer Bauernfamilie und aus ärmlichsten Verhältnissen stammt, zu einer legendären und einflussreichen Figur in der Geschichte der Klassischen Gitarre geworden ist.
 
Warum ist dieses Dokumentarfilmprojekt wichtig? 
Die Geschichte hilft uns, sozio-kulturelle Prozesse zu verstehen. Sie macht uns über unsere eigene Herkunft bewusst und hilft uns zu definieren, wohin wir gehen, und auf dieselbe Weise hilft sie uns, die Welt, in der wir leben, zu verstehen. Dieses Dokumentarfilm-Projekt ist das erste einer Reihe, die sich der Bewahrung und Verbreitung des historischen Gedächtnisses der klassischen Gitarre widmet. In diesem Aspekt liegt die grundlegende Bedeutung unseres Projekts! Auf der anderen Seite beinhaltet dieses Projekt auch professionelle Produktion von Musikvideos mit außergewöhnlichen international renommierten Künstlern, welche die Werke von Antonio Lauro und Arrangements von Alirio Díaz aufnehmen werden. Einige dieser Werke sind wenig bekannt und wurden nie professionell im Videoformat produziert. Hier sind einige dieser musikalischen Werke:
- Marisela für Harfe (A. Lauro)
- Venezolanische Suite für Klavier (A. Lauro)
- Variationen über ein venezolanisches Kinderlied (für Gitarre, A. Lauro)
- Mariquita (Merengue für zwei Gitarren, A. Lauro)
- Canzoni napoletane (Auswahl / Transkription: Alirio Díaz)

Wie werden die Mittel verwendet?

 
30% Reisekosten: Dieser Prozentsatz ermöglicht es uns, die Reisekosten zu decken, um die restlichen Interviews zu beenden und damit die Drehphase der Dokumentarfilm abzuschließen. Wir planen Interviews in Mexiko, Großbritannien, Spanien, Griechenland, Deutschland und Österreich. Da wir in Deutschland unsere Sitz haben, können wir Billigfluggesellschaften nutzen, aber natürlich müssen die Kosten für Unterkunft und Verpflegung gedeckt werden.
25% Postproduktion: Die Postproduktion ist eine der wichtigsten Phasen des audiovisuellen Schaffens. Im Allgemeinen dauert es mehr Zeit als die Drehphase und kann mehrere Monate in Anspruch nehmen, da es das Editing, die Aufnahme der Soundtracks, die Synchronisation, die Farbkorrektur, die Aufnahme des Erzählers (voice over) usw. beinhaltet.
18% Musikvideoclips: Dieser Prozentsatz hilft uns die Kosten für den Verleih von Filmausrüstung, die professioneller Audioaufnahme und die Transportkosten der Künstler, mit denen die Musikproduktionen für dieses Projekt durchgeführt werden zu decken.
10% Übersetzung und Untertitelung: Unser Ziel ist es, unser Projekt einem großen internationalen Publikum zugänglich zu machen. Aus diesem Grund wollen wir, dass der Dokumentarfilm in Spanisch, Englisch und Deutsch verfügbar ist.
3% Perks: Dieser Prozentsatz ist für die Produktion von Prämien für diese Kampagne bestimmt.
5% Steuern: Die Mittel, die durch diese Kampagne gesammelt werden, zählen gesetzlich als Einkommen, welches der Steuerpflicht unterliegt.
5% Indiegogo Gebühr: Indiegogo ist eine großartige Plattform der Verbreitung, aber natürlich kostet es Geld, ihre Dienste zu nutzen.
4% Kreditkartengebühren und Überweisung: Da Indiegogo leider keine Zahlungsmöglichkeit per PayPal oder Debitkarte anbietet, müssen Spenden per Kreditkarte geleistet werden. 4% der eingenommenen Mittel brauchen wir für die Bezahlung von Transaktionen über Kreditkarten und Überweisung (3% + 0,30 € pro Transaktion + 25, - € Überweisung).
 
 
Planung
Wann wird der Dokumentarfilm gemacht? Die Produktion von ""Rastros Indelebles"" (unauslöschliche Spuren) begann im Oktober 2016. Für die zweite Produktionsphase sind in Europa im ersten Quartal 2018 weitere Shootings geplant, bei denen Interviews mit herausragenden Persönlichkeiten im Bereich der klassischen Gitarre durchgeführt werden. Im zweiten Quartal 2018 sollen Postproduktion, Übersetzung und Untertitelung abgeschlossen sein.
Wann wird die Premiere des Dokumentarfilms sein? Obwohl wir noch kein genaues Datum haben, planen wir die Veröffentlichung des Dokumentarfilms Ende 2018. Wir werden Sie informieren, sobald den Termin für die Premiere festgelegt wird.
 
 
Risiken und Herausforderungen
Wir sind von der Bedeutung dieses Projekts so überzeugt, dass wir es mit eigenen Mitteln gestartet haben. Wir haben nicht nur eigenes Geld sondern auch, unserere Zeit und Energie in dieses Projekt investiert. Glücklicherweise haben wir die Unterstützung von Institutionen in Venezuela und Deutschland bekommen (Hochschule für Musik und Tanz Köln, Rheinische Musikschule Köln, National Philharmonisches Orchestra Venezuelas, u.a.), so dass wir einige Musikvideos produzieren konnten, aber ein Projekt dieser Größenordnung braucht eine größere Investition. Unser Ziel ist es, 20.000 Euro in dieser Kampagne zu sammeln und Ihre Beiträge werden uns helfen, in diesem Projekt weiter voranzukommen, das bedeutet, dass jeder Euro zählt! Wenn wir unser Ziel in dieser Crowdfunding-Kampagne erreichen, könnten wir die Dreh- und Postproduktionsarbeiten wie geplant beenden, ansonsten müssen wir die Produktionszeit drastisch verlängern.

<h3>MoviEst Project</h3>
<p>Fin da piccolo ho sempre avuto la passione per la fotografia, mi piaceva fermare in immagine i bellissimi luoghi che con la scuola s’aveva la fortuna di visitare. Col passare degli anni ho poi visto che le mie emozioni erano più a loro agio se espresse attraverso una telecamera. </p>
<p>Ho iniziato circa 18 anni fa col filmare qualcosa con gli amici del paese. Ci si divertiva tantissimo e son nate così delle amicizie intime molto forti come quella con Alex Gabrici, mia insostituibile spalla.</p>
<p>Dopo anni di prove e di filmati (a detta degli amici) simpatici, è nato il nostro primo lungometraggio nel 2004 “Last lie”, un film poliziesco nei più classici canoni Hollywoodiani.</p>
<p>Abbiamo poi avuto la fortuna di conoscere Francesco Baita durante una produzione documentaristica. Da qui l’idea di un film intitolato “Striaments” (sortilegi) dove il tema principale erano le leggende Friulane intrise di Streghe, figure mistichee tradizioni.</p>
<p>Forte è stato, dopo questa esperienza, il desiderio di legare le nostre sceneggiature e produzioni appunto alle tradizioni e leggende friulane recitate anche nella nostra lingua madre.</p>
<p>L’attuale associazione è nata quando al gruppo si sono uniti Christopher Bertolutti, Daniele Pavinato ed Erica Grattoni, ognuno con le proprie competenze e professionalità. Lavoriamo a stretto contatto con varie Associazioni Storiche che credono fortemente nei nostri progetti. L’ultimo frutto di queste collaborazioni è stato il film “Un Frêt Invièr” “A Cold Winter” del 2015, ambientato in epoca medievale a cui è preceduta un’accurata ricerca storica sulle usanze, fatti, costumi e location.</p>
<p>MoviEst Project nasce dalla voglia di studiare, comprendere, creare, sperimentare e divertirsi, trasponendo il tutto in progetti filmici, senza tralasciare un aspetto per noi molto importante: la divulgazione e la riscoperta delle nostre antiche tradizioni, radici storiche e leggende popolari, fotografate nei luoghi più suggestivi del nord est Italia.</p>

<h3>Le Anime del Fiume</h3>
<p>Il film sarà ambientato tra il 1468 e il 1518 in Veneto e Friuli, in un periodo storico particolarmente difficile tra incursioni dei Turchi e degli Ungari, rivolta dei contadini verso i nobili del 1511 e sempre nel 1511 l’epidemia di peste ed il terremoto che devasterà ampie zone del Friuli.  Tutti questi eventi saranno presenti nel film. </p>
<p>Narra la storia di un uomo che nasce in un villaggio delle colline friulane. La sua vita semplice cambierà drasticamente causa un’epidemia di tifo. Unico sopravvissuto della sua famiglia, creduto morto e lasciato in una fossa comune, viene trovato da un gruppo di uomini e portato in salvo. </p>
<p>Nel 1501 si trasferisce in un’abbazia veneta ove trascorrerà la sua vita tra lavoro e preghiera. Causa un evento particolare l’uomo deciderà di lasciare questo luogo e di intraprendere un cammino a ritroso, verso i suoi luoghi d’origine.

<p>From the director of BLINDED, Official Selection of the International Open Film Festival in New York, we bring you <strong>CHICKEN AND THE ED</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>CHICKEN AND THE ED</strong> is a short musical about Ed, a lost musician who stumbles upon Kevin, an equally lost chicken with whom he finds and unlikely friendship. Through a specially curated soundtrack of popular songs, Ed is forced to choose between Kevin and his neglected 8-year-old son, Ben. Take part in our unique journey to discover what matters more, a stranded feathered companion or his loving human offspring. With this film you'll discover an odyssey of comedy, tragedy, and music in this heart-warming story set in the serene countryside of Dundee, Scotland.</p>
<p>We are a nest of digital film production students, studying at Ravensbourne University, making our graduation film! </p>
<h3>OUR LAST MUSICAL</h3>

<h3><strong>YOU'RE A CRACKER!</strong></h3>
<p>This self-funded production needs your support to turn this bold concept into a reality. CHICKEN AND THE ED will be produced with the professional guidance of top industry filmmakers, in an attempt to break the mould of the comedy-musical genre. Your contribution will allow us free reign to develop this narrative into something truly special. EVERY one of our generous patrons will be acknowledged in the film's end credits, among many other perks offered as part of this campaign.</p>

</div></div>","From the director of BLINDED, Official Selection of the International Open Film Festival in New York, we bring you CHICKEN AND THE ED.
CHICKEN AND THE ED is a short musical about Ed, a lost musician who stumbles upon Kevin, an equally lost chicken with whom he finds and unlikely friendship. Through a specially curated soundtrack of popular songs, Ed is forced to choose between Kevin and his neglected 8-year-old son, Ben. Take part in our unique journey to discover what matters more, a stranded feathered companion or his loving human offspring. With this film you'll discover an odyssey of comedy, tragedy, and music in this heart-warming story set in the serene countryside of Dundee, Scotland.
We are a nest of digital film production students, studying at Ravensbourne University, making our graduation film! 
OUR LAST MUSICAL

Here's the musical we made last year. It was great fun, and we got some great feedback to make our next one bigger and better than before.
 
YOU'RE A CRACKER!
This self-funded production needs your support to turn this bold concept into a reality. CHICKEN AND THE ED will be produced with the professional guidance of top industry filmmakers, in an attempt to break the mould of the comedy-musical genre. Your contribution will allow us free reign to develop this narrative into something truly special. EVERY one of our generous patrons will be acknowledged in the film's end credits, among many other perks offered as part of this campaign.
WHO MAKES A MUSICAL ABOUT A CHICKEN?
Meet the eggtravigent team behind this film, all of whom are freelance filmmakers, tryna' make you laugh.

<h3>Why Another Campaign?</h3>
<p>This is the third campaign for MONSTER with two out of three hitting the goal required at that stage so you might be wondering why we're doing yet another campaign. Hopefully these bullet points will help clear up any confusion!</p>
<ul>
<li>Films are expensive. Matt Shaw sold all of his film merchandise and hit the convention run hard in order to raise more money for the film, to go with the initial funding we received. Unfortunately there is nothing left that he can realistically sell and credit isn't an option. If we don't hit the goal on this campaign, the film WILL be completed (on schedule we hasten to add) but to do so will require the film equipment purchased to be sold off. Why do we want to try and keep the equipment (cameras, lights, sound etc) - simple - we want to carry on making films for you to enjoy!</li>
<li>The funds from this campaign will be going directly on post-production of the film including sound design and editing costs. Because we want the film to look and sound as good as it possibly can, we're not looking at cutting corners to get it done on the cheap. Those of you in the industry will know - this can cost serious money to get right.</li>
<li>If we don't reach the full goal, we will sell off the equipment we have bit by bit until the goal is met. The closer we can get to the goal, the less we need to sell off and the more films you can expect from the same crew of people! Don't think of it as helping one film, think of it as helping many films...<br/> </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Matt Shaw and Michael Bray are mostly disheartened with the state of horror films at the moment. One film will come out and be a success and then multiple copycat films will come out offering nothing knew. Hollywood is quick to remake films with little care and thought and - well, it's a bit of an insult to fans of the genre. Authors by trade, with over 200 titles between them, Shaw and Bray will be looking to adapt numerous titles to bring you more horror and by hitting this goal, it means we walk away from the project with zero debt and all future monies made from sales will go on funding more films. Better yet, they're not just looking at their titles, they're looking at books from all independent authors with the dream of helping more people get from page to screen! Horror needs this. Independent artists need this. <i>We</i> need this.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As already stated, the risk of not hitting the goal basically means we have to sell expensive equipment off to ensure post-production can be completed on time with zero debts. The problem with this is that it will slow progress for a second film and a third and a fourth.... By hitting the goal, we're ready to plow all future investment back into more films.</p>
<p>Thankfully, at this stage, the bulk of the risks and challenges we have faced have already been overcome although that doesn't mean the journey to this stage has been an easy one!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some of you just can't contribute as money is tight (understandable), but that doesn't mean you can't help! Please do share this campaign with your friends via any means possible. The more people we can reach, the more we can raise. And if we raise over £5,000 - simple, the rest of the funds go straight into a second film...</p>

</ol><p>Working Plan as of 11/17/2017</p><p>Channeled by Jean and Alan</p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><p>We have created an associate called ‘Tropical Regeneration’ that will link a global community of beings that want to protect and restore the rainforest. In addition, we will have volunteers, locals, and farmers that contribute to the garden, the association, and the community ie. local schools, community gardens, and workshops. We aim to protect and regenerate the land. The land to establish the homestead and office is 500 square meters that will be a botanical garden, home for volunteers, and office. We will establish a food forest for least 2.5 acres that can satisfice 90% of the food for 10 persons, between the time it takes to establish the food forest, we will grow annual and seasonal crops to satisfice the 50% to 60% of the food. We have a shelter that is our casita and office. It will need to be redesigned for the current systems. We will have rain catchment systems and a well for water needs. The shelter will be built with natural materials from the land and from the local area and recycled material like an earthship. Occasional, we use concrete for the foundation of homes, and use alternative prefabricated roofs. The reason being for long term preservation and emerging of the structure. In our day to day life we will move in the most simple ways such as bicycles and horses, but occasionally we will use a small truck for long trips or farm related activities, this can be transformed to use burn oil (vegetable oil, etc.) in the future. We will offer retreats, Yoga, ceremonies and temazcal practices and some many others environmental workshops to help to develop spiritually and education to share with the different community’s. We aim to develop videos aimed to educated individuals and communities on the ease and benefit for the Earth of the life lifestyle of permaculture.

Permaculture allows one to live independently and respectfully with their environment, providing a healthy foundation for both the Earth and those living with it.What is the Tropical Regeneration Plan?Vision:Regeneration of the life in the tropics and the reconnection of the  Relations between humans and Earth improving the quality of life and happiness of different communities.Mission:Regeneration of the ecosystems using agroforestry. Protecting existential rainforest. improving the quality of life and happiness of different communities.Our principle tool to create this project is permaculture and describe our objectives we will use the permaculture flower starting this Land & nature Stewardship in a clockwise direction.
Land & nature StewardshipImprove the existential casita, office and botanical garden land. Creating nursery, Seed bank, and propagation of seeds, and starting a compost for regeneration of soil. Creation of medical, herbs, and greens gardens. Planting of fruits, veggies, and flowers. Next we will obtain a secondary land that needs regeneration using agroforestry to grow enough food and other services to sustain the project. Later, we will involve investor to help us fund or donate other properties to protect and regenerate.

BuildingsIn the existential property there is a shelter and office area for volunteers and contributors. We will redesign the shelter using natural and local resources reusing some of the existing materials. In the future lands of the project we will build simple shelters that will use natural and local materials.

Tools & TechnologyThe existing shelter have water and electricity from local services and a water toilet with a septic tank and a kitchen with a small gas stove. Many of the systems will be improved and redesigned to use solar electricity, wood burning stove, well water, rain catchment, compost toilet and greywater systems.  In the future shelters of the project they will be improved and redesigned for similar or more simple systems than the existing shelters redesign.

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I'm David Call and I wrote and will be directing and acting in COLE. After over a decade helping to tell other artist's stories as an actor, making many independent films of all sizes and many dozens of television episodes, I'm finally ready to step behind the camera again and tell one of my own and I'm hoping you'll help me. </p>
<h3><strong>THE STORY</strong></h3>
<p>Cole is a military veteran recovering from a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) which has left him with a form of speech impairment called aphasia, specifically 'anomic aphasia'. While his mental faculties are fine, the speech center of his brain has been damaged, making it difficult for him to find the proper words or put them in the right order, especially in stressful situations. Now that he's out of the military and re-building his life in the civilian world he needs to find a job, a task made all the more stressful and uncertain by the disability he has to conquer.</p>
<p>Our film follows Cole and his wife Ashley as he spends the morning preparing for an interview, rehearsing what he wants to say and struggling to keep his aphasia under control when the moment of truth arrives.</p>
<p><strong>Why COLE?</strong></p>
<p>I chose this story because I wanted to make something simple and direct that also held special meaning for me. </p>
<p>As someone with close family and friends currently serving in the armed forces, these are issues I am very familiar with and care deeply about. My brother is an active duty combat veteran and this script came about after visiting him on post and talking with him and some other soldiers and vets. We discussed the difficulties they faced reentering the civilian world and how the all too common depiction of vets in film and television as unstable &amp; psychologically troubled or as unimpeachable heroes had led a widening of the gulf between them and their civilian counterparts, making it increasingly difficult for them to find jobs and re-integrate into American society. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>FUNDING &amp; BUDGET</strong></h3>
<div>
<p>Even though COLE is a short film, it's still a film and to make it with the quality and care it deserves will cost some money. Fortunately, I and my production team have a lot of experience making high-quality independent films with very limited resources, so you can trust that every dollar we raise will be accounted for and spent wisely.</p>
<p><strong>The budget for this 15-minute short film is $20,000.</strong></p>
<p>About 10% of that goes to IndieGoGo and PayPal/credit card processing.</p>
<p>The rest will be spent on payment to the cast and crew, and ""hard costs,"" of a 4-day shoot and post-production.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Cast and crew payments include actors, Production Department (producers &amp; production assistants), Camera Department (cinematographer, assistant cameramen, grips, electricians), sound mixer, script supervisor, production designer, editor, and post production supervision,</p>
<p>""Hard costs"" include craft service set food, prop purchases, meals for cast and crew, equipment rental, vehicle rental, production supplies, batteries, hard drives, film festival submission fees, and promotion.</p>
<p>If we are unable to reach our entire fund-raising goal here, there are two possibilities for the money. We will either see what we can eliminate from the production to make a smaller budget work, or we will hold the money in an account while other fund-raising efforts are made to achieve the target amount. In either case, the contributions will ONLY be used for the production of COLE.</p>
<p>In the event we raise more money than our goal, the funds will be used to pay the cast and crew more than just the bare minimum, get more and better equipment, have better options in post production, and have more effective means of promoting the film.</p>
<p><strong>PERKS</strong></p>
<p>We don't expect something for nothing and we've put together a great set of perks and rewards for our backers. We take our contributors seriously and want them to feel part of the production. That is why the perks are focused on credits on the film, behind the scenes photos and videos, scripts and cast &amp; crew screening invitations. </p>
<p><strong>All perks over the $35 price will have password access to the final cut of the film online.</strong></p>

<h3><u>From Our Producers... </u></h3>
<p><i>Marla Kate Fuller &amp; Mariel Kathryn Hunter</i></p>
<p>When ""The Belladonnas"" was first conceived a year ago, I thought it was a good way to draw attention to the taboo issues many homeless women and women in developing nations face concerning finding and affording menstrual products. At the time, I couldn't have predicted that access to women's health care would become so widely threatened for so many. Now, with the leader of the free world pushing such a blatantly regressive agenda in women’s healthcare, the need for a group like the Belladonnas is even more pressing. As an American myself, I believe it's never been more important to remain vigilant and informed. As the Belladonnas do, we also believe it’s incredibly important to stand up, be heard and make a difference.</p>
<p>We believe The Belladonnas will be successful in serving several purposes. Firstly, obviously, to create an entertaining and unique short film which will prove the potential for an entertaining and unique feature. Secondly, this is an amazing opportunity to work with a talented, kick-ass group of young filmmakers and we’ve created a far too rare chance to showcase what a predominantly female crew can create. Finally, and this is where we really need your help, we have a moment here in which we can raise awareness of what is happening. We can use this moment to foster a much needed dialogue around these issues, and hopefully we can build a lasting community capable of taking these themes (and this rebellion) off the screen and into the real world. </p>
<p>When you donate to the film, when you sport your Belladonna gear, or when you even simply share the campaign with friends, you help keep bring this conversation to life and your voice becomes one that cannot and will not be ignored. It’s then that you too become a Belladonna yourself. Welcome to the Belladonnas. Welcome to the rebellion. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><u>The Belladonna Breakdown</u></h3>
<p><i>Here's what we need your support for: </i></p>
<p><strong>Camera Equipment &amp; Rentals:</strong> <i>$1500</i> </p>
<p>We're lucky to have some hookups that'll give us great rates and even loan us some gear because they too believe in the Belladonna rebellion, but we could use your help to boost our production value and make this message one that cannot be ignored.</p>
<p><b>Production Design: </b><i>$1500  </i></p>
<p>We're telling you now- this film is going to look AMAZING. We could not be more excited about what we are already working with- but could it look so amazing that investors for the feature couldn't help but say ""<i>shut up and take my money!""</i></p>
<p>...ABSOLUTELY. </p>
<p>Your boost to our budget will allow us to truly create the world in which the Belladonnas are waging the good fight against the powers that be. We're eternally grateful for your help saving us from the future they are asking us to save them from. </p>
<p><b>Locations: </b><i>$1000 </i></p>
<p>The Belladonnas have a kick ass underground clubhouse- and we have the perfect place to shoot it! The only issue is that nothing comes from free- much less anything perfect. S0- if you could help us finance our dream Belladonna abode we would love you for forever! </p>
<p><b>Crafty &amp; Catering: </b><i>$800</i> </p>

</div></div>","From Our Producers... 
Marla Kate Fuller & Mariel Kathryn Hunter
When ""The Belladonnas"" was first conceived a year ago, I thought it was a good way to draw attention to the taboo issues many homeless women and women in developing nations face concerning finding and affording menstrual products. At the time, I couldn't have predicted that access to women's health care would become so widely threatened for so many. Now, with the leader of the free world pushing such a blatantly regressive agenda in women’s healthcare, the need for a group like the Belladonnas is even more pressing. As an American myself, I believe it's never been more important to remain vigilant and informed. As the Belladonnas do, we also believe it’s incredibly important to stand up, be heard and make a difference.
We believe The Belladonnas will be successful in serving several purposes. Firstly, obviously, to create an entertaining and unique short film which will prove the potential for an entertaining and unique feature. Secondly, this is an amazing opportunity to work with a talented, kick-ass group of young filmmakers and we’ve created a far too rare chance to showcase what a predominantly female crew can create. Finally, and this is where we really need your help, we have a moment here in which we can raise awareness of what is happening. We can use this moment to foster a much needed dialogue around these issues, and hopefully we can build a lasting community capable of taking these themes (and this rebellion) off the screen and into the real world. 
When you donate to the film, when you sport your Belladonna gear, or when you even simply share the campaign with friends, you help keep bring this conversation to life and your voice becomes one that cannot and will not be ignored. It’s then that you too become a Belladonna yourself. Welcome to the Belladonnas. Welcome to the rebellion. 
 

The Belladonna Breakdown
Here's what we need your support for: 
Camera Equipment & Rentals: $1500 
We're lucky to have some hookups that'll give us great rates and even loan us some gear because they too believe in the Belladonna rebellion, but we could use your help to boost our production value and make this message one that cannot be ignored.
Production Design: $1500  
We're telling you now- this film is going to look AMAZING. We could not be more excited about what we are already working with- but could it look so amazing that investors for the feature couldn't help but say ""shut up and take my money!""
...ABSOLUTELY. 
Your boost to our budget will allow us to truly create the world in which the Belladonnas are waging the good fight against the powers that be. We're eternally grateful for your help saving us from the future they are asking us to save them from. 
Locations: $1000 
The Belladonnas have a kick ass underground clubhouse- and we have the perfect place to shoot it! The only issue is that nothing comes from free- much less anything perfect. S0- if you could help us finance our dream Belladonna abode we would love you for forever! 
Crafty & Catering: $800 
Cast & Crew has gotta eat- a happy productive team is one with full bellies and as we cannot afford to pay everyone for this shoot the least we can do is be sure they are well provided for with plenty to nourish them as they work hard (and for free) on behalf of the rebellion. 
Sound: $150
We're fighting the rebellion to have our voices heard! So...it'd be good to have some decent sound on this production! We're calling in favours and we've got some pretty great folks on our side here at Belladonnas HQ who can help us out, but at the end of the day great sound is still gonna cost you a little cha-ching. Thanks for your help in making us heard around the world! 
Makeup & Hair: $250
Oh wow, do the Belladonnas have some great supporters and friends! We're having the pros come out in spades to help us as affordably as they can- and these magnificent creatures are going to run their department with only a budget for their kit fees. Please help us thank them by at least being able to cover their expenses for their efforts in the rebellion!

<h3>Storyline</h3>
<p>We are in a world where a certain division of man isn't born, but artificially created. We follow AL, a man who wakes with no knowledge of who or what he is. Imprisoned in a dream like room, his only connection to the outside world is a TV, which begins to inform his personality. He is presented with a set of characters and footage which teaches him to think, function and express himself, however, the room likes to play games with AL. It exposes him to progressively disturbing imagery and engages him in a series of debilitating challenges. AL must find a way to free his mind from the influence of the TV and escape the room.</p>
<h3>Characters</h3>
<p><i>AL, the man in the room -</i></p>
<p>    AL is the central character in our story, we see him grow and transform through his experiences in the room. Early in the story, he is in many ways like a child but as the story progresses, we see how life in the room manipulates his development. It becomes his goal to break free and define himself as an individual, as opposed to a collection of information presented through a TV.</p>
<p><i>In addition to footage of the world, landscapes, wildlife, cartoons, music and film, etc. There are a series of characters AL sees on TV which are detrimental to his growth and understanding of what a human is. The footage of these characters often resembles CCTV footage.</i></p>
<p><i>Hunter, 'The man on TV'</i></p>
<p>    Hunter is the first human AL sees on TV. He is a teacher of sorts. Through imitating him, AL learns many basic human functions and abilities, including eating, speaking, reading and writing. He often emphasises AL's need for a friend or a parent figure,</p>
<p><i>Rose, 'The Woman on TV'</i></p>
<p>    Rose is AL's introduction to love and infatuation. He is shown footage of her, often in private or intimate scenarios, that are designed to make AL grow romantically attached to her. Her presence emphasises AL's loneliness, his desire for a partner, and his need to love and feel loved. </p>
<p><i>Grey, 'The prisoner on TV'</i></p>
<p>    Grey is a man being driven mad. Trapped in a claustrophobic environment, he behaves like a caged animal, his situation often emphasising AL's own captivity, fear, and need to escape. Grey is the only character who looks into the CCTV camera. He often shows signs of awareness and rebellion against his captors.</p>
<p><i>'The singer on TV'</i></p>
<p>    The singer on TV is a 50s/60s R&amp;B pop star who appears occasionally throughout the film. She sings a song which seem as if it's be directly about AL, the lyrics of which often reflect his infatuation with Rose, his loneliness, and his need to escape. As the story progresses, the song transforms from a piece of catharsis, into a reflection of his entrapment, the validity of the lyrics often emphasises the likelihood that he is being watched.</p>
<h3>The Team</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488557121/iq2dso56unbnadfjp2bx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Our Challenge</h3>
<p>As many people working in the arts can attest to, one of the biggest problems when setting out to create an idea, is funding. However, this is a feature film that can be made for a few thousand pounds rather than several millions. Not only is it an idea that allows me to tell a story with I deeply believe in, but it's an idea that gives me the opportunity to break into the feature film industry without the massive funding restrictions that hold so many young creatives back.</p>
<p>The total contribution of £3500 allows me to achieve my dream of directing a feature film, with a story I love. It allows me the chance to make a name for myself in an industry otherwise limited for opportunities. And it allows me to give my filmmaking team the chance to succeed. I believe If this does well on the festival circuit, it could be the big break me and team are looking for.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>The £3500 (minus indiegogo's 5% cut) is to be split across 3 main sectors.</p>
<p><strong>1. £1000 for set dressing, props, and stock footage</strong></p>
<p>These items are quite specific, as they all need to fit within the artistic style. It includes -</p>
<p>A chair, bed, rugs, floor tiling, curtains, a mirror, several different paints, a TV, furniture, several lights and diffusers to be built within the set, a large framed painting of Caspar David Friedrich's 'the wanderer above the sea of fog', several decorative props, and props to be used by the character.</p>
<p>The stock footage is for some educational material to be displayed on the TV. While a lot of the TV footage will be filmed and made by myself, some of it, such as world war II footage and atomic bombs, can't feasibly be shot realistically with the limitations we have.</p>
<p><strong>2. £1000 for cast and crew expenses</strong></p>
<p>Everyone is working on this film voluntarily, but in order to do so, they need support. £1000 is to be spent on covering all the cast and crew expenses. This includes travel, food, and general hospitality for the cast and crew over the 15 day shoot period.</p>
<p><strong>3. £1325 is for video and audio gear</strong></p>
<p>In order to shoot the way desired, we require a series of video and audio gear. Rental was considered for a lot of this equipment, but as the shoot is over a long period of 15 days, it became more logical to buy most of the equipment, which can then later be resold and used to spend on marketing and entering into film festivals.</p>
<p>We will be purchasing</p>
<ul>
<li> Zhiyun 3-axis gimbal stabiliser for DSLR and BMPCC</li>
<li>14mm panasonic lens top be used with a black magic pocket cinema camera</li>
<li>A Rode NTG 4+</li>
<li>Zoom H4N SP</li>
<li>Cheap florescent lights, with stand, soft boxes, and green, black, and white screen</li>
<li>2 day Rental of Sony FS5 with accessories for high quality slow motion shots</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The last £175 is taken by indiegogo, as they require a 5% hosting fee.</strong></p>
<p>If we exceed our target, the surplus funds will go towards post production, marketing, film festival entries, and providing the cast and crew with pay. If you wish to keep contribute after the initial target, please feel free to do so.</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>To set this apart from many other crowdfunding campaigns, I think it's important that contributors really feel apart of the film in someway.</p>
<p>As a result anyone who donates £20 or more gets a special thanks in the end credits of the film. That's your name forever immortalised in a feature film. </p>
<p>Anyone who donates £30 or more, gets to make up their own credit. The idea behind the make your credit choice is that it allows a much more interactive contribution, each individual gets to imprint their personality in someway at the end of the credits.</p>
<p>There are many other perks, from props, to signed materials, and everyone who donates £10 or more gets a downloadable copy of the film.</p>
<p>The biggest perk however comes at £1000. This is a fully fledged producers credit (limited at two). This means that as one of the primary funders, your name will appear next to the directors on the DVD and all promotional material.</p>
<p>I designed these perks to reward those who really believe in the project.</p>

<p>Thanks for those of you who have contributed to this campaign.  But we are short of our goal.</p>
<p>When my life changed drastically three years ago, I questioned if it was because I hadn't been doing enough, being enough to my husband and family, or even being enough for God. I have heard many others are struggling in the same way, and I want to point them to Jesus - the enough for everything.</p>
<p>But I need your help to make that happen.  We lost a major funding source and now I am taking on that financial burden.</p>
<p>My goal is to raise $100,000 in the next 30 days. That sounds impossible, but I know you, my fans, and I serve a God that makes all things possible.</p>
<p>So if you feel led to contribute, you can do so on this page. But whether you can support this message financially or not, please come to the movie. And bring your girlfriends, your daughters or even your mother.  We will laugh, some might cry, but we can all rejoice together in a gathering of like-minded women celebrating that, through faith in Jesus, we are enough. </p>

He is sent by his brothers to remember what it was like to love Gods favourite creation, mankind. Mortemus wakes up in a hospital encounters humans, various angels and the devil himself all sharing their perspectives of life, the after life, and what it means to existence.
This campaign means the world to us because our crew has so many skills and talents that we want to showcase the best way possible. We have taken many many MANY production, design and acting classes in our University career, and now it is time to put our degree to good use! This is our first independent film project branching away from the in class assignments we hated conforming to. It's now time for us to take our first big step towards the professional film world.
 


Our goal is $2000. We want to bring you the best film possible, and unfortunately, film making costs money. We want to invest a lot in art direction. Art direction covers a lot of materials such as make-up, special effects, set design, costumes, etc. Outside of that, we want to put a lot of money into equipment rentals, paying actors/actresses, location rental fees, and food.
 


For those who donate to us, we have a wide variety of incentives available to you. That includes things such as: a digital download of the film, a special thanks in the credits, an Essence of Death t-shirt, a Private Screening to the film, or even an associate or executive producer credit!

<h3><strong>Synopsis</strong></h3>
<p>""American Boy"" is a short film with a giant story. Alex is only ten, so he knows squat about the hostile world he was born into. Mom's off working all day because she's a pay check away from eviction. Dad's locked up because he's a brown skinned man who fell into all the wrong traps. Alex's older brother, Juan, is on the same trajectory, too young to realize he's just another pawn for a trillion dollar drug cartel. </p>
<p>Our film takes place the day it all comes crashing down on Alex. The question is, will he get back up?</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Why support this campaign?</h3>
<p>1. We will endeavor to make a powerful film, to the highest cinematic standards.</p>
<p>2. This is a story that Hollywood avoids, perhaps because it's painful to think about children murdering other children. And we're not talking boy soldiers in Sudan or Somalia - but youngsters all over the US, who are also caught up in a war they didn't create. By providing real context, this film goes some way to honor those we've lost - and raise awareness about those we still need to protect.</p>
<p>3. Some children experience a reality more terrifying than fiction. They live in a constant state of fight or flight and suffer personal loss on the scale of any epic tragedy. Our film will show that world, unvarnished, through the eyes of an utterly innocent ten year old boy.</p>
<p>4. The idea is based on a thousand true stories and was inspired by interviews recorded by the writer/director while filming at-risk youth moving in and out of the criminal justice system. Every young offender was once a defenseless kid, and it's illuminating to revisit that moment of innocence in context. To imagine them before things went so terribly wrong. An audience can empathize if they better understand.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What Is Asked For &amp; What Will Be Returned</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>The goal is to raise $25,000.</p>
<p>No principal filmmakers will receive any funds. </p>
<p>All money raised will go to cast, crew, permits, production and post production, including a live recording of a children's choir to close out the film.</p>
<p>Because we focus on minors, we must comply with state permit rules for children in film, including on-set teachers and shorter work days. That increases budget.</p>
<p>Likewise we must comply with state permit rules for use of weapons, including official police presence on location, canvassing the neighborhood before filming etc. </p>

<h3><strong>Poverty and Homelessness statistics in Canada:</strong></h3>
<p><strong>1 in 7 (or 4.9 million) </strong>people in Canada live in poverty.</p>
<p><strong>21% of single mothers</strong> raise their children in Canada in poverty.</p>
<p><strong>1.3 million children</strong> in Canada live in poverty, that's 1 in 5.</p>
<p><strong>Niagara Falls is one of the most amazing cities in the world, right? Of course! And yet...</strong></p>
<p>In Niagara alone, the number of people helped by Project Share (Niagara Falls food bank) between 2008 and the end of of 2016 rose by a shocking 26.5%. In Niagara, 1682 households were forced to rely on emergency shelter last year.</p>
<p>Now we are making a movie to support the Niagara Falls food bank once again and spur even more action in communities across Ontario, Canada, North America, even the world!</p>
<p>Every day, our list of generous sponsors grows. We are counting on you to help us shine a spotlight on Niagara and on what can be accomplished when we all work together!</p>

<p>In 2009, ten Niagara Falls men came together to test their endurance, their patience, and maybe their own friendship.</p>
<p>Five muggy days later, they had raised $302,000 for Project SHARE, and made the phrase '10 Men in a Tent' part of the local lingo. It spawned a follow-up fundraiser with most of the same participants in 2010, and a female version called 12 Women Who Care in 2011 and 2012.</p>
<p>The original fundraiser was sparked by Niagara Falls businessman – and now regional councillor – Bob Gale, who pitched the concept of familiar faces gathered in a tent for five days and four nights on his property next to the Gales gas station on Montrose Road. He was joined by former Niagara Falls Review publisher Dave Martineau, councillor Jim Diodati (now mayor), Ice Dogs owner Bill Burke, radio personality Rob White, Ripley's Entertainment manager Tim Parker, then Winter Festival of Lights manager Dino Fazio, Dr. George Zimakas, and businessmen Brian Pellow and Kevin Grealy.</p>
<p>It was an enormous success. And now, nearly a decade later, it will live on as a movie.</p>
<p>Martineau enjoys part-time work as an actor these days. While on the set of the TV show Reign last summer, he started talking about 10 Men in a Tent with screenwriter and director Joseph Schur. The more Martineau talked, the more Schur's eyes lit up.</p>
<p>“He grabbed my arm and said 'This is a movie!'”</p>
<p>Both Schur and Martineau were intrigued by a fictional story based on the true events, which could shed light on poverty and the need for food banks across the country. Schur soon had a script ready, and Martineau gathered the original 10 Men earlier this year to share the news.</p>
<p>“I filled them in and said 'This is the path we're going to go down.' I don't want to speak for anybody...there was genuine excitement, but (also) 'Yes Dave, this sounds really cute, we'll see if it happens.'</p>
<p>“Even my initial reaction was like, 'Come on, this is crazy.'”</p>
<p>And yet, every step of the way, Martineau finds more support for the project. With a budget of $150,000, he believes an IndieGoGo campaign for $50,000 will get the cameras rolling. If all goes well, filming could begin this fall or next spring.</p>
<p>While there are elements of humour – there was no lack of funny stuff during the original 10 Men in a Tent – it will mostly be an inspirational story told from the viewpoint of Jeff Guarasci, Project SHARE's resource development coordinator in 2009 ( and now the city's community development coordinator).</p>
<p>“He was the guy that organized it all, showed up every morning, kept everything on track,” says Martineau. “It's good he's going to get the recognition he should have got eight years ago.”</p>
<p>Fazio remembers feeling uncertain how the event would go over in 2009. Would people respond to ten well-off guys sleeping in a tent to raise money?</p>
<p>“From the time we walked to the site from the Project SHARE office three kilometres away, on the hottest day of the summer, I hoped we could rally the community behind us,” he recalls. “Some thought the idea was weird or strange, but the community really latched on and saw the promise of what we were trying to do.</p>
<p>“It was a moving experience.”</p>
<p>White can remember being hot, hungry and sleepless, but is “honoured to be part of this event, and the legacy of it.”</p>
<p>Every day of the event, businesses, residents, sports teams, etc., would drop off food or money. For five days, the tent became a focal point in the city.</p>
<p>Martineau, who will be the film`s executive producer, says the event wasn’t meant to simulate homelessness, but provide a “tiny glimpse into what it’s like for a lot of people.”</p>
<p>He looks back on it as a triumph for the community, not just the 10 Men.</p>
<p>“When you're that close to it, you don't realize maybe what occurred,” he says. “Maybe we didn't understand the magnitude of it, and we're kind of starting to now.”</p>

  By John Law, Niagara Falls Review (Tuesday, July 4, 2017 4:19:30 EDT PM)
In 2009, ten Niagara Falls men came together to test their endurance, their patience, and maybe their own friendship.
Five muggy days later, they had raised $302,000 for Project SHARE, and made the phrase '10 Men in a Tent' part of the local lingo. It spawned a follow-up fundraiser with most of the same participants in 2010, and a female version called 12 Women Who Care in 2011 and 2012.
The original fundraiser was sparked by Niagara Falls businessman – and now regional councillor – Bob Gale, who pitched the concept of familiar faces gathered in a tent for five days and four nights on his property next to the Gales gas station on Montrose Road. He was joined by former Niagara Falls Review publisher Dave Martineau, councillor Jim Diodati (now mayor), Ice Dogs owner Bill Burke, radio personality Rob White, Ripley's Entertainment manager Tim Parker, then Winter Festival of Lights manager Dino Fazio, Dr. George Zimakas, and businessmen Brian Pellow and Kevin Grealy.
It was an enormous success. And now, nearly a decade later, it will live on as a movie.
Martineau enjoys part-time work as an actor these days. While on the set of the TV show Reign last summer, he started talking about 10 Men in a Tent with screenwriter and director Joseph Schur. The more Martineau talked, the more Schur's eyes lit up.
“He grabbed my arm and said 'This is a movie!'”
Both Schur and Martineau were intrigued by a fictional story based on the true events, which could shed light on poverty and the need for food banks across the country. Schur soon had a script ready, and Martineau gathered the original 10 Men earlier this year to share the news.
“I filled them in and said 'This is the path we're going to go down.' I don't want to speak for anybody...there was genuine excitement, but (also) 'Yes Dave, this sounds really cute, we'll see if it happens.'
“Even my initial reaction was like, 'Come on, this is crazy.'”
And yet, every step of the way, Martineau finds more support for the project. With a budget of $150,000, he believes an IndieGoGo campaign for $50,000 will get the cameras rolling. If all goes well, filming could begin this fall or next spring.
While there are elements of humour – there was no lack of funny stuff during the original 10 Men in a Tent – it will mostly be an inspirational story told from the viewpoint of Jeff Guarasci, Project SHARE's resource development coordinator in 2009 ( and now the city's community development coordinator).
“He was the guy that organized it all, showed up every morning, kept everything on track,” says Martineau. “It's good he's going to get the recognition he should have got eight years ago.”
Fazio remembers feeling uncertain how the event would go over in 2009. Would people respond to ten well-off guys sleeping in a tent to raise money?
“From the time we walked to the site from the Project SHARE office three kilometres away, on the hottest day of the summer, I hoped we could rally the community behind us,” he recalls. “Some thought the idea was weird or strange, but the community really latched on and saw the promise of what we were trying to do.

<h3>
<i><strong>“All Risk No Award: The Story of Stunts”</strong></i> is a feature length documentary that seeks to bring attention to the deep history and connection between films and stunts.</h3>
<p><strong>Action</strong> is so much a part of what we expect in a modern film, that it’s hard to imagine them without it. Top studios throw billions of dollars each year at the chance of being the next big summer blockbuster. If you look at the list of the top 100 grossing films of all time, which represent <i>over one hundred billion dollars </i>in revenue, every last one of them contain action.</p>
<p>Just recently, action icon Mad Max returned with Fury Road, one of the biggest, baddest, balls out action films in years. The film smashed box office records and was nominated for an Oscar as Best Film of the Year. Oscar night was a landslide; with Mad Max taking home Oscars for costume design, makeup and hair, production design, sound and film editing. It was a celebration of all of the hard work and craftsmanship that went into the spectacle that is a blockbuster movie, well almost all of it. Despite being seen in almost every sequence shown during that night, no one from the stunt department were given the time of day.  </p>
<p>As strange as it may seem, the men and women who actually put their lives on the line, the people going off the buildings and getting caught on fire, are <u><strong>not eligible for an Oscar</strong></u>. Even though the trailers for the films that they are celebrating are filled with the hard work and dedication from these heroes, and even though it is their sacrifice that is really generating those million dollar box offices, they get <i><strong>no award</strong></i>.  </p>
<p><i>So why does Hollywood treat the stunt community like their dirty little secret? And who are these insane people that would still do this for a living?  </i></p>
<p>By talking with stunt industry vets, actors, and directors about the essential role that stunts play in bringing movie magic to life, we hope to get a glimpse into the mavericks and renegades that make it happen.  </p>
<p>The film will feature <strong>Jack Gill </strong>(<i>Fast and Furious 5,6,7,8 and many other films and tv shows</i>), an industry giant who has been <i><strong>fighting for Oscar recognition for 25 years</strong></i>. He has bled, broken bones, and given his life to a business that he loves. But that business does not seem to love him back. Jack has led the charge since the 90’s to get the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to recognize the stunt department’s contribution in the grand illusion. He has recently helped to form a grassroots movement called <strong>#standUPforstunts</strong> that has begun staging protests to draw attention to their cause. He has gained the support of industry heavyweights like <strong>Spielberg, Scorsese, </strong>and<strong> Schwarzenegger</strong>. Countless celebrities have started posting pictures of themselves with their stunt doubles supporting the cause. And now that Mad Max almost won best picture, it is getting harder for them to keep saying no. <strong>Now</strong> truly is <i><strong>a time to take action</strong></i>.</p>
<p>We plan to follow Jack and his fellow stunt professionals as they attempt once again to convince the Academy to create a <strong><i>“BEST ACTION DESIGNER”</i></strong> category for Oscars. We will watch Jack and the #standUPforstunts movement as they connect with entertainment industry professionals, including members of the Academy, and make their way through the obstacle course of Hollywood red tape.</p>
<p>We also plan to follow the struggles of up and coming stunt players, showing the <strong><i>sacrifice, practice, passion, and bravery</i></strong> it takes to work in this highly competitive industry. From the brutal workouts and training to the struggles supporting themselves and their families in the sporadic world of filmmaking, we plan to get beyond the glamour and glitz of showbiz facades and show the true human cost of fulfilling the <strong><i>public’s insatiable appetite for more action</i></strong>. Like everyone involved in this business, these brave souls are the dreamers who give their lives for the hope of getting to be in the big show.</p>
<p>Movies aren’t just made by producers or directors, it takes teams of people that give everything to do something they love. The time has come to recognize the amazing work of the dreamers, rebels, and daredevils who risk their lives so we can believe, if only for a brief moment, that maybe <i><strong>a person really can fly</strong></i>.  </p>
<p>We hope the film will be watched widely and broadly for both the narrative of, Jack Gill, a blockbuster movie stunt professional looking for Oscar recognition for his craft, and also for the action packed physicality of stunt work being planned and the finished product coming to life on screen. Additionally we see the film being screened in universities and in film schools across the US and abroad as Jack continues to struggle with the Academy for a stunt Oscar category.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520564423/ay6cyahnnuddfckmhnsi.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The film would seek to explore these five main character themes.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;""><strong><u>The Activist</u></strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">This character, Jack Gill, is our introduction into this world.  He is a legend of stunt craft and he has, for the past 25 years led his long standing battle against the Academy and their status quo.  We learn through him the setup, the history of stunts and his opinion on why the Oscars won’t recognize them.  We follow him to petition the Academy again and stage a protest to gain support.    </p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;""><u><strong>The Young and Hungry</strong></u></p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">We will explore what it takes to be a newcomer to this difficult to enter circle of professionals.  We will follow this character through their daily routine featuring their training; exercise, rituals, auditions, and rejections while they wait for their shot. What does it take to be in stunts?</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;""><strong><u>The Working Stunt Player</u></strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">We will explore the dues paid and injuries sustained to get to be in the big show.  We will hear the stories of their treatment on sets ranging from glowing to furious.  From stars lying about their contribution to films, to the Academy's refusal to recognize their craft in the Oscar ceremony, we will explore the misconceptions and truths behind one of the crafts most dangerous areas of work.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;""><strong><u>The Sad Stories</u></strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">This character or characters would explore the reality of the business, not everyone can live that dream.  We would try and find stories of those whose dreams, whether unrealistic or unfairly realized, just haven’t turned out.  When do you say enough?</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;""><strong><u>The Veterans</u></strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">These characters would help us explore the discarded legends of the unseen stunt players. These stories would show the impact of what living life at full throttle has on a person's psychical and emotional landscape. These people’s lives are scarred with divorce, alcoholism, and unfulfilled expectations. Has the ride been worth it?</p>
<p><u><strong>The Supporting Cast</strong> </u>will be made up of famous actors, producers, and members of other categories that do get Oscars, as we explore the lunacy of not including stunts contribution to the industry.  And most of all, these characters can lend tales of bravery and respect to the dialogue and show that stunt work deserves recognition. </p>
<p>And finally we wish to explore the pending extinction of the stunt department at the hands of the CG wizards of Marin County.  More and more stunt players are losing work to productions that choose their less realistic, safer, and increasingly more cost friendly avatars in the computer-generated worlds.  Soon this kind of bravado and bravery could very well be a thing of the past.  </p>
<p>But, much like the rise of CG effects that has marred and muddied the cinema landscape, we will find our films missing something in their absence.  They will be missing the human spirit that made this era of cinema so great. Computers can never top watching <i>Zoe Bell hanging from the front of a 1970 Dodge Challenger in Tarantino's Death Proof</i>. Stunt work like that will trump anything the CG wizards of Hollywood can cook up.   </p>
<h3>Now more than ever, it is <strong><i>time to take ACTION</i></strong>. It’s time to give these amazing talents a place in the Oscars.</h3>
<p> </p>

<p>We have a few different funding goals. Our starting goal is <u><i>$150,000</i></u>. The money will go to travel, legal fees, insurance, music rights, post sound, post color, IndieGoGo fees, perk costs, and of course a little pay for our sweat equity. </p>
<p>Our 2nd goal would be <u><i>$250,000</i></u>. This would allow us to travel to another interview or two, get rights to more music for the film, and also afford us to be able to hire a couple specialty crew members (sound, camera).</p>
<p>Our 3<sup>rd</sup> and ultimate goal is <u><i>$650,000</i></u>. This is what it would take to cover all of the IndieGoGo fees and Perk costs to hit our dream budget of <u><i>$500,000</i></u>. At this budget we’d be able to travel to more of our interviewees (most of them live in LA, but are rarely here because the films they work on are shot outside of California). We would also be able to afford to work on this film full time for at least a year. The two previous goals would only cover enough for us to work part time, thus taking a lot longer to make the film. We want to spend all of our time on this to make the best film possible in the fastest time frame that we can.</p>
<p>As with all crowdfunding campaigns, the more we can raise, the more we can put into production.</p>
<p>Our goal is to shoot and edit in time for a big festival push for the 2019 festival season starting in January 2019. <strong>We want this film to be making some noise around Oscar season in February of 2019 as well.</strong></p>

<p>Upon completion, we hope to hold our world premiere at one of the major festivals in North America or Europe.</p>
<p>After a robust festival run, we envision the film having some limited theatrical release, but more likely finding a distribution home with one of the major doc broadcasters (HBO, Showtime, Netflix Worldwide, Hulu, CNN Films, POV or IL) in addition to international distribution with broadcasters like Arte, NDF, etc.</p>
<p>Our previous film <strong><i>“Prescription Thugs”</i></strong> premiered at the <i><u>2015 Tribeca Film Festival</u></i> and was acquired by Samuel Goldwyn Films. We hope for a similar release plan for <strong><i>“All Risk No Award: The Story of Stunts”.</i></strong></p>

<p><strong><i>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</i></strong></p>
<p>The biggest challenge is distribution – ""All Risk No Award: The Story of Stunts"" does not have a distributor attached yet. We producers are truly doing this all ourselves. Lack of distribution can also be a blessing. Making this film without a distributor or financier can allow us to make it without them demanding we adapt the film to fit their needs.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<p><i>THE FINE PRINT</i> (legal stuff) </p>
<ul>
<li>You must be over 18 or accompanied by a parent or legal guardian (who will count as your plus one) to attend the LA Advance Screening.</li>
<li>Our final cut of the film may have to be further edited in certain cases to adhere to the laws in the country which it is being viewed, or for different types of media.</li>
<li>All shooting locations are subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the amount of money we are able to raise and the particular locations giving us the right to shoot.</li>
<li>This fundraising campaign is all subject to applicable IndieGoGo rules/regulations, movie guild rules and applicable law. If any of this conflicts, we will work with you in good faith to give you a substitute reward.</li>
<li>Any Producer credit perks don't include ownership rights or potential profit sharing of any kind. </li>
</ul>
<p>To sum it up, movie making is an insane business, with a lot of unknown factors. We start with a great idea. Then, we assemble the best team possible, get insurance, and make contingency plans. It's impossible to guarantee everything will come together exactly as planned, but in the end, we will have created a movie that hopefully all of us can be proud of. It's a great journey, and I thank you in advance if you can help make this ride possible.</p>
<p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>
<p><strong>When will the movie be made?</strong></p>
<p>We've already started filming! If you guys help us make the funding goal, we will be able to finish it much faster so you can see it sooner.</p>
<p><strong>When will the movie be released?</strong></p>
<p>Since we don’t have distribution, we don’t have a release date locked down. There are a lot of factors that whoever distributes our film will take into account when picking a date.  We would like to make a big film festival push starting in January 2019 (Sundance Film Festival). We hope to find a distributor there or soon after and release the film in a theater near you.</p>
<p><strong>When will the rewards be available?</strong></p>
<p>The physical items, like t-shirts should come pretty quickly. Once the campaign ends we will start working with our fulfillment center to process your perk rewards.</p>
<p><strong>If the project doesn’t fund, do I get my money back?</strong></p>
<p>Straight answer, no.  We chose to do the Flex funding here on IndieGoGo.  If we fail to hit our goal, depending on the amount of money we do raise, we will chose to either try and make the film on a lower budget, or use the funds as leverage to secure an investor for the remainder of the budget.  Either way, we promise to make you an excellent film that you as backers will be proud of and you will still receive your reward perks. </p>
<p><strong>Where does my money go?</strong></p>
<p>All of your pledges will be collected and deposited into a bank account that my producers and I have set up for the sole purpose of funding the film.</p>
<p><strong>What do you do if you exceed your goal?</strong></p>
<p>Exceed our goal?  It would be amazing to even hit our goal much less exceed it.  If we are to exceed our goal (very wishful thinking) we will add the funds to the film’s budget where we feel it could use a little more. This may afford us the possibility of getting much nicer gear for shooting, book better locations, have awesome music in the film, etc..</p>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","“All Risk No Award: The Story of Stunts” is a feature length documentary that seeks to bring attention to the deep history and connection between films and stunts.
Action is so much a part of what we expect in a modern film, that it’s hard to imagine them without it. Top studios throw billions of dollars each year at the chance of being the next big summer blockbuster. If you look at the list of the top 100 grossing films of all time, which represent over one hundred billion dollars in revenue, every last one of them contain action.
Just recently, action icon Mad Max returned with Fury Road, one of the biggest, baddest, balls out action films in years. The film smashed box office records and was nominated for an Oscar as Best Film of the Year. Oscar night was a landslide; with Mad Max taking home Oscars for costume design, makeup and hair, production design, sound and film editing. It was a celebration of all of the hard work and craftsmanship that went into the spectacle that is a blockbuster movie, well almost all of it. Despite being seen in almost every sequence shown during that night, no one from the stunt department were given the time of day.  
As strange as it may seem, the men and women who actually put their lives on the line, the people going off the buildings and getting caught on fire, are not eligible for an Oscar. Even though the trailers for the films that they are celebrating are filled with the hard work and dedication from these heroes, and even though it is their sacrifice that is really generating those million dollar box offices, they get no award.  
So why does Hollywood treat the stunt community like their dirty little secret? And who are these insane people that would still do this for a living?  
By talking with stunt industry vets, actors, and directors about the essential role that stunts play in bringing movie magic to life, we hope to get a glimpse into the mavericks and renegades that make it happen.  
The film will feature Jack Gill (Fast and Furious 5,6,7,8 and many other films and tv shows), an industry giant who has been fighting for Oscar recognition for 25 years. He has bled, broken bones, and given his life to a business that he loves. But that business does not seem to love him back. Jack has led the charge since the 90’s to get the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to recognize the stunt department’s contribution in the grand illusion. He has recently helped to form a grassroots movement called #standUPforstunts that has begun staging protests to draw attention to their cause. He has gained the support of industry heavyweights like Spielberg, Scorsese, and Schwarzenegger. Countless celebrities have started posting pictures of themselves with their stunt doubles supporting the cause. And now that Mad Max almost won best picture, it is getting harder for them to keep saying no. Now truly is a time to take action.
We plan to follow Jack and his fellow stunt professionals as they attempt once again to convince the Academy to create a “BEST ACTION DESIGNER” category for Oscars. We will watch Jack and the #standUPforstunts movement as they connect with entertainment industry professionals, including members of the Academy, and make their way through the obstacle course of Hollywood red tape.
We also plan to follow the struggles of up and coming stunt players, showing the sacrifice, practice, passion, and bravery it takes to work in this highly competitive industry. From the brutal workouts and training to the struggles supporting themselves and their families in the sporadic world of filmmaking, we plan to get beyond the glamour and glitz of showbiz facades and show the true human cost of fulfilling the public’s insatiable appetite for more action. Like everyone involved in this business, these brave souls are the dreamers who give their lives for the hope of getting to be in the big show.
Movies aren’t just made by producers or directors, it takes teams of people that give everything to do something they love. The time has come to recognize the amazing work of the dreamers, rebels, and daredevils who risk their lives so we can believe, if only for a brief moment, that maybe a person really can fly.  
We hope the film will be watched widely and broadly for both the narrative of, Jack Gill, a blockbuster movie stunt professional looking for Oscar recognition for his craft, and also for the action packed physicality of stunt work being planned and the finished product coming to life on screen. Additionally we see the film being screened in universities and in film schools across the US and abroad as Jack continues to struggle with the Academy for a stunt Oscar category.

The film would seek to explore these five main character themes.
The Activist
This character, Jack Gill, is our introduction into this world.  He is a legend of stunt craft and he has, for the past 25 years led his long standing battle against the Academy and their status quo.  We learn through him the setup, the history of stunts and his opinion on why the Oscars won’t recognize them.  We follow him to petition the Academy again and stage a protest to gain support.    
The Young and Hungry
We will explore what it takes to be a newcomer to this difficult to enter circle of professionals.  We will follow this character through their daily routine featuring their training; exercise, rituals, auditions, and rejections while they wait for their shot. What does it take to be in stunts?
The Working Stunt Player
We will explore the dues paid and injuries sustained to get to be in the big show.  We will hear the stories of their treatment on sets ranging from glowing to furious.  From stars lying about their contribution to films, to the Academy's refusal to recognize their craft in the Oscar ceremony, we will explore the misconceptions and truths behind one of the crafts most dangerous areas of work.
The Sad Stories
This character or characters would explore the reality of the business, not everyone can live that dream.  We would try and find stories of those whose dreams, whether unrealistic or unfairly realized, just haven’t turned out.  When do you say enough?
The Veterans
These characters would help us explore the discarded legends of the unseen stunt players. These stories would show the impact of what living life at full throttle has on a person's psychical and emotional landscape. These people’s lives are scarred with divorce, alcoholism, and unfulfilled expectations. Has the ride been worth it?
The Supporting Cast will be made up of famous actors, producers, and members of other categories that do get Oscars, as we explore the lunacy of not including stunts contribution to the industry.  And most of all, these characters can lend tales of bravery and respect to the dialogue and show that stunt work deserves recognition. 
And finally we wish to explore the pending extinction of the stunt department at the hands of the CG wizards of Marin County.  More and more stunt players are losing work to productions that choose their less realistic, safer, and increasingly more cost friendly avatars in the computer-generated worlds.  Soon this kind of bravado and bravery could very well be a thing of the past.  
But, much like the rise of CG effects that has marred and muddied the cinema landscape, we will find our films missing something in their absence.  They will be missing the human spirit that made this era of cinema so great. Computers can never top watching Zoe Bell hanging from the front of a 1970 Dodge Challenger in Tarantino's Death Proof. Stunt work like that will trump anything the CG wizards of Hollywood can cook up.   
Now more than ever, it is time to take ACTION. It’s time to give these amazing talents a place in the Oscars.
 

We have already begun filming and reaching out to some of the top talent in the entertainment industry to be a part of this documentary. A lot of the top stunt performers and coordinators have already signed on to the project. Here are just a few that have already agreed to be a part of this documentary.

What you really get, other than the cool perks you pick, is to be a part of something bigger! 

You'll be a part of a MOVEMENT TO CHANGE THE ACADEMY AWARDS.
We're not saying our documentary will make this change, but it will be a huge stepping stone for all of the professionals in the industry and everyone else that believes that the change needs to happen. 
 

We have a few different funding goals. Our starting goal is $150,000. The money will go to travel, legal fees, insurance, music rights, post sound, post color, IndieGoGo fees, perk costs, and of course a little pay for our sweat equity. 
Our 2nd goal would be $250,000. This would allow us to travel to another interview or two, get rights to more music for the film, and also afford us to be able to hire a couple specialty crew members (sound, camera).
Our 3rd and ultimate goal is $650,000. This is what it would take to cover all of the IndieGoGo fees and Perk costs to hit our dream budget of $500,000. At this budget we’d be able to travel to more of our interviewees (most of them live in LA, but are rarely here because the films they work on are shot outside of California). We would also be able to afford to work on this film full time for at least a year. The two previous goals would only cover enough for us to work part time, thus taking a lot longer to make the film. We want to spend all of our time on this to make the best film possible in the fastest time frame that we can.
As with all crowdfunding campaigns, the more we can raise, the more we can put into production.
Our goal is to shoot and edit in time for a big festival push for the 2019 festival season starting in January 2019. We want this film to be making some noise around Oscar season in February of 2019 as well.

American ingenuity is again at the forefront of a return to the appreciation of craft and a rejection of the mass-produced, disposable object. In addition, the current farm-to-table movement has revolutionized the restaurant industry, but these same principles were utilized by Stickley when he operated the restaurant in his Manhattan building with product from his farm in New Jersey, 100 years prior. Stickley was a visionary, and an advocate for values and ideals that were long ahead of their time.What We Need:We need $40,000 to go toward post production work. The funds raised will go 100% towards the cost of post production including editing, image rights, etc....  We anticipate completing the editing of the film in 2018 for release.What Happens if Our Goal is Not Reached:We will continue to work on the film as funds become available. If we are not able to fully fund this campaign, we will be exploring other funding mechanisms such as grants . We have had great support from the Arts & Crafts community, as well as the Stickley family, and hope that you will want to be included in the list of supporters wanting to see this story on film.  Impact of your contribution:We hope to debut the finished film in 2018, which will be the 160th anniversary of Stickley’s birth. Our image rights and editing process will take the next 6-9 months to complete. We are deeply committed to telling this story on film, and will do so thanks to the support of the incredibly passionate arts and crafts community and other generous supporters. We Want Your Help!We hope that you will be able to assist the project with a cash contribution, but if you are unable to there is another way to support the project, you can help spread the word to anyone you know who would be interested in our film. Gustav Stickley’s story is a true American tale of success; a first generation immigrant who followed his passion and created a unique set of ideals that envisioned a greater lifestyle, that in harmony with nature that appreciated the value and beauty of handmade items. He was a visionary who created and promoted an entire way of life and envisioned trends, that we are still enjoying today",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

Stephan, is consumed by perfectionism in the world of music competitions and facing different expectations from his family.

This awakens his full sensory abilities and intuitive intelligence of heart in the pursuit of his music.</p><p align=""left""> </p><h3 align=""left""><u><strong>WHY IS STORY IMPORTANT:</strong></u></h3><p>The story is relevant to us because it deals with the issues of the dichotomy between seeing the pursuit of music as a means to material and tangible gains and as a process of reinvigorating our inner being and untangling the mystery of our internal universe. It also investigates the concept of Asian philosophies including mind-body centering and its impact on our visions of the pursuit of happiness and the measurement of success.</p><p>Touching the Sound explores the concept of mind-body centering through the eyes of a competitive classical pianist and his subconscious. The methodology of mind-body centering is highly influenced by the synthesis of Eastern Philosophy and theories from Western frameworks, it is an integrated methodology that uses hands-on repatterning and movement re-education; based on physiological, anatomical, developmental, and psychophysical principles. The audience gets a glimpse of this through the non-linear and fragmented storytelling style which delve into the main character’s subconscious and memories.</p><p>Touching the Sound is a compelling art film because it delves into exploring the inter-disciplinary dialogue between narrative, live classical music and contemporary dance in the cinematic art framework.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Comes <i>The Guardian</i>...</h3>
<p>Through the eyes of GUARDIAN JACOBSON, this dramatic short film evokes the tensions we face as a people struggling to weigh the skyrocketing communal costs of health insurance against the value of individual freedom of choice and life itself.</p>
<p>In Jacobson’s world as an agent of Lifewatch Life &amp; Health, the cost of ensuring the safety and health of covered individuals is near compulsory submission to the coldly calculating efficiencies of the “Controllers,” nameless and faceless actuaries with the power to decide life and death on the basis of cost / benefit analysis.</p>
<p>As a Guardian, it’s usually Jacobson’s job to keep insured people on track and administer warnings when they aren’t compliant with their company's Health Improvement Plan. But these days, Jacobson has taken on high paying “bonus work” in order to fund his son’s college education. In return for this extra pay, Jacobson must impose the harshest penalty an insured can endure…repossession of the insured's Biometric Neurotactic Device Implant (BNDI). Already soul-weary from his years as a Guardian, Jacobson is suddenly faced with a crisis that will force him to either relinquish everything he’s lived for or shed his last bits of his humanity.</p>
<p>What's a father to do?</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Lifewatch Life &amp; Health Wants You!</strong></h3>

Comes The Guardian...
Through the eyes of GUARDIAN JACOBSON, this dramatic short film evokes the tensions we face as a people struggling to weigh the skyrocketing communal costs of health insurance against the value of individual freedom of choice and life itself.
In Jacobson’s world as an agent of Lifewatch Life & Health, the cost of ensuring the safety and health of covered individuals is near compulsory submission to the coldly calculating efficiencies of the “Controllers,” nameless and faceless actuaries with the power to decide life and death on the basis of cost / benefit analysis.
As a Guardian, it’s usually Jacobson’s job to keep insured people on track and administer warnings when they aren’t compliant with their company's Health Improvement Plan. But these days, Jacobson has taken on high paying “bonus work” in order to fund his son’s college education. In return for this extra pay, Jacobson must impose the harshest penalty an insured can endure…repossession of the insured's Biometric Neurotactic Device Implant (BNDI). Already soul-weary from his years as a Guardian, Jacobson is suddenly faced with a crisis that will force him to either relinquish everything he’s lived for or shed his last bits of his humanity.
What's a father to do?

I grew up reading Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Gabriel a Mistral, Pablo Neruda, Emily Dickinson, Paul Eluard and Maya Angelou. Poetry was part of my world and my imagination. This passion was an escape from the reality of my country Colombia that was in a constant civil war.In my twenties, I had to live in Chile and often listened to the stories of my friends about the dictatorships and all that their families had to suffer. This touched my heart so much that I could never forget. I felt that I had to express all those emotions, experiences, and part of my memories in a film.I want to tell a story that gives hope to people that are in all kinds of difficult situations.I first wrote this story in 2009 after completing a writing class in New York City and have been developing it into a script since then. In 2015, after returning from Cannes Court Metrage where I showed a short film Pink Dolphin, I decided then to create a feature film with this script even though everyone around me said it was too difficult. I started shooting the film in November of 2015 and half of the shooting is complete.  And now I am here on IndieGoGo to invite you to help finish this film and to tell this wonderful story to the world.This film is being produced independently by YV Film Production that I created with my husband Joshua R Hathaway. We were able to borrow some funds for half of the film that is complete. But because making a feature film is very expensive, we are here to invite you to be part of this film.  Every dollar raised by this campaign is going directly towards the budget of the film. ODE TO PAZ has been in development since 2015. We need the money that we’re asking for to finish this film and distribute to festivals and theatres. 100% of the money raised by this campaign will go towards making this film the best film it can possibly be. Oda A Paz: EspañolDesde los 12 años amé la poesía, y desde ese entonces comencé a escribir canciones y poemas. Crecí leyendo a  Gabriel García Márquez, Gabriela Mistral, Pablo Neruda, Emily Dickinson, Paul Eluard y Maya Angelou. La poesía fué parte de mi mundo y mi imaginación.

THE LAST IN LINE is about passion. Passion for film. Passion for role-playing games. Passion for creativity. We set out to create something that is original, entertaining and gripping. If you love a good story, we think you'll be excited to help this film on the final leg of its journey to the premiere, tentatively scheduled for late September of 2018. 

Bombshell Studios has created dozens of short films, music videos, corporate tie-ins, industrial tutorials and promos and web-series over the last fifteen years.
Our first feature represents the culmination of all we've learned, the beneficiary of our intense commitment to preparation.
We have spent three-years developing a beautiful, moving tribute to friendship and honor. Until now it’s been entirely self-funded because we wanted to be sure we could bring to life something our backers could be proud to have their names attached. For even more information about the film and to see highlights from these phases you can visit our website at 40kilo.bombshellstudios.com.
With this final last step to go, post-production, your contribution would be instrumental in the completion of this remarkable journey.

We've been given more time! Our new deadline is April 16th! We hope to get as close as we can to our $1 million campaign goal but do not fear we can still buy the property raising funds through investors. Failure is NOT an option! WE CAN DO THIS!   The Rio Theatre needs your help! Recent zoning changes have attracted the attention of developers who want to buy The Rio and tear it down for a new development project that would leave a big cavernous hole on the corner of Commercial and Broadway for years, and there is only one way to stop them: We have to buy The Rio!To do that, we need to raise a $3 million down payment: we hope to do that with $1 million from donors like you, plus $2 million from private investors.We can do this! The Rio has overcome adversity before with the huge support of the community. Our accepted offer to purchase the property was supported by over 22,000 signatures collected in just five days.The Rio Theatre is one of the last remaining indie theatres in Vancouver. With the community’s support to change the liquor laws in 2012 The Rio is now an award winning, successful business, a live performance venue/single-screen cinema that is thriving and leading the way as a model for other independent theatres to succeed.The Rio is located at Commercial and Broadway which is a central transit station in the heart of East Vancouver. Recent zoning changes led the property owners of the historical art-deco cinema to put it up for sale. To stop developers from giving it the same fate as other beloved cultural institutions in the city, we need to take action!We now have until midnight on April 16th to raise the funds for the down payment, so that we can secure a mortgage and finalize the purchase of the property.Yes! The Rio is no stranger to overcoming adversity, and East Van is not afraid of a fight. In 2012, with a groundswell of sustained community support, we won a very public battle with the LCLB to change the liquor laws to allow movie theatres to serve alcohol. Our victory in this public battle led to modernization of outdated liquor laws for the entire province of B.C.In January 2013, Corinne Lea, owner operator of the Rio Theatre business, who led the battle to change the BC liquor laws, received the Diamond Jubilee Governor General's Award from the Queen. Failure is not an option. Although the Rio holds a lease for the next three years, with an option to renew, failure to purchase the building will put The Rio in the hands of developers, leaving our future uncertain.We need to raise a $3 million down payment. We hope to do this with $1 million from donors like you through this crowdfunding campaign — if most of the 22,000 people who signed the petition gave just $100 each, we would easily meet and exceed our goal. We are looking to raise another $2 million from private investors. In addition, Corinne Lea, owner operator of The Rio business, will be taking on the mortgage and is investing her own personal funds to help make this happen.100% of your donation will go toward buying the property, 25% will go directly to The Rio business (Shameless Lee Productions Ltd.) to cover the costs of the purchase and the costs of this campaign. The other 75% will be donated to, The Vancouver Art House Society, a registered non-profit B.C. Society that will invest the donated funds to purchase the property and become an equity shareholder of the real estate. Run by a board of industry professionals, this society was created to ensure that funds raised by your donation will not only help save the Rio but it will continue on as a legacy project to help other Vancouver arts and culture organizations in the future. If you want 100% of your donation to go directly to the Art House Society there is an option you can choose in the list of perks. All funds donated to the non-profit Society will go towards purchasing shares of the property. The non-profit Society and the private investors are all shareholders of the property, they will not be involved with the daily operations running the theatre, instead they will become the new property owners!     The Vancouver Art House Society A registered non-profit B.C. Society with a mandate to help save Arts and Culture spaces in Vancouver. Run by a board of industry professionals, this Society was created to ensure that funds raised by your donation will not only help save the Rio, but it will continue on as a legacy project to help other Vancouver arts and culture organizations in the future. https://www.facebook.com/VanArtHouseSociety/Board Members: (We are currently in the process of building a dynamic team of local board members but here's the founding crew)Corinne Lea :  The Founder, CEO of The Rio Theatre. Corinne is an artist, entrepreneur and producer who has founded several successful, arts and cultural businesses in Vancouver such as: Flux Studios, Havana Restaurant Gallery & Theatre, Scout Boutique & Gallery and since 2008 she has owned and operated The Rio Theatre as Shameless Lee Productions, adding Xcalibur Film Productions in 2014 to the list.  In January 2012 Corinne Lea became well known for her very public battle, waged against The Liquor Control and Licensing Branch, in an effort to change the BC liquor laws that prevented movie theatres from obtaining a liquor license. In April 2012 the battle was successful and they managed to get the BC Government Liquor laws changed for the entire Province which enabled movie theatres to serve alcohol. This was a major win for Independent theatres throughout B.C. In January 2013 Corinne Lea received the Diamond Jubilee Governor Generals Award from the Queen. Essentially, she was awarded a medal from the government for fighting the government! She has over twenty years experience producing and promoting live multi-media shows and events. Working directly with distributors in the Film Industry, she heads a team of programmers who are responsible for The Rio Theatre’s diverse and award winning programming. She has two degrees: a BFA from Emily Carr Institute and a BA of Education from Simon Fraser University.David Duprey:  Is passionate about offering Vancouverites eclectic spaces, places for food and drink, dance, art and music rife with character and history.  His businesses encourage people to unshackle themselves and let their creativity run wild. All of our projects are a little left of centre. David Duprey believes that remarkable things happen when creative-minded people join forces to forge new-fangled artistic paths. With four live music venues, five art galleries, two restaurants, one bar/lounge, a music festival and an abundance of affordable studio space for hundreds of working artists now under our belt, his journey is just beginning. Raised in Vancouver David loves the way this city continues to evolve and grow. It is our mission to give agency to this grassroots artistic movement in Vancouver. We take pride in maintaining the architectural integrity of this city through refurbishment and reinvention. http://randdinc.ca/past.htmlMichael Wiebe:  Vancouver Park Board Commissioner , Owner of eight 1/2 restaurant lounge, MPBIA Co-president, Portside Pub Corporate Food Manager, & passionate Vancouverite. Commissioner Wiebe grew up skating on Jericho Pond, swimming at English Bay, and cycling in Stanley Park. He’s now a local business owner and community leader who wants to enhance Vancouver’s parks and facilities. Commissioner Wiebe mapped out the wheelchair accessibility of all trails in Stanley Park when he was only 12 years old and later co-founded the Vancouver Lifeguard Association. With a degree in business administration, he worked for the provincial government before opening his own restaurant, Eight 1/2, based on sustainable principles, including zero waste. Commissioner Wiebe is a director of the Mount Pleasant Business Improvement Area and a leader in zero waste, and has spoken internationally. A resident of Mount Pleasant, Commissioner Wiebe wants to help ensure that the right decisions are being made for Vancouver’s parks, guided by evidence-based policy and the principles of sustainability. He is also very passionate about saving arts and culture venues in Vancouver.News update The Hollywood Arts Foundation joins force with The Vancouver Art House Society to offer tax receipts for larger donations!It turns out, The Hollywood Arts Foundation also shares our goal, to help save Arts and culture venues in Vancouver. So we have decided to join forces! Not only will we be stronger together but the other major benefit this merge can offer is a tax receipt for all donations made to the Charitable Foundation and in return The Hollywood Arts Foundation will also become a shareholder in the property just like the, The Vancouver Art House Society.   The Hollywood Arts Foundation was created in 2016 by members of the Save the Hollywood Theatre Coalition in order to save arts and cultural venues in Vancouver. The loss of theatres, movie houses, bookstores, music institutions and other cultural businesses has accelerated in the last decade, under the pressure of real estate development. We feel that culture is an invaluable resource for a positive future in our city. It is the element through which we can better understand each other, how we can live together and make our city our home. The Hollywood Arts Foundation is dedicated to helping arts and cultural organizations and venues to thrive in Vancouver.hollywoodartsfoundation@gmail.comwww.facebook.com/VancouverHollywoodFoundation/ 1. DONATE. Choose a perk, or donate any amount by clicking the ""Back It"" button with the amount you wish to contribute. New perks will be added throughout the campaign! Plus EVERYONE who donates (unless you wish to remain anonymous) will get their name on our,      ""I Saved The Rio"", wall of fame that will be played on our big screen during our pre-show reel!Included in our perks is a special, I Saved The Rio Membership, card that not only gives you perks at the Rio but it also gives you discounts at local restaurants before or after the show such as Storm Crow, Chambar, JamJar, Bandidas, Eight & 1/2, Commercial Street Cafe and the list is growing everyday! 2. INVEST. Those who wish to invest  $25,000 or more can become equity shareholders in The Rio property as long as you qualify as a friend, family, or an accredited investor. To choose this option, contact Corinne Lea directly for more information at corinne@riotheatre.ca 3. SPREAD THE WORD. Even if you are unable to donate or invest, you can help by sharing this campaign on social media and through personal contacts.4. COME TO OUR EVENTS. We are planning a few awesome fundraising events that we will announce soon! To see our full schedule, visit www.riotheatre.ca Saving The Rio is not only important to me – it’s important to the culture of Vancouver and all the indie filmmakers and live performers who share their art with the community. The Rio Theatre is “an experience you can’t download” – that we share together and these communal experiences make all our lives richer. We cannot lose this important cultural landmark!  Thank you,  Corinne Lea https://globalnews.ca/news/4010500/director-kev...https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-co...What if we don't raise the money by the deadline? We are confident we can raise the money we need by April 16, 2018. But if we do not reach our $1 million goal from crowdfunding, we can still  raise the funds through investors and buy the property! That is why we have set this as a flexible goal. However if we are not able to purchase the property, all donated funds raised will be returned and The Rio Theatre business will continue to operate for the remainder of our lease. Can I donate a perk? Yes! Please email us at corinne@riotheatre.caMore questions? Send us an email!""The Rio is East Van culture. Please save it"" — Roy Abraham""It’s a part of Vancouver that cannot be replaced.

For those who are passionate about witnessing this event, in order to see the eclipse in totality, you have to be in the right spot. The path of the shadow is a long one, but it is also narrow, meaning most people will have to travel great distances to see it.</p><p>In the interest of sharing this celestial event with the rest of the world in a way that has never been done before, we are creating a fictional narrative that unfolds in real time, live during the solar eclipse.</p><p>…and the live stream will be available to the world for <strong>free</strong>.</p><h3>The Story</h3><p>Western Sol tells the story of an honest and poor rancher, James Avery, who is coerced by a brood of outlaws into robbing a bank for them. The outlaws, led by an intelligent and sinister Davey Collins, lead Avery into town, where they all spread out to keep an eye on him. Feeling like he has no choice, Avery reluctantly agrees to follow through with the plan. But will he do it? Or will an opportunity arise to turn the tables on the outlaws?</p><h3>
<br/>Technically Speaking…</h3><p>There are a few challenges to overcome here, so let's review the requirements:</p><ul>
<li>Western story</li>
<li>Period-accurate representation</li>
<li>Real-time performances and execution</li>
<li>In the geographic path of the eclipse</li>
<li>Live streamed to the web</li>
</ul><p>So, how do we do this? A period-accurate western has its challenges, such as making sure props and attire are correct. This is the work of a great costumer and propmaster. We have an excellent pair of armorers attached to the project that, in addition to providing professional firearms safety supervision, are also providing period-accurate single-action revolvers and long guns and blank rounds.</p><p>In order to pull this off in real-time, we are treating this like a theatrical production. Using our background in theater and live television, as well as our experience in cinematic ""oners"" (pronounced won-erh), also known as a long take, we are carefully choreographing the camera and actors' blocking and timing for the entire piece. Our intent is to shoot the entire film as a oner, however we may end up breaking it up into more shots, depending on a few factors. The actors will receive direction and timing updates from the director via hidden wireless IFB earpieces, and if adjustments need to be made, they can do so without interrupting the show.</p><p>The path of the moon's shadow is very specific, and it's narrower than the layman might think. It's also very scientifically predictable, down to the exact latitude/longitude minutes and seconds, and the time-of-day millisecond. Our filming location is already locked, and it is a replica 19th century western town with a livery, bank, hotel, church, and of course, a saloon. It also happens to be almost dead-center in the path of totality, meaning, from this location, we will have a full, total eclipse, and the duration of that eclipse will be fairly long. The location truly is perfect for this project.</p><p>In order to live-stream this performance, there is a decent technological hurdle to jump: bandwidth. We are on a small ranch in the middle of Wyoming… while there is internet access, it's not really there for this type of thing. Can you imagine if we line all this up to go live, and the stream cuts out, or is of such low resolution that you can barely see it? To overcome this, we will bring a satellite truck and operator to the ranch. This will give us a high-bandwidth upload connection, as we beam our signal into space, where it will be relayed back down to a studio in Utah, then uploaded to the web. The latency on this type of upload will be approximately 15 seconds, which is pretty good. The satellite truck is already booked and committed-to, which is huge, considering the high demand for these trucks on this day.</p><h3>
<br/>Where does the money go?</h3><p>Frankly, short films do not usually cost this much money. Other than the standard expenses, there are a few factors that are working against us in regards to the budget.</p><ul>
<li>During the eclipse, all nearby hotels are mostly booked, and very costly. The alternative is to rent campers and have them on-site.</li>
<li>Live-streaming requires a satellite truck, and the rental of the satellite</li>
<li>Rehearsals take up additional time, which means more crew and longer equipment rentals</li>
<li>Given the live broadcast nature, we need to provide various redundancies, to ensure our success, even if there is technical failure.</li>
</ul><p>Live productions are inherently more expensive than your typical short film, and this is no different. Our budget is designed in a way that allows us to execute a version of this film with the IndieGoGo goal that we have set, but in reality, this is only meant to be partial funding. The more money we can raise, either through over-funding on IGG, or through marketing sponsorships, the more excellently we can execute this production. We have passed our go/no-go point already, so <strong>we <i>will</i> be filming Western Sol regardless</strong> of how much money we raise here.

<p>Sweet Like Poison is about a 16 year old girl named Dolly. She looks very young for her age which makes people perceive her as innocent and naive. She is shy but also has her own individual style that doesn't quite conform to the trends. All of this mixed together makes her classmates view her as a weirdo which leads them to exclude, ignore and bully her.  Dolly's loneliness leads her to create vivid and twisted fantasies which usually involve murder. When Dolly is the only one not invited to a party she decides enough is enough, it's time to turn her fantasies into reality. However, once she is finally let in, she finds herself having an unintentional heart to heart with the ones who are the most cruel to her and they realise they have more in common than they thought (minus the whole murderer thing) they all start enjoying themselves and for the first time Dolly is accepted - but it’s too late, her new friends have all eaten the poisoned cupcakes she made for them and they begin to die around her. Dolly is left alone once more.</p>
<p>This film mixes stereotypically feminine and pastel pink visuals with dark and often gruesome situations.</p>

<p>We are aiming to raise £1000 for our short film. It's an ambitious target but we believe we can smash it! Here is what the money is going towards: </p>
<p><strong>Locations: </strong></p>
<p>We are already lucky enough to have secured one location, Worthing College, but we are still on the look out for a beautiful vintage style house we can use for our interior scenes. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Actors:</strong></p>
<p>Student projects never have a big budget which has lead to them being notorious for not paying their actors. We want to change this. The majority of the money raised in our crowdfunding campaign will go towards paying our three amazingly talented actors.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Production Design:</strong></p>
<p>We are creating  surreal, pastel pink visuals which means we are relying on production design to turn our locations into this world. This does not come cheap so a lot of our budget will be going towards this. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Special Effects:</strong></p>
<p>Our opening scene takes place in a bath full of blood and this is more expensive to create than you might initially think. There are a number of other gorey scenes which will require special effects as well. It's important that we do these right so the film looks as polished and professional as we know it should. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Festivals:</strong></p>
<p>This film is our calling card as we enter the industry and we want to make our mark in the film festival circuit. This doesn't come cheap so money from our crowdfunding campaign will be going towards festival submissions.</p>

</div></div>","Sweet Like Poison is about a 16 year old girl named Dolly. She looks very young for her age which makes people perceive her as innocent and naive. She is shy but also has her own individual style that doesn't quite conform to the trends. All of this mixed together makes her classmates view her as a weirdo which leads them to exclude, ignore and bully her.  Dolly's loneliness leads her to create vivid and twisted fantasies which usually involve murder. When Dolly is the only one not invited to a party she decides enough is enough, it's time to turn her fantasies into reality. However, once she is finally let in, she finds herself having an unintentional heart to heart with the ones who are the most cruel to her and they realise they have more in common than they thought (minus the whole murderer thing) they all start enjoying themselves and for the first time Dolly is accepted - but it’s too late, her new friends have all eaten the poisoned cupcakes she made for them and they begin to die around her. Dolly is left alone once more.
This film mixes stereotypically feminine and pastel pink visuals with dark and often gruesome situations.


We are aiming to raise £1000 for our short film. It's an ambitious target but we believe we can smash it! Here is what the money is going towards: 
Locations: 
We are already lucky enough to have secured one location, Worthing College, but we are still on the look out for a beautiful vintage style house we can use for our interior scenes. 
 
Actors:
Student projects never have a big budget which has lead to them being notorious for not paying their actors. We want to change this. The majority of the money raised in our crowdfunding campaign will go towards paying our three amazingly talented actors.
 
Production Design:
We are creating  surreal, pastel pink visuals which means we are relying on production design to turn our locations into this world. This does not come cheap so a lot of our budget will be going towards this. 
 
Special Effects:
Our opening scene takes place in a bath full of blood and this is more expensive to create than you might initially think. There are a number of other gorey scenes which will require special effects as well. It's important that we do these right so the film looks as polished and professional as we know it should. 
 
Festivals:
This film is our calling card as we enter the industry and we want to make our mark in the film festival circuit. This doesn't come cheap so money from our crowdfunding campaign will be going towards festival submissions.
 

We have many incentives to offer to say thank you for your contribution. A donation of more than £10 will secure your name in the credits and there's also the chance to receive exclusive behind the scenes videos, to see the film before anyone else and even to spend the day on set!

<h3>About Us &amp; Our Film</h3>
<p>This short film was written by — and stars — Rob Walker. He directed TV movies for the BBC for years before he moved to southern Arizona, fell in love, and now has seven children. He wanted to explore a variety of compelling topics in an engaging way...and the ending is definitely a twist! </p>
<p>Liz Claire Feliciano, a Pittsburgh native, has been acting, singing, and dancing all her life. With her mother and brothers playing instruments growing up, and an uncle and cousins in bands and running a music store, Liz was destined for the arts. You can find her playing the harp at various venues around Tucson. This production marks her transition from the stage to the silver screen, and she’s excited to continue making art with Rob and Avai that challenges people to think critically and grow as human beings.</p>
<p>Avai d'Amico, cinematographer and adventurer, moved to Tucson for the warm climate and inexpensive cost of living, but quickly fell in love with dangerous hobbies like scaling vertical cliff faces and barreling full speed toward patches of cacti while riding on only two wheels. He is the co-chair of Independent Film Arizona's documentary group. </p>

Thousands of women fell victim to widespread societal misogyny. Among these women is six-year-old Lin. Raised by a widowed mother, Lin does not only have to toil with house work, she also has to find ways to make money to support her 8-year-old brother’s education.One day, her brother brings her surprising news: their mother has met a man who wants to relocate them to a place called Taiwan. Lin, thrilled that her dream of leaving Shajiang is about to come true, tosses and turns through a long sleepless night. But the next day, Lin wakes to an empty house, only to realize that she has been left behind.Key Art illustrated by Sue Lin_________________________________________________________________________________MAIN CHARACTERSLin (6), Smart and sensible, warm but doesn’t smile often. Growing up as a girl in rural China is tough. Though times are hard, Lin still manages to have fun and stay optimistic. She always looks to the ocean hoping that one day she will escape this place.*Reference photo pulled from movie ""Bedeviled.""Mother (25), Diligent, independent. Mother of two children at a very young age. Life became much more ruthless when she was widowed two years ago due to her husband’s sudden death. Overwhelmed by the heavy economic pressure of supporting the only male descendant in the family, she is about to make a huge decision which is going to change all their lives._________________________________________________________________________________DIRECTOR'S STATEMENT         I received a call from my mother one Sunday afternoon while I sat around doing nothing in my shabby Jersey City apartment. It was 3 am in China, where my mom was calling from. She told me that she had just had a nightmare about her mother, a nightmare she had been having since she was six. “I think I am probably never going to be able to forgive her,” she told me.         I was shocked. My mother was forty-five, which meant that she’d been having this nightmare for forty years. As the conversation unfolded, a piece of buried memory was unveiled.         Pearl is inspired and loosely based on this memory from my mother’s tragic past. I don’t intend to recreate her nightmare but I want to put myself in this little girl’s shoes and see what she saw, through the art of cinematic storytelling. By examining the event from different perspectives, I hope to better understand this traumatic moment. I believe that the process of writing and reexamining what went on in each character’s mind will help me shed some light on the complex fabric of the human condition._________________________________________________________________________________THE TEAMYuchao “Robbin” Feng | Writer/DirectorRobbin is an award-winning Chinese director/cinematographer who currently resides in New York.

Some people may find the idea of sleeping in a hammock in the rainforest a complete nightmare, whereas for me its a dream come true. Some years ago, I joined a research expedition into the green heart of Guyana doing just that and it was the most captivating experience of my life.

<p>Over 80% of Guyana is still wilderness. Spider monkeys swinging and howler monkeys roaring from trees as tall as skyscrapers, black caimans basking on the riverbanks and otherworldly blue butterflies landing on giant leaves are just a snapshot of its immersive beauty. But for all the brilliantly coloured and iridescent animals in Guyana's jungles, there is one giant grey bird with a history shrouded in myth and legend... The Harpy Eagle</p>
<p>Natasha Ellison, a mathematician, theoretical physicist and mathematical ecologist has spent years writing equations to describe how birds use their space. Her theoretical models, she one day hopes could be used in the fight to save the rainforest habitat of the Harpy Eagle. But her work, as much potential as it has, keeps her from chasing her life-long dream of seeing the formidable  and enigmatic bird in the wild...</p>
<p>Until now.</p>
<p>""To See the Grey"" is the story of PhD mathematician, Natasha Ellison, diving head first into the adventure of a life-time to realise a life-long dream and see one of the rarest birds of the Amazon rainforest in the wild - the Harpy Eagle.</p>
<h2>Natasha Ellison</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1523800799/uet8jmahg6nolisbwqxk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Manchester born mathematician and keen bird watcher, Natasha Ellison, has barely left her lab in the last two years. Her PhD at The University of Sheffield involves writing complex equations to describe how birds use their space - with hopes they could be used in rainforest conservation. However, a chance encounter in with a local in Belize sparked a passion for the Harpy Eagle, the most powerful bird on the planet and ever since, she has dreamt of seeing one in its natural habitat.</p>

<h3>The Harpy Eagle</h3>
<p>The incredibly rare and mysterious Harpy Eagle is the most powerful raptor on the planet.</p>

<p>Being right at the top of the food chain, the apex avian predator hunts animals as large as sloths and monkeys. With legs as big as a human arm, talons longer than a grizzly bear and a razor sharp beak, its easy to see how it received a name taken from that of Greek mythology.</p>

<p>But masked behind the gruesome appearance of this mysterious creature, there is a caring parent, a devoted partner, and an enduring survivor fighting hard for its existence in a rapidly shrinking home.</p>

<h2>The Locations</h2>
<p>Guyana is a small, low populated country on the north coast of South America. About 80% of Guyana is forested, approximately 60% of which is classified as primary rainforest. Guyana's forests are highly biodiverse - the country has an estimated 8,000 species of plants and 1,800 species of amphibians, birds and mammals. The country also has a high diversity of habitats from lowland rainforest, montane forest, swampland and marshland, dry evergreen forest, seasonal forest and mangroves.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1523807658/xpmgobv2f2fwhwd36h6e.png"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>Iwokrama International Centre for Rainforest Conservation and Development</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1523807840/qtdtba9sjglbfktialvs.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The IIC is an international not-for-profit organisation managed by staff in the Iwokrama forest interior and in Georgetown. It was established in 1996 through a joint mandate with the Guyanese government and the commonwealth to manage the incredibly diverse Iwokrama forest reserve or 371,000 hectares of rainforest.</p>
<h3>The Rupununi</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1523808202/lapxyyuquhrtdydvnwvm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The Rupununi is a region in the south-west of Guyana bordering the Brazilian Amazon within which lies the Surama, Yupukari and Katoka Amerindian villages that Natasha will visit on her quest. The Rupununi river, known also by its local indigenous name, Raponani, cuts through the Rupununi region and is one of the major tributaries of Guyana’s largest river, the Essequibo.</p>
<p>The Rupununi river’s direct and surrounding areas harbour a huge diversity of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems that are home to an even larger diversity of species no longer present in other parts of South America. The freshwater ecosystems of the Rupununi are of exceptional species richness, comparable to that of the Central Amazonia. Animals and plants are so successful in the Rupununi river because of the area’s separation from large-scale human activity.</p>
<p>The flora and undisturbed tree life down the Rupununi river, is a haven for many rare species of bird-life. some 300 bird species live along the river – one of which - the largest aerial predator in South America and Natasha's holy grail, the Harpy Eagle.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Guyana is a country that many people know little about. Not just that, it has a forward thinking and conservation minded attitude when it comes to its forests.</p>
<p>With this film, I want to raise awareness about the sustainable use practices run by the Iwokrama Centre and the conservation minded ecotourism ventures of the indigenous communities we meet along the way.</p>
<p>This film, I hope, will not just be the realisation of a life-long dream for Natasha, but will show people the beauty of a country and its forest, giving a message of hope in a time where a lot of what we hear about our natural world is the opposite. </p>
<h2>An Inspiration</h2>
<p>In the development of this story, I came across the much loved and maverick birder, Tim Cleeves, who sadly passed away in December. After reading about his story, I spoke to some of his friends and family. Tim's wife, Ann, wrote an inspiring post on her online journal urging people to be more like him, and to live life to its fullest in the face of any adversities. Her words and Tim's story have been a great inspiration to me as I'm sure they have been for many others:</p>
<p><i>""To take risks, be open to new possibilities and not let the fear of being hurt or rejected prevent us from approaching people and ideas with an open mind and an open heart. To dance, and cook, and drink, and walk, and perhaps break the rules every now and then.""</i></p>
<p><i>#BeMoreTim</i></p>

<p>Ashley was born in England but moved to South Africa at 3 months of age, where he grew up on remote farms in the Transvaal. It was here he developed his love of wild and remote places and learnt to speak Afrikaans. At the age of 10 Ash moved to Botswana on the edge of the Okavango Delta where his mother was running a lodge. After two years they re-migrated to England for a couple years of education before moving to Guyana, where Ashley’s mother set up a bush camp on the Mazaruni River.</p>
<p>In 1994 Ashley travelled to the Rupununi and fell in love with the area and lifestyle and commenced working at Karanambu Lodge. Since then he has learned about the area, its people and the incredible flora and fauna. Ash is most at home out in the bush, especially on the rivers where he can fish, observe wildlife, explore new and remote areas, and learn from the locals about bush lore. He considers he was born 100 years too late, and would have been best suited as an early explorer, or naturalist of some kind.</p>
<p>Ashley is now a well respected guide who enjoys leading small groups into the remote and wild areas of the Rupununi. He is an excellent boat captain and naturalist and will help Natasha on her quest to see the Harpy Eagle in the wild.</p>

Her theoretical models, she one day hopes could be used in the fight to save the rainforest habitat of the Harpy Eagle. But her work, as much potential as it has, keeps her from chasing her life-long dream of seeing the formidable  and enigmatic bird in the wild...
Until now.
""To See the Grey"" is the story of PhD mathematician, Natasha Ellison, diving head first into the adventure of a life-time to realise a life-long dream and see one of the rarest birds of the Amazon rainforest in the wild - the Harpy Eagle.
Natasha Ellison

Manchester born mathematician and keen bird watcher, Natasha Ellison, has barely left her lab in the last two years. Her PhD at The University of Sheffield involves writing complex equations to describe how birds use their space - with hopes they could be used in rainforest conservation. However, a chance encounter in with a local in Belize sparked a passion for the Harpy Eagle, the most powerful bird on the planet and ever since, she has dreamt of seeing one in its natural habitat.


The Harpy Eagle
The incredibly rare and mysterious Harpy Eagle is the most powerful raptor on the planet.

Being right at the top of the food chain, the apex avian predator hunts animals as large as sloths and monkeys. With legs as big as a human arm, talons longer than a grizzly bear and a razor sharp beak, its easy to see how it received a name taken from that of Greek mythology.

But masked behind the gruesome appearance of this mysterious creature, there is a caring parent, a devoted partner, and an enduring survivor fighting hard for its existence in a rapidly shrinking home.

The Locations
Guyana is a small, low populated country on the north coast of South America. About 80% of Guyana is forested, approximately 60% of which is classified as primary rainforest. Guyana's forests are highly biodiverse - the country has an estimated 8,000 species of plants and 1,800 species of amphibians, birds and mammals. The country also has a high diversity of habitats from lowland rainforest, montane forest, swampland and marshland, dry evergreen forest, seasonal forest and mangroves.


Iwokrama International Centre for Rainforest Conservation and Development

The IIC is an international not-for-profit organisation managed by staff in the Iwokrama forest interior and in Georgetown. It was established in 1996 through a joint mandate with the Guyanese government and the commonwealth to manage the incredibly diverse Iwokrama forest reserve or 371,000 hectares of rainforest.
The Rupununi

The Rupununi is a region in the south-west of Guyana bordering the Brazilian Amazon within which lies the Surama, Yupukari and Katoka Amerindian villages that Natasha will visit on her quest. The Rupununi river, known also by its local indigenous name, Raponani, cuts through the Rupununi region and is one of the major tributaries of Guyana’s largest river, the Essequibo.
The Rupununi river’s direct and surrounding areas harbour a huge diversity of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems that are home to an even larger diversity of species no longer present in other parts of South America. The freshwater ecosystems of the Rupununi are of exceptional species richness, comparable to that of the Central Amazonia. Animals and plants are so successful in the Rupununi river because of the area’s separation from large-scale human activity.
The flora and undisturbed tree life down the Rupununi river, is a haven for many rare species of bird-life. some 300 bird species live along the river – one of which - the largest aerial predator in South America and Natasha's holy grail, the Harpy Eagle.
The Impact
Guyana is a country that many people know little about. Not just that, it has a forward thinking and conservation minded attitude when it comes to its forests.
With this film, I want to raise awareness about the sustainable use practices run by the Iwokrama Centre and the conservation minded ecotourism ventures of the indigenous communities we meet along the way.
This film, I hope, will not just be the realisation of a life-long dream for Natasha, but will show people the beauty of a country and its forest, giving a message of hope in a time where a lot of what we hear about our natural world is the opposite. 
An Inspiration
In the development of this story, I came across the much loved and maverick birder, Tim Cleeves, who sadly passed away in December. After reading about his story, I spoke to some of his friends and family. Tim's wife, Ann, wrote an inspiring post on her online journal urging people to be more like him, and to live life to its fullest in the face of any adversities. Her words and Tim's story have been a great inspiration to me as I'm sure they have been for many others:
""To take risks, be open to new possibilities and not let the fear of being hurt or rejected prevent us from approaching people and ideas with an open mind and an open heart. To dance, and cook, and drink, and walk, and perhaps break the rules every now and then.""

The Crew
Dan O'Neill - Producer/Cinematographer


Dan has a BSc Zoology degree from The University of Sheffield. He worked in publicity, sales and creative direction as well as in international biological field research before beginning a masters in Wildlife Filmmaking at UWE Bristol. Dan co-founded the conservation minded wildlife film festival, Wilderland.
Jonny Poole - Second Camera/Sound

Jonny is an experienced camera operator and filmmaker working at the BBC in London. He has worked on projects both in the UK and abroad.
Ashley Holland

Ashley was born in England but moved to South Africa at 3 months of age, where he grew up on remote farms in the Transvaal. It was here he developed his love of wild and remote places and learnt to speak Afrikaans. At the age of 10 Ash moved to Botswana on the edge of the Okavango Delta where his mother was running a lodge. After two years they re-migrated to England for a couple years of education before moving to Guyana, where Ashley’s mother set up a bush camp on the Mazaruni River.
In 1994 Ashley travelled to the Rupununi and fell in love with the area and lifestyle and commenced working at Karanambu Lodge. Since then he has learned about the area, its people and the incredible flora and fauna. Ash is most at home out in the bush, especially on the rivers where he can fish, observe wildlife, explore new and remote areas, and learn from the locals about bush lore. He considers he was born 100 years too late, and would have been best suited as an early explorer, or naturalist of some kind.
Ashley is now a well respected guide who enjoys leading small groups into the remote and wild areas of the Rupununi. He is an excellent boat captain and naturalist and will help Natasha on her quest to see the Harpy Eagle in the wild.
Where Your Support Will Go
The money you donate will go straight into the production of the film, making a film is not cheap (especially in the jungle!) and although we have support with kit from UWE, the rest we have to raise ourselves so any help you can give will be amazing!

<p>""Amazigh"" - meaning ""free people"" in Berber - is an artistic short film, which aims at consolidating diverse art-forms with the authentic life experiences of Sofia, Aziz, and Brahim. Art is the single universal language in the world. These three unique individuals, from two separate parts of the world, found a common path through their passionate and ambitious endeavors. Indeed, their difficult childhood, as well as the struggles they encountered at every step of the way, have been surmounted due to the fact that these free people bravely danced and sang their way through their hurdles. Hereby, the given project not only exploits the incredible stories of those remarkable artists, but also allows for further artistic expansion. </p>
<p>Our main production team includes the following members: </p>
<p>- Centre Social et Culturel l'Escale: Producer</p>
<p>- Sofia and Amad: Executive Producers</p>
<p>- Yann and Hayk: Co-directors</p>
<p>""Amazigh"" is of crucial importance to us, for it redefines freedom through music. The realization of the given project will inhibit us to further explore possibilities of mixing various art forms - in this case, flamenco, hip-hop, moroccan music - all the whilst creating something truly exceptional. Moreover, our team believes that these artists deserve the proper recognition, because let's admit it, they are incredible! </p>
<p>The success of this project will open new doors for future possibilities of exploiting the potential of these artists, meanwhile exploring new opportunities with regards to up-and-coming artists, seeking to experiment new and innovative ideas, and showcase their talents. </p>
<p>Significant investments have already been made to complete phase one, which consisted of shooting the first part of the movie in Strasbourg, France. ""L'Escale"" has contributed around 7000 euros from its personal resources to make this project a reality. </p>
<p>However, phase 2 - filming in Morocco - will require an additional investment of 8000 euros, which will cover the following expenses: traveling fees, technical equipment (ex: camera, ronin, drone rentals), housing, costumes, accessories, decoration, and local transport fees. </p>
<p>In exchange, for the corresponding amounts of investments, contributors benefit from personal interviews with the actors of the short film; an exclusive preview of the film; a copy of the film in DVD format; and personal recognition as associate producers in the credits of the film. </p>
<p>In case, the campaign doesn't reach it's final goal and the required funds are not raised, all collected funds will nonetheless be invested in the development of the film. </p>
<p>Since we have already successfully completed phase one of the short film, the main risk we face for phase two is not being able to raise the necessary amount in order to complete the motion picture. However, in the eventuality that we will face such an impediment, we will either rework the script to adapt it to more feasible conditions, or foresee a longer period of time during which we can implement the second phase in Morocco. </p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u>The Story</u></h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Cardboard Dreams is an original screenplay written by Tucker Hampson, based on his childhood experiences and memories with his father.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">In this Sci-fi/Fantasy, Neil Manning (not Armstrong,  but that's the idea) builds his space-obsessed son, Timmy, a cardboard spaceship. While Timmy enjoys  his new toy immensely, Neil becomes curious of his son's make believe after Timmy produces a space rock from his travels. Neil investigates, even going so far as to get inside the cardboard spaceship and press a few buttons.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">To his surprise, the cardboard rumbles to life and blasts off from earth. Neil passes out in his terror, and wakes up in a still and quiet cardboard box. When he emerges, he finds himself on an unknown planet. Awestruck, Neil explores and finds an identical rock to the one Timmy had.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Neil quickly returns home and calls NASA with his findings, but when a NASA representative arrives, Neil discovers  that Timmy has torn up the cardboard ship, leaving nothing to prove the miraculous trip besides the pair of space rocks. </p>

</div><p> </p></div>","The Story
Cardboard Dreams is an original screenplay written by Tucker Hampson, based on his childhood experiences and memories with his father.
In this Sci-fi/Fantasy, Neil Manning (not Armstrong,  but that's the idea) builds his space-obsessed son, Timmy, a cardboard spaceship. While Timmy enjoys  his new toy immensely, Neil becomes curious of his son's make believe after Timmy produces a space rock from his travels. Neil investigates, even going so far as to get inside the cardboard spaceship and press a few buttons.
To his surprise, the cardboard rumbles to life and blasts off from earth. Neil passes out in his terror, and wakes up in a still and quiet cardboard box. When he emerges, he finds himself on an unknown planet. Awestruck, Neil explores and finds an identical rock to the one Timmy had.
Neil quickly returns home and calls NASA with his findings, but when a NASA representative arrives, Neil discovers  that Timmy has torn up the cardboard ship, leaving nothing to prove the miraculous trip besides the pair of space rocks.

What We Need
Science Fiction and Fantasy films are generally prohibitively expensive and difficult to create, especially for student filmmakers. The hope is to blend a low budget, do-it-yourself mentality and skills with creative techniques to create an authentic and powerful science fiction film without spending tens of thousands of dollars on production.

$1,250 is the allotted budget for this film to be successful. Much of this will be used to secure a location, a beach or desert, that will look like another planet. This is absolutely essential to create the illusion of the film.
Another costly part of the film is being able to work with a child actor, which requires a studio teacher on set at all times. The other smaller chunk will be used for character costumes and props, and set design to make the cardboard box come alive as much as possible.
The final expense is to feed and transport the crew and cast, who will be working for no pay and deserve to be treated as professionally as possible. 
ANY amount of money helps, even if we don't reach our goal! The more we receive, the better the film will be!

<p>Hi, I’m Elizabeth Sampson, I’m the writer and Scott Alan Smith is the director of this short film. We have both been making theatre together for over 30 years and been acting in television and film since 1991. I’ve been writing plays since 1996. We are making a short film based on one of my full length plays about a cottage on a lake in upstate Michigan. All the contributors to this project will be entirely responsible for it getting made. You will all be producers of this film and some of you will get to be in it. </p>
<p>For those of you at Lakeside, Cottage Grove and Pinewoods – Scott and I were the ones who brought you A Midsummer Night’s Dream in the Dell ten years ago.</p>
<p>We need to raise $20k. This will cover bringing 9 actors and a few crew members from Los Angeles to shoot this short. The cast are all veterans of film and television, some of whom might be quite familiar to you from shows you’ve seen them in. We have some fun perks – look at the list of things you get for donating. We have signed posters, dinner with the cast, I have included scarves and two pieces of jewelry that I make and for those of you who want to be “big producers” you get to be in the film. The money would cover union fees, food, lodging, costumes, rental equipment, airfare and insurance.</p>
<p>Scott and I believe this film is important because it is about love, loss and legacy – things that every family goes through and deals with, and I believe that framing those issues with the beauty of this lake and these woods makes this story potent, poignant and powerful.</p>
<p>As far as risks…the only risk here is that we don’t raise enough funds to finish the project. Although Scott and I have been in many films, this is our first time helming a production and we anticipate making a few mistakes. But that will be part of the fun, sometimes mistakes lead to the most magical solutions beyond what you had initially intentioned, or could have imagined.</p>

<h3>The Film</h3>
<p>Sean has lived in London for the past few years chasing a career as a rap artist. Reaching his mid-30s, the loss of his girlfriend and a sense that he has failed in his career and his relationships has led him to the point of being ready to take his own life. Days before he plans to end it all, he visits his family in the north of England one last time where they hold an unexpected intervention for him.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>About Me</strong></h3>
<p>My name is Marcus Lee, I'm a filmmaker from Bradford, West Yorkshire. I set up Reel Street Films, a video production company in 2007 with the hope of helping young people by telling engaging stories through drama and documentary. Since its inception I've created short films and feature films about subjects such as family, relationships, marriage, mental health, life and death amongst other topics.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Campaign and It's Importance</strong></h3>
<p>This film will be the most personal film I have ever made. I myself have had feelings of depression, anxiety and suicide with the sense of my own life not moving forward like I believed it should have at the time. If you've lived through your 20s/30s and watched your peers do all the things that Western society expects of you (graduate from university, get a high paying job, get married, purchase a big house, have children, drive a nice car) but you haven't done any of those things yourself, a sense of disappointment can rest on you which is partly due to the conventions of society. This film brings all of those pieces together to focus on an individual ready to take his own life, who like many others who feel like this won't show their feelings outwardly; to put it another way, they suffer in silence. </p>
<p>I feel like a film like this is important because it addresses the pressure that millions of young adults face in a world where the pressures to keep up with technology, look good on social media and fight for success in the workplace and ""keep up with the Jones's"" in our personal lives are never ending. I believe millions of people will be able to relate to the main character's plight in this film.</p>
<p><strong>So why should you give to this campaign?</strong></p>
<p>Simple answer, your contribution will help to bring this film to life! By supporting this project you will be supporting the creation of a feature length film that will be entered into film festivals across the world, be available to watch online through video on demand and potentially be available in stores should we find a distributor. This is a film with a small budget, but a budget sufficient that we will be able to create a product of great quality and strong production values. It isn't an expensive or flashy project, but it does require financial contributions to make it happen. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Often when there is a main character in a film we watch at the cinema or on our televisions, there are often several things we can't relate to about them. They are a superhero, an action hero with an amazing knowledge of science, or a high flying member of society who is going to change the world. This film features an everyday person who we can all relate to, as his issues of mental health and emotional wellbeing are things we all experience. I thoroughly believe the film will have positive ramifications, in terms of creating a dialogue around men, women and suicidal feelings, depression and the importance of the relationships around us.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>So how much does this cost?</strong></p>
<p>I've budgeted this project at £9,000. This is filmmaking at its most affordable level. Funds will pay for actors, production staff, equipment, locations and food! I've kept the budget as low as possible to make the project happen. Considering low budget cinema is considered to be for films made around the one million pound mark, this is considerably smaller! The way this is possible is that we are not an overly fancy production with trailers for actors demanding high fees and bowls of only red skittles. A small production team will be in place to make this happen over two to three weeks, but if additional funds are available, we will be able to attract additional production staff to make everything run smoother and faster.</p>
<p>If the funds aren't reached entirely, we will use it to honour people's expenses and travel costs, and pay for the fundamental parts of producing this film. We will try and obtain as many items for production for the lowest possible and most affordable costs possible, whilst not trying to dishonour people's time, talent and willingness to bring the project to life.</p>
<p><strong>So what do you get out of the film as a contributor?</strong></p>

</div></div>","The Film
Sean has lived in London for the past few years chasing a career as a rap artist. Reaching his mid-30s, the loss of his girlfriend and a sense that he has failed in his career and his relationships has led him to the point of being ready to take his own life. Days before he plans to end it all, he visits his family in the north of England one last time where they hold an unexpected intervention for him.
 
About Me
My name is Marcus Lee, I'm a filmmaker from Bradford, West Yorkshire. I set up Reel Street Films, a video production company in 2007 with the hope of helping young people by telling engaging stories through drama and documentary. Since its inception I've created short films and feature films about subjects such as family, relationships, marriage, mental health, life and death amongst other topics.
 
The Campaign and It's Importance
This film will be the most personal film I have ever made. I myself have had feelings of depression, anxiety and suicide with the sense of my own life not moving forward like I believed it should have at the time. If you've lived through your 20s/30s and watched your peers do all the things that Western society expects of you (graduate from university, get a high paying job, get married, purchase a big house, have children, drive a nice car) but you haven't done any of those things yourself, a sense of disappointment can rest on you which is partly due to the conventions of society. This film brings all of those pieces together to focus on an individual ready to take his own life, who like many others who feel like this won't show their feelings outwardly; to put it another way, they suffer in silence. 
I feel like a film like this is important because it addresses the pressure that millions of young adults face in a world where the pressures to keep up with technology, look good on social media and fight for success in the workplace and ""keep up with the Jones's"" in our personal lives are never ending. I believe millions of people will be able to relate to the main character's plight in this film.
So why should you give to this campaign?
Simple answer, your contribution will help to bring this film to life! By supporting this project you will be supporting the creation of a feature length film that will be entered into film festivals across the world, be available to watch online through video on demand and potentially be available in stores should we find a distributor. This is a film with a small budget, but a budget sufficient that we will be able to create a product of great quality and strong production values. It isn't an expensive or flashy project, but it does require financial contributions to make it happen. 
 
The Impact
Often when there is a main character in a film we watch at the cinema or on our televisions, there are often several things we can't relate to about them. They are a superhero, an action hero with an amazing knowledge of science, or a high flying member of society who is going to change the world. This film features an everyday person who we can all relate to, as his issues of mental health and emotional wellbeing are things we all experience. I thoroughly believe the film will have positive ramifications, in terms of creating a dialogue around men, women and suicidal feelings, depression and the importance of the relationships around us.

 
What We Need & What You Get
So how much does this cost?
I've budgeted this project at £9,000. This is filmmaking at its most affordable level. Funds will pay for actors, production staff, equipment, locations and food! I've kept the budget as low as possible to make the project happen. Considering low budget cinema is considered to be for films made around the one million pound mark, this is considerably smaller! The way this is possible is that we are not an overly fancy production with trailers for actors demanding high fees and bowls of only red skittles. A small production team will be in place to make this happen over two to three weeks, but if additional funds are available, we will be able to attract additional production staff to make everything run smoother and faster.
If the funds aren't reached entirely, we will use it to honour people's expenses and travel costs, and pay for the fundamental parts of producing this film. We will try and obtain as many items for production for the lowest possible and most affordable costs possible, whilst not trying to dishonour people's time, talent and willingness to bring the project to life.
So what do you get out of the film as a contributor?
There are several perks to contributing to this project! As well as being part of the team who bring this project to life, there are a few choice items that will sweeten the deal. Depending on the amount you are able to give, you could receive a digital download of a rap music EP, written by the character Sean from his perspective. There is also the option of being able to attend an advance screening of the film, get invited to the official premiere of the film, receive posters of the film, get private digital copies of the film.

I understand that everyone can't contribute financially, but there are other ways you can support us. Do you know of someone who this project might strike a chord with? Could you share it with them?

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Cory Rowe and I’m the writer and director of the film “How To Train Your Boyfriend”.  Just the title alone makes you laugh.  I have always enjoyed making people smile, laugh, and be entertained and I feel this is a way that I can share it with the world.</p>
<p>“How To Train Your Boyfriend” came about just as a random thought.  The title is what I came up with first and I thought to myself “How and why would a woman want to train her man?”  And then I thought “Dumb question!”  So I came up with the theme “You can’t teach an old dog new tricks”.</p>
<p>This campaign is important because movies these days are remakes, sequels, and prequels.  This gives an original idea to be put out into the universe for people to see.  We as people strive for entertainment and to escape reality.  What better way than to go see a movie about training your man?</p>
<p>Let’s be realistic though.  Can a man really be changed?  What is it that drives you nuts that he does or doesn’t do?  What needs aren’t being fulfilled?  There are many reasons why men don’t listen or seem like they don’t care.  But those stats aren't what this film is about.  Rather that the questions I ask are more rhetorical.  This film shows how a group of women try to train their men and may succeed.  Or they may fail.  The only way to know for sure is to get the movie made and we need your help with that.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So the funding we need is to pay for our named talent, remainder of cast, crew, and post-production needs.  We have acquired a well-known song for the dance off sequence in the film which brings out more of the comedy. </p>
<p>To make the best movie possible, sometimes it takes some money to make.   But we have some pretty neat rewards for you supporters, no matter how little or big you contribute.</p>
<p>If we don’t reach our goal, we still will get the funds of those who have contributed and we will be making the film the best we can at that point.  So in advance, thank you!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact you have by contributing is huge.  Every dollar earned is one dollar towards our goal.  It means so much to us that you are contributing to our film and to help make it be the best film possible.  I believe when people see this film at festivals.  This film will be sent to festivals across the US.  If all goes well with the short, then next step will be to make it into a feature length film. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Every film has risks and challenges.  I have a great team that support the idea, the film, and each other.  We anticipate there are going to be some struggles, but with the funds we obtain, we can ensure that we will get done what we need to get done.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you’re not able to contribute, please don’t hesitate to share the link to the IndieGoGo page.  Every share is equivalent to a contribution.  Make some noise with this film.  Spread the word.  Share our IMDB page.  If you are able to send us proof that you have shared the page and obtain 15 LIKES, then we will give you a Special Thank You at the End Credits.</p>

<p>Films cost money. </p>
<p>We're seeking to raise $100,000 in order to complete this project. We've provided an abbreviated list below that explains what those funds will be going to:</p>
<p>   - Cast </p>
<p>   - Crew</p>
<p>   - Locations </p>
<p>   - Equipment </p>
<p>   - Permits </p>

<p>   - Travel and lodging </p>

<p>In return for your generous donation, we've got several cool perks that include walk-on roles in the film, producer credits, and cool autographed film swag. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are in a moment where prison reform and sentence reform are a hot topic. While several documentaries have been put out in the past few years, we've not seen very many narrative films that speak to this extremely important topic. Art will always be an amazing vehicle used to get a message to the masses. </p>
<p>It is important that people understand how detrimental a false conviction is to the life of the person and their family. In addition, it is hurtful to the family of the victim. For many, a conviction is the closing of a very painful chapter. If the conviction is not true, the system has done a disservice to the family that it was serving as well. </p>
<p>As we stated before, we pray this starts a conversation in our communities. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are several challenges that come with filmmaking. The biggest of which is usually weather. There's, also, last minute cast swaps. Locations that have been secured for months might slip through your fingers hours before you are supposed to shoot. All kinds of crazy things happen when you are trying to create. However, our team is comprised of individuals that have a collective twenty years of experience in between them. We know how to turn a mishap into magic without breaking a sweat. </p>

What We Need & What You Get

Films cost money. 
We're seeking to raise $100,000 in order to complete this project. We've provided an abbreviated list below that explains what those funds will be going to:
   - Cast 
   - Crew
   - Locations 
   - Equipment 
   - Permits 
   - Food
   - Insurance 
   - Travel and lodging 
   - Post-Production  (Editing, Color Grading, Composing) 
In return for your generous donation, we've got several cool perks that include walk-on roles in the film, producer credits, and cool autographed film swag. 

The Impact
We are in a moment where prison reform and sentence reform are a hot topic. While several documentaries have been put out in the past few years, we've not seen very many narrative films that speak to this extremely important topic. Art will always be an amazing vehicle used to get a message to the masses. 
It is important that people understand how detrimental a false conviction is to the life of the person and their family. In addition, it is hurtful to the family of the victim. For many, a conviction is the closing of a very painful chapter. If the conviction is not true, the system has done a disservice to the family that it was serving as well. 
As we stated before, we pray this starts a conversation in our communities. 

Risks & Challenges
There are several challenges that come with filmmaking. The biggest of which is usually weather. There's, also, last minute cast swaps. Locations that have been secured for months might slip through your fingers hours before you are supposed to shoot. All kinds of crazy things happen when you are trying to create. However, our team is comprised of individuals that have a collective twenty years of experience in between them. We know how to turn a mishap into magic without breaking a sweat.

<h2>The Story</h2>
<p><strong><i>     Kingsnake</i></strong> is a southern gothic story about a woman, Anna, who was forced into prostitution by Kingsnake, the local hustler. Years after her escape, Anna has returned to enforce her judgement.  </p>

<h3>PLOT</h3>
<p>Remus and Ron tells the story of how Remus a 35-year-old eccentric and awkward man ended up in the back of a police car arrested for murder. He looks back on his childhood and reminisces on how he turned out so different from his identical twin brother Ron, despite being inflicted the same bizarre and abusive upbringing.  Exploring themes of nurture vs nature and twisting the stereotypes of a conventional serial thriller, Remus and Ron is a dark and disturbing look at how one twin could be so evil and the other so caring.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534137808/wplbuu3js3vf7xdo9058.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>STYLE</h3>
<p>Remus and Ron is currently being pitched as a mix of Taxi Driver, Dead Ringers, and Mindhunter. The influence of David Fincher’s Mindhunter is not just evident in the story’s exploration of psychopaths but also in the cinematography and directing style. The dark contrasty look of Fincher’s TV and films, plus his smooth cinematic camera style, and precise performances are a massive influence on this film. </p>
<p>Any filmmakers planning to make a twin film need to study David Cronenberg’s masterpiece Dead Ringers featuring the duel performance by Jeremy Irons. And the filmmakers of Remus and Ron have deeply studied it and it’s making of and will be using similar split screen techniques to bring our multiple duel-performances film to life.</p>
<p>There is no movie out there that has succeeded better than Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver at immersing the audience into the head of a character. Using similar voice-over, slow-paced editing, sound design, and scoring techniques as (one of the director’s favourite films) Taxi Driver that is exactly what we aim to achieve with Remus and Ron.</p>

<h3>WHY MAKE THE FILM:</h3>
<p>Not only is this a great opportunity for the cast to show off their acting skills by acting opposite themselves on screen, this short will also be a big step up in the crew’s future career as feature filmmakers. Despite having multiple award winning short film credits the crew are currently in a grey zone of too inexperienced to receive Government funding but without funding can’t gain that needed experience. This is also an opportunity for the crew to explore a darker side of their story telling skills, something the writer/director in particular has been itching to do. </p>

<p><strong>Statement: </strong>Every experience is relative.

<p>The short you just watched, ""Pasta Primavera"", is the prelude to our upcoming short film in which Jim (the guy that yacked all over the place) goes to the doctor and has one hell of an experience when his routine physical exam goes off the rails.</p>
<p>Filmmaking aside for a moment as we would like to first introduce ourselves and further describe the purpose of our campaign. We are Roger Turner Jr and Dylan J. Murphy, the founders of UpStream Films, and we thank you for paying a visit and checking out our profile! This Summer on July 9-11th we are shooting our latest short film titled ""Physical"", which has gained esteem on the short film screenplay competition over the last six months. Not to mention, this will be our seventh short film production since 2016, and given the recent success of the script for ""Physical"", we can hardly wait to shoot it! </p>
<p>This campaign for our production provides us with the unique opportunity to not only finance our film, which will be shot on-location in Brooklyn, New York, but also the chance to generate a viable following for our film via the Internet, social media, and even film festivals. Our ultimate goal is for this short film to be selected for major film festivals such as the Sundance Film Festival, Tribeca Film Festival, and many others of equal caliber. To achieve this goal, we have culminated a cast of trained actors and a crew with in-depth knowledge and experience in the indie filmmaking world. Over the last five years we have devoted ourselves to our passion for acting, directing, writing, and storytelling and the production of ""Physical"" is a product of our commitment to put our best work on display.</p>
<p>In February 2020, Dylan began writing ""Physical"" from an idea about a neurotic guy in a doctor's office. Eventually, he wrote the script and began entering the final draft into film festivals in mid to late 2020. Low and behold, Dylan (the actor) had a script that was ranked among the Top 20 comedy short scripts on coverfly.com for the months of October 2020 and currently ranked #18 in the month of April 2021. It has been incredible to see the surge of positive feedback the script has received from judges at competitions like the Atlanta Screenplay Competition and Screencraft Short Comedy Competiton to name a few, which has ultimately inspired us to pursue bringing this script to screen.</p>
<p>Based on the critical acclaim the script for ""Physical"" has received prior to production, we are confident bringing this story to life will provide the opportunity to produce our dark comedy feature screenplay, ""That's My Time"", which is an even darker concept based directly off of Jim's experience in ""Physical"". The two projects are complimentary of one another as the story advances to an even more shocking ending than what Jim experiences in ""Pasta Primavera"" and ""Physical"". All things considered, the goal of our campaign is to raise enough funds to cover all associated location, professional equipment, cast, crew, insurance, and post production fees. If independently producing short films over the last five years has taught us anything, it is that you cannot achieve your true potential on your own. Any and all support towards our campaign goal is greatly appreciated!</p>

<h3>What we're about</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Andrea Garcia! I'm a 4th year first-generation Latina student at Westmont College but I'm originally from Hawthorne, CA. I'm obtaining a B.A. in Business/Economics along with a minor in Film Studies. I have previously worked with nonprofits, such as Child Home International, on commission video editing work to help support their goals and projects. Just last year I assisted in documenting and editing together interviews with homeowners/renters, businessmen and women, and those personally experiencing homelessness in Santa Barbara for a reconciliation summit in order to bring together the community into common ground on why we should all care about a rise in the number of those experiencing homelessness in this city. During this process, I noticed that East Side Santa Barbara in particular was impacted a lot if not the most by this issue. And yet, nobody outside of the East Side really knows its history or struggles despite the fact it holds valuable resources such as Path (a homeless shelter), amazing family-owned restaurants as well, housing for Westmont College students and many remain in East Side Santa Barbara post-college or during the summers, markets and convenience stores, and is just as a whole is very essential in a lot of people's lives and has amazing people. Thus, it is important to educate ourselves, even just a little bit, on the history and current struggles and triumphs of the community we are living in. It is also very important to take the time to understand the needs, concerns, and wants of this community, which includes those experiencing homelessness. They all deserve the best and deserve a documentary that is professional and well put together. None of that can be possible without help from you though. That help can look like so many things: it can be a small donation or a larger donation, it can be sending out this link to others, and it can be continued support from you. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What we need your help with</h3>
<p>I want to keep this process as simple and comfortable as possible for everybody involved. That being said, the equipment you would be funding has been researched and carefully selected with that in mind. As larger, more high-tech cameras can be intimidating, I have opted to use Moment iPhone lenses. They're smaller so hopefully, they're less daunting, and despite their size, they offer a more professional, sleek feel to pictures and videos. Thus, none of the professionalism or quality is lost. At the moment only two lenses are going to be used (Wide 18mm and Anamorphic Lens-Blue Flare). Both come out to a total of $249.99 and with the case necessary to mount them it comes out to $274.98. The OM 5 Smartphone Gimbal is $159.99 and will be used to stabilize videos in recordings as well as act as a tripod for interviews. The last bit for the making of the documentary is Adobe Premiere Pro to edit everything together which works on a monthly basis so 4 months total for $83.96. I am also asking for $100 or more in order to buy food, water, hygiene products, pet supplies, and other things for those experiencing homelessness. As the target goal may not be met, I will cut out the Gimbal and a lense if necessary in order to keep a good portion of the proceeds for those necessities for those experiencing homelessness.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The impact</h3>
<p>Your help can bring a very important history and story to light and hopefully make a difference in this topic. As I understand that none of this would be possible without your help, I am providing my email (andgarcia@westmont.edu). Please reach out to me if you have any questions, as I am more than happy to answer them. I want to be as transparent as possible and bring you along for the journey. </p>

This is a passion project that we strongly believe will garner a warm welcome and fast growing fan base. It's genre deals with the four quadrants of our human experience: The Physical, The Mental, The Emotional and The Spiritual.  
Our goal is to use this short film to pave the way for the full length feature film. With your help, we will make a great movie that you will enjoy and be proud to say you helped make it happen.  
We are excited you have decided to join us on this journey and Thank You from the depth of our hearts.

That's a Wrap! (On Principle Photography)
It started with two! Kerry Fleming and Shanda Renee. Nearly a year later, not without some hurdles and challenges, all to be expected, we completed several drafts of a script, we brought our characters to life with our brilliant cast, we hired an amazing team and crew, and we shot a movie! 
We are now in post production, bringing this gem together with editing, special effects, and music! 
We still need you!

What We Need & What You Get

Props
Transportation
Camera Equipment
Wardrobe, Hair, Makeup
Lighting 
Food to feed the Cast and Crew
Sound, Editing and Post Production
Film Festival Submissions 
and more...

That all costs money. 
Your contribution directly goes to paying for all of that, so we can produce and deliver to you, a great movie. 
Not only will you get the bragging rights to say you helped make a movie, we have also created a variety of fun perks we think you will love!

Things like having your name in the credits as a special thank you!
An invitation to our VIP lounge to mingle with our cast and crew.
A visit to set!
Even the opportunity to get your IMDB Credit as an Associate Producer or even, an Executive Producer!


There are many perks for any budget. Check them out now and pick the one that works for you.
The Impact
We are in the business of entertaining and story telling through the art of motion picture. 

The completion of this short film will allow us to submit to many film festivals to help us achieve our next goal of funding and producing the full feature length film. 
Our team members have written, produced and acted in many large scale productions that have garnered awards and made millions in the box office. 
Your contribution allows us to meet our goal and get our movie made. 


Risks & Challenges
Not every project goes as planned but our goal is to be sure that no matter what challenges we may face, that we will take them as opportunities to grow and learn. 

Our team has been in the film industry for many years and is ready to face any challenge head on. Knowing, when there is a will, there is a way.
We have skill, vision and professionalism in order to overcome any obstacle.

<h3>About the film...</h3>
<p>Women By The Sea is Ruby Rees' (Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries, Picnic At Hanging Rock) debut feature film. Set over one weekend at the picturesque Phillip Island, Victoria, the film explores the relationships between five women, friends since childhood as they embark on a weekend away together and attempt to reconnect after years apart. At it's heart this film is a story of female endurance, of the complex and powerful bonds that bind women to one another, oh and paintball...</p>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>We're asking for $10,000 which in the world of film making is actually nothing major, but it will make a huge difference to this production. These funds will go towards key production costs including; </p>
<p>Development Workshops with Cast </p>
<p>Travel Costs</p>
<p>Catering for the Cast and Crew </p>
<p>Hot Water Bottles, Scarves and Warm Coats for Cold Actors </p>
<p>Art Department Needs (So the final product looks the best it can for you guys!)</p>
<p>Scroll down on our campaign to check out the prizes you receive for supporting this project, and pledging. We'll keep adding to them, so keep checking back!</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We're hoping that the Impact of supporting a film employing females only will be monumental in the future of how we make Film and Television. In the last 12 months we have been witness to the beginning of the modern revolution, with females speaking out again inequality and sexism across all industries. Women are calling out harassment, abuse, unequal pay and employment opportunities. It is our time, and our time is long overdue. By making a film and employing women only to do it, we are shining a spotlight on an industry that for too long has been accepted as a ""boys club"". The world wants to hear from the minorities now, and while we are only one project, we hope that this film, and the story behind it will make enough of an impact that we start to see inclusion riders on every single Australian Screen Project in the future. </p>

However, I believe in my vision and I'm starting to learn about different ways to support my ideas, expanding my network and I hope to inspire others to keep going.
I'm very devoted to what I do and I have a lot of energy which all goes into my work. So, you'll be supporting an emerging artist in these challenging yet defining times of finding her own voice and getting it out there.
 
Your support can make this vision take shape!
