<p style=""text-align: center;"">I am a very active mother and was babywearing all 3 of my babies until they were 2 y.o. It was very important for me to keep doing my things, work and care of the family without separating with my babies. As I was living in a very cold climate, in winter it was very hard to wear kids outdoors, and outerwear options offered on the market were very uncomfortable &amp; expensive. <br/><strong>So together with Italian designers I have developed a design that has become the most advanced and comfortable for parenting in the world. </strong></p>

Diva outerwear is produced at the ISO-certified factory, under the control of the company professionals.
Hi! I'm Elena, Co-founder of Diva Milano and a Mom of 3! 

I am a very active mother and was babywearing all 3 of my babies until they were 2 y.o. It was very important for me to keep doing my things, work and care of the family without separating with my babies. As I was living in a very cold climate, in winter it was very hard to wear kids outdoors, and outerwear options offered on the market were very uncomfortable & expensive. So together with Italian designers I have developed a design that has become the most advanced and comfortable for parenting in the world. 

Our goal was to create a jacket that will be perfect in each possible use: regular coat, maternity, babywearing. Features that makes it a great piece of outerwear even without babywearing:
✅ 100% water resistant & windproof fabricYou will get complete protection from wind and heavy rain, but not feel as if covered with rubber, the fabric is breathable and lightweight.
✅ High-tech lightweight Shelter® insulationModern thin-fiber material with maximum warming capacity with the minimum volume and weight. 2 temperature options: -10C°/+14°F & -25C°/-13°F (depending on the model)
✅ All inserts included, no need to purchase anything extra, it includes(1) detachable maternity insert;(2) detachable babywearing insert;(3) detachable mother's collar;(4) detachable baby's hood with collar

Front babywearing function gives perfect comfort & warmth both to you and your baby:
✅ Special mother's & baby's neck protectionInnovative system mother's collar + baby's hood with collar gives a 100% protection from cold to your neck & chest; as well as allows to use the jacket from birth to 2-3 years
✅ Perfect adjustabilityAll inserts, collars, hoods, sleeves & belt are fully adjustable. This is important because you body is changing and the baby is growing, so the coat should change with you!Cords with fixers on inserts are hidden (adjusted from the inner side) 
✅ Perfect baby controlWe made 2 rows of zippers from each insert side, with central openings;meaning any moment you can reach your baby without taking off the whole jacket.

Back babywearing was never so comfortable & safe:
✅ Rollable mother's hoodWhen the hood is not used, you can fix it in a roll, to avoid any risk of baby's suffocation.
✅ Special mother's back protectionWe have developed a special system with an inner fabric layer under the mother's hood, to protect your back from cold when a baby is behind.

  
Please note the Diva jacket is not a baby carrier and needs a baby to be in a baby carrier (of any brand) under it!

We are using a special high-tech lightweight Shelter® insulation.This is a modern thin-fiber material with maximum warming capacity with the minimum volume and weight.
Shelter is made of very thin & light polymer fibers that are fixed under high temperature to create a special porous texture. The material is very elastic & homogeneous. Due to a large number of cells it is very breathable but ensures maximum warmth protection.
All these qualities makes Shelter a much lighter & practical insulation materialvs. down, feathers or any regular synthetic materials

Shelter® INSULATION:
✅ Lighter then down;✅ Dries quickly & stays lofted even when wet;✅ Breathable & does not keep moisture inside.


Currently there are very few brands producing multifunctional babywearing outerwear& we are absolutely sure that Diva Milano is offering the most elaborate design and using the best materials vs. competitors, for a lower price.

There are models that have an insert with a hole in it for a baby's head, and we really do not recommend it for the following reason:




Model 1. High-Warm
(Temperatures from +0°C/32°F to -25°C /-13°F
one color: Grafite

Model 2. Medium-Warm
(Temperatures from +10°C/50°F to -10C°/14°F)
three colors: Notte (Grey Blue), Nero (Black Snowflakes) & Azzurro (Blue Snowflakes)

To choose your size, please check the size chart.TIP: Most important is your chest size.


IMPORTANT! if the size of the jacket you ordered will not suite you, we will replace it for another size for free. 

If you live in a warmer climate and do not need a warm jacket, we offer a nice 4in1 hoodie, with almost the same features that a Diva jacket.

Special features of the hoodie:
✅ Natural warm fabric (cotton fleece)70% cotton, 30% PE warm fabric, plain on outer side and brushed on the inner side. Ideal warm hoodie fabric!
✅ Detachable mother's hoodAside of the same features as our jacket (2 detachable inserts, detachable mother's collar & baby's hood with collar) it also has a detachable mother's hood.

It contains the tools one uses to transform from a shuffling, scruffy zombie to a well-groomed dynamo. If you’re traveling with others, your kit also speaks to who you are. Starting your day with an attractive, well-packed kit says volumes about what kind of day you intend to have.Your travel accessories should be practical and useful (and this kit is certainly that), but I also think they should be awesome and stand out, too. There are so many useless and overpriced kits out there, and you will love that unlike other kits this one truly has everything you need — most importantly, it will make you smile! Definitely a statement piece.    patent pending.  Where do you tuck your toiletries into when making a short trip across town or a long travel across the country?The guess is, you really don’t know, and we’ll go one better to predict that sometimes you forget some of these important toiletries because they don’t pack themselves.Sometimes, after a little bit of travel your toiletries may become a little roughed up because nobody said you had to pamper them like babies. With Kitatoz, you have a one stop store to turn to for an affordable and already packed luxury toiletry for adults and kids. This will ultimately make that vacation holiday preparation, Gym workout and work trip a tad faster than when you had to go through a chore to find and organize all your toiletries.                Everybody does! It comes in handy if you’re going to be out of your home for a while. So, you’ll need this if you’re going to hit the gym, work late at the hospital, do some camping, night outs at hotels, sleepovers at a friend’s or staying long hours to get your Airbnb booking.People are constantly on the move, travelling from place to place for a bunch of reasons. The best reason I can give you is “that’s what people do naturally”; travel to get what they need wherever they find it. So, travelling to the gym for fitness purposes is not going to stop, travelling to work, school, a new state or country, sleepover nights, and military missions will not stop either. With Kitatoz, you have a one stop store to turn to for an affordable and already packed luxury toiletry for adults and kids.We are determined to change the way you travel , now you don't need to go to stores to buy each item individually and pack them in a messy bag. We have taken care of all this.   We have designed kitatoz with a minimal footprint. Built to last and designed to adapt. At a terrific price point help round out the kit’s approachable charms. We want you to carry more but worry less.   A supremely economic design and easy-to-use construction allow the bag to fit pretty much anywhere. It is one handsome piece of utility that’s really minimal. The interior has convenient slots along the perfect edges for little things that you might need to bring. Unlike other typical kits, bags with just a zipper on top, this one goes nearly all the way around, so you can easily slide in and out — nothing gets in or out. That’s actually what makes it so much more than a Dopp kit.  Kitatoz comes in 3 cases:WHITE , BLACK and CLEAR Case both for men and woman.white case black case clear case Kitatoz is available both in HIS and HER Models.Each is carefully designed to fulfill the basic needs of both genders.  Don’t let the so-called big names fool you — You will get everything you need without the premium price. This is a super durable and handsome, A very power-ful and feature-full kit. Furthermore, it’s an extremely durable kit and all the things you need a travel kit to be!   The best part of all this is that you can have subscriptions for Kitatoz blister and have them shipped to your doorstep. So you don't have to go to store every time.    At Kitatoz we are creating innovative solutions that simplify daily life .We have created the next generation of Luxury Toiletry Kit. We are a team of friends,doctors, engineers, designers, problem solvers, and explorers. We are bound together with one sole purpose in mind: create stuff to simplify and enhance everyday living!  Our product offering is results of solutions that we seek while experiencing the problems with the existing systems around us. We constantly strive to make human experiences better and more fulfilling. Our product is designed to enable people maintain their health and beauty anywhere , anytime .Kitatoz is simple and classic in the sense that you don’t have to overthink it. The result is a perfect, minimalist kit of exceptional quality and genuine distinction.

Informational
portal for tourists and guests
  Have
you ever been on a holiday and been lost? Have you ever been on a holiday at a
new place and only find the best bar in town on your last day?
  My
name is Kamen Nenov and I’m working on a mobile app to guide you around the
biggest holiday resort in Bulgaria, the so called Sunny Beach. Currently I’m
working as property manager here at Sunny Beach. With every new season to start
many new visitors are coming over and those same people are wondering around
trying to find best places for them to visit. 
  Having
an offline mobile app with all the places of interest will make everyone’s
holiday more enjoyable, will make them feel more comfortable around and will
safe them lots of precious time to rest. And this is what holidays are for,
aren’t they?

  We’ll
be extremely thankful if we are able to raise the funds needed to complete the task. So far with my colleagues we have created a web site to go with the app.
It is called www.wayzzguide.com.
Where
we have added all the places that
might be interesting for the guests and visitors. We have invested a lot in this to make the system go and fill up all the places. It came out that creating an up to date and

<h3>Une 2 CV à San Francisco - Etats Unis </h3>
<p> Je m appelle Did Bernard et Rental Vintage est ma petite compagnie de location de voitures vintages Américaines.Je suis Français et nous sommes implantés à San Francisco depuis 2 ans. </p>
<p>Notre projet <u><strong><i>"" Une deuche à San Francisco "" </i></strong></u>est de<strong> faire venir et restaurer une vieille et mythique 2 CV citroen</strong> pour la proposer à la <strong>location</strong>.Notre statut de loueur professionnel nous permet de pouvoir proposer à chaque donateur un <strong>retour sur donation dès sa premiere reservation-location</strong> et ainsi de pouvoir avoir le plaisir de <strong>circuler en Californie</strong> avec la plus emblématique voiture que la France ait jamais connue.</p>
<p>Chez Rental Vintage nous savons <strong>assurer et entretenir un véhicule</strong> pour le <strong>rendre disponible</strong> et fiable <strong>toute l' année.</strong></p>
<p><strong><i>""Une deuche à San Francisco""</i></strong>  en crownfunding c est un clin d'oeil, que dis je un appel de ( vieux) phares, entre notre bonne vieille France des villages et cette Californie de la technologie du futur.</p>
</div><div>
<p>Cette <strong>vieille 2 CV nous la voulons rutilante</strong> et <strong>complètement restaurée.</strong> Nous imaginons un <strong>magnifique logo</strong> et pour ceux qui le souhaite leur nom comme contributeur.Elle doit être très bien entretenue, bien assurée et disponible à l'année.<strong>Chacun pourra l utiliser</strong> en la réservant auprès de Rental vintage, mais vous pourrez aussi la voir circuler régulièrement dans la city, ou sur les routes de la napa Valley par exemple par des Américains épris de notre belle culture.</p>
<p><strong>Notre contrepartie unique</strong> c est <strong>de vous proposer cette voiture</strong> en location avec des <strong>ristournes basées sur votre donation </strong></p>
<p>exemples :</p>
<p>vous contribuez à hauteur de $ 250.Réservez la voiture pour une journée et vous ne paierez rien.</p>
<p>vous contribuez à hauteur de $ 150.Reservez la voiture une journée pour seulement $ 100 </p>
<p>vous contribuez à hauteur de $ 500.reservez la voiture pour un week end et vous ne paierez rien.</p>
<p>Vous souhaitez donner plus ou moins, pas de problème chaque contribution est deductible à partir de $ 100.</p>
<p>Chaque contributeur et quelque soit le montant à partir de $ 20 recevra la carte postale de la voiture restaurée avec son logo et un code pour une réservation rapide.</p>
<p>Pour les français ayant une activité professionnelle dans la baie et voulant utiliser cette voiture en exposition, nous proposons également celle ci, n hésitez pas à nous en parler.</p>
<p>Ce projet ne sera pas sans embuches car nous devons trouver en France celle qui deviendra notre ambassadrice. Il faut la faire venir, la légaliser, la restaurer entièrement, la repeindre, l'assurer et être quotidiennement aux petits soins mais ce projet est magnifiquement motivant.</p>
<p>J ai déja eu une 2 cv en France, une AZAM de 1965 et je connais bien tous les points faible de cette inconditionnelle voiture.Je connais les réseaux pour trouver les pieces et les transitaires fiables pour la faire venir.J'ai déniché ici un mécanicien amoureux de cette voiture à qui je pourrais en confier la restauration.Autant d heures et de reflexions que je me propose de passer, en votre compagnie discrete, car chaque étape vous sera expliquée et commentée par le biais d'une page Facebook et d'un instagram dédié.</p>
<p>Pour ceux qui ne peuvent contribuer financièrement, un simple relais de votre part auprès de gens susceptibles d être intéressés nous serait également précieux, et peut être serez vous aussi un généreux loueur plus tard, alors n hésitez pas à en parler autour de vous.</p>

""Une deuche à San Francisco""  en crownfunding c est un clin d'oeil, que dis je un appel de ( vieux) phares, entre notre bonne vieille France des villages et cette Californie de la technologie du futur.

Cette vieille 2 CV nous la voulons rutilante et complètement restaurée. Nous imaginons un magnifique logo et pour ceux qui le souhaite leur nom comme contributeur.Elle doit être très bien entretenue, bien assurée et disponible à l'année.Chacun pourra l utiliser en la réservant auprès de Rental vintage, mais vous pourrez aussi la voir circuler régulièrement dans la city, ou sur les routes de la napa Valley par exemple par des Américains épris de notre belle culture.
Notre contrepartie unique c est de vous proposer cette voiture en location avec des ristournes basées sur votre donation 
exemples :
vous contribuez à hauteur de $ 250.Réservez la voiture pour une journée et vous ne paierez rien.
vous contribuez à hauteur de $ 150.Reservez la voiture une journée pour seulement $ 100 
vous contribuez à hauteur de $ 500.reservez la voiture pour un week end et vous ne paierez rien.
Vous souhaitez donner plus ou moins, pas de problème chaque contribution est deductible à partir de $ 100.
Chaque contributeur et quelque soit le montant à partir de $ 20 recevra la carte postale de la voiture restaurée avec son logo et un code pour une réservation rapide.
Pour les français ayant une activité professionnelle dans la baie et voulant utiliser cette voiture en exposition, nous proposons également celle ci, n hésitez pas à nous en parler.
Ce projet ne sera pas sans embuches car nous devons trouver en France celle qui deviendra notre ambassadrice. Il faut la faire venir, la légaliser, la restaurer entièrement, la repeindre, l'assurer et être quotidiennement aux petits soins mais ce projet est magnifiquement motivant.
J ai déja eu une 2 cv en France, une AZAM de 1965 et je connais bien tous les points faible de cette inconditionnelle voiture.Je connais les réseaux pour trouver les pieces et les transitaires fiables pour la faire venir.J'ai déniché ici un mécanicien amoureux de cette voiture à qui je pourrais en confier la restauration.Autant d heures et de reflexions que je me propose de passer, en votre compagnie discrete, car chaque étape vous sera expliquée et commentée par le biais d'une page Facebook et d'un instagram dédié.
Pour ceux qui ne peuvent contribuer financièrement, un simple relais de votre part auprès de gens susceptibles d être intéressés nous serait également précieux, et peut être serez vous aussi un généreux loueur plus tard, alors n hésitez pas à en parler autour de vous.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

   The Impact 


India is a country often referred to as the ‘mother of civilizations’, an incredible manifestation of diversity of customs and cultures. Empires, dynasties, traditions and religions of all colours went into making India the land of wonder that it is. And just imagine travellers are unable to see beyond the Taj Mahal or the Humayun Tomb in such a vibrant country. 








That is why we feel there still remains a definite need to explore beyond the boundaries. There lies a need to present and explore this diversity- India’s soul, through centuries and millenniums under a common solution. Yes, we just don’t mean business. Eccentric Travels is more about the love that we have for our country.


A completely untouched, unexplored India lies hidden behind the clichéd India. We intend to bring to the attention of travel enthusiasts such destinations in India and promote ecotourism in those places.


Travel isn’t just reaching a destination. There is a lot more waiting behind closed doors. We hope to open those doors for travellers coming to India. The articles featured on our guide are written bringing to the front the history, culture, people, attractions, archaeology, alleys, shop, food, lanes, traditions, hues and the very length, breath and heart of India. 





We aim to present the service providers in the Indian travel industry in a better and more educated fashion through finely weaved reviews. These reviews intend to bring out the good and the best of a place, eateries, stays, shops so as to help travellers plan their trip 



Risks & Challenges Our biggest challenge is technology development since we are all from a non technical background.


But we are passionate to overcome all hurdles and obstacles, and we think we have accomplished our aim to an extent by creating a basic travel guide. We now need creative brains to help us execute features which we have planned.

We are definitely looking for monetary help, but we heartily welcome and appreciate any help you can lend us. 

We value your help with suggestions, sharing our idea on social media to help us get more audience and in any way you find suitable or want to contribute. 


Become our voice and inform people who are interested in travelling to India about our initiative, this would help them too as they won't end up thinking they know India after only visiting the Taj Mahal.

We did just that with our patented Windcatcher® valve. Since 2013, our AirPads have been the go to gear for anyone seeking a rapidly inflating place to rest. After our success on Shark Tank™ in 2015, we have spent the past 3 years designing and prototyping many versions of the next AirPad we wanted to release. We listened to all of our supporter's feedback and.........The result: The Fastest Inflating, the Lightest Weight, and the Largest Windcatcher® AirPad we've ever designed. We've even added Insulation to make this a year round AirPad.  

 
 How The ""Magic"" Happens 

 
Our patented Windcatcher® valve uses the simple principle of entrainment to amplify your own breath; thus inflating the Ultra AirPad much faster than conventional valves.When you blow into the Windcatcher® valve you create a stream of fast moving, low pressure air. The surrounding air has a higher pressure and is sucked into the low pressure air stream. As a result, the air entering the Windcatcher® valve is 5 times greater than the air you expelled from your lungs. Some people will find the Windcatcher® valve to be easy and will have no issues inflating the Ultra AirPad; others may require a few extra breaths and a little bit of practice.  Windcatcher® Ultra AirPad​ Specs
Inflated size:  74"" (187.96 cm) x 25.5"" (64.77 cm) x 2.5"" (6.35 cm).
Rolled up size:  10"" (26.67 cm) x 3.5"" (8.89 cm).
Weight:  1 lb 9 oz (0.7 kilograms or 700 grams).
Primaloft® Insulation:  Aids in retaining body heat on cooler nights.
Material:  Lightweight polyester material laminated with TPU (Very durable and healthier than PVC).
Color: The Ultra AirPad will first be available in our NEW Windcatcher® Green. If we reach $100,000 in funding we will produce the Windcatcher® Blue Ultra AirPad or the Black Ultra AirPad. After we hit our goal, we will send out a survey with the colors to choose from. The winning color choice will be made available to our fans.      Features
G-hook Fastener:  Quickly and easily open and close the Windcatcher® valve. 
Insulation:  Makes sleeping a bit warmer for those cooler nights.
Horizontal baffles:  Means it is very comfortable!!
No Stuff Sack Required:  The built-in elastic band attaches to the G-hook, allowing you to pack up the Windcatcher® Ultra AirPad without the need for a stuff sack.
Sanitary:  The valve never touches your mouth.
Quiet:  NO loud & obnoxious electric pumping noise.
Requires NO Power
Requires NO Pumping
Other mats and air pads are such a hassle to inflate and pack-up, they aren't practical to use for just an hour or less. However, the Windcatcher® Ultra AirPad inflates and also packs-up so quickly, it's perfect for every occasion! 5X FASTER INFLATION, WITHOUT PUMPING OR POWER Each time you blow into the Windcatcher® valve, your breath is amplified FIVE times, pulling in more of the surrounding air to expedite the inflation process. This far surpasses airpads with a small conventional valve; saving you countless headaches and wasted breaths.And if that wasn't enough, we have designed and constructed the Ultra AirPad from some of the lightest and most durable material we could source. Our baffled design is Ultra comfortable and Ultra sleek!  The Ultra AirPad packs up small and can be taken anywhere you go.  EFFORTLESS DEFLATION AND PACK-UP   The large Windcatcher® valve allows for near instant deflation, letting you pack-up with ease and efficiency. NO WAITING, NO HASSLE. Where You've Seen Windcatcher®: Windcatcher® Founder, Ryan Frayne,on Shark Tank™  What's Been Said About Us: Windcatcher® Ultra AirPad Goals:  The Windcatcher® AirPillowIf we reach our goal of $150,000 we will be able to begin manufacturing our very own Windcatcher® AirPillow.

The Periscopic Mask - is an upgrade from the wide variety of existing leisure full-face masks to a new class device of adventure, sport, and rescue. Sea Voice Inc. made two dozen modifications for this upgrade.The Periscopic Mask - is the safest full face snorkeling mask in the World that brings into the water a personal periscope and adapter to a mini air tank. Comparison of modifications of the Periscopic Mask from Sea Voice Inc. with the types of the existing masks:PERISCOPEYou should know where you are when you are moving at high speed,or swim in a group, near a pontoon/boat/rocks.We shifted the tube to the left and inserted two mirrors - in the top of the tube and on the glass inside the mask above the left eye. In the Periscopic Mask, the snorkeler in the water can see what is above the water. MAXIMIZED SAFETY We made more than a dozen modifications to fix the safety errors that are in ALL other masks created before the Periscopic Mask.With new type air membrane, we achieved a reduction in the level of CO2 consumption by 30-50% as compared to any full-face snorkeling mask.Increased air ducts, air duct openings, and maximum-direct air flow allow you to breathe freely even when you are actively moving.Manual blocking of the float (in addition to the standard) allows you to roll upside down and tumble in the water without filling the mask with water.The new latch allows you to conveniently fasten the mask, regardless of hairstyle and shape/size of the head, as well as quickly remove the mask if necessary.Increased buoyancy will protect not experienced, tired swimmers and will help not to drown in a storm.The spherical shape of glass distributes the water pressure much better than masks with corner joints and planes.SPEED & DIVING ACCESSORIESThe Periscopic Mask has an adapter for attaching a mini air-tank of other manufacturers. You can use it when the SCUBA is not available or not applicable.CAUTION Using compressed air underwater requires special training (PADI and others), untrained divers can cause serious harm to their health - the air-tank adapter should not be used by untrained divers.Adapters for snorkeling tubes for connecting a mini air-tank have been on the open market for several years, and are even approved by the army. We created the first such adapter for a full face mask.Using a periscopic mask with a balloon makes it easy to sail at speeds near the surface.Using a mini air-tank, you can dive to a depth up to 33 feet (10 meters) for up to 5 minutes (with an average inhalation volume of 1.5 liters).Adapter connector design allows you to replace the tank without lifting your head out of the waterOur cuffs allow you to carry up to 4 mini air-tank (two on the shoulders and two on the hips)Special strip for blowing nose is designed to equalize the pressure in the skull with increasing depthAnd automatic float switching of the air source from clean to compressed (and vice versa) saves air in the tank and allows using the Periscopic Mask as a rescue device in a storm.Trained divers can use our Periscopic Mask with a mini air-tank of other manufacturers for short-term work and entertainment at minor depths. DESIGN PROCESSWe created a full-face mask that would become a really safe mask of this type, with corrected engineering errors of the past, with simultaneous use of different mask nodes for several functions, and for symbiosis with related types of activity.

He started to wonder whether it was even worth buying another adjustable set. Changing lengths for different scenarios provided huge advantages but was too slow, broke up the flow and often wasn't worth the effort. Not to mention how fragile existing adjustable poles can be. This conclusion is what, later that year, gave rise to the idea behind the ATP-01. A pole that could be adjusted at the press of a button on the handle, designed to maximise utility and strength while removing all dead weight.</p><p> </p><p>After researching the available products it was apparent that the alpine pole industry as a whole was lacking. Year on year releasing the same unrefined products with small changes and gimmicks. Often an afterthought from ski-centric brands. There was no saving the existing designs, the pole needed to be redesigned from scratch.</p><p> </p><p>And so MONT.BLACK was born, a UK-based alpine equipment manufacturer, driven by mechanical engineering expertise and a passion for outdoor sports. It seemed clear to us that more focus needed to be put on utilising recent technological advancements and precision engineering. Allowing us to produce higher quality products that better meet your needs. So that's what we decided to do.</p><p> </p><p>Since then, our initial design solution has been continuously refined and developed iteration after iteration, prototype after prototype, for 4 years, until we felt we had truly created the perfect solution to bring to market.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s4.gifyu.com/images/20.-Workshop.gif"" src=""""/> </p><p> </p><h2>So why Indiegogo?</h2><ul>

They have some major flaws: they take too long to adjust, they're easily broken and often cumbersome. Whether it's avoiding buying them or simply not bothering to adjust them, these problems result in a product/feature with huge benefits going largely underutilised. We fixed that and more.   We spent the last 4 years applying our background in mechanical engineering to redesign the adjustable pole from the ground up, minimising weight and cost, while maximising utility and reliability.  Ensuring every part was thoroughly tested and built to exceed international standards.   Our goal was to improve your experience on all terrain. Giving you the perfect length poles at all times. Helping you finally get the most out of adjustable poles.      Incredibly satisfying to use. Even when designing these poles we couldn't have begun to imagine how satisfying they would be to use. Changing lengths instantly at the press of a button and hearing that *click* of the pins locking into place. Flowing from one terrain to another.  You simply press the button, change the length and release the button as you pass the desired hole. The spring loaded pins do the rest.     How we like to use them.When we asked our lovely followers how they liked to use adjustable poles, we found that (as you'd expect) most people use them to adapt to varying gradients and terrains. Some use them for growing children and some even use them for tent poles. But you haven't lived until you've poled along the flat with poles set to 140cm. A level of efficiency hitherto unseen. You'll never arrive at the bottom of a lift, after a long flat, close to blacking out ever again.Oh that doesn't happen to you? Just us? Okay, cool.      Strong. Simple. ReliableDuring the development process for the ATP-01 we toyed with many different features. We even made a prototype that could be split into three pieces, for compactness. However, we decided this was exactly the kind of design we were trying to get away from. Too many failure points and lots of added weight. We wanted to incorporate our new feature effectively while producing a robust and reliable pole. We think we nailed it. Change lengths precisely and instantly without thought.  It’s instantly secure And won’t be accidentally released.   The features you're used to.While we didn't want to overload the ATP-01 with gimmicks that would potentially reduce its reliability we still wanted to keep the creature comforts that we've all grown used to.         ATP-01 Materials, Specs + OptionsWhen designing our take on the adjustable pole we weren't willing to compromise compared to the products currently available. We pushed to achieved a strong, light, affordable product while still adding our new feature.   Colour Options: Seperation Option:The ATP-01 is designed with a limiter to stop the poles from separating when performing the extension shown below. However, this limiter also means the poles cannot be separated at all, even for travel. Therefore, we recommend that if you desire compactness over this one functionality, that you opt to have the limiter removed when selecting your perk. The adjustability still works exactly the same, but if you attempted the below manoeuvre, you'd leave two pole segments behind.       Rest easy, we've got you covered.At MONT.BLACK we aim to produce products that you will use for years to come. To this end, we offer a 2 year warranty with all of our products. However, this is not a typical warranty.In a bid to be more sustainable, the ATP-01 was designed to allow for all parts to be replaceable. If your product breaks during the warranty period we will be more than happy to repair it, or send you the replacement parts to do it yourself. If it's not possible to repair, the pole will then be recycled and you will be provided with a brand new one. This means less poles in the landfill and more fun outdoors.We don't want to leave our customers high and dry regardless of the warranty. If a part fails after the warranty period simply contact us and we will find you replacement parts using what is left over from that production run. Unfortunately we cannot offer this post warranty service for the aluminium sections themselves.     Convinced? Choose from the perks below, scroll to the top of the page, then click Back It.Or if you're not bored of us yet, scroll past for more details on us, our product testing and the estimated delivery timeline.  We didn't want to be the type of company that pushed our own views on our customers. However, the current climate situation is at a tipping point and something needs to be done. In aid of this, we are pledging to offset 115% of our total carbon emissions, starting by planting a tree for every single pledge we receive. This is something that really matters to us and we hope you'll help out  by supporting our campaign.     As part of our on-going efforts to operate as a responsible climate positive company and reduce plastic waste, we made the decision not to supply rubber feet and baskets as standard with the ATP-01. This is not in an effort to make an extra quid and if Indiegogo allowed us to list them for less than a £1 we would. We simply want to let you make the decision yourself. As with most Indiegogos we will be dispatching the ATP-01 in batches starting with our super early bird backers. If you're in a particular rush to get your pole, we recommend you select the ""BLANK POLE"" option. This will enable us to assemble and dispatch your pole roughly a month early (depending on batch size) before it goes through the printing process.      The story behind MONT.BLACK MONT.BLACK's journey began back in 2017 when founder Dom Box broke his adjustable ski pole while trying to stand back up after a fall (he swears it wasn't a tantrum but no one saw, so...). He started to wonder whether it was even worth buying another adjustable set. Changing lengths for different scenarios provided huge advantages but was too slow, broke up the flow and often wasn't worth the effort. Not to mention how fragile existing adjustable poles can be. This conclusion is what, later that year, gave rise to the idea behind the ATP-01. A pole that could be adjusted at the press of a button on the handle, designed to maximise utility and strength while removing all dead weight. After researching the available products it was apparent that the alpine pole industry as a whole was lacking. Year on year releasing the same unrefined products with small changes and gimmicks. Often an afterthought from ski-centric brands. There was no saving the existing designs, the pole needed to be redesigned from scratch. And so MONT.BLACK was born, a UK-based alpine equipment manufacturer, driven by mechanical engineering expertise and a passion for outdoor sports. It seemed clear to us that more focus needed to be put on utilising recent technological advancements and precision engineering. Allowing us to produce higher quality products that better meet your needs. So that's what we decided to do. Since then, our initial design solution has been continuously refined and developed iteration after iteration, prototype after prototype, for 4 years, until we felt we had truly created the perfect solution to bring to market.   So why Indiegogo?
Fundamentally, Indiegogo provides creators with a brilliant pre-order process and an extended lead time – which in turn allows us to produce at scale (bringing prices down), and gauge demand (reducing waste). 
It enables us to grow and continue working without having to seek venture capital. This means we can take on the more innovative products that bigger companies might avoid, without having to worry about revenue targets set by others.
Using Indiegogo allows us to reward our earliest supporters with the lowest prices as a thank you for believing in us. It also lets us connect better with our customers helping us to steer our products in the directions you actually want.
      What sets us apart.A quick rant: MONT.BLACK was born from the belief that the products currently available to consumers are unimaginative and poorly engineered. We aimed to change this, producing more reliable innovations by using precision engineering and cutting edge technologies in our design process. Material SelectionWe utilise smart material selection programmes to refine our pole geometry. Once calibrated the system automatically optimises parameters such as wall thickness, pole overlap and material, helping find the perfect balance of light, cheap and strong. This method in particular led us to a new geometry which, when compared to current products, allows us to bring the weight of the pole itself down while still adding strength. Metal 3D PrintingRecent improvements in industrial scale metal 3D printing have meant that small parts that would have previously been too intricate to produce can now be made quickly and easily at low cost. In the ATP-01 we use this for our smaller internal parts. Strength Analysis + TestingIf you pick up your current poles, you'll likely see in small text ""not according to ISO 7331"" meaning they haven't met the international standards set for alpine poles. We weren't willing to settle for that with the ATP-01. Further analysis programmes and real world tests helped simulate the poles use over a lifetime, helping us walk the line between lightweight and robust, while remaining reliable in the long run.             An idea of what to expect.If all goes to plan, we will have finished shipping the ATP-01 out to all levels of backer by the end of December this year, in-time for the majority of the 2021-22 season.

Not the first we ever made, but the first one we made for ourselves as a new brand.-INTRODUCING KUNWU ORIONORION is a product of passion and love for folding knives, made by a couple of knife fanatics that have deep roots in knife making industry and deep understanding of what high quality folding knife should be, how it needs to perform and what boxes it needs to tick in order to be used daily, performing as a perfect EDC tool. Knives are tools after all, but tools with a soul.We poured all of our knowledge and love for knife making into one knife that we are happy to present to you. We had two things on our minds, stellar Quality and Affordability. Mid-tech knives that involve a lot of hand finishing and human interaction in the process of making do not need to cost as much as a second hand car, regardless of the country of origin.Our ORION as a firstborn and first one to come out of our shop rides on high expectations but not without reason.We played on Crucible’s s35vn and titanium that has been machined to perfection in order to give you the superior knife with featherweight feel and sturdy construction that will not let you down in prolonged use, or even, dare I say knife abuse. We build knives that last, we build knives that have the potential to be inherited, passed down or up with pride.Watch out for KUNWU in future, ORION being our first for a ridiculous price that will blow your mind.-KUNWU ORION, HIGH END KNIFE, SUPERIOR MATERIALS AND FLAWLESS EXECUTION! -About Our Prices: SPECS for KUNWU ORION easily make it a 200 USD dollar knife in retailWe are offering it for 99~128 USD with FREE international shipping.The price alone is worth the risk, especially where there is none involved.Knives that use similar materials and production technology and process are easily 3xmore expensive, but the process for ORION is even more delicate and complete as we were making it with perfection in mind and execution. Milled out titanium scales, hand sharpened blade and countless hours spent inspecting the first batch we made. For us at KUNWU the ORION knife is a go big or go home type of gambling situation -So what’s our deal, who is KUNWU?Kunwu Knives came to life in May 2019, when a bunch of people got together and decided that it is the right time to make a knife brand that can fill a gap in folding knives market that has become saturated with lame ideas and repetitive solutions, we were siting and discussing knives, brands and being in the center of knife making industry in Yangjiang China, knowing all the brands that are being produced in our neighborhood, knowing all the ins and outs of the industry, we were wondering, knowing all the processes and all the technology, whether we could make a superior product that costs less. Guess what? Yes, we could, and it made perfect sense for us to start our own story from scratch with some fresh ideas, fresh people internationally. We wanted something “multidimensional”, a knife company with a backbone and risk taking ability that either pays of or sends us back to square one.-WHY IS KUNWU ORION SO SPECIAL?1. Insane PRICE to Quality RATIO!Making a knife special can come out of two things, one is emotion other being the quality.We have the quality part set, actually it’s pretty much a perfect knife for a first timer. You just can’t go wrong with our heat treatment of s35vn and Titanium we used to make a decent size ultra-high quality folding knife.Emotional response part of the knife is a tricky bastard to tackle but we did it anyways.First of all, you don’t want to feel ripped of ad deprived of your hard earned cash.Second you want to enjoy the knife for what it is.So the first problematic part we got sorted as well, there is no better knife for the price anywhere in the world.No Cold Steel, Spyderco ZT or any Sinkevich can come close to the price to quality ratio.You will not feel ripped off, actually you will be amazed that you managed to spend so little and get so much. You will suspect we use cheap labor and work from shop in godforbidwill in Chinese back-country, but no man, Yangjiang is modern coastal Chinese city with the biggest knife-making industry in the world.Our competitors are our next door neighbors, and believe me the competition is stiff, raising the bar each day, not year.Think of cold war arms race. We outclass each other on daily basis so that you guys can live in an era where good knives are being made daily.2. Real s35vn, Crucible Industries Super Star Super Steel with adequate Heat Treatment!Having a knife in s35vn is a no biggie these days, having that same steel heat treated the way it supposed to be heat treated is a rare beast. Most of the companies claim that softer or less HRC blades are more user friendly.We said, screw that and brought up that marvelous powdered steel to super hard levels without affecting lateral strength of the blade. I’d rather have those Rockwells high than having s35vn deflecting its purpose of being a good carbide distributed steel with an amazing edge holding ability. If you’re novice at sharpening stuff, s35vn will not be harder than 440c to sharpen but it will hold and edge forever.It’s a tough steel that can take a lot of abuse and has zero chance of getting corrosion anywhere. It really matters not if the blade is stamped s35vn if that steel has been mistreated in the process. So no cheap marketing trick of just using the damn thing to attract people, we just made it right for the knife people to use and love.3.Milled Titanium Body Super Lightweight Framelock.Lightest Folder on the market!So we thought to ourselves, how can we make this thing even better.So what’s better than shedding some weight without losing the structural composition and strength.Our Inspiration came from Shimano XTR rear derailleur. We have some MTB nutters in the team that are always looking to save some grams on their bikes. XT, XTR SRAM xx1, besides being perfectly functioning pieces of biking equipment all have that trait of obsession with weight.So we thought OK, we’re gonna do the same and see where that leads us in knife making. Looking around the knife, few obvious choices popped to mind. Let’s put in on low titanium diet and mill out the excess titanium from the scales and add some g10 for good looks. Our knife is the lightest full titanium framelock folder on the market. Period! We added the stainless steel insert on the lock itself to prolong the lock life and extend it beyond the time that usually takes regular frame-locks to reach their end of the life.--Titanium Handle--Carbon Fiber Pivot Insert4.Prolonged life of the blade, Edge And Hand Sharpening on Japanese Stones.Nothing can ruin a perfectly good knife like a burnt edge. In order to skip that unfortunate turn of events, we decided to use Japanese NANIWA sharpening stones all the way up to 2000 grit. We wanted to keep our edge abrasive enough to catch on materials rather than slip of from them. Perfect almost mirror polished edge can be achieved up to 2000 grit, anything above that is users choice but not really good for everyday use as the edge is not as effective in cutting fibrous materials, which as a matter of fact are basically the stuff your most likely to cut during the day. We always have the real life use scenarios in mind when creating our knives. One thing that we wanted to do with our blade shape, being that it is a drop point and that it matches perfectly with our shallow hollow ground angles, we extended the zero line right behind the edge. Angles are kept at neat 17 degrees for edge stability but the edge itself can be sharpened quite a few times before the blade needs re-profiling thanks to real estate kept at same thickness behind the apex of the edge itself. We effectively extended the sharpening life of the blade by making our hollow grind almost concave in relation to the apex of the edge.-KUNWU ORION SPECIFICATIONS --Package  --Comments from other platform of Orion previous campaign  -Final Words...What sets us apart from gazillions of other brands?Reinventing the same thing over and over again is a bit tedious but in the end there is only so much that you can do to better the knife.

We don't make compromises to bolster the bottom line. We build heirloom quality knives and charge a fair price for tools that are guaranteed to last a lifetime.</p><p> </p><h2>How We Got Here</h2><p>The Reiff Knives F Series grew from roots that are firmly planted in the outdoors. Adventuring in the West Virginia wilderness from a young age, my brother and I gained a deep appreciation for functional, reliable outdoor tools. That appreciation for good tools soon evolved into a passion for knives.</p><p>Frustrated by the limited number of readily available, premium knife options in the market, we got to work designing and building knives that we wanted to own ourselves. This project is about bringing those knives to you.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1626984284/svm03hneciqbssez24ym.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h2> </h2><h2>Our Philosophy</h2><p>When you're heading into the woods, your knife is arguably the most important piece of equipment in your kit. It needs to be up for any challenge the wilderness can throw at it.</p><p>It only takes one afterthought to render a knife unusable. We've taken the time and put in the work to ensure that our knives don't just look great, but that they work great. We prioritize function in every form to make sure our knives are the most effective tools you'll own.</p><p>Our designs are practical. Every feature serves a purpose. We pour ourselves into what is necessary and eliminate what's unnecessary to make your knife as functional as it can be.</p><p>We're building uncompromising tools for uncompromising people. That's the Reiff Knives standard.</p><p> </p><h2>Guaranteed for Life</h2><p>We stand behind our products. Reiff Knives are heirloom quality tools and should last a lifetime. If your knife is defective or suffers catastrophic failure during use, we will repair or replace it at no cost to you.</p><p>This warranty is fully transferable and does not expire. No warranty registrations or receipts are necessary to initiate or validate a warranty claim.</p><p> </p><h2>Sheath Options</h2><p>We offer sheath options in black kydex and brown leather.

However, we've worked tirelessly over the past year and a half to reduce those risks and challenges wherever possible. Here are the risks as we see them: </p><p>1. We've chosen to partner with and experienced American knife producer to build our knives. Our partner has been operating and building quality knives for their own brand and other knife companies for more than ten years and have been producing knives for far longer than that at other well known knife manufacturers. We chose to partner with this manufacturer because their quality has proven to be second to none.</p><p>2. We are sourcing our materials from American suppliers and manufacturers. Having a domestic supply chain significantly reduces the risk of a supply chain breakdown. Our knife steels are made by Crucible Industries in New York. Crucible industries has been on the cutting edge of knife steel development and distribution for many years. Most of you probably already own at least one knife made from Crucible Industries steel.  Even our G10 and hardware are sourced from established American manufacturers and suppliers. </p><p>3. We feel that we've given ourselves plenty of time to fulfill your orders as predicted. </p><p>4. We have prototyped and thoroughly tested these knives in the field.

Comfortable in the hand and easy to clean and maintain. Torx Stainless Steel Hardware - Excellent corrosion resistance and durability. Less susceptible to stripping out. PrototypingWith many knives, the comfort of the handle seems to be an afterthought. In developing these knives, we took a different approach. During the design of the F4 and F6, 3D printing was leveraged to rapid prototype over 40 handle variations until the handle was just right. That's more than 160 hours of just 3D printing prototypes. All along the way, expert field testers were involved in providing feedback on the prototypes to maximize comfort and versatility. It took a long time, but it was worth it. TestingAfter perfecting the 3D printed models, we built 54 working prototypes, and sent them to product testers all over the world. These knives were tested and validated under hard use conditions in the field prior to launching.   The F4 Bushcraft Knife The F4 is a general-purpose bushcraft style knife. Its 4"" blade has a robust spine to withstand hard use applications, with a refined edge geometry to breeze through any bushcraft task. Constructed from 5/32"" thick CPM®3V high-alloy steel, these knives are exceptionally durable. The spine will strike a ferro rod or scrape cedar bark for tinder. The sturdy full tang is skeletonized to reduce the overall weight of the knife, making the F4 an ideal carry companion in the field or around town. You'll find the ergonomic 5"" handle has no hotspots, providing a seamless interface between your hand and the tool. Whether you're crafting a bow drill or field dressing an elk, the F4 will get the job done right.  F4 Specs:Overall Length: 9""Blade Length: 4""Cutting Edge: 3.8""Blade Width: 1.11""Blade Thickness: 5/32"" or .15625Blade Material: CPM 3V®Hardness: 58-60 HRCBlade Style: Drop PointEdge Type: ConvexBlade Grind: Saber GrindFinish: Acid StonewashHandle Length: 5""Handle Width: 1.1""Handle Thickness: .95""Handle Material: G10Weight: 8.2 ozKnife Type: Fixed BladeCountry of Origin: USABest Use: Bushcraft, Hunting, Survival, Camping  The F6 Leuku Knife The F6 Leuku Knife is our modern take on the classic Scandinavian leuku knife design. The 6"" blade is 3/16"" thick and made from CPM®3V high alloy steel, making it exceptionally durable for hard use applications around camp. This blade has good weight and balance making it ideal for tasks ranging from light chopping to field dressing dinner. At 5.25"" long, the handle provides the user with many comfortable grip options. If you're heading out into the wilderness and only bringing one knife, this would be a great option. The F6 is a worthy jack of all trades.  F6 Specs:Overall Length: 11.25""Blade Length: 6""Cutting Edge: 5.75""Blade Width: 1.47""Blade Thickness: 3/16"" or .1875""Blade Material: CPM 3V®Hardness: 58-60 HRCBlade Style: Drop PointEdge Type: ConvexBlade Grind: Saber GrindFinish: Acid StonewashHandle Length: 5.25""Handle Width: 1.16""Handle Thickness: .95""Handle Material: G10Weight: 12.9 ozKnife Type: Fixed BladeCountry of Origin: USABest Use: Bushcraft, Hunting, Survival, CampingThe F6 Leuku Knife in Hand  Who We AreReiff Knives is a family owned and operated, American knife and tool company founded by two brothers, Stu and Ben Shank. We're sourcing high quality materials from American suppliers and building our products in American shops. We know we have a responsibility to the people who buy our tools. We don't make compromises to bolster the bottom line. We build heirloom quality knives and charge a fair price for tools that are guaranteed to last a lifetime. How We Got HereThe Reiff Knives F Series grew from roots that are firmly planted in the outdoors. Adventuring in the West Virginia wilderness from a young age, my brother and I gained a deep appreciation for functional, reliable outdoor tools. That appreciation for good tools soon evolved into a passion for knives.Frustrated by the limited number of readily available, premium knife options in the market, we got to work designing and building knives that we wanted to own ourselves. This project is about bringing those knives to you.  Our PhilosophyWhen you're heading into the woods, your knife is arguably the most important piece of equipment in your kit. It needs to be up for any challenge the wilderness can throw at it.It only takes one afterthought to render a knife unusable. We've taken the time and put in the work to ensure that our knives don't just look great, but that they work great. We prioritize function in every form to make sure our knives are the most effective tools you'll own.Our designs are practical. Every feature serves a purpose. We pour ourselves into what is necessary and eliminate what's unnecessary to make your knife as functional as it can be.We're building uncompromising tools for uncompromising people. That's the Reiff Knives standard. Guaranteed for LifeWe stand behind our products. Reiff Knives are heirloom quality tools and should last a lifetime. If your knife is defective or suffers catastrophic failure during use, we will repair or replace it at no cost to you.This warranty is fully transferable and does not expire. No warranty registrations or receipts are necessary to initiate or validate a warranty claim. Sheath OptionsWe offer sheath options in black kydex and brown leather. You will be contacted after the campaign to choose a right or left-handed setup.  Option 1:Black kydex, taco style sheath, featuring a rotatable belt clip and removable ferro rod loop. Compatible with most aftermarket carry systems.   Option 2:Brown leather, taco style sheath, featuring a dangler and ferro rod loop. Risks & ChallengesThere can be unforeseen risks and challenges with any project. However, we've worked tirelessly over the past year and a half to reduce those risks and challenges wherever possible. Here are the risks as we see them: 1. We've chosen to partner with and experienced American knife producer to build our knives. Our partner has been operating and building quality knives for their own brand and other knife companies for more than ten years and have been producing knives for far longer than that at other well known knife manufacturers. We chose to partner with this manufacturer because their quality has proven to be second to none.2. We are sourcing our materials from American suppliers and manufacturers. Having a domestic supply chain significantly reduces the risk of a supply chain breakdown. Our knife steels are made by Crucible Industries in New York. Crucible industries has been on the cutting edge of knife steel development and distribution for many years. Most of you probably already own at least one knife made from Crucible Industries steel.  Even our G10 and hardware are sourced from established American manufacturers and suppliers. 3. We feel that we've given ourselves plenty of time to fulfill your orders as predicted. 4. We have prototyped and thoroughly tested these knives in the field. We know our manufacturing process works and provides consistent, high-quality results. You'll know what to expect every time you invest in a product from Reiff Knives. Timeline Order Materials - August 2021Begin Production - September 2021Fulfillment - December 2021- January 2022",20.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi, guys.I’m Yolanda,  I’v been spending 2 years to create 7 awesome travel bags.When I was a college student, I started selling some small items on Ebay to earn some pocket money. Since then my 7 years business career has began. With more and more sellers joined Ebay, I felt fierce competition and realized that I didn’t want to sell those stuff anymore. I want to build my own brand.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567930796/s8ns2vbxqsdmebscnmds.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>As a travel and photography enthusiast,I'm travel a lot and I believe safety is of the utmost importance when traveling aboard, whether for backpackers or their belongings.So I decide to create a wonderful backpack which will protect both myself and my belongings.</p>
<p>I like to ride in different countries and travel outdoor,so I created an unique LED solar power bank with safe indicator light which include left-hand turn,right-hand turn,speed reduction and 3 styles camping lamp,strong, soft and SOS,with the power bank I would never worry about dead battery and stay safety at night. To protect my stuff I designed a anti-theft chain and GPS tracker and used the most innovative anti-cutting material. </p>
<p>I like the wireless cellphone charging pocket on shoulder strap very much because it super convenient ,not only free my hands but also never worry about the phone be stolen.</p>

<p>At first, I thought I just need to design a bag by drawing a picture by using Photoshop on my computer. Then just simply find a factory pay them some money and they could have produced the exact same bag I designed. However, after the tenth factory’s master told me that they could not do what I wanted. I was finally aware that making the wonderful backpack is actually not that easy! The bags I designed are too advanced and complicated. There was no big factory willing to spend such a long time to make samples without any  real production order. And other small factories were unable to make perfect samples.</p>

<p>So I started to make the bags by myself. I bought four different sewing machines and started making the bags in my bedroom. It was the first time I sewed bags which i had never done before and there was no teacher. My only belief is that “nothing impossible” &amp; “I can do it!”!! Then miracle happened (emm... at least , my Mum thought it’s a miracle because she couldn’t believe her ignorant daughter had made all those complicated bag all by herself ). </p>

<p>After 3 months and hundreds of attempts, I succeeded. I did lots of research about different materials and finally picked the world best anti-cutting material. I tried more than 20 times to rebuild them and make sure they are good enough to make a beautiful backpack. Every detail of the bag had been modified more than 3 times to make sure every detail is thoughtful. Oh! I even made over 10 different straps to make sure they’re comfortable, good-looking and able to charging wirelessly , oh my...</p>

Every year, travellers book their tour packages for the dream vacation but they ended up paying more than necessary. For any tour packages they booked, they could have purchased similar tour packages from another tour agency at a cheaper price. Such price inefficiencies happen because it's very time consuming for travellers to search and compare the prices from every single tour agency website.

Imagine a single comparison website whereby travellers can search for their ideal destination, the number of days and instantly, they can see the all the prices from the tour agencies. They can then easily compare each deal for them to make a better choice.
This is what we have in mind - to create an effective comparison website that aims to address the inefficiencies in price discovery in the travel industry.






What We Need 
 We have done our research and engaged some web designers to provide some ball-park estimates for developing the entire website.  The estimates range from USD 100,000 to 250,000.
We feel that we should pay at least 50% of the development costs using our own money (This is to walk our talk).  Hence, we need to raise funding for the remaining 50%, which is around USD 50,000.   The Rewards For backers who contributed $10 (or more), upon successful campaign with the target goal reached, one of the backers would be randomly picked to win the Applet Watch (Sports Edition).
Other Ways You Can Help Us



If you can't contribute with money, no sweat!  There are still a few great ways you can really help us make this project a reality:

<h3>Paradise One Microfibre Sun Lounger Towel</h3>
<p>So a couple of years ago I was on holiday with my family and when I came out of the pool, I burnt myself on the matt on the sun lounger because my pool towel was not big enough to cover the whole surface of the sun lounger. So Initially I thought wouldn't it be great to have a towel that covered the whole sun lounger so I could not worry about my legs or arms burning on the sun lounger.</p>
<p>Then I noticed a towel with pockets which I though would be a cool addition to the towel because it makes the towel convenient to use and gives you a place for your sun cream or other essential pool side items.</p>

So a couple of years ago I was on holiday with my family and when I came out of the pool, I burnt myself on the matt on the sun lounger because my pool towel was not big enough to cover the whole surface of the sun lounger. So Initially I thought wouldn't it be great to have a towel that covered the whole sun lounger so I could not worry about my legs or arms burning on the sun lounger.
Then I noticed a towel with pockets which I though would be a cool addition to the towel because it makes the towel convenient to use and gives you a place for your sun cream or other essential pool side items.
The final obstacle I had was what can make this towel differentiate from its competitors. so after research on the material I found something which would make this towel compact, quick drying and absorbent.

Starving to feed your body on the wholesome dishes and your soul on the fascinating time with your friends next to the fire.But the fire won’t start.

<h2>Essential for travel</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Why is <strong>SafeT+</strong> essential for traveling? </p>
<p>1. The <strong>CO detector</strong>. Most hotels, condos, apartments, and other residences have a smoke detector. However, very few have a CO detector. By now you have probably heard the report of the family that died in their sleep on vacation due to CO poisoning. What you probably do not know is that this is not a rare occurrence. In the US alone, 20,000 people are treated each year for CO poisoning. An early alert CO detector is essential to prevent sickness and even death.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/wu2h0fLqDrg?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<p>2. The <strong>LED lantern</strong>. If you have ever been in a hotel during a power outage, you know how dark the rooms can get. And, if you have ever gone to a hotel bathroom in a blackout, which is almost always interior with no windows, you know the meaning of complete and utter darkness. This is why it is vital to have a light with you at all times. </p>
<p>3. The <b>Security camera</b>. With all the new options for vacation accommodations available today, it is more important than ever to be vigilant about security. Vacation swaps, rentals by owner, and AirBNB are great alternatives to traditional hotels and resorts, but the same security measures are not used in these places. Keys are passed from person to person. On site security is not present in most situations. Owners are not vetted. For these reasons, a security camera is a must to ensure that no one is in your vacation rental while you are not.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/1hQo02R2JGY?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Together, these features provide security and peace of mind, both while you are at and away from your vacation accommodations. </p>
<h2>Some Vacation Uses:</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540328565/zzwssozolprvko1rvd7y.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h2>Other Suggested Uses:  </h2>
<p><strong>Dorms and student housing</strong>. On campus or off, student housing should be kept to a high standard. Sadly this is not always the case. <strong>Poor maintenance</strong> and <strong>old appliances</strong> and fixtures can be very <strong>dangerous</strong>. When your child sets off for college, <strong>CO poisoning</strong> should not be on the list of things you need to worry about.</p>
</div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540328821/xh7n03vdyiomdj0tptnv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Garage</strong>. Did you know that a running car can cause <strong>CO levels</strong> to rise above <strong>100 ppm in minutes</strong>, even with the <strong>garage door open</strong>? Or that <strong>CO</strong> passes through drywall and can seep into the house from the garage even if your door is tightly sealed? And, now with the ECO feature available in many cars, it is very easy to unknowingly leave a car running in a closed garage.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540329214/maibip2ovaqr7kwlf8zj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Car</strong>. Not only is it always a good idea to have a<strong> light in your car for emergencies</strong>, running the engine of a car stuck in the snow or mud to keep warm can cause <strong>CO to build up quickly in the cabin.</strong> This has happened too many times. This is another reason <strong>SafeT+</strong> is small enough to fit in a cup holder. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540329498/vwcwu7duuztd0t1kcdno.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p><strong>CO Poisoning Prevention Tips </strong></p>
<p><strong>Never</strong> leave the engine running in a vehicle parked in an enclosed or partially enclosed space or garage.</p>
<p><strong>Never</strong> run any gas powered engine <strong>(generator, power washer, blower, compressor)</strong> inside a garage, basement or any other enclosed building, even if the windows and doors are open. Gas powered engines must be vented correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Never</strong> run gas powered equipment including vehicles and generators near buildings where they can vent exhaust gases into open windows and doors. Recommended placement of a generator is 20 feet from an enclosed area.</p>
<p><strong>Never</strong> use an oil lantern, charcoal grill or propane/kerozene stove inside a tent, home or camper.</p>
<p><strong>Always use common sense before using any type of fossil fuel/wood in or near a structure. </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Security Camera</strong></h2>
<p>Security cameras have been commonplace in homes, businesses, hotel and resort hallways. So much so, that criminals have learned to look for and avoid them. However, due to privacy laws, hotels and vacation rentals do not have security cameras inside living quarters. Therefor, criminals do not look for them in these spaces. This makes bringing your own camera a great way to ensure your belongings are safe when you are out. SafeT+ motion activated safety camera offers:</p>
<p>HD video allows for capturing a high quality short video when needed.</p>
<p>A push signal sent to your phone within a second when camera is armed and motion is detected.</p>
<p>Low battery notifications. Recharge with fast charging micro USB.</p>
<h2>Specs</h2>
<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>
<p>Portable means we made it shockproof. The casing is made from a plastic compound for those everyday accidental drops.</p>
<p>Camera and light battery comes with a micro USB charging port.</p>
<p>The CO display is always displayed so there are no worries about whether or not it is working.</p>
<p>Early CO warning alert after 30 minutes if 30 ppm are detected. This low level detection lets you know if there is a CO problem before reaching dangerous CO levels. When CO detector is activated, the LED light in the lantern will flash and a loud 85 dB alarm will sound.</p>

</div></div>","The SafeT+ is an innovative new product that offers all around peace of mind, whether traveling or at home. It features: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Essential for travel
 
Why is SafeT+ essential for traveling? 
1. The CO detector. Most hotels, condos, apartments, and other residences have a smoke detector. However, very few have a CO detector. By now you have probably heard the report of the family that died in their sleep on vacation due to CO poisoning. What you probably do not know is that this is not a rare occurrence. In the US alone, 20,000 people are treated each year for CO poisoning. An early alert CO detector is essential to prevent sickness and even death.

 

2. The LED lantern. If you have ever been in a hotel during a power outage, you know how dark the rooms can get. And, if you have ever gone to a hotel bathroom in a blackout, which is almost always interior with no windows, you know the meaning of complete and utter darkness. This is why it is vital to have a light with you at all times. 
3. The Security camera. With all the new options for vacation accommodations available today, it is more important than ever to be vigilant about security. Vacation swaps, rentals by owner, and AirBNB are great alternatives to traditional hotels and resorts, but the same security measures are not used in these places. Keys are passed from person to person. On site security is not present in most situations. Owners are not vetted. For these reasons, a security camera is a must to ensure that no one is in your vacation rental while you are not.

 
 
Together, these features provide security and peace of mind, both while you are at and away from your vacation accommodations. 
Some Vacation Uses:

Other Suggested Uses:  
Dorms and student housing. On campus or off, student housing should be kept to a high standard. Sadly this is not always the case. Poor maintenance and old appliances and fixtures can be very dangerous. When your child sets off for college, CO poisoning should not be on the list of things you need to worry about.


Garage. Did you know that a running car can cause CO levels to rise above 100 ppm in minutes, even with the garage door open? Or that CO passes through drywall and can seep into the house from the garage even if your door is tightly sealed? And, now with the ECO feature available in many cars, it is very easy to unknowingly leave a car running in a closed garage.

Car. Not only is it always a good idea to have a light in your car for emergencies, running the engine of a car stuck in the snow or mud to keep warm can cause CO to build up quickly in the cabin. This has happened too many times. This is another reason SafeT+ is small enough to fit in a cup holder. 

Your home during a power outage. No matter where you live, at some point you can lose power due to snow, hurricane, tornado or just an unexpected issue. During a power outage, there are many dangers for CO poisoning.  A generator placed too close to the house or in a garage can easily fill a home with CO. Heavy snow can block a chimney and stop the CO being vented out of it. A propane/kerozene stove used inside can be a CO hazard as well as a fire hazard. 

 

CO Poisoning Prevention Tips 
Never leave the engine running in a vehicle parked in an enclosed or partially enclosed space or garage.
Never run any gas powered engine (generator, power washer, blower, compressor) inside a garage, basement or any other enclosed building, even if the windows and doors are open. Gas powered engines must be vented correctly.
Never run gas powered equipment including vehicles and generators near buildings where they can vent exhaust gases into open windows and doors. Recommended placement of a generator is 20 feet from an enclosed area.
Never use an oil lantern, charcoal grill or propane/kerozene stove inside a tent, home or camper.
Always use common sense before using any type of fossil fuel/wood in or near a structure.

<h3>What is Bare Toes?</h3>
<p>We are Bare Toes. Sleeping bags made with your feet in mind. </p>
<p>Have you ever been camping with one of those pesky, traditional sleeping bags? How annoying is it having your feet confined to a sweaty oven over night? Here at Bare Toes, we couldn't take it any more, so we created a better one. </p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/282617160?portrait=0""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p>Our bags are designed with a magnetic flap at the feet. This gives you the ability to kick your feet out for cool air and retract them back in for additional warmth. </p>
<p>We are human beings, not mermaids... so stop sleeping like one!</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Our effort to make Bare Toes happen will need YOUR help. We need to raise $25,000 to achieve our marketing goals, product testing, and of course manufacturing the first 500 Bare Toes bags. </p>
<p>With great support comes great perks. We are commited to decking our loyal fans out in the best swag known to man. Choose from three tiers of donation and we will ensure that you are well taken care of. </p>
<p>1. Bare Toes Sticker. We want you to tell the world that your feet don't sweat when you sleep. How do you do that you ask? We have stickers. Really cool stickers for that matter. Stickers you're going to want to put everywhere. On your computer, on your RAZOR flip phone, even on your 1973 Volkswagen Thing. Bottom line is, you'll want one.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533062863/py619i2u3wkeegeda8et.png"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></p>
<p>2. You want to take your Bare Toes love to the next level? We want to let you wear our brand and take it to the world! Climbing the Himmaleyas? Wear our shirt. Climbing out of bed? Wear our shirt. Climbing a ladder to unclog your gutters? Wear a different shirt, that sounds nasty.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3. Welcome to the Bare Toes original backers (or BTOB's). You will be able to own your very own Bare Toes bag from our original run of bags! Take it with you wherever you go and have a reminder that you belong to the most sacred group since the founding fathers.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of time (actually about 1876) people have used sleeping bags. And bless their hearts the things are just not comfortable. Our research suggests that more than 60% of people kick their hot feet out of the covers when they sleep, and doing that in a sleeping bag is near impossible without unzipping the entire thing. </p>
<p>Your donation is helping you. You and your sweaty hoofs need a break from the mundane sleeping bag. Let yourself... help yourself. </p>
<p>Your donation is for the millions of children and adults around the world who have had to keep their feet in a sweaty oven over night. Not donating keeps them in that cycle... nobody wants that. </p>
<p>Your donation is helping the dream of a young entreprenuer come true. It is helping a small business serve a big audience... and that is pretty cool.  </p>

<h3>Bare Toes Bag Specs</h3>
<p><strong>Shape</strong>: Mummy</p>
<p><strong>Length</strong>: 6.75 feet</p>
<p><strong>Fill Weight</strong>: 150 grams</p>
<p><strong>Shell</strong>:  210T Polyester Ripstop</p>
<p><strong>Temperature Rating</strong>: Will be conducted upon completion of campaign. We reccomend using the Bare Toes bag as a 3-season item. </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Over the last three years as we have developed this product, we have found that challenges come. Nothing ever goes exactly how you plan for it to. That is why we at Bare Toes clearly define risks and challenges in the forefront of our work. Here are a few we anticipate in the coming year. </p>
<p>1. <strong>Financial Challenge</strong> - Our minimum order quantity with our current manufacturer is 500 units. That is a large order to fill for a small startup company. The finances from this campaign will fullfill the first order. After making your bag, shipping, filing for a second patent and marketing, the leftover from the sale of those first 500 orders will cover roughly 80% of a second order. This will of course require more $$$. </p>
<p>2. <strong>Marketing Challenge</strong> - This challenge is summed up by two words... CUSTOMER LOYALTY. We know we have an awesome product. We have tested it, tweaked it and repeated. Now we need our customers to get behind us and spread the word. Ever heard someone say ""it takes a village"" well, we need you and your village to spread the word via social media and tell people how much you love our product!</p>
<p>3. <strong>Continued Growth</strong> - Our future is unknown. Heck, a Fortune 500 CEO's future is unknown. What we DO know is this, we have an awesome product that solves a pesky problem and we want to give it to the world. Part of that growth will be expanding our product line to fit all size humans (even little niños), continuing to make our bags better, and continuing to put a smile on the face of your feet. </p>

<p>Hello lovelies,</p>
<p>my dearest friend Nicole, whom some of you already know, is getting married with Julian on the next 2nd of April in MIAMI BEACH! It will be a super lovely and dreamy day by the beach at the Palms Hotel and Spa to celebrate the love of two of my favorites, I can't miss it!!! It's also the perfect opportunity for me to discover Florida for the first time ever, that's why I'm planning to stay there for one week. But for this I need your help! In order to finance the trip I need around 1000 euros: the flight ticket from Berlin costs approximately 500 euros and the extra 500 euros (if we get to it) will help to pay a hotel room/ air bnb for the week. Your help is precious and even a small donation will make me happy and take me closer to the goal! As a reward/ thank you gift and stay in the Miami mood you'll get a handmade funky THONG for a donation of 25 euros, a complete handmade BIKINI for 50 euros and for 100 euros you'll get a bikini PLUS the BEACH BAG that goes along! (in case of donations of 200 euros or more  I'll think about a special handmade gift specially made for you with love :D).</p>
<p>AAAAAND as I will be in Miami for my birthday you can also think about your donation as a kind of BIRTHDAY PRESENT...after all turning 44 is also a bit special!!!</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your help!</p>
<p>Lulu</p>
<p>***************************************************************************************</p>
<p>Mes chers</p>
<p>Ma très chère amie Nicole, que certains d'entre vous connaissent déjà, va se marier avec Julian le 2 Avril prochain à MIAMI BEACH!!! Cela va être un jour de rêve sur la plage au Palms Hotel and Spa où la cérémonie aura lieu pour célébrer l'amour de deux de mes amis préférés, impossible de rater ça!!! C'est aussi l'occasion pour moi de découvrir la Floride pour la toute première fois, c'est la raison pour laquelle je projette d'y séjourner une semaine. Mais pour cela j'ai besoin de votre aide! Pour financer ce voyage j'ai besoin d'à peu près 1000 euros: le billet d'avion depuis Berlin coûte environ 500 euros et les autres 500 euros (si on y arrive!) m'aideront à payer une chambre d'hôtel/air bnb pour la semaine. Votre aide est précieuse et une donation même modeste me rendra grand service et m'aidera à atteindre mon but! En gage de récompense et de remerciement, et pour rester dans l'esprit Miami, pour une donation de 25 euros vous recevrez un STRING funky fait main, un BIKINI complet pour 50 euros et pour 100 euros le bikini PLUS le SAC DE PLAGE qui va avec! (pour un éventuel don de 200 euros ou plus je vais réfléchir à un cadeau spécialement pour vous fait avec amour par mes petites mains :D)</p>
<p>EEEEET comme je serai à Miami pour mon anniversaire vous pouvez aussi considérer votre don comme un CADEAU D'ANNIVERSAIRE....après tout avoir 44 ans c'est aussi un peu spécial!!!</p>
<p>Par avance un grand merci pour votre aide!</p>

my dearest friend Nicole, whom some of you already know, is getting married with Julian on the next 2nd of April in MIAMI BEACH! It will be a super lovely and dreamy day by the beach at the Palms Hotel and Spa to celebrate the love of two of my favorites, I can't miss it!!! It's also the perfect opportunity for me to discover Florida for the first time ever, that's why I'm planning to stay there for one week. But for this I need your help! In order to finance the trip I need around 1000 euros: the flight ticket from Berlin costs approximately 500 euros and the extra 500 euros (if we get to it) will help to pay a hotel room/ air bnb for the week. Your help is precious and even a small donation will make me happy and take me closer to the goal! As a reward/ thank you gift and stay in the Miami mood you'll get a handmade funky THONG for a donation of 25 euros, a complete handmade BIKINI for 50 euros and for 100 euros you'll get a bikini PLUS the BEACH BAG that goes along! (in case of donations of 200 euros or more  I'll think about a special handmade gift specially made for you with love :D).
AAAAAND as I will be in Miami for my birthday you can also think about your donation as a kind of BIRTHDAY PRESENT...after all turning 44 is also a bit special!!!
Thank you in advance for your help!
Lulu

Mes chers
Ma très chère amie Nicole, que certains d'entre vous connaissent déjà, va se marier avec Julian le 2 Avril prochain à MIAMI BEACH!!! Cela va être un jour de rêve sur la plage au Palms Hotel and Spa où la cérémonie aura lieu pour célébrer l'amour de deux de mes amis préférés, impossible de rater ça!!! C'est aussi l'occasion pour moi de découvrir la Floride pour la toute première fois, c'est la raison pour laquelle je projette d'y séjourner une semaine. Mais pour cela j'ai besoin de votre aide! Pour financer ce voyage j'ai besoin d'à peu près 1000 euros: le billet d'avion depuis Berlin coûte environ 500 euros et les autres 500 euros (si on y arrive!) m'aideront à payer une chambre d'hôtel/air bnb pour la semaine. Votre aide est précieuse et une donation même modeste me rendra grand service et m'aidera à atteindre mon but! En gage de récompense et de remerciement, et pour rester dans l'esprit Miami, pour une donation de 25 euros vous recevrez un STRING funky fait main, un BIKINI complet pour 50 euros et pour 100 euros le bikini PLUS le SAC DE PLAGE qui va avec! (pour un éventuel don de 200 euros ou plus je vais réfléchir à un cadeau spécialement pour vous fait avec amour par mes petites mains :D)
EEEEET comme je serai à Miami pour mon anniversaire vous pouvez aussi considérer votre don comme un CADEAU D'ANNIVERSAIRE....après tout avoir 44 ans c'est aussi un peu spécial!!!
Par avance un grand merci pour votre aide!

<p>On the inside you will find a transparent film pocket with a zipper, sewn into the leather cover.</p>
<p>Regardless of the weather, you can safely store your tickets, photographs, souvenirs and even a smartphone (you don't even have to take it out, the plastic allows you to use the touchscreen). </p>

<p>The brass spine enable bundles of PINE paper to be inserted and replaced when necessary (each set can be screwed into the notebook through the brass spine).</p>
<p>Only the highest quality paper is used - the first seven pages are functional (i.e. travel plans, transport, accommodation and check lists) and the remaining 38 pages are left blank with travel motifs in the background. </p>

<p>Every set of paper comes in a white cardboard box where you can store all your memories once you've finished each journey. A handy tag allows you to easily label and organise your journeys.</p>

Pine notebook is pure nature !
Leather cover ,brass grip and handmade wood   pencil make  your travel earth friendly.  Let's go meet Nature .


Make your travel stay with you for the rest of your lifePine is seemingly an ordinary notebook with a leather cover and a bundle of papers. Look inside and you’ll see its surprising content! This notebook is intended not only for the trip itself, but also to store the souvenirs the trips have brought you! 


What does PINE contain inside
The notebook has been designed entirely by us. The cover is made of high quality leather. There’s a transparent foil sewn in. Together with the cover they make a zipped pocket. A bras handle with a metal pendent is attached to the cover. Over a year of hard work with PINE resulted in designing a notebook dedicated to true travellers!

The A5 notebook's cover is made out of a single piece of leather with the PINE logo on the front and your name embossed on the back. You can carry it like any other A5 book, but the flexibility of the leather means that you can also fold it in half and put it in your pocket, jacket or backpack.



On the inside you will find a transparent film pocket with a zipper, sewn into the leather cover.
Regardless of the weather, you can safely store your tickets, photographs, souvenirs and even a smartphone (you don't even have to take it out, the plastic allows you to use the touchscreen). 

The brass spine enable bundles of PINE paper to be inserted and replaced when necessary (each set can be screwed into the notebook through the brass spine).
Only the highest quality paper is used - the first seven pages are functional (i.e. travel plans, transport, accommodation and check lists) and the remaining 38 pages are left blank with travel motifs in the background. 

Every set of paper comes in a white cardboard box where you can store all your memories once you've finished each journey. A handy tag allows you to easily label and organise your journeys.
To complete the PINE experience you will receive a hand-crafted pencil that perfectly accompanies your notebook (either attached to the brass spine or stored in the pocket).",27.0,0,"1 Campaign

I wanted to know why the fireflies gave out such beautiful light, why a bird could fly in the sky while I couldn't, and how an ant could carry things bigger than itself. So much to explore, wonder and learn!At Sunny Acorn, we design toys to satisfy kids' curiosity about how the world works.      Only 0.28 oz, lighter than a grape!The Eagle Drone is super nimble: It can skillfully avoid obstacles, keep a fixed height or elegantly land on your hands with the push of a button. Stable performance with 6 axis gyroscope. Easy to control. On button altitude hold for easy flying. Gravity sensing control based transmitter allows easy, intuitive movement (forward, backward, left and right).The controller fits easily in your pocket. Control Eagle anywhere, anytime. Even without anyone else knowing!You can charge your Eagle Drone anytime and anywhere with your phone, ipad, computer or included charger. Pledge now and help us bring this amazing drone to life!Thank you to BackerPoints for supporting our campaign, they are awesome!",11.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>BeenThere Map Online</h3>
<p>The BeenThere Map Online project is very special to us, because for the first time in the world an application is developed thanks to which every person who loves travelling (all of us!) will be able to mark on the map the countries, regions, locations, trails, sports facilities and many other places they have visited, and to share them through social media or a website, online – in a simple, hassle-free way, during their trip or right after returning home. Thanks to BeenThere Map it is also possible to create a chronicle of your journeys and of the places you have visited and to give them unique features by publishing your photographs, giving them a title, and publishing your avatar and nickname.</p>
<p>Various maps in different designs will be available in the application – besides conventional maps there will also be “cyber punk” maps, “looking at the stars” maps, “black-red world” maps, “marine” maps, “old school” maps, any many others. The only thing that limits the number of maps available in the application and their design is our imagination…</p>
<p>BeenThere Map Online is currently at the stage of “a working prototype”, with several maps to choose from.</p>
<p>The objective of our campaign is most of all to complete the application development process – to enable the transition from a working prototype to a finished product, available online, as well as to test it, to extend it with several planned functionalities, to develop subsequent maps of the world, countries, locations, etc., and to widely promote the application online.</p>

<h3>How we minimise risks in the project</h3>
<p>As of the launch of the campaign, the BeenThere Map Online application is not just an idea, but the stage of “a working prototype”, with several maps to choose from, after first successful tests. Hence the risk that the project will not be implemented is significantly lower (minor). We are moving on to the extension stage, when new functions will be added, new thematic map sets will be developed, and when we will work on making the application accessible online and promoting it widely. Our experienced team and their commitment constitutes the foundation of significant minimisation of all possible risks of failure.</p>
</div></div>","BeenThere Map Online
is an easy-to-use eco-friendly application, the first one to enable every single person to mark on specially prepared maps the countries and locations they have visited worldwide, to personalise the maps, and to share them with their friends in social media, while caring for the environment!
 
Features of the applications:


Easy and pleasant to use – can be used by everyone on the Internet

Online – no need to install anything on your computer or smartphone,

Quick – it operates in a web browser and it is based on the efficient HD Map Technology,

Design – unique, characteristic layout of all the maps,

Mobile – accessible anywhere, from computers, laptops, and smartphones


Many maps to choose from:
BeenThere Map will have several dozen different maps to offer, e.g.:

Of the world, the continents, the region,
Of the country which you love visiting,
Of national parks, nature reserves, UNESCO sites,
Of mountain trails, waterways, bike tracks, car routes (e.g. Route 66), motorcycle routes,
Sports facilities in different countries (e.g. NHL, NBA, football leagues),
Concert tours,
Other facilities (e.g. global airports, ports),
The sky is the limit…


The selection of available maps will be constantly growing!
Map personalisation
You can give your unique features to each map – a title, your nickname, avatar, you can also add your photographs with descriptions of places you have visited, which will enhance the individual character of your maps.

Share your travels with your friends !
Make use of FB and other social media and show your friends where you have been. 
 


BeenThere Map Online
The BeenThere Map Online project is very special to us, because for the first time in the world an application is developed thanks to which every person who loves travelling (all of us!) will be able to mark on the map the countries, regions, locations, trails, sports facilities and many other places they have visited, and to share them through social media or a website, online – in a simple, hassle-free way, during their trip or right after returning home. Thanks to BeenThere Map it is also possible to create a chronicle of your journeys and of the places you have visited and to give them unique features by publishing your photographs, giving them a title, and publishing your avatar and nickname.
Various maps in different designs will be available in the application – besides conventional maps there will also be “cyber punk” maps, “looking at the stars” maps, “black-red world” maps, “marine” maps, “old school” maps, any many others. The only thing that limits the number of maps available in the application and their design is our imagination…
BeenThere Map Online is currently at the stage of “a working prototype”, with several maps to choose from.
The objective of our campaign is most of all to complete the application development process – to enable the transition from a working prototype to a finished product, available online, as well as to test it, to extend it with several planned functionalities, to develop subsequent maps of the world, countries, locations, etc., and to widely promote the application online.
 
Our Ambassadors:
Ambassadors of our campaign and ambassadors of BeenThere Maps Online are Elisabeth and Andrew – experienced travellers (over 40 years), journalists, authors of travel books and TV shows, members of the prestigious Explorers Club in New York.

 
Our Action:
Maps – publish online – do not print!

We are aware of the quantities of paper used every single day to print different documents, often quite unnecessarily.
Printing maps is not an exception in this respect. As professionals, we know that in the majority of cases printouts are not necessary to make full use of the map.
Printed maps lose many values that online maps have, such as e.g. the updating and personalisation options.

We believe that undertaking and promoting even the smallest initiatives addressing environmental protection can have significant results. Therefore, in our BeenThere Map Online project we will promote the slogan: Maps – publish online – do not print!
The promotion of the campaign “Maps – publish online – do not print!” will be partially financed by funds collected through Indiegogo.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>“The purpose of life is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experience.”</p>
<p>― Eleanor Roosevelt</p>
<p>I’m Captain Zorah Rose and I believe that life is for living! I’ve dedicated the past 3 years to bringing Creative Concierge SF into existence so I can help you create life-long memories with the people you love. In addition to the pro-bono Seaheart Kids Sailing Camp, I offer bespoke San Francisco Bay sailing experiences on the S/V Seaheart, a fully restored 36-foot Islander sailboat.</p>
<p>The thing is The Seaheart is ready and sailing as a Coast Guard Approved charter vessel on the California Coast.  The galley and head  are needing to be updated to be completely restored and cozy for overnight excursions in the bay or out the gate.  Of course we like bells and whistles too and need raise capital for all that. That’s where you come in. I’m offering you a variety of sailing experiences in return for your financial contribution to my goal of making the world a better place through the restorative powers of sailing.</p>
<p>Buy yourself a sailing experience; of a moonlit adventure, surprise engagement, weddings, celebration of life, birthdays, anniversaries; give a gift of sailing or donate to our community outreach pro bono sails. Help us create memories that we can all share for generations.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to provide world-class experiences and make the world a better place, I need your help to complete the upgrades to the Seaheart. </p>
<p>A little bit about the boat:</p>
<p>S/V Seaheart is a 36-foot Islander, a classic California-made sturdy cruiser built in the mid-70s. The “Islander 36” was a forerunner among dual-purpose racer/cruisers, boats with enough performance for competition-minded sailors and enough comfort for cruising. It’s nice wide cabin, complete with a stowaway table and plenty of headroom, sleeps 6 people and has a spacious deck for seeing the sights and soaking up the sun. It’s perfect for a short cruise, a weekend getaway, or a long-haul sail up or down the coast.</p>
<p>I bought this beautiful boat earlier this year and immediately began work to restore it to its original glory. My team and I have already made significant repairs and upgrades to the functionality, safety, and comfort of the boat. So far, we’ve had a haul out with bottom job, new thru holes, new valves, serviced the engine; pulled the mast, new electrical, painted the deck and kiwi grip; added new standing rigging and hardware; rebedded the stanchions, rebuilt the transom,  added a new bilge pump, water pump and macerator;  installed new cockpit cushions; as well as dozens of other little tweaks to make this a spectacularly safe, comfortable and fun ship.</p>
<p>But there’s still work to be done, so I'm calling on you to book a sailing adventure with me. In return for your financial contribution, you’ll receive a reservation for a sailing experience on and around beautiful San Francisco Bay. Take a look at the options on the right to choose the best for your desires and budget. </p>
<p>My goal is to pre-sell charters, overnight excursions, sailing lessons, or add retainer clients to my sailing club so I can complete the restoration of this fine coastal cruising vessel and help you “to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experience.” </p>
<p>This campaign will be regularly updated with new Specials &amp; Adventure Availability</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The goal of Creative Concierge SF (and my personal mission) is to spread connection, camaraderie, and magic in the world. I do this in my own unique way by creating sailing packages that lead to once-in-a-lifetime experiences with lasting memories. Whether it’s a short 2-hour excursion in the Bay, a sunset or moon lit cruise, or a full-blown overnight adventure, you’ll not only get the unforgettable experience - you’ll get the satisfaction of knowing that you’ve contributed to making these experiences possible for countless others. One of our pet projects is a pro-bono kids’ sailing camp where we share the wonders of sailing with youth that would otherwise never have a chance. We’re deeply committed to bringing meaning, connection, and empowerment to young people.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<p>About Captain Zorah</p>
<p>I have been on and around boats regularly for over 40 years. My grandfather had a boat in Boston Harbor and all my siblings all have boats. Being on the ocean is in my blood and after sailing the bay more than 430 times in less than 8 years, I have become one with the Bay. I’m intimately familiar with its varying conditions, demanding tides, and entertaining opportunities for world-class adventures in nature. I’m committed to sharing the transformative power of sailing as a way to improve mental health, physical aptitude, teamwork, and confidence.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p> I’ll guide you through the magic of the Bay by visiting the nooks and crannies only accessible by an avid Captain who has investigated the ins and outs of its special locations.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>I pride myself on being a “social artist”. That means that I naturally build camaraderie and confidence among my guests and crew. I’ve been told that my wholehearted love of life, nature, and people is an infectious force for bringing joy into people’s lives. Whether it’s the sight of the moon rising over the Golden Gate Bridge, the sounds of whale song heard through our underwater microphone rig, or the feel and smell of the salt spray, I love sharing this incredibly special place with other good people. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>What will we do with your contribution?</p>
<p>Let’s face facts. Refurbishing a 36-foot sailboat is not an easy or inexpensive task. Our team has already spent countless hours and tens of thousands of dollars getting the Seaheart ready to host passengers. It’s seaworthy and safe and taking people out but we need your help to fine-tune the details and make it a truly special experience-building-machine.</p>
<p>When you buy one of the perks, your money will fund the materials and labor for our remaining upgrades, renovations and dream touches. What are those upgrades, renovations and dreams?</p>
<p>Refinished the teak woodwork : topside and cabin</p>
<p>Modernized the galley: propane burner stove, convection oven, cookware and counter top</p>
<p>Modernize the head: new plumbing, H2O tanks and shower (already hot water off the engine)</p>
<p>Modernize the electrical</p>
<p>New foam for the cushions</p>
<p>Offshore and kids life vest</p>
<p>6 person life raft</p>
<p>Upgrade Instruments</p>
<p>Fishing gear for Salmon and Crabs</p>
<p>New Sails</p>
<p>With your help, the Seaheart will be ready for the next 15 years of memory-making. This has been an incredible journey and it's only going to get more interesting and adventurous. Are you coming? Bring your friends. Send your people. Because we need you to help us convert this dream of spreading wonder into reality!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>A big challenge we’re facing is how to reach people who want to share in this ride. Over the years, I’ve met a LOT of great people through sailing and my previous work with Premium Pour and Jaxx Locals Lounge. If you’ve had a great experience with me (on the water or on land), I implore you to share your personal experiences and (especially) photos at <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/creativeconciergeSF"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/creativeconciergeSF</a>. If you know anyone who loves the water, nature and making awesome memories, please share this campaign with them. I need your help to make this dream a reality!</p>

   Which device for the mountains? 




                                                                        

   SANKIboard - is the first full-blown snowboard suspension in the World. All you need to enjoy your ride - is your snowboard, bindings, boots and this innovative system, that amortizes all bumps and pits on the trail. 


You don't depend on a whims of nature and conditions of tracks. 
Minimization of muscle ""clogging"" effect during long riding.
Absence of hard-hitting on landing.
Minimization of riders' occupational knee and spine diseases.
More stable carving due to unsprung weight.
 The gap lets you avoid the contact of your boots and the slope during agressive carving. 
Universal suspension integrates with any type of snowboard bindings. 
And the most important, is a unique opportunity to use it as a personal bench without fear to freeze your ass of)).













                                                                         

Final  design of the platform.




   The gear kit
includes 2 flat springs, 2 fixing racks, set of clamping plates and standart metric fittings
and could be easily installed by only one usual allen key. 

   For SANKIboard PRO kit  we use fiberglass and wood, reinforced by carbon and the aluminium alloy.  All together it provides low weight 2,4 kg with high reliability.

   The brand got its name from the Russian word for санки (sanki), is translated as sled.                                                         
 Inventing SANKIboard we've done a great job with a lot of victories and setbacks.

The funding will be going towards adding a Newsfeed, similar to that of other social networking apps where your posts are for you, your friends and those in your area or areas to see. It will update the calendar to make it easier to navigate the Events through the year including a search function. Sharing the events on the RowlOut app, with friends and other social media networks will also be easier. Updating the Groups function will allow one to create groups and add riders to it or allow other riders to request to join. Alerts will get an upgrade to include adding Amber alerts and making it easier to post an alert in different areas that you do or don’t follow. The Rides section of the app will be updated so that customizable rides can be created for those specific outings. A profile page will be added for friends lists, along with a way to message friends or other riders. The RowlOut.com website will also be updated to mimic all functions of the mobile app, so it can be accessed from a laptop or desktop computer.

</p>Somos
 Juan y Karina, una pareja joven, que hemos dejado muchas cosas atrás (casa, trabajo, amigos, país) para apostar por éste sueño.<br/>Nos
 apasiona la naturaleza y creemos firmemente en que se puede disfrutar 
de ella sin dañarla. Dejando de lado el turismo de masas y apostando por
 un turismo más <p>respetuoso con el entorno. Un día, cansados de nuestra rutina y en plena crisis existencial, decidimos buscar una casa en cualquier lugar del mundo para meditar y ordenar nuestras ideas.<br/>Así,
 hemos encontrado éste lugar al norte de Portugal, del que nunca 
habíamos oído hablar, que nos sorprendió por su belleza natural y por la
 paz que nos transmitió.<br/>¿Cómo no enamorarse de un lugar como éste?<br/> Así empezó nuestra idea….¿Cómo compartir esta sensación con los demás?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>La idea:</strong><br/>Partiendo
 de esta premisa y con la ilusión de habernos topado con un lugar mágico
 y poco explorado, hemos creado y creído en esta idea:  Construir  un 
conjunto de 5 cabañas en los árboles , ¡ ayúdanos a hacerla realidad !.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Qué
necesitamos:</b></p>
<p>El
proyecto esta aprobado en el ayuntamiento, ya contamos con la
licencia para construir y están todos los diseños arquitectónicos
preparados para ponernos en marcha. Sólo nos hace falta tu apoyo
para recaudar 16500€ para construir nuestra primera casa.</p>
<p></p>

<p>Nuestro
objetivo es construir un total de 5 casas árbol, con la intención 
de promover un turismo a pequeña escala eco-consciente basado en
disfrutar de la naturaleza de forma respetuosa y con especial cuidado
en el medio ambiente.
</p>
<p>
La fecha
de inicio la construcción esta prevista para el 10/02/2016 una vez
finalizada la campaña de crowdfunding.</p>
<p>
La
duración de la construcción será de 45 días por casa, con lo que
esperamos tener todo preparado para inaugurar en el mes de mayo de
2016.</p>
<p>Decidimos
hacer un presupuesto escalonado, así por cada 16500€ recaudados
podríamos construir una casa árbol con un máximo de 5.</p>
<p>Nuestra campaña de crowdfunding es del tipo fija"" todo o nada"", esto significa que las donaciones se harán efectivas solamente en el caso de alcanzar nuestro primer objetivo:  16500€. En caso contrario, todos los aportes serán devueltos de forma 100 x 100 segura. Ya que nosotros no tendremos acceso al dinero hasta que la campaña no este finalizada y el objetivo alcanzado.<br/></p>

 encontramos al norte de Portugal en el conselho de Vieira do Minho. En 
una  zona  incluída en la reserva ecológica nacional debido a su riqueza
 de fauna y flora, junto al Parque Nacional Peneda Gerês (único parque 
nacional de Portugal y que comparte con el norte de España). Desde 
nuestra ubicación nos sorprenden los avistamientos de corzos, caballos

<strong>Consciencia ecológica:</strong><br/>Nuestra
 sociedad está dando un cambio, cada vez más y más gente es consciente de la importancia de vivir en armonía con la naturaleza, sin dañarla. 
Esta consciencia ecológica nos ha llevado a que todo nuestro proyecto 
esté basado en formar parte de ella, intentando modificar lo menos 
posible el entorno. Además estamos comprometidos con el trabajo regional
 , colaborando con agricultores de productos orgánicos de la zona.<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<br/><strong></strong><p><strong>Descripción técnica:</strong><br/>Las
 cabañas se construirán con un formato hexagonal de 24m2  a una altura 
de  2,50 a 3,00 metros desde el suelo a la base , obteniendo así un 
fácil acceso, dejando la terraza /balcón/mirador a una altura 
considerablemente mayor gracias a la pendiente natural del terreno.<br/>La
 madera, que es un potente regulador de la humedad  y el aislamiento 
elegidos proporcionan una óptima climatización con mínimos recursos, 
consiguiendo así máximos resultados con el menor impacto medioambiental.<br/>Las
 cabañas están pensadas para apoyarse en los árboles, cuidándolos al 
máximo,  mediante un sistema innovador de soportes que sostienen la 
estructura sin dañarlo gracias a la compartimentalización del árbol y sin impedir el crecimiento natural del mismo ( ver <a href=""http://treehouses.com/joomla/index.php/construction/garnier-limb%20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Michael Garnier Limb</a>). Además de un diseño que armoniza  con el entorno.  El mobiliario 
interior será en su mayoría de madera reciclada y se proveerá  a las 
cabañas de energías renovables (dependiendo de lo recaudado).<br/>Todas las cabañas estarán provistas de agua y luz.<br/>Baño independiente (ducha y wc).</p>

TREEHOUSE TOURISMUn
 lugar donde la naturaleza es la protagonista. Con la inspiración de un 
paisaje mágico, cuidando con mucho detalle el impacto medioambiental. 
Estas casas árbol han sido diseñadas para fundirse con el bosque sin 
dañarlo, donde los árboles no sufren con las construcciones y se utiliza
 para el interior madera reciclada.Nuestra historia:  


Somos
 Juan y Karina, una pareja joven, que hemos dejado muchas cosas atrás (casa, trabajo, amigos, país) para apostar por éste sueño.Nos
 apasiona la naturaleza y creemos firmemente en que se puede disfrutar 
de ella sin dañarla. Dejando de lado el turismo de masas y apostando por
 un turismo más respetuoso con el entorno. Un día, cansados de nuestra rutina y en plena crisis existencial, decidimos buscar una casa en cualquier lugar del mundo para meditar y ordenar nuestras ideas.Así,
 hemos encontrado éste lugar al norte de Portugal, del que nunca 
habíamos oído hablar, que nos sorprendió por su belleza natural y por la
 paz que nos transmitió.¿Cómo no enamorarse de un lugar como éste? Así empezó nuestra idea….¿Cómo compartir esta sensación con los demás?

La idea:Partiendo
 de esta premisa y con la ilusión de habernos topado con un lugar mágico
 y poco explorado, hemos creado y creído en esta idea:  Construir  un 
conjunto de 5 cabañas en los árboles , ¡ ayúdanos a hacerla realidad !.

Qué
necesitamos:
El
proyecto esta aprobado en el ayuntamiento, ya contamos con la
licencia para construir y están todos los diseños arquitectónicos
preparados para ponernos en marcha. Sólo nos hace falta tu apoyo
para recaudar 16500€ para construir nuestra primera casa.




Nuestro
objetivo es construir un total de 5 casas árbol, con la intención 
de promover un turismo a pequeña escala eco-consciente basado en
disfrutar de la naturaleza de forma respetuosa y con especial cuidado
en el medio ambiente.


La fecha
de inicio la construcción esta prevista para el 10/02/2016 una vez
finalizada la campaña de crowdfunding.

La
duración de la construcción será de 45 días por casa, con lo que
esperamos tener todo preparado para inaugurar en el mes de mayo de
2016.
Decidimos
hacer un presupuesto escalonado, así por cada 16500€ recaudados
podríamos construir una casa árbol con un máximo de 5.
Nuestra campaña de crowdfunding es del tipo fija"" todo o nada"", esto significa que las donaciones se harán efectivas solamente en el caso de alcanzar nuestro primer objetivo:  16500€. En caso contrario, todos los aportes serán devueltos de forma 100 x 100 segura. Ya que nosotros no tendremos acceso al dinero hasta que la campaña no este finalizada y el objetivo alcanzado.
Ubicación del terreno:
Nuestras coordenadas:  41˚38' 56'' N – 8˚ 10' 33'' W
Nos
 encontramos al norte de Portugal en el conselho de Vieira do Minho. En 
una  zona  incluída en la reserva ecológica nacional debido a su riqueza
 de fauna y flora, junto al Parque Nacional Peneda Gerês (único parque 
nacional de Portugal y que comparte con el norte de España). Desde 
nuestra ubicación nos sorprenden los avistamientos de corzos, caballos 
salvajes y una fantástica variedad de aves entre las que se encuentran 
..el milano real, el ratonero común, el búho real, el halcón y la 
tarabilla norteña entre otros. Todo esto con el embalse de Caniçada como
 fondo.Es un lugar estratégico situado en medio de la naturaleza 
pero con la comodidad de la cercanía de ciudades como Braga, Porto y 
Vigo.

Un buen punto de partida para 
conocer infinidad de lugares de interés en sus alrededores . Con un 
sinfín de opciones de deportes acuaticos y terrestres como trekking, 
kayak, canyoning, escalada, rappel, equitación, pesca,etc

Descripción del lugar de construcción:Un
 bosque con árboles verdes y enormes, una naciente de agua de montaña en
 su centro y de fondo  un espejo brillante y cristalino formado por la 
albufeira del rio Cávado. Con una cabaña de madera , un bosque en el que
 los árboles se plantaron con menos de un metro y hoy  miden mas de 20!.El
 bosque donde se encontrarán nuestras casas árbol es un lugar mágico y 
colorido donde se respira aire puro y se escucha el canto de los 
pájaros, un lugar ideal para descansar y limpiarse del stress de la vida
 cotidiana.Se encuentra en medio de una región antiguamente celta 
donde nuestros antepasados veneraban  a los bosques, las piedras y el 
agua por encima de todo . Tierra de donde nacen infinidad de mitos y 
leyendas. Filosofía:Cierra los ojos
 e imagínate por un momento descansando en un árbol, dejándote invadir 
por el aire puro y los sonidos de la naturaleza. Tal vez escuches  el 
ruido de una cascada cerca o el susurro del viento entre los árboles. Creemos que estas son las sensaciones que enriquecen nuestras vidas, nos hacen reflexionar, meditar……nos inspiran.


Consciencia ecológica:Nuestra
 sociedad está dando un cambio, cada vez más y más gente es consciente de la importancia de vivir en armonía con la naturaleza, sin dañarla. 
Esta consciencia ecológica nos ha llevado a que todo nuestro proyecto 
esté basado en formar parte de ella, intentando modificar lo menos 
posible el entorno. Además estamos comprometidos con el trabajo regional
 , colaborando con agricultores de productos orgánicos de la zona.

Descripción técnica:Las
 cabañas se construirán con un formato hexagonal de 24m2  a una altura 
de  2,50 a 3,00 metros desde el suelo a la base , obteniendo así un 
fácil acceso, dejando la terraza /balcón/mirador a una altura 
considerablemente mayor gracias a la pendiente natural del terreno.La
 madera, que es un potente regulador de la humedad  y el aislamiento 
elegidos proporcionan una óptima climatización con mínimos recursos, 
consiguiendo así máximos resultados con el menor impacto medioambiental.Las
 cabañas están pensadas para apoyarse en los árboles, cuidándolos al 
máximo,  mediante un sistema innovador de soportes que sostienen la 
estructura sin dañarlo gracias a la compartimentalización del árbol y sin impedir el crecimiento natural del mismo ( ver Michael Garnier Limb). Además de un diseño que armoniza  con el entorno.  El mobiliario 
interior será en su mayoría de madera reciclada y se proveerá  a las 
cabañas de energías renovables (dependiendo de lo recaudado).Todas las cabañas estarán provistas de agua y luz.Baño independiente (ducha y wc).



Proyectos futuros:Piscina (reparación) y agua salada.Pelletadora y calefacción a pellets generados a partir de hojas y ramas de nuestro bosque.Construir cascada con generador hídrico para proveer de electricidad a las cabañas.Huerta ecológica.Zona de árboles frutales ( se plantarán arboles frutales gracias a las donaciones que tienen como recompensa apadrinar un árbol).
Gracias y no olvides escoger tu recompensa !!!

TREEHOUSE TOURISM





 

Um lugar onde a natureza é a protagonista, inspirando-se numa paisagem mágica, tendo como grande cuidado o impacto ambiental. Estas casas nas árvores são projetadas para se misturar com a floresta sem a danificar, onde as árvores não sofrem com as construções e com utilização de madeira reciclada  no seu interior.





A nossa história:  



Nós somos Juan e Karina, um jovem casal que deixou muitas coisas para trás (casa, trabalho, amigos, país,…) para apostar neste sonho.Nós amamos a natureza e acreditamos verdadeiramente que se pode desfrutar dela sem a danificar, deixando de lado o turismo em massa e com foco num turismo mais eco-friendly. Um dia, cansados da nossa rotina e em plena crise existencial, decidimos procurar uma casa em qualquer lugar do mundo para meditar e organizar as nossas ideias.Então, nós encontramos este lugar no norte de Portugal, do qual nunca tinhamos ouvido falar. Fomos surpreendidos pela sua beleza natural e paz que nos acolheu.Como não amar um lugar como este?Assim começou a nossa ideia... Como compartilhar este sentimento com os outros?

A idéa:
 

Nesta base, e com a ilusão de ter encontrado um lugar mágico e inexplorado, criamos e acreditamos nesta ideia: construir um conjunto de 5 casas nas árvores! Ajude-nos a fazer com que isto aconteça!



O qué precisamos:



 

O projecto foi aprovado pela câmara, e já temos a licença para construir, os projectos de arquitectura estão todos concluídos. Só precisamos do seu apoio para reunir 16.500,00 € para construir a nossa primeira casa na árvore.







O Nosso objetivo é construir um total de 5 casas nas árvores, com a intenção de promover o turismo de pequena escala eco-consciente, com base na filosofia de apreciar a natureza com respeito e tendo cuidado especial com o ambiente.A data de início da construção está prevista para 10/02/2016 quando a campanha crowdfunding estiver concluída. A duração da construção é de 45 dias por casa, esperamos ter tudo pronto para abrir maio de 2016.Decidimos fazer um orçamento em fases e para cada uma delas necessitamos de reunir os 16.500,00 €, deste modo, poderiamos construir uma casa na árvore até a um máximo de 5 casas. A nossa campanha é fixa ""tudo ou nada"", isso significa que as doações só serão eficazes se atingirmos o nosso principal objetivo: 16.500,00 €. Caso contrário, todas as contribuições serão integralmente devolvidas com 100% de segurança, isto porque não teremos acesso ao dinheiro até que a campanha não esteja terminada e o objetivo alcançado.Ubicaçâo do terreno:
Nossas coordenadas:  41˚38' 56'' N – 8˚ 10' 33'' W
Estamos no norte de Portugal, no concelho de Vieira do Minho, numa área incluída na reserva ecológica nacional, devido à sua riqueza de fauna e flora, junto ao Parque Nacional de Peneda Gerês (único parque nacional em Portugal e partilhado com o norte de Espanha). É nesta nossa localização que ficamos constantemente surpresos com os aparecimentos de Corços, Garranos e uma grande variedade de aves entre os quais estão o Milhafre-Real, Águia-de-Asa-Redonda, Águia-Real, Coruja, Gavião e o Cartaxo Nortenho entre outros. Tudo isto com a barragem da Caniçada como fundo.  É uma localização estratégica, situada no meio da natureza, mas com a conveniência da proximidade de cidades como Braga, Porto e Vigo.


Um bom ponto de partida para explorar muitos locais de interesse na área circundante. Com infinitas opções de desportos de água e terra como trekking, canoagem, canyoning, escalada, rapel, passeios a cavalo, pesca, etc.

Descripción del lugar de construcción:Uma enorme floresta com árvores verdes, uma nascente de água em seu centro e um brilhante espelho cristalino como fundo, formado pela albufeira do rio Cávado. Com uma cabana de madeira, uma floresta onde as árvores foram plantadas com menos de um metro e hoje tem mais de 20 !.
 A mata onde nossas casas vão se encontrar é um lugar mágico e colorido, onde poder respirar ar puro e ouvir o canto dos pássaros, um lugar para descansar e limpar do stress da vida quotidiana.




 

Ele está no meio duma região anteriormente Celta onde os nossos antepassados adoraram as árvores, rochas e água por acima de tudo. Terra de onde nasceram numerosos mitos e lendas.
 Filosofía:
 

Feche os olhos e imagine-se por um momento a descansar sob de uma árvore, deixando-se invadir pelo  ar puro e pelos sons da natureza. Talvez possa ouvir o som de uma cascata perto ou o vento sussurrante através das árvores. Nós acreditamos que estes são os sentimentos que enriquecem as nossas vidas, que nos fazem refletir, meditar ... inspirar-nos!.




Consciência ecológica: A nossa sociedade está a mudar, mais e mais pessoas estão conscientes da importância de viver em harmonia com a natureza sem a danificar. Esta consciência ecológica levou-nos a realizar todo o nosso projecto por forma a se integrar como parte dela, tentando modificar o ambiente o menos possível. Nós também estamos comprometidos com o trabalho regional, asociando-nos com os agricultores orgânicos (Agricultura Biológica) da região.

Descriçâo técnica:As casinhas serão construídas com um formato hexagonal 24m2 a uma altura de 2,50 a 3,00 metros do chão, obtendo-se assim fácil acesso, deixando o terraço / varanda para uma consideravelmente maior altura graças à inclinação natural do terreno. A madeira, que é um regulador potente de humidade e o isolamento escolhido, proporcionam uma climatização óptima com mínimos recursos, alcançando o máximo de resultados com o menor impacto ambiental.
As casas estão projetadas para a construção nas árvores, tendo em conta a sua maxima preservação, através de um sistema inovador de suportes que prendem a estrutura sem a danificar, graças à compartimentação da árvore e sem impedir o crescimento natural dela (ver Michael Garnier Limb). Além de um desenho que se harmoniza com o ambiente. O mobiliário interior é principalmente madeira reciclada e as cabanas serão equipadas com energia renovável (dependendo do colectado).Todas as unidades serão equipadas com água e electricidade, casa de banho separada (chuveiro e WC).



Proyectos futuros:


 

Piscina (reparação) e filtros de água salgada. Caldeira de aquecimento com “pellets” confeccionados a partir de folhas e ramos da nossa floresta. Construir gerador com base na cascata de água para fornecer eletricidade para as unidades. Área de árvores frutíferas (árvores frutíferas serão plantadas por doações cuja recompensa seja patrocinar uma árvore).

AS RECOMPENSAS APENAS PODEM SER PUBLICADAS NUM SÓ IDIOMA

TREEHOUSE TOURISM

A place where nature is the protagonist. With the inspiration of a magical landscape, taking care in great detail the environmental impact. These treehouses are designed to blend in with the forest without damaging it, where trees do not suffer with the buildings and for interior it is used recycled woods .



Our story:  


This is us, Juan y Karina,a young couple who have left many things behind (home, jobs, friends, country) to bet on this dream.
 We love nature and we firmly believe we can enjoy it without damaging it. Leaving aside mass tourism and focusing on a more eco-friendly tourism. One day, tired of our routine and in full existential crisis, we decided to find a house anywhere in the world to meditate and organize our ideas. So we found this place in northern Portugal, which we had never heard of, we were surprised by its natural beauty and peace. How can you not love a place like this?  Thus began our idea ... .How to share this feeling with others?



The idea:


 

Starting from that point and with the illusion of having found a magical and unexplored place, we have created and believed in this idea: Build a set of 5 cabins in the trees, help us to make it happen!.



What we need:

 

The project is already approved by the local Hall, we have the license to build and the architectural designs are all ready to get it started. We just need your support to raise € 16,500 to build our first treehouse.



Our goal is to build a total of 5 treehouses, with the intention of 
promoting small scale eco-conscious tourism based on enjoying nature 
respectfully and with special care to the environment. 
The construction start date is scheduled for 10.02.2016 once completed crowdfunding campaign. The duration of construction is 45 days per house aprox, which we hope to have everything ready to open in May 2016. 
We've decided to do a phased budget as for every € 16,500 collected we could build a tree house with a maximum of 5.
Our
 crowdfunding campaign is FIXED ""all or nothing"", this means that 
donations will be effective only if we get to reach our first target: € 16,500. Otherwise, all contributions will be returned in a 100%. Since we will not have access to the money until this campaign is not finished and the goal achieved.
Our location:
Our coordinates:  41˚38' 56'' N – 8˚ 10' 33'' W
We are situated at the north of Portugal in the concelho of Vieira do Minho. In a national ecological reserve due to its wealth of fauna and flora, next to the Peneda Geres National Park (only national park in Portugal shared with the north of Spain) area. From our location we are ocasional surprised by deers, wild horses and a great variety of birds among which are ..the kite, buzzard, eagle owl, hawk and Whinchat among others. All this with the lake of Caniçada as background. It is a strategic location situated in the middle of nature but with the convenience of the proximity of cities like Braga, Porto and Vigo.
 

A good starting point to explore many points of interest in the surrounding area. With endless water and land sports like trekking, kayaking, canyoning, climbing, abseiling, horse riding, fishing, etc.

We have decided to return to our land to promote it and enhance it through our skills. We have experience in tourism, communication, travel and human relationships with customers. We master languages, social networks and our territory, but above all we deeply love the Dolomites.We want to make this incredible and little known valley known all over the world. We believe that once you have visited these places it is impossible to forget them. Up to now, effective marketing tourism and promotion of this territory have been completely missed. This is causing a slow but unstoppable depopulation. We want to offer to young people the opportunity to continue living in this area.  We can give to the tourists and travelers the key to discover this corner of paradise.With your help we can create a unique project, able to promote this wonderful valley internationally. We can let visitors from all over the world know about these places. We can leave them speechless. Together, we can increase employment for many local businesses and thus encourage young people to open new accommodation facilities and launch new business initiatives.(ITA) Siamo 3 giovani che dopo aver viaggiato a lungo in giro per il mondo, hanno deciso di tornare nella loro terra per promuoverla e valorizzarla attraverso le proprie competenze. Abbiamo esperienza nel turismo, nella comunicazione, nei viaggi e nei rapporti umani con i clienti. Conosciamo le lingue, i social network e il nostro territorio, ma soprattutto amiamo profondamente le Dolomiti.Vogliamo far conoscere a tutto il mondo questa valle incredibile e poco conosciuta. Riteniamo che una volta visitati questi posti sia impossibile dimenticarli. Fino ad oggi, sono mancate completamente azioni efficaci di marketing turistico e promozione di questo territorio che, a poco a poco, si sta spopolando. Noi vogliamo dare ai giovani la possibilità di continuare a vivere nei nostri paesi e ai turisti e viaggiatori la chiave per scoprire questo angolo di paradiso.Con il Vostro aiuto possiamo creare un progetto unico nel suo genere, in grado di promuovere a livello internazionale questa valle stupenda. Possiamo far conoscere ai visitatori di tutto il mondo questi posti che lasciano chiunque senza parole. Insieme, possiamo dare lavoro a tantissime realtà del territorio, incentivare così i giovani ad aprire nuove strutture ricettive e lanciare nuove iniziative imprenditoriali.(ENG) We would like to raise at least € 30,000 to run our start-up and offer a level of tourist experience to our supporters. An effective and professional website (€ 5,000), an info-point as a point of receipt and promotion (€ 10,000), paper and digital promotional materials (€ 5,000), participation in trade shows (€ 8,000), promotions on social media (€ 2,000) are needed to start.You will have the opportunity, with our support, to live an experience that will allow you to spend a week-end or a week of sport, relaxation, love and culture in an incredible place that will leave you speechless and with indelible memories! The prices of packages (perks) are promotional, exclusive and discounted only for you and only during the time of this campaign.Without achieving the goal, we will give up our project. We will return to everyone the amount invested.(ITA) Vorremmo raccogliere almeno € 30.000 per avviare al nostra start-up e offrire un’esperienza turistica di livello ai nostri sostenitori. Un sito web efficace e professionale (€ 5.000), un info-point come punto di ricevimento e promozione (€ 10.000), materiali promozionali cartacei e digitali (€ 5.000), partecipazioni a fiere del settore (€ 8.000), promozioni sui social media (€ 2.000).Avrete la possibilità, con il nostro sostegno, di vivere un’esperienza che vi permetterà di passare un week-end o una settimana all’insegna dello sport, del relax, dell’amore e della cultura in un territorio incredibile che vi lascerà senza parole e con dei ricordi indelebili! I prezzi dei pacchetti (premi) sono promozionali, esclusivi e scontati rispetto i prezzi di listino che in futuro offriremo ai turisti.Senza il raggiungimento dell’obiettivo rinunciamo a lanciare il nostro progetto. In tal caso restituiremo a tutti quanto investito.(ENG) With your contribution you will help our land and at the same time you will give yourself a unique experience at a special price.Every year 70 million travelers visit Venice which is only one hour's drive from here. We are convinced that with the right promotion targeted, at least 2-3% of them will decide to visit our land. We are talking of 1,5-2 million visitors per year and a turnover of ca. 350 million euros. We are talking about a very small part of travelers already in the area that with little effort could come to know and then promote our beautiful territory. With your help, we can build a future for this valley and you can be among the first to use our services (discounted and limited offers).(ITA) Con il tuo contributo aiuterai la nostra terra e contemporaneamente ti regalerai un’esperienza unica a un prezzo speciale.Ogni anno 70 milioni di viaggiatori visitano Venezia che si trova a solamente 1 ora di strada da qui.

Stiamo parlando di 1,5-2 milioni di visitatori all’anno per un fatturato di ca. 350 milioni di Euro. Stiamo parlando di una piccolissima parte di viaggiatori già presenti in zona che con poco sforzo potrebbero venire a conoscere e poi promuovere i nostri territori incantevoli.

outdoor activities just like anyone else.

</span></b><b>When can I choose
the design of my Seizon™ bottle?</b></p>
<p>We

<p><b>3.<span> 
</span></b><b>What’s the material
Seizon™ made of?</b></p>
<p>We
choose  EastmanTritan® special grade co-polyester resin that is non-toxic, BPA-free and can

baby milk bottles and premium water bottles.</p>
<p><b>4.<span>

quality.</p>
<p><b>8.<span>

<p>The

</div></div>","We love to bike and do
outdoor activities just like anyone else. However, carrying our personal belongings in one place is a challenge.  We end up carrying pouches, water bottle, bags and essential kits in a disorganized way. Hence we set our sights on completely changing the way people carrying their belongings and water on the go with greater convenience.  This is why Seizon™ is born.
Seizon™ is patent pending design for its dual-compartment to store your personal essentials in the bottom and drinking water in the top. Comes in aesthetically pleasing graphics, its ergonomically designed bottle shape provides better grip and fits perfectly into bike cages or backpacks' pocket.  We choose made-in-USA Eastman Tritan™ co-polyester material, normally found in premium sports bottles, for its durability, BPA and odor free. It's leak-proof design  keeps your essentials clean and dry. Seizon™ is a testimony to the inventive utilization of space and design in what would otherwise be a run-of-the-mill sports water bottle.
We received a government award for R&D, thus helping us to refine the design to its maximum capabilities in lightness, size and durability.
Its not just unique. Its multi-functional. Its
essential!  Everyone LOVED it!
And now we are ready to share it with YOU!

<li>
<strong>Marketing, Marketing, Marketing</strong> - as we said, the only way this really works is to have lots of beds in lots of places, so we have to continually spread the word, both pre and post launch.  Roller derby has a pretty steady stream of new players and fans, so we'll have to do whatever we can to keep getting the word out. Our future marketing plans include a booth and ad's at RollerCon, airing a video (produced by HitSquad TV!!) during WFTDA playoffs and championships, and attending as many tournaments and gatherings as we can.  We will also create fundraiser marketing packets to send to teams to help them promote it with their fans (teams get 10% back on membership dues when their team is listed at sign-up)!</li>
<li>
<strong>Technology</strong> – Our top priorities that we develop a user friendly site that is secure. Phase 1 of the launch will include search and filtering functions, a user ratings system, a way for members to safely communicate with one another through the site to arrange the stays, and a database full of profiles, pictures, and information about each member. Phase 2 will include event listings, and bout coordination tools.     </li>
</ul><p>​<strong>Membership Levels</strong></p><p>We will offer two membership levels:</p><p><strong>​Traveler and Host - $20 per year</strong>.  This means that you want to use the service when you travel, and that you are willing to offer space to others when they travel.  The accommodations must be clean, safe, and accurately represented in your profile.  A living room floor with space for an air-mattress is perfectly acceptable, as long as that is how you list it on your profile.  We really encourage as many people as possible to agree to host, as the only way the site will be successful is if we have lots of places for people to stay everywhere they go.</p><p><strong>Traveler Only - $50 per year</strong>.  We understand that some people just don’t have the space or circumstances to offer accommodations, but don’t want them to totally miss out on being able to travel more for derby, so we have made the Traveler Only option available at a higher cost. </p><p><i><strong>​We do have a give back to derby policy – every team listed as the affiliate team will receive 10% of the membership dues.  They don’t even have to ask – we will just send it! </strong></i></p><h3> </h3><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>How You Can Help </strong></h2><h3><u>Join or Contribute NOW!</u></h3><p>Show your interest in the project by <strong>pre-purchasing your membership now</strong>.  After the campaign closes, we will contact you to start working on getting your account set up and building your profile.  Your one year membership will not start until the actual website, <a href=""http://www.DoMoreDerby.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.DoMoreDerby.com</a>, is fully launched.  If we don't meet our Indiegogo goal, all funds will be returned to you.</p><h3><u><strong>Share!

Indiegogo has some great sharing tools – check them out! Share it on your social media accounts, on your team’s website, group boards, and tell everyone at practice.  Tell your families and friends who travel for derby.  Tell other teams in your area.  I need you and a whole lot of other people to be a part of this community so we can all help each other!  (Remember, if my campaign goals are reached – 10% of the membership dues will be sent to whatever team each member claims as their affiliate team!)</p></div>","About Me and Do More Derby (www.DoMoreDerby.com)

​Membership LevelsWe will offer two membership levels:​Traveler and Host - $20 per year.  This means that you want to use the service when you travel, and that you are willing to offer space to others when they travel.  The accommodations must be clean, safe, and accurately represented in your profile.  A living room floor with space for an air-mattress is perfectly acceptable, as long as that is how you list it on your profile.  We really encourage as many people as possible to agree to host, as the only way the site will be successful is if we have lots of places for people to stay everywhere they go.Traveler Only - $50 per year.  We understand that some people just don’t have the space or circumstances to offer accommodations, but don’t want them to totally miss out on being able to travel more for derby, so we have made the Traveler Only option available at a higher cost. ​We do have a give back to derby policy – every team listed as the affiliate team will receive 10% of the membership dues.  They don’t even have to ask – we will just send it!  How You Can Help Join or Contribute NOW!Show your interest in the project by pre-purchasing your membership now.  After the campaign closes, we will contact you to start working on getting your account set up and building your profile.  Your one year membership will not start until the actual website, www.DoMoreDerby.com, is fully launched.  If we don't meet our Indiegogo goal, all funds will be returned to you.Share! Share! Share!Please consider helping to fund this project, and more importantly, please share this with as many people as you can who you think would enjoy and benefit from this service. Indiegogo has some great sharing tools – check them out! Share it on your social media accounts, on your team’s website, group boards, and tell everyone at practice.  Tell your families and friends who travel for derby.  Tell other teams in your area.  I need you and a whole lot of other people to be a part of this community so we can all help each other!  (Remember, if my campaign goals are reached – 10% of the membership dues will be sent to whatever team each member claims as their affiliate team!)",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

Parce que les obstacles sur leur chemin, malgré les stabilisateurs standards, ne sont pas suffisant pour éviter la perte d'équilibre et les chutes.Nous avons développé une solution efficace de stabilisateurs pour améliorer la sécurité des enfants, et assurer votre sérénité !Ce système breveté, complètement mécanique, remplace les stabilisateurs traditionnels de chaque côté des roues arrières du vélo. Des mouvements alternatifs de montées et descentes des roues compensent et absorbent tous les obstacles que votre enfant rencontre sur son chemin. La bicyclette reste droite, sans déport.  Avec des stabilisateurs traditionnels, qui n'ont qu'une seule roue de chaque côté, le passage dans ou sur un obstacle, provoque le déport du vélo. Il perd sa perpendicularité et l'enfant perd l'équilibre.Ce phénomène est aggravé par la posture de l'enfant qui, en se penchant involontairement de part et d'autre, déplace son centre de gravité. La conjonction des deux phénomènes conduit souvent à une chute.Avec JustED, chaque roulette en déplacement provoque le blocage de l'autre en position neutre. Ce qui assure une parfaite stabilité de la bicyclette.​ La taille du vélo est déterminée par celle de votre enfant ainsi que par son âge. Afin de faciliter son apprentissage et son épanouissement, il est primordial que votre enfant évolue sur un vélo à sa taille. Ainsi, les stabilisateurs JustED sont conçus pour être montés sur des bicyclettes de 8 jusqu'à 14 pouces pour couvrir toute la gamme de tailles standards.Vous pourrez installer le système soit sur l'axe de la roue arrière, soit sur les perçages existants, selon le modèle de vélo. Toutes les instructions nécessaires seront livrées avec le système.Pour un montage plus rapide vous pouvez également acheter notre clé JustED. Cette clé remplacera toute vos clés de différentes tailles pour un montage plus facile.Les coques extérieures sont fabriquées en PC/ABS (Polycarbonate/Acrylonitrile Butadiène Styrène). Une combinaison unique de la haute transformabilité de l‘ABS avec les excellentes propriétés mécaniques, de résistance aux chocs et à la chaleur du PC.Les leviers intérieurs sont en Polyamide 6 chargé 20% fibre de carbone. Le polymère à renfort fibre de carbone ou PRFC est un matériau composite très résistant et léger.Les pièces métalliques sont en acier type acier de construction non allié S300PB à usinabilité améliorée étiré à froid. Elles sont protégées de la corrosion par un traitement électrolytique.Nous avons choisi de produire JustED en France, pour avoir un meilleur contrôle de la qualité et des délais de livraison.JustED est un système breveté et a reçu plusieurs récompenses : Pour soutenir ce projet et faire de celui ci une réalité vous pouvez soit pré§commander notre système JustED, ou faire un don libre. Pour ce faire, remonter en haut de cette page et cliquez soit sur une des contreparties à droite de la page, soit sur ""soutenir ce projet"" et insérez le montant que vous voulez donner.Tous les prix des contreparties incluent les frais de port. Le prototype final a été testé et approuvé. La phase de production est déjà planifiée et prête à être lancée. Nous avons besoin de 135,000$ pour enter dans la phase de production et financer le premier lot de produits. Vos pré-commandes nous permettront de lancer la machine. Si vous avez la moindre question, écrivez à  : contact@justed.fr  Because roads and paths taken by your kids while they are learning to ride a bike are not always billiard tables. Because the obstacles on their way, despite the standard stabilizers wheels, are not enough to avoid the loss of balance and falls...We developed an efficient solution of stabilizers to improve the security of your kids, and ensuring your serenity !This patented device, completely mechanical, replaces the traditional stabilizers on both sides of the back wheel of the bicycle. Alternative movements of ups and downs of the wheels compensate and absorb all the obstacles your kid meet on his path. The bicycle remains straight.   With traditional stabilizers, including only one wheel, the passage, on or in, an obstacle generates bicycle offset. It loses its perpendicularity and leads to destabilize the child.This phenomenon is increased by the posture of the child which, by bending involuntarily on both sides, moves its center of gravity. The conjunction of both phenomena often leads to a fall.With JustED Security, each moving wheels causes the blocking of the other one in a neutral position. That insures a perfect stability of the bicycle. The size of the bike is defined by the size of your child as well as by its age. To facilitate his learning process and its self-fulfillment, it is essential that your child evolves on a bike that fits his size. That is why JustED stabilizers are designed to fit bicycles from 8 to 14 inches, to cover all the range of standard sizes.You will be able to install the system or on the axis of the rear wheel or on the existing drilling, depending on the bicycle model. All the instructions and necessary pieces will be delivered with the system.For an easier assembly you can also purchase the JustED key. This key replaces all the keys of different sizes and will provide you with an easier assembly experience. The outer shells are made of PC ABS. The PC/ABS (Polycarbonate / Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) is a unique combination of the ABS high workability, with the PC excellent mechanical properties, impact and heat resistance.The inner levers are made of Polyamide 6 with 20% carbon fiber. The Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) is a very resistant and lightweight composite material.The metal parts are made of steel type S300PB non-alloy construction steel with enhanced cold stretching 11SMNPB37. It is protected from corrosion by electrolytic treatment.We chose to produce JustED in France, to have a better control on the product quality and on the delivery time.JustED is a patented system and it won multiple awards :  To support this project and make it real you can either pre-order our JustED system, or just donate the amount of money you want. To do so, scroll up on this page and click either on one of the rewards on the right side, or on ""support this project"".All the prices includes the shipping.   The final prototype has been tested and approved. The production stage is already set up and ready to go. We need 135,000$ to enter the production stage and finance the first batch of products.

The many features listed above make the Igloo Houses a wonderful place to spend a relaxing holiday surrounded by the beautiful nature of Lapland. Another feature that makes the Igloo Houses special is their <strong>mobility</strong>. For example, if clouds prevent viewing the <strong>Northern Lights</strong>, the accommodation can be moved to where the skies are clear. For an additional cost we can change your location, if you so desire.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">CAMPAIGN IN A NUTSHELL</h3>
<p><strong>About ourselves</strong></p>
<p><br/>We are Tanja Hyväri and Timo Tapaninen - tourism entrepreneurs from Finnish Lapland. For the past two years our company LaplandNews has been focusing on travel marketing. Among other things, we have grown our social media followers to 350 000 and made over 120 videos about Lapland. Now we’ve decided to move on from marketing other holiday attractions to running our own. Our goal is to establish a next generation travel centre called Northern Lights Igloo Resort.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562657225/uxtxmnswnhol5bpivred.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>Tanja Hyväri and Timo Tapaninen in London 2018</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Lapland is a fast growing travel destination</strong></p>
<p>The number of people traveling to Lapland is growing rapidly. Santa Claus, elves, northern lights, reindeer, huskies and all the different snow activities interest people from all over the world. One of the hottest trends right now is arctic glass accommodation, known as a glass igloo. Our goal is to build the travel destination of your dreams here in Lapland, which will include 10 astonishingly beautiful, mobile glass igloo houses, a restaurant serving local and international food and all the popular Lappish program services, provided by us or our partners.</p>
<p><strong>Campaign in Indiegogo</strong><br/><br/>This Indiegogo pre-sale campaign plays a big part in our funding plan. All of you early bird -backers will get a holiday package of your dreams with a 60% discount. You can choose any date during the season in the next three years to be the date of your arrival. After the campaign you will receive an e-mail with a booking code for our booking website. With the code you will get to book your holiday two weeks before our site opens to the general public.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">WHAT DO WE NEED AND OFFER</h3>
<p>We are going to build this resort in any case, but with these pre-orders, we can fund the project better and build higher quality lodging and restaurant. <strong>According to Finnish laws, we can only provide substitutional pre-sales campaigns. We do not accept any charitable donations.</strong><br/><br/>Northern Lights Igloo Resort is a perfect travel destination for people seeking peace, safety, visuality, beautiful pictures and showstopping videos. We know that you too would love the opportunity to see the beauty of the northern lights at this amazing location. Guests at the resort can enjoy local food along with a taste of international cuisine at the Northern Lights Restaurant, in which you will have the opportunity to meet the local culture. At the resort you will be able to experience all favorite activities that Lapland has to offer, such as meeting Santa Claus and his elves, going on a husky ride, riding snowmobiles and visiting the reindeer. These activities are available for purchase here on IndieGoGo, on ”Items”-section after choosing your perk. </p>
<p>You will be charged after the campaign only if we have reached our goal.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Some of our available programs</strong></p>

</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">THE IMPACT AND MORE DETAILS</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The growth projectile of Lapland’s tourism seems promising. Annually there are around 3 million visitors to the area with an annual growth of 10%. Respect for nature, sustainable traveling, safety, peace and cleanliness are few of our most important values. This is the case when it comes to our resort as well. Our glass igloo houses will all have solar panels and even though it is dark here during winter, installing and using them is still ecological.</p>
<p>Northern Lights Igloo Resort will start constructions in Autumn 2019 and our goal is to get the resort ready for Christmas 2019. It will be in the proximity of skiing centre Aavasaksa in the municipality of Ylitornio. This peaceful area is away from the light pollution of the city centre but still near the Lappish program services. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Professional team</strong><br/><br/>As a team we are well known in Lapland. We have the second largest number of followers in social media in Lapland and we know how to market. Our team also includes Timo Paulin, who works as a content creator along with Outi Rantaniemi, who is the consultant of our restaurant operations. This lodging project is completely new to us, but we know the Lappish hotels and traveling as an industry well.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>Our building schedule is tight. Although we've already bought the piece of land, and we have made preparations , we have a lot to do before we can welcome our first guests. We have prepared the timeline and gathered help from experts as well. Completing the project in time is possible, otherwise we wouldn’t even aim at being ready this winter season. The fact that the glass igloo -houses and the restaurant are built in a factory and then brought to the resort as ready-made modules, reduces the schedule risks. We are certain that everything will be in order by mid-December 2019.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Project Completion</strong></p>
<p>The progression of this project will be enjoyable for you to follow. You will be able to see our fantastic location being built by receiving video and photo updates. You can also partially influence the materials chosen for the resort. We will be asking for your opinion as the project progresses!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>Other ways to get involved</strong></p>
<p>It is great that you are interested in our project! If you cannot buy a perk, we understand completely. Instead you can help us and the others by letting as many people as possible know about our idea. You could even ask if one of your close friends or family members has ever been to Finland or Lapland or would like to visit this amazing travel destination. One way to share this information is through Indiegogo's own share tools. </p>

</div></div>","INTRODUCING NORTHERN LIGHTS IGLOO RESORT
 
DREAM VACATION IN THE CLEANEST DESTINATION IN THE WORLD
The northern part of Finland, Lapland, has the cleanest nature and air in the world. Pure white snow, glass-igloo -houses with panoramic windows and the restaurant offering local food will make you feel relaxed and savor your holiday in our resort.
 
MOBILE GLASS-IGLOO -HOUSES PROVIDE YOU WITH STUNNING VIEWS
We have ten wonderful glass-igloo -houses in our resort, where you can enjoy the beauty of Lapland in an unforgettable way. They can house two adults and two school aged children. The houses include following features.

Bedroom with panoramic windows, roof window and motorized bed.
Living room with cozy fireplace and sofa bed
Kitchen with stove, microwave oven, table and utensils.
Sauna, WC and bathroom
Underfloor heating
Heated windows
Quality furniture
Privacy, tranquillity and safety

The Igloo House is more than just an igloo. It is like a small house, which has a lot of room. The many features listed above make the Igloo Houses a wonderful place to spend a relaxing holiday surrounded by the beautiful nature of Lapland. Another feature that makes the Igloo Houses special is their mobility. For example, if clouds prevent viewing the Northern Lights, the accommodation can be moved to where the skies are clear. For an additional cost we can change your location, if you so desire.
 
RESTAURANT SERVING LOCAL FOOD AND INTERNATIONAL CUISINES
Northern Lights Restaurant serves our guest by offering three delicious buffets each day: breakfast, lunch and dinner. Our selection includes local meals mixed with international flavors. The restaurant building also acts as the reception of our resort, open 24/7.
 
WIDE SELECTION OF HIGH-QUALITY PROGRAM SERVICES
Our resort offers you a chance to enjoy all the popular program services such as meeting Santa Claus, riding a husky sled, driving a snowmobile, ice fishing and visiting a reindeer ranch. All activities are first-class and available at an affordable price. 
The prices of the perks include one reservation for a glass igloo, which can house two adults and two children. If the perks include program services or the all-inclusive package, they are for everyone lodging in the same house, meaning max. 2 adults and 2 children.

 
CAMPAIGN IN A NUTSHELL
About ourselves
We are Tanja Hyväri and Timo Tapaninen - tourism entrepreneurs from Finnish Lapland. For the past two years our company LaplandNews has been focusing on travel marketing. Among other things, we have grown our social media followers to 350 000 and made over 120 videos about Lapland. Now we’ve decided to move on from marketing other holiday attractions to running our own. Our goal is to establish a next generation travel centre called Northern Lights Igloo Resort.

Tanja Hyväri and Timo Tapaninen in London 2018
 
Lapland is a fast growing travel destination
The number of people traveling to Lapland is growing rapidly. Santa Claus, elves, northern lights, reindeer, huskies and all the different snow activities interest people from all over the world. One of the hottest trends right now is arctic glass accommodation, known as a glass igloo. Our goal is to build the travel destination of your dreams here in Lapland, which will include 10 astonishingly beautiful, mobile glass igloo houses, a restaurant serving local and international food and all the popular Lappish program services, provided by us or our partners.
Campaign in IndiegogoThis Indiegogo pre-sale campaign plays a big part in our funding plan. All of you early bird -backers will get a holiday package of your dreams with a 60% discount. You can choose any date during the season in the next three years to be the date of your arrival. After the campaign you will receive an e-mail with a booking code for our booking website. With the code you will get to book your holiday two weeks before our site opens to the general public.

 
 

WHAT DO WE NEED AND OFFER
We are going to build this resort in any case, but with these pre-orders, we can fund the project better and build higher quality lodging and restaurant. According to Finnish laws, we can only provide substitutional pre-sales campaigns. We do not accept any charitable donations.Northern Lights Igloo Resort is a perfect travel destination for people seeking peace, safety, visuality, beautiful pictures and showstopping videos. We know that you too would love the opportunity to see the beauty of the northern lights at this amazing location. Guests at the resort can enjoy local food along with a taste of international cuisine at the Northern Lights Restaurant, in which you will have the opportunity to meet the local culture. At the resort you will be able to experience all favorite activities that Lapland has to offer, such as meeting Santa Claus and his elves, going on a husky ride, riding snowmobiles and visiting the reindeer. These activities are available for purchase here on IndieGoGo, on ”Items”-section after choosing your perk. 
You will be charged after the campaign only if we have reached our goal.
 
Some of our available programs

After you’ve chosen your perk, advance to check-out. There you’ll find all the various activities we offer at a 20% discount. You can pick as many as you like.  After our campaign ends you can buy more activities at any time before your trip and even on a whim when you’re already here, but you won’t get the discount if you buy the activities after the campaign.
 

THE IMPACT AND MORE DETAILS
 
The growth projectile of Lapland’s tourism seems promising. Annually there are around 3 million visitors to the area with an annual growth of 10%. Respect for nature, sustainable traveling, safety, peace and cleanliness are few of our most important values. This is the case when it comes to our resort as well. Our glass igloo houses will all have solar panels and even though it is dark here during winter, installing and using them is still ecological.
Northern Lights Igloo Resort will start constructions in Autumn 2019 and our goal is to get the resort ready for Christmas 2019. It will be in the proximity of skiing centre Aavasaksa in the municipality of Ylitornio. This peaceful area is away from the light pollution of the city centre but still near the Lappish program services. 
 
Professional teamAs a team we are well known in Lapland. We have the second largest number of followers in social media in Lapland and we know how to market. Our team also includes Timo Paulin, who works as a content creator along with Outi Rantaniemi, who is the consultant of our restaurant operations. This lodging project is completely new to us, but we know the Lappish hotels and traveling as an industry well. 
Risks & Challenges

Our building schedule is tight. Although we've already bought the piece of land, and we have made preparations , we have a lot to do before we can welcome our first guests. We have prepared the timeline and gathered help from experts as well. Completing the project in time is possible, otherwise we wouldn’t even aim at being ready this winter season. The fact that the glass igloo -houses and the restaurant are built in a factory and then brought to the resort as ready-made modules, reduces the schedule risks. We are certain that everything will be in order by mid-December 2019.
 
Project Completion
The progression of this project will be enjoyable for you to follow. You will be able to see our fantastic location being built by receiving video and photo updates. You can also partially influence the materials chosen for the resort. We will be asking for your opinion as the project progresses!
 

Other ways to get involved
It is great that you are interested in our project! If you cannot buy a perk, we understand completely. Instead you can help us and the others by letting as many people as possible know about our idea. You could even ask if one of your close friends or family members has ever been to Finland or Lapland or would like to visit this amazing travel destination. One way to share this information is through Indiegogo's own share tools.

<h3>WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT MAKING DRAWSTRING BAGS</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Super Light, slick, versatile and quite affordable</strong>, drawstring bags are perfect choice for minimalists. But current products on market are either way too fancy, or way too simple.</li>
<li>Shouldn't there be a bag that is minimal in functions and appearance, yet <strong>super comfortable and capable of everyday task</strong>? Absolutely!! Hence the Karry bag.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1608027190/imd5ota8fdla4me8y5en.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>THIS IS NOT OUR 1ST RODEO</h3>
<ul>
<li>We have made <strong>many generations of Karry bags</strong>, delivered couple thousands of bags to backers all over the world, and learnt quite a lot from all kinds of mistakes. </li>
<li>Learnt from previous experience, we have re-arranged our supply chain, and we promise, <strong>Karry4.0 will have great quality</strong> just like previous Karry3.0 and Karry2.0. </li>
<li>Also, we had quite some difficulties during the pandemic period, but we are now doing very good, and <strong>we are ready for the new campaign and the fulfillment after</strong> :)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1608027379/gzkzaqd9hfp4jkmyp4zz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our kickstarer campaign was very successful, and most backers have already received their reward with great satisfaction :)</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1608185741/veea0ob1he8xzonvzraz.png"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>MANY NEW FEATURES</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1608029640/ek2ladwhiym26hozy5zu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>We listen to our backers very carefully, including the drawstring rope length issue, so we made new version<strong> Karry4.0 with new adjustable shoulder straps</strong> to meet backers' needs. :)</li>
<li> Detachable gadget bag is a new design feature in the new version, since we find out many backers use Karry bag as weekend bag for family trip, <strong>a handy small pouch</strong> around wrist can be quite nice. :)</li>
<li>And we made the <strong>bag size a bit bigger, </strong>but don't worry, since now the rope length is adjustable, the bigger size won't look saggy. :)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1608031354/zeqlm20lolobhmdbn60h.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>THE WAY DRAWSTRING BAGS SHOULD BE</h3>
<ul><li>People use drawstring bags for many purpose, commute, sports, study. Although many other brands designed their drawstring bags with many cool functions, Karry bag want to return to the <strong>very essential things about drawstring bags: Comfortableness, and functional. </strong>
</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1608031581/imy5vwoms9wxwfeb9zxk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Nylon material</h3>
<ul><li>Karry4.0 bag uses <strong>top quality nylon material</strong>, we have hundreds of backers can back us on this fact. <strong>Light weight, tough against scratch, durable, and pleasing to touch. </strong>
</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1608032807/e8ly7n1th8bynoyzaglz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>Sand proof, and water resistant: If you are using Karry bag as weekend bag, then you may find Karry to be super functional. It is<strong> sand proof</strong>, and doesn't get dirty easily, plus it is <strong>water resistant thanks to back coated layer</strong>.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1608033875/fdozijylbolotek3osdv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>We use <strong>customized thick shoulder ropes</strong>. Thickest in this world, yes we dare to make that claim.  The following image is a simple comparison between common rope on the left and Karry4.0 rope on the right. </li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1608034867/jdf0hxmksq4ihvd0wu3w.jpg"" src=""""/>.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>BEST ROPE FOR BEST DRAWSTRING BAG</h3>
<ul><li>We went out to design Karry4.0 with clear purpose. Nothing fancy like cut proof or anti-blablabla, only the very very basic thing, the very core of the bag, the shoulder rope itself, which is t he only factor dominating the bag's comfortableness.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1608035704/xmorttnljd4d5wc7pz9j.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>Super thick rope: Our customized made shoulder rope is much thicker than the common shoulder ropes used. <strong>World's thickest and most comfortable.</strong> :)</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1608038842/awz8dlgpgial30opadxq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li> Soft stuffing: Yes, there are many other thick ropes as well, but way harder and rigid. <strong>Our ropes are the most cozy ropes there are.</strong>
</li></ul>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<ul><li>One of the most annoying thing about common drawstring bags is the rope sliding problem. Even bags from famous brands like Nike etc. <strong>We fixed the shoulder sliding problem once and for all.</strong> Thanks to our unique rope sheath design. :)</li></ul>

</div></div>","WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT MAKING DRAWSTRING BAGS


Super Light, slick, versatile and quite affordable, drawstring bags are perfect choice for minimalists. But current products on market are either way too fancy, or way too simple.
Shouldn't there be a bag that is minimal in functions and appearance, yet super comfortable and capable of everyday task? Absolutely!! Hence the Karry bag.

 

 
THIS IS NOT OUR 1ST RODEO

We have made many generations of Karry bags, delivered couple thousands of bags to backers all over the world, and learnt quite a lot from all kinds of mistakes. 
Learnt from previous experience, we have re-arranged our supply chain, and we promise, Karry4.0 will have great quality just like previous Karry3.0 and Karry2.0. 
Also, we had quite some difficulties during the pandemic period, but we are now doing very good, and we are ready for the new campaign and the fulfillment after :)

 

 
Our kickstarer campaign was very successful, and most backers have already received their reward with great satisfaction :)

 

MANY NEW FEATURES
 

 

We listen to our backers very carefully, including the drawstring rope length issue, so we made new version Karry4.0 with new adjustable shoulder straps to meet backers' needs. :)
 Detachable gadget bag is a new design feature in the new version, since we find out many backers use Karry bag as weekend bag for family trip, a handy small pouch around wrist can be quite nice. :)
And we made the bag size a bit bigger, but don't worry, since now the rope length is adjustable, the bigger size won't look saggy. :)

 
 

 
THE WAY DRAWSTRING BAGS SHOULD BE
People use drawstring bags for many purpose, commute, sports, study. Although many other brands designed their drawstring bags with many cool functions, Karry bag want to return to the very essential things about drawstring bags: Comfortableness, and functional. 

 


 
 

 
Nylon material
Karry4.0 bag uses top quality nylon material, we have hundreds of backers can back us on this fact. Light weight, tough against scratch, durable, and pleasing to touch. 

 

 
Sand proof, and water resistant: If you are using Karry bag as weekend bag, then you may find Karry to be super functional. It is sand proof, and doesn't get dirty easily, plus it is water resistant thanks to back coated layer.
 

 
We use customized thick shoulder ropes. Thickest in this world, yes we dare to make that claim.  The following image is a simple comparison between common rope on the left and Karry4.0 rope on the right. 
 
.
 
 

 
BEST ROPE FOR BEST DRAWSTRING BAG
We went out to design Karry4.0 with clear purpose. Nothing fancy like cut proof or anti-blablabla, only the very very basic thing, the very core of the bag, the shoulder rope itself, which is t he only factor dominating the bag's comfortableness.
 

 
Super thick rope: Our customized made shoulder rope is much thicker than the common shoulder ropes used. World's thickest and most comfortable. :)
 

 
 Soft stuffing: Yes, there are many other thick ropes as well, but way harder and rigid. Our ropes are the most cozy ropes there are.

 

 
One of the most annoying thing about common drawstring bags is the rope sliding problem. Even bags from famous brands like Nike etc. We fixed the shoulder sliding problem once and for all. Thanks to our unique rope sheath design. :)
 

 
As a new feature, we introduced adjustable shoulder straps to fit different height and weight of different backers, and big thank you to all the backers who have been giving us valuable feedback. :)
 

 
 

 
INTUITIVE POCKETS

Private back pocket: The back pocket on Karry4.0 can be used for instant access for smart phones, power bank, wallet, passport, etc. Any thing flat and important. Super intuitive :)
 

 

 

Karry4.0 bag also has two side zipper pockets for smaller items.
One of the side zipper pocket is bigger, and deep enough for a common water bottle.

 

 
One of the side zipper pocket is smaller, perfect for items like keys or wallet. It designed to be smaller such that users don't have to dig around.
 

 
Karry4.0 bag has two inner zipper pockets, one is attached to the bag, the other one is detachable, and it can be paired with the handle and turn into a nice hand bag. :)
 

 
 Quite spacy: You can fit 13inch laptop, notebook, outfits, many more stuff into Karry bag. Super roomy :)
 

 
 

 
Karry4.0 comes with a small gadget bag can be hooked inside or hanging out the bag. Plus, it can be used as an individual hand bag, super convenient. :) 
 
Use gadget bag from outside

Hang out the gadget bag from outside like a little cap for more instant access. Perfect for storing glasses, ear bugs and etc.
 

 

 
Use gadget bag from inside  
The detachable gadget bag can be installed inside the bag with the hook, to be used as an inner pocket.

 

 
Use as a hand bag

The gadget bag can also be completely removed from the bag, pair with the handle belt to be used as an individual hang bag, if you don't want to carry the whole bag, 
 

 
It can even be considered as a wallet pouch or a purse. Minimal, super light, and quite functional.
 

 

 
 
ELASTIC CORDS
When we go out, we might have some extra stuff to carry. Something bulky like a ball, a helmet; something wet and smelly, like shoes, wet towels. 
 

 

Karry bag comes with Elastic cord to handle this problem, now you can bring a blanket, slipper, shoes, ball, towel etc.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>As a long-time enthusiast who collects mountain bikes from the period during which my love for cycling eventually became my career, I routinely uncover new finds from the 80s &amp; 90s which are well worth restoring and riding, but whose tires are beyond saving.</p>
<p>Light-colored sidewalls which contrast black tread rubber are back in fashion, and we're lucky enough to have access to modern production of a couple classic MTB tire designs from the 90s, but I realized that no currently available tire incorporates the following design elements which ideally suit earlier mountain bikes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Large, tall, simply-shaped tread elements<ul><li>The 80s called, and they're bringing big blocks back</li></ul>
</li>
<li>A slightly directional, but not position-specific, tread pattern<ul><li>Use the same tire both front &amp; rear; a simple flip changes the grip</li></ul>
</li>
<li>A round tire profile<ul><li>Consistent cornering control over all surfaces, from soft through hard</li></ul>
</li>
<li>No graphics printed on the beige, 120TPI sidewalls<ul><li>How much more beige could they be? The answer is none - none more beige</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Folding, yet not tubeless-compatible, beads<ul><li>The only thing harder than mounting a tubeless tire to a vintage rim is removing it</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1579443810/ngonzvnqo8fisvk6yog6.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Thanks to more than twenty years experience in bicycle product development, including developing custom tire designs for other brands with several tire manufacturers, I realized I was in a unique position to solve this problem.</p>
<p>I created my brand, Terra One, to help fellow vintage cycling enthusiasts preserve our history, build our community, and ride more frequently. The RIDER T1 tire is the first product which fully embraces those goals; a new tire for our original, off-road legends.</p>
<p>Your support of this crowdfunding campaign will ensure that the first production quantities of the RIDER T1 are efficiently delivered around the world, that a second production order can be  placed before the first one is shipped, and that molds to create the second Terra One tire design are opened as quickly as possible. Thank you!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1579442892/liiv0ylzkryhbz0y0r5o.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where the Project Stands</h3>
<ul>
<li>The RIDER T1 design was completed together with Vee Tire Co. in Thailand</li>
<li>Molds have been cut in their factory</li>
<li>Twenty prototypes, in five different versions, have been made, measured &amp; ride-tested</li>
<li>Tooling revisions have been executed to more precisely manufacture the design</li>
<li>Initial production specifications have been confirmed, based on testing &amp; feedback</li>
<li>Quality control standards have been agreed upon</li>
<li>A first order for 1,000 tires has been placed</li>
<li>A shipping date for this initial order has been provided</li>
</ul>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1579443980/zpfa20sydqvnhqdufspc.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<h3><strong>What Terra One Needs</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Where should the first 1,000 tires be shipped?<ul>
<li>It doesn't make sense to ship all the tires from Thailand to Switzerland first </li>
<li>The order can be split into bulk shipments to the countries with the strongest demand<ul>
<li>Early supporters will receive their tires sooner</li>
<li>Shipping costs will be lower</li>
<li>Reduced chances of import duties due upon receipt</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is support for the first Terra One tire strong enough to justify a second model right away?<ul><li>Once we reach the first stretch goal, I will fast-track the next Terra One tire<ul>
<li>Reveal the model name and design to supporters</li>
<li>Spend funds raised to create the tooling needed to produce prototype tires</li>
<li>Plan a new campaign to launch the second Terra One tire model</li>
</ul>
</li></ul>
</li>
<li>How many tires should be ordered for the second production of the RIDER T1?<ul><li>Feedback to date indicates that my first order of 1,000 tires should quickly sell out<ul>
<li>Measuring campaign demand will determine the right size for a second order</li>
<li>The funds raised will allow me to place the second order before the first one ships</li>
<li>If we reach the second stretch goal, I will add a second RIDER T1 specification</li>
</ul>
</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>What Supporters Will Receive</strong></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1579444100/ko3pprpfggedq8arbu9b.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The primary perk for this campaign is the RIDER T1: a new tire for our original, off-road legends. The initial production will be manufactured in a single specification as follows:</p>
<p>Size:                                     26 x 2.125</p>
<p>ETRTO:                               54-559</p>
<p>Measured Width:            56.5mm, at max pressure, on a 21mm rim (inner width)</p>
<p>Bead:                                  Folding</p>
<p>Tread Color:                      Black</p>
<p>Rubber:                              Dual compound (56 Shore A center with 48 Shore A sides)</p>
<p>Sidewall Color:                Beige</p>
<p>Casing:                               120 TPI</p>
<p>Target Weight:                 750g ± 30g</p>
<p>Inflation:                            22 - 50 PSI / 1.6 – 3.5 bar</p>
<p>Tire Type:                          Tubed</p>
<p>For those who pre-order the RIDER T1 through this campaign, I will include additional Terra One merchandise at no charge to properly thank you for your strong support. Since I don't want to dilute the value of my new tires by discounting their price before the first pair has been sold, the more tires you buy, the more Terra One swag you'll receive: for example, this hooded sweatshirt, printed by Bike Ninja UK. Thanks in advance for helping promote my new brand.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1580116912/hejxyumnitdl0sycnfem.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>If you'd like to ensure a bright future for Terra One, but funds are too tight right now, I can also offer you this same merchandise at levels of support below the price of a pair of tires.</p>
<p>And if you commit to exceptional support of Terra One's goals, I'll invite you to visit me in Switzerland to spend a couple days living them with me: preserving history by tracking down hidden treasures to add to your collection, building community by meeting fellow vintage MTB enthusiasts and enjoying their collections, and naturally, riding as much as we can.</p>
<h3><strong>What Happens if the Campaign isn't Fully Funded?</strong></h3>
<p>Terra One is built to last. This crowdfunding campaign is intended to help me more fully achieve its goals, and more quickly serve the needs of passionate vintage cycling enthusiasts who want products beyond the RIDER T1, but its long-term future isn't entirely dependent on the short-term results of this campaign.</p>
<p>Terra One has committed funds to pay for the initial production run of 1,000 RIDER T1 tires. In the unlikely event that we don't reach the campaign's primary goal together, these tires will still be produced and sold, but likely shipped from Switzerland or Europe at higher total costs than through this campaign.</p>
<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
<p>If we reach the first stretch goal of CHF 40,000 together, I will open molds for a second Terra One tire model, the design of which has been influenced by early feedback from supporters, both in person and on social media.</p>
<p>If we reach the second stretch goal of CHF 60,000 together, I will develop one additional specification of the RIDER T1, to be produced in a future order. Black sidewalls? Additional puncture protection? Colored tread rubber? You can help decide its future by supporting this campaign now.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>About Pricing</h3>
<p>Now that I'm managing my own brand, I'm determined to not make mistakes which I've seen too many times during my 20+ years on the supply side of the bicycle business. I intend for Terra One to act responsibly and consistently, so fair, stable pricing is important.</p>
<ul>
<li>Core product value built on design, quality, performance &amp; longevity<ul>
<li>I aim to create timeless, classic products, which won't need to be updated often</li>
<li>No high suggested retail prices paired with deeply discounted everyday prices</li>
<li>All campaign discounts come in the form of no-charge promotional items<ul><li>The base price of CHF/USD 100 per pair should remain stable over time</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>No online price wars between giant, global discounters<ul>
<li>Consumer-direct sales during each product's initial launch phase</li>
<li>Later, a limited number of like-minded, long-term retail partners who share my goals<ul>
<li>Museums which preserve our history and inspire new passion for old MTBs</li>
<li>Retailers which repair and restore vintage bikes, helping build our community</li>
<li>Organizations which hold events that bring us together to ride more frequently</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A small, independent company, free of investor pressure and corporate politics<ul>
<li>No outside influence pushing for constant growth &amp; quarterly return on investment</li>

<h3>More Detailed Background</h3>
<p><strong>OUR SHARED GOALS</strong></p>
<p>Ever since he has been old enough to express his opinions, Jeremias Walter Malone has insisted that he work side-by-side with his father when he grows up. I founded Terra One in July 2019 to ensure that years from now, we can make his dream a reality.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1580117362/fuxaf9p1ewigdzi9tdat.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Terra One is a Swiss company, focused on product design, development, production and distribution in the bicycle and e-mobility sectors. In addition to consulting for other companies and brands, Terra One will also distribute its own products.</p>
<p>As a balance to my recent professional efforts to develop e-bikes for premium Swiss brands, I began to study, collect and restore “me-bikes”: notable road and mountain bicycles from the 1980s and 1990s, the period during which cycling transitioned from my hobby to my career.</p>
<p>The initial products sold under the Terra One brand will be inspired by my experiences in vintage cycling. My goals are to allow like-minded individuals to ride more frequently, preserve our history, and build a strong global community. Jeremias and I welcome you to come along for the ride!</p>
<p><strong>RIDE MORE FREQUENTLY</strong></p>
<p>Most of us ride our classics to enjoy free time exploring the outdoors, and to improve our mental and physical well-being. Then why risk flats, crashes, and long walks home by riding on old tires with age-hardened treads &amp; dried-out casings?</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1580118990/mzjjtwdm6gzdd7thtfih.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The more confidence you have in your equipment, the fewer excuses you'll have to not go for a ride. This is especially important when you're fortunate enough to be riding with fellow fanatics. None of us wants to be the one holding up a long-awaited group ride with friends while improvising a field-expedient repair on a tire which has exceeded its service life.</p>
<p><strong>PRESERVE OUR HISTORY</strong></p>
<p>Tire manufacturers aren’t making any more MTB tires from the 1980s. Let’s reserve the few examples that remain for static display in museums and at shows, and mount up fresh RIDER T1 tires before we roll out to the trails.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1580119032/wxvywxgc6jorzpvtzeyf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Even if thirty year old tires look good enough to ride, their age represents a risk to your beloved vintage mountain bikes, as well as to your health. Sidewalls dry out and deteriorate. The oils which keep rubber fresh and compliant leach out from the tread rubber. Don’t risk crashes which risk the condition of your classics or your own well-being; save old tires for show, and use Terra One tires to go!</p>
<p><strong>BUILD OUR COMMUNITY</strong></p>
<p>Terra One supports organizations which keep the legacy of mountain biking alive, including, but not limited to, the Mountainbike Museum in the Netherlands, the International Mountain Bike Hall of Fame in California, and Génération Mountainbike in France.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1580119078/d1xvzaldu5pf8hsrcepr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>In addition, Terra One will contribute to, and participate in, events which bring us together as enthusiasts, and will support them in their efforts to attract, educate &amp; infatuate the public with the vintage bikes we love. I look forward to meeting you at such an event soon. </p>
<p><strong>MY EXPERIENCE</strong></p>
<p>1983: Learned how the right choice of rubber can transform a bike when a pair of CyclePro Snakebelly tires with beige sidewalls gave me and my stripped-down Stingray instant BMX credibility around (and slightly above) my neighborhood.</p>
<p>1987: Survived my first mountain bike adventure in Winter Park Colorado together with my brother: three hours and 15 minutes of oxygen deprived climbing, followed by 45 minutes of white-knuckle descending to return the bikes we had rented for the afternoon.</p>
<p>1991: Tried a set of black sidewall tires on my second mountain bike, and didn’t like the way they looked together with hard-anodized rims. I went back to beige sidewalls until my fourth MTB two years later, which was equipped with silver rims.</p>
<p>1998: Developed the Pathfinder, a 26” multi-terrain tire, together with Cheng Shin Tire. A red-striped version was featured on my full-suspension, Diamondback concept bikes for a Shimano showcase at Interbike, while a black sidewall version was specified on their Wildwood and Voyager models soon after. Sadly, beige sidewall versions of this tire were only available in the aftermarket for a very short time.</p>
<p>2017: Collaborated with Pirelli to develop the CYCL-E tire for Stromer: the first premium, ultra-high performance tire for fast, urban electric bikes. Declined immediate assistance from paramedics after finally discovering the high limits of this tire’s traction on the wet handling track at their Vizzola Ticino proving grounds. Lesson learned: stay out of the marbles!</p>
<p>2018: Worked with Vee Tire Co. to create their E-Winter: the first M + S rated, ECE-R75 certified winter tire for L1e-B motor vehicles with a low-temperature-tolerant Silica compound and a load-specific pattern of siping across the tread blocks, which is also sold as the Stromer TW757.</p>
<p>2018: Sketched the first pencil drawings of what eventually became the RIDER T1: the first new, modern tire model designed with fit, form and function focused on vintage mountain bikes.</p>
<p>2019: Opened the molds needed to create the first prototypes of the RIDER T1. Evaluated the looks and function of the tire, and compared different constructions to determine the initial specification.</p>
<p>2020: Planned availability of the first production run of RIDER T1 tires. Barn finds, garage queens and museum pieces will now be able to retain their vintage looks, while benefitting from fresh, modern rubber.</p>

<h3>Risk Analysis</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Compared to many crowdfunding projects, we face fewer risks and challenges on the trail towards delivery of the RIDER T1, as the molds are complete, the prototypes tested, the initial specification confirmed, and the first production order has been placed with the factory.</p>
<p>The primary risks include:</p>
<p><strong>A SMALL TEAM</strong></p>
<p>As the first product offered under my new brand, I designed the RIDER T1 to help fellow vintage mountain bike enthusiasts ride more frequently, preserve our history and build the community.</p>
<p>However, until well after I have successfully delivered this first tire, TERRA ONE will only have a single employee: me. If an unforeseen illness or accident should sideline me during the production and shipping phases for the RIDER T1, its delivery date could be delayed.</p>
<p><strong>SUPPLY CHAIN</strong></p>
<p>Two custom tire designs which I developed with the same manufacturer chosen for the RIDER T1 are already in production, having been brought to market by another brand. I know and trust the key members of their team, having hosted them here in Switzerland and visited them in Thailand. During development, prototype, and production phases, they've consistently met or beat their delivery date estimates. Based on this experience, I am confident in their ability to produce my tires on schedule.</p>
<p>However, unexpected obstacles are always possible. As the future of my company rides strongly on the reputation of the RIDER T1, I will only begin shipping tires after they fully meet my high expectations for quality and performance. If a delay occurs, rest assured that I will be open about the reason with you, and realistic about its duration.</p>
<p><strong>DELIVERIES OUTSIDE SWITZERLAND &amp; THE EU</strong></p>
<p>I have made arrangements in the UK, the USA &amp; Australia (countries from which I expect high demand) to drop-ship the tires domestically. This is intended to reduce shipping costs &amp; protect my supporters in these countries from the possibility of having to pay import duty or other taxes on incoming shipments from Switzerland or the EU.</p>
<p>While I trust my partners, we simply aren't able to test these planned delivery channels in advance with the large volume of packages expected as perks from this campaign.  If significant shipping delays are expected in one of these countries, and I can ship tires to you directly without affecting deliveries to other supporters, I will contact you and give you that option.</p>
<p>If your country is not listed as an option within the Indiegogo shipping menu, please select Rest of the World, and I will personally ship the tires to you.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The RIDER T1 is designed to help us ride more vintage mountain bikes more often. While I'm thankful that other 26"" tires remain available, I'm confident that none of them suits most early mountain bikes as well as this one, combining period-appropriate looks, modern materials and unique design.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1580117598/oafbi3bttienhbe7j0np.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>No one tire can perfectly suit every rider, across every terrain, in every weather, on every bike. While the RIDER T1 provides balanced, all-around performance to fit many vintage mountain bikes, your support of this campaign will help Terra One produce additional tires which better suit other styles, conditions, eras &amp; models.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for supporting the goals of my Terra One brand, and ordering the RIDER T1 tire through this campaign. I look forward to hearing your stories about how they made new experiences possible with your classic mountain bikes: either online, or even better, while riding together. Enjoy!</p>

</div></div>","Overview
As a long-time enthusiast who collects mountain bikes from the period during which my love for cycling eventually became my career, I routinely uncover new finds from the 80s & 90s which are well worth restoring and riding, but whose tires are beyond saving.
Light-colored sidewalls which contrast black tread rubber are back in fashion, and we're lucky enough to have access to modern production of a couple classic MTB tire designs from the 90s, but I realized that no currently available tire incorporates the following design elements which ideally suit earlier mountain bikes.

Large, tall, simply-shaped tread elementsThe 80s called, and they're bringing big blocks back

A slightly directional, but not position-specific, tread patternUse the same tire both front & rear; a simple flip changes the grip

A round tire profileConsistent cornering control over all surfaces, from soft through hard

No graphics printed on the beige, 120TPI sidewallsHow much more beige could they be? The answer is none - none more beige

Folding, yet not tubeless-compatible, beadsThe only thing harder than mounting a tubeless tire to a vintage rim is removing it



Thanks to more than twenty years experience in bicycle product development, including developing custom tire designs for other brands with several tire manufacturers, I realized I was in a unique position to solve this problem.
I created my brand, Terra One, to help fellow vintage cycling enthusiasts preserve our history, build our community, and ride more frequently. The RIDER T1 tire is the first product which fully embraces those goals; a new tire for our original, off-road legends.
Your support of this crowdfunding campaign will ensure that the first production quantities of the RIDER T1 are efficiently delivered around the world, that a second production order can be  placed before the first one is shipped, and that molds to create the second Terra One tire design are opened as quickly as possible. Thank you!


Where the Project Stands

The RIDER T1 design was completed together with Vee Tire Co. in Thailand
Molds have been cut in their factory
Twenty prototypes, in five different versions, have been made, measured & ride-tested
Tooling revisions have been executed to more precisely manufacture the design
Initial production specifications have been confirmed, based on testing & feedback
Quality control standards have been agreed upon
A first order for 1,000 tires has been placed
A shipping date for this initial order has been provided


What Terra One Needs

Where should the first 1,000 tires be shipped?
It doesn't make sense to ship all the tires from Thailand to Switzerland first 
The order can be split into bulk shipments to the countries with the strongest demand
Early supporters will receive their tires sooner
Shipping costs will be lower
Reduced chances of import duties due upon receipt




Is support for the first Terra One tire strong enough to justify a second model right away?Once we reach the first stretch goal, I will fast-track the next Terra One tire
Reveal the model name and design to supporters
Spend funds raised to create the tooling needed to produce prototype tires
Plan a new campaign to launch the second Terra One tire model



How many tires should be ordered for the second production of the RIDER T1?Feedback to date indicates that my first order of 1,000 tires should quickly sell out
Measuring campaign demand will determine the right size for a second order
The funds raised will allow me to place the second order before the first one ships
If we reach the second stretch goal, I will add a second RIDER T1 specification




What Supporters Will Receive

The primary perk for this campaign is the RIDER T1: a new tire for our original, off-road legends. The initial production will be manufactured in a single specification as follows:
Size:                                     26 x 2.125
ETRTO:                               54-559
Measured Width:            56.5mm, at max pressure, on a 21mm rim (inner width)
Bead:                                  Folding
Tread Color:                      Black
Rubber:                              Dual compound (56 Shore A center with 48 Shore A sides)
Sidewall Color:                Beige
Casing:                               120 TPI
Target Weight:                 750g ± 30g
Inflation:                            22 - 50 PSI / 1.6 – 3.5 bar
Tire Type:                          Tubed
For those who pre-order the RIDER T1 through this campaign, I will include additional Terra One merchandise at no charge to properly thank you for your strong support. Since I don't want to dilute the value of my new tires by discounting their price before the first pair has been sold, the more tires you buy, the more Terra One swag you'll receive: for example, this hooded sweatshirt, printed by Bike Ninja UK. Thanks in advance for helping promote my new brand.

If you'd like to ensure a bright future for Terra One, but funds are too tight right now, I can also offer you this same merchandise at levels of support below the price of a pair of tires.
And if you commit to exceptional support of Terra One's goals, I'll invite you to visit me in Switzerland to spend a couple days living them with me: preserving history by tracking down hidden treasures to add to your collection, building community by meeting fellow vintage MTB enthusiasts and enjoying their collections, and naturally, riding as much as we can.
What Happens if the Campaign isn't Fully Funded?
Terra One is built to last. This crowdfunding campaign is intended to help me more fully achieve its goals, and more quickly serve the needs of passionate vintage cycling enthusiasts who want products beyond the RIDER T1, but its long-term future isn't entirely dependent on the short-term results of this campaign.
Terra One has committed funds to pay for the initial production run of 1,000 RIDER T1 tires. In the unlikely event that we don't reach the campaign's primary goal together, these tires will still be produced and sold, but likely shipped from Switzerland or Europe at higher total costs than through this campaign.
Stretch Goals
If we reach the first stretch goal of CHF 40,000 together, I will open molds for a second Terra One tire model, the design of which has been influenced by early feedback from supporters, both in person and on social media.
If we reach the second stretch goal of CHF 60,000 together, I will develop one additional specification of the RIDER T1, to be produced in a future order. Black sidewalls? Additional puncture protection? Colored tread rubber? You can help decide its future by supporting this campaign now.

About Pricing
Now that I'm managing my own brand, I'm determined to not make mistakes which I've seen too many times during my 20+ years on the supply side of the bicycle business. I intend for Terra One to act responsibly and consistently, so fair, stable pricing is important.

Core product value built on design, quality, performance & longevity
I aim to create timeless, classic products, which won't need to be updated often
No high suggested retail prices paired with deeply discounted everyday prices
All campaign discounts come in the form of no-charge promotional itemsThe base price of CHF/USD 100 per pair should remain stable over time



No online price wars between giant, global discounters
Consumer-direct sales during each product's initial launch phase
Later, a limited number of like-minded, long-term retail partners who share my goals
Museums which preserve our history and inspire new passion for old MTBs
Retailers which repair and restore vintage bikes, helping build our community
Organizations which hold events that bring us together to ride more frequently




A small, independent company, free of investor pressure and corporate politics
No outside influence pushing for constant growth & quarterly return on investment
No optimistic order quantities to achieve unrealistic forecasts, leading to overstock
A flexible, highly integrated manufacturing partner allows small orders & quick delivery
Reasonable profit margins, designed to support my company, my family & my partners

Check out the BD BladeWerX store to see which Axxis are available as well as more Bone Daddy gear!  Not a knife. Not an axe.Less than both but more than either. All serious adventurers know that an axe or a large camp knife, usually both, are critical for any deep journey into the bush. Anyone that has had to carry either knows what a pain in the A$$ it is to lug them around.Inspired by the simplicity of prehistoric man’s flint hand axes – the patent-pending Axxis hand axe is a perfect marriage between the versatility of a bushcraft knife and the awesome chopping power of an axe, with none of the dead weight of either.  10,000 YEARS IN THE MAKING In the bush, less is more. I’ve spent over a decade systematically stripping down my pack, reducing weight and improving functionality where I could. Easy enough for a tent or a sleeping bag, where innovations in materials and design have led to some major weight saving break-throughs. Unfortunately, when it comes to reducing the weight of bushcraft knives and camp axes, there has been little to no design evolution since the first stone blades and axes emerged on the scene tens of thousands of years ago. That is, until now...My design odyssey ultimately led to the discovery – or should I say, rediscovery – of the stone-age hand axe.    As ancient as fire itself, it is the great ancestor from whence the modern knife and axe emerged. Made from flint or stone, they could be chipped to produce razor-sharp edges for slicing and cutting, or lashed to wooden hafts to make axes. With this as a starting point, I began to see ways that modern technology could improve upon this stone age design. Creating a lighter, and more functionally versatile wood processing tool than has ever come before it.   Start having the sort of adventures you've always dreamt of,A knife when you need kindling or to prepare a meal. A hand axe when you need to clear a campsite or build a shelter. A full-size axe for felling giants and splitting logs. With 21st century materials and technology at our disposal, we made your primary bushcraft chopper, STRONGER, LIGHTER, BETTER so you can adventure FARTHER, DEEPER, FASTER.and carry the only tool versatile enough to fulfill your fantasies.      AXXIS TOOL SPECIFICATIONS    If you can spare a second, consider sharing the #AxxisKickstarter campaign online and tagging a friend or two who would value stripping a few pounds from their pack. Everyone is looking for a better adventure. You'd be helping the campaign and doing your friends a solid too! ???  11 UNIQUE FEATURES. ONE SOLID PIECE. NO MOVING PARTS.   In an orgiastic confluence of goodness, 11 unique design features come together in a harmonious union of form and function. Adventure with confidence; no matter how tough the path may get, the Axxis has what you need to get the job done.       Use a “pistol-whip” style swing to unleash the awesome chopping power of the Axxis. The forward-facing trigger rotates around your middle/pointer finger. The in-hand rotation or “axial rotation” aids the blade in gaining a far greater edge velocity than would be expected from a tool of this size.     Transforming the Axxis from a pocket-sized, EDC hand axe into a full-size axe is as simple as finding a tree in the woods. Literally.  When you need a haft, the entire forest becomes your hardware store. You bring the lashing cord and the Axxis will do the rest.     Boasting an astounding 10 different grip options – perhaps more – the Axxis can be used in more ways than we dare to count, and its skeletonized body with its many holes fit fingers of all sizes. CHOPPING, CUTTING, SPLITTING, SKINNING – find the grip that works best for you.   At only 14oz, the Axxis is far lighter than its closest competitors. With this pint-size tool, you can easily dispatch of any task that would normally require a much larger axe to complete.   This little beauty was cold forged from a solid hunk of 3/8” D2 Tool Steel. Often used to make dies for punching/cutting other metals, D2 is exceptionally wear-resistant and will aid the Axxis in maintaining an awesome edge over prolonged chopping use. Not to be too punny, but in short, what the Axxis lacks in length it more than compensates for with exceptional girth.     With no dedicated tie-down method, the Axxis was born for bondage. We strategically placed the lashing holes throughout the frame of the Axxis so you can tie it to a handle any way you like it.   Compact, with nearly 5 1/2 inches of hair-poppin' edge length from a tool that’s a mere 7 inches overall, we dare say it’s the littlest big axe that’s ever been made! And, its streamlined profile makes it discreet enough to fit in your pocket.   The Axxis was designed for ambidextrous use. Even the Kydex sheath can easily be reversed for left-hand users.    Made from D2 tool steel, which is something of a high carbon stainless, the Axxis is exceptionally wear-resistant and well guarded against rust and corrosion. Wipe her down with a little oil before you tuck her in at night and she’ll be ready to go in the morning.   Because the grip holes are integrated with the frame, your fingers are free to do more of what you need to do, when you need to do it, without ever having to put your Axxis down. As an extra security measure, the ambidextrous sheath guards the blade without interfering with your grip, or the lashings when mounted to a haft.   Unlike thick baked-on coatings that come off, Titanium Nitride(TiN) bonds with the metal on a molecular level for ultimate abrasion resistance. The TiN coating also provides a better protective barrier against corrosion and rust.    HAFTINGThe mounting wedge at the center of the tool aids in splitting the end of the haft so the Axxis can be inserted. Once seated, the channeled edges of the wedge secure the tool from sliding forward or back under heavy chopping.    The front and rear-facing triggers are a full 3/8"" thick and guard against ""head-pivot"" as well as prevent slippage by firmly bracing off the haft below the split. Lashing holes have been strategically placed throughout the frame so that even tie-pressure can be applied above, below, and throughout the tool, when being lashed. Once mounted and secured, this combination of features work synergistically to reinforce the axe head and promises a bushcrafting tool that is far greater than the sum of its parts.  

 
 HAND AXEUnlike traditional hand axes, the fully skeletonized frame of the Axxis allows you to engage the Axxis as though it were an extension of your own hand. However, the true beauty of the Axxis rests in its forward-facing trigger. This feature, in addition to the aggressively sloped pommel, work together to create an ergonomic grip which naturally encourages a ""pistol-whip"" style swing.    When it comes to hand axing, there are two grip options you can choose from depending on your comfort level. A 4 finger grip gives you more security, but less rotation, making it better suited for light work. The more advanced 3 finger grip option allows for a greater degree of ""axial rotation"" to occur in the user's hand around their pointer finger. Achieving a far greater edge velocity than would ordinarily be expected from a tool of this size.    What's in the box?  Within the box of each Axxis you’ll also find its reversible sheath, and a co-branded Madrock Ultra Light Wiregate Carabiner for carrying your Axxis any way you like. You'll also find a 10 ft length of paracord for lashing the Axxis to a haft during your next grand adventure into the bush. The First 200 & the Champions HaulThe Axxis hand axe is going to change the world. For the first time ever, there is truly an alternative to the knife or axe; more than either and less than both.

Nuff said…        Meet Bone Daddy Blade WerXStarting my own minimalist bushcraft company has always been a dream of mine. However, it only became a reality when I met the girl of my dreams. One year to the month after Jacqueline and I first met, Bone Daddy Blade Werx was born. Since then, we got married. And, like our commitment to each other, we are 100% committed to the successful launch of the Axxis and Bone Daddy Blade WerX at large.With 3 radical, new designs following hot on the heels of the Axxis, we produce skeletonized wilderness tools that reduce weight while increasing functionality SO YOU CAN DO MORE WITH LESS. Utilizing the same archaic principles that inspired the Axxis, our unorthodox approach to design has led to discoveries that will reshape the survival gear landscape and challenge adventurers the world over to rethink their entire approach to minimalist bush prep.  Thank you for supporting the dream and helping us to bring the Axxis Hand Axe to the world!

The perfect balance of power and agility. Behemoth lets you glide <strong>across any terrain</strong> with ease while giving you <strong>a tight turning radius and balanced ride</strong> so you can drift and slide around corners. It features an <strong>independent suspension system</strong> only found on fast, high-end cars. This advanced <strong>self-leveling suspension</strong> gives the Behemoth the balancing power and shock absorption of a car and gives you a perfectly balanced and controlled ride.</p><div>

<h3><strong>Off-Road Shock Absorption</strong></h3>
<p>Behemoth uses the same shock absorption structure as high-end cars. The bridge frame of each wheel adjusts to the right itself, absorbing bumps so you never feel them, and ensuring you stay upright and balanced. This ensures a smooth ride on any road or surface you decide to hit up.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s4.gifyu.com/images/256e5cc0f9963130a.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Tightest Turning Radius</strong></h3>
<p>Using a unique bridge frame design, the Behemoth gives each wheel more space for movement. And <strong>at 120cm</strong>, it offers the <strong>best and tightest turning radius in the world</strong>. All without compromising on flexibility, performance, or balance. Meaning you can drift and turn around right corners no matter what terrain you’re in. <strong>No other e-board can turn on a dime as tightly or quickly as the Behemoth.</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1614849240/elbmarzmwwvzs5wzrdtb.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>

<p>Enjoy a smooth ride wherever you ride. Using <strong>155mm extra-large grain off-road rubber tires</strong> inspired by off-road vehicle tires. This, combined with our independent suspension system, lets Behemoth deliver incredible stability on any road, surface, or terrain.</p>

<p>With <strong>each swing arm working independently to balance itself</strong>, this lets each wheel keep Behemoth’s deck flat. This means you have the ability to adjust to meet the demands of every environment you want to ride through without worrying about terrain slowing down your adventures or losing balance on a bumpy trail.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1614850135/hjd9sweiqajvrhzslwo0.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>The difference between not having a <strong>self-leveling suspension system</strong> and having one on your electric board is like day and night.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1614850262/sknbarlxvbvx1fielb8z.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The independent suspension on the truck of each wheel allows for <strong>automatic swing amplitude adjustment based on terrain conditions</strong>. Whether you’re driving on bumpy city roads or uneven gravel paths, the swingarm on each wheel will <strong>angle and auto-adjust to keep the board perfectly balanced</strong>.</p>
<p>It further absorbs the vibrational force exerted by riding on uneven ground, allowing the deck to always <strong>stay horizontally stable</strong>.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1614850323/g1yxgejdag3jsnfxphjh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Our suspension system is directly inspired by the shock absorption principle and independent suspension of high-end cars such as BMWs.</p>
<p>The shock absorption that Behemoth’s self-leveling suspension offers is so smooth and far beyond what regular boards offer that you’ll probably never want to ride on a rigid axle board ever again.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>With an<strong> entire deck made of carbon fiber</strong>, you won’t have to worry about any weather or environmental hazards. The Behemoth is strong enough to handle any adventure while staying light and thin. Thanks to <strong>the slim edge design</strong> and how carbon fiber is sharped; it offers more space for wrapped batteries while maintaining a thin body. Meaning you won’t have to worry about wear and tear from the bottom.</p>

</div></div>","Meet TeamGee’s Behemoth. The perfect balance of power and agility. Behemoth lets you glide across any terrain with ease while giving you a tight turning radius and balanced ride so you can drift and slide around corners. It features an independent suspension system only found on fast, high-end cars. This advanced self-leveling suspension gives the Behemoth the balancing power and shock absorption of a car and gives you a perfectly balanced and controlled ride.

Behemoth is made for your all-terrain, off-road, and cross-country adventures. Whether you’re riding through mountain roads, desert trails, gravel paths, or are just out for bigger and better experiences, Behemoth will help you make the most of any ride. Go on any trail knowing your board will let you ride across it with ease.

Off-Road Shock Absorption
Behemoth uses the same shock absorption structure as high-end cars. The bridge frame of each wheel adjusts to the right itself, absorbing bumps so you never feel them, and ensuring you stay upright and balanced. This ensures a smooth ride on any road or surface you decide to hit up.

 
The Tightest Turning Radius
Using a unique bridge frame design, the Behemoth gives each wheel more space for movement. And at 120cm, it offers the best and tightest turning radius in the world. All without compromising on flexibility, performance, or balance. Meaning you can drift and turn around right corners no matter what terrain you’re in. No other e-board can turn on a dime as tightly or quickly as the Behemoth.

 

Enjoy a smooth ride wherever you ride. Using 155mm extra-large grain off-road rubber tires inspired by off-road vehicle tires. This, combined with our independent suspension system, lets Behemoth deliver incredible stability on any road, surface, or terrain.
We opted for rubber tires and aluminum wheels to provide better elasticity, wear-resistance, and puncture defense than traditional tires.
 

With each swing arm working independently to balance itself, this lets each wheel keep Behemoth’s deck flat. This means you have the ability to adjust to meet the demands of every environment you want to ride through without worrying about terrain slowing down your adventures or losing balance on a bumpy trail.

 

The difference between not having a self-leveling suspension system and having one on your electric board is like day and night.

The independent suspension on the truck of each wheel allows for automatic swing amplitude adjustment based on terrain conditions. Whether you’re driving on bumpy city roads or uneven gravel paths, the swingarm on each wheel will angle and auto-adjust to keep the board perfectly balanced.
It further absorbs the vibrational force exerted by riding on uneven ground, allowing the deck to always stay horizontally stable.

Our suspension system is directly inspired by the shock absorption principle and independent suspension of high-end cars such as BMWs.
The shock absorption that Behemoth’s self-leveling suspension offers is so smooth and far beyond what regular boards offer that you’ll probably never want to ride on a rigid axle board ever again.
 


With an entire deck made of carbon fiber, you won’t have to worry about any weather or environmental hazards. The Behemoth is strong enough to handle any adventure while staying light and thin. Thanks to the slim edge design and how carbon fiber is sharped; it offers more space for wrapped batteries while maintaining a thin body. Meaning you won’t have to worry about wear and tear from the bottom.

 
Waterproof Deck and Motors
Thanks to its enclosed carbon fiber body protecting the batteries, the Behemoth is IP54 waterproof rated, so you can take it through puddles and the rain without fear of damage.
 

Enjoy 22 Miles (36 KM) of range at a top speed of 25 MPH (40KM/H). And Behemoth comes with four-speed modes so you can find your ideal acceleration & braking and control your ride with ease.
  
Speed Modes

Low: 6-7MPH
Medium: 12-15MPH
High: 24-25MPH (5-8s over full speed)
High Plus: 0-25MPH (3-5s over full speed) 

 

Behemoth uses regenerative braking technology to regain battery power while slowing down. Meaning you’re recharging your battery and making it last longer every time you go downhill or break.
 

Behemoth uses state-of-the-art dual hub motors that hide inside its wheels. The 600W brushless motors work to increase energy efficiency and reduce energy loss, allowing you to ride up 30° steep hills with ease.
 


Behemoth comes with 2 powerful LED lights so you can enjoy your night rides safely. The front spotlight lets you see obstacles coming your way on the road while also giving you a cool under-light for your rides. And the LED tail-light with 3 auto-switching colors (Green/Yellow/Red). ensures you’ll be seen by anyone coming behind you.

 

The power behind the Behemoth is its built-in 12AH lithium batteries. Taking only 3 hours to charge from 0 to 100%, the 18650 battery is inspired by and uses the design of electric car batteries to give you a far-riding range, high energy storage, and thousands of re-charges.

 


Shaped For Stability
With a unique U-shaped foot contour, Behemoth offers the firmest and most stable foot placement of any board. And the concave design gives even more rider stability by helping to remove any shock resistance and keeping the board balanced on any uneven surface.
 

World-Class 3M Grip Tape
Behemoth uses 3M shock-absorbing rubber grip tape to provide you with awesome wear resistance and a better grip than sandpaper. This means your grip tape will last longer while letting you stay firmly planted on your board.
 

Experience unparalleled control in the palm of your hand. Enjoy 4-speed modes, 4 braking modes, and all the information, from battery level to speed, to keep you riding for as long as possible.

 

4 Speed Modes：H+, H, M, L
H+ for professionals, L for beginners
Four gear brake force：B4, B3, B2, B1
B4 is the strongest, B1 is the weakest

Inspired by the largest creature in mythology, Behemoth has unmatched power, speed, and design. We wanted every ride to feel like they were riding a beast of old, whose biblical might and strength are yours to wield on your adventures.

TeamGee has been a leader in electric longboard design for years. We are focused on helping people transition to new ways of riding and commuting. Our boards have won multiple awards, been written about and highly reviewed, and have been ridden on every continent across the world. And we have no plans of slowing down.

Professionally designed for athletes, Inxtinct insoles will give you maximum movement control, faster reacting times, and reduce the chance of injuries. Even in daily life, it will provide superior support and comfort after prolonged standing or walking. In professional sports games, the slightest difference may determine if you win or lose. Inxtinct insoles, with their innovative S-shaped guidance design and TPR anti-slip particles, will be the essential gear to help boost your athletic performance.  Inxtinct insoles take pride in their patented S-shaped design. Based on rigid studies of ergonomics of the foot and the configuration of stress distribution, Inxtinct insoles can effectively guide the transmission of the kinetic energy of the foot to establish a complete gait habit. The force flow of a natural and healthy gait should be S-shaped. The action force from your feet to the ground flows, starting from the outer sole of the heel, and gradually moving to the inner side of the sole, and finally ending with a toe-off.   The shape of an insole greatly influences the maximum stress and its distribution, and Inxtinct insoles can reduce pressure felt on key peak pressure points and guide you to naturally perform an S-shaped gait.    The height difference of Inxtinct insoles can help you exert your full athletic strength, minimize fatigue when going through intensive training, and reduce the valgus angle of the sole when moving laterally.  Improper foot protection during lateral movements will cause the foot arch to collapse, further causing the foot to slip down or lead to painful pes valgus. Inxtinct insoles will provide a supportive energizing foundation and protect your feet from injuries.  Unlike other insoles that add auxiliary materials to support your foot arch, Inxtinct uses the subtractive design to create a natural arch height difference, guiding you to perform naturally the S-shaped gait.  When you are performing intense exercise, you might notice that your feet slide and move constantly within your shoes. These movements, no matter how slight, limit your performance and speed potential. Inxtinct insoles, with their TPR anti-slip granules, give you excellent foot control and reactivity.  After putting on the Inxtinct insoles, your toes will not move back and forth in the shoes, sparing you from having blisters. And the friction tests show that Inxtinct insoles grip better than other insoles in both dry and wet conditions!  The special TPR anti-slip granules give the insole 6 times the grip compared to other insoles, locking in the vertical and horizontal displacement of the insole. Our TPR particles are placed in the S-shaped zone for more traction.  Inxtinct insoles support your foot arch and lower the position of your thumb ball, keeping your sole in the optimal position and your fascia in the most comfortable state.   The original version of our insoles was composed of EVA (Ethylene-Vinyl Acetate) material, but after several refinements, we came up with the 2021 Indiegogo brand new edition by blending 20% of rubber elastomers with EVA. This upgraded high-elasticity EVA composite material allows the reinvented Inxtinct Insoles to possess greater flexibility and durability, enhance natural shock absorption, and reduce the chance of insole deformation.   If you are suffering from recurrent and chronic problems, including bunion, plantar fasciitis, deformed thumb, and even lower back pain, look at your shoe soles, it’s very likely that your footwears are at fault.  Simply by standing, we are placing pressure on our feet and joints, so not only athletes but also people from all walks of life deserve a pair of comfortable insoles. The Inxtinct team came up with the Daily Life Edition for people that have to be on their feet all day, runners, and joggers to provide extra comfort for everyone!   Performing a natural gait is even more essential for children, for an unhealthy posture can lead to severe foot problems in the long term. The Children Edition will help position children’s thumb into the proper place, and guide them to perform a healthy gait with the S-shaped design.  We highly suggest you measure the length of your current insole instead of simply checking your shoe size. The difference between consecutive sizes of Inxtinct insoles is only 0.4 to 0.5cm, making your shoes fit as if they were custom-made.  Normally, people choose the insole size that corresponds with their shoe size, without even noticing that two same-sized shoes may have inner insoles of different sizes and shapes due to the functions. Without the right size, insoles can’t offer maximum performance enhancement. Every professional athlete has their own customized shoes, for the structure of the insoles and the shoes fit their feet perfectly. If your insole keeps sliding in your shoe, it will certainly lead to extreme discomfort and reduce your athletic performance. We conducted a small experiment to demonstrate the importance of choosing the correct size of your insoles.  Inxtinct insoles are for all athletes who want to improve their performance and anyone that yearns for extra comfort to tackle their day. We have offered some samples of our insoles to various users for a tryout before we publish the project. Let’s see what they said about our design!                Inxtinct insoles inherit the 90-year craftsmanship from the fourth-generation of a Taiwanese shoe-making family, which has long cooperated with well-known sports brands such as Nike and Adidas. Our designer was an enthusiastic soccer player, and after accidentally twisted the anterior cruciate ligament of his left knee, he started to acquire knowledge of the human body structure during his rehabilitation and began to brainstorm and design Inxtinct insoles for others to prevent injuries. The design has undergone multiple testing experiments conducted by the Sports Biomechanics Laboratory of PCCU.  Later, we went beyond designing insoles for sport-lovers. We looked for answers to improve the problems of backache, plantar fasciitis, and standing discomfort for people from all walks of life, and months later, the Daily Life Edition and Children Edition were designed. After multiple refinements, we started to design various sizes for everyone.  To ensure the quality of our insoles, we cooperated with Taiwan Paiho, the leading Taiwanese listed company for the manufacture and distribution of the related products for shoes and garments. The renowned company has gained recognition in the global sporting goods market, providing materials for international brands, including Nike, Adidas, Reebok, and Puma. With their exclusive technology, we are able to adhere the TPR anti-slip granules to the fabric, and you can rest assured that our design can withstand all the everyday tear and wear, giving you the extra power, control, and comfort you deserve!  Paiho and Inxtinct are the co-owners of INXTINCT INSOLE, from the basic product designs to technology development, Paiho and Inxtinct have both been the cornerstone of their shared success. Furthermore, Paiho will also take responsibility for manufacturing and the delivery of INXTINCT INSOLE. Paiho & Inxtinct Official Declaration of CooperationPaiho and Inxtinct both own specific patents of INXTINCT INSOLE, with Inxtinct owning patents for insole designs and structure refinements, and Paiho owning their trademarked TPR Anti-Slip technology.

En fabricant uniquement ce qui a été commandé, il n'y a pas de stocks perdus, pas de gaspillage.

Découvrez notre collection:- Le maillot à manches courtes a été conçu pour les sorties au-dessus de 15°C. Tout en étant extrêmement respirant et léger, il offre également un ajustement parfait.

<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p>This journey began when COVID forced bunker rakes off the courses. That sparked Ryan Curran, a professional golfer on the Ontario/Canadian mini-tour circuit, to scratch out the initial design of <strong>Rake Caddy</strong> on a napkin. Isn’t that how all great ideas are born? Ryan brought the idea to me, Mike White, a Mental Performance Coach and former Marketing Agency owner, and a partnership was formed.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>The BIG Question</h3>
<p>But the question we asked ourselves was, “Does this idea have life after COVID?”.  Judging by the reaction to our prototype, the answer was a resounding, “Yes!”. The convenience factor alone scored extremely high with our small test group.  <strong>Rake Caddy</strong> is always with you.</p>

<li>Avoids the question, “What is that green thing on the handle?”.</li>
<li>No splinters or bugs, snakes and other surprises hiding in the grass.</li>

It's about time we give more thought to our best adventure buddies and provide them the best experiences in the wild.Let's change how we backpack with our dogs, starting here!
Separate section in the tent for your dog
Dog area accessible through large indoor mesh wall 
Separate outside doggy door 
Lightweight at 5lb 2oz
Waterproof and seam sealed
Quick and easy set-up
Side wall pocket
Hanging gear loft 
FREE tent footprint 
 If your dog is crate trained or loves their personal space at night, they will thrive with this tent set-up. After using our Kings Peak tent for the first time I can tell you, we won’t be using any other tent. Ollie slept more than he ever has backpacking, which is important because dogs need their rest just as much as humans do. He was never anxious because he could see that we were right next to him all night, and I even slept better knowing he was safe in his own area.  Trail weight: 5lbs 2oz Main Tent Floor & Rainfly: 30-denier polyurethane-coated ripstop nylonMesh: 15-denier ripstop nylon meshPoles: 8.5MM AluminumTent width: 52in Human section length: 88inDog section length: 24inTent height: 46in When we initially came up with this tent idea we were stoked about it. Then the prototype finally came and we were honestly anxious about trying it out because it didn’t matter how much we liked the idea, what mattered was if the dogs liked it! Let me tell you, Ollie thrived with this set up. Both Ollie and I slept better backpacking than we ever have! If you’re not convinced yet, we think your dog will be.
Let’s be honest both you, and more importantly, your dog will get a better night’s rest in your own separate spaces
It separates your dirty pup from your gear 
You can leave the doggy door open for them to roam while keeping your section partitioned off from mosquitoes and other bugs  
You will know your dog is safe and protected from the elements inside the tent
The interior wall is mesh reducing anxiety for your dog, and you, because they can see you at all times
The separate dog section utilizes your dog’s natural instinct or prior crate training to adjust quickly for a good night’s rest 
“For thousands of years dogs have sought out small, enclosed spaces for shelter and security. Crating your dog can give him that feeling of safety, like he has his own room to go to.” -American Kennel Club (AKC) This tent has 30% more space than your average 2 person tent to accommodate 2 people and 1-2 dogs. Besides the fact of keeping dirt and mud off your gear, the separate dog section utilizes your dog’s natural instinct or prior crate training to adjust quickly for a good night’s rest. Ollie is a restless sleeper at night unless he is in his crate. We will never use another tent with Ollie after experiencing the difference in sleep both he and we got.The large mesh wall on the inside is removable to allow quick access to your dog. The see-through material is there to let you and your dog see each other at all times and to enclose their space if desired to create a crate-like appearance. This wall can be easily unzipped so you can hang out with your dog while still leaving a thin baseboard to keep water and dirt away from your gear.A separate exit for your dog can provide many benefits.

It works seamlessly in crowds, doesn't require any extra peripherals and you can buy it at a starting price of 1099$. Travelmate integrates with your smartphone to accomplish complex tasks that no other suitcase can do. It can move vertically or horizontally with ease. You can put more items or perhaps another suitcase on top of Travelmate when it is traveling autonomously in horizontal mode. Travelmate navigates large crowds and is able to recognize and avoid objects as needed. As you can see in the video above, our suitcase is not just a concept – it is a real working model and all of the features demonstrated already work on the Travelmate autonomous robotic suitcase.</p><div data-id=""13739224""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/013/739/224/5334d75133cd13d63631c328643e2ca2_original.gif?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1473890786&amp;q=92&amp;s=1fcc5c4a4feee93dd27f3f9bb226ee73"" src=""""/></div><div data-id=""13739224""> </div><div>
<p>Travelmate is available to purchase right now on indiegogo. We launched our indiegogo project to raise funds for commercial scale production, to expand our team and to establish distribution channels for Travelmate. Now, we have accomplished all of that and have officially released Travelmate! There are currently 3 different suitcase models, ranging from carry on sized to a large suitcase. Travelmate is practical, innovative and brings the future to you. If you decide to back Travelmate, then thank you very much for your support!</p>

<p>Travelmate isn't just a normal suitcase -- it's an autonomous robot companion that follows you wherever you go and makes traveling much easier. Our suitcase is smart enough to always follow you and avoid any obstacles in its way. Travelmate is perfect for any situation. It can carry your stuff for you when you're going to work, walking to school or rushing to the airport gate. Smart features like omni wheels and our Follow Me system means that Travelmate is at the cutting edge of AI and autonomous movement technology. The Follow Me system has built in sensors that detect as well as avoid obstacles like people and furniture. It uses the Travelmate application to follow you and to better pinpoint its location at all times.</p>

<p>In addition to fully autonomous horizontal and vertical modes, the Travelmate has a variety of useful features that other suitcases do not have. The battery that powers Travelmate can be easily removed and is charged with wireless technology. The battery can be used to charge almost all electronics through a USB port and a standard electrical outlet. In addition, the Travelmate suitcase features unique optional omni wheels that allow for unprecedented multi-directional movement. This is great for autonomous technology. Since the suitcase functions as a robot in practice, it uses AI and machine learning to optimize its movements and omni wheels allow for markedly increased stability and range of motion.</p>

It works seamlessly in crowds, doesn't require any extra peripherals and you can buy it at a starting price of 1099$. Travelmate integrates with your smartphone to accomplish complex tasks that no other suitcase can do. It can move vertically or horizontally with ease. You can put more items or perhaps another suitcase on top of Travelmate when it is traveling autonomously in horizontal mode. Travelmate navigates large crowds and is able to recognize and avoid objects as needed. As you can see in the video above, our suitcase is not just a concept – it is a real working model and all of the features demonstrated already work on the Travelmate autonomous robotic suitcase. 
Travelmate is available to purchase right now on indiegogo. We launched our indiegogo project to raise funds for commercial scale production, to expand our team and to establish distribution channels for Travelmate. Now, we have accomplished all of that and have officially released Travelmate! There are currently 3 different suitcase models, ranging from carry on sized to a large suitcase. Travelmate is practical, innovative and brings the future to you. If you decide to back Travelmate, then thank you very much for your support!

 
Travelmate isn't just a normal suitcase -- it's an autonomous robot companion that follows you wherever you go and makes traveling much easier. Our suitcase is smart enough to always follow you and avoid any obstacles in its way. Travelmate is perfect for any situation. It can carry your stuff for you when you're going to work, walking to school or rushing to the airport gate. Smart features like omni wheels and our Follow Me system means that Travelmate is at the cutting edge of AI and autonomous movement technology. The Follow Me system has built in sensors that detect as well as avoid obstacles like people and furniture. It uses the Travelmate application to follow you and to better pinpoint its location at all times.

 

 

In addition to fully autonomous horizontal and vertical modes, the Travelmate has a variety of useful features that other suitcases do not have. The battery that powers Travelmate can be easily removed and is charged with wireless technology. The battery can be used to charge almost all electronics through a USB port and a standard electrical outlet. In addition, the Travelmate suitcase features unique optional omni wheels that allow for unprecedented multi-directional movement. This is great for autonomous technology. Since the suitcase functions as a robot in practice, it uses AI and machine learning to optimize its movements and omni wheels allow for markedly increased stability and range of motion.

 
The Travelmate's autonomous functionality is unmatched and doesn't require any extra peripherals. All you need is the suitcase and your smartphone. Travelmate will follow you wherever you go. Whether you're at the airport, going to work or going to school; the Travelmate suitcase can help you carry luggage in a wide variety of situations.
 Travelmate has a battery life of 4 hours when in full autonomous mode and up to 100 hours in stand by mode (meaning when you are using it like a normal suitcase). The electric motor and internal components that enable autonomous functionality take up almost no space in the suitcase, accounting for less than 3% of the suitcase's volume. Multi colored LED lighting is a feature on all Travelmate models and signifies your suitcase's battery level. There are over 16 million different color variations. You can customize or turn off all LED lighting through the Travelmate application. The Travelmate suitcase features convenient directional indicators that show you exactly where it's going at all times. This is similar to turn signals in cars. We've also added a speaker that will inform you of obstacles and the suitcase's location – this feature is completely optional and you can turn it on or off in the Travelmate application. In addition to autonomy, we've differentiated ourselves with convenient features like a customizable design, a smart lock system, a built in scale, an integrated camera and much more. Travelmate is fully TSA compliant and our suitcase sizes are standardized. The smallest Travelmate is carry on sized and fits the specifications of all major airlines' requirements for carry on specifications. The Travelmate has a smart lock system. You can open your suitcase directly or through your smartphone. In order to comply with TSA guidelines, we have also included a mechanism to manually open the suitcase. You can always add a separate lock to your suitcase for extra security.
(Omni wheels)Travelmate includes a GPS chip that helps orient the suitcase and allows you to know the location of the suitcase at all times with the Travlemate smartphone application. All Travelmate models will include a built in scale that will accurately measure the weight of your suitcase's contents. You'll never have to worry about over packing because Travelmate will conveniently display the suitcase's weight. You can switch between Kilograms or Pounds via the Travelmate application. The Travelmate autonomous suitcase is fully functional and we have full app integration ready. Travelmate will constantly improve through machine learning. This is achieved by uploading movement data automatically to the Travelmate application; your suitcase will essentially become smarter and smarter as time goes on and more people have Travelmate suitcases. You can disable this feature in the app if you want to. After it releases, we have plans to update the free Travelmate application regularly to improve and add features. Eventually we want to add things like travel suggestions, airport information, airport gate information and much more to the application.The vast majority of our team consists of robotics specialists and that's very evident when you look at the Travelmate's features. It's far more than just a suitcase. Travelmate has integrated adaptive AI that knows where it's going at all times and adjusts its movement on the fly. Some examples of other practical applications for the Travelmate are using it as a guide for people who are visually impaired or as a robot friend who can respond to simple commands (you can turn this feature on or off). You can also mount a camera to the Travelmate which can be incredibly useful when you don't have anyone else to film you.  Our goal for Travelmate is for it to eventually become the first widely available and affordable robot companion.  The Travelmate application is crucial for this. We've worked hard to make it easy to use and feature rich. We think that the best way to make sure that your Travelmate always improves is to give you the freedom to do whatever you want with it. You can add more features to your Travelmate by looking through new features that developers have made for the Travelmate application.   Travelmate is constantly evolving and has actual elements of artificial intelligence. This is a first for smart suitcases. Travelmate is truly autonomous and improves by looking at data from all other Travelmate suitcases to improve its movement, actions and response time. This principal has been applied before to other technology, but we are the first to do it for suitcases.  One example of a possible future feature is to use as an impromptu security guard. If you attach a camera to it, you can leave it to patrol your home even when you're not there. There is endless potential to implement more features like this and that's why we call Travelmate a robot companion. You can attach cameras or virtual reality ready cameras to the suitcase; because of this, you can use the Travelmate as your camera operator. This is perfect for video blogging or for recording yourself and your surroundings.  You can attach a 360 degree VR camera to your Travelmate. • Make VR ready video blogs.

</div></div>","Wireless. Waterproof. Wearable. The Glowstone Flashlight is a tiny, ultra-bright and ultra-tough light. It’s as bright as expensive high powered flashlights, yet just 1/2"" (13mm) thick and a fraction of the price.Glowstone has reinvented the everyday flashlight to be more compact, versatile and functional so it can be easily used for everything from DIY jobs, outdoor adventuring and even scuba diving!   Its shape and design make it incredibly versatile and rugged. You can clip it to your belt, stick it to a wall, mount it to your GoPro or attach it to the Glowstone tripod handle. Whatever you’re doing, the Glowstone Flashlight will never leave you in the dark again. And we really mean rugged. This little guy can handle pretty much everything you throw at it. Its tough silicone case and ATEX rated design make it waterproof, heatproof, shockproof and gasproof.This is the only torch you'll ever need. The Glowstone Flashlight is wireless charging only, the benefit of which allows us to completely seal the Flashlight in the super tough, yet soft silicone casing.  Underneath that soft silicone case, the electronics are mounted onto a thick aluminum substrate that gives the Flashlight a solid rigidity. This unique construction means there no mechanical join lines, weak points or leak paths in the smooth, soft and incredibly durable design. This also helps preserves the electronics and batteries from oxidisation, extending its life even further. Glowstone Flashlight is IP69K waterproof and EX hazardous area rated. We choose silicone for a number of reasons, and it's part of the reason why this is a total reinvention of the flashlight. Silicone is both soft, highly durable and incredibly resistant to degradation from the elements, making it the ideal choice for sustained outdoor use. It's also made from silica that comes from sand, so it's more ocean-friendly than the plastic that's littering the world's oceans.The Glowstone Flashlight is available in white or dark grey. The difference between the Glowstone Flashlight compared to a standard flashlight is staggering. To put it to the test, watch our video of a normal flashlight vs Glowstone Flashlight. See what happens... Simplicity is the key to a great product and the Glowstone Flashlight is a testament to this. We wanted to make the user experience as easy as using a light switch in your home, so with a single button you can switch between the 8 modes.  
Press the middle power button once to turn on the flashlight to 90 lumens mode.
Switch between various modes:

Press once for 90 lumens normal mode

<p>OUR MATERIALS</p>
<p>SILICONE</p>
<p>When designing the HUNU cup we had a few non negotiable requirements. It had to be compact enough to comfortably carry around in a pocket all day. It had to be sturdy enough to safely hold a hot drink. It had to be made using the highest quality food grade materials. It had to look good and be light and durable. None of this changed when we started the design work for HUNU+</p>
<p>Silicone is a highly durable, non toxic material that can withstand extreme temperatures and doesn't leech toxic chemicals. It is very easy to clean and flexible enough to fold down easily but strong enough to form a sturdy, safe cup when unfolded.</p>
<p>The silicone we use is both LFGB and FDA certified meaning it meets the highest level of both USA and European certification.</p>
<p>PLASTIC</p>
<p>When we brought out our original HUNU cup we used a bamboo composite for the lid (a mixture of resin and bamboo fibre). However our goal is to always be learning and over the course of last year we learned more and more about recyclable plastic and what a stable and safe material it is as well as how widely it can be recycled. We have since chosen to use a BPA and BPS free polypropylene for our new lids. While there are many new materials coming onto the market and we will always looking for ways we could improve, right now not many of the plant based plastics are durable enough or easily recycled enough to compete with polypropylene.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>CLEANING YOUR CUP</p>
<p>Silicone is very non porous meaning that it is incredibly easy to clean. If you are out and about during the day a simple rinse out with water or even a wipe with a napkin will often be enough. At the end of the day using some dish soap in the sink or taking the lid and band off and popping everything in the dishwasher works great.</p>
<p>The HUNU cup is fully dishwasher safe!</p>
<p>OUR DESIGN PROCESS</p>
<p>When designing our first HUNU cup we started out with one very clear thought. Single use cups are convenient. Reusable cups are not. How do we change that? By designing a cup that fits in your pocket as easily as your phone or keys ensuring that its always with you when you need it.</p>
<p>So we started with some basic principles.</p>
<p>It needed to be big enough to hold your coffee but collapse small enough to fit in your pocket.</p>
<p>It needed to be sturdy and have a lid.</p>
<p>It needed to have some form of insulating so that you could hold even the hottest drinks.</p>
<p>With HUNU+ we still had these principles at the forefront but to them we added all the feedback we have received from all our amazing backers to not only increase the size but to improve on every aspect that we could.</p>
<p>Playing around with these early prototypes led to the refining of our design. More 3D rendering allowed us to see how different colours and materials could look.</p>
<p>After a first round of prototyping we continually refined our design to make sure all the details were up to the standard we needed. From fit of the lid (loose enough to take on and off but tight enough to be leakproof) to feel of the silicone (stiff enough to be a great cup but flexible enough to fold easily) to size of the drinking hole and plug we have worked on every detail.</p>

</div><p> </p></div>","Hi! We are HUNU. Two years ago we set about to create a cup that we could carry with us all day, everyday. And now we've made it bigger and better! To preorder HUNU+ and help us bring it to life click BACK THIS PROJECT or keep scrolling to find out more :)
We are able to offer shipping to most of the world and are aiming to ship locally from within the USA, UK, Europe and Canada.



HUNU+ features a unique new folding system that allows a 16oz cup to easily fold into a 3 cm disk without compromising on the sturdiness of the cup. 
 
Every time you use your own cup one less piece of plastic goes to landfill. HUNU+ is a reusable cup that you will not only love using but also one that will actually be with you when you need it!



Our goal at HUNU is to design reusable products that fit into your life and HUNU+ does just that by slipping away easily into a pocket or bag after use.


 

We founded HUNU because we realized that we could do better. We started looking around and learning about how much the little bit of daily waste we use add up.

It works seamlessly in crowds, doesn't require any extra peripherals and you can buy it at a starting price of 399$. Travelmate integrates with your smartphone to accomplish complex tasks that no other suitcase can do. It can move vertically or horizontally with ease. You can put more items or perhaps another suitcase on top of Travelmate when it is traveling autonomously in horizontal mode. Travelmate navigates large crowds and is able to recognize and avoid objects as needed. As you can see in the video above, our suitcase is not just a concept – it is a real working model and all of the features demonstrated already work on the Travelmate autonomous robotic suitcase.</p><div data-id=""13739224""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/013/739/224/5334d75133cd13d63631c328643e2ca2_original.gif?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1473890786&amp;q=92&amp;s=1fcc5c4a4feee93dd27f3f9bb226ee73"" src="""" style=""""/></div><div data-id=""13739224""> </div><div>
<p>Travelmate is a fully working prototype. We are launching an indiegogo project to raise funds for commercial scale production, to expand our team and to establish distribution channels for Travelmate.  There are currently 3 different suitcase models, ranging from carry on sized to a large suitcase. Our goal is to make Travelmate practical, innovative and to bring the future to you. The prices that we are offering on indiegogo are lower than what we will price for retail, and that is because you are actually supporting the development of this project. If you decide to back Travelmate, then thank you very much for your support!</p>

<p>Travelmate isn't just a normal suitcase -- it's an autonomous robot companion that follows you wherever you go and makes traveling much easier. Our suitcase is smart enough to always follow you and avoid any obstacles in its way. Travelmate is perfect for any situation. It can carry your stuff for you when you're going to work, walking to school or rushing to the airport gate. Smart features like omni wheels and our Follow Me system means that Travelmate is at the cutting edge of AI and autonomous movement technology. The Follow Me system has built in sensors that detect as well as avoid obstacles like people and furniture. It uses the Travelmate application to follow you and to better pinpoint its location at all times.</p>

<p>In addition to fully autonomous horizontal and vertical modes, the Travelmate has a variety of useful features that other suitcases do not have. The battery that powers Travelmate can be easily removed and is charged with wireless technology. The battery can be used to charge almost all electronics through a USB port and a standard electrical outlet. In addition, the Travelmate suitcase features unique omni wheels that allow for unprecedented multi-directional movement. This is crucial for autonomous technology. Since the suitcase functions as a robot in practice, it uses AI and machine learning to optimize its movements and omni wheels allow for markedly increased stability and range of motion that cannot be achieved otherwise.</p>

You can pre-order Travelmate by clicking here: https://igg.me/at/travelmate/x/15028332 News about us:Travelmate is the first true fully autonomous suitcase. It works seamlessly in crowds, doesn't require any extra peripherals and you can buy it at a starting price of 399$. Travelmate integrates with your smartphone to accomplish complex tasks that no other suitcase can do. It can move vertically or horizontally with ease. You can put more items or perhaps another suitcase on top of Travelmate when it is traveling autonomously in horizontal mode. Travelmate navigates large crowds and is able to recognize and avoid objects as needed. As you can see in the video above, our suitcase is not just a concept – it is a real working model and all of the features demonstrated already work on the Travelmate autonomous robotic suitcase. 
Travelmate is a fully working prototype. We are launching an indiegogo project to raise funds for commercial scale production, to expand our team and to establish distribution channels for Travelmate.  There are currently 3 different suitcase models, ranging from carry on sized to a large suitcase. Our goal is to make Travelmate practical, innovative and to bring the future to you. The prices that we are offering on indiegogo are lower than what we will price for retail, and that is because you are actually supporting the development of this project. If you decide to back Travelmate, then thank you very much for your support!

 
Travelmate isn't just a normal suitcase -- it's an autonomous robot companion that follows you wherever you go and makes traveling much easier. Our suitcase is smart enough to always follow you and avoid any obstacles in its way. Travelmate is perfect for any situation. It can carry your stuff for you when you're going to work, walking to school or rushing to the airport gate. Smart features like omni wheels and our Follow Me system means that Travelmate is at the cutting edge of AI and autonomous movement technology. The Follow Me system has built in sensors that detect as well as avoid obstacles like people and furniture. It uses the Travelmate application to follow you and to better pinpoint its location at all times.

 

 

In addition to fully autonomous horizontal and vertical modes, the Travelmate has a variety of useful features that other suitcases do not have. The battery that powers Travelmate can be easily removed and is charged with wireless technology. The battery can be used to charge almost all electronics through a USB port and a standard electrical outlet. In addition, the Travelmate suitcase features unique omni wheels that allow for unprecedented multi-directional movement. This is crucial for autonomous technology. Since the suitcase functions as a robot in practice, it uses AI and machine learning to optimize its movements and omni wheels allow for markedly increased stability and range of motion that cannot be achieved otherwise.

 
The Travelmate's autonomous functionality is unmatched and doesn't require any extra peripherals. All you need is the suitcase and your smartphone. Travelmate will follow you wherever you go. Whether you're at the airport, going to work or going to school; the Travelmate suitcase can help you carry luggage in a wide variety of situations.
 Travelmate has a battery life of 4 hours when in full autonomous mode and up to 100 hours in stand by mode (meaning when you are using it like a normal suitcase). The electric motor and internal components that enable autonomous functionality take up almost no space in the suitcase, accounting for less than 5% of the suitcase's volume. Multi colored LED lighting is a feature on all Travelmate models and signifies your suitcase's battery level. You can customize or turn off all LED lighting through the Travelmate application. The Travelmate suitcase features convenient directional indicators that show you exactly where it's going at all times. This is similar to turn signals in cars. We've also added a speaker that will inform you of obstacles and the suitcase's location – this feature is completely optional and you can turn it on or off in the Travelmate application. In addition to autonomy, we've tried to differentiate ourselves with convenient features that most other smart suitcases do not have. The Travelmate has a unique handle that turns into a portable desk that you can use for laptops, books, documents and many other things. In addition, the Travelmate has an easily accessible separate compartment that allows you to store valuables that you might need to take out of the suitcase. This compartment is perfect for things like passports and portable electronics. Travelmate is fully TSA compliant and our suitcase sizes are standardized. The smallest Travelmate is carry on sized and fits the specifications of all major airlines' requirements for carry on specifications. The Travelmate has a touch enabled lock system that uses your fingerprint to open your suitcase. In order to comply with TSA guidelines, we have also included a mechanism to manually open the suitcase. You can always add a separate lock to your suitcase for extra security.
(Omni wheels)Travelmate includes a GPS chip that helps orient the suitcase and allows you to know the location of the suitcase at all times with the Travlemate smartphone application. You can remove the GPS chip and use it for other suitcases or attach it to other things that are easily lost. Most other smart suitcases have GPS integration, but none of them allow you to remove it easily. We will also include two extra GPS chips in all Travelmate models, so that you can conveniently track your belongings.All Travelmate models will include a built in scale that will accurately measure the weight of your suitcase's contents. You'll never have to worry about over packing because Travelmate will conveniently display the suitcase's weight. You can switch between Kilograms or Pounds via the Travelmate application. The Travelmate autonomous suitcase is fully functional and we have full app integration ready. Travelmate will constantly improve through machine learning. This is achieved by uploading movement data automatically to the Travelmate application; your suitcase will essentially become smarter and smarter as time goes on and more people have Travelmate suitcases. You can disable this feature in the app if you want to. After it releases, we have plans to update the free Travelmate application regularly to improve and add features. Eventually we want to add things like travel suggestions, airport information, airport gate information and much more to the application.The vast majority of our team consists of robotics specialists and that's very evident when you look at the Travelmate's features. It's far more than just a suitcase. Travelmate has integrated adaptive AI that knows where it's going at all times and adjusts it's movement on the fly. Some examples of other practical applications for the Travelmate are using it as a guide for people who are visually impaired or as a robot friend who can respond to simple commands (you can turn this feature on or off). You can also mount a camera to the Travelmate which can be incredibly useful when you don't have anyone else to film you. We're also adding virtual reality integration to the Travelmate so that people can come with you on your adventures.  Our goal for Travelmate is for it to eventually become the first widely available and affordable robot companion.  The Travelmate application is crucial for this. We're working hard to make it easy to use and feature rich. We think that the best way to make sure that your Travelmate always improves is to give you the freedom to do whatever you want with it. That's why we're making Travelmate open source, so that anyone can look at the underlying software and make improvements or think up of new features. This way, you can add new features to your Travelmate by looking through community mods that people have developed for the Travelmate application.   Travelmate is constantly evolving and has actual artificial intelligence. This is a first for smart suitcases. Travelmate is truly autonomous and improves by looking at data from all other Travelmate suitcases to improve its movement, actions and response time. This principal has been applied before to other technology like Tesla cars, but we are the first to do it for suitcases.  Since Travelmate is autonomous, you can even use it as an impromptu security guard. If you attach a camera to it, you can leave it to patrol your home even when you're not there. There is endless potential to implement more features like this and that's why we call Travelmate a robot companion. We've included a mount in all Travelmate suitcases which will allow you to attach cameras or virtual reality ready cameras to the suitcase. Because of this, you can use the Travelmate as your camera operator. This is perfect for video blogging or for recording yourself and your surroundings.  You can attach a 360 degree VR camera to your Travelmate. • Make VR ready video blogs.
