is fading, and Godzilla is living high off the millions he's made over years of

that have made him who he is today, but <u>they</u> haven’t forgotten <u>him</u>,

is a dark comedy about four has-been movie monsters that have failed in their
screen careers and are now stuck in dead end jobs and poor living conditions to
make ends meet.  While they look and act human, they each have a physical
element to them to insinuate their “monster status” (one has a horn, the other

The age of Japanese movie monsters
is fading, and Godzilla is living high off the millions he's made over years of
trampling Tokyo.  It's been easy for him to forget all the little people
that have made him who he is today, but they haven’t forgotten him,
and some are bearing grudges...
""YOU CAN’T BEAT GODZILLA!""
is a dark comedy about four has-been movie monsters that have failed in their
screen careers and are now stuck in dead end jobs and poor living conditions to
make ends meet.  While they look and act human, they each have a physical
element to them to insinuate their “monster status” (one has a horn, the other
is covered in body hair, etc.)  In a
demented sort of “Wizard of Oz” type scenario, the monsters grow tired of the
poverty and humiliation they've endured and form a plan to find Godzilla, rob
him and bring him down once and for all. 
Their “yellow brick road” presents obstacles, however, and their journey
proves to be more difficult than they all hoped.The play makes numerous references to pop
culture and satirizes the entertainment industry every step of the way.  Audiences will enjoy the show because it
speaks to our greatest fear (failure), and they’ll be particularly entertained
when King Kong, one of the monsters involved in the plan earns a spot on the
game show “The Price is Right.”  The play
calls for multiple viewings and contains humor to fit everyone’s tastes.

through a breakup, casual sex, marriage, being happy with being single and many
other topics are covered in hilarious and, at times, tear-jerking ways. </p>

Festival under special permission from DaPoPo Theatre.

Theatre is an ad-hoc group of professional artists producing this new version of a Canadian musical. So... What About Love?  was originally presented by DaPoPo Theatre in Halifax, Nova
Scotia. Its first incarnation was created in just five days and presented in the
Atlantic Fringe Festival. This production will mark its
first performance on the west coast, as well as its first performance by
another theatre company, arranged through special permission from DaPoPo
Theatre. Both groups believe it is important for this piece to be performed to a new audience, with a new set of artists, and with further revisions in order to continue to develop the show. Throughout the process, Garry Williams (one of the show's creators and the artistic director of DaPoPo Theatre) will be working with Ambushed Theatre to revise and tweak the show. Read
on, to learn what you can help bring to life on stage. 
So...What About Love? follows three actors presenting a series of songs, scenes and
monologues discussing different topics about love. Meeting someone new, getting
through a breakup, casual sex, marriage, being happy with being single and many
other topics are covered in hilarious and, at times, tear-jerking ways. 
With an awesome script, a talented cast and some brilliant collaboration, we
plan to pull this off without a hitch! The only place we fall short, is our
financials. In order to continue production of our show we need to cover the
expenses. Here's what we need to achieve.
$600
– Victoria Fringe Fee
$150
– Sets/Props/Costumes
$200
-  Marketing/Printing Fees
$1050
– Artist Fees
$2000 - Total
Our
costs are very humble, as it is a very minimalistic show. However, we still
need all the support we can get to offset the costs. You can get
some great rewards for donating, too!

<p>As we all know a Yes vote this September is
vital.</p>
<p>Like you, I have been doing everything I
can to bring about the transformation that Scotland needs. Along with thousands
of fellow activists, I’ve been charging about the country shouting my face off
about the benefits of independence, at rallies and meetings and events from
Orkney to Oban, St Andrews to Stirling. None of us make any money from such things; any we do make
usually goes straight back into the pot.<span> 
You’ll only ever hear me do one yell out for financial aid and here it
is: </span></p>
<p>please help me fund a play I intend to
stage at the Edinburgh Fringe this August - a month ahead of the referendum -
rallying for a Yes vote.</p>
<p>The play is called <b><i>The Pure, the Dead
and the Brilliant</i></b>, and it’s a cracker (he said,
modestly). It’s heartfelt, it’s steeped in Scottish folklore, it takes a long
hard look at the referendum whilst also (hopefully) making you laugh till you
cry. The idea is to bring Don’t
Knows closer to the Yes side, whilst also giving everyone a damn good night out
at the theatre. The script is written, and we’ve got a venue and a cast of some
of the best actors in Scotland (seriously – some BRILLIANT people involved).
All we need is confirmation of the funds. </p>
<p>I’m personally taking no payment for the
script, and will be putting quite a bit of my own money into the
production.<span>  But I can’t expect
actors, a director, a venue, a costume designer, technicians and
leaflet-printers to do the same! 
These things have to be paid for, and I can’t afford them all.</span></p>
<p>So if you can share this post far and wide
with your Yes-supporting friends it will help make possible my own big, final

has to say about the biggest issue we’ve all faced in three hundred years.</p>

<h2>Summary:</h2>
<p><strong>Please support Conspire Theatre’s life-changing workshops for women inside the Travis County Correctional Complex. </strong></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.conspiretheatre.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Conspire Theatre</a>, a sponsored project of the <a href=""http://www.austincreativealliance.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Austin Creative Alliance</a>, offers incarcerated women and their allies a healing and empowering experience through theatre and creative writing. For three years, we’ve been running <em>Rehearsing Possibilities, </em>a successful theatre and creative writing program for women in minimum and maximum security at the Travis County Correctional Complex (TCCC) near Austin, Texas.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Thanks to last year's campaign, this year we served more women than ever before.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Rosa, a Conspire alum, says:</strong></p>
<p><em>I know how powerful your class was for me and I believe that other women just like myself could use someone to believe in them… [Conspire] unlocks doors that have been locked for so many years and allows us to be who we really are. My confidence, since truly opening up in Conspire, has helped me through some rough, emotional, lonely times. </em></p>
<p>Since 2009, we’ve brought creative expression and hope to over 200 incarcerated women, expanded our programming, and are working to gain independent 501c3 status. We did this all on a shoestring budget, donating our skills and services for many months at a time, while working other jobs.</p>
<p align=""center""><strong><em>IMAGINE what we could do if we had more funding?</em></strong></p>
<p>We need YOUR help to keep our momentum strong. To continue our programs for another twelve months, we must raise $6,000 to pay our highly skilled workshop facilitators, purchase class supplies, and apply to be our own 501c3. Many women need the unique services that Conspire offers.</p>
<h2><strong>Our Story:</strong></h2>
<p>In 2008, Executive Director Kat Craft trained with the London based company Clean Break, which offers theatre programming to incarcerated women in the UK. Inspired by Clean Break’s positive impact on women’s lives, she returned to Austin and founded Conspire Theatre in the summer of 2009.<br/><strong> <br/></strong>Associate Director Michelle Dahlenburg came on board in July of 2011, and really helped Conspire step up its game. Through Kat and Michelle’s combined efforts, Conspire has served over two hundred women in Austin and Del Valle, has a new website, a new logo, been featured several times in Austin media, and is well on its way to having a comprehensive curriculum tailored to incarcerated women’s needs – and that’s just since last October!</p>
<h2><strong>Community Impact:</strong></h2>
<p>Texas currently incarcerates over 12,000 women, many of whom have experienced childhood abuse and domestic violence. Criminal justice scholar Dana DeHart states, ""programs suited for men often fail to address the pervasive physical and sexual victimization that has riddled the lives of women in prison.”</p>
<p>Incarcerated women need support services that mitigate the effects of trauma and stress, allow for community building, and focus on future success in parenting, career, and relationships. Programs tailored to address these needs are often discontinued for budgetary reasons. The vast majority of incarcerated women are released back into society still lacking the skills and support systems they need.</p>
<p>Conspire Theatre provides incarcerated women with this support by working to build a supportive and safe community in which women can reach beyond their past experiences, and work together to create creative solutions and effective coping skills.</p>
<p>The population we reach at the TCCC is largely underserved. In our 2012 program year, 94% of our workshop attendees did not graduate from college and 38% did not complete high school. 79% were mothers, and 4% were pregnant while incarcerated.In 2011-2012, 30% of women in Conspire were Latina, 35% were Caucasian and 22% were African-American, along with smaller percentages of Middle Eastern, Asian and ethnically mixed women. Most were awaiting trial or serving short-term sentences for nonviolent, substance abuse related offenses.</p>

<h3>The Impact:</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>HNDC and Director Michelle Fletcher have tackled many dance for camera films, but none have felt as important as this project. There are many dance students out there (NYC, San Francisco, London, etc...) who do not know who Dan Wagoner is. Yet he is part of them, influencing the way they move at this very moment. Which leads to the core thrust of this project - Mentorship/dance parent vs. emulation vs. dance appropriation - all just acts of love? This dance film is a love letter to Dan and all those who crave to have a tangible artifact of him, besides their own body memory of what Dan has taught us.</p>
</div>
<h3>Who's Involved:</h3>
<div><strong>Michelle Fletcher - Director/Choreographer</strong></div>
<div>Fletcher lives in San Francisco, participating fully in the SF art community as a choreographer, director, student, teacher, and writer. Fletcher founded Here Now Dance Collective in 2008 and consistently creates new work with the company.

There are many dance students out there (NYC, San Francisco, London, etc...) who do not know who Dan Wagoner is. Yet he is part of them, influencing the way they move at this very moment. Which leads to the core thrust of this project - Mentorship/dance parent vs. emulation vs. dance appropriation - all just acts of love? This dance film is a love letter to Dan and all those who crave to have a tangible artifact of him, besides their own body memory of what Dan has taught us.

Who's Involved:
Michelle Fletcher - Director/Choreographer
Fletcher lives in San Francisco, participating fully in the SF art community as a choreographer, director, student, teacher, and writer. Fletcher founded Here Now Dance Collective in 2008 and consistently creates new work with the company. Recognized for her multi-media, post-modern ""dance-theater"" work that often explores themes personal to ""the human experience"" her company (HNDC) is engaged to perform across the country.  Fletcher has received prestigious awards including The Zellerbach Family Foundation Grant, The Margaret Jenkins’ Dance Lab CHIME Grant and The Graduate Teaching Award from Florida State University.  Fletcher received her BFA from North Carolina School of the Arts and her MFA from Florida State University. Matt Barkin - Film-maker/CollaboratorBarkin lives and works in San Francisco where he has produced film and video work ranging from documentaries and promotional videos to short and feature narrative films. He is now attending the Academy of Art, pursuing his MFA in Directing and managing his own business - Vibrant Films.



Michelle Kinny - Dancer/CollaboratorKinny received her BFA in dance from Florida State University and her high school diploma from North Carolina School of the Arts. Upon completion of her administrative internship with the Mark Morris Dance Group, she was involved in a variety of companies and projects in NYC including Vessel Dance and Fusion Danceworks. Before relocating to San Francisco, Kinny worked in an orphanage in Huancayo, Peru teaching dance and yoga. Matthew Lewis - Film-maker/Photographer/CollaboratorLewis first fell in love with photography hand developing his prints in the dark room. After graduating with a degree in Film from Full Sail University in Orlando, FL, Lewis made his way back home to California. Currently, Lewis works as a lighting technician and designer for the production company Lights West. Lewis also freelances as a photographer, camera man, and media designer.  

 
Andrew Chapman - Dancer/Collaborator

Chapman received his BFA from the School of Dance at Florida State University and currently works as a free lance dancer in NYC. During his time at FSU, Chapman was able to perform Wagoner's ""Round This World Baby Mine"" which makes working on this project a very special endeavor. Andy thanks Michelle Fletcher for being a sassy, diva Leo and for including him on this adventure to the home of their favorite West Virginia Man.

</h3> <p>Everyone has been Derrick -  naive, young, idealistic, romantic, and new to love.  And if you haven't been Derrick, you've been Tristan - sensible, cynical, and on the road to success, but afraid to let love pass him by.  <i>Chasing Heroes</i> explores the relationships we've been in by showing us two guys who are still in trapped in one, surrounded by swirling emotions and sexual temptations.<br/></p>
<p>We're booked for three shows on Wed Aug 27, Thurs Aug 28, and Fri Aug 29 at 6:30 PM with a fantastic little theater space in the heart of New York City:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Manhattan Repertory Theatre</p>
<p>303 W. 42nd St, 6th Floor, NYC, NY 10036<br/></p>
</blockquote>
</div><h3>The Third and a Half Wall</h3><div>A big part of <i>Chasing Heroes</i> is the framing.  Derrick and Tristan are actually each played by two actors.  Derrick and Tristan narrate the action joined by three companions who help them work through their problems - largely by calling them out their bad decisions.  To aid in the discussion, they summon Avatars, past embodiments of themselves, who live out the romance as it goes on.  Both the current and past incarnations of Derrick and Tristan can be on stage at the same time, really allowing us to explore metatheatricality in the piece.  It lets us bring the characters to life in a new way.<br/><br/>Another aspect of <i>Chasing Heroes</i> is a rotating act structure.  Because it's all about building a picture of a full relationship between Derrick and Tristan, Derrick will be the protagonist of the first act for the Wed Aug 27th performance, while Tristan will be the protagonist of the first act for the Thurs Aug 28th performance.  The last performance's act order will be determined closer to the show.  We think that this structure will give a unique experience based on which act order you see.<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Where Your Donation Goes<br/>
</h3> <p>There's a reason starving artists are a stereotype!  Everything in the theater world costs money, and the cast and crew are donating their time and talent.  But not everything can be donated.  Scripts, costuming, props, and space rentals all cost money.  Even better, we'd like to hire a publicist capable of helping us get the attention of field professionals -- reviewers, producers, agents, etc.  We've got a full cast and crew of talented people, and we'd like the opportunity to get noticed!</p>
<p>The base line will help us give our cast the best opportunities possible, but we're hoping to exceed our goals.  Ultimately, we'd like to remount the production for a larger run in a bigger space, using as many of the cast as possible.  Exceeding our goals will allow us to buy better props and set pieces, invite more industry guests, and maybe even give a stipend to our actors.  The more we raise, the better chance we have of giving back to the creative people who are making this happen!</p>

<h2><strong>THE GREAT MacDADDY is BACK...35 years later!</strong></h2>
<p>One of the sexiest, funniest, and most ground breaking theatrical experiences to ever hit New York is BACK after 35 years and IT'S BETTER THAN EVER!!! Before there was Hip Hop, there was <em>The Great MacDaddy</em>. Considered one of the Negro Ensemble Company’s classic works, <em>The Great MacDaddy, </em>written by Paul Carter Harrison, was last staged at the Theatre De Lys in 1977, and is now being revived 35 years later for the enjoyment of a whole new generation! Through your donations Korner Theatricals, Alfred Preisser, Diane Batson and the Negro Ensemble Company in association with Jaylene Clark, The Hip Hop Theatre Festival, Freedome Bradley and The City Parks Foundation will present this great work at the 777 Theatre this fall (November). In this world of virtual reality that isn’t real, we want to pay homage to the rich oral tradition of story-telling through African-American folklore!</p>
<h2><strong>What is <em>The Great MacDaddy</em>?</strong></h2>

<p><em>The Great MacDaddy</em> is a play-with-music that resurrects many of the fabled heroes of the urban storytelling tradition, including Shine, Stagolee, and the Signifyin’ Monkey.  It is a satirical romp driven by a funky Music characterization that advances the story of a young, egotistical MacDaddy, the beneficiary of his father’s illegal booze fortune during Prohibition, who crosses the American landscape on an odyssey in search of Wine, the custodian of the formula for his father’s legacy.  It is a Time-travel odyssey across the United States in the 20th Century that has the young, self-indulgent MacDaddy discovering a world of hostilities where he encounters many cautionary trials and tribulations until he discovers Wine among the ancestors in the South and becomes enlightened with a spiritual wisdom he must share with his people in the 21st Century. It is the conclusion of an often humorously raucous, yet captivating journey that galvanizes the audience to a sense of collective celebration.</p>
<h2><strong>Production History</strong></h2>
<p>When this play was originally produced in 1974 by the Negro Ensemble Company, the stellar cast included legendary actors and actresses such as Phylicia Rashad, Hattie Winston, Cleavon Little, and the late, great Al Freeman, Jr..</p>

<p>Phylicia Rashad has this to say about <em>The Great MacDaddy</em> today:</p>
<p><em>“‘The Great MacDaddy” is as relevant today as when it debuted at the Negro Ensemble Theater over thirty years ago.  Come and enjoy this revival!""</em></p>
<p>Hattie Winston says this:</p>
<p><em>“How thrilled I am to know that the Negro Ensemble is once again mounting Paul Carter Harrison's 'The Great MacDaddy.' All those years ago when I was in the original production with actors such as Al Freeman, Jr., I had no idea that we were participating in an historical event.  I had no idea, although I should have suspected it, that ‘The Great MacDaddy’ would inspire, thrive, live on and take its place in the canon of African American Theatrical Literature. I am so very pleased to know that a new generation of theatre-goers will be able to take this journey through the history of a people. My people.</em></p>
<h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
<p>For hundreds of years it was the oral tradition that defined a culture, maintained an identity, and passed along the history of a people for generations. Through <em>The Great MacDaddy</em> we want to bring the excitement of storytelling to the 21<sup>st</sup> century. For 2 hours and 30 minutes we want the audience to be swept up in the music, mesmerized by the dance, entertained by the raucous humor, and engrossed in classic urban folktales with a modern twist. Paul Carter Harrison is a phenomenal playwright and with your help we can revive his great work and show the world once again why The Great MacDaddy is the “greatest MacDaddy of all the MacDaddies who can do anything in this world!”</p>

THE GREAT MacDADDY is BACK...35 years later!
One of the sexiest, funniest, and most ground breaking theatrical experiences to ever hit New York is BACK after 35 years and IT'S BETTER THAN EVER!!! Before there was Hip Hop, there was The Great MacDaddy. Considered one of the Negro Ensemble Company’s classic works, The Great MacDaddy, written by Paul Carter Harrison, was last staged at the Theatre De Lys in 1977, and is now being revived 35 years later for the enjoyment of a whole new generation! Through your donations Korner Theatricals, Alfred Preisser, Diane Batson and the Negro Ensemble Company in association with Jaylene Clark, The Hip Hop Theatre Festival, Freedome Bradley and The City Parks Foundation will present this great work at the 777 Theatre this fall (November). In this world of virtual reality that isn’t real, we want to pay homage to the rich oral tradition of story-telling through African-American folklore!

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Anthony McDonald and Jiles King are both currently students at Columbia University as candidates for a Master's in Theater Management and Producing.  For Anthony McDonald this is his first time producing a theatrical show.   Which as one can imagine he is learning a whole lot!  Jiles King on the other hand is a seasoned Producer who has been producing his own shows for a few years now, based out of Texas. Now they are both at Columbia producing the Colored Museum together.  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>They both share a passion for producing work by people of color that comment on the Black experience.  When thinking about plays and stories to do, when the Colored Museum came up they both knew this was the one that we would collaborate on in order to spark a dialogue on the campus of Columbia about race and race matters in America.  <br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Play<br/>
</h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">George C. Wolfe's THE COLORED MUSEUM is a in-your-face story that fixates the black experience and forces you to re-evaluate everything you have ever known.  From a historical perspective, living in a world
with the first Black President, the conversation about race is evermore present
and on one’s mind.  The issues that the Colored Museum addresses resonate just
as much today as they did in 1985.  The
stereotypes that have existed over time are thought to be diluted and
gone.  But are they really?  This show opens and gives a platform to
discuss this issue across racial lines. 
By using satirical comedy to display the stereotypes it allows it to be
introduced in a non-confrontational arena.  <span style='font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: ""Times New Roman"",""serif"";'><span style=""""><br/></span></span></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><br/></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">From a personal viewpoint, now in my 2nd
year at Columbia University, I have noticed the lack of diversity in the plays
presented on campus.  I want to create theater that ""theatricalizes"" the Black experience which could be focusing on African Americans, to West Indians, Africans or whomever identifies as Black in the world.  With the current commercial  theater landscape in America lacking diversity, by the plays being produced that were written by people of color, it fuels my desire to create or produce the diversity that I would like to
see.  As President Obama stated, “Change
will not come if we wait for some other person, or if we wait for some other
time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that we seek. The Colored Museum is that change. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3> When and Where</h3>

</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The performances will take place at the Glicker-Milstein Theater on the campus of Barnard College, NYC which is located in the Diana

Since then, he's been around the city at Comdy Period, Sketch Block, Soul Glo, Skinny Bitch Jesus Meeting's Daddy's Basement, The Trachtenburg Variety Hour, and several other comedy and variety shows. He's still unsure why he continues to be booked for comedy shows.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In December 2010, Umberto performed in a special showcase at Horse Trade Theater Group's Kraine Theater.  Competing against 15 other shows, he won one of the three slots at Horse Trade's MiniFRIDGE festival to perform an hour long show of his very own called The Terrible Manpain of Umberto MacDougal, starring Emleigh Wolf and Mike Ogletree and directed by Bricken Sparacino.  After that successful run, Umberto won a lottery allowing him a spot in the main Horse Trade FRIGID Festival. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Most people know me as Burgundy Brixx - burlesque artist, producer and educator. I hold a BA in theatre arts with a minor in dance, and worked for over 10 years in New York as a theatre artist.</p>
<p>And then I found Burlesque.</p>
<p>I became extremely impassioned not only for the burlessque revival, but for uncovering and researching the history of this ""bastard child of american theatre"". For everyone who's ever felt like a misfit, being chastised for enjoying honest, bawdy, sexy humour that's not airbrushed into false perfection, burlesque is a much-needed oasis in today's world. A place of acceptance and joy.</p>
<p>I see burlesque as not just a sub-section of theatre or dance, but as its own unique artform. By delving into its rich and colorful history and presenting it onstage in a historic homage to its humanity, we hope to show as many people as possible that burlesque is worthy of artistic appreciation and enjoyment by everyone, not just the fringe of society.</p>
<p>And the opportunity to be a part of the Vancouver Fringe Festival is the perfect next step in this project realizing its dream.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We just mounted a mini version of this production for the Vancouver International Burlesque Festival to amazing response. But of course it left our cupboards bare. However, having this opportunity to be a part of the Fringe Fest suddeny presented to us is something we can't say no to, so we're on the hunt to raise funds for our fee to participate in the Vancouver Fringe Festival (a not-for profit orgainization) - $750.00</p>
<p><br/>That's not much at all, and it gives us an amazing venue we could not afford otherwise, plus the support and publicity of the Vancouver Fringe Festival and its affiliates.</p>
<p><br/>We plan to reach our goal! These funds will go 100% into the mounting of the full version production!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I've been passionate about uncovering the real Gypsy Rose Lee for many years. As an important historical figure from right here in the pacific northwest, I feel it's important for  more people to really get to know her and understand her impact on the world today. As well as her huge contribution to the burlesque revival as we know it.</p>
<p>I moved to Vancouver in 2008 and began producing a little burlesque cabaret called Kitty Nights. Five years later, I'm still producing that hugely successful weekly show which has garnerd accolades and awards from WE Vancouver, Yelp, Lonely Planet and more. It has become the most popular burlesque show in Canada, and is a major part of the Biltmore Cabaret's business success. It also has given burlesque artists in Vancouver a place to work, hone their craft and share a sense of community within this art form.</p>
<p>My hope is to use my skills in partnership with LiveStage Performance and Pandora and the Locksmiths to bring this production, and the art of burlesque, out into the limelight for a new demographic of theatre-goers to truly appreciate, and by that mark, help burlesque artists and shows everywhere find more new audiences and sustainability for their passion!</p>

<p>Intertwining several artists from a wide array of mediums to create a truly inspired, passionate piece of art. </p>
<p>March 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2013</p>
<p>Sharon Disney Lund Theatre</p>
<p> </p>
<div class=""description_wrapper"">
<div class=""description"">
<p class=""first"">Flight is a one act circus opera consisting of two parts. The first part is animation projected onto circus silks depicting a tale of a magical orchard that blooms women. When a king comes to capture the beautiful ladies they barely escape. All except one.</p>
<p>The second part is a live performance about this same woman who is now the queen and the relationship she forces with a bird played by Katie Gardner on trapeze.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id=""tools""> </div>
<h3><strong>Meet the Production Team:</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Katie Lynn Gardner </strong>- Creator, Choreographer, Performer</p>
<p>I am a vocalist, aerialist, and writer originally from Massillon, OH. Currently, I am earning my MFA in Vocal Performance from California Institute of the Arts. I am passionate about incorporating various aspects of circus disciplines and theatrical elements into my original works, whether they be solo vocal performances or full scale musical productions.  My inspiration comes from research into circus history, vocal performance history, folklore, and cognition studies. Recent performances/ contracts include Disney Cruise Lines, Disneyland Parks and Resort, REDCAT, Highways at Santa Monica, and The Hammer Museum. I graduated from Kent State University with a BA in English Literature with minors in Music and Political Science.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Marissa Galin </strong>- Creative &amp; Technical Director, Co-Producer</p>
<p>Marissa Galin is passionate about creating immersive art inspired by the beauty of the human body and human interaction.  Being engrossed in fine arts and martial arts at a young age, she developed an early understanding of an innate need for artistic expression.  She finally found a home in theatre and has since worn many different creative, managerial or technical hats of responsibility.  This led to exposure in film, circus and themed entertainment. She most recently interned at Stage Technologies Inc. in Las Vegas as a Mechanical Engineering Intern.  Marissa is in her last year of study at California Institute of the Arts as a BFA candidate in Technical Design &amp; Direction and is currently Technical Director on a CalArts Theatre School Production of Eugene O'Neal's <em>Long Days Journey into Night. </em>Marissa has been working closely with Katie to help realize the vision of <em>Flight </em>and is incredibly excited to bring it to the CalArts community.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Erica Larsen-Dockray </strong>- Animator and Video Designer</p>
<p>Erica Larsen-Dockray is a Nebraskan native with interests in projection as a medium and issues dealing with gender, sex, age, and other human rights.  She has studied both Graphic Design and Painting and Drawing at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.  In 2003 she received a BA in Animation and Media Arts from the Art Institute of Phoenix and in 2009 a BFA and a MFA in Experimental Animation and Integrated Media from the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) in 2012. Erica has travelled the world making wacky collaborative works  and installations involving animation, video, painting, dance, live music, games, dark rides, interactive stations, performance, and beyond.  She loves candy coating dark issues and play as a device to spark discussion and involvement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Daphne Mir</strong> - Lighting Designer</p>
<p>Daphne is enthusiastic about the creation of immersive experiences and spectacles. Her first foray in to intimate spectacles at CalArts took the form of a theatrical magic show she wrote, designed, and performed in, ""How To Make a Magician Disappear."" While studying abroad at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, Daphne had the opportunity to collaborate with Circus Arts for the first time. Daphne is expected to graduate this May with her BFA from CalArts. Daphne is inspired by the serendipitous path these experiences have formed, and is looking forward to bringing the knowledge and passion from them to create the fascinating and intensely beautiful world of Flight! Her design for Flight draws inspiration from hiking in the misty, gently metallic light of Scotland, where from castles, forests, and places of fantasy materialize. Dancing with the shadow-puppet like aspects of the animation, textures and meticulously crafted shadows will wrap their wings around the world of aerial displays and musical wonder. She is excited to expand the beautiful, two-dimensional imagery the team is creating through projection in to a cohesive world for the performers to take flight in. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Adeline Newmann </strong>- Video Programmer</p>
<p><strong>Jaqueline Adair </strong>- Costume Designer</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Greenberg </strong>- Assistant Technical Director</p>
<p><strong>Lauren Davis </strong> - Performer (The Queen)</p>
<p><strong>Marc Chernoff</strong> - Aerial Rigger, Performer (The Bird Outside)</p>
<p><strong>Chris Burnett </strong>- Poster Designer</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Andrea Young </strong>- Co-composer</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Charles Underriner </strong>- Co-composer</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Hannah Dexter </strong>- Viola</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Jarrett Furst</strong>- Cello</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Henry Webster </strong>- Violin</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Why We Need Your Money: </strong></h3>
<p>The more money we receive, the more elaborate our designs can be.</p>
<p>No matter how much we raise, all funds will go towards the design to bring <em>Flight</em> to life.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scenic</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>We are using various aerial rigging apparatuses, and they don't come cheap. The design calls for 4 aerial silks and a static trapeze. Aside from the normal use you would expect to get out of an aerial silk, we plan to use white, stretch silks as projection screens. This means we also need the proper hardware to stretch the bottom of the silks on the ground (which we cannot in any way affix into) while the silk hangs from proper silk hardware. Additionally, we need to buy all new span sets and carabineers for safety.</li>
<li>Additionally, Marissa is designing a 24', climbable, moveable, modular A-Frame ladder apparatus that will be used for acrobatics and choreography. To speak a bit further, the ladder must be modular to fit out of the 10’ shop doors and be assembled or raised in the space. Ideally the entire structure will be on casters for movement in the show, and all must be structural enough to withstand dynamic forces from the acrobatics. Meaning, in short hand; $$$.</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Lighting</strong></li>

<h2><strong>Thank you!!!</strong></h2></div>","Flight: An Original CalArts Circus Opera
Intertwining several artists from a wide array of mediums to create a truly inspired, passionate piece of art. 
March 23rd, 2013
Sharon Disney Lund Theatre
 


Flight is a one act circus opera consisting of two parts. The first part is animation projected onto circus silks depicting a tale of a magical orchard that blooms women. When a king comes to capture the beautiful ladies they barely escape. All except one.
The second part is a live performance about this same woman who is now the queen and the relationship she forces with a bird played by Katie Gardner on trapeze.


 
Meet the Production Team:
Katie Lynn Gardner - Creator, Choreographer, Performer
I am a vocalist, aerialist, and writer originally from Massillon, OH. Currently, I am earning my MFA in Vocal Performance from California Institute of the Arts. I am passionate about incorporating various aspects of circus disciplines and theatrical elements into my original works, whether they be solo vocal performances or full scale musical productions.  My inspiration comes from research into circus history, vocal performance history, folklore, and cognition studies. Recent performances/ contracts include Disney Cruise Lines, Disneyland Parks and Resort, REDCAT, Highways at Santa Monica, and The Hammer Museum. I graduated from Kent State University with a BA in English Literature with minors in Music and Political Science.
 
Marissa Galin - Creative & Technical Director, Co-Producer
Marissa Galin is passionate about creating immersive art inspired by the beauty of the human body and human interaction.  Being engrossed in fine arts and martial arts at a young age, she developed an early understanding of an innate need for artistic expression.  She finally found a home in theatre and has since worn many different creative, managerial or technical hats of responsibility.  This led to exposure in film, circus and themed entertainment. She most recently interned at Stage Technologies Inc. in Las Vegas as a Mechanical Engineering Intern.  Marissa is in her last year of study at California Institute of the Arts as a BFA candidate in Technical Design & Direction and is currently Technical Director on a CalArts Theatre School Production of Eugene O'Neal's Long Days Journey into Night. Marissa has been working closely with Katie to help realize the vision of Flight and is incredibly excited to bring it to the CalArts community.
 
Erica Larsen-Dockray - Animator and Video Designer
Erica Larsen-Dockray is a Nebraskan native with interests in projection as a medium and issues dealing with gender, sex, age, and other human rights.  She has studied both Graphic Design and Painting and Drawing at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.  In 2003 she received a BA in Animation and Media Arts from the Art Institute of Phoenix and in 2009 a BFA and a MFA in Experimental Animation and Integrated Media from the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) in 2012. Erica has travelled the world making wacky collaborative works  and installations involving animation, video, painting, dance, live music, games, dark rides, interactive stations, performance, and beyond.  She loves candy coating dark issues and play as a device to spark discussion and involvement.
 
Daphne Mir - Lighting Designer
Daphne is enthusiastic about the creation of immersive experiences and spectacles. Her first foray in to intimate spectacles at CalArts took the form of a theatrical magic show she wrote, designed, and performed in, ""How To Make a Magician Disappear."" While studying abroad at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, Daphne had the opportunity to collaborate with Circus Arts for the first time. Daphne is expected to graduate this May with her BFA from CalArts. Daphne is inspired by the serendipitous path these experiences have formed, and is looking forward to bringing the knowledge and passion from them to create the fascinating and intensely beautiful world of Flight! Her design for Flight draws inspiration from hiking in the misty, gently metallic light of Scotland, where from castles, forests, and places of fantasy materialize. Dancing with the shadow-puppet like aspects of the animation, textures and meticulously crafted shadows will wrap their wings around the world of aerial displays and musical wonder. She is excited to expand the beautiful, two-dimensional imagery the team is creating through projection in to a cohesive world for the performers to take flight in. 
 
Adeline Newmann - Video Programmer
Jaqueline Adair - Costume Designer
Daniel Greenberg - Assistant Technical Director
Lauren Davis  - Performer (The Queen)
Marc Chernoff - Aerial Rigger, Performer (The Bird Outside)
Chris Burnett - Poster Designer
Andrea Young - Co-composer
Charles Underriner - Co-composer
Hannah Dexter - Viola
Jarrett Furst- Cello
Henry Webster - Violin
 
Why We Need Your Money: 
The more money we receive, the more elaborate our designs can be.
No matter how much we raise, all funds will go towards the design to bring Flight to life.

Scenic

We are using various aerial rigging apparatuses, and they don't come cheap. The design calls for 4 aerial silks and a static trapeze. Aside from the normal use you would expect to get out of an aerial silk, we plan to use white, stretch silks as projection screens. This means we also need the proper hardware to stretch the bottom of the silks on the ground (which we cannot in any way affix into) while the silk hangs from proper silk hardware. Additionally, we need to buy all new span sets and carabineers for safety.
Additionally, Marissa is designing a 24', climbable, moveable, modular A-Frame ladder apparatus that will be used for acrobatics and choreography. To speak a bit further, the ladder must be modular to fit out of the 10’ shop doors and be assembled or raised in the space. Ideally the entire structure will be on casters for movement in the show, and all must be structural enough to withstand dynamic forces from the acrobatics. Meaning, in short hand; $$$.

Lighting

We plan to use CalArts stock equipment, but because there are often 6 productions going on at once, it leaves us with limited supply. With more money we could have the opportunity for rental packages that would help us achieve a gorgeous morning light look, or in contrast a dark, shadowy forest atmosphere.
Coupled with the lighting, we are incredibly interested in a low-lying haze effect, and hope to raise enough money to use dry ice for tech rehearsal and productions.







Costumes

The costume design is made up of full body suits to completely transform the performers into their characters. Feathers (rather expensive themselves), airy fabrics, to create brilliant bird inspired creatures.



Producing

We want to get the word out! We have a fantastic CalArts graphic design student, Chris Burnett, creating a production poster to help publicize the event! We need money to provide him with materials to make and get copies.
Additionally, we are interested in creating a single page, no fold program to credit everyone on all the wonderful work they will be doing, and to thank all of YOU for donating to our cause!

Circus productions are rarely if ever done at CalArts, and we are hoping this production sparks interest into such a fantastic and expressive art form.
Help us bring Circus Arts to CalArts!
Any and All contributions will help! Please help us turn our vision into a reality!
If you are interested in helping us but can't spare the cash, help us get the word out! Make some noise and tell your friends!

<h3>Our Company</h3>
<p><strong>A Company of Some </strong>is named after the late Canadian actor - and great uncle of our producer/playwright - Daniel Hyatt's internationally touring solo company: <strong>A Company of One</strong>. It was Daniel's practice to take well know literary works and adapt them to the stage. <strong>A Company of Some </strong>continues this tradition by re-imagining the classic ""Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe"" nursery rhyme as a macabre thriller. We are fortunate enough to have partnered with the Bata Shoe Museum, who are generally hosting us for the run of the festival.</p>
<h3>Our Production</h3>
<p><i>Mrs. Mama's House </i>is nursery rhyme magic with a Grimm twist. The show was conceived out of a fever dream and a deadline. The initial 15 minute script has been expanded and workshopped across various University of Toronto Festivals and is ready to take the Fringe this summer.</p>
<p>This absurd retelling of the ""Old Woman who Lived in a Shoe"" nursery rhyme looks at what happens when an institution has ""too many children"" and ""doesn't know what to do"". The show takes place in a home where shoes are prized possessions and treated as invaluable collector's items. By teaming up with the Bata Shoe Museum, we are staging a site-informed show in an exhibit where shoes are placed behind glass on literal pedestals. There will be a layered approach to this production, where the work informs the space and the space likewise informs the work.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Goal</h3>
<p>We want to share this off-kilter adventure with as many audiences as we can, and we could use your help to make that happen. Our goal is to produce some intrepid work on a shoestring budget, thereby sending our box office earnings directly into the pockets of our performers. We also aim to ensure that our collaborating designers are fairly compensated for their efforts. We are seeking your support to help facilitate this process.</p>
<p>Artists fees aside, our budget is allocated thusly:</p>
<ul>
<li>$1200 for rehearsal space</li>
<li>$700 for creative contracts (designers, photographers, etc.)</li>
<li>$600 for administrative and promotional costs</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p>Any additional donations will also go directly to supporting our wonderful creative team of artists.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Since shoes are such an important part of the design of this show, we are also accepting in kind donations of old shoes to decorate our space. If you have any old shoes or boots in need of a new home, please contact us at companyofsome@gmail.com. After the show's run, we will be contacting a local organization to re-donate these shoes to Torontonians in need of footwear. </p>
<p>If you are unable to contribute financially, sharing this campaign would be a help in and of itself. Feel free to use the hashtag #MamasHouseTO. You can also follow us across social media at @SomeCompanyTO. </p>

<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>Hi! We're <b><i>BOO-Arts Productions</i></b> and we are a New York City based independent theatre company.  We are dedicated to creating art which stimulates thought and provokes discussion that deepens relationships within our community.  We have a passion for the classics and philanthropy so it is our great joy to present <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">our annual Holiday Celebration, </span><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>It's a Wonderful Life</b></i><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">, the radio show, which allows us to do a holiday classic while also giving back.  This year we are co-producing our Holiday Celebration with <b>Gotham Radio Theatre</b> presenting <i><b>Rudolph's Tale: A 1964 Christmas</b></i>.  Both Radio Theatre shows will be performed in rep at the Arclight Theatre in New York City on December 13th-15th. <b> A percentage of the proceeds from both performances will be donated to Habitat for Humanity New York City.</b><br/></span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What do we need?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Last year we donated 20% of ticket sales (before paying off production costs) to Habitat for Humanity New York City.  This year we want to do even more.  Ticket sales usually cover the expense of producing a show: theatre rental, marketing, programs, rehearsal space, etc.  With $2,500 raised through this campaign those expenses will be covered right off the bat.  We can then use our ticket sales to pay our actors and team for their work, give more money to Habitat for Humanity New York City, and start off our 2014 season with a nest egg.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What is ""Radio Theatre""?</h3>
<p>Ever wonder how they made radio broadcast performances?  What did the actors with such distinctly characterized voices actually look like?  How did they make all of those sound effects?  We invite you to come watch Radio Theatre and find out!  Join us on our recording studio sound stage to see the cast perform the 1947 Lux Radio Theatre version of It's a Wonderful Life for live broadcast.  See the magic of double (and triple and quadruple and non-conventional) casting at work, enjoy timeless commercial breaks, and watch live foley sound effects being made.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b></b></p><h3><b>Thank you!</b></h3>Thanks for supporting our work!  Radio Theatre is a lost art form and we are excited to be partnering with <b><i>Gotham Radio Theatre</i></b> to bring it back while presenting two holiday classics for a good cause.  We couldn't do it without your patronage and we thank you for contributing in whatever way you can.<br/><p></p>

Thank you!Thanks for supporting our work!  Radio Theatre is a lost art form and we are excited to be partnering with Gotham Radio Theatre to bring it back while presenting two holiday classics for a good cause.  We couldn't do it without your patronage and we thank you for contributing in whatever way you can.

<h2>Introducing Ourselves: </h2>
<p>  We are a group of young twentysomethings in college, and some fresh outta college, looking to create theatre in a way that will give back to the community. Producing Dog Sees God is our first big leap into creating a theatre company (The Fearless Theatre Collabrative) that will focus solely on teenagers. In doing so, we hope to become a theatre for young aspiring actors and actresses in the Chicago community to have a venue and an outlet for performance. We are synching up the themes in the plays we choose to explore with charities that also reflect the issues and topics in our performances. For Dog Sees God we are raising money for the Tyler Clementi Foundation. Tyler was a young musician who attended Rutgers University and was a victim of homophobic bullying that lead to his suicide. The funds for Dog Sees God will not only go to a new up and coming theatre company but to educational partnernships involved in the Tyler Clementi Foundation to raise awarness in our high schools.</p>

<p>Miss Cairo is a london based drag queen, perfoming regularly on the burlesque, cabaret and queer curcuits. She is a queen of gender deception and works heavily on gender perception, centralling her work on the fluidity of gender, oreintation and the harsh reality of saving face.</p>
<p>An all rounder, she sings like an angel, dances like a hooker, and strips like a bottle of turpentine. She is an insatiable host; turning heads, turning people on and turning it out, and has hosted for many fabulous events and prestigeous venues up and down the country. Mss Cairo has also appeared on TV and has many intresting projecs in the pipeline. </p>
<p>As well as performance, Miss Cairo aids and teaches workshops which introduce people into the world of drag and divahood, coaxing people out of thier shells and discovering thier inner fabulousness. Miss Cairos philosophy is that everyone is fabulos, but they may just not kow it yet.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How can you help?</h3>
<p>Although being a drag queen is fun and exciting, it can also be extremely difficult. Whilst we may earn enough for rent money and champagne, a lot of people may not understand that the majotiy of the money earnt has to get invested staright back into costumes, shoes, wigs, makeup and props, some of which are very expensive. In the last two years that Miss Cairo has been building up her career, she has managed to do well with the resources she's had and built up an extensive array of costumes and make up. However, a lot of it isn't perfect enough for a lot of her routines and comperig jobs. </p>
<p>There are two dresses that she would like to purchase in order for her to feel that little bit more special when on stage. </p>
<p>The first is a beautiful, full length red sequin dress that would be perfect for her Jessica Rabbit routine. The dress is priced at £70, but she would also need a new wig costing £60, and make up shoes and accesories which would probably cost aroud £60. If you haven't yet seen the routine, here is a link to a video of said routine...</p>
<p><a href=""http://youtu.be/4MdlPET8xlk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://youtu.be/4MdlPET8xlk</a></p>
<p>I shall be taking this routine to Finland and really want to look fabulous for The Turku Burlesque Festival!</p>
<p>The main reason for this pledge is for a dress she found in a shop yesterday. She hasn't yet got a dress which she sees fit enought to host in, until she found this one pictured. it is perfect for Miss Cairo as it has all the wonderful elements of an egyptian of an ancient egyptian design, the cut is perfect for her figure, and the light gold material highlights her beautifully olive skin tone. When she tried it on, it looked like a bride had just found her perfect wedding dress. The only trouble is, she doesn't have the funds to pay for it. The dress is selling for £295 and they only have one in her size left. It will be sacrilige if she doesn't own this dress. When you see her in it, you'll understand why!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>And why would you want to help?</h3>
<p>Not only would you like to help a drag queen out because you have a large heart, you also want to see photos and videos of her looking beautiful, and see her in shows looking ravishing... </p>
<p>Without the headache of having to worry about making the rent, Miss Cairo can focus on creating more subversive wrk, projects to aid our brothers and sisters in the LGBT community, write scripts for her web series and focus all her energy pushing her work further into making an impact on peoples lives. Having the time to be able to concetrate on the harddwork that goes behind her drag is imperitive, and being helped out with costumes allows her to have the time to carry on creating new work for all of you that love a bit of Cairo!</p></div>","A little bit about the person in need

How can you help?
Although being a drag queen is fun and exciting, it can also be extremely difficult. Whilst we may earn enough for rent money and champagne, a lot of people may not understand that the majotiy of the money earnt has to get invested staright back into costumes, shoes, wigs, makeup and props, some of which are very expensive. In the last two years that Miss Cairo has been building up her career, she has managed to do well with the resources she's had and built up an extensive array of costumes and make up. However, a lot of it isn't perfect enough for a lot of her routines and comperig jobs. 
There are two dresses that she would like to purchase in order for her to feel that little bit more special when on stage. 
The first is a beautiful, full length red sequin dress that would be perfect for her Jessica Rabbit routine. The dress is priced at £70, but she would also need a new wig costing £60, and make up shoes and accesories which would probably cost aroud £60. If you haven't yet seen the routine, here is a link to a video of said routine...
http://youtu.be/4MdlPET8xlk
I shall be taking this routine to Finland and really want to look fabulous for The Turku Burlesque Festival!
The main reason for this pledge is for a dress she found in a shop yesterday. She hasn't yet got a dress which she sees fit enought to host in, until she found this one pictured. it is perfect for Miss Cairo as it has all the wonderful elements of an egyptian of an ancient egyptian design, the cut is perfect for her figure, and the light gold material highlights her beautifully olive skin tone. When she tried it on, it looked like a bride had just found her perfect wedding dress. The only trouble is, she doesn't have the funds to pay for it. The dress is selling for £295 and they only have one in her size left. It will be sacrilige if she doesn't own this dress. When you see her in it, you'll understand why!
 
And why would you want to help?
Not only would you like to help a drag queen out because you have a large heart, you also want to see photos and videos of her looking beautiful, and see her in shows looking ravishing... 
Without the headache of having to worry about making the rent, Miss Cairo can focus on creating more subversive wrk, projects to aid our brothers and sisters in the LGBT community, write scripts for her web series and focus all her energy pushing her work further into making an impact on peoples lives. Having the time to be able to concetrate on the harddwork that goes behind her drag is imperitive, and being helped out with costumes allows her to have the time to carry on creating new work for all of you that love a bit of Cairo!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>What is the project?</strong></p>
<p><i>Restore</i> premieres February 25th, in honor of The National Eating Disorder Association’s (NEDA) Eating Disorder Awareness Week. In a presentation that can be described as interactive therapy, Redeem brings the artist’s healing process to their audience. Borne Dance Company will gather a collective of musicians, speakers, and movers of varying dynamics for an evening of artistic expression and inspiration while simultaneously providing educational resources. The evening will include original works of art from the realms of dance, music, literature and visual art. In the spirit and belief that art should be made accessible to everyone in our communities, admission will be donation-based and all proceeds will go NEDA. Thanks to Indiegogo and donated pieces of art from local artists, we hope to be able to make this event a success.</p>
<p><strong>Why should you help?</strong></p>
<p>In 2015 the first annual Eating Disorder Awareness Show was produced by Borne co-director Katie Kilbourn.  As a recovered bulimic she felt that there was a general misunderstanding and lack of education surrounding severe mental illnesses and wanted to shed light on these topics through artistic expression. Since 2015, the show has increased significantly in size, attendance, interest and  participation. Each year we have experienced a 25% increase in audience attendance, as well as a significant increase in the amount of artists who wish to showcase their work in this event. Eating disorders affect the lives of many people and we realize it is necessary for our community to have a safe place where artists can share their voices on these disorders. We have had audience members from all types of backgrounds at our event from those who had recovered from eating disorders, to those looking for answers and education, and those who were looking to give support and receive inspiration.  While we are thrilled to produce a show that personally touches so many people, we are also faced with the financial difficulties and stress that comes with an increase in production. This year we would like to be able to host guests artists with larger companies as well as rent a larger theater than we have in the past. It is our mission to not take home any proceeds made at this show because we are dedicated to contributing the money made back to NEDA. With the generous help of supporters like you we can rent a larger theater space, afford to host more companies and artists, pay for better marketing material, and pay our artists for their dedicated time, commitment, and energy. With your help we can help share the message that recovery is possible.</p>

For several weeks, the citizens of Boston had been meeting to discuss the landing of the East India Company Tea in Boston Harbor. The Sons of Liberty had requested that the consignees, or wholesalers, resigned their positions and send the tea back to England. This tactic had worked in our sister colonies and any drastic action was avoided. The Boston consignees refused to resign. The Sons of Liberty sent Francis Rotch, owner of the ships Dartmouth and Beaver, to meet with Royal Governor Thomas Hutchinson to request that the ships be allowed to exit Boston Harbor without unloading the tea. (Boston Law stated that each ship had twenty days to unload its cargo and pay the duties upon it.) Hutchinson refused and the Sons of Liberty were left with no other choice. An undisclosed number of men went down to Griffin’s Wharf, in various states of disguise, and quickly boarded the three ships moored. In an organized operation, the men dumped 340 crates of East India Company Tea into Boston Harbor in a matter of three hours. It was said that thousands of Bostonians stood silently on the shore, watching the “destruction of the tea”. Over 92,000 pounds of tea were destroyed and thrown into the harbor. The men knew the gravity of their actions and no one spoke of this event for many years for fear of retribution. The first list of names connected to the “destruction of the tea” was not published until 1835.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The Sons of Liberty were quite different on the night of December 16, 1773. They had been fighting against “taxation without representation” for many years in the form of riots and intimidation. Through the influence of such men as John Hancock and John Adams, the Sons of Liberty began to operate in a more organized fashion. The “destruction of the tea” was more than just the actions of a chaotic mob; it was a calculated political protest.</span></p><p></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The implication and impact of the Boston Tea Party were enormous. After years of civil unrest, the implementation of The Coercive Acts in 1774, and the meeting of the First Continental Congress, the stage was set for conflict. The country was a tinderbox ready to ignite and the match was lit on April 19, 1775, in Lexington, MA, in what would become known as the American Revolution.</span></p><h2><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Our goal is to make December 16th a nationally recognized holiday.</span></h2><p></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We firmly believe that the Boston Tea Party was the single most important event leading up to the American Revolution.

These men willingly committed treason, punishable by death, to fight for their liberties. The “destruction of the tea” led to the creation of a new nation. We hope that through the production of the Annual Reenactment and further education of the events of December 16, 1773, this goal will become a reality.

I also need to buy a mat for me to land on. - Realistic severed body parts for an important part of my show. Thank you so much for your support of this project.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

In 2012, Rarely Pure Theatre started as a one-woman

Founder Monique Renaud had a blazing ambition to
write, direct and produce a piece. Being a mere 12 months out of theatre school
(and 3 months pregnant), Monique made a plan, set a date, and stuck to it… all
by herself.
This level of enthusiasm, dedication and passion
is what created Rarely Pure Theatre, and drew the remaining of its core

 Jane Feldberg - Actress/ Co-Founder

Friendly,
adventurous and definitely a bit of a Wild spirit! Jane was born in Latvia
(in the year of its independence - 1991) and after attending several different
drama clubs and youth theatres, including her own, where she'd put on plays and
make all her friends and family participate, Jane moved to England to study
Acting and Community Theatre at East15 Acting School. She's also a frequent visitor
of London film schools and absolutely  LOVES theatre,  currently playing Sofia in Nocturne Theatre's opening show.



Budget Breakdown:


Set -  £150

Costume -  £80
Make up (There will be clowns!) - £20 
Rehearsal Space - £ 600
Props- £50
Marketing  - £50
Wages*  - £ 2200 (4 actors x  £ 550 set fee each, for the duration of the project:  12 weeks in total)



*75% of the wages will be covered by the box office earnings and in this campaign we only require your help for the remaining 25%. (If you'd also like to support us by coming to see the show live -  That would be Amazing! )

    The Impact      There can never be enough of Good Theatre! We believe it's really important to create work that everyone involved  can be proud of and that would benefit the audience  coming to watch it. Our play is a new, company - devised piece that explores a complex relationship between two siblings and the choices they make: ''In our black comedy, Alex, a seemingly quite young man, who lives with his controlling sister Sofia, and bullied by everyone he knows, is driven to explosive violence. With a host of bizarre characters and disobedient clowns populating the world around them, and the four small walls of their flat closing in on them, Alex & Sofia may try and regain the friendship they shared in their youth, but maybe there's nothing left to gain from remembering.''Every little helps!  There's nothing like  friends to  encourage one  another in a time of need and  in our company we support each others projects and future ideas by helping them become true.  One of our core principles is to always pay our actors (and other creative members of a project - during our next productions) for their time and dedication. Unfortunately, it's too often a case of young artists having to provide their skills for free at the beginning stage of their career.

Diversity: Our company is a  mix of BA World Performance and BA Acting and Community Theatre graduates covering skills like Circus, Clown, Street Theatre, Storytelling, Puppetry, Chinese Opera, Balinese Dance, Commedia Dell'Arte, Music and many More (!!!) so get comfy and prepare to enjoy

the Unexpected and Imaginative!  ''Baby Days'' 
 This is our first project as a company and we have to learn everything ''anew'' by making decisions (and mistakes!) as we go along in order to grow, but we are also confident that by working together we can overcome obstacles and improve with every single one of them! Any help (however big or small) that you can and would be happy to provide   during this early stage  will be greatly appreciated! :)

In return we're always happy to lead a free drama based workshop of your own choice (acting, improvisation, storytelling, puppetry) as a part of the campaign so feel free to get in touch!
    Other Ways You Can Help (Please, Do!)  If at the moment You feel like giving away money is the last thing You can afford to do, that's fine, because there are many other ways You can help :)  
Come and see the Show! (it opens on 28th of February so there's plenty of time to get a ticket);

Follow us on Twitter (@NOCTheatre) where we'll be posting the latest information of other smaller campaigns related to this production (sourcing extra props, costume etc. items ''in kind'')

<div>Over the last six months, we've begun saving up to update our tech. Our goal is to create a fully modular setup by installing easy-to-move LED lights. This will help us more effectively light our shows (which are getting increasingly more ambitious and complex) and also make it so that if we have to move to a new location in the future we'll be able to take our lights with us. While we're optimistic that we'll continue to be on 7th St. &amp; Pierce for the foreseeable future, the truth is that downtown Phoenix is changing, gentrification is sweeping across the area, and should that tide sweep us up we want to be prepared and ready to land on our feet elsewhere. The problem is, with our current technology, if we have to move out, we can't take our lights with us. And a theater without lights isn't a theater.</div>

<div><b>Why This Benefits The Community:</b></div>
<div>At Space 55 we don't do just put on our own shows.

We rent out our venue to other theater groups (at a much cheaper rate than most other venues in town) and help performers who don't have their own base of operations yet have a place to put on their shows. We also regularly host events like ""7 Minutes in Heaven"" and ""9 Muses"" that gives the general public and new performers a chance to get on our stage and stretch their performing wings.</div>

<strong>Help Us Bring Quality Shakespeare Across Ontario;</strong> </h3>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Edge Productions is an independent theatre company that has been operating in Windsor, Ontario for over 7 years. We produce plays hard hitting and deeply empathetic productions in a wide variety of eras. From classical to musical and contemporary - we do it all. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">This season we are trying to bring something to communities less traveled to. We want to bring work into the juvenile detention centres and female prison systems. We believe art is inherently therapeutic, cathartic and inspiring. We believe theatre can bring hope and joy to people who may need it more than most. We believe theatre can change people for the better. </span></p>
<p>We are touring an All-Female production of William Shakespeare's Henry V. It sounds cliché and trite to say these plays can help change lives, but they have and will continue to do so for longer than any of us will be around. Shakespeare's works have been wowing audiences for centuries. Literally CENTURIES, and still do today. Shakespeare will always be current and will always be popular.</p>
<p>We are touring approximately 6-8 traditional or community based venues but we would like to bring it to inmates for free. We'd like to give points of human contact through art and give prisoners the opportunity to connect with everything Shakespeare has to offer. </p>
<h3>What makes our company special?</h3>
<p>We make quality theatre as affordable as possible so that everyone can attend.</p>
<p>We hire young, talented actors &amp; crew members. We make paying them fairly our highest priority. When we lack funds to pay, what we view as a living wage, we offer an equal profit share agreement across the board.</p>
<p>We take on students to work for us, learn from us and they enter into the same payment agreement as anyone else. </p>

<p>We are an independent theatre company. We receive no public/government funding. We need funding to grow, flourish, and continue to achieve our ambitious goals.

<li>allow us to bring this production to juvenile detention centres and female prison systems for free and allow us to provide educational drama workshops at no cost to the institutions or inmates</li>

<h3>Story</h3>
<p>My name is Laris Macario (Producer/Henry V) Henry V has been a dream role of mine for over a decade.  In my artistic life as an actor I’ve always been drawn to stories that stretch my capabilities whilst stirring the latent tempest within the audience.  I can think of no better story for the times we live in today. It’s often easy to get caught up in our own ideologies and stay in the bubbles of our making without considering whether “the other side” is doing the same.  Henry gets caught up in his own legend, as we all do, with gross disregard for the affect his actions have on the land he’s invading. Isn’t that a major part of the human story? To impose our will on others regardless of the consequences because ""we are resolute in our righteousness""?  This isn’t just a play about a war hero but a mirror into the battle between the Angels and Demons within us all and on February 19, 2019, you’ll get to find out who wins.</p>

<h3>Why <em>In Four Movements</em>?</h3>
<p>This contemporary, site specific adaptation takes Chekhov's celebrated classic and sets it in a failing bar in present day downtown Toronto.  The workers of Chekhov's estate setting are now the bartenders and staff of the bar; the writers and actors the composers and musicians who perform there. </p>
<p>Playwright and Director Meg Moran and Composer Sally Norris explore the collision of music and theatre while asking the questions that we ask ourselves as young artists: What is an artist’s relationship with their art?  Can an artist ever attain perfection?  Is it possible to separate your life from your work?  How do you measure success?  What is the personal cost of success?  How do you maintain hope amidst failure?  How do you deal with the gap between aspirations and ability?</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why $600?</h3>
<p>We are incredibly lucky to have a rehearsal and performance space provided for us, in the form of the Winchester Kitchen and Bar. There are still many other costs associated with producing a play however, and we are a group of completely unfunded, unpaid emerging artists. Your donation will help us put our actors in costume, ensure they are lit, and fund our promotional materials so that we don't have to make any more videos on a digital camera that one of us had in high school.</p>
<h3><strong>But I don't have any money...</strong></h3>
<p>Neither do we! No donation is too small. If you'd like to help out, but can't do so financially, we would love to have any expertise or in kind donations you have to offer. Video skills? Photography hobby? Crew experience? Own a print shop? Let us know how you can help us!

</div></div>","Why In Four Movements?
This contemporary, site specific adaptation takes Chekhov's celebrated classic and sets it in a failing bar in present day downtown Toronto.  The workers of Chekhov's estate setting are now the bartenders and staff of the bar; the writers and actors the composers and musicians who perform there. 
Playwright and Director Meg Moran and Composer Sally Norris explore the collision of music and theatre while asking the questions that we ask ourselves as young artists: What is an artist’s relationship with their art?  Can an artist ever attain perfection?  Is it possible to separate your life from your work?  How do you measure success?  What is the personal cost of success?  How do you maintain hope amidst failure?  How do you deal with the gap between aspirations and ability?


Why $600?
We are incredibly lucky to have a rehearsal and performance space provided for us, in the form of the Winchester Kitchen and Bar. There are still many other costs associated with producing a play however, and we are a group of completely unfunded, unpaid emerging artists. Your donation will help us put our actors in costume, ensure they are lit, and fund our promotional materials so that we don't have to make any more videos on a digital camera that one of us had in high school.
But I don't have any money...
Neither do we! No donation is too small. If you'd like to help out, but can't do so financially, we would love to have any expertise or in kind donations you have to offer. Video skills? Photography hobby? Crew experience? Own a print shop? Let us know how you can help us! Send us an email to upstart.seagull@gmail.com  
 
Upstart Theatre is proud to present The Seagull In Four Movements. March 14th-16th and 21st-23rd 2013 at the Winchester Kitchen and Bar.

<p>Hello.  </p>
<p>We are Laser Dog. 
We are everything and nothing. </p>
<p>And we are putting on a show! </p>
<p>Greg McCrary, cartoonist extraordinaire and Caitlin Hafer,
choreographer and dance film producer, are teaming up to bring Laser Dog from
the thin, 2dimensional pages of his comic book universe into the 3dimensional
stage of the our world.  Thus  the concept for <i>LASER DOG LIVE!!</i> was born.  </p>
<p><i>LASER DOG LIVE!!</i>  will combine film by Greg and animator
Rob Carwright, live dance performed by Nicholas Stettenbenz, as well as dance
film by Caitlin.  These elements
will combine, like the ingredients of an evil master mind’s grand scheme to
show the audience the futility of fighting against your own, true identity.</p>
<p>But Laser Dog and his team can’t do it all on their own. They
are trying to raise $2000, and they need your help to make <i>LASER DOG LIVE!!</i> (and their plan for world domination) come to
fruition.  </p>
<p>How will they spend the money you ask?</p>
<p>Here’s the break down: </p>
<p>$500 --&gt; Dancers’ salary</p>
<p>$400 --&gt; Animator’s salary</p>
<p>$600 --&gt; Travel expenses to unite the team in San Francisco</p>
<p>$100 --&gt; Printing post cards to draw people into their evil web </p>
<p>$150 --&gt; Costuming to protect their secret identities</p>
<p>$100 --&gt; Materials to project the film onto during the show</p>
<p>$150 --&gt; Renting studio space to perfect their tactics for world domination</p>
<p>And what do you get out of this (besides the warm, fuzzy
feeling of helping us make this show a reality)?</p>
<p>For a $10 donation you receive a copy of the show poster</p>
<p>For a $20 donation you receive your very own issue of Laser
Dog</p>
<p>For a $30 donation you receive a limited edition Laser Dog

<h2><strong>Team Statement</strong></h2>
<p>It’s been a couple of months since we got together in order to stage this great piece of writing that is “7 Days in the Life of Simon Labrosse”, a Canadian contemporary play that speaks volumes about any creative person’s nightmare:  having lots of ideas, lots of dreams and still being penniless.</p>
<p>In our enthusiastic attempt at staging this play, we have reached the point where we go into production. Here is where you nice people enter the picture: since this is a partly self-funded project, the rest of the funds need to be raised by reaching out to you all theatre enthusiasts out there.</p>
<p>From this moment on, every day brings us closer to the opening night, in this small unconventional theatre that has so kindly agreed to host us for the performances. In order to make this happen, we will need props, costumes and equipment, as well as to cover the costs of performing rights for the text. So far we have rehearsed in our own homes, with the support of our closest friends, but we need to take this to the next level.</p>
<p>We believe that if there is will, there is also a way.  Independent, fringe-like theatre is a cause worth fighting for. That’s why we need you support and why, although we have all worked in state-subsidized theatres at one point or another, we largely prefer staging this particular play in an unconventional way and place. At the end of the day, it’s all about being able to fully express ourselves, without any restrictions.</p>
<p>“7 Days in the Life of Simon Labrosse” will be a performance merging fiction and make-believe, a puzzle-like, postmodern approach on the daily life, crises and epiphanies of a self-made man. Who also happens to be in love. Part comedy, part confessional drama, the play gives out an ultimately optimistic message about being the master of our own future. Whatever it may take.</p>
<p>Opening night is scheduled for early May, 2013.</p>
<p>________________________________________________________________________</p>
<h2><strong>Cast Overview</strong></h2>
<h2> </h2>
<p><strong>Vlad Udrescu </strong></p>
<p>Has a master’s degree in acting. Has played in four of the most important theaters  and on two of the most highly regarded independent stages in Bucharest.</p>
<p>Of the most important plays he had a part in we can count Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night, a Chekhov’s Platonov.</p>
<p>He finished his studies playing Aegisthus in “The Atreus Trilogy”, a performance based on ancient Greek tragedies.</p>
<p>About his character, Simon, Vlad says:</p>
<p>“Simon is a guy who struggles through life and even though things don’t go the way he planned them, he continues to be optimistic and brave. That’s why I find Simon’s part very appealing and very easy to empathize with. It also speaks about working on your own and trying to make a living out of your own ideas. Honestly, if Simon had been an actor, he would have been a very active supporter of the independent theatre movement”. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Iolanda Covaci </strong></p>
<p>She also has a master’s degree in acting; on top of that she attended an intensive training class in New York at the famous acting school, Lee Strasberg Institute. She currently is a bachelor in Psychology.</p>
<p>As an actress she currently plays with the State Jewish Theater in Bucharest and she had parts in plays based on Strindberg’s or Matei Visniec’s  texts.</p>
<p>What Iolanda has to say about the character she’s playing:</p>
<p>“Nathalie is fascinating because she is like an iceberg:  what you see at the surface hides a much bigger universe, a colorful and conflicting inner world that requires a detective’s work to discover and reconstruct. Also, I love this part because she plays the feminine characters in the life of Simon Labrosse, parts that are very different, therefore challenging my creativity and imagination.”</p>
<p>  </p>
<p><strong>Serban Gomoi</strong></p>
<p>Just like the others, he has a master’s degree in acting and he finished his studies with the part of Malvolio in Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night.</p>
<p>After graduation he started working with four of the most important theaters in Bucharest. He acted in some of the texts of the best writers in the world: Shakespeare, Chekhov, Strindberg, Sam Shepard, and Ilf and Petrov.</p>
<p>Regarding Leo, his character, Serban (a man  of few words and plenty of action) says:</p>
<p>„This is a <em>must do</em> performance, because it’s happening between real friends and colleagues. Also, from an actor’s point of view the part of Leo is one of the hardest I’ve ever tackled. Quite challenging indeed. I think that the part of Leo speaks about the loneliness of the soul..and that’s why he has to be heard”. </p>

</ul><p>We will try to do our best with the funds that we hope to raise. Basically, this is an optimistic budget but it’s the one that we definitely need in order to stage this play in an accurate and true manner.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What We Hope For</strong></h2>
<p>Through our project, we hope to raise awareness regarding the emerging artists in Romania and support a very important scene in the cultural life of Bucharest, that of independent theatre. Furthermore, we would like to bring forward to the public some new texts and “7 Days in the Life of Simon Labrosse” is exactly the sort of text that we happily recommend.</p>

<h2><strong>Jolie's Journey</strong></h2>
<p><strong>THE TALENT</strong></p>
<p>By one proud dad,</p>
<p>Jolie was born to perform.  She has been blessed with talent and drive beyond her years. As long as I can remember she has attracted the spotlight. From the moment she was born she demanded your attention. Wherever we took her she drew people in as they adored her blond curly hair and those beautiful blue eyes and beaming smile. We knew from the moment that she was born that she was special and that the name Jolie was perfect for her. As time went by we knew that she was meant to be on a stage and to share her gifts with those fortunate to know her. </p>
<p>Jolie is the complete performer, she is beautiful, intelligent, and can sing, dance, and act. But she is more than just a triple threat because she is more than just the talent she possesses. Her drive, work ethic, and moral standards are her greatest strengths. In a world of social pressures to be a part of the ""in crowd” Jolie stands out and denies the influences that would jeopardize her values and her goals in life.</p>
<p>Jolie is just beginning to blossom and as she continues to grow and develop her talents and character there are no limits to what she can achieve. There is no denying her destiny or doubt that she was born to be in the spotlight. She is more than her name implies. </p>
<p>LVA (Las Vegas Academy of the Performing Arts &amp; International Studies) recognized her talents during her audition for their theater department and her application was accepted. Beginning in the fall Jolie will be attending LVA. We are so excited for her and the opportunity given to her. With a strong foundation and the support of family and friends, her future is bright!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE PASSION</strong></p>
<p>By Jolie Cope,</p>
<p>I began dancing at 4 years old and from the very beginning I loved to perform. From ""Boogie Oogie""(with Ms. Lilian) to today dancing on the big stage and competing with my peers, I knew this is what I was born to do. When I'm on stage I get a natural high and it gives me a rush, which drives me to work my butt off and develop my skills to become the best dancer I can be. Dancing pushes me to go the extra mile and it has given me the confidence and the drive to apply my passion in all that I do. But dancing is not my only passion, singing and acting is also a part of who I am. I wake up singing and go to bed singing, I have been fortunate to have opportunities to sing, from the National Anthem at large venues, to singing in school plays, and performing solos at choir concerts, fueling my passion for performing. As for acting I love to become a character and be funny and joke with my friends and family and to hone my craft of becoming a complete performer. I want to progress in these areas everyday. I want to push myself to the limit to become all that I know I can be. My goal is not only to be the best, but also to love what I do. This is my passion! This is what I know I'm meant to do in life. I couldn't survive without these things, they're my oxygen!</p>
<p><strong>THE CHALLENGE</strong></p>
<p>Two years ago Jolie's dance studio was merged into a larger more competitive dance studio and with it came the opportunity for her to be a part of the studio's dance competition team. While I knew Jolie had the talent and the drive to be a part of this great opportunity, I never dreamed that it would all happen so fast. Last year was her first competition and her first solo performance on a big stage, and the rest is history. She placed 1st in her category and 1st overall in the solo performances. That performance awarded her the invitation to New York and the privilege to attend master dance classes with the Rockettes, to see Broadway and all the spectacular sights of New York City, including Radio City Music Hall. Unfortunately, this opportunity comes with a hefty expense, and this is why we are reaching out to our friends and family to help Jolie get to New York and have the chance of a lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>EXPENSES: </strong></p>
<p>Your contributions will go towards the convention and travel expenses.</p>
<p><strong><em>ITINERARY:</em></strong> </p>
<p>Daily master dance classes with Broadway performers/Rockettes/professional choreographers </p>

Dancing pushes me to go the extra mile and it has given me the confidence and the drive to apply my passion in all that I do. But dancing is not my only passion, singing and acting is also a part of who I am. I wake up singing and go to bed singing, I have been fortunate to have opportunities to sing, from the National Anthem at large venues, to singing in school plays, and performing solos at choir concerts, fueling my passion for performing. As for acting I love to become a character and be funny and joke with my friends and family and to hone my craft of becoming a complete performer. I want to progress in these areas everyday. I want to push myself to the limit to become all that I know I can be. My goal is not only to be the best, but also to love what I do. This is my passion! This is what I know I'm meant to do in life. I couldn't survive without these things, they're my oxygen!
THE CHALLENGE
Two years ago Jolie's dance studio was merged into a larger more competitive dance studio and with it came the opportunity for her to be a part of the studio's dance competition team. While I knew Jolie had the talent and the drive to be a part of this great opportunity, I never dreamed that it would all happen so fast. Last year was her first competition and her first solo performance on a big stage, and the rest is history. She placed 1st in her category and 1st overall in the solo performances. That performance awarded her the invitation to New York and the privilege to attend master dance classes with the Rockettes, to see Broadway and all the spectacular sights of New York City, including Radio City Music Hall. Unfortunately, this opportunity comes with a hefty expense, and this is why we are reaching out to our friends and family to help Jolie get to New York and have the chance of a lifetime.
EXPENSES: 
Your contributions will go towards the convention and travel expenses.
ITINERARY: 
Daily master dance classes with Broadway performers/Rockettes/professional choreographers

<h3>About This Campaign</h3>
<p>After ten years in our previous home, a renovated warehouse at Penn Field, we found ourselves paying almost $150,000 a year in rent - and the rent was about to rise even more. We started looking for a place to build a permanent home for Austin Playhouse and found an ideal location at the Mueller Austin redevelopment. (<a href=""http://www.muelleraustin.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.muelleraustin.com/</a>) </p>
<p>We have been raising funds for over two years to build a new home at Mueller adjacent to the new Austin Children's Museum. We have made significant progress, raising almost $1 million in individual contributions. The project is now fully permitted and shovel ready. We expect to break ground this summer.</p>
<p>Thanks to a $25,000 matching grant from the Carolyn Rice Bartlett Charitable Foundation, <strong>all new building fund donors through June 13, 2013 will have their gifts matched up to our $25,000 goal! </strong>We're launching this campaign to reach new donors, especially those in the Austin arts community, who would like to see their impact doubled.</p>
<p>If you have the capacity and would like to donate at a higher level than those listed with this campaign, please contact us directly to hear about naming opportunities: <a href=""mailto:development@austinplayhouse.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">development@austinplayhouse.com</a>.</p>
<p>We welcome multi-year pledges too!</p>

<p>Austin Playhouse is a professional theatre company currently producing our 13th season.</p>
<p>Austin Playhouse serves as the artistic home for a core company of 27 artists under the leadership of Don Toner, Producing Artistic Director and Lara Toner, Associate Artistic Director. Our performances range from modern classics like Tom Stoppard's <em>Arcadia</em>, to local and world premieres like <em>Other Desert Cities</em> by Jon Robin Baitz and <em>Dug Up</em> by Cyndi Williams. Our 2013-2014 Season will open with the musical <em>Man of La Mancha</em>.</p>

</h3>
Over the past twenty years in Austin, Don Toner and his company have proven more than capable of building theatres. He served as project manager on the downtown State Theatre renovation when he led the State Theatre Company, bringing in the $2.9 million renovation of the historic movie theatre on time and under budget. He transformed a World War I warehouse at Penn Field into a two-theatre venue, and has made a beautiful theatre in a former storefront at Highland Mall.
<p>This time we're doing something different: creating a beautiful, functional NEW facility, built and designed from the start as a first class performance space - one that we'll own forever.</p>
<p>Our new theatre will have two stages, a 225-seat main stage and a 99-seat second stage. Both will be built with sprung floors for dance companies. The second stage will have digital projection capabilities. We'll have a rehearsal hall, classroom space, and an art gallery. We'll also have an Austin Java restaurant, children's theatre, and a rooftop terrace with views of Mueller Lake.</p>
<p>Our facility will be available for rent to other arts organizations and subsidized rent will be available for groups in need. Austin Playhouse at Mueller will be a creative hub for the greater Austin arts community.</p>

<p>In the woods of rural Connecticut, Anticline Capital, the
fastest-growing hedge fund in America, is holding its annual new-hires retreat.
Four of the nation's best and brightest are being groomed to work--and
live--the Anticline way: with total focus, radical honesty, and hearts cleansed
of the sort of emotions that might slow them down--jealousy, resentment, fear,
anger, tenderness. But between tent-pitching escapades and campfire dinners,
those emotions prove harder to eliminate than expected. Illicit affairs linger,
feelings are trampled upon, and rocks are sharpened in the dark. And Will
Merritt, an English major from Princeton suddenly in way over his head, is
faced with a choice between the woman he never should have fallen for and the
job he never should have taken. <b>THE PRIVATE SECTOR </b>is a bleak comedy about
growing up in a baffling age, of egos and minds falling apart deep in the woods.</p>

<p>@The Wild Project (7/23-8/7)</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>A turbo-charged
tragicomedy with a satirical edge, <b>LITTLE TOWN BLUES</b> takes a hard look at what
it means to be a young American in the 21st century. Drawing from
influences as wide-ranging and varied as Anton Chekhov, John Updike, and Aaron
Sorkin, the play delves into the emotional complexities of young love, intense
friendship, and the end of adolescence, while never putting aside the absurdity
of living in a world governed by iPhones, laptops, and text messaging. Navigating
through delight and devastation, the boarding students of Deforest-Martin Prep
rage against the machine of structured academia with the fire of a teenage
rebel and the depth of a Russian poet.</p>

of the sort of emotions that might slow them down--jealousy, resentment, fear,
anger, tenderness. But between tent-pitching escapades and campfire dinners,
those emotions prove harder to eliminate than expected. Illicit affairs linger,
feelings are trampled upon, and rocks are sharpened in the dark. And Will
Merritt, an English major from Princeton suddenly in way over his head, is
faced with a choice between the woman he never should have fallen for and the
job he never should have taken. THE PRIVATE SECTOR is a bleak comedy about
growing up in a baffling age, of egos and minds falling apart deep in the woods.





LITTLE TOWN
BLUES 
A modern riff on
Chekhov’s Three Sisters
By James Presson
and Rachel Buethe 
Directed by
James Presson 
@The Wild Project (7/23-8/7)

A turbo-charged
tragicomedy with a satirical edge, LITTLE TOWN BLUES takes a hard look at what
it means to be a young American in the 21st century. Drawing from
influences as wide-ranging and varied as Anton Chekhov, John Updike, and Aaron
Sorkin, the play delves into the emotional complexities of young love, intense
friendship, and the end of adolescence, while never putting aside the absurdity
of living in a world governed by iPhones, laptops, and text messaging. Navigating
through delight and devastation, the boarding students of Deforest-Martin Prep
rage against the machine of structured academia with the fire of a teenage
rebel and the depth of a Russian poet.


We Need Your Help!




We’ve got a big
season ahead of us. From the headquarters of a high-powered hedge fund to a
dorm room in Iowa, from camping gear to boarding school uniforms, and from
building campfires to sparking the embers of young love, we have many worlds to
create. Your donation would go directly towards bringing these worlds to life
right here in New York. On top of that, your donation would help support Less
Than Rent Theatre as a company as we enter our most ambitious season yet.  In our most crucial moment of
development, you can be a part of building this fresh new voice in New York
theatre.

Keep Connected!

Technology plays
a major role in both shows in our season, so we’re embracing social media!

</div></div>","Our Story
We met over six years ago at the BMI Musical Theatre Workshop, where we were paired as collaborators for one of the class assignments.  It was immediately clear that we had similar instincts and a great rapport.  Since then, we've developed a fruitful writing partnership, performed together in a number of venues and continue to expand our collaboration in various directions.


Why What We Do Is Important
We believe in our work and know it can be both commercially successful and relevant.  Our first musical, Falling to Earth, is an entertaining and moving story about people struggling to maintain identity as they are changed by relationships.  Sisco’s light-hearted comedies BAIT n’ SWISH, which we perform together, warn us about the dangers of speed dating in the funniest way possible, and analyze what happens when relationships get “comfortable.”  

We understand that it’s not just about developing our own work, but inspiring future artists.  In addition to our writing and performing, we’re now teaching seminars on the art of collaboration and coaching students on how to become singing actors.   

And this is just the beginning.  We have a long list of projects we’re just waiting to dive into once we have the resources to make them happen.  

This fundraising campaign isn’t simply about asking for financial support.  It’s about the tools we need to get our work out into the world.  We know we can make an impact once we do.


What We Need
We hope to raise $8,000 to help us defray costs associated with running our business, including: 


Hiring a professional to revamp our website to include multimedia, interviews and online sales of our songs.
Providing funds to cover the expense of negotiating the stage rights for a new musical. 
Designing marketing tools, such as joint head shots, business cards and letterhead.
Developing a nest egg for upcoming demo recordings and artists fees


Those of you who know us have shown genuine interest in our work and encouraged us to keep at it, especially when we didn’t know where it would take us.  With your generous gifts, you can help us help others discover Gualtieri & Sisco.

What You Get 
You’ll get the satisfaction of knowing you are supporting a promising writing team.  You’ll get a tax deduction (who doesn’t want that?).  And, if you donate $100 or more, you’ll get a CD of our work as a thank you.
All who donate will receive a newsletter with updates on all our projects.

</div></div>","First, a bit about Springboard:  
Founded in 2001 by Alexandra Wells (Artistic Director) and Susan Alexander (Executive Director), Springboard Danse Montréal is a non-for-profit contemporary dance organization that connects mature, experienced, professional dancers and emerging choreographers with some of today's leading international and Montreal-based and dance companies (referred to as ""Principal Companies"").  
Now in its 14th year, Springboard actively contributes to the Montreal cultural community through public installations and outreach programs. 
 

Springboard Danse Montreal is thrilled to announce our first collaboration with Place des Arts this summer. On June 18, this year's Springboard Emerging Choreographers will be showcased in a public event at l’Espace culturel Georges-Émile-Lapalme. This is an exciting opportunity for these artists to present their work in Place des Arts, one of North America's most prestigious arts venues.




Now, about the Emerging! Springboard installation by former Emerging Choreographer Danielle Russo

Springboard is committed to facilitating and showcasing the work of today's up-and-coming choreographers. Each year we offer the following unique opportunities for 7 selected artists: 


Access to high-calibre dancers


A generous amount of studio space for exploration and creation


The option of one of the following: - A 20-minute indoor installation - An outdoor installation of varying length  - A 6-minute work for the stage


The opportunity to be on the same bill as the Principal Companies 




Every year, the process culminates in a showing of works-in-progress at Usine C, Montréal's venue for avant garde dance and theatre. This showing is attended by company directors, presenters, agents, and potential producers of work. Additionally, Springboard provides each Emerging Choreographer with mentoring opportunities and the opportunity to develop a peer network of professional artists. Former mentors include Margie Gillis, Paula de Vasconcelos and Steven Cook.

Who will you be ""adopting”? The 2015 Emerging Choreographers are: 

Banning Bouldin, New Dialect (USA, Nashville)


Brendan Duggan and Mallory Lynn, LoudHoundMovement (USA, New York)

""Project L"" by 2015 Emerging Choreographer Hanna KielPhoto: Johnny VongSo, what are we asking for? Our goal is $8,000. Past Emerging Choreographers have taken residence for three weeks of creative research and composition without financial support. Our goal is to create an appropriate stipend to assist with accrued living and professional expenses. How will the money be divided?
$8000 goal:
$320 = 4% Indiegogo fee$400 = 5% Credit card and PayPal fees
$5600 = Emerging Choreographer stipends: $800 will be given to each of our 7 Emerging Choreographers to help pay for their travels and expenses accrued during the project

$1680 = The creation of an infrastructure that will be developed to sustain Emerging Choreographers in future years


""Hereafter"" by 2015 Emerging Choreographer Heather MyersPhoto: Robert Benschop

Why is the Emerging Project important? 
For the Emerging Choreographers, Springboard provides: 



A unique, collaborative environment, in which they receive feedback from dancers, peers, and mentors 


A platform for their work to seen by 500+ people, including over 100 professional dancers, producers, company directors, presenters, agents, and potential producers of work


The opportunity to work with highest-calibre artists

The development of an international network, broadening their access to potential commissions, residencies, tours and festivals
The creation of a future job market  for dancers: every year, Springboard dancers find employment with Springboard's Emerging Choreographers and their companies

<h3><strong>Why Fund Us?</strong></h3>
<p>To be completely honest, the book is already funded.</p>
<p><em>Waltzing: A Manual for Dancing and Living</em> is coming to dance floors and bookshelves soon, no matter how much we raise in this campaign.</p>
<p>The real reason we're on IndieGoGo is not to raise additional money, but to give you an opportunity to buy the book early and get your hands on it as soon as it's printed (before it's available to the general public).</p>
<p>It also gives us the chance to offer some extras, which we will be adding as the campaign progresses.</p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>Given that we're publishing the book ourselves, we're relying primarily on word of mouth to sell it.</p>
<p>That's where you can have the greatest impact, an impact for which you will forever have our gratitude (the benefits of which you'll learn about in the book).</p>
<p><em>Please help us share the joy of waltzing by telling all of your friends about the book!</em></p>

Waltzing: A Manual for Dancing and Living
A Book by Richard Powers & Nick Enge
 
What Is It?
Stanford social dance instructor Richard Powers has teamed up with Stanford social dance innovator Nick Enge to write a unique book on waltzing, combining instruction in the arts of dancing and living.
A Manual for Dancing
In Waltzing, you will learn the basic steps and the most popular variations of many different kinds of waltzing, vintage and new.
Here is a taste of the waltzes you'll learn:

Cross-Step Waltz (the newest and most innovative waltz)
Box Step Waltz (the classic American slow waltz)
Rotary Waltz (the fast, right-turning Viennese waltz)
Reverse Waltz (the fast, left turning Viennese waltz)
Redowa, Mazurka, and More!
Hambo (a dance in 3/4 that turns twice as fast as a regular waltz)
Waltz Sequence Dances and Mixers
How to Adapt Other Dances to 3/4 Time (Swing, Salsa, Tango, and more!)
How to Adapt Waltzes to 4/4 Time
As a BONUS, in addition to these waltzes in 3/4 time, you’ll also learn dances that turn and travel in other time signatures:

Polka (4/4 time)
Schottische (4/4 time)
Five-Step Waltz (5/4 time)
Seven-Step Waltz (7/4 time)
Zwiefacher (Unique Combinations of 2/4 and 3/4)
You’ll also get our tips for social dancing in general, including thoughts on:

The Three Worlds of Ballroom Dancing (Social, Competetive, and Exhibition)
Tips for Leading and Following
Tips for Developing Musicality
Notes on Style in Social Dancing
Whether you’ve never waltzed, or you’ve been dancing for decades, there’s something here for everyone.
And that's only half of it.
A Manual for Living
In addition to learning the how of waltzing, you'll also learn the why of waltzing.
You'll read about the philosophy and psychology of social dancing, and the many benefits that waltzing has in store for you, your partners, and the world at large.
Here are just a few of the topics we cover:

The Benefits of Music
The Benefits of Physical Activity
The Benefits of Touch
The Benefits of Social Relationships
The Benefits of Social Spaces
The Benefits of Trust
The Benefits of Play
The Benefits of Conditional Learning
The Benefits of Mindfulness
The Benefits of Acceptance
The Benefits of Smiling
The Benefits of Laughing
The Benefits of Giving
The Benefits of Gratitude
and much, much more!
Even if you've never considered waltzing, these topics alone are worth the cover price.
And who knows, maybe you'll be inspired to try waltzing!
Why Fund Us?
To be completely honest, the book is already funded.
Waltzing: A Manual for Dancing and Living is coming to dance floors and bookshelves soon, no matter how much we raise in this campaign.
The real reason we're on IndieGoGo is not to raise additional money, but to give you an opportunity to buy the book early and get your hands on it as soon as it's printed (before it's available to the general public).
It also gives us the chance to offer some extras, which we will be adding as the campaign progresses.
Other Ways You Can Help
Given that we're publishing the book ourselves, we're relying primarily on word of mouth to sell it.
That's where you can have the greatest impact, an impact for which you will forever have our gratitude (the benefits of which you'll learn about in the book).
Please help us share the joy of waltzing by telling all of your friends about the book!
We're on every major social network we know of:

<h3>Hi!</h3>
<p><strong>This is a campaign to raise funds so that I can get a Theatrical Publicist for my upcoming shows in 2013 because a THEATRICAL PUBLICIST can get REVIEWS which will lead me to get INVESTORS for BROADWAY.  I'd like to invite you to become a part of my DREAM. But first..let me tell you who I am..  </strong></p>
<p><strong>My name is Qurrat and in 2008, I decided to write a one woman show.</strong>  There was only one problem...I'm an actress...I wasn't a writer.  But I was, and am still, a lover of theatre.  I love plays.  I've gone to see so many plays on Broadway, Off-Broadway and off-off Broadway.  I also realized that I am in love with the form of the SOLO PLAY.  There's something so wondefully honest about one person standing before you and revealing themselves. And my ultimate goal is to be on BROADWAY! <strong>So one night, I started free writing on what I knew best: MY LIFE. </strong>I think, now, I can definitely say, I'm a writer!</p>
<p><strong>The result is a 60 minute one-woman play with 13 characters!</strong>  These characters are all based on people in my life, who either said or did something important or made me FEEL a certain way. I explored these moments by developing rich characters with monologues that delve deeper into their connection in my life.  And I learned that <strong><em>I am a writer</em> <em>because I have a story to tell.</em></strong>  When a story speaks from the heart -that is true theatre; with the ability to change the way you see others, the world, and most importantly, yourself.  <strong>My life has had its ups and downs:</strong> I was bullied, I dealt with death, I lost love.  But I have also been surrounded by wonderful family and friends.  <strong>This is the message of the piece: Through adversity, you can rise above and achieve anything!</strong>  I address the issues of family and cultural pressure, assimilation and acculturation, all within the context of becoming comfortable in your skin - and these themes are universal,   And I try to be funny as much as I can! </p>

<p>That's alot right?  The universe is telling me the time is <strong>NOW</strong>! That's why I'd like to invite you to <strong>BECOME A PART OF MY DREAM</strong>!  By contributing to my campaign, you will be helping with <strong>PUBLICITY</strong> costs.  You will be, in essence, publicizing my play and what it represents.  With the funds raised, I will be able to get a top publicist who will be able to market my show with various press outlets in every city I perform and bring audiences out to support.  If you've already seen my show, you know how important this is! </p>
</div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am trying to raise $10,000 because that will cover part of my Publicist costs.  I will have a ton of other costs relating to travel, lodging, festival fees...but this money raised will help me focus on the Performance aspects. You get perks too.  Besides being <strong>amazing</strong>, you can see what you receive with each level of contribution. Oh, you get a tax deduction too because all donations are going through my non-profit org eyeBLINK. (<a href=""http://www.eyeblink.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.eyeblink.org</a>)</p>
<p>Why do I need a publicist?  Because they have connections!  A great publicist will get press to come out to shows to review it, set up interviews and appearances...<strong>and most importantly, get the word out so that hopefully, a producing company or, rich, connected, people will help me to get to Broadway!</strong></p>
<p>I hope to reach the entire goal but any amount that is raised will be used in obtaining a great theatre publicist with connections! </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You can help even without contributing financially.  <strong>Please share this on Facebook, Twitter, through email. </strong></p>
<h3><strong>AUDIENCE REVIEWS:</strong></h3>
<p><span style="""">Alot of her themes are universal - growing up, not being accepted, making a name for yourself, trying to come out from your parents.

She kept the storyline so smooth, it was seamless. Just an outstanding performance! -Michael Geffner, NYC Producer of The Inspired Word</span></p>

<p><span style="""">I think it was really impressive that she was able to amalgamate all these different characters.

ABOUT THE SHOW
Jeremy (Jason Heymann) is having a mid-life crisis.  He’s 27.   While attending his Uncle’s wake, he  meets Austin (Brionne Davis),  a fellow mourner.  Jeremy is instantly drawn in by this handsome stranger's mysterious charm. They connect immediately, and as their conversation progresses, Jeremy discovers an uncomfortable truth:  Austin is a “wake-hopper”.  
Lukas, Jeremy’s roommate, has a wonderful and loving relationship with his partner, Frankie.  Unfortunately,  Frankie has been in a permanent vegetative state for the last two years.
Kathy, Frankie’s sister, is living the American dream:  She has a ""great"" career, a big house in the suburbs with a nice lawn and a white picket fence, two beautiful children and a husband…with whom she doesn't have sex with.  Like her brother, Kathy is realizing that her marriage is in a permanent vegetative state.
WAKING UP is a commentary on the similarities between grief and love and the consequences of what happens when those lines are blurred.

<h3>What is the musical about?</h3>
<p>""Courage is the price that life exacts for granting peace""</p>
<p>Amelia Earhart used this as the first line of a poem she wrote shortly before becoming the very first woman ever to cross the Atlantic Ocean by plane.</p>
<p>In FINAL APPROACH, we journey with Amelia as she uses her courage to live life as she chooses; to love as she chooses and to make her dreams a reality.</p>
<p>And we realize we can... we must follow her example; to rekindle and inspire in ourselves the courage to be true to ourselves and to our dreams no matter what; whether that dream is flying a plane, running a business or finding the person to spend our life with.</p>
<p>What ever dream you have - it can come true by having courage to be true to yourself - This is Amelia's legacy and the story of FINAL APPROACH.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>              ************We are just about there***********</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>I know it does not look it but thanks to some very kind offline donors, we now have almost all the money we need except for about $1500 to finish paying salaries and rent a piano for the recording.</strong></p>
<p>So now is the time we need you more than ever to lend a hand - donate whatever you can to make this dream come true - to bring all the amazingly talented people listed below together to create a new musical.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>FIANAL APPROACH PERFORMERS</strong></p>
<p>Don Richard - Two time Broadway actor to play George<br/>Lauren Braton - Amazing Triple Threat to play Amelia (check her out on youtube)<br/>Tim Noland - Former new York actor<br/>(And Claudia will be singing the role of Dorothy)<br/><br/></p>
<p><strong>FINAL APPROACH'S CREATIVE TEAM</strong></p>
<p><strong>Laurie McLaughlin: (Bookwriter)</strong> Everyone knows about Amelia Earhart. Although she disappeared in 1937, people are still fascinated by her. After spending ten years researching her life and the life of her husband George Palmer Putnam, this musical will go behind the scenes to show the truth of her life; discovering what has inspired and captivated people about her for so long.</p>
<p>When I was 6, I remember my father taking my to my first air show. I remember the power and the beauty of the planes and it was then I fell in love with aviation. Also that same year I first remember sitting in the theatre watching rehearsals for a production of <em>Oklahoma</em> my parents, uncle and aunt were in and from that moment, I was hooked on a life long love for musical theatre and my destiny was set for a career in the theatre. I spent all told 30 years in theatre (25 professionally) mostly as a stage manager, production manager and lighting designer. Through those years, I have been fortunate enough to work with Donald O'Connor, Shirley Jones and Terrence Mann and work on the workshop of <em>Heart's Desire</em> with Sergio Trujillo and be involved in the out of town pre-Broadway production of <em>Teddy And Alice</em> with Len Cariou and helped give Andrew Harrison Leeds his big break.</p>
<p><strong>Claudia Schmidt: (Composer/lyricist)</strong> Michigan native Claudia Schmidt has covered a lot of musical ground, beginning with a stirring rendition of <em>Tammy</em> at age 4 around a neighborhood bonfire. More than three decades as a touring professional have found her traversing North America as well as Europe in venues ranging from intimate clubs to to festival stages in front <br/>of 25,000 rapt listeners.</p>
<p>A musician who has always hated categories, she has recorded fourteen albums of mostly original songs, exploring folk, blues, and jazz idioms featuring her acclaimed12 string guitar and mountain dulcimer playing. She has performed on radio and TV, including regular stints on Public Radio International's <em>A Prairie Home Companion</em> in its early incarnation, and starring in an hour-long documentary called <em>I Sing Because I Can't Fly</em> produced by KTCA TV in St. Paul. She participated in Les Blank's delightful movie<em> Gap-Toothed Women</em>. She wrote the award-winning score of the Goodman Theatre's 1992 Chicago production of Brecht's<em> Good Person of Szechuan</em> and she performed along with Ruth McKenzie and Prudence Johnson in <em>The Gales of November</em>, a musical retelling of the Edmund Fitzgerald tragedy. And she just finished a new album with Sally Rogers.</p>
<p><strong>Marge Adler: (Arranger</strong>) An Ohio native, Marge is classically trained on piano and harpsichord, and former Organist for the Cleveland Indians! but is definately no stranger to the world of musical theatre. She has been musical director for over 60 professional shows as well as being the musical director for the Cleveland production of the <em>Forbidden Broadway SVU</em> national tour. Audiences and critics nationwide are raving about Marge's versatility, humor, virtuosity and her signature mix of musical styles. creating musical bridges between styles, between traditions, between old and new, sacred and secular -- all blended together to form stories to bring people together, to unite us <br/>in our human experience.<br/><br/>In 2007, Marge won the Unsigned Recording artist of the Month award from Keyboard Magazine (she was their Miss April) for her inspired CD called<em> Balm in Gilead</em>, causing Jim Brickman called it ""inventive, like nothing else out there"".</p>
<p>Marge's amazing talents have allowed her to work with such artists as Anton Coppola and David Lockington, to Broadway's Dee Hoty.</p>

</div></div>","What is the musical about?
""Courage is the price that life exacts for granting peace""
Amelia Earhart used this as the first line of a poem she wrote shortly before becoming the very first woman ever to cross the Atlantic Ocean by plane.
In FINAL APPROACH, we journey with Amelia as she uses her courage to live life as she chooses; to love as she chooses and to make her dreams a reality.
And we realize we can... we must follow her example; to rekindle and inspire in ourselves the courage to be true to ourselves and to our dreams no matter what; whether that dream is flying a plane, running a business or finding the person to spend our life with.
What ever dream you have - it can come true by having courage to be true to yourself - This is Amelia's legacy and the story of FINAL APPROACH.
 
              ************We are just about there***********
 
I know it does not look it but thanks to some very kind offline donors, we now have almost all the money we need except for about $1500 to finish paying salaries and rent a piano for the recording.
So now is the time we need you more than ever to lend a hand - donate whatever you can to make this dream come true - to bring all the amazingly talented people listed below together to create a new musical.
 
FIANAL APPROACH PERFORMERS
Don Richard - Two time Broadway actor to play GeorgeLauren Braton - Amazing Triple Threat to play Amelia (check her out on youtube)Tim Noland - Former new York actor(And Claudia will be singing the role of Dorothy)
FINAL APPROACH'S CREATIVE TEAM
Laurie McLaughlin: (Bookwriter) Everyone knows about Amelia Earhart. Although she disappeared in 1937, people are still fascinated by her. After spending ten years researching her life and the life of her husband George Palmer Putnam, this musical will go behind the scenes to show the truth of her life; discovering what has inspired and captivated people about her for so long.
When I was 6, I remember my father taking my to my first air show. I remember the power and the beauty of the planes and it was then I fell in love with aviation. Also that same year I first remember sitting in the theatre watching rehearsals for a production of Oklahoma my parents, uncle and aunt were in and from that moment, I was hooked on a life long love for musical theatre and my destiny was set for a career in the theatre. I spent all told 30 years in theatre (25 professionally) mostly as a stage manager, production manager and lighting designer. Through those years, I have been fortunate enough to work with Donald O'Connor, Shirley Jones and Terrence Mann and work on the workshop of Heart's Desire with Sergio Trujillo and be involved in the out of town pre-Broadway production of Teddy And Alice with Len Cariou and helped give Andrew Harrison Leeds his big break.
Claudia Schmidt: (Composer/lyricist) Michigan native Claudia Schmidt has covered a lot of musical ground, beginning with a stirring rendition of Tammy at age 4 around a neighborhood bonfire. More than three decades as a touring professional have found her traversing North America as well as Europe in venues ranging from intimate clubs to to festival stages in front of 25,000 rapt listeners.
A musician who has always hated categories, she has recorded fourteen albums of mostly original songs, exploring folk, blues, and jazz idioms featuring her acclaimed12 string guitar and mountain dulcimer playing. She has performed on radio and TV, including regular stints on Public Radio International's A Prairie Home Companion in its early incarnation, and starring in an hour-long documentary called I Sing Because I Can't Fly produced by KTCA TV in St. Paul. She participated in Les Blank's delightful movie Gap-Toothed Women. She wrote the award-winning score of the Goodman Theatre's 1992 Chicago production of Brecht's Good Person of Szechuan and she performed along with Ruth McKenzie and Prudence Johnson in The Gales of November, a musical retelling of the Edmund Fitzgerald tragedy. And she just finished a new album with Sally Rogers.
Marge Adler: (Arranger) An Ohio native, Marge is classically trained on piano and harpsichord, and former Organist for the Cleveland Indians! but is definately no stranger to the world of musical theatre. She has been musical director for over 60 professional shows as well as being the musical director for the Cleveland production of the Forbidden Broadway SVU national tour. Audiences and critics nationwide are raving about Marge's versatility, humor, virtuosity and her signature mix of musical styles. creating musical bridges between styles, between traditions, between old and new, sacred and secular -- all blended together to form stories to bring people together, to unite us in our human experience.In 2007, Marge won the Unsigned Recording artist of the Month award from Keyboard Magazine (she was their Miss April) for her inspired CD called Balm in Gilead, causing Jim Brickman called it ""inventive, like nothing else out there"".
Marge's amazing talents have allowed her to work with such artists as Anton Coppola and David Lockington, to Broadway's Dee Hoty.
What We Need & What You Get



So, once you donate, you will be kept up to date about the progress of the show and will see where the money you donate today will eventually lead.
And not only will your money go to getting our demo disc made which brings our (yours and ours) musical Final Approach one step closet to Broadway, but if you look to the right, you will see that because we cannot climb right through the monitor and kiss you on the lips in gratitude, you will have to settle for these very cool perks as a token of our immense thanks for making this dream a reality.
 Other Ways You Can Help
So, please share this with anyone you can think of - you don't even have to know them very well - if you think it is good enough to donate money to, others will too.


 Use this as a conversation starter with other cool people you want to get to know.
Impress your friends by telling them you are investing in a musical that might go to Broadway, and have them invest too.
 Facebook, Myspace, Tweet, start a Meetup group, blog.... go Viral on us!
 No amount is too small
 And on behalf of Claudia, Marge and myself, thanks again so much.

     Hello!  My name is Shirin June and I am in the final quarter of my MFA at CSULA!  The culmination of my time there will be my thesis project.  I have chosen to write, produce and perform an original theatrical production, E.
  I have had the opportunity to be exposed to a lot while pursuing my Masters of Fine Arts: different mediums of entertainment, different areas of creativity, and different experts and mentors in each of these areas. However, after each interaction, I was always left wanting something more. After three years at California State University, Los Angeles, I do not feel that I have left my mark on this campus or in this program. I did not want to leave with only a degree in my hand. I wanted to create a piece of art that not only showcased my talents as a matured artist but also one that spoke to and of what drives me as an actor, artist and human being.

     Joined by my best friend in life and my best friend in this program, I have been able to surround myself with people that inspire me.  Together, we will work to challenge one another and strive to bring out the best of our talents.
 
      Using the myth of Eurydice and Orpheus as well as the tragic history of Eva Braun and Adolf Hitler, I've attempted to deconstruct the question “what does it mean to love?”  Between these two ruinous stories, the audience should be able to deconstruct the effects of love on women.
 
WHAT WE NEED! WE NEED YOU!!
     Taking many things into consideration, I've written the piece to be staged in a Black Box Theater. However, that said, there are still many elements and creative ideas that we would like to explore. The play and the text are merely the canvas for our art. With your help, we can bring the words to life and leave the audience with imagery that will invoke and ignite.
 
Where Your Donation Goes

     In addition to the logistical elements that go into producing a show – posters, flyers, programs – we would like to expand the quality of the design elements. There are a few props in particular that the piece would not be complete or possible without, namely the Lyre of Orpheus. Coincidentally, this is not a prop that is readily available on a typical college campus. We have found a few instruments that would be fantastic and with your donation, we will be able to purchase this symbolic item.
 

      After attending the 42nd KC/ACTF in Ogden, Utah this past February as an Irene Ryan Nominee and having the opportunity to attend a week's worth of productions and workshops, I would like to submit the production for consideration in the 43rd Annual Festival. As a new, original production, and as an actor, I would like to have the play adjudicated by a festival respondent. The process would include a talkback following the performance as well as the opportunity to have the play, the production, the cast, and the crew nominated for numerous achievements, including the chance to remount the production for a larger, collegiate audience. Your donation would help cover the entrance fee and would get us one step closer to this goal!
 

     Logistically, we know we will be incurring a lot of fees just to keep up with good “housekeeping”. We've determined these to include dry cleaning costs for the costumes that we will be borrowing, charges for using equipment and locations for rehearsals and performances, as well as transportation. In these dire economic times, every cent helps -- especially when it comes to transportation! We will do our best to commute via the Metrolink trains as well as carpool when necessary but the distance is ever mighty!
 

      CONTINGENCY PLAN!: If I've learned only one thing from my ARTS MANAGEMENT course with Professor Paul Graham it's to always have a contingency plan!! Ten percent of our budget will be put aside for any unforeseen and emergency expenses that may come up during this process!
 
 
      Our goal is to have four performances during the weekend of May 18-20, 2012. We would be honored and pleased to have you in our audience. The cost of attendance is free as we are not working for a profit; we only wish to create good work and to establish a foundation for discourse, dialogue and discovery.

Every Help Helps!
     Any donation helps get us closer to our goal! Even if we are unable to reach $1700, all funds will be put to the best of use to create a memorable and meaningful project. If you would like to personally donate your contribution, we would be more than happy and humbled to meet with you.

Other Ways You Can Help
     Please consider donating ONE SECOND of your time! It's as simple as “sharing” our IndieGoGo link, “liking” our show's page, and of course, attending a performance! We would love to hear what you have to say! The project doesn't end with the performances! I am working on the companion thesis research paper and your feedback and response would be invaluable to this process!

<p><strong>Bringing Terry Quinn's <em>Bad Evidence </em>to Los Angeles for the West Coast Premiere six week Stage Production to open November 2012. </strong></p>
<p><strong>I have laid it all out in massive detail below. Feel free to scan, glance, peruse, take in all in one sitting or come back for more. <br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Update Aug. 21, 2012- I will be dedicating my performance to Tony Scott. A man I worked for, knew and loved. Sadly,  I never got to watch him direct and he never saw me act but I know he would love the passion, sex, drugs &amp; profanity in this show. Sorry TS no guns, fast cars, trains, planes, cigars etc. but hopefully we will bring some rock n roll too!<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Bad Evidence - </em></strong>A drama in two acts</p>
<p>A faltering marriage compels a husband and wife to make a pact – they will disclose searing truths in the heat of passion. The exposure leads to a confrontation with four of their friends, and deeper revelations.</p>
<p><strong>Backstory:</strong></p>
<p><em>Bad Evidence</em> is a play that struck me instantaneously when I read it in April 2011.</p>
<p>Have you ever had that happen? You watch a movie, tv show, read a book, hear a song, look at a painting and are just stabbed in the heart and not even because you overtly relate or have had that exact experience or even understand what you are seeing, hearing, feeling but you just know that you are deeply connected to this piece. That's what happened to me with <em>Bad Evidence.</em></p>
<p>If I had just one goal with this project it would be to get as many people as possible to experience this play so that maybe just maybe one person will be as affected as I was when I read it for the first time.</p>
<p><strong>Now: </strong></p>
<p>So how did I get from deeply connected in NYC to co-producing/starring in the West Coast Premiere in LA?  </p>
<p>The short version or rather the shorter version: I auditioned for the World Premiere at The Cell Theatre in NYC last spring, got a call back which was the best call back experience I have ever had for anything, went to see the show out of love for the play even though I didn't get the part, ran into the playwright, kept in touch with him and then 4 months later with no new creative projects pending I got this wild voice  in my head that wouldn't leave me saying<span style=""color: black; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: small;""> </span><em>DO BAD EVIDENCE! PRODUCE IT.  ACT IN THE ROLE YOU LOVED. SHARE THIS BOLD PLAY WITH THE WORLD!</em> OK? But how?  <em>GET THE RIGHTS. DO IT IN LA. YOU KNOW SO MUCH TALENT THERE AND THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME REASON YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO LET GO OF YOUR HOLLYWOOD APARTMENT AFTER TWO YEARS IN NY, NOT TO MENTION YOUR CAR?</em> Terrified and thrilled, at the start of the New Year, I thought of the old quote from Risky Business ""Every now and then say, 'What the fuck.' 'What the fuck' gives you freedom. Freedom brings opportunity. Opportunity makes your future. "" So I went for it and emailed the playwright requesting  the rights to a West Coast Premiere production.  I got a resounding yes and the project was pregnant and on it's way...So now 7 months later, unlike a baby that will be born whether you have the money or not this baby needs more than a helping hand and lots of pushing but a healthy dose of cash.</p>
<p>So please help me give birth to this beautiful child of love. Thanks in advance for your support.</p>
<p><strong>How much is this show gonna cost? </strong></p>
<p>Our Budget is at $28,500 though my producer would be happier if we had over $30,000. </p>
<p> <strong>""But Glory it's 99 seat waiver theatre in LA, why do you need so much money?""</strong></p>
<p>It's 99 seat theatre not 99 cent theatre. I have produced a show for under a grand and also one for under five grand but no one was being paid and you get what you pay for- in stress if nothing else. With this project my desire is to offer a professional experience of talent, love, respect and commitment. To offer respect means to value people I am working with and pay them something for their talent, not expect it for free just because one can, in Los Angeles land of dreams and mirages as well as miracles and surprises.</p>
<p><strong>""I'm confused why are you asking for 12.5K when the budget is 28.5K?""</strong></p>
<p>I crunched the numbers and 12.5K is double the number I thought I could achieve here, and one that scares me and pushes my edge. It's also just enough to get the show started.</p>
<p>I am using 5K from my own hard earnings... will probably be getting the rest through  blood, sweat, tears and more sweat. It's very hot and humid in New York and I cook for a living so...sweat is plentiful.</p>
<p>There will also be a few fundraising events such as a spinning class taught at a top studio in Los Angeles - TBA. Check back for info or I will stalk you with it : )</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>""But you still haven't said where the money is going?""</strong>  Hold your horses! It's going oh so many places, none of which are my new shoe budget despite the fact that New York Kills Espadrilles and other flat shoes and I am seriously in need of new footwear.</p>
<p><strong>Theatre Rental</strong>- This is a lot folks and in looking it hasn't even gone up much since the first show I produced in 1998 which is sad for theatre but good for us since even then it was pricey.</p>
<p><strong>Producer's Fee</strong>- This is professional theatre or theater if you prefer and it's hard to produce a show alone from New York after you've been away for two years and oh are also starring in the show and raising the money.</p>
<p><strong>Director's Fee</strong>- See above where I said you get what you pay for and I am offering a professional experience. Enough said. </p>
<p><strong>Actors' Fees</strong>- Actors who get paid show up and feel respected. I am not doing community theatre in Saugatuck, Michigan. Though it's a beautiful city and you should go to the film festival there next summer: <a href=""http://www.waterfrontfilm.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.waterfrontfilm.org</a></p>

<p> <strong>*</strong>*If  the entire goal is not reached all funds will go to my director, my producer and I going on a ski trip to Mammoth. Just kidding but you are welcome to contribute separately to my travel fund. This play is happening whether I reach the goal or not. I would just prefer to avoid extreme credit card debt and tax evasion so help me do this the sane way.</p>
<p><strong> Other Ways You Can Support the Project</strong></p>
<p>First off no amount of money is too little. If I could find 1000 people to give me $2.50; I would be 20 percent there. But if you can't give money and still want to show support all I ask is that you share the news via twitter, facebook, googleplus, OKCupid, Match.com, your blog, your church, your acting class, your yoga class, your bank, your instagram etc. Rise and Shine and Give God your Glory Glory or just share your Glory Glory or my Glory Glory.  Here's the link to share: <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/badevidencela"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.indiegogo.com/badevidencela</a></p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Perks/Rewards: </strong></p>
<p>It was suggested by a close female friend that I offer a photo shoot with my boobs but apparently that falls under pornography and sexually explicit material so alas that will not be a perk.  But I do have some tasty delights to offer you to your right.</p>
<p>Why do you want me to cook for you and what is Sweet Glory?  I am a trained culinary professional, currently working as a personal chef in NYC and one that will allow you make substitutions and have complicated dietary restrictions and cook for you with love and care.  I have references to boot. You can see photos above and in the gallery. Sweet Glory is the name for my upcoming line of cookies that will have both decadent and dietary restriction friendly choices. </p>

<p><strong>Review Exerpts from the World Premiere of <em>Bad Evidence</em> at The Cell Theatre in NYC: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Review from Fix.com</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong><em>Bad Evidence</em> keeps its realistic tone with partial nudity, language and topics that aren’t afraid to push the envelope... The power and the intensity of the dialogue keep the audience hanging on every word as deep dark secrets are revealed...</p>
<p>Audiences will love <em>Bad Evidence </em>because it’s so relatable and realistic. Anyone who has been in a relationship, or is married will understand the volatile yet loving relationship Leah and Richard have and root for them to work it out.</p>

What seems like very evolved behavior quickly deteriorates into psychological warfare, and the tension in the theater was palpable.<br/><br/> It’s sort of like a modern-day Whose Afraid of Virginia Wolff, but instead of wanting to off yourself in the end, there is a shimmer of hope that resonates in the last line and leaves you wondering about the fate of these somewhat tortured but very much alive people.</p>
<p> </p></div>","ABOUT THIS PROJECT: 
Bringing Terry Quinn's Bad Evidence to Los Angeles for the West Coast Premiere six week Stage Production to open November 2012. 
I have laid it all out in massive detail below. Feel free to scan, glance, peruse, take in all in one sitting or come back for more. 
Update Aug. 21, 2012- I will be dedicating my performance to Tony Scott. A man I worked for, knew and loved. Sadly,  I never got to watch him direct and he never saw me act but I know he would love the passion, sex, drugs & profanity in this show. Sorry TS no guns, fast cars, trains, planes, cigars etc. but hopefully we will bring some rock n roll too!
Bad Evidence - A drama in two acts
A faltering marriage compels a husband and wife to make a pact – they will disclose searing truths in the heat of passion. The exposure leads to a confrontation with four of their friends, and deeper revelations.
Backstory:
Bad Evidence is a play that struck me instantaneously when I read it in April 2011.
Have you ever had that happen? You watch a movie, tv show, read a book, hear a song, look at a painting and are just stabbed in the heart and not even because you overtly relate or have had that exact experience or even understand what you are seeing, hearing, feeling but you just know that you are deeply connected to this piece. That's what happened to me with Bad Evidence.
If I had just one goal with this project it would be to get as many people as possible to experience this play so that maybe just maybe one person will be as affected as I was when I read it for the first time.
Now: 
So how did I get from deeply connected in NYC to co-producing/starring in the West Coast Premiere in LA?  
The short version or rather the shorter version: I auditioned for the World Premiere at The Cell Theatre in NYC last spring, got a call back which was the best call back experience I have ever had for anything, went to see the show out of love for the play even though I didn't get the part, ran into the playwright, kept in touch with him and then 4 months later with no new creative projects pending I got this wild voice  in my head that wouldn't leave me saying DO BAD EVIDENCE! PRODUCE IT.  ACT IN THE ROLE YOU LOVED. SHARE THIS BOLD PLAY WITH THE WORLD! OK? But how?  GET THE RIGHTS. DO IT IN LA. YOU KNOW SO MUCH TALENT THERE AND THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME REASON YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO LET GO OF YOUR HOLLYWOOD APARTMENT AFTER TWO YEARS IN NY, NOT TO MENTION YOUR CAR? Terrified and thrilled, at the start of the New Year, I thought of the old quote from Risky Business ""Every now and then say, 'What the fuck.' 'What the fuck' gives you freedom. Freedom brings opportunity. Opportunity makes your future. "" So I went for it and emailed the playwright requesting  the rights to a West Coast Premiere production.  I got a resounding yes and the project was pregnant and on it's way...So now 7 months later, unlike a baby that will be born whether you have the money or not this baby needs more than a helping hand and lots of pushing but a healthy dose of cash.
So please help me give birth to this beautiful child of love. Thanks in advance for your support.
How much is this show gonna cost? 
Our Budget is at $28,500 though my producer would be happier if we had over $30,000. 
 ""But Glory it's 99 seat waiver theatre in LA, why do you need so much money?""
It's 99 seat theatre not 99 cent theatre. I have produced a show for under a grand and also one for under five grand but no one was being paid and you get what you pay for- in stress if nothing else. With this project my desire is to offer a professional experience of talent, love, respect and commitment. To offer respect means to value people I am working with and pay them something for their talent, not expect it for free just because one can, in Los Angeles land of dreams and mirages as well as miracles and surprises.
""I'm confused why are you asking for 12.5K when the budget is 28.5K?""
I crunched the numbers and 12.5K is double the number I thought I could achieve here, and one that scares me and pushes my edge. It's also just enough to get the show started.
I am using 5K from my own hard earnings... will probably be getting the rest through  blood, sweat, tears and more sweat. It's very hot and humid in New York and I cook for a living so...sweat is plentiful.
There will also be a few fundraising events such as a spinning class taught at a top studio in Los Angeles - TBA. Check back for info or I will stalk you with it : )
 
""But you still haven't said where the money is going?""  Hold your horses! It's going oh so many places, none of which are my new shoe budget despite the fact that New York Kills Espadrilles and other flat shoes and I am seriously in need of new footwear.
Theatre Rental- This is a lot folks and in looking it hasn't even gone up much since the first show I produced in 1998 which is sad for theatre but good for us since even then it was pricey.
Producer's Fee- This is professional theatre or theater if you prefer and it's hard to produce a show alone from New York after you've been away for two years and oh are also starring in the show and raising the money.
Director's Fee- See above where I said you get what you pay for and I am offering a professional experience. Enough said. 
Actors' Fees- Actors who get paid show up and feel respected. I am not doing community theatre in Saugatuck, Michigan. Though it's a beautiful city and you should go to the film festival there next summer: http://www.waterfrontfilm.org
Full Budget List:
Producer, Director,Playwright, Actors, Stage Manager,                                              Set Designer, Lighting Designer, Sound Designer, Costume Designer, Press Photographer, Graphic Designer, Theatre Rental, Rehearsal /Audition Space Rental, Liability Insurance,  Light/Sound Rentals, Set materials, Costume materials, Props/misc, Postcards Printing & Distribution, Programs Banner/signage at theatre, Pre-show/show advertising, LA Stage Alliance, Opening night gala, Box office , Concessions
*If you want hard numbers, email me. I don't want to advertise the rates of those working for me as it can affect the rates they are paid for future work, but am happy to share that information privately with donors upon request and with permission of those working for me.  
 **If  the entire goal is not reached all funds will go to my director, my producer and I going on a ski trip to Mammoth. Just kidding but you are welcome to contribute separately to my travel fund. This play is happening whether I reach the goal or not. I would just prefer to avoid extreme credit card debt and tax evasion so help me do this the sane way.
 Other Ways You Can Support the Project
First off no amount of money is too little. If I could find 1000 people to give me $2.50; I would be 20 percent there. But if you can't give money and still want to show support all I ask is that you share the news via twitter, facebook, googleplus, OKCupid, Match.com, your blog, your church, your acting class, your yoga class, your bank, your instagram etc. Rise and Shine and Give God your Glory Glory or just share your Glory Glory or my Glory Glory.  Here's the link to share: https://www.indiegogo.com/badevidencela
 
TOP TEN REASONS TO CONTRIBUTE TO BAD EVIDENCE
10. You love me- (which means you don't want the IRS and Credit Card companies chasing me. You would prefer I live a happy joyous and debt- free actress, producer, chef  life: )

9. You love theatre that involves challenged interpersonal relationships and sex.  Yes, I said Sex and yes I meant challenged sex.

8.You wish you could say you made more charitable donations than money that goes to your ex-wife or your bartender if you live in New York or to your trainer or your life coach in Los Angeles. 
 
7. You hate to cook and shop and fear walking into bakeries but love home cooked meals and fresh baked cookies. 
 
No, I did not steal these photos. They are all my creations and there are more in the gallery!
 6. You like to see people achieve their dreams and get to be a part of that. Aw yes, I mean that you too can make a difference.

 5. Starbucks has enough money. 

 * Ramona does not support or oppose Starbucks nor is she a reason to donate. She's just cute and meant to subliminally stimulate empathy, vulnerability, generosity and kindness
 4. Did I say Cookies? MMMN Cookies.... Yum. I will even make them gluten free, vegan and sans sugar if you wish.

3.  You are not a douchebag and I love you. Oh well that's kind of two reasons but they go together. I also love Duck Bacon which has little relevance here.
 
 2. You've always wanted to say you were a producer (Or you want to finally say it and be able to prove it.)
1. You will get a boobie hug.  No, I won't hug your boobs but if I hug you it will be boobilicious and who doesn't love a boobie hug? (It's ok Dad this doesn't apply to you. Sherri cover his eyes.)
 
*If you would like to share better reasons I am happy to amend and post this top ten list on updates cause I am that kind of gal and I finally figured out how to upload photos into this gosh darn thing!
 
Perks/Rewards: 
It was suggested by a close female friend that I offer a photo shoot with my boobs but apparently that falls under pornography and sexually explicit material so alas that will not be a perk.  But I do have some tasty delights to offer you to your right.
Why do you want me to cook for you and what is Sweet Glory?  I am a trained culinary professional, currently working as a personal chef in NYC and one that will allow you make substitutions and have complicated dietary restrictions and cook for you with love and care.  I have references to boot. You can see photos above and in the gallery. Sweet Glory is the name for my upcoming line of cookies that will have both decadent and dietary restriction friendly choices.

<h3>The Edinburgh Festival Fringe 2013</h3>
<p>The Max Bell Theatre Company is currently preparing to mount <em>The Gypsybird Speaks</em>, an original play by Derek Mitchell at the 2013 Festival Fringe in Edinburgh, Scotland. We're currently in the first phase of our fundraising, and we need your help to make it happen!</p>
<h3>The Company</h3>
<p>The Max Bell Theatre Company is composed mostly of theatre artists who met at Lester B. Pearson UWC in Victoria, British Columbia. Following the successful mounting of <em>The</em> <em>Gypsybird Speaks </em>in the spring of 2012, some of those involved have moved to perform the show in Edinburgh this summer, under the creative direction of Derek Mitchell. With the incorporation of producers Lauren Howe and Kaśka Nowacka, as well as several crewmembers and technicians from Edinburgh universities, the company has grown and transformed to meet the needs of this unique production.</p>

<div>
<h3>Where This Money Will Go</h3>
<p>The Max Bell Theatre Company is alread contracted at C Venues, a large venue popular at the Edinburgh Fringe. The funds raised from this campaign will first go to fulfill guaranteed installments insuring our space at the venue, but they'll also cover additional production costs, as well as the expense of housing international cast and crewmembers through the months of July and August. This campaign will not cover all of our production costs; we'll also rely on arts-oriented grants and corporate sponsorships to fund our show. Here is our working provisional budget:</p>
<ul>
<li>Venue Hire (66%) - $10,100</li>
<li>Housing (Int'l Cast &amp; Crew) - $2,500</li>
<li>Food &amp; Drink - $2,500</li>
<li>Transportation (Van Rental) - $1,000</li>
<li>Costumes - $300</li>
<li>Props &amp; Puppets - $500</li>
<li>Marketing &amp; Publicity - $1000</li>
<li>Music Licensing Fees - $100</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Show</h3>
<p><em>The Gypsybird </em><em>Speaks </em>is an exploration of an outlandish group of characters whose immediate disparity is gradually softened, so that the bonds between each coalesce and blur narrative lines. The preliminary action takes place as a dialogue in a forest clearing; as a writer, a painter, a director and a witch banter and recall a young woman named Philena, a fictionalized reimagining of real-life 'gypsy moths' ravages the forest about the clearing. Across three acts, the dialogue becomes action compelled by unreliable narration, and the operation of puppets who act as mirrors for some of the distorted characters.</p>
<p>The narrative questions loneliness in the face of catastrophe, the fineness of hope, and the means by which we choose to escape.</p>
</div>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<b>An Evening of Happenings</b><br/><p>Sparrow Dance Productions is excited to announce its first full-length production, <i>An Evening of Happenings</i>, on September 27th! Sparrow has been a growing contemporary dance company in Albuquerque, New Mexico that has been making small impacts on the community through its freelance work and guest appearances in various venues. However, as a company, Sparrow has never had its own show solely dedicated to its dancers and its own choreography. For the first time ever, audiences will truly get to see the depth and range of the Sparrow company in a jazz-blues themed two-part evening, featuring choreography by Christina Daly and Devon Adams. The performance will take place at the Wheel Museum in Downtown Albuquerque September 27, 2015. <br/></p>
<b>The Company</b><br/><p>Sparrow Dance Productions is a multifaceted contemporary dance company based in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The company was originally founded in New York City in 2010 by director and choreographer Christina Daly. Since then, the company has moved to Albuquerque and has continued to grow artistically. Sparrow productions and the dancers of Sparrow demonstrate versatility and adaptability that the company prides itself on. Freelance venue-specific projects have allowed Sparrow to rehearse and perform in a wide and exciting variety of venues, such as the bank of the Rio Grande River, Zendo Coffee, The African American Performing Arts Center, consecutive years with Santa Fe Fashion Week, and TEDXABQ. <br/></p>
<p>Even though Sparrow Dance Productions is becoming a recognized name in the Albuquerque area, it's time for Sparrow to become a full-fledged company and produce a performance entirely devoted to Sparrow. <br/></p>
<p><b>Your Support</b><br/>With your contributions and support, Sparrow Dance Productions can finally reach its goal of creating its own full-length show. The choreography is already in motion, the production is in development, and now we just need the funds to actually put on An Evening of Happenings. The funds will go towards the venue rental of the Wheel Museum, costumes, the purchase of lighting and prop elements, and dancer and choreographer salaries. We can make this entire production happen for $5,000; now we just need your help to raise it!</p>
<p>In order for Sparrow to afford these production costs, we're relying on 
your generous donations to help Sparrow soar. Every dollar helps, and 
the directing team, dancers, and audience members thank you from the 
bottom of our hearts. <br/></p>
<p>Every individual who donates any amount to our fundraiser will receive a shout out of the company's love and gratitude on all forms of Sparrow Dance Productions social media. Additional perks for increasing donation amounts include coupons for $5/off tickets, mentions in the program, free tickets to An Evening of Happenings, and an autographed photo of the company.<br/></p>
<p><b>The Impact</b><br/>This dream of creating a full-length production is finally becoming a reality, and we need your help and support for Sparrow Dance Productions to grow into a full-fledged dance company. We are so excited to reveal the possibilities of Sparrow in this jazz-blues-themed evening of dance, and hope you can make it to Sparrow Dance Productions' first full-length performance!<br/></p>

Even though Sparrow Dance Productions is becoming a recognized name in the Albuquerque area, it's time for Sparrow to become a full-fledged company and produce a performance entirely devoted to Sparrow. 
Your SupportWith your contributions and support, Sparrow Dance Productions can finally reach its goal of creating its own full-length show. The choreography is already in motion, the production is in development, and now we just need the funds to actually put on An Evening of Happenings. The funds will go towards the venue rental of the Wheel Museum, costumes, the purchase of lighting and prop elements, and dancer and choreographer salaries. We can make this entire production happen for $5,000; now we just need your help to raise it!
In order for Sparrow to afford these production costs, we're relying on 
your generous donations to help Sparrow soar. Every dollar helps, and 
the directing team, dancers, and audience members thank you from the 
bottom of our hearts. 
Every individual who donates any amount to our fundraiser will receive a shout out of the company's love and gratitude on all forms of Sparrow Dance Productions social media. Additional perks for increasing donation amounts include coupons for $5/off tickets, mentions in the program, free tickets to An Evening of Happenings, and an autographed photo of the company.
The ImpactThis dream of creating a full-length production is finally becoming a reality, and we need your help and support for Sparrow Dance Productions to grow into a full-fledged dance company. We are so excited to reveal the possibilities of Sparrow in this jazz-blues-themed evening of dance, and hope you can make it to Sparrow Dance Productions' first full-length performance!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Detroit Theatre Collective is now fundraising for a full-length theatre event, made up of three short plays by the great Swedish playwright, novelist and painter August Strindberg.We are a small group of actors and directors originally from the Detroit area.  We've also studied, lived and worked in other cities but at some point have returned to metro Detroit in order to make a creative nest.  We are always looking for something bigger and more enticing in the theatre ... something that demonstrates why we were pulled into this world in the first place.  These plays do just that.By helping us with a donation, you will put into motion a project that has been years in development.  You can make this process move!But first, a bit about the inspiration ... lithograph by Edvard Munch, 1896Born in 1849, JOHAN AUGUST STRINDBERG was a pioneer of both realism and dreamlike super-realism in the theatre. Often branded a misogynist, he was deeply troubled by the gender roles and taboos of his time. Surprisingly, he supported women's equality in ways such as having the vote and equal opportunity in education. He struggled with mental stability much of his life. This reached a climax during an infamous 'Inferno' period, when he experimented with the occult techniques of Franz Mesmer and Emmanuel Swedenborg (dabbling in hypnosis, psychic phenomena and alchemy - yes, he tried to make gold). He was deeply intrigued by the workings of the Unconscious Mind.The Town, painting by Strindberg 1903So, Why Now?Just after the 100th anniversary of his death, it is a fantastic time to rediscover this genius!  But milestones aside, why now, and why in Detroit?Strindberg's great influence on American drama is well documented.  Eugene O' Neill gushed about him during much of his Nobel Prize speech in 1936: ""For me, he remains . . . the Master, still to this day more modern than any of us, still our leader."" ""They call it love-hatred, and it hails from the pit"" ... This Strindberg quote was found written in the back of one of Tennessee Williams school books as a young man, and one could say that such a vision of sexual torment is the driving force of his plays.In other words, we would like to travel back to where it all started  ... with the intent of bringing Strindberg's theatrical vision to life.  We will also resurrect these plays anew, calling on our collective experience and the visual culture of the last 100 years.Our NeedsThe $4,000 we are raising will put this project into production - by reserving a performance venue in Detroit and allowing a budget to be created.  We are committed to making a streamlined theatre event without excess. However, certain foundations must be provided for such as:

theater rental

rehearsal space
advertising
a quality production team

equipment costs

For a donation of $20.00 or more, you will receive ticket(s) to be used any time during the run of the show, as well as a thankful mention ... so you are really just purchasing your tickets in advance.  Any amount you're able to give is greatly appreciated!You have our promise that your donation will go 100% toward creating a remarkable piece of theatre.  You will be helping a dream to be realized.Our goal is to mount this production in the city of Detroit by Fall of 2014.  We will move into production as soon as we are financially able to do so.The ProcessTHE BIG GRAVEL SIFTER                  THE STRONGER                                     PLAYING WITH FIREThree directors and an ensemble cast will join forces to mold these plays into a unified performance piece.

<p> Hi, my name is Alexander Paris and I'm a playwright living in Brooklyn, NY. I'm a Virgo with a Cancer stellium in my moon, venus, and mars. (which in short, means I'm super emotional.) Cancer Cancer Cancer is my brand new play which is also my first ever full length production. We've assembled a super talented and amazing group of people to put this show up for ANT Fest at Ars Nova (511 W 54th St, NY) on June 25th at 7pm. </p>
<p><font>Our Crew</font>: Written by Alexander Paris. Directed by Michael Leibenluft. Produced by Bailey Williams. Stage Managed by Krista Jarboe. Sound Design by Peter Mills Weiss. Lighting Design by Kate McGee. Scenic Design by Joo Kim.</p>
<p>Our Cast: Jamar Williams*, Gregory Georges, Issa Best, Starr Busby, Liba Vaynberg*, and Patrick Reilly*</p>
<p>ANT Fest is Ars Nova's annual, month-long celebration of All New Talent, when New York City's premier hub for emerging artists throws open its door to a wide variety of artists to present dozens of cutting edge music, theater, and comedy shows, with a focus on blurring the boundaries between them. Out of hundreds of projects submitted, Ars Nova has selected 28 shows (INCLUDING THIS ONE!) for a jam-packed month filled with New York's most exciting emerging talent! Over the last ten years, ANT Fest has become known throughout the industry as a key stop to discover new talent, and several recent Off-Broadway productions including Underground Railroad Game, The Woodsman and Eager to Lose were all born out of ANT Fest productions. Being a part of ANT Fest is a SUPER BIG DEAL and we want to create the best show possible while being able to honor the great contribution that our performers and team members put into making this show. </p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
</div><div><ul>
<li>We need $4500 for this show! Over 60% of the funds will go towards ensuring that all actors are paid for their time, and that all team members (our various designers, stage manager, producer, director, and the playwright) will get compensated for the hours they poured into this production. The rest of the money will go towards the design of the show and its posterity (a nice video recording and photography of the performance), as well as incidentals like transportation, script printing, etc.</li>
<li>We don't have super crazy perks because we are trying to operate at minimum overhead, but we want to make sure you are thanked for your contribution! I'm a pretty decent visual artist along with being a playwright, and I'll be happy to draw your pretty faces, post them on social media, and send them to you. I also believe that it's important for this work to be seen by those who can't be present for our single evening of presentation, so a $100 contribution will get you a digital copy of the show once it's been edited nicely by our videographer.</li>
<li>If we don't reach our goal for funds, the money we made will be divided among all team members who worked on the production.</li>
</ul></div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>I could not imagine that a play I've worked on could get this sort of traction and attention this early on in my career. I'm truly humbled to be a part of Ars Nova's All New Talent Festival, and I want to make this production as good as it can be.</li>
<li>Supporting this production ensures that it will get up on its feet and be seen by a lot of people, some of which may be deeply affected by it personally, some which will want to provide more opportunities for the actors involved, and some which may have interest in giving the production a longer life somewhere else.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul><li>Producing a show is nearly always a risk, but we have plans in place for our worst case scenarios. There is a contingency fund built into the budget and it is our highest priority that money goes first to personnel, then to design. The show will happen no matter what, and I have an experienced and dedicated team behind me to help it along the way. </li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<ul><li>If you can't afford to support this show financially, that's totally okay! I understand and have been there too (in fact I'm still there.) But if you still want to support it, feel free to spread the word about it! Let people know it's happening by sharing this campaign or info about the show via Facebook, Instagram, or here on Indiegogo.</li></ul>
<p>Overall, this play is my first big venture into theater! It's the first time I've presented a full length and the first time that I have worked with this many people on a production. I want to honor them for their time and commitment to me and this production, and we want to honor you by making it the best show possible for its first time on its feet.</p>

<p>Per celebrare il <strong>700esimo anniversario</strong> della morte del sommo poeta abbiamo dato vita a <a href=""http://www.itinerdante.it"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">«ItinerDante - Italian Street Tour»</a>, un’iniziativa che porterà i canti dell’Inferno dantesco in performance itineranti per le regioni italiane. Scopo del progetto è quello di coinvolgere il maggior numero di persone possibili per riscoprire, insieme, i fondamenti della nostra cultura. Per farlo, <strong>attraverseremo l’Italia</strong> in un percorso lungo <strong>700 km</strong> che coinvolgerà <strong>città, piccoli comuni, località turistiche e «luoghi danteschi».</strong> Sarà un modo per celebrare i tesori del Bel Paese con la più importante opera letteraria di tutti i tempi, ma anche un’occasione per riflettere, collettivamente, sulla nostra umanità al tempo del Covid.</p>
<p><br/>Attraverso la declamazione dei canti danteschi in versione originale e in italiano attuale, le nostre performance di piazza consentono, infatti, di riscoprire tutta l’attualità della Divina Commedia che, parlando dei vizi e delle aree oscure dell’animo umano, parla di tutti noi e della società di oggi, sollecitandoci a ripensare le nostre vite per tornare, tutti insieme dopo la pandemia, “<strong>a riveder le stelle</strong>”.<br/> </p>

<p>Lo <strong>Street Tour di ItinerDante</strong> ha raccolto l'interesse di numerose realtà culturali nazionali e ottenuto il patrocinio dell'<strong>Associazione Italianisti - Gruppo Dante</strong>, la <strong>Società Dante Alighieri</strong>, dell'<strong>Hypermedia Dante Network</strong> e dell'<strong>ENAC</strong> (Ente Nazionale Attività Culturali).<br/><strong>Hanno già parlato di noi (tra l’altro):</strong></p>

<div><h2>Perché sostenerci</h2></div>
<p>Per darci una mano a portare i canti di Dante e le riflessioni che esse sollecitano nel maggior numero di piazze italiane. <strong>Più persone potremo coinvolgere</strong>, più emozioni riusciremo a generare, <strong>più grande sarà il contributo che riusciremo a dare</strong> (nel nostro piccolo) alla ripresa culturale del nostro Paese dopo i mesi bui della pandemia. <strong>Il progetto non ha fini di lucro</strong> e il viaggio (700 chilometri in 7 regioni italiane) sarà per noi impegnativo in tutti i sensi. Col il tuo aiuto puoi <strong>aggiungere “benzina”</strong> al progetto e allungare il nostro percorso per l’Italia. Noi ci impegniamo a viaggiare finché avremo benzina. Nel momento in cui finirà torneremo a casa.  <br/> </p>

<h2>Cosa ti offriamo</h2>
<p>Abbiamo pensato a dei regali-premi di ringraziamento personalizzati. Si parte da una foto digitale autografata, passiamo alla locandina dell'evento e si arriva fino a una traccia audio con uno spezzone di Canto della Divina a tua scelta e con dedica personalizzata.<br/>Insomma, mica pizza e fichi. </p>

<p>Grazie al tuo supporto, <strong>saremo in grado di continuare il tour verso nuove mete</strong>, allacciarci la cintura, mettere in moto e partire alla conquista di città, capoluoghi e regioni! </p>
<p>La lunghezza del nostro percorso è nella nostra volontà di non arrenderci, nei chilometri di strade asfaltate (e non) che percorreremo, nelle vie assolate in cui reciteremo e nelle tue mani che ci aiuteranno a camminare più lontano. <br/> </p>

<h2> </h2>
<h2>Rischi e Sfide</h2>
<p>Portare avanti un progetto culturale è sempre impegnativo, in questo periodo di pandemia ci è stato detto che siamo coraggiosi a provarci (e forse un po' incoscienti?).</p>
<p>Vogliamo essere sinceri con te e ti assicuriamo che il progetto lo realizzeremo, a prescindere dagli aiuti che riceveremo. La differenza? Faremo meno tappe, meno chilometri percorsi con il nostro furgoncino (affittato), meno persone incontrate (tra cui, magari, anche te). Aiutaci, quindi, a rendere ItinerDante un progetto di portata nazionale e un piccolo passo per tornare ""a riveder le stelle"".<br/> </p>

<h2> </h2>
<h2>Altri modi in cui puoi aiutarci</h2>
</div><div>
<p>Lo scopo del progetto è generare momenti di commozione, riflessioni ed esperienze di valore collettivi grazie ai versi della Divina Commedia. Lo faremo nelle piazze e per le vie dei borghi e delle città Italiane per tutte le persone che vorranno assistere, gratuitamente, ai nostri spettacoli di piazza. Ma possiamo anche personalizzare le nostre performance e farle, su richiesta, proprio per te! Sempre per aiutare la nostra causa e consentirci di fare qualche chilometro in più,<strong> puoi donare un brano a tua scelta dedicandolo alla persona che vorrai!</strong></p>

</div></div>","Vuoi fare un regalo originale e non sai cosa fare? Seleziona una dedica (perk) e gli attori dei Naufraghi inversi la realizzeranno per te! La Divina Commedia è piena di passi celebri che parlano d’amore (Paolo e Francesca) di coraggio e sfide da affrontare (Ulisse) ecc. ecc,. con cui potrai celebrare occasioni di ogni tipo. I Naufraghi InVersi reciteranno il brano che avrai scelto e te lo invieranno con la dedica che avrai pensato per la persona a cui vorrai donarlo. Un modo originale e “unico”  per fare un regalo di valore, contribuendo nel contempo a una buona causa: il progetto ItinerDante – Italian Street Tour. 
 Dedica 33 versi alla persona che desideri! Reciteremo per lei i versi da te scelti! 
 
---------------------- 
Qualsiasi sia la selva, l'essenziale è ritrovare la via. 

 
Per celebrare il 700esimo anniversario della morte del sommo poeta abbiamo dato vita a «ItinerDante - Italian Street Tour», un’iniziativa che porterà i canti dell’Inferno dantesco in performance itineranti per le regioni italiane. Scopo del progetto è quello di coinvolgere il maggior numero di persone possibili per riscoprire, insieme, i fondamenti della nostra cultura. Per farlo, attraverseremo l’Italia in un percorso lungo 700 km che coinvolgerà città, piccoli comuni, località turistiche e «luoghi danteschi». Sarà un modo per celebrare i tesori del Bel Paese con la più importante opera letteraria di tutti i tempi, ma anche un’occasione per riflettere, collettivamente, sulla nostra umanità al tempo del Covid.
Attraverso la declamazione dei canti danteschi in versione originale e in italiano attuale, le nostre performance di piazza consentono, infatti, di riscoprire tutta l’attualità della Divina Commedia che, parlando dei vizi e delle aree oscure dell’animo umano, parla di tutti noi e della società di oggi, sollecitandoci a ripensare le nostre vite per tornare, tutti insieme dopo la pandemia, “a riveder le stelle”. 
 
Lo Street Tour di ItinerDante ha raccolto l'interesse di numerose realtà culturali nazionali e ottenuto il patrocinio dell'Associazione Italianisti - Gruppo Dante, la Società Dante Alighieri, dell'Hypermedia Dante Network e dell'ENAC (Ente Nazionale Attività Culturali).Hanno già parlato di noi (tra l’altro):

Vogue
ilSole24Ore
La Repubblica
IoDonna

Qui puoi trovare la rassegna stampa completa. 
 

Perché sostenerci
Per darci una mano a portare i canti di Dante e le riflessioni che esse sollecitano nel maggior numero di piazze italiane. Più persone potremo coinvolgere, più emozioni riusciremo a generare, più grande sarà il contributo che riusciremo a dare (nel nostro piccolo) alla ripresa culturale del nostro Paese dopo i mesi bui della pandemia. Il progetto non ha fini di lucro e il viaggio (700 chilometri in 7 regioni italiane) sarà per noi impegnativo in tutti i sensi. Col il tuo aiuto puoi aggiungere “benzina” al progetto e allungare il nostro percorso per l’Italia. Noi ci impegniamo a viaggiare finché avremo benzina. Nel momento in cui finirà torneremo a casa.   

 
Cosa ti offriamo
Abbiamo pensato a dei regali-premi di ringraziamento personalizzati. Si parte da una foto digitale autografata, passiamo alla locandina dell'evento e si arriva fino a una traccia audio con uno spezzone di Canto della Divina a tua scelta e con dedica personalizzata.Insomma, mica pizza e fichi. 

 
Il tuo aiuto 
Per il momento abbiamo già alcune tappe programmate per il nostro tour, ad esempio: 

Milano - Lombardia
Dervio - Lombardia
Torri del Benaco - Veneto 
Ravenna - Emilia Romagna
Bagnacavallo - Emilia Romagna
Poppi - Toscana
Castagneto Carducci - Toscana
Piombino - Toscana
Roma - Lazio
Assisi - Umbria 
Volterra - Umbria
Policoro - Basilicata
Accadia - Puglia 

 
► Consulta QUI tutte le date del tour!
Grazie al tuo supporto, saremo in grado di continuare il tour verso nuove mete, allacciarci la cintura, mettere in moto e partire alla conquista di città, capoluoghi e regioni! 
La lunghezza del nostro percorso è nella nostra volontà di non arrenderci, nei chilometri di strade asfaltate (e non) che percorreremo, nelle vie assolate in cui reciteremo e nelle tue mani che ci aiuteranno a camminare più lontano.  


 
Rischi e Sfide
Portare avanti un progetto culturale è sempre impegnativo, in questo periodo di pandemia ci è stato detto che siamo coraggiosi a provarci (e forse un po' incoscienti?).
Vogliamo essere sinceri con te e ti assicuriamo che il progetto lo realizzeremo, a prescindere dagli aiuti che riceveremo. La differenza? Faremo meno tappe, meno chilometri percorsi con il nostro furgoncino (affittato), meno persone incontrate (tra cui, magari, anche te). Aiutaci, quindi, a rendere ItinerDante un progetto di portata nazionale e un piccolo passo per tornare ""a riveder le stelle"". 

 
Altri modi in cui puoi aiutarci

Lo scopo del progetto è generare momenti di commozione, riflessioni ed esperienze di valore collettivi grazie ai versi della Divina Commedia. Lo faremo nelle piazze e per le vie dei borghi e delle città Italiane per tutte le persone che vorranno assistere, gratuitamente, ai nostri spettacoli di piazza. Ma possiamo anche personalizzare le nostre performance e farle, su richiesta, proprio per te! Sempre per aiutare la nostra causa e consentirci di fare qualche chilometro in più, puoi donare un brano a tua scelta dedicandolo alla persona che vorrai!
E ancora! Se sei un “vip” ? e vuoi realizzare un momento “Divino” tutto tuo, e puoi permettertelo, i Naufraghi Inversi possono mettere in scena, solo per te e per le persone che vorrai invitare, uno spettacolo riservato e personalizzato. Il format messo a punto dalla compagnia consente di generare rappresentazioni in spazi di qualsiasi tipo e dimensioni (nel rispetto delle norme di distanziamento Covid19). Basta chiedere!
 

 
Non puoi donare? Non ti preoccupare, capiamo perfettamente che potrebbe essere un periodo duro anche per te.

Virago Theatre Company, a champion of new plays by SF Bay Area playwrights, just wrapped a 3 week run of award-winning playwright William Bivin's twisted dark comedy Ransom, Texas at Tides Theatre in San Francisco. Now we have the opportunity to bring it to Hollywood for a 3 week run! 
Ransom, Texas will perform at Theatre Asylum, in the heart of Theatre Row, home to the most award-winning and critically acclaimed live theater companies in Los Angeles.

Bivins's Ransom, Texas is a ""twisting game of one-upmanship"" (SF Gate) that grabs hold and never lets go. Set in
a small West Texas town, a father and son locked in the office of a
factory battle for power using whatever they've
got: manipulation, mind-games, lies, and brute force. Keeping us off-guard with twists and reveals, this emotionally compelling dark comedy is ""tense, terse and unremitting. The acting is brilliant, the staging perfect."" (The Writer's Block, SF). Ransom, Texas stars Dixon Phillips as Vern, ""a man of deep truth, violent, tender"" and Damien Seperi as Bruce, ""violent, perceptive...treacherous"" (The Writer's Block). Ransom is directed by Bay Area visionary Jon Tracy, known for his masterful work in the Bay Area and beyond, with set design by superb scenic designer Nina Ball.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<div>My name is Claire and I am the Artistic Director of Theatre Street. Having had many experiences as a Child of performing and also as a young Adult I know what a difference it can make to a Child's confidence and life to be full of wonderful moments and experiences that will stay with you for a life time. I loved it so much that now I spend all my time sharing my knowledge and experiences with others so that they to can build moments of their own like it. </div>
<div>The Children who attend our Glee Choir come because they love to sing, build friendships and feel part of something special. Each Child to me is different and unique and it is important to me that they all feel valued and rewarded for their positive contribution to the group. The days we are in with distractions of technology etc makes it even more important that we support and encourage Children who come out and take part in activities either for the pure enjoyment of it or they wish to make a career from singing and performing. Having a variety of ages in the group makes it extra special as the little ones look up to the older Children and our Glee group has a real family feel about it but also with a big exciting buzz of creativity. </div>
<div>With your support the Younger Children will gain from seeing the older ones take part in the competition ,'it will give them something to aspire to. Also the older Children benefit from the experience and can teach the younger ones what they have learnt from it. Also it will give the older ones more confidence to continue. Then hopefully they can all join together to present a performance which is all about the 'Human Heart' a showcase based on Love! I am sure you agree that the World can always do with a little more Love!!!</div>

</div></div>","We are two North West based performers GiIlian Hardie and Keddy Sutton.
We met whilst appearing together in Willy Russell’s remix of ‘Stags n Hens,’ during The Capital of Culture at The Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool 2008. With a combined love of improvisation, comedy and Musical Theatre we began creating our own material shortly after and showcased it as part of Liverpool based, Spike Theatre's fundraiser. We got laughs and our alter egos Caz 'n' Britney were born. 
We developed these characters whilst touring the comedy/cabaret circuit including, Lavender Girls (Homotopia), Unity Theatre, Women in Comedy Arts festival Manchester, Miss Alternative Liverpool, L Fest, Liverpool Pride, L Talent on The HMS President London, The Everyman Theatre Liverpool farewell Cabaret, Laughing Cows, Frog and Bucket Manchester, Lodestar, Spike Theatre, Walking with Giants, The Tate Modern, Come on Girls, Dolman’s Disco, Funny’s funny, The Palm House, Crosby Comrades, Theatre Royal St Helens with special guest star ‘Margi Clarke,’
We wanted to develop the act into a full scale show and were given the opportunity by Unity Theatre based company 'Homotopia' 
Their support helped us to write 'SCOTTIE ROAD THE MUSICAL', the tale of pyjama wearing, pastie scoffing 'the inimitable ‘Caz n Britney,’ and their life-changing journey from Primark to Prison, a heartfelt tale and homage to the wonderful world of musical theatre. 

The show was a 'cell' out success, (with an extra date being added to accommodate the demand) at the Unity Theatre, and again at The Epstein Theatre, Liverpool.

This show is a spotlight on a woman dealing with betrayal, public humiliation, private struggle and what it takes to put the world before yourself.


My name is Lucy Campbell, I'm an Australian living in New York City. My purpose as an actress and writer is to inspire people, open their hearts and connect with their humanity.  Right now I am on my own journey, doing everything in my power to create an amazing life and to have a positive impact on people and the world around them no matter what it takes.

<p>I am a French dancer, actress, writer and knitter currently living in New York. After graduating from theater school, I found the endless game of auditions and rejections to be draining and not at all exciting creatively. Around the same time, I was dealing with a serious case of homesickness, and found myself pondering the plight of the first immigrants, that often had no hope of ever going back home. </p>
<p>More and more creatively restless, I decided to start working on a one person show that would involve both acting and movement, and would intricately bind my own experience with that of my Russian great grandmother, who emigrated to France with my great grandfather and ended up losing her mind. As I began working on the project, the concept of exile broadened, and I found myself wanting to address the feeling I've had ever since I was a child, to be exiled on Earth from ""another place"", one I can't quite shake the nostalgia of.</p>
<p>Therefore, the piece became an allegory using both my ancestor's story and my own relationship with God and the Divine throughout my childhood and adolescence. It's a very personal show for me, and it allows me to stretch my creative muscle in three directions at once, writing, performing and choreographing it. </p>

<h3>Une quête de sens</h3>
<p>Je suis une danseuse, actrice, écrivain et tricoteuse vivant actuellement à New York. Une fois diplômée de l'école de théâtre, j'ai trouvé le jeu sans fin des auditions et des rejets épuisant et pas du tout excitant créativement. Vers la même époque, je me senti terrassée par le mal du pays, et je me surpris à méditer sur le sort des premiers immigrants, qui n'avaient souvent aucun espoir de rentrer un jour chez eux.</p>
<p>Ma créativité étant de plus en plus frustrée, je décidai de commencer à travailler sur un solo qui utiliserait à la fois le jeu et le mouvement, et lierait intimement ma propre expérience avec celle de mon arrière grand-mère russe, qui emigra en France avec mon arrière grand-père et finit par devenir folle. Lorsque je commençai à travailler sur le projet, le concept d'exil s'élargit, et je me trouvai vouloir aborder le sentiment que j'ai depuis que je suis enfant, d'être exilée sur Terre, de venir d' ""un autre endroit"", dont je n'arrive pas vraiment à guériri la nostalgie.</p>
<p>Par conséquent, le spectacle devint une allégorie utilisant à la fois l'histoire de mon ancêtre et ma propre relation avec Dieu et le Divin au long de mon enfance et adolescence. C'est un spectacle très personnel, et il me permet de développer ma créativité dans trois domaines à la fois, l'écriture, la comédie et la chorégraphie.</p>
<h3>Comment vous pouvez m'aider!</h3>

Voici comment votre contribution sera utilisée si je remplis mon objectif:</p>
<p>$500 seront utilisés pour la location d'environ 40h de studio de répétition entre maintenant et le 26 mai pour que je puisse travailler sur les parties dansées du solo, ainsi que sur son developpement dans l'espace.</p>
<p>$150 seront consacrés à l'impression du matériel promotionnel pour la performance à EAT ainsi que les performances suivantes à The Hive à Brooklyn au début de Juin.</p>
<p>$200 iront à l'embauche d'un technicien du son/lumière pour la soirée du 26</p>
<p>$150 seront consacrés à l'achat de quelques accessoires dont j'ai encore besoin (J'ai fait en sorte que le spectacle soit le plus léger possible, mais j'ai encore besoin de quelques objets à mettre dans ma valise de migrante :))</p>
<p>$500 iront à payer ma merveilleuse metteuse en scène, Kate Szekely, qui donne de son temps gratuitement depuis Janvier et serait prête à continuer jusqu'en mai (mais s'il vous plaît aidez moi à la payer :))</p>
<h3>Quoi d'autre?</h3>
<p>Eh bien, c'est tout ... Ce projet est très cher à mon coeur, et je crois aussi qu'il aborde quelque chose que j'ai rarement vu discuté sur scène.

Formed over 17 years ago, we strive to undertake amazing, unique projects that will develop confidence and performance skills in young people that they can use in their future; be it on stage, on screen or in their every day lives.  To this end we firmly believe it should not be that you can afford to  'pay to be talented' and our opportunities are therefore affordable for all.  We harness young energy and enthusiasm, throw in a measure of theatre skills and techniques, give opportunities to work with industry professionals whilst creating new musicals, performing established works and allowing the young people to gain recognition and awards in various festivals, performances and competitions on a local, national and international stage.  However equally important is that they also appreciate and interact with their local community and to this end, we can often be found entertaining at old people's homes and singing at community concerts.</p><p>The project:</p><p>
A couple of years ago, we were contacted by a travel company who were looking for a young person's theatre group to host a group of young people from McCurdy Theatre Arts. They were going to visit Cardiff for a day as part of a tour of UK and wanted to perform.  Always on the look out for something different for our youngsters to participate in, we welcomed our guests, had an evening of singing for each other and made friends along the way.  This year we are getting together again to collaborate on a new Musical - 
Cult the Musical.  Our
visitors will arrive in Cardiff during August for a week of rehearsals with our
young people, undertake social and cultural activities, homestay with our young
people and then we will all travel together to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival to
perform at Venue 13 for a week.  

</p><p>The total
project cost for the UK part of the project will be £11,370. Of this the young people will be
contributing towards their accommodation in Edinburgh, subsistence in Edinburgh
and their travel costs to get to Edinburgh.<span> 
Additionally our visitors from USA will be covering the costs of their
travel to Cardiff and back.  </span></p><p>
</p><p>However,
there are a number of aspects of the project that we need to raise funds
towards including production costs and cultural aspects. There is the cost of rehearsal
and performance venue hire, fringe entry, costumes, props, set, posters, t.shirts
and programmes.<span>  Then there are travel
costs for our visitors to and from rehearsals, subsistence during rehearsal
times, cultural activities such as visits to sites of specific interest in
Cardiff and group activities to get to know each other. </span></p><p>
</p><p>Total
anticipated shortfall is £2500.<span>  </span></p><p>

Formed over 17 years ago, we strive to undertake amazing, unique projects that will develop confidence and performance skills in young people that they can use in their future; be it on stage, on screen or in their every day lives.  To this end we firmly believe it should not be that you can afford to  'pay to be talented' and our opportunities are therefore affordable for all.  We harness young energy and enthusiasm, throw in a measure of theatre skills and techniques, give opportunities to work with industry professionals whilst creating new musicals, performing established works and allowing the young people to gain recognition and awards in various festivals, performances and competitions on a local, national and international stage.  However equally important is that they also appreciate and interact with their local community and to this end, we can often be found entertaining at old people's homes and singing at community concerts.The project:
A couple of years ago, we were contacted by a travel company who were looking for a young person's theatre group to host a group of young people from McCurdy Theatre Arts. They were going to visit Cardiff for a day as part of a tour of UK and wanted to perform.  Always on the look out for something different for our youngsters to participate in, we welcomed our guests, had an evening of singing for each other and made friends along the way.  This year we are getting together again to collaborate on a new Musical - 
Cult the Musical.  Our
visitors will arrive in Cardiff during August for a week of rehearsals with our
young people, undertake social and cultural activities, homestay with our young
people and then we will all travel together to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival to
perform at Venue 13 for a week.  

The total
project cost for the UK part of the project will be £11,370. Of this the young people will be
contributing towards their accommodation in Edinburgh, subsistence in Edinburgh
and their travel costs to get to Edinburgh. 
Additionally our visitors from USA will be covering the costs of their
travel to Cardiff and back.  
However,
there are a number of aspects of the project that we need to raise funds
towards including production costs and cultural aspects. There is the cost of rehearsal
and performance venue hire, fringe entry, costumes, props, set, posters, t.shirts
and programmes.  Then there are travel
costs for our visitors to and from rehearsals, subsistence during rehearsal
times, cultural activities such as visits to sites of specific interest in
Cardiff and group activities to get to know each other. 
Total
anticipated shortfall is £2500.  
We can
offer our sponsors acknowledgement on our facebook group, in our show
programme, a Cult the Musical t.shirt or tickets to our show in Edinburgh or to
future shows that the company undertakes.
Our
project is important to the young people on both sides of the pond because it
will give them an opportunity to experience performing at a world class
festival, giving them a taste for life in the ‘real’ performance world.  It will also enable them to watch a wide
variety of performances that they would otherwise not be exposed to.  As participants in the festival, they will
also become audience members for other performers, thus enabling those shows to
showcase their work to a wider audience. 

This will
be the 9th time that The Unknown Theatre Company has visited
Edinburgh.  In each of those visits we
have taken a new musical that we either commissioned, was written for or with
us or had permission from the composer/writer to perform.  It is an amazing opportunity, yet again for

entirely on our own funding efforts to make these projects happen.  And happen they do!  The small committee of volunteers, together

<p>My name is Frank Marquette and I’m a professional
actor, writer, director, producer, artist and sales and marketing wizard with
over 35 years of passion in each discipline. In 1998 I combined all of my experiences
and gave birth to <a href=""www.murdercafe.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Murder Café</a> in Las Vegas, Nevada. My purpose was to offer
residents and company groups comedy-musical murder mystery plays, a genre we
lifted to new heights. (Yes, many do it badly.) During our 11 year run in Sin
City, our little family-run theatre company took us in many unexpected
directions. For eight years we had the only family-oriented Christmas show in
Las Vegas, that being our celebrated dinner theater version of Charles Dickens’
classic, <i>A Christmas Carol</i>. Not only
were we an annual fixture at Lawry’s Prime Rib Restaurant, we presented a
condensed version of the play at dozens of schools in the greater Las Vegas
area. This first venture into educational theatre was unwritten by The Rotary
Club and it exposed hundreds of underserved students to their first live
performance. Elementary school kids throughout the city were excited and
engaged when they met Scrooge, the Ghosts of Christmas and Charles Dickens
himself. Bringing literature to life became an essential part of our purpose.</p>
<p>In 2009 we returned “home” to the Hudson Valley of
New York State and brought Murder Café with us. We continued producing quality
comedies, musicals and murder mysteries but also put a lot of our efforts into
fundraising, educational programs and community outreach. Scrooge and Dickens
found a new home in New York and since they were embraced by area residents we
added Edgar Allan Poe. In 2010 we were commissioned by the Poughkeepsie Library
District to create an original play based on the works of Poe. This was part of
the library’s Big Read program funded by the National Endowment for the Arts. Over
the past three years Mr. Poe has made numerous appearances throughout the area,
most notably on stage at Columbia-Greene Community College in Hudson, New York.
</p>
<p>The research involved in writing and producing my
original play <i>Poe’s Last Mystery</i> led
us to historical reenactments and a series of “haunted” shows. Last year my
acting troupe began performing as historical characters at the Mills Mansion in
Staatsburg, the Morton Library in Rhinecliff and the Vanderbilt House in
Philmont. Those shows presented actors performing as both historical figures
and ghosts who have been known to haunt the locations mentioned. Our original series,
<i>A Haunting on the Hudson: voices from the
past</i>, a site specific play, has recently been requested by the Rhinecliff
Hotel, Emmett’s Castle in Pearl River, the Shandley Hotel in Naponoch and
Museum Village in Monroe. Considering the history of the mid-Hudson Valley our
venture into history and hauntings has unlimited possibilities.</p>
<p>I’m proud to tell you because of our haunting shows,
we introduced a lot of people to President Lincoln’s funeral ghost train. That
is a story worth Googling!</p>
<p>In order to bring living theatre that is both
educational and entertaining to area historic sites, schools and colleges,
libraries and museums we created a company called Theatre on the Road. Yes,
there are many superb theatre companies in New York State but none quite share
our business model and plan. Simply put, our purpose is to expose the magic of
theatre to people who normally don’t go to the theatre and that’s an idea we
have found to be pretty unique. Let me expand on this. Who isn’t afraid of
Shakespeare? Using the four-scene, dinner theatre format we’ve been using in Murder
Café for the past 16 years, we are going to launch <i>A Taste of Shakespeare: bite sized portions presented by William
Shakespeare</i>. This original production offers four classic and timely scenes
with the Bard acting as host and narrator. Like everything else we do the
proverbial “fourth wall” will be torn down and audiences will have an
opportunity to interact with the characters they’ve been avoiding since 11<sup>th</sup>
grade.<span>  </span></p>
<p>How about a little variety? Our original show, <i>The Legend of Charlie and Myrtle: A History
of Vaudeville in America,</i> will walk the audience through the history of
what was once our most popular form of live entertainment. Students and the
public alike will be amazed by a presentation set in 1914 that features singers
comedy, jugglers, dancers, musicians, magic and a roster of performers who
later became household names. Fortunately there are a number of theatres in the
Hudson Valley that once housed vaudeville shows. How retro! How amusing! How enlightening!
</p>
<p>Using professional actors, carefully researched
scripts and handmade and historically accurate costumes and production values,
we will be filling a need and many rooms. Without leaving their schools or
local venues, both students and the public alike will have access to living
history and literature like never before. People will be entertained by, and
can interact with, the likes of Poe, Dickens, Washington Irving, Thomas Cole,
Henry Hudson, Sojourner Truth, Matthew Vassar and Cornelius Vanderbilt to name
a few. Our performers and storytellers will also include common folk whose labor
and creativity made the Hudson Valley what it is today. Students will learn
from artists, farmers, canal workers and those who both divided and united us –
Native Americans, Dutch settlers, and British occupiers and explorers.</p>
<p>We can sum this up in one simple phrase: Live is
better! We are not only passionate about this campaign but believe it is our
responsibility to bring living history and literature to area students and the
general public. As the Hudson Valley continues to expand with tourists and new
homeowners we are thrilled at the prospect of entertaining young and old, at
school or at a local institution, in an appealing and painless way. </p>

</ul><p>We are uniquely qualified to follow

performance. We created <i>Poe’s Last
Mystery</i> and successfully brought Edgar Allan Poe to area schools, theatres
and libraries. And we presented historic figures like Cornelius Vanderbilt and
Matthew Vassar to local homes and inns that claim to be haunted. Who better to
expand all of these creations than us? </p><ul></ul><p></p> <p> </p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>We’re passionate but we don’t wear
rose colored glasses. Business is business and we realize it comes with
roadblocks that sometimes seem difficult to cross. In addition to our artistic
endeavors, we also have 35 years in corporate sales and marketing and graphic
design. We’re also up to speed on web marketing and social media. We’ve been marketing
Murder Café successfully for 16 years along with the venues we perform in.
Promotion is a full time job, so whether it’s writing press releases, or
designing posters, flyers and mailers we’re prepared. We also prepared to work
with school officials and administrators, museum and library directors, theatre
managers and restaurant owners of every type. With Murder Café we average 45
shows a year so we can handle almost any situation.</p>

<strong>BREAKING NEWS:  PHANTOMWISE has been invited to perform at the New York International Fringe Festival!!! </strong> We couldn't be more thrilled.  This means we're working towards a <strong>fully produced production of PHANTOMWISE for the Fringe by August</strong>.  Our total fundraising goal with be $10,000 -- anything exceeding our initial goal will go towards the 10,000 dollar Fringe budget.  <strong>Please help us by spreading the word - the more people we can get to donate even five dollars, the closer we get to making this a reality!</strong>

<p>Dear friends, family, supporters of the arts, and amazing humans,</p>
<p>In 1862, Charles Dodgson told a girl named Alice Liddell a story about another Alice who fell down a rabbit hole into a world called Wonderland.  </p>
<p><em>Alice in Wonderland</em> is a story that captured both of our imaginations as children -- as it has so very many -- and it has intrigued us both well beyond those early years:  especially when we became better acquainted with the figure of Alice Liddell herself.</p>
<p><strong>Sweeping between fantasy and reality, Oren Stevens' PHANTOMWISE tells the story of Alice Liddell's life and her relationship with the Wonderland story she inspired.  </strong></p>
<p>PHANTOMWISE had a very successful student production with the Yale dramat in 2010 under the direction of Maya Seidler.  Avital and Oren had met in a theatre design class at Yale, and it was at an early table read in preparation for the dramat production that Avital fell in love with Oren's play.  By the time it was performed, Avital had graduated and it was another two years before Oren finished Yale and moved to New York.  Now both artists in the ""real world,"" Avital and Oren began talking last fall about how they might further develop PHANTOMWISE.</p>
<p><strong>We are very excited to be continuing PHANTOMWISE's development in the Big Apple!  For this, we need your help.</strong></p>
<p>We are working towards a eventual professional production of this play, but need first to develop the text with a company of professional actors.  This will allow us to take risks and further develop the text before sharing our process with you in a staged reading on Thursday, May 24th.</p>
<p>As you know, producing theatre in New York is expensive.  We need to be able to rent rehearsal space, rent a performance venue for the staged reading, and honor the time and commitment of our artists.  Also, if you have any leads on reduced rate/donated rehearsal space please do let us know.  This could make a huge difference in the success of this campaign.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you in advance for your generous support and we hope to see you all at our reading this May!  </strong></p>

<p>We are working hard to get me to NY this summer, so even if we don't make our goal all the money will go toward that end.  I am also working odd jobs and making hairbows, earrings and decorated pointe shoes to sell.  These lovely items, designed by mom and me will also be offered as part of the perks for you lovely donors out there!  And if we are blessed enough to<strong> raise more than our goal, 100% of the money will go toward additional training/workshop opportunities</strong> for which I qualify.</p>

WHAT INSPIRES ME?   
I owe much of my success to the fact that I have been super lucky to have John Grensback, the director of OBA as my teacher!  He was a principal dancer with the Houston Ballet; he danced with the Joffrey and with the New York City Ballet and was put under contract by George Balanchine himself.
One of my very favorite stories that John told us was about the time he was in class with Mikhail Baryshnikov!  He said that Mikhail watched him (John) do a combination then said ""You're pretty good...  I'll have to work harder!""  I never forgot that story and have been inspired and motivated by it ever since.  I work very hard every day on my technique....you know....for when I just happen to take class with Svetlana Zakharova or Natalia Osipova.......!

We are working hard to get me to NY this summer, so even if we don't make our goal all the money will go toward that end.  I am also working odd jobs and making hairbows, earrings and decorated pointe shoes to sell.  These lovely items, designed by mom and me will also be offered as part of the perks for you lovely donors out there!  And if we are blessed enough to raise more than our goal, 100% of the money will go toward additional training/workshop opportunities for which I qualify.
Being a Ballet Dancer is a career that starts very, very young and ends sooner than most.  That is why there is a sense of urgency here. As with any profession, the best education in one's chosen field is part of achieving the level of ability required to be able to obtain success at a high level.  
SAB is like the Harvard or Yale of ballet schools and being invited to study there is quite a privilege!   To put it into perspective, the next 4 years of my dance education is like my college! By age 17 I should be apprenticing with a major company (I hope!)  So, I'm starting now and with your help I can find a way to give a little beauty back to the world.
The impact your generosity will have on me and my family is hard to quantify.  Helping me be part of  a rarified and unique art form such as Ballet is an investment not only in me but in the preservation of a much under appreciated iconic art form.  Those who dedicate their lives to The Ballet are passionately committed, hard working and fierce! Please let me prove to you that I can flourish in that arena and take the impact you will have made on me to turn around and make an impact on the ballet world!  
OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP:


No donation is too small.  Every penny is like a step in a beautiful dance choreographed by you! With each of those steps getting me closer and closer to performing on the world's greatest stages. And even if you can't donate at this time, you can be the music by letting your voice be heard. If you know someone who appreciates the fine arts, please just lead them to my campaign!  Your kindness and faith in me would be like the beating of a butterfly's wings rippling out into a mysterious and beautiful universe!

<p><strong>Here’s the Story…</strong></p>
<p>As I explain in the video, my name is Whitney and I was born and raised in Greensburg, KS. On May 4<sup>th</sup>, 2007 our small town was 95% destroyed by a 1.7 mile wide tornado.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://images.wikia.com/tornado/images/0/05/Greensburg_Tornado_Damage.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: top;""/></p>
<p>It has taken a lot of blood, sweat, and tears, but we have turned our town around! Many homes and businesses have already been rebuilt in an environmentally sustainable way! We are the <strong>only</strong> town in America that has majority LEED certified buildings (think really, really green). <strong>We still have a long way to go to “fully” recover and one project left to rebuild is our Twilight Theatre.</strong> The former theatre stood proud in our community for 90 years before being completely destroyed</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.thelope.com/images/07-05-08-268.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
<p>Greensburg will never be the same without such a signature part of our community being reborn. The exterior is now finished, but significant funding is still needed to finish the interior. Many items have been donated from various companies such as a popcorn machine, the movie screen, lighting, sound, etc. None of this will matter without having somewhere for the people to sit!</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i284.photobucket.com/albums/ll11/GrantNeuhold/final.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
<p>This building will not just be a movie theatre. The Twilight Theatre and Community Auditorium will host school functions such as plays, concerts, programs and award shows. It will hold hundreds of community members for Veterans Day ceremonies, Christmas pageants and town meetings. It will spark renewed excitement for local artists and performers to come and share their talent, too!</p>

<p><strong>The Impact: Decades of Memories</strong></p>
<p>Now it is time to <strong>bring back a part of history</strong> and make it available for many generations to come! This isn’t just a single play we are funding that will run its course and be forgotten. It isn’t a film with a beginning and end only to be enjoyed a few times. <strong>This will be a place where memories are made, laughter and quality time will be shared, and a community can feel whole once again.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What we need and what you get!</strong></p>
<p>Right now we are raising $75,000 to complete the seating. We will be able to seat over 400 in this incredible, state of the art Twilight Theatre. There are other components to be completed as well, but seating is a crucial element! Your generous donation will not only get us one step closer to closing out another element of rebuilding, it will also encourage others to do the same!! <strong>We also want to give back to you for donating!</strong> As you can see along the right hand side of the page, there are rewards for each donation level. I don’t know about you, but the thought of having my name or a memorial for a loved one on a seat that will be in this building for decades to come is amazing! Every little bit helps! You will receive a personal thank you along with the appreciation of an entire community.</p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Before I even introduce myself I want to say thank you. Thank you for even reading this. Ok. Now...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Sam Picart</span> and I am a Junior at the Cornish College of the Arts in Seattle.I have been training in dance for three years, mainly in ballet. Before my training I lived in Blue Springs, Missouri. As a kid I would watch hip hop and funk dancers on Youtube in my room and I'd try to imitate what the dancers were doing while watching myself in the mirror. I was stunned and amazed at how the human body could move and I wanted all of those 'super powers' that made me feel so inspired. Dancing was the only way I could truly express myself so it made sense that I would pursue it as a career dream.  At age 18 I left my home to live with my dad here in Seattle. I wanted to take a leap of faith and try to become a serious dancer. Most professional dancers start at a very young age so I knew then that my journey would be a long and difficult one.  Through luck, love from family and friends, and hard work I was accepted into a wonderful college in Seattle. When things happen to you like that it makes you believe that this life is meant for something special.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>Through audition I was recently selected to attend <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Joffrey Ballet School's Summer Intensive Program in New York City</span>. The thing is I have always been afraid to audition for anything and with the right push(or violent shove) from the right people I actually showed up. With all the power and confidence I might have on stage, it dwindles when it comes to putting myself out there with the likes of other talented people and especially leaving my home to do it. I think it was an amazing miracle and blessing to have been accepted into this program. I don't know about some but I never thought something like this could happen to me until I read the acceptance email yesterday morning(February 24, 2012). I have never been to the East Coast and being from a small town in the Midwest its rather intimidating to say the least. None the less I must chase my dream and with the right training I feel as if I could be a well-rounded artist with success in the dance world. My experience in New York would be a great launching point for my dance career and I know that is the reality.<br/><p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>I'm not going to lie to you I heard New York is kind of expensive so I think that's why this program is so pricey. For this trip to be possible I need 5000 dollars.This money will pay for the four-week tuition, registration, housing fees, transportation, and the meal plan so I can have the energy a dancer needs! If I can't reach my minimum goal of $5000 I will use what I have and send videos of myself crying to family and friends that didn't donate. I also will be putting in extra hours at work and praying to the heavens that I get what I need and I believe things will work out. <span style=""font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"">And just know even $5 goes a long way :)</span></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am a local writer and community worker, coworking with a fantastic group of people, many of whom were involved in the <a href=""http://creatabot.co.uk/2013/04/07/chatham-clinic-open-19th-may-2013/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Survived</a> project this May.  I also run <a href=""http://seasonallyeffected.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Seasonally Effected</a> an open mic night for creatives at the Dot Cafe in Rochester.</p>
<p>The Skywatcher will be an exciting mix of interactive, site specific theatre and scavenger hunting around the City of Rochester.  The audience will visit six scenes, in different Rochester locations, each based on a piece of classic science fiction stories.  They will also solve puzzles, explore and have loads of fun on the way.  We love Rochester and think this is a great way to share this with other people.</p>
<p>By supporting this event, you will help us to create printed materials and fund additional props, costumes and artwork.   This will enhance the audience experience and help us to run a fantastic event.    </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We are looking for any amount up to £2000 to contribute towards running the event.    Some of this will pay for printed materials, but the majority will be used for props, costumes and any special effects that we can get our hands on!</li>
<li>We have a range of perks available for funders, ranging from props used during the event to advertising and making a business part of the event.</li>
<li>The event will be running whatever funding we receive, any funding raised will be divided amongst the six scenes to give each a small budget for costume and props.  </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>By supporting this project, you will do a bit (or a lot) to help make Rochester an even more exciting, creative place.  We hope this will spark people's imaginations and introduce people to some of the lesser known landmarks, businesses and sites. </li>
<li>Our experience from the Survived project, has helped us put together a strong team of creatives who will be working tirelessly to develop The Skywatcher and make it a fresh and entertaining show.</li>
<li>Most of all support this, because someones got to find out what those lights were over the castle! </li>
</ul>
<p></p>

The Skywatcher will be an exciting mix of interactive, site specific theatre and scavenger hunting around the City of Rochester.  The audience will visit six scenes, in different Rochester locations, each based on a piece of classic science fiction stories.  They will also solve puzzles, explore and have loads of fun on the way.  We love Rochester and think this is a great way to share this with other people.
By supporting this event, you will help us to create printed materials and fund additional props, costumes and artwork.   This will enhance the audience experience and help us to run a fantastic event.    


What We Need & What You Get

We are looking for any amount up to £2000 to contribute towards running the event.    Some of this will pay for printed materials, but the majority will be used for props, costumes and any special effects that we can get our hands on!
We have a range of perks available for funders, ranging from props used during the event to advertising and making a business part of the event.
The event will be running whatever funding we receive, any funding raised will be divided amongst the six scenes to give each a small budget for costume and props.  



The Impact

By supporting this project, you will do a bit (or a lot) to help make Rochester an even more exciting, creative place.  We hope this will spark people's imaginations and introduce people to some of the lesser known landmarks, businesses and sites. 
Our experience from the Survived project, has helped us put together a strong team of creatives who will be working tirelessly to develop The Skywatcher and make it a fresh and entertaining show.
Most of all support this, because someones got to find out what those lights were over the castle!
