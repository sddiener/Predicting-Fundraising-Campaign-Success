<p style=""text-align: justify;"">*** During our adventures, we have accumulated dozens of stories, fruit of meetings with locals and other travellers. <b>These stories are part of our life because we live them as a traveller.</b> But to our relatives and friends, they are pieces of dream, which take them, temporarily, into another reality.</p>

This is a PHOTOGRAPHIC / VIDEO project, a collection of stories told by citizens of the world.

We collect stories in our life, most of the time unconsciously. People talking to us, at the office, at the shop, during a hair cut. Anecdotes, swiftly wiped by the irresistible time. Our brain records, analyses, interprets, outputs and conclude. We build our personality through accumulation of appropriate, striking stories.

We are Alice and Christophe.
* Alice is a professional photographer who works in the field of photography and video, and in the musical artistic scene in Italy. She is a traveller, a transnomadic photographer who loves going around the world for making pictures, trying to find the beauty in the life of the others and in the world itself. Her artistic work is displayed on fullfamelife.wordpress.com.

*Christophe is a traveller on the road for the last 10 years. He also developed along his initiatic quest a keen interest in photography and cinema. Some of  his work, photographic and video, are displayed on the blog kristosproductions.wordpress.com.
*** During our adventures, we have accumulated dozens of stories, fruit of meetings with locals and other travellers. These stories are part of our life because we live them as a traveller. But to our relatives and friends, they are pieces of dream, which take them, temporarily, into another reality.


(** this the handmade t-shirt!)


** We have the project of collecting stories from people all over the world, from January 2014, and compiled them in a book and a short movie. All kind of people, from students to lawyers, from gangsters to shopkeepers, from clerks to wild honey pickers; from street cleaners to circus artists; from atheists to believers; from different religions and cultures. 
Everybody has stories to tell, stemming from fairy tales or from personal lived experiences. They stay, there, somewhere in their subconscious memories, dormant, ready to surge and bounce up to the surface of consciousness. We want to make contribute these 'tellers' to our story collecting, share it with you and make you travel with us. We planned to collect stories for a period of six months. You will travel through our project by receiving news update and some of the collected stories on thestorycollectorproject.com and The Story Collector on Facebook and the Twitter Page.




*** We need for the realization of The Story Collector Project  a fund raising.5,000 EUR are claimed to cover partial costs of our trip.  and the publishing of a book containing stories and fine art portraits of the tellers. You will then receive a reward.
Our philosophy is to prepare you for a practical, invigorating experience of traveling. We would be so glad to be responsible for your big leaving adventure, discovering the world with your own perception and willpower. If you are already experienced traveller, you will enjoy our project as a keen aware amateur.
Further exhibitions with pictures and videos of story collection, as well as The Story Collector Project limited edition of the book for sale and a short movie, are planned for beginning 2015. 
We would require your help and generosity at above latest point.

*** Questo è un progetto di fotografia e video, una raccolta di storie raccontate dai cittadini del mondo.***
Nella nostra vita continuiamo a collezionare storie, la maggior parte inconsciamente. Le persone ci parlano, in ufficio, in un negozio, dal parrucchiere. Aneddoti, cancellati dal passare del tempo. Il nostro cervello registra, interpreta, digerisce e trae le sue conclusioni. Costruiamo la nostra personalità attraverso il sedimentarsi di casuali storie sorprendenti.

Siamo Alice e Christophe.
Alice e' una fotografa professionista, che lavora nel campo della fotografia e del video, e per lungo tempo ha lavorato sulla scena musicale italiana. E' una viaggiatrice, una fotografa transnomadica che ama girare il mondo e scovare la bellezza nelle vite degli altri e nel mondo stesso. I suoi lavori si possono vedere su fullfamelife.wordpress.com.Christophe e' un viaggiatore on the road che ha girato il mondo negli ultimi 10 anni. Ha sviluppato, lungo questo cammino, un vivo interesse per la fotografia e per il cinema.

Amanda Zins was born in the early 70's on the east side of post-riot Detroit. An early interest in all things creative augmented by ample time at home due to illness, fueled a prolific experimentation with many visual media.Fire stoked by city wide recognition and display through the Bates Academy for the Gifted and Talented and a scholarship offer from the Art Institute of Chicago, Amanda continued to work despite chronic and pervasive interruptions caused by an acute blood disorder.Channeling the anxieties, depressions and occasional rage that is a psychological dance partner with her disease , she has managed to create striking imagery on canvas, in photography, and mixed media that represent both victim of circumstance and vision of triumph. 
Having survived two near-death experiences (survival being the crucial element of the “near” part), my creations are not some wanton stab at a vague concept of immortality or some token “gift” that will last when my body is no longer capable of doing so.

I hope you can read my handwriting.




My Goal:
To be able to purchase items needed to participate in art fairs year round.  I need a pop-up tent, some tables, a credit card set up, lighting, things you need to run a small business that's generally held outdoors.I know with the holidays upon us, money is likely a bit tight for everyone.  I'll keep this short, and if I don't reach my goal, I'll run it again after the holidays.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p><b>HELP SAVE AN HISTORIC SAN FRANCISCO MURAL</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>In 1984, more than 30 artists and activists came together to form the project PLACA, to demonstrate - in visual terms - our opposition  to our government's wars of intervention in Central America and our solidarity and respect for the people from these nations, who were arriving in San Francisco's Mission District by the thousands as exiles from these wars. </p>PLACA transformed the neglected Balmy Alley, in the heart of the Mission, into an incredible outdoor art environment. Our mural, ""Culture Contains the Seed of Resistance that Blossoms into the Flower of Liberation,"" is the LAST REMAINING COMPLETE MURAL from 1984. Here is what the mural looked like shortly after it was completed nearly 30 years ago:</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><p><br/></p>

<p>Each
year the mural is viewed by thousands of people from around the
world, and photos of it have been published in many books and
magazines. But it is in desperate need of restoration. Here is what

In 1984, more than 30 artists and activists came together to form the project PLACA, to demonstrate - in visual terms - our opposition  to our government's wars of intervention in Central America and our solidarity and respect for the people from these nations, who were arriving in San Francisco's Mission District by the thousands as exiles from these wars. PLACA transformed the neglected Balmy Alley, in the heart of the Mission, into an incredible outdoor art environment. Our mural, ""Culture Contains the Seed of Resistance that Blossoms into the Flower of Liberation,"" is the LAST REMAINING COMPLETE MURAL from 1984. Here is what the mural looked like shortly after it was completed nearly 30 years ago:

Each
year the mural is viewed by thousands of people from around the
world, and photos of it have been published in many books and
magazines. But it is in desperate need of restoration. Here is what
it looks like today:








We
are preparing to restore the mural, otherwise it will have to be
removed. We can't let that happen. We will be using new materials
that will preserve it for much longer than was previously possible,
but we need your help to cover our expenses. Please donate if you
can, and/or get the word out to your friends.


Thank
you! ¡Gracias!

</div>
<p><b></b></p><h3><b>Our Goals.</b></h3><p></p>
<p>Have you ever wondered, what is it
like to die? Scarier yet, what happens after? Well, our cast and crew of
‘Damned in the Midst of Paradise’ want to answer those questions, and provide
it to you in the most emotionally engaging and cinematic fashion possible.  </p><p>We have a story of family, love and hate which follows a protagonist who, after losing everything, attempts to spit in the face of The Creator, and sets off on a path of his own self-destruction. </p>
<p>Our crew has the ambition and ability
to create a short film that pushes the boundaries of what a ‘student film’ can achieve, however, as you can imagine making a short film
isn’t easy and we could really use your help. </p>
<div>
<h3>How Can I Help? And What's In It For Me?</h3> <p></p>
<p>Our project is already raising quite
the production value; as well as the traditional funds required such as paying
for cast and crew, transport, locations, props etc. Our project’s narrative
spans many years and features two huge set pieces that will require both
attention to detail in terms of practical effect, sound and most importantly,
health and safety. Some of what we hope to achieve such as make up and set
pieces have a clear but fine line between tacky and believable. It would be your
donations and support which would help us cross that line.</p>
<p>Every penny is appreciated, any
donations big or small will be met with a thank you! You can donate any figure, so even if you can only spare  £1 that's entirely fine, just use the donation box to the right to enter any custom figure. However, to show our
deep appreciation for your support, we’ve already offered various perks for
those who donate specific figures. We hope you enjoy them, and yes, they are entirely optional. The
perks are listed on this page, they include various methods of thanks, copies of the film and the
chance to become a producer. There’s also the super
embarrassing but hopefully worthwhile perk that will see our director, Conor, cover
a Taylor Swift song of your choice. We doubt any of you will donate that much,
but should you prove us wrong you will surely be rewarded! &lt;3 – Points for improvisation...right?</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>So if we have your curiosity so far, let us get your attention, - this is exactly where your money would be going should you choose to help us;</div>
<div><ul>
<li>Set Pieces - We need to hire private land, build a fire, and ensure a safe working environment that allows our actors to interact with said fire. We have the land and the fire crew on stand by, it would be your money which makes it possible.</li>
<li>VHX, Practical Effects, - Our film will require a lot of extremely detailed practical effects which includes the burning of human skin, creating a demon, and successfully portraying what you see after your die. Your money will help us improve upon our practical effects but will also make the difference between our dying sequence being animated or (more ideally) practical. </li>
<li>The Essentials - Essential in the true meaning of the word. Our film's sense of scope requires multiple actors, locations - methods of transport, accommodation, - your money will be used as salary and our means of procuring a wonderful set located in the Mourne Mountains. It will also allow for us to get our equipment and crew to this location.</li>
<li>Production Value - The more money we can raise, the better this allows us to make every frame and every scene as best as it can be; such as allowing us to hire different equipment for night shoots, and the implementation of an original score.</li>

</div></div>","Our Goals.
Have you ever wondered, what is it
like to die? Scarier yet, what happens after? Well, our cast and crew of
‘Damned in the Midst of Paradise’ want to answer those questions, and provide
it to you in the most emotionally engaging and cinematic fashion possible.  We have a story of family, love and hate which follows a protagonist who, after losing everything, attempts to spit in the face of The Creator, and sets off on a path of his own self-destruction. 
Our crew has the ambition and ability
to create a short film that pushes the boundaries of what a ‘student film’ can achieve, however, as you can imagine making a short film
isn’t easy and we could really use your help. 

How Can I Help? And What's In It For Me? 
Our project is already raising quite
the production value; as well as the traditional funds required such as paying
for cast and crew, transport, locations, props etc. Our project’s narrative
spans many years and features two huge set pieces that will require both
attention to detail in terms of practical effect, sound and most importantly,
health and safety. Some of what we hope to achieve such as make up and set
pieces have a clear but fine line between tacky and believable. It would be your
donations and support which would help us cross that line.
Every penny is appreciated, any
donations big or small will be met with a thank you! You can donate any figure, so even if you can only spare  £1 that's entirely fine, just use the donation box to the right to enter any custom figure. However, to show our
deep appreciation for your support, we’ve already offered various perks for
those who donate specific figures. We hope you enjoy them, and yes, they are entirely optional. The
perks are listed on this page, they include various methods of thanks, copies of the film and the
chance to become a producer. There’s also the super
embarrassing but hopefully worthwhile perk that will see our director, Conor, cover
a Taylor Swift song of your choice. We doubt any of you will donate that much,
but should you prove us wrong you will surely be rewarded! <3 – Points for improvisation...right?

Risks & Challenges
So if we have your curiosity so far, let us get your attention, - this is exactly where your money would be going should you choose to help us;

Set Pieces - We need to hire private land, build a fire, and ensure a safe working environment that allows our actors to interact with said fire. We have the land and the fire crew on stand by, it would be your money which makes it possible.
VHX, Practical Effects, - Our film will require a lot of extremely detailed practical effects which includes the burning of human skin, creating a demon, and successfully portraying what you see after your die. Your money will help us improve upon our practical effects but will also make the difference between our dying sequence being animated or (more ideally) practical. 
The Essentials - Essential in the true meaning of the word. Our film's sense of scope requires multiple actors, locations - methods of transport, accommodation, - your money will be used as salary and our means of procuring a wonderful set located in the Mourne Mountains. It will also allow for us to get our equipment and crew to this location.
Production Value - The more money we can raise, the better this allows us to make every frame and every scene as best as it can be; such as allowing us to hire different equipment for night shoots, and the implementation of an original score.
   But Why? What Happens After?  This is a project that we really believe in, and we'd like you you to believe in it too. It is the desire that after completion, this film can be entered into festivals and exhibits which we hope will have audience's asking questions on life and death. We really do hope to start a dialogue with our audience and we invite you to become a part of that dialogue with us.

    I'd Love To Help, but...
Hey, we get it, it's not a problem. Other than donating there are other methods in which you can help - and they'd be just as appreciated! It's as simple as getting the word out about our project, telling your friends, family, work-collegues and fellow film lovers. IndieGoGo even has some super neat share tools to help you do so. 
Lastly,
Thanks for taking the time to see what our project is all about. We really do want Damned in the Midst of Paradise to be the best film it can be, and your support will help us do that. If you place your confidence and well earned money in us, we'll be sure not to let you down. 
Thanks for your time, see you at the screening in May!

behalf of my dear friend Katya (Kathy) Lesher. </p>
<p>Every once in a while, if you’re lucky, you meet a person who
touches your life in a very deep and authentic way… a person whose great heart
and soulful spark helps you to see and feel yourself in a bigger way, and to heal, as well. Katya has
been such a person in my life. I know she has touched many others in that
way too.</p>
<p><b>February 1 is Katya's 52nd birthday. This campaign gives us a
chance to honor her for a life well lived, a life devoted in service to the
healing journeys of many people and to creating art that nourishes our hearts
and feed our souls.</b></p>
<p>As a working artist, Katya is in a transitional place in her own
life right now. Our support will help her to move into the next phase in a way
that will benefit many people.</p>
<p>The following words are Katya's, as she describes her journey,
her vision, and her wish for this birthday.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">_______________________</p>
<h3><b></b></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1185225/files/20150130142750-katya-moon.jpg?1422656870"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><h3><b><i>Katya's Life Journey </i></b></h3>
<p><b>I have always loved making art. It is an inner experience, a
form of meditation.</b> </p><p>When I am making art, I am in a place of not knowing – I begin,
and see what unfolds. This is similar to how I live my life – not knowing and
being open to the unfolding. Making art is healing – it opens me up, fills me
up….it nourishes me. It helps remind me to notice how things are in this
moment. <b>I want to walk through this world with my heart open, fully
awake, fully alive. Making art helps me remember this.</b></p>
<p>After working as a hospice social worker for 8 years, I felt
depleted and I yearned for time and energy to reconnect with my art. A year and
a half ago, I resigned from my position as hospice social worker, moved to New
Mexico, and took some time for healing and replenishing. </p>
<p>After a great deal of inner work and caring for myself, I am now
in a place to move outward and continue integrating my passions of making art,
guiding others with art as healing, and honoring the journeys of end-of-life
and grieving time. </p>
<p>As I discover more clarity about my life’s purpose, I recognize
there is not a path already laid out for me but rather I discover it as I go. <b>And
I would love your support on this journey!</b></p>
<h3><b><br/></b></h3><h3><b><i>Katya’s Vision</i></b></h3>
<p><b>I am honored to help others discover a path of healing and
transformation through creative expression and contemplative practice.</b> I am passionate
about opening hearts and minds in relationship to the dying time and the
importance of honoring this most sacred time, as well as honoring the grieving
time when a loved one dies.</p>
<p>Throughout my life I have had numerous opportunities to facilitate
creative expression retreats for children who experienced the death of a loved
one, as well as parents who experienced the death of a child. I witnessed art
as healing while I watched these children and parents weave together the loss,
sadness, memories, and gifts they received from the death of their loved ones,
and begin to move towards a place of wholeness.</p>
<p>Many years ago I volunteered with a non-profit organization for
at-risk youth, and witnessed the transformational power of creative expression.
I was inspired by their courage as they shared laughter and tears and their
stories via writing, drawing, photography and the spoken word. It was clear to
me that through creative expression, these young people were discovering parts
of themselves they had not met before.</p>
<p>We are all discovering our paths, we all have unique gifts to
offer, and none of us can do any of this alone… I am overflowing with ideas of
what I want to offer!</p>
<p><b>Currently I am working on several projects and, with your
support, I can bring these ideas into reality:</b></p>
<p>• <b>A series of note cards </b>featuring my
photos and haikus for those who are nearing end of life… to wish someone
well on their journey to the next realm; as well as note cards for care givers
and for those who are in their grieving time.<br/>
<br/>
We gift cards to people for all kinds of transitions – new baby, birthday,
graduation, wedding…and we send sympathy cards after a person dies. But so
often we have no vehicle to express our true feelings when someone we love is
in the process of dying. There is a gap here and these note cards are meant to help
fill that gap. <br/>
<br/>
The rite of passage at end-of-life is one of the most important times in a
person’s life – a part of a beautiful cycle we all share in common. Yet we
don’t typically acknowledge or celebrate with them – we have difficulty
honoring this very sacred time in a loved one’s life. My hope is to help others
to move towards awareness and acceptance of the fact that we all die and that
along with sadness and the missing, it is a time of celebration as well as a
letting go. <b>These note cards will provide the opportunity to celebrate
someone’s life and death, to let them know how much they are loved, and to wish
them a peaceful journey.</b></p>
<p><b>• Programs/retreats that will support people on their healing
journeys with creative expression. </b>I have already offered a one-day version
of this healing journey called “Roots and Wings” at my studio in Santa Fe. I
want to take time to develop more programs and retreats like this and reach out
to communities that will benefit from them.<b>  </b></p>
<p><b>• Honoring the artist within.</b> It is clear
to me that I thrive when I make art and that a huge part of me fades when I
don’t. I am better able to support others when I am able to spend time
creating.</p>
<h3><b><i>Katya's Birthday Wish</i></b></h3>
<p><i>In the end, though, maybe we must all give up <br/>
trying to pay back all the people in this world who sustain our lives. <br/>
In the end, it is wiser to surrender before the miraculous scope <br/>
of human generosity, and to just keep saying thank you, forever, <br/>
and sincerely, for as long as we have voices. </i></p>

<p><b>My work is a labor of love.</b> Your support will give me the
'gift of time' as I continue to find creative ways to do the work I am called
to do, along with generating an income so that I am able to take care of my
living expenses. </p>
<p>All gifts received are deeply appreciated, and I will keep
saying thank you, forever…</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">____________________</p>

<p>Our goal is to raise $3700 through this campaign, which will run
for 45 days starting on Katya's birthday. Your gift will help Katya in the
following ways:</p>
<p><b>· $1500 – Equipment:</b> This amount will
enable Katya to purchase a new computer and a good photo editing program so
that she can continue to create these note cards. (Her current computer is a
dinosaur and she's not sure how much longer it will hold up!)</p>
<p><b>· $1600  – Studio space:</b> This will cover
four months of studio rent while Katya continues to establish reliable sources
of income. Katya has a studio in Santa Fe where she creates her art as well as
hosts ""Roots and Wings"" workshops to support others in their inner
explorations and healing journeys. </p>
<p><b>· $600 – Professional Support:</b> This amount will
make it possible for Katya to consult with a business coach who has experience
in the art world and can help her find the appropriate business model so she
can financially sustain herself; and possibly also with an attorney regarding
copyright/trademark support.</p>

</h3>
<p>Hi! We're Richard Merrill and Susan Barrett Merrill, an artist couple from the tiny town of Brooksville in Downeast Maine (where the seasons are ""winter and six weeks of hard sleddin'""). We've been selected for a six-week art residency this winter
 at the <b><a href=""http://conservationfoundation.com/events-programs/events/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Conservation Foundation of the Gulf Coast</a> </b>in Osprey, Florida, south of Tampa. We will share our interest in and focus on the wildlife of the mid-Florida Gulf Coast 
landscape, our recognition that we are part of that landscape, and our 
commitment to living in harmony with it. The effects will reach far beyond Florida, supporting the creation of new work in the arts of puppetry and masks.<br/></p>
<p>Here is what it means
 to the Foundation (we added emphasis):</p>
<p>""<b>Access to natural spaces is critical to ensuring that creative people of
 our time and those in the future remain connected to the environment</b>. 
The Artist in Residence program of Conservation Foundation of the Gulf 
Coast makes that connection possible. Artists selected for the 
program are given extraordinary access to our bays, beaches and barrier 
islands. <b>Our hope is that their work will enhance appreciation for our 
coastal environment and broaden interest in the arts and conservation.</b>""</p>

<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p><b>Richard:</b> I'm a puppeteer and a member of Puppeteers of America. I
 recently won an arts visibility grant from the Maine Arts Commission to
 create an innovative wheelchair-based puppet theater which I use to 
perform with my shadow puppets, because an injury prevents me from 
standing or squatting for very long. The grant helped me revive my 
puppetry, which I dearly love and am excited to share. <br/></p>

I spin it, dye it with plants from my garden and my local area, so the essence of the plant life is imbued in the masks.

The masks you see above contain wool dyed with goldenrod, Japanese indigo from my garden, and the roots of the madder plant, which I grow in my garden.

</div></div>","Nature-based Arts Residency

Hi! We're Richard Merrill and Susan Barrett Merrill, an artist couple from the tiny town of Brooksville in Downeast Maine (where the seasons are ""winter and six weeks of hard sleddin'""). We've been selected for a six-week art residency this winter
 at the Conservation Foundation of the Gulf Coast in Osprey, Florida, south of Tampa. We will share our interest in and focus on the wildlife of the mid-Florida Gulf Coast 
landscape, our recognition that we are part of that landscape, and our 
commitment to living in harmony with it. The effects will reach far beyond Florida, supporting the creation of new work in the arts of puppetry and masks.
Here is what it means
 to the Foundation (we added emphasis):
""Access to natural spaces is critical to ensuring that creative people of
 our time and those in the future remain connected to the environment. 
The Artist in Residence program of Conservation Foundation of the Gulf 
Coast makes that connection possible. Artists selected for the 
program are given extraordinary access to our bays, beaches and barrier 
islands. Our hope is that their work will enhance appreciation for our 
coastal environment and broaden interest in the arts and conservation.""

Who we are
Richard: I'm a puppeteer and a member of Puppeteers of America. I
 recently won an arts visibility grant from the Maine Arts Commission to
 create an innovative wheelchair-based puppet theater which I use to 
perform with my shadow puppets, because an injury prevents me from 
standing or squatting for very long. The grant helped me revive my 
puppetry, which I dearly love and am excited to share. 


Above is a video demonstrating the mobility of Richard's wheelchair- based puppet theater, funded in part by an Arts Visibility grant from the Maine Arts Commission.


My puppets have been exhibited in museums and galleries, and I have presented at Sharing the Fire, the national storytelling conference.My great grandmother was Haudenosaunee (Iroquois), and I am working on a play for shadow puppets of the Haudenosaunee story ""How the Birds Got Their Songs."" Above, the Creator's feet are walking through the world. Below are two views of the hero of the story, Chih'neh the Hermit Thrush. The designs are traditional Haudenosaunee motifs.
I cut them from 6-ply Bristol board with knives and wood chisels, or use knives to cut them from aluminum sheet. They are articulated for graceful and beautiful movement.In Florida, I will teach a shadow puppet-making class based on the Seminole story of creation of the animals, and a class on the making of bird 
kites based on local Gulf Coast species.You can also see some of my puppets from another Native American story, The Legend of Jumping Mouse, at my puppet website. These and others were exhibited for four months at the Farnsworth Art Museum in Rockland, Maine.


Susan: I weave three-dimensional masks from wool I help shear on an island off the Maine coast. I spin it, dye it with plants from my garden and my local area, so the essence of the plant life is imbued in the masks. The method for weaving them came to me in a dream, and to me the characters speak for the Earth. The masks you see above contain wool dyed with goldenrod, Japanese indigo from my garden, and the roots of the madder plant, which I grow in my garden. The faces are felted onto headdresses, and embellished with small people, designs, and decorative details.

Here I am shaping a mask face after taking it off the loom. The photo is by Paola Gianturco.My masks are in private collections, have seen exhibition and performance in Sarajevo and Tblisi, Georgia, and have been in galleries in the US and abroad. Two masks are in the permanent collection of the City of Chieri, Italy, an ancient weaving city where blue denim originated. Visit my mask web site
I will be creating new work incorporating natural materials from the Florida landscape, teach weaving and primitive 
methods of spinning, and help local residents and visitors create 
community weavings on a large free-standing EarthLoom - a loom I 
originated. 

Above is a community EarthLoom at a school in Maine. Children are lined up to weave in colorful materials, grasses, and their wishes for a better world written on ribbons of birch bark. My husband Richard and I are the founders of the EarthLoom Foundation, which supports the creation of EarthLooms everywhere, and training on how to make EarthLoom projects most effective for your community.
  We would LOVE your help!

<h2><strong>My Story</strong></h2>
<p>Hi, my name is <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/AquarianArt"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Vincent Stout</a>. I am an aspiring professional photographer here in Omaha Nebraksa and am stuck in a bit of a rut. I wish to finish my photography school here at a local Omaha college and start making a career out of my passion! However, this is only possible with a professional <a href=""http://imaging.nikon.com/lineup/dslr/d7000/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">camera</a> of my own! Borrowing my friends camera just won't cut it in the real world I'm affraid. To get what I need, I need money, to get money I need jobs, to get jobs I need my own camera. You see this is where you, the people of the internet come in! I have a long way to go; this level of equipment is expensive, but the result will be reflected in the creative depth and excellence that I could not achieve without it. I strive stay competitive and give the world the very best high quality images I can, and I need your help to get me there.</p>
<h2>For the Love of the Shot</h2>
<p>Every little bit helps my friends. Every penny that you give will go straight towards a new camera to call my own, to help me finish my school, and start my dreams. I have been longing for my opportunity to make my passion into my career, and I am ready with the skill, the vision, and the creativity to kickstart the rest of my life; I just need the right tools. And that is where all of you come in my friends.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>I need $3,000 dollars which will go straight towards to goals I mentioned above. If I dont reach this goal by October 15th of 2012, every spare cent I make will be saved to help me eventually make my dreams happen. <strong>For your generous donations, </strong>even the smallest amounts, I will be offering gifts at the end of the campaign! But even if you do not have any thing to give, sharing my <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/AquarianArt"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">imagery </a>with your friends and family is more than I could even ask for.</p>

<h3>What this means to me?<br/>
</h3>    So in case you didn’t know, im most passionate about two things:
dancing and my gays. This exhibition combines both. I need your help to make it

love with everything about the ballroom community and want to share their stories.
Help a queen out and donate… anything helps.

</h3><p><b>	Kansas
Free For Arts </b>will be held annually in Emporia, Kansas on
Commercial Street and the surrounding downtown area. The festival
will feature five sound stages of varying sizes on which 15 bands
ranging from nationally touring headliners to buzzing local artists
as well as Kansas music students of all ages will perform. The event
will also be host to a wide variety of visual artists, including
Kansas art students, who will be showcasing their art at various
booths and tents located on the festival's pedestrian walkways.
Professional artists and musicians, along with wellness
professionals, will also be leading educational workshops and
demonstrations at designated sites in the festival. This all-ages
festival is to be <b>absolutely free to the public!!! </b>The
mission of <b>Kansas Free For Arts </b>is
to enrich the lives of Kansans through advocacy for wellness,
education and stimulating arts culture.</p><p>I am undertaking this massive project for a couple of reasons. For starters, I am a lifelong lover of art as well as a professional musician. As a professional musician, I am privileged to earn a living by sharing what I love with other people in a meaningful way. The reason that I am lucky enough to enjoy such a privilege is because the experiences I had as a youngster with both music education, and live performances touched me so deeply that they would inspire me to become dedicated to the path of excellence in music performance. Because music and art have enriched my life so much, I think it's only fair to give back what I can and to provide for the rest of the world (or at least my fellow Kansans) some of those same experiences that profoundly changed my life for the better.</p><p><br/></p><p>The second main reason I endeavor to produce this festival is my love for my community and my State. Producing this caliber of an event will benefit both Emporia and Kansas as a whole in numerous ways. Of course, there's the intrinsic value that is felt both by individuals' subjective experience as well as the collective experience of community participation. Research suggests that live music and art increases individuals' self-esteem and outlook on the world at large. Naturally, If the individual members of a community have a high self-esteem and an overall positive outlook, then it follows that the community itself will be known for its positive disposition.

	Kansas
Free For Arts will be held annually in Emporia, Kansas on
Commercial Street and the surrounding downtown area. The festival
will feature five sound stages of varying sizes on which 15 bands
ranging from nationally touring headliners to buzzing local artists
as well as Kansas music students of all ages will perform. The event
will also be host to a wide variety of visual artists, including
Kansas art students, who will be showcasing their art at various
booths and tents located on the festival's pedestrian walkways.
Professional artists and musicians, along with wellness
professionals, will also be leading educational workshops and
demonstrations at designated sites in the festival. This all-ages
festival is to be absolutely free to the public!!! The
mission of Kansas Free For Arts is
to enrich the lives of Kansans through advocacy for wellness,
education and stimulating arts culture.I am undertaking this massive project for a couple of reasons. For starters, I am a lifelong lover of art as well as a professional musician. As a professional musician, I am privileged to earn a living by sharing what I love with other people in a meaningful way. The reason that I am lucky enough to enjoy such a privilege is because the experiences I had as a youngster with both music education, and live performances touched me so deeply that they would inspire me to become dedicated to the path of excellence in music performance. Because music and art have enriched my life so much, I think it's only fair to give back what I can and to provide for the rest of the world (or at least my fellow Kansans) some of those same experiences that profoundly changed my life for the better.The second main reason I endeavor to produce this festival is my love for my community and my State. Producing this caliber of an event will benefit both Emporia and Kansas as a whole in numerous ways. Of course, there's the intrinsic value that is felt both by individuals' subjective experience as well as the collective experience of community participation. Research suggests that live music and art increases individuals' self-esteem and outlook on the world at large. Naturally, If the individual members of a community have a high self-esteem and an overall positive outlook, then it follows that the community itself will be known for its positive disposition. Aside from increasing personal and social well-being, Kansas Fee For Arts will also boost the local economy. A festival of this size is likely to draw audiences from as far away as 300 miles as well as a large portion of the local population. The influx of downtown foot traffic will guarantee merchants abnormally high sales for the afternoon. This event could also potentially attract more interest into the market in general, and not just during the festival itself.In order to get the ball rolling I first need to register Kansas Free For arts as a corporation with the State of Kansas as well as file for tax exempt status with the IRS. As soon as that is complete, KFFA will officially be a Non-Profit Organization and can begin the process of fundraising for the festival.That's where you come in...Although this initial campaign is only for the costs involved with business startup ($2,000), Kansas Free For Arts has a first year budget of $200,000 to bring to you one of the finest music and art experiences in the Midwest.

RETURN TO INDIEGOGO
Last year BRAVO FX lead a relatively productive indiegogo
campaign raising funds towards a practical special effect shop equipped with materials and
equipment to make the impossible, commonplace. While I didn’t hit my goal, I’m
happy to report that in the months following BravoFx’s  gogo experience I’ve been able to bring
my monsters and madness to more then half a dozen film and new media projects. 
 Practical special effects is a particularly complex art form. I am completely self taught, and while it’s true I am incredibly proud of
the work I’ve done thus far, I know how much more I could offer the indie film
community if I only had a stronger foundation. Thus bringing us to the point, I
want to study at the “Stan Winston School Of Character Arts” a internet
based school taught by the industries top minds.
WHAT
IS BRAVO FX?
 BRAVO F.X. is the early
stages of a special effects house owned and operated by indie film producer

practical effects to film makers whom would in many cases be unable to achieve
there vision. BRAVO F.X. caters to the little guy, because that’s where it all
started for me. Simply put the goal is to grant up and coming filmmakers the
tools I never had while doing something I love.
What is the Stan Winston School Of Character ArtsWhy Give???

The
whole idea behind starting BRAVO FX was to bring blockbuster special effects to
the up and coming filmmaker,  It is
my personal opinion that the entertainment industries newest minds are often
the most passionate, but sadly the least armed to bring there vision to life.
Simply put; the less personal expense and debt I am able to put into BRAVO FX
the lower I can keep my prices.

WHAT AM I USING THE FUNDS FOR?
All funds raised go towards furthering my training in the fields of practical special effects via the Stan Winston School Of Character Arts. this would include Advance Character make up, cable mechanism basics, hairing, the basics of animatronics, and most importantly the ability to improvise. (Such as when last moment changes are requested by the production team and or cast.)Specifics include

How in reality fathom to the world about which we know almost nothing?</p><p> </p><p>There were so many questions that I have to answer for myself to get started.</p><p> </p><p>And it started .... we founded the collector group... traitors for stories ...</p><p>and we found out ... we grew up with the exhibits and experiences that started coming ...</p><p> </p><p>.. what is a feeling to see after blindness ... to walk, to see and to speak after awakening from coma ... what is a feeling to get a call from God and to become a priest ... to successfully split the siam twins after 15 hours of severe surgery, to perform an amazing venture ... and hold one baby as a mother and as daddy another …</p><p>And that is why I want to tell you stories that no one knows, to convey to you a message about the world we live in, through the impression of the moment in which they happened, through the uniqueness of the people and their moments in which they were created ...</p><p>And that is why I want to tell you stories that no one knows, to convey to you a message about the world we live in, through the impression of the moment in which they happened, through the uniqueness of the people and their moments in which they were created ...</p><p>This is the desire which this museum was created.</p><p>How did you feel and what exactly happened at one particular moment, what were the processes that were happening in you, emotions, thoughts through which you were passing ... Do you have a message for this world ... Do you carry inspiration from an event that happened inside you ... Can you bring somebody deep view in your world in that moment ... tell him ...</p><p>Have you assembled your existence at this point, wonder whether you have understood something extraordinary, something incredible at this point, whether this is what your life makes unique, giving it the purpose of putting you in the dimension of the new existence.</p><p><strong>My wish is to convey to the world your unique experience through which you have passed ... this is the purpose of this museum</strong></p><p>...... Why?</p><p>Many ask ...</p><p>Why is this important, who will be interested of this?</p><p>The answer is not simple, it is drawn from the sole purpose of reaching immersion in unforgettable and unique moments, to unite the life...</p><p><strong>I want others to feel  each others, that's the purpose.</strong></p><p>I want people to be given each others, through knowledge of their life, that particularity that has happened to them.</p><p>I want others to feel the shape of there soul through which they have passed.</p><p>I want people to meet ... and to learn something new ...</p><p>This is perhaps the only possible answer to the question asked ... Why? ...</p><p>The fullness of the answers will always get everyone for themselves ... through this museum.</p><p>People talk very little about themselves. Little, they hand over their special and inspired moments to each other.</p><p>They keep their messages of life for themselves, thinking that no one would be interested.</p><p>On the other hand, it is very important to divide them, transfer them to others and learn and teach each other ...</p><p>Sometimes I think it would be easier to create a car accident museum than a museum of unforgettable moments.</p><p>Because you simply ... put the data up, you do it in some sense and that is it - we all can - we mean it, but we used to get used to ""getting sick"" in bad luck and through the media and the yellow press. .</p><p>But ... the uniqueness of this museum is in its uniqueness, the depth of search for the stories we have brought in the depths of unknown and unbelievable details of the life we ​​have found ...</p><p>The specialty of this museum is that through it we can teach each other how to be closer to each other.</p><p>We can meet someone's incredible and unique moments ... we can see someone's message ... we can have a richer experience ...</p><p><strong>Enrich yourself with others.</strong></p><p>This is the first museum to bring you incredible world experiences ...</p><p>THIS IS THE CREATION OF HUMAN FEELINGS, EMOTION, AND THE SITUATION THROUGH THE PEOPLE IN A PARTICULAR NOMENT ...

I'm sure you got it.Something special, because we are all special ...What does make you, what makes your message to the world? What is your experience that can be captivated and touch something unreal? Tell us,let us know ... write from bottom of your heart ...... this was the first thought of creating this museum …The desire, which was born at that moment, was to present to the world special moments of the life around us.... How in reality fathom to the world about which we know almost nothing? There were so many questions that I have to answer for myself to get started. And it started .... we founded the collector group... traitors for stories ...and we found out ... we grew up with the exhibits and experiences that started coming ... .. what is a feeling to see after blindness ... to walk, to see and to speak after awakening from coma ... what is a feeling to get a call from God and to become a priest ... to successfully split the siam twins after 15 hours of severe surgery, to perform an amazing venture ... and hold one baby as a mother and as daddy another …And that is why I want to tell you stories that no one knows, to convey to you a message about the world we live in, through the impression of the moment in which they happened, through the uniqueness of the people and their moments in which they were created ...And that is why I want to tell you stories that no one knows, to convey to you a message about the world we live in, through the impression of the moment in which they happened, through the uniqueness of the people and their moments in which they were created ...This is the desire which this museum was created.How did you feel and what exactly happened at one particular moment, what were the processes that were happening in you, emotions, thoughts through which you were passing ... Do you have a message for this world ... Do you carry inspiration from an event that happened inside you ... Can you bring somebody deep view in your world in that moment ... tell him ...Have you assembled your existence at this point, wonder whether you have understood something extraordinary, something incredible at this point, whether this is what your life makes unique, giving it the purpose of putting you in the dimension of the new existence.My wish is to convey to the world your unique experience through which you have passed ... this is the purpose of this museum...... Why?Many ask ...Why is this important, who will be interested of this?The answer is not simple, it is drawn from the sole purpose of reaching immersion in unforgettable and unique moments, to unite the life...I want others to feel  each others, that's the purpose.I want people to be given each others, through knowledge of their life, that particularity that has happened to them.I want others to feel the shape of there soul through which they have passed.I want people to meet ... and to learn something new ...This is perhaps the only possible answer to the question asked ... Why? ...The fullness of the answers will always get everyone for themselves ... through this museum.People talk very little about themselves. Little, they hand over their special and inspired moments to each other.They keep their messages of life for themselves, thinking that no one would be interested.On the other hand, it is very important to divide them, transfer them to others and learn and teach each other ...Sometimes I think it would be easier to create a car accident museum than a museum of unforgettable moments.Because you simply ... put the data up, you do it in some sense and that is it - we all can - we mean it, but we used to get used to ""getting sick"" in bad luck and through the media and the yellow press. .But ... the uniqueness of this museum is in its uniqueness, the depth of search for the stories we have brought in the depths of unknown and unbelievable details of the life we ​​have found ...The specialty of this museum is that through it we can teach each other how to be closer to each other.We can meet someone's incredible and unique moments ... we can see someone's message ... we can have a richer experience ...Enrich yourself with others.This is the first museum to bring you incredible world experiences ...THIS IS THE CREATION OF HUMAN FEELINGS, EMOTION, AND THE SITUATION THROUGH THE PEOPLE IN A PARTICULAR NOMENT ... IN THEIR INCOMPATIBLE, UNIQUE, AND UNFORGETTABLE LIVING ...And do not forget ... there are no ordinary moments in life, there is only the experience of that moment.To go to Bali is in some cases many times less inspiring than sit on the roadside with a beloved person in the deaf night and experience the most lively moments of your life.So...!What's your story?Please tell me your story ....I'm sure you got it.Something special, because we are all special ...(: You can send your story: mystory@moum-zagreb.com :) LOOK INTO THE UNDISCOVERED WORLDWe are building this museum to encourage each other to feel.This is a museumwith a message. The concept of the museum was created to celebrate the beauty of living ...OUTSTANDING PEOPLE ... FULL OF HINTS ...VALUABLE EXPERIENCES ABOUT VALUE OF LIFE ...Feel it through this museum ...THIS IS  THE MUSEUM OFUNFORGETTABLE MOMENTSWe want you to feel other people’s experiences, but also to share your experience, to your friends, loved ones, family ...

MUZEJ LJUDI OKO VAS I NJIHOVIH  POSEBNIH TRENUTAKA KOJI ĆE VAM OTVORITI VRATA NADAHNUĆA Molim te reci mi svoju priču.Koja je tvoja priča? Siguran sam da ju imaš. Nešto posebno, jer svi smo mi posebni...Što je to što čini tebe, što te sačinjava u tvojoj poruci svijetu? Koje je tvoje iskustvo iz kojeg se može uhvatiti neuhvatljivo i dodirnuti nestvarno? Reci nam, ispričaj nam... izreci nam svoju dubinu...... bile su to prve misli stvaranja ovog muzeja...Želja koja se rodila u tom trenu bila je da se svijetu predoče posebni trenuci svijeta oko nas....Kako u stvarnosti doći do tog svijeta o kojem ne znamo skoro ništa ?Kako nekoga upitati da nam ispriča svoju nezaboravnu priču ?Bilo je tu jako puno pitanja na koja sam sebi morao odgovoriti kako bi sve to započeo.I krenulo je.... oformila se sakupljačka grupa... tragaoci za pričama... i saznali smo... rasli smo uz eksponate i doživljaje koji su počeli pristizati...... kakav je osjećaj progledati nakon sljepoće... prohodati, progledati i progovoriti nakon buđenja iz kome...kakav je osjećaj dobiti poziv od Boga i zarediti se... uspješno razdvojiti sijamske blizanke nakon 15 sati teške operacije, izvesti nevjerojatan pothvat... a kao mama držati u naručju jednu bebu a tata drugu...I zato Vam želim ispričati priče koje nitko ne zna, prenijeti Vam ih porukom o svijetu u kojem živimo, kroz impresiju trenutka u kojem su se dogodile, kroz jedinstvenost ljudi i njihovih trenutaka u kojima su nastale...To je želja s kojom se stvorio ovaj muzej.Kako ste se osjećali i što se točno dogodiloo u jednom posebnom trenutku, koji su se procesi odvijali tada u vama, emocije, misli kroz koje ste prolazili...Da li imate poruku za ovaj svijet... Da li nosite nadahnuće iz događaja koji vam se dogodio... Možete li nekome donijeti uvid u vaš svijet kroz taj trenutak... poručiti mu...Jeste li sabrali svoje postojanje u tom trenu, zapitali se, jeste li u toj točci događanja shvatili nešto posebno, nešto nevjerojatno, da li je to baš ono što vaš život čini jedinstvenim, daje mu svrhu koja vas je uzdigla u dimenzije novog postojanja.Želja nam je prenijeti Svijetu vaše jedinstveno iskustvo kroz koje ste prošli... to je svrha ovog muzeja...... Zašto?Pitaju se mnogi...Zašto je to važno, koga će to interesirati?Odgovor nije jednostavan, izvučen je iz same svrhe da se dosegne uranjanje u nezaboravne i jedinstvene trenutke, da se objedini cjelina proživljenoga...Želimo da drugi osjete druge, to je svrha.Želimo da ljudi pruže drugima, kroz znanje o njihovom životu, tu posebnost koja im se desila.Želimo da drugi osjete stanje kroz koje su prošli.Želimo da se ljudi upoznaju... i da nauče nešto novo...To je možda jedini i moguć odgovor na postavljeno pitanje... Zašto?...Potpunost odgovora će ionako dobiti svatko za sebe... kroz ovaj muzej.Ljudi jako malo pričaju o sebi. Malo, zapravo pre malo prenose svoje posebne i nadahnute trenutke jedni drugima.Svoje poruke o životu čuvaju za sebe misleć da nikog ne bi interesirale.S druge pak strane jako je bitno da ih podijele, prenesu drugima i da nauče i poduče jedni druge...Ponekad razmišljam kako bi bilo jednostavnije stvoriti muzej automobilskih nesreća nego muzej nezaboravnih trenutaka.Jer jednostavno... prepišeš podatke, posložiš ih po nekom smislu... to svi možemo... to mi mislimo, ali i navikli smo se ""kupati"" u nesrećama i lošem, putem medija i žutog tiska...Ali... bit i posebnost ovog muzeja je u njegovoj jedinstvenosti, dubini, potrage za pričama koje smo donijeli, u dubini nepoznatih i nevjerojatnih detalja iz života koje smo pronašli ...Posebnost ovog muzeja je da kroz njega možemo naučiti jedni druge kako biti bliže jedni drugima.Možemo upoznati nečije nevjerojatne i jedinstvene trenutke... možemo uvidjeti nečiju poruku... možemo biti bogatiji iskustvom...Obogatite se drugima.Ovo je prvi muzej koji Vam donosi nevjerojatna iskustva svijeta...OVO JE ZBIRKA LJUDSKIH OSJEĆAJA, EMOCIJA I STANJA KROZ KOJA SU PROLAZILI LJUDI U ODREĐENOM TRENUTKU... U NJIHOVOM NEPONOVLJIVOM, JEDINSTVENOM I NEZABORAVNOM ŽIVOTU...I ne zaboravite... u životu ne postoje obični trenuci, postoji isključivo doživljaj tog trenutaka.Ići na Bali je u nekim slučajevima mnogo puta praznije nego recimo sjediti na rubnjaku ceste s voljenom osobom u gluho doba noći i doživljavati najdivnije trenutke svojeg života.I... !Koja je tvoja priča?Molim te reci mi svoju priču....Siguran sam da ju imaš.Nešto posebno, jer svi smo mi posebni...(: Možete poslati svoju priču: mystory@moum-zagreb.com :) POGLEDAJTE U NEOTKRIVENI SVIJETGradimo ovaj muzej kako bi potaknuli jedni druge na osjećaje.Ovo je muzej s porukomKoncept muzeja je stvoren u čast ljepote življenja ...NEVJEROJATNIH LJUDI ... PREPUN SAVJETA ... KORISNIH ISKUSTAVA O VRIJEDNOSTI ŽIVOTA Osjetimo to kroz ovaj muzej ...  OVO JE MUZEJNEZABORAVNIH TRENUTAKAŽelja nam je da osjetite tuđa iskustva, ali da i vi pružite svoje iskustvo, svojim prijateljima, najmilijima, obitelji ... Želja nam je da vas potaknemo da i vi naučite druge, da im pružite iskustvo koje ste stekli. Neka vam Muzej Nezaboravnih Trenutaka bude primjer kroz iskustva na koja ćete naići.

Pronašli smo prostor u samom centru Zagreba koji svojim obimom i zahtjevnošću nudi najbolje do sada. Prostor je velik i razdijeljen na sekvence koje nam najbolje odgovaraju.

<p>Hello Friends! Thanks for checking out my campaign! I'm Shiva - a writer, artist, organizer, and Satanist. This year, I released my first book - <a href=""https://www.serpentinae.com/the-devils-tome"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Devil's Tome: A Book of Modern Satanic Ritual</a>. I was overwhelmed and encouraged by the support it received and the explosion of interest around ritual practice. Its success has inspired me to create a companion piece to the book that can help users tune into their inner knowledge and power -<i> The Devil's Deck.</i></p>
<p>Tarot and oracle decks have played an important part in my Satanic journey. They were a gateway to the occult for me and played a huge part in my personal liberation. Of all my ritual tools my decks are probably employed the most - they have an uncanny way of bringing to surface desires and inner-knowledge we often ignore.</p>
<p>My love of the cards inspired me to create The Devil's Deck - the first deck of its kind. The Devil's Deck is a 30 card ritual deck that is a companion to my book The Devil's Tome and is illustrated by Satanic Temple co-founder Lucien Greaves, The Devil's Tome illustrator Lex Corey, and myself.</p>

</div></div>","Hello Friends! Thanks for checking out my campaign! I'm Shiva - a writer, artist, organizer, and Satanist. This year, I released my first book - The Devil's Tome: A Book of Modern Satanic Ritual. I was overwhelmed and encouraged by the support it received and the explosion of interest around ritual practice. Its success has inspired me to create a companion piece to the book that can help users tune into their inner knowledge and power - The Devil's Deck.
Tarot and oracle decks have played an important part in my Satanic journey. They were a gateway to the occult for me and played a huge part in my personal liberation. Of all my ritual tools my decks are probably employed the most - they have an uncanny way of bringing to surface desires and inner-knowledge we often ignore.
My love of the cards inspired me to create The Devil's Deck - the first deck of its kind. The Devil's Deck is a 30 card ritual deck that is a companion to my book The Devil's Tome and is illustrated by Satanic Temple co-founder Lucien Greaves, The Devil's Tome illustrator Lex Corey, and myself.
 

 

The Devil's Deck is a tool that can be used to sharpen inner knowledge, aid in healing, and deepen personal power. This printing is limited to 666 hand-numbered and signed copies. I designed the deck to serve as a ritual tool and sacred art piece.

 
The Devil's Deck, like The Devil's Tome, will be gilded. The deck, booklet, and card box will all be a heavy matte print illuminated with gold foil.

The Sight sigil - the symbol from The Devil's Tome that represents vision and insight - will be applied with gold foil on the back of each card in the deck and each card will have gilded edges. The 30 cards will come in a heavy two-piece matte black and gold-foiled box and be accompanied by a matte black softcover guide book with gold foiling. This accompanying booklet will be over 30 pages and discuss the reflections for each card and its associated ritual, act of empowerment, or introspection.

Stretch Goal 1 - Unlocked!
We hit $20,000 - now all decks will have gilded card edges!
 
 
 
 
The Devil's Deck Companions
I've created special items to accompany the deck and put together a number of enchanting packages to support the project. All Visions level pledges and above will include an altar cloth, ritual deck bag, and handmade incense made specially for The Devil's Deck

The Devil's Deck altar cloth can be a lovely addition to your practice. The altar cloth is 21x21 inches and will be printed with metallic gold ink. It's decorated with The Sight sigil, representing your inner guidance and vision.

Ritual Incense

Over the last year I've created a collection of handmade ritual incense for my site Serpentīnae. I'll create an new incense for use with The Devil's Deck. All Visions Packages and above will include a bag of 20 incense.

The Devil's Tome + Devil's Deck Prints

I've put together packages that feature illustrations from Lucien Greaves and Alexander Corey. Each 8x10 print edition is limited to an edition of 30 and is signed and numbered by the artist. The prints are available in the Print packages, The 666 Packages, and The Baphomet Package. 
Additionally, The Baphomet Package contains an original piece of artwork from Alexander Corey.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to read our fundraising proposal, we are excited to announce that we have been accepted to bring a one-of-a-kind experience to the LoveBurn festival in Miami! <strong>This campaign is to raise funds to produce an Interactive Art Installation called ""Doorways to the Multiverse.""

<p>The LoveBurn is a magical happening where participants gather to experience one main aspect of life, their uttermost freedom! At the Loveburn you can express yourself freely and meet others on the same journey. The yearly festival features an eclectic assortment of art, music, and interactive activities that you will keep in your memories for years to come. In truth, this isn't a really good description for the LoveBurn. It is much more than that. It is a place to connect, to explore, to dance, and discover a world outside of time. (<a href=""http://theloveburn.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Find out more about theloveburn.org here.</a>)</p>
<p>The Loveburn is a regional slice of the greater Burning Man Festival community. Burners pride themselves in bringing some of the best most breathtaking art pieces to life. They do so by following the 10 Principles of Burning Man, one of which brings everything together, ""Participation"". <strong>Everyone is bringing something to the table or is able to contribute in a different way. This year, my team and I are bringing a new installation to the Playa. </strong>Moreover, we are shooting to create this piece to reach the main event in September, and would like to Debut first at the LoveBurn! Your donation will go to cover the costs of this art piece, transportation, storage, materials, maintenance, and preservation. Be part of this awesome production, make a contribution today!</p>
<p><strong>About the Artwork:</strong></p>
<p><strong>""Doorways to the Multiverse""</strong></p>
<p>Imagine encountering a door... You walk closer and on this door, there is a mirror. You see your face covered in dust. It's you. Or at least a version of you, one on a journey. <br/>You notice a doorknob. Intuitively, you open the door and walk-in. You are now entering through a portal... <br/>Across from you, you see another door with yet another mirror. A sign above it tells you, ""Close the door behind you"". You do, and discover you are now between two mirrors. Both doors reflect each other with infinite reflections, and you see yourself and the multiverse within you. The many, replica, repeating infinitely, symbolizing your true essence, your infinite self. You open the next door and close it behind you, only to see pieces of different sized mirrors. Each reflecting a different perspective. </p>
<p><br/>""Doorways to the Multiverse"" makes the participant part of the art and enter literal portals into the multiverse. </p>
<p>Whether alone or with friends, people will able to get a good look at who they are, how they look and allow for deep realizations. Their personas, costumes, and masks will be visible to them at the perfect part of their journey.<br/><br/>This piece supports the theme of Burning Man this year (the Multiverse) and makes for a physical representation of the infinity of the multiverse and its different layers, all starting with your individual perspective. <br/><br/><strong>What is the philosophy of this piece?</strong><br/>Reflection. When you get to see yourself in the mirror, you get to know yourself better. You have the opportunity to have a conversation with yourself. You have the opportunity to take care of yourself, whether it is grooming, or emotional maintenance. This piece gives you a quick look. The reason it is perfect for the playa is because it lets you see the landscape from a totally new vantage point, with you in it. I see it has a momentary portrait of your time in the playa. How do we connect to a multiverse that we can't see? We make it visible, we make it interactive, we give the people a chance to experience themselves being infinite, with something so simple, that they'll be able to remember it every time they go in between two mirrors.</p>
<p><strong>About the Artist:</strong></p>
<p>Riko Chirito is a Miami based artist and producer. He's been creating experiences and events for the community involving artists and creatives. In 2015 he started a non-profit called Waking Hearts, where he organized hundreds of local artists to perform, showcase, and present their art forms in community grassroots events. After this project, Riko moved into the healing arts space, where he has been practicing to master the art of Thai Vedic Healing. Since then, he's organized workshops and lectures at festivals like Burning Man, LoveBurn and Tribal Gathering. This project will be his return to the art world, for more art to come. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need funds to cover the costs of the art piece and to get it to both Burns. This includes, materials, labor, tools, storage, maintenance, troubleshooting, insurance, and secure transportation.</p>
<p>As you know, you will be contributing to this art piece as a Patron of the Arts. If you haven't donated to the production of an art piece, this is a good place to start.</p>
<p>For all donations of $50 or more I will carve or laser imprint your name on the piece, you as a Patron. So yes your name will be immortalized and taken to the playa for years to come!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Here's an excerpt of what this art piece represents:</p>
<p>Found in the desert, two decorated and fully-functional doors are furnished with mirrors on both sides. They face each other and provide a perspective into both of the participants' outer and inner self. These reflections allow for a real-life experience of the infinity that is the multiverse. </p>
<p>""This project will be my debut as an artist at a large festival. I have organized artists for years to exhibit art at events produced by me, this time around, I am designing this piece and ensuring it's presented at these two burns! I can't do it alone, I need the help of the community. As an incentive, if this piece ever sells, I will use the money to revive my non-profit and continue to support artists in our communities."" - Riko Chirito</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are taking the risks of paying for the work out of pocket, and we are raising funds to expand on the quality of the design. Right now our budget only permits us to do a very simple, rather flimsy version of it, with your help we will be able to create a strong and stable piece ready to take on the challenges of being an outside interactive piece.</p>

Short Summary
Thank you for taking the time to read our fundraising proposal, we are excited to announce that we have been accepted to bring a one-of-a-kind experience to the LoveBurn festival in Miami! This campaign is to raise funds to produce an Interactive Art Installation called ""Doorways to the Multiverse."" Your contribution will help us bring this sculpture to the beach! Read on for more details!
The LoveBurn is a magical happening where participants gather to experience one main aspect of life, their uttermost freedom! At the Loveburn you can express yourself freely and meet others on the same journey. The yearly festival features an eclectic assortment of art, music, and interactive activities that you will keep in your memories for years to come. In truth, this isn't a really good description for the LoveBurn. It is much more than that. It is a place to connect, to explore, to dance, and discover a world outside of time. (Find out more about theloveburn.org here.)
The Loveburn is a regional slice of the greater Burning Man Festival community. Burners pride themselves in bringing some of the best most breathtaking art pieces to life. They do so by following the 10 Principles of Burning Man, one of which brings everything together, ""Participation"". Everyone is bringing something to the table or is able to contribute in a different way. This year, my team and I are bringing a new installation to the Playa. Moreover, we are shooting to create this piece to reach the main event in September, and would like to Debut first at the LoveBurn! Your donation will go to cover the costs of this art piece, transportation, storage, materials, maintenance, and preservation. Be part of this awesome production, make a contribution today!
About the Artwork:
""Doorways to the Multiverse""
Imagine encountering a door... You walk closer and on this door, there is a mirror. You see your face covered in dust. It's you. Or at least a version of you, one on a journey. You notice a doorknob. Intuitively, you open the door and walk-in. You are now entering through a portal... Across from you, you see another door with yet another mirror. A sign above it tells you, ""Close the door behind you"". You do, and discover you are now between two mirrors. Both doors reflect each other with infinite reflections, and you see yourself and the multiverse within you. The many, replica, repeating infinitely, symbolizing your true essence, your infinite self. You open the next door and close it behind you, only to see pieces of different sized mirrors. Each reflecting a different perspective. 
""Doorways to the Multiverse"" makes the participant part of the art and enter literal portals into the multiverse. 
Whether alone or with friends, people will able to get a good look at who they are, how they look and allow for deep realizations. Their personas, costumes, and masks will be visible to them at the perfect part of their journey.This piece supports the theme of Burning Man this year (the Multiverse) and makes for a physical representation of the infinity of the multiverse and its different layers, all starting with your individual perspective. What is the philosophy of this piece?Reflection. When you get to see yourself in the mirror, you get to know yourself better. You have the opportunity to have a conversation with yourself. You have the opportunity to take care of yourself, whether it is grooming, or emotional maintenance. This piece gives you a quick look. The reason it is perfect for the playa is because it lets you see the landscape from a totally new vantage point, with you in it. I see it has a momentary portrait of your time in the playa. How do we connect to a multiverse that we can't see? We make it visible, we make it interactive, we give the people a chance to experience themselves being infinite, with something so simple, that they'll be able to remember it every time they go in between two mirrors.
About the Artist:
Riko Chirito is a Miami based artist and producer. He's been creating experiences and events for the community involving artists and creatives. In 2015 he started a non-profit called Waking Hearts, where he organized hundreds of local artists to perform, showcase, and present their art forms in community grassroots events. After this project, Riko moved into the healing arts space, where he has been practicing to master the art of Thai Vedic Healing. Since then, he's organized workshops and lectures at festivals like Burning Man, LoveBurn and Tribal Gathering. This project will be his return to the art world, for more art to come. 
 

What We Need & What You Get
We need funds to cover the costs of the art piece and to get it to both Burns. This includes, materials, labor, tools, storage, maintenance, troubleshooting, insurance, and secure transportation.
As you know, you will be contributing to this art piece as a Patron of the Arts. If you haven't donated to the production of an art piece, this is a good place to start.
For all donations of $50 or more I will carve or laser imprint your name on the piece, you as a Patron. So yes your name will be immortalized and taken to the playa for years to come!
 

The Impact
Here's an excerpt of what this art piece represents:
Found in the desert, two decorated and fully-functional doors are furnished with mirrors on both sides. They face each other and provide a perspective into both of the participants' outer and inner self. These reflections allow for a real-life experience of the infinity that is the multiverse. 
""This project will be my debut as an artist at a large festival. I have organized artists for years to exhibit art at events produced by me, this time around, I am designing this piece and ensuring it's presented at these two burns! I can't do it alone, I need the help of the community. As an incentive, if this piece ever sells, I will use the money to revive my non-profit and continue to support artists in our communities."" - Riko Chirito

Risks & Challenges
We are taking the risks of paying for the work out of pocket, and we are raising funds to expand on the quality of the design. Right now our budget only permits us to do a very simple, rather flimsy version of it, with your help we will be able to create a strong and stable piece ready to take on the challenges of being an outside interactive piece.
From the Burning Man website: ""Creating art on the playa of Black Rock City is like no canvas or gallery that you may have ever experienced before. The challenges are many. You must consider the extreme physical conditions of the desert, the logistics of transporting building materials and equipment to this remote desert site, and the difficulty of maintaining tools and equipment in a place that has no service grid or ready market of resources.""

<h3>A gorgeous calendar with great purpose</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Maya Zankoul, a Lebanese illustrator. Over the last few years I've published several books about life in Lebanon.</p>
<p>I'm also passionate about cooking and try my best to eat with the seasons because it has been proven that eating that way results in more vibrant taste, more absorbed nutrients, in addition to being more environmentally conscious.</p>
<p>This is why, last year, I produced the first 2018  Eat The Seasons calendar, showcasing the fruits and vegetables in season per month, all year round. The calendar was an instant hit and to this day I get messages from people telling me how it changed their life and improved their eating habits. I personally have also become addicted to it and can't imagine starting 2019 without it.</p>
<p>Over the last few months, I've re-designed the calendar with new, even more colorful illustrations, and added more fruits and vegetables to it. I love the result and can't wait to share it with you. </p>
<p>But the question is, should I only print one copy for my own kitchen, or would you like to have one in your home, too?</p>
<p><i>Note: All Indiegogo funds will go toward the printing cost of 200 copies.</i></p>
</div><div>
<h3>My Goal</h3>
<p>I will be printing a limited edition of 200 copies of the 2019 Eat The Seasons calendar, and printing the poster on demand. The calendar will be printed on locally recycled paper, using high quality ink. The binding will be done through a white wire binding with an easy way to hang the calendar.</p>
<p>The total cost of printing the calendars, including the IndieGogo additional 5% and processing fees is $1,740. You can participate in the project by purchasing any of the below perks.</p>

<p>My name is <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/uschwanitz"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""About me ..."">Ulrich Schwanitz</a> and I would like to introduce to you the sculpture »You &amp; Me« from the »Scrappies« figurine family. It represents love, affection and mutual commitment - emotions that everyone values and never lose their significance.</p>
<div style=""margin: 5px; float: left; text-align: center;""><a href=""http://www.trompe.nl/english/you-me/our-wedding-anniversary/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""3dview"" title=""You &amp; Me - Click to view in 3D""><img alt=""You &amp; Me - Click to view in 3D"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.trompe.nl/app/download/5594155012/you%26me+ani.gif?t=1333278991"" src="""" style="""" title=""You &amp; Me - Click to view in 3D""/><br/>Click to view in 3D</a></div>
<p>The »Scrappies« are inspired by everything you can find in a scrapyard: old nuts and bolts, tin cans, pipes, coils, parts of ball bearings.</p>
<p>But they are actually manufactured in a totally different, novel »3D printing« process. Each of them is made in one piece from fine metal powders. Check the <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/you-n-me?c=activity"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Updates</a> page for the details.</p>
<p>I had initially made the »You &amp; Me« sculpture as a unique gift for our 30th wedding anniversary, but when Christiane placed the Scrappies on her office desk, her collegues loved them so much that we thought <em>why not share it and make it available to others</em>.</p>
<p>Therefore, and for a limited time, I am offering you my work here on IndieGoGo, outside of the traditional channels of exhibiting and selling art. Each figurine will be customized with your initials of choice. I will make and ship a unique »You &amp; Me« sculpture for every supporter, be it one or many.</p>
<div>
<hr style=""background-color: gray;""/>
<h3>What's in it for YOU</h3>
<p>You want to surprise your loved one with something truly unique and special? Or give your friends an individual, creative wedding gift? Then here is your chance: become a sponsor of my campaign and secure yourself one of these cute »Scrappies« figurines. Just check out the perks – there is something for every budget.</p>
<p><strong>Don't wait</strong> for his or her next birthday, your wedding anniversary, next Christmas, or next year's Valentine's day. This campaign runs for a limited time only, don't miss the opportunity.</p>
<p>This is a Flexible Funding campaign and there is no minimum funding needed to let the project to go ahead. I guarantee that all perk'ed items will be shipped to even the smallest number of supporters. No matter how successful the project is, I will never mass-produce and every figurine will always be individually manufactured to make sure each one is truly unique.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr style=""background-color: gray;""/>
<h3>What we need &amp; what you get</h3>
<p>For me, the most important thing about this campaign is to spread the word about what I do and to share my work with you. The money from your perks will go into manufacturing each sculpture and shipping out the rewards to my supporters.</p>
<p>All time- and cost-intensive preparation has already been completed. The necessary digital designs are finished and I have samples of all sizes and material variations standing on my workbench. So I don’t even need a minimum number of supporters or money to get the project going. The only I thing I do need are</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">People that like the design as much as I do, are intrigued by the unique manufacturing process and cannot wait to hold such a one-of-a-kind item in their hands.</p>
<div>Of course I hope for a fantastic response from you, our supporters. If the »You &amp; Me – Scrappies« do become overwhelmingly successful, I plan to bundle some of the processing into larger runs and will be able to make some profit from the project. Depending on your response, you might even see me here again with future works.</div>

</div></div>","My name is Ulrich Schwanitz and I would like to introduce to you the sculpture »You & Me« from the »Scrappies« figurine family. It represents love, affection and mutual commitment - emotions that everyone values and never lose their significance.
Click to view in 3D
The »Scrappies« are inspired by everything you can find in a scrapyard: old nuts and bolts, tin cans, pipes, coils, parts of ball bearings.
But they are actually manufactured in a totally different, novel »3D printing« process. Each of them is made in one piece from fine metal powders. Check the Updates page for the details.
I had initially made the »You & Me« sculpture as a unique gift for our 30th wedding anniversary, but when Christiane placed the Scrappies on her office desk, her collegues loved them so much that we thought why not share it and make it available to others.
Therefore, and for a limited time, I am offering you my work here on IndieGoGo, outside of the traditional channels of exhibiting and selling art. Each figurine will be customized with your initials of choice. I will make and ship a unique »You & Me« sculpture for every supporter, be it one or many.


What's in it for YOU
You want to surprise your loved one with something truly unique and special? Or give your friends an individual, creative wedding gift? Then here is your chance: become a sponsor of my campaign and secure yourself one of these cute »Scrappies« figurines. Just check out the perks – there is something for every budget.
Don't wait for his or her next birthday, your wedding anniversary, next Christmas, or next year's Valentine's day. This campaign runs for a limited time only, don't miss the opportunity.
This is a Flexible Funding campaign and there is no minimum funding needed to let the project to go ahead. I guarantee that all perk'ed items will be shipped to even the smallest number of supporters. No matter how successful the project is, I will never mass-produce and every figurine will always be individually manufactured to make sure each one is truly unique.



What we need & what you get
For me, the most important thing about this campaign is to spread the word about what I do and to share my work with you. The money from your perks will go into manufacturing each sculpture and shipping out the rewards to my supporters.
All time- and cost-intensive preparation has already been completed. The necessary digital designs are finished and I have samples of all sizes and material variations standing on my workbench. So I don’t even need a minimum number of supporters or money to get the project going. The only I thing I do need are
People that like the design as much as I do, are intrigued by the unique manufacturing process and cannot wait to hold such a one-of-a-kind item in their hands.
Of course I hope for a fantastic response from you, our supporters. If the »You & Me – Scrappies« do become overwhelmingly successful, I plan to bundle some of the processing into larger runs and will be able to make some profit from the project. Depending on your response, you might even see me here again with future works.

You are wholeheartedly invited to support my project. There is a choice of rewards suitable for every budget. Take a look at the perks and if you have any questions, please let me know. Below you can already find some information about the different materials and sizes available:

Bronze-infused steel
Eternal Love: This is the original and most valuable design. The two figurines, 3.5"" (8.5 cm) high, will look beautiful anywhere, be it on your desk or in your living room. They can stand individually or be connected by their jigsaw-puzzle-shaped pedestal.
Like any of the other models, both the boy and the girl will carry an initial of your choice. We will never produce more than 99 copies of the original, full-size ""Eternal Love"" sculpture. So if you reserve one, it will probably be the only one in the world with that specific letter combination.
The original edition of »You & Me« is limited to 99 copies that are signed and numbered on the boy's pedestal.
Other full-size pictures are available at the gallery page.
Bronze Love: This is a smaller variant of the bronze sculpture. The figurines are each 2"" (5 cm) high – the ideal size and shape to be worn on a keychain or as a necklace. They will also be equipped with the two letters of your choice.

925 Sterling silver
Silver Love: Two small pendants, 1"" (2.5 cm) high. These figurines make up a cute small pair and can comfortably be worn as a pair of earrings or around your neck.
The small silver pendants retain a surprising level of detail that is similar to the original design at a quarter of the size.

Alumide
True Love: Alumide is a composite material from fine Aluminium powder and Polyamide plastic. There is a light metallic effect on the surface which does not show on the photos.
The model has the same size as the original design. The manufacturing process is less complex and therefore less costly. The figurines are also lighter than the ones from real metal.

Polyamide


I would be thrilled about any contribution. So even if you can only afford a few dollars, you can receive a special and unique reward for helping me with this project.
 
Polyamide is a light Nylon plastic that is available in several colors. The figurines are pretty light but still suitable as a keychain or pendant.

<p><strong><em><br/></em></strong>Hello friends and family!</p>
<p>I am staging a full length contemporary dance and circus production, in Montreal on 25th August 2012. It is an all original creation, using 16 artists, 6 musicians and an all original musical score. It is my first dive into producing a full length show of this size!  Please dig deep and contribute whatever you can towards this exciting project!!</p>
<p>If you are unable to donate, you can assist us by getting the word out there. Share this site on Facebook and invite people to contribute. You can ""like"" our Facebook page here: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/somethingrealshow"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/somethingrealshow</a></p>
<p>If you are in Montreal on August 25th 2012, come and see the show. Tickets are now on sale at <a href=""http://somethingreal.eventbrite.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://somethingreal.eventbrite.ca</a></p>
<p>Please read below for more information on this project.</p>
<p>thank you for you support!!</p>
<p>Meaghan Wegg </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>BACKGROUND</em></strong></p>
<p>In 2009 I achieved my dream of working for <em>Cirque du Soleil</em> when I was hired to perform in the aerial hoop trio of their classic show, <em>Quidam</em>. I toured with <em>Quidam</em> for 3 years in South America, USA and Canada. Since leaving <em>Quidam</em> I have maintained my connection with Cirque Du Soleil by working as a VIP tent animation character with <em>Amaluna</em> in Monteal.  I am now returning to my dance roots and am pursuing my passion for teaching, choreographing and directing. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION<br/></em></strong></p>
<p>I am producing and directing a live production combining both dance and circus arts, tied together with an original musical score to be performed live. Entitled <em>Something Real</em>, the full length show will be performed on August 25th 2012 at La Gare Dalhousie, Montreal, home of <em>Cirque Eloize</em>. This will be my first venture into creating and directing a full length show of this size.</p>
<p>The underlying theme of the show is stories of love, separation and heartache as interpreted through dance and circus, with particular emphasis on the lyrics expressed in each song. Traditional circus arts typically employ instrumental music to accompany the performer who then drives the story. In <em>Something Real</em>, lyrical ballads will be the main musical feature and the story’s driving force. The artists will interpret the emotion expressed by the musician’s words.</p>
<p>The musical score has been entirely composed by Tim Buckley. A combination of music performed by a live band and pre-recorded instrumental pieces will be played on the night. This is also Tim's first break into contributing performance music on a professional stage. Music from his album, Something Real, will feature in this production. Check it out on itunes: <a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/something-real/id463937627"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/something-real/id463937627</a></p>
<p>Rehearsals for the show have already begun in Montreal, Ottawa and Clinton ON. The musical score is being learnt by 5 professional musicians, and instrumental pre-recordings are being mixed / mastered.  It's all happening... get on board!!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em><strong>YOUR CONTRIBUTION TO THE SHOW!!</strong></em></p>
<p>All funds raised, regardless of the final amount will go directly to covering the costs of the project. </p>
<p>- Rental of rehearsal space and performance venue (including technical support)</p>
<p>- Equipment rental</p>
<p>- Props / costumes</p>
<p>- Marketing, ticketing, promotion</p>
<p>- Artist travel and lodging</p>
<p>Currently we are recruiting artists on a voluntary basis, and have been lucky enough to secure an incredibly generous and committed team of performers. ALL artists deserve to get paid for provision of their artistic services as career professionals. We are working hard to also secure funding from the Arts Council of Canada, in order to pay our talented artists what they are worth.</p>
<p>We are setting the goal at $5000 through this website, but total costs are likely te be 4 times this amount!!!  Makes your eyes water, doesn't it...  So any funds we can get are most welcome.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>THE SHOW'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE COMMUNITY</em></strong></p>
<p>The staging of this entirely new contemporary circus arts production will expose to the Montreal public a show in which dance, circus, and music collaborate fully rather than borrowing elements from each other. </p>
<p>Having professional artists showcase acts in new disciplines provides them an avenue for increased marketability, while the exposure of amateur performers to a professional setting provides invaluable work experience. We are inviting industry professionals from Cirque Du Soleil, Cirque Eloize and Les 7 doigts de la main, so the performance will also provide an exposure opportunity for budding performers.</p>

This goal is based on the cost of renovations to the building in 2002, adjusted for inflation, and includes items like sheetrock, lighting, flooring, and some labor costs. Almost all of the build-outs will be completed through volunteer labor of NBA members and friends. All donations to this campaign are tax-deductible. NBA is a certified 501(c)3 nonprofit.Other Ways You Can HelpPlease share this campaign with your friends and family! Even if you can't donate, spreading the word about the importance of local art cultures is incredibly valuable. Thank you for reading, and may the Arts live on!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>All of the parts of this sculpture have been prepared and are ready to go. I need $6,500 to install it. The stack of cars have been engineered and welded together. An old growth Cedar has been donated to this project as a base for the car stack.

The total cost of this project is $40,000. Thank you to the Vancouver Biennale for contributing $10,000. I have put a lot of my own money and time into this project and I have received generous donations of time and expertise from engineers, steel fabricators, and metal recyclers. What I have spent and what I expect to spend of my own money sums to $23,500. The remaining costs is the campaign goal of $6,500 for the installation. Whether I reach this goal or not, all funding will go to the project.</p>
<p>In return for your contribution I offer several of my original works, including paintings and sculptures. I’m also offering a small group to join me at the site where we can discuss the work. Be sure to check out the perks side panel for more details. I understand that not all of you can make financial contributions, so instead I encourage you to get the word out by using social media, the Indiegogo sharing tools, or simply talking about Trans Am Totem to your friends and peers.</p>

<h2 align=""left""> ""33' high and roughly 25,000 pounds.""</h2>
<p>The road to Trans Am Totem has been challenging, especially considering the scope and the size: 33' high and roughly 25,000 pounds. Initially I considered using synthetic materials to make the sculpture. But I knew I had to be true to the subject and materials involved - so I chose recycled cars and a real tree. I was really surprised by the amount of hard work it took just to take the cars apart and prepare the automobiles for the sculpture. It was pure labour and persistence. I can't thank my wife, Helene, and my friends enough for helping me slog through it. I'm also grateful to the engineers, Eric and Troy, who have donated their time and energy to this project. </p>

<p>Even before work even started, the smaller scale maquettes really got people talking, especially when they saw the sculpture montaged onto a photograph of the site at Quebec St &amp; Milross Ave. One of the powerful aspects of a sculpture is that it can engage in a 3D space with its mass and volume. Trans Am Totem's meaning is open to interpretation. I did not want it to be glib or obvious. Public Art is to be viewed multiple times, free of admission. The work must continue to be interesting on several encounters, especially so that the local Vancouver resident and international viewer can unpack their own meaning over multiple visits. This work will not disappear into the background for the 2 years of its installation. </p>
<p>The connection between the sculpture and the location is both personal and historic.

As a young man - when I worked as a deckhand on the towboats - we towed log booms into False Creek to be processed for lumber. Later, when the City of Vancouver made way for Expo '86 I saw barges full of toxic mud  towed away from False Creek and the world's largest logging camp morphed into it's current incarnation. Quebec Street &amp; Milross Ave is no longer an industrial site, it is now a major hub of movement: the viaducts, light rail, major roads, and residential towers. The wood and the cars of Trans Am Totem speak to the identity of Vancouver: Where we were, where we are, and where we are going to be. I don't claim to have answers, but I'm interested in the conversation.</p>

<p>Just days later, the project was rocked by two more early

<h3>The Mandala Project: <span style=""line-height: 38px;"">Messages From Nature</span>
</h3>
<p><img alt=""Snowy Wisteria Vine Mandala"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.fullyempowered.net/Kingston%20Art%20Day%202.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: top;"" title=""Snowy Wisteria Vine Mandala""/></p>
<p>This is the Snowy Wisteria Vine Mandala. It is here to remind us that we are ALL interconnected. What a powerful message and reminder for each of us at any point in time, but it seems, especially relevant in today’s divisive climate.</p>
<p>This Mandala has been invited to be the focal point of the 1<sup>st</sup> annual Kingston Art Festival being held in Kingston, NY on August 24, 2013. It will be on display in three separate locations throughout the festival as a 10FT x 4FT banner.  </p>
<p>It is the first of many public appearances for The Mandala Project and we need your help to share the messages of these beautiful creations far and wide.</p>
<p><strong>Your support will help us follow the Public Art thread for The Mandala Project.</strong></p>
<p>The Mandala Project is about so many things – awareness, energy, nature, meditation, our ability to create positive change, the fact that we are all connected yet we rarely remember this, the ripple effect and the notion of ‘paying-it-forward.’</p>
<p>The Mandala Project’s Facebook page is accomplishing this – people are liking and sharing each Mandala as they get posted. They are commenting, they are engaging; they are being touched, moved, inspired and guided and they are passing it on! (Check it out at <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/sharethemandalaproject"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.facebook.com/sharethemandalaproject</a> )</p>
<p><img alt=""Thread"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.fullyempowered.net/Thread.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;"" title=""Thread""/></p>
<p>I have a philosophy in life of ‘following the threads.’ When ideas come to me, I follow them until they become something bigger or they take a turn and become something else. With The Mandala Project, each thread has led to something greater and more wonderful. In my words, the project is flowing!</p>
<p>The idea to use The Mandalas as public art projects is the next thread. If they are meant to meet the world in this way, we will see a great response to this campaign and if not, we will look for the next thread to follow.</p>
<p>But I sure hope this is the next step for the project. The idea of seeing The Mandalas in action, of seeing them support and inspire and if even just for a moment, give people an opportunity to see differently, think differently or feel differently, is really exciting.</p>
<p>It is my hope that the Public Art component will be the next step for this incredibly rewarding project and your support will not only help us create the banners, floor graphics, structures and ads needed to release the Public Art component, but your support will also let us know that this is the thread to follow.</p>
<h2>Proposed Public Art Projects</h2>
<p>Here are several Public Art Projects in the works, one is confirmed, a few are proposals, one is pending and the possibility of all of them is dependent on whether we have the money to manufacture what we need to make them happen.</p>
<h3><strong style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">We Are All Connected  </strong></h3>
<h2><strong>Snowy Wisteria Vine Mandala – Kingston, NY (confirmed)</strong></h2>
<h2><strong><img alt=""Kingston Art Festival"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.fullyempowered.net/Kingston%20Art%20Day%202.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;"" title=""Kingston Art Festival""/></strong></h2>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">The Snowy Wisteria Vine Mandala will be on display in three different locations throughout the Kingston Art Festival as a 10FT x 4FT banner and staked into the ground or hung from a building (depending on the location.) Participants in each location will be led through a meditation that draws on the energy of The Snowy Wisteria Vine’s message of unity, connection and the reminder that we are ALL connected. At the end of each location’s event, participants will be invited to sign the back or leave a message on the back of The Mandala banner – creating another interconnection through the overlapping of names and messages.</span></h3>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">Reflection</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>Tannery Brook Falls Mandala- Walkway Over The Hudson (proposal)</strong></h2>
<h2><strong><img alt=""Tannery Brook Falls Mandala"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.fullyempowered.net/Tannery%20Brook%20Falls%20Mandala%207.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;"" title=""Tannery Brook Falls Mandala""/></strong></h2>
<h3><strong style=""font-size: 1.5em;""> </strong></h3>
<p><strong>This project includes an 8FT x 8FT floor graphic of the Tannery Brook Falls Mandala installed center point of the famed Walkway Over The Hudson. Participants will be invited to sit or stand in the Mandala and explore its message of clarity, of seeing the layers in life and of learning to flow with grace and ease.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>THE WISH</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>Dandelion Puff Mandala</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>Central Park Open Lawn (proposal); Storm King Sculpture Park, Storm King, NY (proposal), Art Park, Lewiston, NY (proposal)</strong></h2>
<h2><strong><img alt=""Dandelion Puff Mandala 12"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.fullyempowered.net/Dandelion%20Puff%20Mandala%2012.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;"" title=""Dandelion Puff Mandala 12""/></strong></h2>
<h2><strong> </strong></h2>
<p><strong><img alt=""Dandelion Puff Mandala Play Parachute"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://fullyempowered.net/Dandelion%20Puff%20Play%20Parachute.gif"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/>Do you remember ‘play parachutes?’ Maybe you played with them in gym class or at day camp, well, The Dandelion Puff Mandala shares a whimsical and playful message of taking time to out to play and to dream.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>This project entails the creation of a 24FT Diameter play parachute of The Dandelion Puff Mandala. Participants will be invited to grab a spot along the edge of the play parachute, will be guided through a simple meditation to help them tap into the energy of the Dandelion Puff, then led through a series of play parachute games, ending with everyone energizing a hand full of grass seed with two wishes to toss energetically onto the Mandala– one for themselves and one for the planet. In a symbol of release the play parachute will be tossed up, releasing the seeds and the wishes, just as we have done as a child when blowing on the Dandelion Puff.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Messages From Nature - NYC Subway (Proposal)</h2>
<h2><img alt=""NY Subway Day Lily"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.fullyempowered.net/NY%20Subway%20Day%20Lily%20Mandala.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""NY Subway Day Lily""/></h2>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Imagine standing on the subway platform and encountering one of The Mandalas - stunning, inviting, refreshing and healing. Each ad will include one of The Mandalas, the name of the mandala and a single word like 'inspire' or 'hope' or 'love'. Each ad will also include a QR code that will take the viewer to The Mandala on The Mandala Project's Facebook page, which will offer additional information and guidance in using this mandala and in an effort ot continue the ripple encourage viewers to share the project with their community.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Projections - a Mandala Project Flash Mob - Snow, Water, Sand, Buildings (Proposal)</strong></h2>
<p><strong>What if you were walking down the street and suddenly in front of you was The Snow Drop Mandala sharing it's message of Hope; or you were at a sky resort and there on the night slope was the Hosta Flower Mandala sharing it's message of Prayers Answered. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Projections will require a special GOBO machine that will allow for high powered projection in any setting, day or night. Plus it requires a special housing for the machine itself to protect it from weather. Once we have the machine, the possilbities are endless though. We have visions of Pop up Mandalas on the beaches, on the snow, on the side of buildings - think of it like a Mandala Project flash mob!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong><img alt=""Giving"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.fullyempowered.net/Hands%20giving%20money.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;"" title=""Giving""/>What happens with the money raised?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>$1000</strong> launches The Snowy Wisteria Vine Mandala project. We have figured it will cost $1000 to create the banner and install it in three separate locations. Once the banner is created, we will have it to use at other festivals and events.</p>
<p><strong>$2000</strong> launches the above plus The Tannery Brook Falls project – The floor graphic will need to be specially made because of its size. It will cost about $1000. Unless I can find a way to make it moveable, this will be a one-time event as the graphic will be adhered to the ground. I am exploring the idea of having the graphic made in sections that can be placed on Masonite boards. If this works, then the project will be portable and can be done at additional venues.</p>
<p><strong>$7800</strong> launches the above plus Messages From Nature - NYC Subway Project. This will let us create four subway platform ads that will be on display for 4 weeks. Imagine the impact and the number of people this will reach. Each add is approximately $1200. If we raise more, we can place additional ads.</p>
<p><strong>$12,000</strong> launches the above plus THE WISH – yes a big jump. The play parachute will need to be custom made – everything from the silk screening of the material to the sewing of the parachute itself. In the end though, we will have an awesome addition to The Mandala Project – one giant Dandelion Puff Mandala play parachute!</p>
<p><strong>$20,000 </strong>launches the above plus PROJECTIONS - A Mandala Project Flash Mob. This will enable us to purchase the projector and create custom glass GOBOs with images of The Mandalas, that's all that is needed to be able to do this project. From there all we need is a blank canvas to project onto - walls, floors, sand, snow, open fields, the possiblities are endless!</p>
<p>This is just an example of how funding will be used. More ideas will continue to sprout, so all funding will help to share the ripple effect of The Mandala Project.</p>
<p><strong>BIG DREAMS – </strong>I dream of seeing The Mandalas on billboards, installed in museums and hospitals as interactive mandalas, installed in public transit as mosaic tile installations – there are no shortage of creative ideas springing up around The Mandala Project</p>
<p> </p>

<p>I have Scorpio Rising and Scorpio as my Sun sign which makes me passionate and deeply connected to the metaphysical nature of life. I’m tempered by a lovely Gemini Moon, which makes me talkative. Each sign has a motto, and Scorpio’s is I Create; Gemini is ‘I Dream’. So combine the double creativity with dreaming and it fuels my passion to support people by being inspired to create new ways of helping people live life to the fullest.</p>
<p>I love to learn, heal and grow and to share what I have discovered with those for whom my information seems to resonate. I am fascinated by our life’s journey, how we learn our lessons and I relish in the opportunity to help people see, find and embrace a simpler, drama-free approach to moving through their days.</p>
<p>Over the years I have written two books, published two decks of conscious living guidance cards and written countless articles for a variety of publications including Beliefnet.com and Gaiam Life. I have been teaching and supporting people around the world in creating the lives of their dreams since 1999.  I’ve been on Animal Planet TV, featured in the New York Times, cited in several books including Supernatural America: A Cultural History, Messages From Spirit by Collete Baron-Reid and the New York Times Bestseller Grace: A Memoir by Grace Coddington. In October, I’m honored to be giving the Keynote talk at the first ever Women of India Leadership Summit in Delhi, India.</p>
<p>I have, what I like to call, a tool basket of skills: a BFA in painting and printmaking, an MBA, a Traditional Naturopaths degree as well as a Master Herbalist degree and a collection of certifications in everything from clairvoyance to aromatherapy to reflexology. Skills that, to many over the years, seemed disconnected, but always for me, have been very connected. Creativity, clear seeing and a business sense have yielded who I am today; grounded, certain, passionate, creative and a boundary pusher.</p>
<p>The Mandala Project combines many of the tools that I feel help to create powerful and positive change in our lives. The project is designed to encourage a deeper connection to nature and energy; to tap into the power of meditation and to explore the positive experience of The Ripple Effect and paying-it-forward.</p>
<p>As the project has unfolded, The Mandalas are inspiring people to interact, to share and to pass their experience on to friends and family – everything I had hoped for.</p>
<p>I believe the next step for The Mandala Project is to take them into the public arena. They are already being shown in various shows from NYC to Woodstock, NY to Connecticut, and as much as I love seeing them framed and hanging in a gallery for people to reflect upon, The Mandalas yearn to get out and interact.</p>

This is the Snowy Wisteria Vine Mandala. It is here to remind us that we are ALL interconnected. What a powerful message and reminder for each of us at any point in time, but it seems, especially relevant in today’s divisive climate.
This Mandala has been invited to be the focal point of the 1st annual Kingston Art Festival being held in Kingston, NY on August 24, 2013. It will be on display in three separate locations throughout the festival as a 10FT x 4FT banner.  
It is the first of many public appearances for The Mandala Project and we need your help to share the messages of these beautiful creations far and wide.
Your support will help us follow the Public Art thread for The Mandala Project.
The Mandala Project is about so many things – awareness, energy, nature, meditation, our ability to create positive change, the fact that we are all connected yet we rarely remember this, the ripple effect and the notion of ‘paying-it-forward.’
The Mandala Project’s Facebook page is accomplishing this – people are liking and sharing each Mandala as they get posted. They are commenting, they are engaging; they are being touched, moved, inspired and guided and they are passing it on! (Check it out at www.facebook.com/sharethemandalaproject )

I have a philosophy in life of ‘following the threads.’ When ideas come to me, I follow them until they become something bigger or they take a turn and become something else. With The Mandala Project, each thread has led to something greater and more wonderful. In my words, the project is flowing!
The idea to use The Mandalas as public art projects is the next thread. If they are meant to meet the world in this way, we will see a great response to this campaign and if not, we will look for the next thread to follow.
But I sure hope this is the next step for the project. The idea of seeing The Mandalas in action, of seeing them support and inspire and if even just for a moment, give people an opportunity to see differently, think differently or feel differently, is really exciting.
It is my hope that the Public Art component will be the next step for this incredibly rewarding project and your support will not only help us create the banners, floor graphics, structures and ads needed to release the Public Art component, but your support will also let us know that this is the thread to follow.
Proposed Public Art Projects
Here are several Public Art Projects in the works, one is confirmed, a few are proposals, one is pending and the possibility of all of them is dependent on whether we have the money to manufacture what we need to make them happen.
We Are All Connected  
Snowy Wisteria Vine Mandala – Kingston, NY (confirmed)

The Snowy Wisteria Vine Mandala will be on display in three different locations throughout the Kingston Art Festival as a 10FT x 4FT banner and staked into the ground or hung from a building (depending on the location.) Participants in each location will be led through a meditation that draws on the energy of The Snowy Wisteria Vine’s message of unity, connection and the reminder that we are ALL connected. At the end of each location’s event, participants will be invited to sign the back or leave a message on the back of The Mandala banner – creating another interconnection through the overlapping of names and messages.
 
Reflection
Tannery Brook Falls Mandala- Walkway Over The Hudson (proposal)

 
This project includes an 8FT x 8FT floor graphic of the Tannery Brook Falls Mandala installed center point of the famed Walkway Over The Hudson. Participants will be invited to sit or stand in the Mandala and explore its message of clarity, of seeing the layers in life and of learning to flow with grace and ease.
 
 
THE WISH
Dandelion Puff Mandala
Central Park Open Lawn (proposal); Storm King Sculpture Park, Storm King, NY (proposal), Art Park, Lewiston, NY (proposal)

 
Do you remember ‘play parachutes?’ Maybe you played with them in gym class or at day camp, well, The Dandelion Puff Mandala shares a whimsical and playful message of taking time to out to play and to dream.  
This project entails the creation of a 24FT Diameter play parachute of The Dandelion Puff Mandala. Participants will be invited to grab a spot along the edge of the play parachute, will be guided through a simple meditation to help them tap into the energy of the Dandelion Puff, then led through a series of play parachute games, ending with everyone energizing a hand full of grass seed with two wishes to toss energetically onto the Mandala– one for themselves and one for the planet. In a symbol of release the play parachute will be tossed up, releasing the seeds and the wishes, just as we have done as a child when blowing on the Dandelion Puff.
 
Messages From Nature - NYC Subway (Proposal)

 
Imagine standing on the subway platform and encountering one of The Mandalas - stunning, inviting, refreshing and healing. Each ad will include one of The Mandalas, the name of the mandala and a single word like 'inspire' or 'hope' or 'love'. Each ad will also include a QR code that will take the viewer to The Mandala on The Mandala Project's Facebook page, which will offer additional information and guidance in using this mandala and in an effort ot continue the ripple encourage viewers to share the project with their community.
 
Projections - a Mandala Project Flash Mob - Snow, Water, Sand, Buildings (Proposal)
What if you were walking down the street and suddenly in front of you was The Snow Drop Mandala sharing it's message of Hope; or you were at a sky resort and there on the night slope was the Hosta Flower Mandala sharing it's message of Prayers Answered. 
Projections will require a special GOBO machine that will allow for high powered projection in any setting, day or night. Plus it requires a special housing for the machine itself to protect it from weather. Once we have the machine, the possilbities are endless though. We have visions of Pop up Mandalas on the beaches, on the snow, on the side of buildings - think of it like a Mandala Project flash mob!
 
 
 
What happens with the money raised?
$1000 launches The Snowy Wisteria Vine Mandala project. We have figured it will cost $1000 to create the banner and install it in three separate locations. Once the banner is created, we will have it to use at other festivals and events.
$2000 launches the above plus The Tannery Brook Falls project – The floor graphic will need to be specially made because of its size. It will cost about $1000. Unless I can find a way to make it moveable, this will be a one-time event as the graphic will be adhered to the ground. I am exploring the idea of having the graphic made in sections that can be placed on Masonite boards. If this works, then the project will be portable and can be done at additional venues.
$7800 launches the above plus Messages From Nature - NYC Subway Project. This will let us create four subway platform ads that will be on display for 4 weeks. Imagine the impact and the number of people this will reach. Each add is approximately $1200. If we raise more, we can place additional ads.
$12,000 launches the above plus THE WISH – yes a big jump. The play parachute will need to be custom made – everything from the silk screening of the material to the sewing of the parachute itself. In the end though, we will have an awesome addition to The Mandala Project – one giant Dandelion Puff Mandala play parachute!
$20,000 launches the above plus PROJECTIONS - A Mandala Project Flash Mob. This will enable us to purchase the projector and create custom glass GOBOs with images of The Mandalas, that's all that is needed to be able to do this project. From there all we need is a blank canvas to project onto - walls, floors, sand, snow, open fields, the possiblities are endless!
This is just an example of how funding will be used. More ideas will continue to sprout, so all funding will help to share the ripple effect of The Mandala Project.
BIG DREAMS – I dream of seeing The Mandalas on billboards, installed in museums and hospitals as interactive mandalas, installed in public transit as mosaic tile installations – there are no shortage of creative ideas springing up around The Mandala Project
 
 
A Little About Christine Agro, Creator of The Mandala Project
I have Scorpio Rising and Scorpio as my Sun sign which makes me passionate and deeply connected to the metaphysical nature of life. I’m tempered by a lovely Gemini Moon, which makes me talkative. Each sign has a motto, and Scorpio’s is I Create; Gemini is ‘I Dream’. So combine the double creativity with dreaming and it fuels my passion to support people by being inspired to create new ways of helping people live life to the fullest.
I love to learn, heal and grow and to share what I have discovered with those for whom my information seems to resonate. I am fascinated by our life’s journey, how we learn our lessons and I relish in the opportunity to help people see, find and embrace a simpler, drama-free approach to moving through their days.
Over the years I have written two books, published two decks of conscious living guidance cards and written countless articles for a variety of publications including Beliefnet.com and Gaiam Life. I have been teaching and supporting people around the world in creating the lives of their dreams since 1999.  I’ve been on Animal Planet TV, featured in the New York Times, cited in several books including Supernatural America: A Cultural History, Messages From Spirit by Collete Baron-Reid and the New York Times Bestseller Grace: A Memoir by Grace Coddington. In October, I’m honored to be giving the Keynote talk at the first ever Women of India Leadership Summit in Delhi, India.
I have, what I like to call, a tool basket of skills: a BFA in painting and printmaking, an MBA, a Traditional Naturopaths degree as well as a Master Herbalist degree and a collection of certifications in everything from clairvoyance to aromatherapy to reflexology. Skills that, to many over the years, seemed disconnected, but always for me, have been very connected. Creativity, clear seeing and a business sense have yielded who I am today; grounded, certain, passionate, creative and a boundary pusher.
The Mandala Project combines many of the tools that I feel help to create powerful and positive change in our lives. The project is designed to encourage a deeper connection to nature and energy; to tap into the power of meditation and to explore the positive experience of The Ripple Effect and paying-it-forward.
As the project has unfolded, The Mandalas are inspiring people to interact, to share and to pass their experience on to friends and family – everything I had hoped for.
I believe the next step for The Mandala Project is to take them into the public arena. They are already being shown in various shows from NYC to Woodstock, NY to Connecticut, and as much as I love seeing them framed and hanging in a gallery for people to reflect upon, The Mandalas yearn to get out and interact.

<p>UPDATE 12/17/13: Thank you to everyone who helped.  All 98 funders made this possible.  If you are looking for the new Activity Books, you can find them <a href=""http://www.kcymaerxthaere.com/index.php/cart"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here at the Kcymaerxthaere Exports store</a>.  The prices are a little bit higher than the early adopters got by supporting the project during the campaign--but still a great value. If you missed the campaign, <a href=""http://www.kcymaerxthaere.com/index.php/cart"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the other perks are available at the Exports store too</a>, but at their standard prices. <a href=""http://www.kcymaerxthaere.com/index.php/content/gmap"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Visit Kcymaerxthaere installations</a> and tell us about it on <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/kcymaerxthaere"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> or twitter (@kcym).

<p>UPDATE 12/3/13: <a href=""http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/counties/los-angeles/eames-demetrios-kcymaerxthaere.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Excellent Online Article on Kcymaerxthaere</a>.  Now, back to our regularly scheduled program . . .</p>
<p>My name is Eames Demetrios and I have a parallel universe.  Creating it continues to be an amazing journey--and a whole lot of that fun comes from sharing it with other people.  This activity book is the next step.</p>
<p>For the past decade I have been traveling the world--installing markers and historic sites that honor events from that parallel world in our linear world.  So far we have <a href=""http://www.kcymaerxthaere.com/index.php/content/gmap"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">98 sites in 22 countries</a>, with more on the way.  I call this project Kcymaerxthaere and it is a bit like a novel with every page in a different place.  Where you read such a page out in the landscape (doesn't matter if it is remote or urban), it influences how you visualize that story. It may sound a bit unusual, but it is so rewarding to see how many people enjoy conjuring up another reality without a single digital enhancement--all by themselves in the real world with their minds.</p>
<p>I have a background as a filmmaker and have written <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Eames-Primer-Revised-Demetrios/dp/0847839443"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'>several books</a> on <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Eames-Demetrios/e/B001KH8J1O/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_pop_1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'>various topics</a> (this will be the fourth from <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Travel-Guide-Four-Kcymaerxthaere-Estrelliia/dp/1616580216/ref=la_B001KH8J1O_1_7?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1384953689&amp;sr=1-7"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kcymaerxthaere</a>), but ultimately I think I consider myself a storyteller. I have even done a number of TED talks--on the <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/the_design_genius_of_charles_and_ray_eames.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'>TED Mainstage</a> and at quite a few <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LMFh3pGjoc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'>TEDx venues</a>.<br/></p>
<p>Putting it altogether, one of our key goals is to help people look at the world <i>fresh</i>, to start to see what's not there.  First, that is a great space in which to tell a story.  But, even though it sounds crazy in a way, I think it can help us come up with new ways to help ourselves and our world.  After all, most of the really important things in our lives--relationships, careers, businesses, families--DIDN'T exist before they did.  So what's <i>not</i> there is often the stuff that is our very essence. </p>
<p>Before we get to specifics, here's more about the project in general: </p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""326"" src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/69931906"" title=""Discover Kcymaerxthaere"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p>Ultimately I think that is what crowd funding is all about: to connect people with beautiful and unexpected projects that they can then help the artist or creator bring them into the world.  This will be my third IndieGoGo--here's <a href=""https://vimeo.com/79815026"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">what we did with the last one</a>!</p>
<p>SO WHAT IS <i>THIS</i> ALL ABOUT?</p>
<p>One of the most rewarding aspects of watching people enjoy the stories and installations of Kcymaerxthaere over the years has been observing the different interpretations of the stories and characters they've created.  Even though we have physical installations, I always wanted to sketch the characters, creatures and stories into people's minds with words and implications, so they imagined all that for themselves.  And, from the beginning, I looked for ways to go further.  And so I started to ask people to draw what they thought things looked like.  In this way, we could tell the audience what the creatures MIGHT look like, but at the same time kind of take it away--by pointing out we are not <i>sure</i> that the renderings are exactly right. In Kcymaerxthaere, we call such interpretations <i>Disputed Likenesses</i>.  </p>
<p>We've done <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/groups/2357514@N25/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">workshops</a> around the world based on this idea.  And it is time to take it to the next level by creating a way for people to play on their own and share their images as well. </p>
<p>I have to add that as a kid, and then with my own kids, I was never a huge fan of connecting the dots or coloring books (yes, I know there are a couple cool ones!).  It could be a fun puzzle sometimes, but it always seemed like the person who made it had already had all the fun!</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/207330/files/20131118143902-IMG_3869.jpg?1384814342"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p>That's why we've created an activity book we call <i>Please DON'T Connect the Dots. </i>It catalyzes thinking and creativity from the stories of Kcymaerxthaere.  And even though kids love the challenge, we find that adults have a great time on the journey too.  So not only it is a great holiday gift for the kids in your life, it is a pretty cool business gift too (and not just during the season).</p>
<p>WHAT ARE YOU ASKING FOR?</p>
<p>We aren't asking for a gift.  We are asking you to support this project by buying the book (or the other things) in advance.  And also we are offering some of the other amazing Disputed Likenesses we have done over the years-- all of which come with a complimentary activity book. </p>
<p>In return, the shipping is free (see our note at the end about timing), the book is discounted and you will be the first to share this great Activity Book with your community.</p>
<p>And if you get some of the bigger perks, we are offering a discount as our show of appreciation of your support.</p>
<p>HOW DOES THIS HELP THE PROJECT?</p>
<p>For the Kcymaerxthaere project, there is another benefit as important as the financial one: seeing different Disputed Likenesses of the same <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/groups/gnaciensofkcymaerxthaere/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">creature</a> (or character or <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/groups/2380019@N20/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">story</a>) is sometimes the best way to understand what something in Kcymaerxthaere might have looked like.  Because there are many dimensions of Kcymaerxthaere, it is tricky to represent aspects of the parallel world precisely in our world.  <i>Your</i> interpretations put into drawing is the best way to help share Kcymaerxthaere's stories with others and connect them across the globe!<br/></p>
<p>So we are currently encouraging people to share their Disputed Likenesses from our workshops through our Flickr groups, but we believe Please DON'T Connect the Dots will take it to a new level.  All those groups of Disputed Likenesses accessible through our portal website <a href=""http://disputedlikeness.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'>disputedlikeness.com</a>.  </p>

Being an artist is a struggle, and finding a place to buy, sell, or showcase your art is just as hard. For certain mediums, like glass, finding a way to further you skills and education in that medium can be even harder. This is where my dream comes in. The area i live in has no center for art. There are very few shops that sell any kind of art and most of them import generic stuff to make a quick buck. I have purchased a large (16,000 square foot!) building to change all that. My plan is to have a storefront/gallery on the ground floor for everything from glass art to print art to hand made clothing. Anything art. Anything hand made by skilled artisans and/or craftsmen (or craftswomen!) I will have my own personal studio right in the front window to show people the wonders of glass art first hand, In the basement I plan to have a large glass studio for live demos, classes, and studio space available and 24/7 access for those who cannot have their own studio at home. There is a lot of space so possibly a clay art or other medium studio down there as well, depending on community response. The top floor will be entertainment. Music, plays, spoken word, yoga classes, wedding receptions, you name it we can have it there! All in the name of bringing culture and art to a town trying to bounce back from the decline of the steel industry. There has recently been a slight turn around in the area for businesses. Larger ones are moving in and I don't want to see everything completely commercialized. There is a place in this world for true art and individual craftspeople. I want this to be the outlet for them so they don't get buried by mass produced big business. Now all this doesn't come cheap! I am working 40+ hours a week to fund this and doing all of the renovations and research and filing of papers by myself. I am probably putting in over 100 hours a week on this! And it is slow going. That is where you come in. Any help is a great help! Whether is monetary, volunteer work, telling your friends about it, anything. Of course money helps a lot! Studio equipment, drywall, plumbing supplies, running electric to accommodate lighting and everything else takes a lot. Thank you for reading this and I hope you can find it in you heart to help. :-)</p></div>","I have been an artist my whole life.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Wildflower was founded in 2009 to meet the demands for a local women's publication in Northern Nevada. It has since become an international project with contributors from around the world. We are continuing to expand and will be releasing four large print issues this coming year.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We call Wildflower ""female-positive"" -- it is a place where women can share their creativity and their stories in a respectful, inspirational setting. Women and men alike have expressed gratitude for offering a female publication that covers all subjects and aspects of women's lives, and for featuring artists who make people think and reflect through their words and visual images. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need funding to help cover our operation costs. Printing costs are very expensive and they limit how far we can expand the publication. The magazine will continue to be available even if we don't meet our goal, but in order to make it affordable and accessible to those who may be struggling in this economy, we are trying to make each issue cost as little as possible. </p>

<p>We would also like to pay our regular contributors for their hard work and exceptional art that allow the magazine to thrive. </p>

</div></div>","In the Battle of Ideas, Aesthetics Matter

Occupy Wall Street is a lot of things. But at the core it's a conversation -- a conversation about tactics, a conversation about democracy, a conversation about in what kind of world we want to live.

 
For a successful conversation, parameters are defined, topics delineated. The consensus-building at Zuccotti Park works on this, slowly, methodically, setting the stage for further action.
 It's a lot of talk, and a lot of effort, but, for a lot of people, it just doesn't matter. 

Why? Because to them we look like a bunch of dirty hippies.

Conversation: Over.




We Propose a Solution: Suits

We all look great in suits. To reporters, to workers, to skeptical tourists, we'll look like people to listen to, or, at the very least, to hear out. Lazy journalists won't be able to easily dismiss us and will have to actually listen to what we say. The conversation will grow out of the echo chamber and into the wider world -- where it belongs.


Suits are camouflage in the warrens of Wall Street. And there are other advantages.
 Need a bathroom? Try wearing a suit. It's easy.


Want to walk past a police barricade? Put on a suit.


Let's Show Them We're Serious
In the 1960s you could fly your freak flag high. In 2011, it just looks sloppy. We are the 99 percent, but we need the support of the 60 percent who think we're just messing around.
 On October 15, our crack team of well dressed artists, designers, and wardrobers will deliver racks and racks of business attire, free of charge to anyone at Liberty Square. We'll be joined by progressive tailors, radical barbers, and folks who want everyone to look great. The way you say it matters as much as what you say. So say it in style. Say it in a suit.What We Need and What You Get
You can help us realize this vision with your donations. Twenty dollars will put a protester in a crisp thrift store suit.


Or mail us a nice suit you're not using anymore. It’s free if you mail it from work. Here's our address:

Proper Business Attire Working GroupC/O The House of Yes342 Maujer StreetBrooklyn, NY11206Extra suits and late deliveries will be donated to Threads for Success, an innovative New York City program that dresses young people in the justice system for court appearances and job interviews.
Let's get organized.

Look sharp. The whole world is watching.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Three years ago I took another big intuitive leap and followed my dreams to New Mexico ~ my spiritual home.  Since then I've re-established my studio at the Factory on 5th Art Space and become active in the dynamic local poetry scene.  My little camera snuck up behind me to surprise and charm me with her fresh perspective and singular eye.  Her keen, playful, meditative ways have opened me to more expansive and, at once, intimate creative leaps.  'LiTTLe GRaCie' is now my near constant companion.   </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Photography is the primary focus of this Indiegogo campaign, and with your help, I am certain photography is the medium that will springboard my life and living to the next level.  I've taken huge LeaPs to get this far, made pennies sing, and stretched my financial 'net' to maximum...'stretchage'. </p>

We must walk consciously only part way toward our goal then LEAP in the dark to our success.
~ Henry David Thoreau

Leap and the NET will appear...   



Hand-Tied Sinew Fishing Net with Cottonwood Floats [4WTfn1] ... an apropos image to include here.  I had the privilege of participating in and photographing the Earth Skills Gathering at the Valles Caldera National Preserve here in New Mexico over the Memorial Day weekend.



And now? a playful and curious video to 'catch' your attention...  

WHO AM I?                 
aLLo!   My name is Julie SuZaNNe BroKKeN.  

I am an artist ~ poeta ~ photographer.  I must be part frog, too, with this compulsion for leaping from creative 'lily pad' to creative 'lily pad'.  And, as you can see, I'm quite fond of water.  I am TiCKLeD PiNK to welcome you to my LeaPs aBouND Indiegogo Campaign.  
Three years ago I took another big intuitive leap and followed my dreams to New Mexico ~ my spiritual home.  Since then I've re-established my studio at the Factory on 5th Art Space and become active in the dynamic local poetry scene.  My little camera snuck up behind me to surprise and charm me with her fresh perspective and singular eye.  Her keen, playful, meditative ways have opened me to more expansive and, at once, intimate creative leaps.  'LiTTLe GRaCie' is now my near constant companion.   
Photography is the primary focus of this Indiegogo campaign, and with your help, I am certain photography is the medium that will springboard my life and living to the next level.  I've taken huge LeaPs to get this far, made pennies sing, and stretched my financial 'net' to maximum...'stretchage'. 
Read more ""Who Am I?"", if you wish & my full artist's blurp @   http://juliebrokken.blogspot.com/2013/09/leaps-abound-who-am-i.html

WHY AM I HERE?

I am a woman on a mission...
Part of which is to brighten, soothe and enlighten.  To facilitate healing and growth. To add some whimsy and laughter.  To invite introspection. To uplift, inspire, and foster the shifts that make our individual and collective lives better.  To celebrate our precious Mother Earth and to foster better care for her and all her inhabitants.  To live my higher purpose. 
This creative life is a calling.  No matter what medium or discipline I use to I express myself ~ photography, painting, poetry, assemblage, installation art ~ it is my hope that it invite others to reflect upon and to cherish this beloved Mother Earth and these unlikely lives we are blessed to live on this...
compelling     deeply beautiful     shadowy
light-infused     joyful     mysterious
ever-evolving     crazy     precious
confounding     mystical     miraculous
... planet!  Life is but a precious dream or magic show flowing down this bejeweled and luscious stream full of grace.

We currently run #15secondcardistry on Instagram, and School of Cardistry on YouTube.Involving 10 Cardists across 5 different countries, the Cardistry of Southeast Asia DVD is the largest Cardistry project ever. Get to know these masters who are constantly pushing the boundaries of this art, and gain insights from the creative minds of the hundreds of practitioners in the region.These 10 cardists are:
Rama Dimasatria from Indonesia, Champion of CDM 2011
Terry Lu from Thailand, Champion of CCC 2011
Abie Jie Assegaff from Indonesia, Champion of Dan and Dave's Smokes and Mirrors V7 Trailer Contest

Yang Nguyen, Semi-finalist in WKC 2014 (ongoing)

AJ Arandilla from Philippines, Top 8 in WKC 2014
Khanh from Vietnam, Top 16 in WKC 2014
Amsyar Fikri from Malaysia, Top 16 in WKC 2014
Zombieflourish from Vietnam
Ilyta from Vietnam
David Gooi from Malaysia
Jaspas Deck will also be giving lectures in Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta and Manila.Update 22 March 2014: Today we announce 2 MORE Cardists joining our star-studded crew of 8 in this amazing DVD. The 2 new additions, Abie Jie and Yang Nguyen, are both award-winning Cardists. Abie Jie was the champion in Dan and Dave's Smokes and Mirrors V7 Trailer Contest, and Yang Nguyen is currently a semi-finalist in the on-going World Kardistry Championship.We've spent months searching for something special to present to you. Something different. The DVD itself features moves from 8 Southeast Asian Cardists. There will also be footage of the lectures and jams that will be held while we are in each location. Find out what goes on in the minds of people on this side of the globe! If you get the physical copy of the DVD, it also comes with an insert full of photography, comments and notes from the tour.Other perks include a limited-edition deck of cards specially designed for this project. These cards are only available with a purchase of the DVD. You might notice that the court cards have been changed. These look great for spinning moves like the Pirouette, and provide a more consistent look for displays. Jaspas Deck's S.E.A. Tour Lecture Notes are a 60-page set of notes detailing his 12 years of experience as a Cardist. In it, he talks about everything from how to improve your skills, to live performances and creating moves. A large portion of the notes are dedicated to videography basics, tips and tricks.*The above images are of prototypes, actual products may vary.We've

This project will be the precedent for further documentaries of Cardistry scenes around the world. We're looking forward to meeting all of you guys everywhere and sharing your Cardistry with the rest of the world.Also, 10% of our profits will be donated to the Philippines Red Cross for the Typhoon Yolanda disaster that happened in November last year. We really appreciate if you could help to share this project on your social media profiles. Southeast Asian Cardists, please support the project by joining us for the lectures and jams in your respective countries.

</p><p> <strong><em>*If you are unaware of what a longboard skateboard is, please click </em></strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longboarding"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong><em>here</em></strong></a><strong><em>*</em></strong></p>
<h2><strong>About Us</strong></h2>
<p>We are <strong>Charlie</strong> and <strong>Chris</strong>, college students hailing from East Lansing, Michigan. Charlie is an Economics major and Chris is a Business Administration major. Both of us have been avid longboarders since middle school and know everything there is to know about it. We have known each other since we were young lads and are both very like-minded individuals with complementary skill sets.</p>
<p>Our lifelong dream is to own our own small business, and what better way to accomplish that dream than to combine it with something we are very passionate about?</p>
<p>Growing up with longboards we have learned a lot not only about the sport, but the industry. Our idea is to start our own longboard company so that we can put our knowledge and expertise to use, and spread the sensation sweeping the nation.</p>
<p>One thing we both despise about the longboard industry is the costliness of the sport, to get a high quality board you usually need upwards of $250. This struck us as ridiculous, so we checked into it, and it turns out we can produce our own boards with the same quality for up to $100 less than that of the big name brands. Our mission is  to provide top notch longboards on an affordable budget.</p>
<p>To give our product more of a niche, all of our boards will portray unique graphics designed by local, up and coming artists. Every artist that contributes will be compensated per design, and given special credit on our site as promotion. For example, we plan to have an ""<strong>artisit bio</strong>"" page, in which information on each specific artist will be displayed including a picture. Our site is still under construction but feel free to check it out at <a href=""http://goo.gl/TSmMvi"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">goo.gl/TSmMvi</a></p>
<p><img alt=""This is a sample sketch done by one of our artists, Alex B."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/59915_1610733866654_972779_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This is a sample sketch done by one of our artists, Alex B.</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>Our initial target audience is college students, with a focus on Michigan State University, where we go to school. Longboarding is very popular here and is continuously growing as a quick and easy way of getting to class. The local market is very large and we hope to capitalize on this influx of customers. In essence, our business aims to spread the fascinating sport of longboarding while showcasing amazing artwork done by the customer's very own peers.</p>
<p>We plan to utilize internet sales only at first, while trying to maintain a strong local presence. We have met with other local business leaders about joint marketing in hopes of building local recognition before branching outwards to other parts of the state, and eventually the country.</p>
<p>Being based in the college town of East Lansing, MI we feel as though we are in a great location to start a skate company. The high volume of students provides a large market of young people in need of not only sport and recreation, but transportation as well. Longboarding is quickly becoming a favored mode of transportation on college campuses, mainly for this reason; <strong>any one can do it</strong>. People of all shapes and sizes, all genders, regardless of athleticism and coordination can pick it up with a little practice.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> These are the different deck designs we will be using for our boards.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Where Your Money Is Going</h2>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><p>We both can barely contain our excitement to get this thing moving, but we need something from you first!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Around $5,000 of the $7000 we are trying to raise will go directly to our initial order of parts from our supplier including wheels, bearings, bushings, trucks, decks etc. and the cost of production. The remaining $2,000 will go towards paying artists, and printing their designs onto our decks. This is just about the bare minimum, any more is greatly appreciated as it will allow us to grow more quickly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If we do not raise the necessary funds,we will simply try again. Maybe take out a loan, maybe try a different crowd funding site, or maybe even have a big garage sale! The point is, this is truly our dream and we will stop at nothing until we accomplish it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have taken this idea as far as we can by ourselves, and are now asking for your help to make our dream a reality! We have gotten the necessary tax forms, registered with the state and lined up suppliers. All we need now is funding, and we will be ready to start a new, highly profitable, chapter to our lives. Our futures lie in your hands!</p>
<p><em>If you cannot afford the $10 minimum but still want to contribute, we will make sure to send you a great thank you email! Anything helps! </em><em>Share with your friends and family! </em></p>
<p><em><br/></em>*All contributors will receive a link to an exclusive blog to follow our progress*</p>

Every artist that contributes will be compensated per design, and given special credit on our site as promotion. For example, we plan to have an ""artisit bio"" page, in which information on each specific artist will be displayed including a picture. Our site is still under construction but feel free to check it out at goo.gl/TSmMvi

This is a sample sketch done by one of our artists, Alex B.
Goals
Our initial target audience is college students, with a focus on Michigan State University, where we go to school. Longboarding is very popular here and is continuously growing as a quick and easy way of getting to class. The local market is very large and we hope to capitalize on this influx of customers. In essence, our business aims to spread the fascinating sport of longboarding while showcasing amazing artwork done by the customer's very own peers.
We plan to utilize internet sales only at first, while trying to maintain a strong local presence. We have met with other local business leaders about joint marketing in hopes of building local recognition before branching outwards to other parts of the state, and eventually the country.
Being based in the college town of East Lansing, MI we feel as though we are in a great location to start a skate company. The high volume of students provides a large market of young people in need of not only sport and recreation, but transportation as well. Longboarding is quickly becoming a favored mode of transportation on college campuses, mainly for this reason; any one can do it. People of all shapes and sizes, all genders, regardless of athleticism and coordination can pick it up with a little practice.
 

 This is our prototype longboard deck, designed by one of our artists, Connor M.

 These are the different deck designs we will be using for our boards.
 
Where Your Money Is Going


We both can barely contain our excitement to get this thing moving, but we need something from you first!
 
Around $5,000 of the $7000 we are trying to raise will go directly to our initial order of parts from our supplier including wheels, bearings, bushings, trucks, decks etc. and the cost of production. The remaining $2,000 will go towards paying artists, and printing their designs onto our decks. This is just about the bare minimum, any more is greatly appreciated as it will allow us to grow more quickly.
 
If we do not raise the necessary funds,we will simply try again. Maybe take out a loan, maybe try a different crowd funding site, or maybe even have a big garage sale! The point is, this is truly our dream and we will stop at nothing until we accomplish it.
 
We have taken this idea as far as we can by ourselves, and are now asking for your help to make our dream a reality! We have gotten the necessary tax forms, registered with the state and lined up suppliers. All we need now is funding, and we will be ready to start a new, highly profitable, chapter to our lives. Our futures lie in your hands!
If you cannot afford the $10 minimum but still want to contribute, we will make sure to send you a great thank you email! Anything helps! Share with your friends and family!

went searching for a home in which to make and exhibit cutting-edge
contemporary art. They stumbled across an abandoned sewing machine factory
showroom, fell in love with this crazy beautiful space, and thus, BOX 13 was
born.  Now, after six years of
world-class programming in this quirky brick building in the East End, we’re facing new challenges and embracing
new opportunities!  But we need to
get from ‘HERE’ to ‘THERE’ and we need $15,000 <u>now</u> to help us do it.</p>
<p>When it started, nobody could have foreseen the massive impact
that BOX 13 would have on Houston’s cultural life, on the careers of the
artists it has supported and presented, or on Houston’s artistic
community. It’s become the ‘multi-disciplinary art center that
could’,
a wildly adventurous space run by its resident artists (without a staff!!!!)
and hosting some of the edgiest exhibits in the city.</p>
<p><u>NONE</u> of this could this have happened without you. In 2013
we saw the need for increased support to help maintain our home at 6700
Harrisburg, and Indiegogo supporters (sound familiar?) helped us to succeed in
raising over $9,000 (which is amazing!!!) but costs have gone up and our
funding needs have gone up with them. 
The fact is that without your support, BOX 13 will be forced to relocate
or significantly restrict its mission. But. . .but. . . but . . .(and this is
the important part) with your help, we are confident that we can meet - even
maybe exceed - our goals again. </p>
<p>In just six years, we have exhibited amazing work from hundreds of
local Houston artists, not to mention others from the US and around the world
(remember that show we presented from the Netherlands? What about the one from
London?)  We’ve shown
established artists, emerging artists and piles and piles of extraordinary work
in our four exhibition spaces, and collaborated with some of the best arts
organizations in Houston.  </p>
<p>We’ve mounted as many of four independent shows a month (which
with a little math works out to the work of more than 350 artists!!!) The
medium doesn’t matter as much as the idea.  BOX 13 has shown painting, installation, video, sound,
sculpture, photography, ceramics, printmaking, drawing, fibers, and
performance.</p>
<p>Here’s just a short list of some of the collaborative
efforts BOX 13 has undertaken with other arts organizations:</p>

<p>With your support, the artists who call BOX 13 home will be able
to continue presenting Houston with groundbreaking, challenging and exciting
work from home and afar.</p>
<p>BOX 13 is a cultural hub. 
It is unique and vitally important to Houston’s art community.
Together we have transformed an old sewing factory into a humming incubator of
art and design. And we need you to keep it humming with us.</p>

many more to come!</p>

In Relation: A Project on Sharing Stories of Women Through Art
Collaborators: Lindsay Carron and Courtney Belle Branch



What do you love about being a woman?  This is one of the five questions Courtney Branch and I ask to women all over the world in our project called “In Relation”.  ”In Relation” is an initiative that utilizes portraiture and art to cultivate relationships with women across cultures and convey their stories for the purpose of empowering and uplifting.  We believe that every woman’s story matters.  We wish to create art that speaks to the human condition and acts as a conduit for communication and connection.  As we share the portraits and narratives across borders, these women’s stories are able to have an impact now and in the future.
The portraits and the stories are available for purchase in the form of  10x12” fine art prints signed by the artists.  The sale of the portrait acts as a donation to the organization that serves the particular woman depicted in the artwork.  
New Beginnings Rehabilitation Center: Vicente Guerrero, Baja California, Mexico
January, 2014
Courtney and I worked for two weeks with women at a rehabilitation center called New Beginnings in Vicente Guerrero, Baja California, Mexico.  We spent time with these women, learning the stories about domestic violence, sexual abuse, slave trade, drug and alcohol abuse, and physical assault.  We depicted the women in hand-drawn portraits and gifted these to them.  We painted murals of the portraits on the center’s walls.  We came back to the United States with prints of the portraits and the women’s stories to share, in hopes that they can inspire other women and men around the world.
Here are the heroes we got to know at New Beginnings:

Karla: Age 21, Children: Stacy, 3 months old



Maria Magdalena: Age 30, Children: Neli Guadalupe, 5 years old, Rodolfo Manuel, 14 years old


Silvia: Age 24, Children: Abram, 2 years old, Ramiro, 4 years old


Jaira: Age 24, Children: Esmerelda, 4 years old, Joselin, 7 years old, Daleyssa, 8 months old


Maria Soledad: Age 25, Children: Esmerelda, 9 years old, Aurora, 2.5 years old, Misael, 6 months old


Elvia: Age 34, Children: Luz Amayrani, 15 years old, Jesus Daniel, 8 years old

<p>Hullo Everyone</p>
<p>We are Out of Site, Chicago and we have been creating public performance in Wicker Park and Bucktown for three years. We want to bring culture to everyone and the idea was to activate abandoned spaces in the neighborhood on a Friday night from 5pm to 7pm as people come home from work at the weekends. If you've spotted an opera singer singing in the shower at Six Corners or a dance company performing in the Polish Triangle that is us. We bring culture to everyone curating a rich and diverse program of dance, theater and performance art!</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Our Wish List for 2013</p>
<p>We are looking to provide more financial assistance to our international artist Ieke Trinks who needs more money for materials for her performance. Part of our mission is to provide a sustainable economy for everyone working on the project from the stewards, editors and volunteers so if we reach our goal of 5000 we will be paying people for their hard work.</p>
<p>If you support our campaign over $20 you will receive a Do you believe in wonder? t-shirt, a dvd of last years short films, a OoS 2013 poster and if you donate over a $500 you will receive a limited edition print of a photo from a performance of your choice printed on archival paper at the best quality printer in town.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal the money will go to funding the International Artist and paying for documentation of the project but we hope you will support Chicago Performance Art Community and help us reach our goal!</p>

Today we are asking our worldwide communities to support “<b>A Bus for the Gagá la Ceja” </b>campaign by following very simple
steps. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We are raising money to buy a school bus/guagua for organizers of Gagá La Ceja to use for cultural ceremonies during holy week and beyond""</span></p>
<p>
This year we want to invite you to build together with our collective TINGO: Grita
Fuerte an international bridge of love in the sugar field in the Dominican
Republic, La Romana by generating $15,000. This money will be used to buy a bus
that will be used to make possible a yearly Ancestor’s Ceremony in the Sugar
Field where a pure manifestation of unity between Haitian and Dominican
brothers and sisters take place. We believe in the importance of building sustainability and this bus will allow the organizers of this ceremony in the Dominican Republic generate money throughout the year that is needed to sustain this ceremony yearly.</p>
<p>How? This bus will have three uses: </p>

<p>When TINGO: Grita Fuerte’s
Co-founder Nathalie Tejada visited her country the Dominican Republic after 8
years of having migrated to the United States, New York, she was invited to El
Gagá de la Ceja by her friends. During her participation she saw the abundance
of love, smile and happiness in this celebration but she also became present to
many of the limitations that can stop such celebration from happening. As a
result, when she came back to New York with the help of other members,
organizers, and artist, started sending monetary support but the need
prevailed.<span>  <b>To find sustainable solutions,</b> today we are choosing Indiegogo to register all of you into <b>the possibility</b> to transform this town
by <b>opening up unlimited possibilities for
growth.  <br/></b></span></p>
<p><b>What is a Gagá??</b></p>
<p>Gagá de la Ceja is a <b>spiritual/religious</b>
ceremony that takes place in a Batey in the Dominican Republic. Batey (in these
times) is what we call the villages that are in the sugarcane fields. These
villages are populated mainly by the people who work in the sugarcane fields,
most of them are Haitian citizens and Dominicans of Haitian descent. The
families that live in the Batey receive their income from working in this
factories called, sugarcane fields. The level of poverty in the Batey is high due
to the lack of opportunities, discriminatory policies, not a having legal
status, working conditions, among other factors. <br/></p></span><h2><span><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FdHK5tXmLA3k%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DdHK5tXmLA3k&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FdHK5tXmLA3k%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p></span></h2><h2><span><p></p></span></h2><span>

<p>My mom, Kristine Cammisa, had purchased a used 1994 Buick LaSabre from her mechanic back in 2004 and the car is about 20 years old now. We did our best to keep it well-maintained despite the struggles we faced living on her small disability income. In 2006 my mom was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer after having beaten breast cancer 8 years prior. In 2008 I graduated from college and immediately came home to care for her, but unfortunately the cancer had spread to her brain and the treatments were no longer effective. I kept her home and tried to keep her comfortable until the day she passed away on June 11, 2009. She was my only true family, my best friend and my rolemodel. When she died I was completely devestated and I still suffer post traumatic stress from seeing her slowly deteriorate and finally pass on.</p>

<p>My 1994 Buick LaSabre.</p>
<p>A day or two after she passed, the HUD Saratoga Springs Housing Authority told me I had to move out of the apartment by June 30th so they could rent the unit to another family. I had less than two weeks to get out and no time to grieve or really process what was happening at the time. I had to give up my two cats and my dog, give away most of my mom's things, and move into another HUD apartment complex for elderly and disabled individuals. I had very little money to live on as well as my mom's funeral bill and other expenses looming over me. I barely managed to survive on $250 a month along with foodstamps and medicaid. I was only 23 when that all happened and I had to grow up very quickly and learn to survive on my own. I have been struggling with poverty ever since, seemingly unable to work my way up or pull myself out of its maw despite having a college degree and plenty of ambition to work.

My mom, Kristine Cammisa, had purchased a used 1994 Buick LaSabre from her mechanic back in 2004 and the car is about 20 years old now. We did our best to keep it well-maintained despite the struggles we faced living on her small disability income. In 2006 my mom was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer after having beaten breast cancer 8 years prior. In 2008 I graduated from college and immediately came home to care for her, but unfortunately the cancer had spread to her brain and the treatments were no longer effective. I kept her home and tried to keep her comfortable until the day she passed away on June 11, 2009. She was my only true family, my best friend and my rolemodel. When she died I was completely devestated and I still suffer post traumatic stress from seeing her slowly deteriorate and finally pass on.

My mom and I at my college graduation.

My 1994 Buick LaSabre.
A day or two after she passed, the HUD Saratoga Springs Housing Authority told me I had to move out of the apartment by June 30th so they could rent the unit to another family. I had less than two weeks to get out and no time to grieve or really process what was happening at the time. I had to give up my two cats and my dog, give away most of my mom's things, and move into another HUD apartment complex for elderly and disabled individuals. I had very little money to live on as well as my mom's funeral bill and other expenses looming over me. I barely managed to survive on $250 a month along with foodstamps and medicaid. I was only 23 when that all happened and I had to grow up very quickly and learn to survive on my own. I have been struggling with poverty ever since, seemingly unable to work my way up or pull myself out of its maw despite having a college degree and plenty of ambition to work. I have worked several minimum wage jobs just to pay my rent, car insurance, gas, phone and internet which are all necessities. I currently work for an HVAC company and only make $420 a month plus commission, but after I pay my bills I am left with $33 to live on. It's just enough to pay my rent and bills, but nothing more. The only way I manage to get by is by doing freelance art on the side, but it is a very inconsistent and unreliable income.

<h3>Who we are</h3>
The Joseph Boshier Collective is a collaboration between film makers, Ivano Darra,  and Walter Reed and artist Lesley Hilling.  We are putting on an exhibition at the Standpoint gallery in November presenting the life and times of modernist architect and outsider artist, Joseph Boshier.  The show will include a twenty minute documentary film about Boshier.<br/>We are using architect and outsider artist, Joseph Boshier as a device to explore the changing face of our cities.  Our project also probes outsider art investigating marginalised artists who are driven to produce masses of work with little or no care for the commercial art world.</div>

<h3>The Enigmatic World of Joseph Boshier</h3>
<em>'Fiction enables us to grasp reality and at the same time that which is veiled by reality'</em>  Marcel Broodthaars</div>
<div>On Wednesday September 29th 1948 the first two floors of Chesney Court buckled and the ten storey concrete structure collapsed leaving three dead and forty seven injured. Ten years earlier the building was proclaimed as a breakthrough in design and construction, the collapse of the building shook the architectural world and the public at large. Although the subsequent inquiry could find no obvious<span class=""text_exposed_show""> reason for the disaster, the press singled out the architect, Joseph Boshier for blame. Boshier had a love hate relationship with the press, due partly to his brief involvement with fascism. He had been a successful London architect with several small but impressive projects behind him - now his career was in ruins.<br/> After a nervous breakdown and estrangement from his wife and child Joseph became a virtual recluse. He disappeared from the architectural scene and was forgotten.<br/><br/> On his death in 1982 his south London home revealed a staggering trove of intricate wooden sculptures and a mass of drawings and writings. Labyrinthine, oppressive, dark, narrow and magical, his home was stuffed full of collected artifacts and ephemera. The once revered and public figure had retreated into a self imposed exile, solidifying his existence in his small terraced house in Camberwell.<br/> Subsisting for decades on a tiny income, he had produced a series of extraordinary sculptures, collaging new forms out of salvaged wood - often using his own floorboards and furniture and re-working them with an obsessive joinery. These works are the key to uncovering the real Joseph Boshier.</span><br/>The collective has ascertained the whereabouts of most of Boshier's work and this will be displayed along with other evidence of his existence, like his prolific diaries and ephemera from his workshop.<br/>Boshier may or may not have existed. This is for the public to decide.</div>
<div>
<h3>The exhibition</h3>
The exhibition at the Standpoint gallery <a href=""http://www.standpointlondon.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.standpointlondon.co.uk</a> in November will show many of Boshier's wooden artifacts from his small wall pieces to his large standing towers.  The show will also include documents and photographs from his life as an architect, his prolific diaries and ephemera from his home. <br/>There will also be a twenty minute documentary that traces the life of Boshier, called 'The Uncovering of Joseph Boshier'.</div>
<div>The exhibition will spill over into Shoreditch library where a display will focus on the ideals and politics behind architecture and housing between and just after WW2.<br/>We will  be inviting young people from Hackney Community College and the Shoreditch Trust to come to the gallery for several artist led talks:  why we came up with the idea of the Boshier project: how we got it to work and where we intend to take it in the future.  <br/>Artist, Hilling will explain how the work has been assembled and the ideas behind it.  Film makers Darra and Reed will talk about creating a small film - writing a script, casting, finding locations, filming and editing.  We are also inviting people from other professions to talk about 'the idea', because that's what Joseph Boshier is, an idea.  How engineers, architects, designers, photographers get ideas and then manage to take them further.  We want, above all to enthuse the young people that come to the show and talks.</div>
<div>
<h3>The documentary film</h3>
Similar to “Arena” and  “The Southbank Show” and BBC4 documentaries fronted by young academics, it features the voice and archive films of Boshier's daughter, Constance Ripley who, sadly, is now deceased.  In 1983 she gave an interview on Radio London talking candidly about the discovery of a father whom she had believed dead for most of her life. <br/>Dr Derval Tubridy takes the role of cultural commentator and friend of Boshier. <br/>Turbridy is a Senior Lecturer in English Literature and Visual Culture at Goldsmith’s college. She introduces Joseph, narrates his story with the help of other people who knew Joseph and experts on architecture, housing and outsider art.</div>

<h3>Artist Residency at Babayan Culture House</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Hello—I was recently selected to be an artist-in-residence this September at Babayan Culture House in Cappadocia, Turkey! I am thrilled to have the opportunity to focus on textiles and photography while living in this surreal cavernous environment. I am especially looking forward to learning from the local artisans within the village, ensuring this cultural exchange will have a profound and lasting effect on my creative practice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                 <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/772606/pictures/full/20130423120613-IMG_9246.jpg?1366743979"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p>                 <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/713140/pictures/full/20130319132721-IMG_9071sm.jpg?1363724846"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>                 Examples of woven jewelry</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My strong interest in fiber arts originated while traveling through the Sacred Valley region of Peru. I was instantly awestruck by the array of vibrant woven textiles, and I returned to New York determined to learn how to weave. I have since been working on my technique for two years, focusing on small textile pieces that can be worn as jewelry. This residency will afford me time and resources to continue developing my pieces, specifically in experimenting with natural fiber dyeing and implementing new textures and patterns in my designs. I am excited to see how these new surroundings and culture will influence what I think is possible. Although I will center most of my work on weaving, my photographic nature will not allow me to keep the camera down! Accordingly, I will be photographing a series inspired by Cappadocia’s extraordinary atmosphere.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                 <img alt=""Cappadocia's natural tufa formation"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/707354/pictures/full/20130315163715-cappadocia_17.jpg?1363390642"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>                 Cappadocia's surreal stone formations</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Weaving is especially important to me because I feel I am carrying on a piece of my family’s heritage. Throughout my childhood my grandmother introduced me to a wide range of art projects, sharing with me the importance of individual expression through craft. It wasn’t until I returned from Peru that I learned she had been an avid weaver. I like to think my grandmother would be pleased with my textile pieces. And although she and I never had the chance to weave together, her unique tapestries hanging on my wall inspire me to be free and experimental in what I create.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                  <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/707351/pictures/full/20130315163503-grandma_at_loom.jpg?1363390508"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>                   My grandmother at her loom</p>
 
<p>This residency is an incredible opportunity to merge my creative ideas with new influences, and I am honored to be able to take part in such an experience. Having the support of family and friends (and strangers!) is invaluable, and I am so grateful to all who contribute to and share my project.</p>

<div> </div></div>","Artist Residency at Babayan Culture House
 
Hello—I was recently selected to be an artist-in-residence this September at Babayan Culture House in Cappadocia, Turkey! I am thrilled to have the opportunity to focus on textiles and photography while living in this surreal cavernous environment. I am especially looking forward to learning from the local artisans within the village, ensuring this cultural exchange will have a profound and lasting effect on my creative practice.
 
                 
                
                 
 
                 
                 Examples of woven jewelry
 
My strong interest in fiber arts originated while traveling through the Sacred Valley region of Peru. I was instantly awestruck by the array of vibrant woven textiles, and I returned to New York determined to learn how to weave. I have since been working on my technique for two years, focusing on small textile pieces that can be worn as jewelry. This residency will afford me time and resources to continue developing my pieces, specifically in experimenting with natural fiber dyeing and implementing new textures and patterns in my designs. I am excited to see how these new surroundings and culture will influence what I think is possible. Although I will center most of my work on weaving, my photographic nature will not allow me to keep the camera down! Accordingly, I will be photographing a series inspired by Cappadocia’s extraordinary atmosphere.
 
                 
                 Cappadocia's surreal stone formations
 
Weaving is especially important to me because I feel I am carrying on a piece of my family’s heritage. Throughout my childhood my grandmother introduced me to a wide range of art projects, sharing with me the importance of individual expression through craft. It wasn’t until I returned from Peru that I learned she had been an avid weaver. I like to think my grandmother would be pleased with my textile pieces. And although she and I never had the chance to weave together, her unique tapestries hanging on my wall inspire me to be free and experimental in what I create.
 
                  
                   My grandmother at her loom
 
This residency is an incredible opportunity to merge my creative ideas with new influences, and I am honored to be able to take part in such an experience. Having the support of family and friends (and strangers!) is invaluable, and I am so grateful to all who contribute to and share my project.

I am a senior Fiber Major at the Kansas City Art Institute, and I have recently been offered the opportunity to spend a semester abroad studying at the University of Tasmania. As a mixed media textile artist, this experience will be a priceless addition to my academic and artistic growth. Exploring the impact of social constructs on traditional societies through the study of displacement, assimilation, and conquering of adversity is how I seek to find comprehension of self in my artwork. The exploration of traditional cultures fuels my work, and finding my relation to others is the outcome.</p>
<p>After a brief art history lecture on the plight that was the modern day aborigine, I began to research them as peoples. I found that my displacement from Haiti to the U.S. as a child was the strength within my art; this paralleled the displacement of the aborigine people, which only illuminated the strength they had within their beliefs. My forced assimilation back into a family structure that I did not understand mirrored their forced assimilation into white contemporary Australia, which, in many ways, taught them that understanding one another's differences was most important. Understanding each other and our differences is what strengthens us as a society. When I was a young child, my grandmother used to say to me: ""Bay kou, blye; pote mak, sonje."" [You] give a blow, [and you] forget; [yet if you] bear [the] scars, [you will] remember.</p>
<p>These words resonated within me when I realized that we were in the position of those who bore the marks. Understanding came with the mark bearing, and it was essential to our forgiveness and transcendence. Those who were on the other side of the spectrum did not have those experiences, and therefore did not have that understanding. The impact of social constructs on traditional societies became the basis of my fiber art and has developed into the concept of my senior thesis.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am requesting monetary support that will allow me to embark on this journey. The funds for this project will cover the plane ticket and room and board. All donors will receive a hand written letter of thanks and an original work of art from yours truly. If you cannot donate, please consider sharing this link to spread the word. Every little bit helps!</p>

<h2>Fontaine Playing Cards - finally available, with your help.</h2>
<p>On October 10th I posted a Youtube video for a card magic effect of mine titled Marbles - in this video I used a deck of cards that had not been seen before. Simple, minimalistic, and streamlined. The deck did not have a title, nor did anyone know where it had come from, or who made it. This is where the intrigue began.</p>
<p>My name is Zach Mueller - I am a young old magician and sleight of hand nerd from Los Angeles, and this was simply a back design that I put together one night in photoshop - I used two letter 'F's in the same font as my first card magic release, 'Fontaine'. I wanted the design to resemble Wynn Casino Playing Cards and Jerry's Nugget Playing Cards, with a hint of Fontaine for fun.</p>
<p>I had a prototype deck made, used it in a video, and the intrigue ensued. I kept posting videos, using these cards, but offering no information about them. I didn't want people to lose the mystery that surrounded this deck.</p>
<p>Hundreds of comments, tweets, facebook messages asking, ""Where did you get the that deck??"". These commenters saw that the font on the cards was the same as in my effect 'Fontaine', and they named it themselves. The Fontaine Deck.</p>
<p>Two months ago I decided that if all these people wanted the deck, they would never stop asking. It was time to take this from a fun prototype deck I had made for my own enjoyment, to a real, full fledged product that people could actually own for themselves.</p>
<p>In those two months, the Fontaines now have a custom ace of spades, jokers, ad card, seal, and even a custom box with a utility device for magicians <em>built into the design</em>. I've pimped out the prototype you see in the trailer above as much as I can - I'm only one step away from making this deck of cards a reality. I need your help to do that.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>The Deck Itself</h2>
<p class=""p1"">The Fontaines started with just a back design. Now, every deck will come with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Stock &amp; Finish - printed on classic bicycle stock with linen finish, perfect for cardists and magicians alike.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Ace of Spaces - simple, streamlined and elegant. Featuring the fontaine box logo running through the center of the Spade.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Jokers - also sporting the box logo with the fontaine F for pips.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Ad card - fontaine box logo in the center, text which reads 1 of 2500 and first edition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Blank Facer - a card for magicians, to use in various effects including an upcoming Wire release.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Seal -  not shown in the trailer or product shots, but the vector art of the seal can be found in the gallery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Box - with a utility device for magicians <em>built into the design</em>. My friend Michael Stern and I developed a concept called the Vintage holdout 4 years ago that is a slight alteration you make to a card box that opens the doors to TONS of amazing tricks - the downside is only works with these Vintage Series bicycle decks. Until now. I built the same method right into the box design.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">The Goal</span></h3>
<p>Starting today - right now - you can purchase the Fontaine deck. Only 2500 Red Fontaine decks will be made - ever. This is your chance to get your hands one a deck, a pair, a brick, an uncut sheet and many more unique perks all listed to the right.</p>
<p>We need to reach our goal of $10,000 to make these decks a reality. This a fixed funding campaign, meaning if you purchase any of our perks and we don't reach our goal of $10,000 within 30 days - you will get your money back.</p>
<h2 class=""p2"">The Pricing</h2>
<p class=""p1"">Every perk on the campaign includes free shipping within the USA, so if that $12 price tag on one deck scares you, realize that it's going to cost me anywhere from $3-5 to ship that one deck in an envelope to your doorstep. And also the price of the envelope. So that's included if you live in the USA. </p>
<div>
<p class=""p1"">If you're thinking $12 bucks even with shipping is still a lot, I agree. The more decks you buy, the cheaper the price, so get your costco mentality and buy in bulk. Or don't. It's really up to you.</p>
</div>
<h2 class=""p1"">International Shipping </h2>
<h3 class=""p1"">IMPORTANT: If you live outside the USA you MUST add $8.00 at checkout, or I won't be able to ship out your decks. I know, international shipping sucks. Sorry guys.</h3>

<p>Hi, we’re the Development Team
from Impact Arts, a national community arts charity based in Scotland! Impact
Arts works with people aged 0-100 helping them to use the arts to create
positive lasting change in their lives. In short we come up with creative
solutions to social challenges like improving future life prospects, reducing youth
unemployment and preventing isolation amongst older people.</p>
<p>We’re Crowdfunding £15,000 for
our project The Young Gallery. Based in the East End of Glasgow, it is
Scotland’s first and only space dedicated to exhibiting children’s art work.
92% of children in areas of multiple deprivation do not take part in any arts
activities and in the East End between 30-50% of children are living in
poverty. The Young Gallery is Impact Arts’ vehicle for helping children
experience the importance of creativity and for celebrating their boundless
imaginations!</p>

David Shrigley is Patron of The Young Gallery! David is passionate about
supporting the Glasgow based project having lived and worked in the city since
gaining his Bachelors in Fine Art at the Glasgow School of Art in 1991. 
David said: 
“I became involved with The Young Gallery because I want to
give something back to the city that I live and work in. Through The Young
Gallery, Impact Arts gives a quality artistic experience to 300 children living
in the East End of Glasgow each year, and to over 1000 members of the local
community and I’m excited to be involved with such a brilliant project.
“I’d like to help children in Glasgow to realise the
practical, social and emotional benefits of creating artwork and I’ll be
working with Impact Arts to help The Young Gallery fulfil its aims of
transforming lives and providing a legacy for children in the East End and
across Glasgow.” 
So what does this mean for our crowdfund? Our £50, £100, and
£1000 rewards all include a limited edition invitation designed by David (and
for the £100 +£1000 rewards signed by David!) to an auction event Impact Arts
is hosting in summer 2014. There are only 150 of these special invitations
available so pledge now to avoid disappointment!

We are pleased to announce that people can now lend their social support and online influence by joining our Thunderclap campaign. Thunderclap is a platform through which a message can be promoted through social media utilising crowdsourcing. Instead of asking people to pledge their support financially, the service lets individuals “donate” the use of their social media channels in order to blast one message from multiple sources at the same time, hopefully creating a ripple effect of awareness.

<p>A: Yes but probably your best deal is to get it now.</p>
<p>Q: How do I upgrade?<br/>A: Sadly indiegogo has no good method of upgrading and having you pay the difference with a second perk complicates it to no end.

<h3>What We're Up To</h3>
<p>For the past 11 years, Omaha has been sending a team of slam poets to the National Poetry Slam. In that time, our teams have made it to the 8-team semifinal round twice, have been named Best of the Rest once, performing on Finals Stage, and featuring poets such as Individual World Poetry Slam finalist Dan Leaman and Zedeka Poindexter, who was selectd for the Women of the World Poetry Slam in 2013.</p>
<p>Omaha has a vibrant and thriving poetry scene, hosting the second-largest youth poetry festival in the country with Louder Than a Bomb Omaha, and the bi-annual Great Plains Poetry Pile-Up. It's a wonderful community, and it needs your support.</p>
<p>This year, the National Poetry Slam is in Boston, and we need YOUR help to get there.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Your money will go to support the cost of travel, room, and board in Boston throughout the competition. There will be 80+ teams making the same trip, and members of the team plan on competing in other poetry events tied to Boston, such as the Nerd Slam and the Poetry Decathlon. Your money goes toward making an already talented and gifted group of poets even better, to teach them lessons that they can bring back to Omaha, for both other members of the community and the students that the team members teach.</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
We've got a lot of great perks to offer, as you can see to the right.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>First and foremost, and most affordably, the work of our poets. You can get our chapbook shipped to your door for $8, a digital copy of our album for $10, or for just $15, a physical copy of both our chapbook and album.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>There are a lot of additional perks available beyond that, from custom poems to art and design work from team members, even team shows at venues of your choosing.</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>You'll be sending Omaha's strongest voices in this art form to a place where they can hone and grow their skills, which will enrich Omaha's own artistic community upon their return.</p>
<p>And remember, several of the team members are teachers, so the lessons they learn in Boston will enrich the next generation of poets and artists in Omaha as well.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>How Else You Can Help</h3>
Spread the word! Use the share tools here to let people know about our trip!</div></div>","What We're Up To

Your money will go to support the cost of travel, room, and board in Boston throughout the competition. There will be 80+ teams making the same trip, and members of the team plan on competing in other poetry events tied to Boston, such as the Nerd Slam and the Poetry Decathlon. Your money goes toward making an already talented and gifted group of poets even better, to teach them lessons that they can bring back to Omaha, for both other members of the community and the students that the team members teach.
What You Get
We've got a lot of great perks to offer, as you can see to the right.
 
First and foremost, and most affordably, the work of our poets. You can get our chapbook shipped to your door for $8, a digital copy of our album for $10, or for just $15, a physical copy of both our chapbook and album.
 
There are a lot of additional perks available beyond that, from custom poems to art and design work from team members, even team shows at venues of your choosing.

The Impact
You'll be sending Omaha's strongest voices in this art form to a place where they can hone and grow their skills, which will enrich Omaha's own artistic community upon their return.
And remember, several of the team members are teachers, so the lessons they learn in Boston will enrich the next generation of poets and artists in Omaha as well.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Votive Dance is a Halifax based dance company, founded in 2012 by Kathleen Doherty &amp; Stephanie Mitro to provide more choreographic and performance opportunities for professional dance artists. Votive presented a full length show as a part of the 2012 Atlantic Fringe Festival entitled Wish.Desire.Vow. Other performances by the company include, The Beginning (2012), An ARTful Evening With Votive Dance (2013), In Bloom (2013), In Our Element (2013) and guest performances with Maritime Dance Performance Group (2012 &amp; 2013) and Coastal Dance Theatre (2013).</p>
<p>This campaign is to raise money for Votive's newest project, Shedding Suffixes. Shedding Suffixes is a full length show which will debut at the Neptune Scotiabank Studio Theatre in Halifax on November 2 &amp; 3, 2013. The show features dancing and choregraphy by four local artists: Rhonda Baker, Kathleen Doherty, Stephanie Mitro &amp; Amanda Stafford. Shedding Suffixes is based on a poem written by local, and recently published emerging poet, Chantelle Rideout. </p>
<p>All four members of Votive Dance have been busy in the studio over the last number of months, creating a beautiful show to bring to the Halifax public. The four women share a tremendous love of dance, and need your help in bringing it to life on the stage. By contributing to this campaign you are helping to present new and exciting work, gain exposure for this emerging dance company and enriching the lives of Haligonian audiences. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need to raise about $2000 to cover the costs associated with the show, we are hoping to reach half of that amount through this campaign</li>
<li>The total cost for renting the theatre for 3 days is about $2500. The first day in the theatre is for set up alone, day two is for technical rehearsals and opening night, day three is for the second show and clean up.</li>
<li>Why does it cost so much to rent the theatre? There is a daily rental fee, hourly rates for mutliple technicans, ticket set up and printing fees, and other staff who are paid hourly such as: Front of House Manager, Ushers, Box Office Attendant and a Bar Tender. All of these costs must be covered by Votive Dance.</li>
</ul>

<li>Professional dance is an extremely important part of our city, heck, it's an extremely important part of the world!

<p>Hi.  I'm Jaclyn Spencer, but please, call me Jacki.  I'm an artist, herbalist and writer.  I've been an artist pretty much since my parents let me begin playing with crayons and paper as a toddler, and truly it is what I am even more than what I do.  I began studying herbs as a young woman, first for culinary purposes, and it quickly became a lifelong love affair in all ways, from growing herbs from seed to using them for every possible purpose.  </p>
<p>I began writing in the mid-1990s, first for parenting sites, then for gardening sites.  My work is all over the spectrum, though I keep returning to herbs.</p>
<p>Over the past decade a number of friends have encouraged me to write a book about herbs, but how to best achieve this eluded me until this February when I sat down to draw and decided to draw an herb for every letter of the alphabet.  Now I'm driven to write the text and create a masterpiece of herbal art and knowledge.</p>
With decades of experience in both art and herbalism, and a number of successful articles under my belt, I am ready to take this project to completion, with a little help from my friends.</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
To work on the project effectively, I need materials- paper, ink, etc., for both the digital draft and the hand-crafted finished work, plus the postage for shopping the finished work around to publishers. <br/>The perks are all related to the work- prints of the art from the book, right up to a first pull copy!  Any amount will help keep the ball rolling until the work is ready to be published, so toss your coppers in the pot if you can- $1, $10, $100- it all matters.</div>

<p>Eo Molokaʻi.  Knowing that we have talent here on Molokai - our hui set out to brainstorm about how to build on this largely untapped, extraordinary resource of people and history of this beloved island. An invitation was made and kokua is coming! In the form of a seasoned, committed caring hui of professional artists who have created permanent, world class murals at the Sheraton Helumoa, Waikiki; Hawaiʻi Convention Center; Kaupa, Kalihi Stream; Camp Mokuleia; and the Bishop Museumʻs Pacific Hall. </p>
<p>We on Molokaʻi, will all be working together to create a mural to showcase the talents in the Molokai community. Our work is slated to begin in January 2016 and will be painted in March. You are invited to join in our process affirming this Islandʻs rich stories and the creativity of a generation of folks - it's kupuna-elders, makua-parents, and opio-youth.  </p>
<p>(Enjoy the short video trailer above of our first small project!)</p><p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Mural Project Description</b><br/></p>
<p>Starting in 2016 a Hawaiian-inspired community mural project and educational initiative incorporating island stories, indigenous themes and cultural symbolism will be created through a gathering of artists and creatives from the Molokai community — along with invited mural artists from Oʻahu. The mural will be painted by a team of kanaka maoli artists and a hui of young art students and assistants. Education is an integral component of this effort.</p>
<p>A precursor to the painting of this innovative mural project involved outreach and interface with the local school community on Molokai through the efforts of artist/educator Maile Naehu and Hanohano of Hui o Kuapā - the Loko iʻa of Keawanui Fishpond.  The intention was to build a grassroots arts community of resident and local talent. </p>
<p>As native culture will be highlighted throughout the work done for this important project, kanaka maoli aesthetics and iconography will unify elements that will weave Hawaiian moʻolelo (stories) of reverence and aloha for land, sea and sky, and respect for others. </p>
<p>The goal of this mural is to provide an opportunity to experience, first hand, true community and intergenerational collaboration through the visual arts. This project will offer visitors and residents alike a clear visual voice of the people of Molokai.  The hope is that every one who views the mural will feel, in some way, included in it— we must find ourselves in each other, recognizing one another as family and not strangers.</p><p></p><p>There are four supportive cultural ideologies that will feed into a larger mural theme. They include:</p>
<p>Ho’oko - To set and achieve goals and aspirations. To be a well-rounded community member.</p>
<p>Ho’omana - To elevate energies and activate the mana which connects all living things.</p>
<p>Ho’ola - To give the energy of life to. To heal or live a healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p>Ho’opono - To do what is necessary to be righteous. To behave in a respectable manner.</p><p></p><p>When you contribute to this campaign, your dollars will:</p><ul>
<li>Provide for the necessary tools, art supplies and drafting/construction materials needed to complete the panels/banners;</li>
<li>Support the continuation of traditional Native Hawaiian stories, language, and practices in a contemporary arts environment;</li>
<li>During outreach, inter-generational workshop activities and mural making week provide for transportation (work trucks and vans) food (fresh and locally sourced), and basic accommodations needs for 36 artists, their parent/guardian, and kupuna (they will stay where the mural is being painted);</li>
<li>Support the further development of these newly nurtured youth artists from Moloka'i through a gift of art supplies, a series of follow-up visits, co-created educational initiatives, and community service projects at the grassroots;</li>
<li>Provide for master artist honorariums in collaboration with our local hui to mahalo their creative and intellectual contribution to the process over the course of a year which includes historical research, preparations, sketches, art workshops on Moloka'i, open to the public art classes, onsite mentoring, painting, and mural exhibition.</li>
</ul>
<p>When completed, the mural will consist of (8) 5X8 ft. panels/banners and will measure 40 ft. long by 8ft. tall.  They will present a Hawaiian worldview richly layered and grounded in the lore of this beloved island. <br/></p><p>Ours is a vision of collaboration and shared wisdom as we collectively look at the opportunities and challenges presented by living in an interdependent world today.</p><p><b><b>Mural Project Timeline</b></b></p><p><b><b></b></b></p><p>From October through December 2015 arts integration community classes will be offered for free to public on Molokai. These classes will teach art through media, cultural graphic design and visual arts. This space also serves as a recruitment tool for the mural project. We have just been given the green light to expand from 8 students to 24 who aspire to bringing their creative gifts to the project.</p>
<p>On December 12, 2015 an full day field trip with all the artists on the mural team will take place. Artists will visit sites that are significant to Molokai’s people and learn the mo’olelo (stories) of these places. Aloha ‘Aina will be the theme of many of the stories shared. This will serve as an important piece in the process and allow for further planning and collaboration. </p>
<p>In January 2016 master artists will visit Molokai once again to experience the annual Makahiki ceremonies and festivals. This will serve as a time to better learn and immerse themselves in the people, culture and traditions of Moloka’i. Preparations and conceptual designs will be consulted upon based on what is learned.</p><p></p><p>The mural project week is from March 19-25, 2016. In order to complete a project of this magnitude <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">7 days and nights at Keawanui, a fishpond on the East end of Moloka’i, have been scheduled. A totally immersive mural making process will occur during this time. Shared creative space will guide the group. The panels/banners will be constructed, painted, and displayed for viewing with the cooperation of 36 artists.</span></p><p><b>Collaborators</b></p>

<p><i>Maile Naehu</i></p>
<p>My name is Maile and I am a designer/artist/teacher from Lahaina and now live on Molokai. I have been a hula practitioner for over 30 years and a speaker and educator of 'Olelo Hawai'i, the Hawaiian language for 20 years. I was raised in a family of artists and I raise my children surrounded by the arts coupled with the Hawaiian language and practices as well. My husband, Hanohano is a kia'i loko (fishpond guardian), a paniolo and a hunter. We have 3 beautiful keiki together and Aloha 'Aina is our way of life.</p>
<p>As a fashion designer and owner or Leialoha By Maile. I wish to inspire the lifestyle of simplicity and sustainability as this is our lifestyle. In light of this,  I only use recycled and upcycled t-shirts to fashion each piece. Each shirt is dyed in the stream water that feeds into my home workshop, and dried on the line in my backyard. I especially enjoy gathering and dyeing with Traditional Hawaiian dyes. I also use other non-native plants dyes, alaea(medicinal red dirt), and teas. </p>
<p>I am a Kumu for 'Olelo Hawai'i, Creative writing, Performing Arts, Slam Poetry and Visual Arts. In all of my instruction I embed the Hawaiian language and value system. I am also a graduate of UH-Manoa, Kamakakuokalani, with a B.A in Hawaiian studies. Due to my 6 years in Punana Leo and Kula Kaiapuni, followed by 6 years with Kamehameha schools, both as a Kumu I have become well trained in various teaching philosophies and learning practices. Some of my favorites teaching strategies are founded in native intelligence and traditional learning. Moenaha, Na Honua Maoli Ola, and tribes are my constant influences in curriculum planning. I also write original scripts and some of the hula, oli and mele are composed by myself. I emphasize the great importance in holding on to traditions but understanding that our language and culture are living and always growing.</p><p></p><p><br/></p><p><i></i></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444090983/cqyioxjdffhaumgx49h5.jpg"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p><p><br/></p><div>

We have just been given the green light to expand from 8 students to 24 who aspire to bringing their creative gifts to the project.
On December 12, 2015 an full day field trip with all the artists on the mural team will take place. Artists will visit sites that are significant to Molokai’s people and learn the mo’olelo (stories) of these places. Aloha ‘Aina will be the theme of many of the stories shared. This will serve as an important piece in the process and allow for further planning and collaboration. 
In January 2016 master artists will visit Molokai once again to experience the annual Makahiki ceremonies and festivals. This will serve as a time to better learn and immerse themselves in the people, culture and traditions of Moloka’i. Preparations and conceptual designs will be consulted upon based on what is learned.The mural project week is from March 19-25, 2016. In order to complete a project of this magnitude 7 days and nights at Keawanui, a fishpond on the East end of Moloka’i, have been scheduled. A totally immersive mural making process will occur during this time. Shared creative space will guide the group. The panels/banners will be constructed, painted, and displayed for viewing with the cooperation of 36 artists.Collaborators

Maile Naehu
My name is Maile and I am a designer/artist/teacher from Lahaina and now live on Molokai. I have been a hula practitioner for over 30 years and a speaker and educator of 'Olelo Hawai'i, the Hawaiian language for 20 years. I was raised in a family of artists and I raise my children surrounded by the arts coupled with the Hawaiian language and practices as well. My husband, Hanohano is a kia'i loko (fishpond guardian), a paniolo and a hunter. We have 3 beautiful keiki together and Aloha 'Aina is our way of life.
As a fashion designer and owner or Leialoha By Maile. I wish to inspire the lifestyle of simplicity and sustainability as this is our lifestyle. In light of this,  I only use recycled and upcycled t-shirts to fashion each piece. Each shirt is dyed in the stream water that feeds into my home workshop, and dried on the line in my backyard. I especially enjoy gathering and dyeing with Traditional Hawaiian dyes. I also use other non-native plants dyes, alaea(medicinal red dirt), and teas. 
I am a Kumu for 'Olelo Hawai'i, Creative writing, Performing Arts, Slam Poetry and Visual Arts. In all of my instruction I embed the Hawaiian language and value system. I am also a graduate of UH-Manoa, Kamakakuokalani, with a B.A in Hawaiian studies. Due to my 6 years in Punana Leo and Kula Kaiapuni, followed by 6 years with Kamehameha schools, both as a Kumu I have become well trained in various teaching philosophies and learning practices. Some of my favorites teaching strategies are founded in native intelligence and traditional learning. Moenaha, Na Honua Maoli Ola, and tribes are my constant influences in curriculum planning. I also write original scripts and some of the hula, oli and mele are composed by myself. I emphasize the great importance in holding on to traditions but understanding that our language and culture are living and always growing.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>CADEART – art as a statement for solidarity, integrity, cultural diversity and tolerance </h3>
<p>In times where right populism, racism and national isolation is advancing once again, not only in the United States, but also across Europe, we want to take a stand and set a visible example of the exact opposite – cultural diversity and open minds without prejudices will help us unite.</p>
<p>Therefore we, el Cartel del Arte, are organizing an international Mexican street art festival with representative Mexican artists in collaboration with German mural artists, who are going to create murals in Hamburg and Berlin. From the 17/06/19 – 17/06/25 we will organize paintings all over the city, photo and art exhibitions by our protagonists, traditional markets and a memorable open air. Additionally we will hook up with another art festival in Berlin to paint parts of the old Berlin Wall, that we try to transfer to Hamburg and maybe afterwards to Mexico City as a memorial. </p>
<p>We were able to win some of the best mural artists from Mexico and Germany for our mission.</p>

<p>...will leave a massive footstep in Hamburgs city centre.</p>
<p>There is so much more then the stereotyped portrayals about Mexico. We want to show the real face of the Mexican culture through all its urban and contemporary disciplines. </p>
<p>We team up with local influencers in Mexico like <a href=""http://mercadorama.com.mx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mercadorama</a> and <a href=""http://www.tonydelfino.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">TonyDelfino</a> to build strong relationships to build bridges and fight borders.</p>
</div><div> <h3>Why should you...? </h3>
<p>We know there are plenty ways, next to our project, that could make this a better world. But with your donation you will help us to create a message for cultural diversity, tolerance and solidarity, that is as unique as important! Displayed at the heart of Hamburg and visualized for the public.</p>
<p>If we reach the goal we will be able to</p>
<ul>
<li>buy the flight tickets for the artists from Mexico</li>
<li>cover costs for accommodations and travel of all artists</li>
<li>cover costs for stuff, paint and walls</li>
</ul>
<p>But beside helping us to realize the festival every act of donation will get back an awesome reward as we really appreciate your support. You are going to love them, if you are an art lover and appreciate their works.</p>

<h3>CADEART - El arte como una declaración de solidaridad, integridad, diversidad cultural y tolerancia </h3>
<p>En tiempos en los que el populismo, el racismo y el aislamiento nacional avanzan una vez más, no sólo en Estados Unidos, sino también en toda Europa, queremos tomar una posición y dar un ejemplo visible de lo opuesto exactamente: la diversidad cultural y la mente abierta sin prejuicios nos ayudará a unirnos.</p>
<p>Por lo tanto, el Cartel del Arte, organiza un festival internacional de street art mexicano, con artistas mexicanos representativos y en colaboración con artistas alemanes, donde crearan murales en Hamburgo y Berlín. Del 17/06/19 al 17/06/25 se esta planeando realizar pinturas en toda la ciudad, exposiciones fotográficas y artísticas de nuestros protagonistas, mercados tradicionales y un memorable open air con buena música. Además nos juntamos con otro festival de arte en Berlín para pintar partes del antiguo Muro de Berlín, que tratamos de trasladar a Hamburgo y quizás después a la Ciudad de México como un monumento conmemorativo.</p>
<p>Tuvimos la oportunidad de adquirir algunos de los mejores artistas del street art de México y Alemania para nuestra misión.</p>

CADEART – art as a statement for solidarity, integrity, cultural diversity and tolerance 
In times where right populism, racism and national isolation is advancing once again, not only in the United States, but also across Europe, we want to take a stand and set a visible example of the exact opposite – cultural diversity and open minds without prejudices will help us unite.
Therefore we, el Cartel del Arte, are organizing an international Mexican street art festival with representative Mexican artists in collaboration with German mural artists, who are going to create murals in Hamburg and Berlin. From the 17/06/19 – 17/06/25 we will organize paintings all over the city, photo and art exhibitions by our protagonists, traditional markets and a memorable open air. Additionally we will hook up with another art festival in Berlin to paint parts of the old Berlin Wall, that we try to transfer to Hamburg and maybe afterwards to Mexico City as a memorial. 
We were able to win some of the best mural artists from Mexico and Germany for our mission.

...will leave a massive footstep in Hamburgs city centre.
There is so much more then the stereotyped portrayals about Mexico. We want to show the real face of the Mexican culture through all its urban and contemporary disciplines. 
We team up with local influencers in Mexico like Mercadorama and TonyDelfino to build strong relationships to build bridges and fight borders.
 Why should you...? 
We know there are plenty ways, next to our project, that could make this a better world. But with your donation you will help us to create a message for cultural diversity, tolerance and solidarity, that is as unique as important! Displayed at the heart of Hamburg and visualized for the public.
If we reach the goal we will be able to

buy the flight tickets for the artists from Mexico
cover costs for accommodations and travel of all artists
cover costs for stuff, paint and walls

But beside helping us to realize the festival every act of donation will get back an awesome reward as we really appreciate your support. You are going to love them, if you are an art lover and appreciate their works.
 
We <3 projects in Mexico

With the money we raise during the festival we are going to support charities in Mexico. One of the projects is by the FUNDACIÓN PRO NIÑOS DE LA CALLE who cares about kids from the street.
  Spread the word. Stop the hate!
Share with you friends and family to make our project happen for one of the best causes there might be: TOLERANCE. Who we areWe are members of Mercadorama Europe and Urbanskills. Sons of urban contemporary art who believe in the mind changing power of art. We bring together our networks and forces to build a peaceful protest and counterbalance towards intolerance and disparagement.  We say THANK YOU and Mexico is the shit! - - Spanish Version - -
CADEART - El arte como una declaración de solidaridad, integridad, diversidad cultural y tolerancia 
En tiempos en los que el populismo, el racismo y el aislamiento nacional avanzan una vez más, no sólo en Estados Unidos, sino también en toda Europa, queremos tomar una posición y dar un ejemplo visible de lo opuesto exactamente: la diversidad cultural y la mente abierta sin prejuicios nos ayudará a unirnos.
Por lo tanto, el Cartel del Arte, organiza un festival internacional de street art mexicano, con artistas mexicanos representativos y en colaboración con artistas alemanes, donde crearan murales en Hamburgo y Berlín. Del 17/06/19 al 17/06/25 se esta planeando realizar pinturas en toda la ciudad, exposiciones fotográficas y artísticas de nuestros protagonistas, mercados tradicionales y un memorable open air con buena música. Además nos juntamos con otro festival de arte en Berlín para pintar partes del antiguo Muro de Berlín, que tratamos de trasladar a Hamburgo y quizás después a la Ciudad de México como un monumento conmemorativo.
Tuvimos la oportunidad de adquirir algunos de los mejores artistas del street art de México y Alemania para nuestra misión.

<p>Microdose VR is defining a new medium of artistic expression never before possible.  It combines art, music, and dance into a real-time virtual reality gaming experience.  This project combines custom built software, android's artwork, and several HTC Vive stations  which allows participants to control the world inside the dome.  We’re excited to bring a personal VR experience into a collective experience that everyone can enjoy</p>

<h3>Samskara 360 Immersive Film</h3>
<p>SAMSKARA is a stunning, fully immersive, full dome film of specially designed 360-animations and soundscapes produced in collaboration with Fulldome Lab.  A unique approach combining  digital technology and modern design.  It penetrates the viewer’s entire experience, pushing the boundaries of imagination through specially designed animations and soundscapes.  </p>

<p>Working with his team, Android was able to transpose his art into the 3D world, and you’re able to experience this world inside a state of the art dome staring up into an unending universe that fills your senses to get a visceral experience of not just viewing art but having art explore itself through you.  </p>
<p>Samskara is based on ancient Vedic tales and Sanskrit mantras. A journey through consciousness, beyond the mind, to discover the inner self, Samskara takes the audience from creation, through evolution, corruption, conflict and destruction, to eventual rebirth and a path to enlightenment.  It is easily the most visually and auditorially stunning piece of art we've ever seen to date.</p>

<p>Samskara creates a radical ritual experience which provides you the opportunity of viscerally stepping inside these incredible visionary art pieces - a vast array of  powerful images and symbols with messages built in but in a world so expansive that you can interpret the art in ways that connect uniquely to your subconscious mind.<br/> </p>

<h3>Help Us Bringing it to Burning Man in 2017!</h3>
<p>The project is complete but requires rental and transport of cutting edge projection and sound equipment and a Full Dome Pro Dome rental which will require $15k - $20k.</p>
<p>If you love art, and you enjoy gifting people with an experience they will never forget, your contribution big or small will help bring this to all of our Black Rock Citizens.  Think of it like buying a ticket to a film that has the ability to delight and enlighten your heart and mind and giving that gift of a ticket to as many black rock citizens as you can!   Art needs our support culturally!

</div></div><p>My name is Dennis Caco and I am passionate about cars, racing, and making comic books and in 1998 I helped design Import Tuner Magazine, and combined my love for cars and comics to create Max Boost which was a monthly feature in the magazine.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1590207687/bmkdn7nlhngwbxqsrbse.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>So, after we launched Import Tuner, we realized that Max Boost was a ABSOLUTE HIT with the readers, and MANY people subscribed to the magazine because of Max Boost.  And over the years, the magazine grew, and the Max Boost Fanbase grew with it.</p><p>Now, 22 years later, this car culture has established itself and is as vibrant as ever.  Which is why I decided it was time to bring back Max Boost for the original generation of readers, as well as new fans alike.</p><p>In 2019, we lauched a Volume 1 on another platform to bring Max Boost back!  We put the first 4 years (of 8 years) of Max Boost into a collectible volume and it was a success with over $54,000+ in pre-orders made and over 1000 books sold!</p><p>So now we're back with Volume 2, continuing the story as it was first printed in Import Tuner Magazine!</p><p>So I would hope that you would take a look, and ""back this project"", and help us make this Max Boost, Volume 2 a reality!</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1590207710/gkacqygfnuxttgw9f5hv.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong>THANK GOD FOR THE FANS AND FRIENDS! -</strong></p><p>Despite that all those years I was in hibernation, I received a lot of love.  One of my greatest joys is meeting Max Boost Fans in real life, and / or getting Fan messages.</p><p>In particular, I love getting  messages from those who were too young to drive when they first read Max Boost and now have tuner cars of their own. These stories kept reminding me that I should never have stopped drawing Max Boost- and if Max Boost, Volume 1 is successful -  I can bring Max Boost back for the next generation of tuner fans!</p><p>Even though I took a mental break for over 10 years, inspiration came in an unlikely event.  My younger brother (he's 18 years younger than me) got into the tuner scene (on his own, I had no influence I swear!) and eventually asked me to bring him to the racetrack for the first time.</p><p>And little did he know, combined with support from one of our original Max Boost + Autocannon crew Memo Quibrera, and jumping into Sam Rothschilds Honda Challenge Series championship winning CRX race car for the first time in YEARS - they reignited my need for speed, and my itch to bring Max Boost back!</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1590207756/kmpz5bbkw1pbzxaa7nmj.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3><strong>So why am I on Indiegogo?</strong></h3><p>I put over a decade of my life and sweat into Max Boost.  I invested everything I could to continue to make Max Boost for the people, and pursued the dream furiously.</p><p>8 years into it, in 2006, Everything was going perfect and Max Boost was on a roll.  We got some serious momentum when we partnered with Playmates Toys (the Ninja Turtle Company) to make Max Boost Toys and we were even on our way to landing video games, and a deal for Saturday Morning Cartoons with Warner Bros.</p><p>And then suddenly, the WB contract was cancelled -I hit rock bottom [Lost almost everything, and stopped drawing Max Boost to take a mental break.  I was devastated, as everything seemed to have fallen apart, and the hard work from so many was not actualized.</p><p>And, well, my “short"" mental break ended up being more than 10 years.</p><p>I never stopped believing in Max Boost.  I never stopped loving cars, comics, and this culture.</p><p>So I'm here, to put the control back in my hands - and build a MAX BOOST TEAM with YOU (yes YOU) - to launch more products that YOU WANT TO SEE without needing the studios or big names.  I realized with the power of community, we can actually do this independently.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0704/8305/files/KS51.gif?v=1590203352"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>So Max Boost Volume 2 is the SECOND step of MANY.  So, if this campaign is successful, it will allow us to continue with our NEXT STEPS:</p><ul>

Details will be sent t you.  Date TBD.  MAX BOOST, VOLUME 2:  Filled with 167 pages, and Issues 40-98 which is the the second half of comics (Volume 1 was Issue 1-39) plus never-before-seen art in a gorgeous, collectible hardcover, exclusively ONLY AVAILABLE for pre-order HERE!  Max Boost is a story about Max and Otto, and their adventures in Motorville as they dream of one day becoming racing legends - but first, their stock civic needs more horsepower! :sad trombone:  And, before the dream of going PRO and have their names grace the Motorville Hall of Fame, they may want to be able to defeat their arch nemesis Todd in a quartermile drag race first.  In Volume 2, the story continues with Max and Otto in their stock pea-green civic, as they drag race at IDRC in a hopeless attempt to beat Todd’s V8. When all hope seems lost, Magically, a boost button appears on their dashboard- and of course they decide to push it… and the transformation begins. And from there, the story picks up quick - leading into more races, even more mayhem in Motorville. You’ll have fun meeting a new cast of characters, with new tuner cars, and some more high speed hijinks along the way.  Do you remember the Super Dupra?  The AWD Twins Zig and Zag?  BUT, the world of MAX BOOST is in danger.  Cars are starting to randomly disappear- and mysterious villains from a distant world are out to destroy MOTORVILLE.  The mystical Papa Wheely is the only one who knows the secret to saving Motorville, and why Max Boost has been chosen to become a unlikely hero.  This Volume 2 is full of surprises - and heck - we even have special guest appearances - like this dude you might recognize! So treat yourself to a great story, and a chance to own a rare collectible that is a part of original 90’s Tuner Culture!  And from there, close to 200 total pages of Max Boost have been published to date (Volume 1 and Volume 2 will be the complete story, up to date) about the misadventures  - from tuning upgrades, to police, drag racing, drifting, burnouts and torgue the story takes many twists and turns.Max Boost, Volume 2 is a joy ride for all car enthusiasts and comic book fans! Behind the Scenes and Additional Art Added to the Book!ALSO IN THE BOOK: BEHIND-THE-SCENES AND ART NEVER SHARED BEFORE! Max Boost Volume 1 has 100 Pages of the original comic, plus 50 pages of EXTRAS and never before seen art, original sketches, and more that is only available here on Indiegogo.  And exclusively for this campaign launch, you can get add-ons and exclusive Gifts never offered before (see below)! Max Boost - He is the underdog, and our unlikely hero.  Max is absolutely passionate about cars and racing, and will do anything it takes to find, build, and race the car of his dreams.  His number one enemy is Todd, and he is committed to bringing street-justice to Motorville by having Todd pay for all of the horrible things he does to those who have less horsepower than him.And, as the story develops, we find out what roles these characters play, as the very existence of Motorville may actually depend on this young group of street-rascals...    Otto - is Max's best friend and voice of reason.  Otto is basically the opposite of Max, as he is calm, collected, and is always thinking wisely.  However, he also knows it's almost impossible to stop Max when he has a ""great idea"", and knows it's better just get out of his way (and sometimes more entertaining!).  As a master tactician, Otto, has the skill of gently guiding Max along so he doesn't hurt himself... too much.  Todd -  Big V8, BIG Pistons, and even BIGGER EGO.  Todd is the town jock that you love to hate, and he makes it a ""sport"" to harass Max and Otto, and anyone else under 500 horsepower.  Maybe one day, Max and Otto will be able to teach him a lesson in humility, but they will need to find some horsepower and torque first!  Papa Wheely and his henchmen, Yin, Yan and Wok - He has the Horsepower and Torque!  Papa Wheely is the Proprietor of Papa Wheely's Performance Pagoda.  He's the one to see if you want you tuner car, tuned - but for a PRICE!AND, if you don't make your payments on time, you may end up meeting the his ""Wu Tang Wack!""  Ese and 'Efe - The leaders of the Low Rider crew from Low Co., Ese and Efe' patrol the streets of Lotting Park - with 3 wheel motion, on chrome & white walls.  Don't get caught by them at the wrong time, in the wrong place, or you might find yourself getting ""hit by switches"".  Rip, Slug, Torch- Three mysterious bad dudes from a mysterious place have come to Motorville with suspicious motives.  Are they just looters? Or are the part of a bigger plan leading to the distruction of Motorville?  Let's find out...And, that's not all, there are many, many more characters in Max Boost for you to meet!  We WARNED YOU! -  We SOLD OUT of all collectible Volume 1 Exclusives in the first campaign, so now we're back with NEW items exclusively for Indiegogo SO GET THEM WHILE YOU CAN!!!!

My name is Dennis Caco and I am passionate about cars, racing, and making comic books and in 1998 I helped design Import Tuner Magazine, and combined my love for cars and comics to create Max Boost which was a monthly feature in the magazine. So, after we launched Import Tuner, we realized that Max Boost was a ABSOLUTE HIT with the readers, and MANY people subscribed to the magazine because of Max Boost.  And over the years, the magazine grew, and the Max Boost Fanbase grew with it.Now, 22 years later, this car culture has established itself and is as vibrant as ever.  Which is why I decided it was time to bring back Max Boost for the original generation of readers, as well as new fans alike.In 2019, we lauched a Volume 1 on another platform to bring Max Boost back!  We put the first 4 years (of 8 years) of Max Boost into a collectible volume and it was a success with over $54,000+ in pre-orders made and over 1000 books sold!So now we're back with Volume 2, continuing the story as it was first printed in Import Tuner Magazine!So I would hope that you would take a look, and ""back this project"", and help us make this Max Boost, Volume 2 a reality!  THANK GOD FOR THE FANS AND FRIENDS! -Despite that all those years I was in hibernation, I received a lot of love.  One of my greatest joys is meeting Max Boost Fans in real life, and / or getting Fan messages.In particular, I love getting  messages from those who were too young to drive when they first read Max Boost and now have tuner cars of their own. These stories kept reminding me that I should never have stopped drawing Max Boost- and if Max Boost, Volume 1 is successful -  I can bring Max Boost back for the next generation of tuner fans!Even though I took a mental break for over 10 years, inspiration came in an unlikely event.  My younger brother (he's 18 years younger than me) got into the tuner scene (on his own, I had no influence I swear!) and eventually asked me to bring him to the racetrack for the first time.And little did he know, combined with support from one of our original Max Boost + Autocannon crew Memo Quibrera, and jumping into Sam Rothschilds Honda Challenge Series championship winning CRX race car for the first time in YEARS - they reignited my need for speed, and my itch to bring Max Boost back!  So why am I on Indiegogo?I put over a decade of my life and sweat into Max Boost.  I invested everything I could to continue to make Max Boost for the people, and pursued the dream furiously.8 years into it, in 2006, Everything was going perfect and Max Boost was on a roll.  We got some serious momentum when we partnered with Playmates Toys (the Ninja Turtle Company) to make Max Boost Toys and we were even on our way to landing video games, and a deal for Saturday Morning Cartoons with Warner Bros.And then suddenly, the WB contract was cancelled -I hit rock bottom [Lost almost everything, and stopped drawing Max Boost to take a mental break.  I was devastated, as everything seemed to have fallen apart, and the hard work from so many was not actualized.And, well, my “short"" mental break ended up being more than 10 years.I never stopped believing in Max Boost.  I never stopped loving cars, comics, and this culture.So I'm here, to put the control back in my hands - and build a MAX BOOST TEAM with YOU (yes YOU) - to launch more products that YOU WANT TO SEE without needing the studios or big names.  I realized with the power of community, we can actually do this independently.  So Max Boost Volume 2 is the SECOND step of MANY.  So, if this campaign is successful, it will allow us to continue with our NEXT STEPS:
Max Boost Volume 3
Animation
Toys
Netflix Show? :)
AND MORE....
Like my own life, Max Boost is a true Underdog story, where you're put up against all odds and still have to find a way to succeed.  Max Boost was simply a dream, and though hard work, long nights sleeping under drawing tables, and being a starving artist (literally), I was able to create something that fans worldwide loved. Max Boost is perfect for all gear heads, tuners, and comicbook fans looking for something that has deep roots and history in the Car Culture Or anyone who just love anime, cars, high speed hijinx, and a good ol' underdog story about a little hatch back “that could"".So this is where YOU come in...Max Boost is ONLY available here, at a discount, with Bonuses in hopes you will become part of the Max Boost Fam reserve your very own limited first edition copies, today,Simply click below to ""Back this Project"" to keep this dream alive!Please contribute today, share with your friends, and become part of Team Max Boost!Drive Fast. Race Hard.Dennis Caco & Memo Quibrera, Marat Zabelinskiy, Dan Wilson, and the Max Boost Crew I could NOT have done this without so many people through the last 20 years and need to say THANK YOU!  (I am SURE I am forgetting a bunch of people, so please bear with me as I edit this from time to time)Of course, I need to start with my original ""Racerette"" and my wife Rachelle, and my son, Drake ""Max"" Caco, (yes his name is Max!),  and my very patient Mom, Dad my brothers Allan and Eric, and my super-sister Joann and her family.And of course, this would have never have happened without Albert Estacio and Collier Mclennan (Online Performance) convincing me to be the first DRAG GEN II Turbo Kit car for Herman Chan, and subsequently meeting Michael Ferrara from Turbo Magazine (now publisher of DSPORT), to shoot my Black Turbo Intergra GS-R  for a magazine feature back in 1995.From there I met published Kipp Kington (RIP) and the team at IGC - Ed Eng, Evan Griffey, and that crew that invited me to help them design a brand new magazine from scratch, which eventually became Import Tuner.  (I designed the original logo, cover concepts, and helped create the theme for Import Tuner).  Those were good 'ol days!So that's the beginning ...And since then I have met (and need to thank) so many friends and family:My number ones - my wife Rachelle and son, Drake ""Max"" CacoMemo Quibrera, Allan Deguzman, and Sam Rothschild for inspiring me to get back to the racetrack and bring Max Boost back to life.Sponsors: My studio and comic peeps:Nghia, Derek, Clydene Nee, Batton Lash, Joe Philips, Lex Wolfcraft, Chris NeuhahnCo-Workers and Friends; Memo Quibrera, Marat Zabelinskiy, Nick Coleman, April Estrada  Rich Langi, Carter Jung, Rick, Andres the Car Kid, Wes Walz, Artists and assistant artists:Rich, Jasen, Nghia, Eddie, Ray, Melissa, Derek, Conrad, Trace My OG race team:Sam Rothschild, Dan Wilson, Lee Lim, Ian Penaflorida and Family, Gabe, Tim T.Ground Zero Racing and Online Performance, Eddie from Dynamic Autosport and Ha (RIP) from Pann Autosport for being my very first retail customers in the mid 90's Influencers & social partners:

Revised budget & fund needs! So, a friend at a local tool vendor who knows of the project (Thanks Mike!) let me know of a promotion of a medium sized CNC-Router that includes a laser module! That's like a $850 value and free included shipping (with the CNC). It also includes some basic software that can be upgraded at reduced cost which will cut my requirement in half! This saves the cost of the laser & software and quite a bit in shipping! But I need to get an order in soon – actually before the end of the campaign. Here's the new system: Revised System:HD4 Medium bed CNC                      $4,500.00 Can be upgraded in the futureV-Carve Software                                   $500.00 Upgrade to V-Carve Pro & Photo CarveLaser Engraver Head                              $0.00! Included! (an over $850 value!)Wood Allotment:                                  $500.00 Still need stuff to cut!Ideal Project Total:                          $5,500.00 (under 1/2 of “ideal” system) We have less than 18 days  left! And to make make this revised system possible, we need to raise a bit over $2,600. Basically we need to double what we've received so far. So to help get this in gear in the home coming stretch – Michelle and I have agreed to add a new perk at the $50 mark – a custom coffee cup, featuring our new logo! The Back Story . . . .I am a father of two wonderful little kids.They are growing up well, kind, and joyful (and some times just a little too much energy – but that's good, right?). I'm married to a wonderful lady who is as smart as she is beautiful. I've dedicated my professional life to ministry, non-profits, and providing care for others. In many ways, I had a really good life. And I still do. But I became sick. It started with a little fall. Easy to pass off at the time as a little too much work and not enough sleep. But I kept falling. I also have started to bump into things. At times, it feels like my feet are stuck to the floor and it's hard to move. And finally the hand shaking started.Then there are the sweats. The agitation. At times its hard to put words to my thoughts. I have started to find it harder and harder to be in groups of people or out in public. Especially where I have to speak. Many times now, I have my wife order for me at restaurants, bless her. A pair of referrals to two different specialists finally pinpointed what's been going on. I have Parkinson's Disease compounded by Panic Disorder. The combination has made functioning as a minister impossible. While it was clear that I was becoming sicker, what wasn't clear was how I would care for my family. Through some blessed souls in my denomination, I've been granted disability and released me from ministry. When I heard those words, a huge weight was lifted off my heart. The denomination (Board of Pensions, PCUSA) has agreed to take care of me in my sickness and they give us a stipend for living expenses. It's not a lot but it's enough for daily needs for my family. First off, thank you for everyone who has brought me this far. Family, friends, co-workers, doctors, clinicians, and church leadership. I am very grateful for you walking through this with me. However, I now have a new problem – what in God's great name do I do with all my free time?I am used to working 50+ hrs a week.Now I have to stay at home for the lion's share of the time.My wife has a career (bless her). My kids go to school. The rest of my family works.My illnesses – between physical limitations and social – makes it hard for me to travel by myself. Now, I find great personal value in creating. So, I need something I can do at home that allows me to create that I hope will have a positive benefit to others as well as my family. I already turn wood, combined with other skills, the thought came to me. So, I'm making a wood shop: ""For Every Season Crafting"". I don't expect to make a full time job of this. I just want something to keep me busy at the house, and I can put away a little extra money for my children's college funds. What do I need?I already have a fairly well outfitted workshop. But to go in this new direction, I need to add an expensive tool to my collection: I need to purchase a CNC Router. And there just isn't extra in the budget with what I receive for disability. Ideal System:Extended-Bed CNC                                   $6,500 .00   A nice work space.Software (3D, 2D, & photo engraver)  $1,000.00   Allows me to draw more on the pc.Shop Computer                                           $1,000.00   A dedicated computer for the CNC.Water Cooled Spindle System                $1,000.00  Allows a longer cutting time (& quieter!)Laser Engraver Head                                  $1,000.00  Allows for engraving photos & shading.Wood Allotment                                           $1,000.00  Wood Stock for crafting.Dust Collection                                                $500.00  Helps keep sawdust out of my lungsIdeal Project Total:                                    $13,000.00This would take just a little over 500 people giving $25!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Giving Tree is a weeping willow tree, to be a sanctuary from the hottest desert days. Where you can mingle with new friends, climb a tree, relax in the shade, maybe even catch a ride to a new destination. Leave your markings and symbols on the tree for others to be inspired along the way. We are here to share stories about our roots and where we've come from and where we are going. Throughout the week as citizens of BRC express their feelings around the trunk and roots of the trees fabric with permanent markers those symbols, words and stories will be told even when the creator has moved on. The week at BRC will bring life to The Giving Tree! Help us bring this dream HOME-)'(-for 2017 Thanks to all who are following/like us.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have already invested. We bought the bus and have constructed our second level deck with safety railings all around. We have 3500 watts of continuous green energy to power all systems which has already been installed and has room to expand. To be able to finish our dream we need your help so we can bring The Giving Tree home to the playa in 2017. Your funding will go to the following.</p>
<p>~ $3000 will achieve our goal for our night lighting plan which consist of 40 RGB 18 watt fiber optics, 200 strands per light at 6 ft long which is going to hang from the branch for a glowing willow vine effect. We plan on 6 RGB 50 watt flood lights for a ground effect under the roots and 12 black lights to create a glow from inside the tree around the upper viewing deck. </p>
<p>~$2000 Will achieve our goal for the day time effect of the willow vines. We will be stringing 40,000 ft of different shades of green parachute cord from the branches to hang like willow vines. These will incorporate with the fiber optic strands to look amazing day or night!</p>
<p>~$2000 Will achieve our goal for the metal we still need to complete the skeleton of the roots and the branches that will support all the willow vines and fiber optic lights. They will be fabricated out of 700 ft of 1 -1/4 inch and 1 inch electrical conduit. Then we will wrap the conduit with 400 ft of chicken wire to sculpt more shape to the branches/roots and to hide the metal skeleton of the branches/roots and light units. We will later wrap brownish fabric around the chicken wire to hide everything and bring the branches/roots to a realistic look.</p>
<p>~$1500 Will achieve our goal to cover all the branches/roots and the trunk of the tree. The tree trunk fabric will be fastened all around the bus to shape the trunk and hide the base vehicle. We will be needing  1500 square feet of brown fabric to cover everything.</p>
<p>~$1500 Will achieve our goal for estimated hardware such as cotter pins to hold all branches and roots in place. It will also cover welding gas, welding wire, metal cutting disc, nuts and bolts, extension cords and electrical wire to hook up lighting and sound. As well as expanding foam for sculpting a face for the front of the tree trunk, brown paint to paint the face and other miscellaneous hardware etc.</p>
<p>~ Check out our awesome perks they are all listed and described on this page.</p>
<p>~ If we don't reach our goal we will have to scale back the ""WOW"" factor by one of several ways... We hope to NOT have to do this with your HELP!!! We will scale back the amount of parachute cord by half. Also we can scale back the lighting as much as possible to still achieve our night license or worst case no lighting at all.... and just a day license. Regardless what happens I will work day and night to get my dream to the playa this year 2017! It's gonna happen even if I have to work 3 jobs! I know I will have the support of my friends, family, and wonderful community of Denver CO burners. All are ready to help get their hands dirty and enjoy a building experience of life! Together we can make any dream a reality. Help us water The Giving Tree Art Car.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With the contributions from all of YOU beautiful people you can help us make one of the most visually stimulating, heart felt experiences the playa has been waiting for. As you walk and climb around The Giving Tree you will see the ""WOW"" factor in our extreme attention to detail. Along the way you will be able to read what others have carved into the fabric by permanent marker. Reading the trees Symbols, Stories, and  Radical Expressions to motivate you to leave your own mark for the future of Radical Rituals. We hope for The Giving Tree Art Car to travel the country and maybe even the world to share the power of GIVING!!!!</p>
<p>Our team has strong roots in building art cars. We have a combined effort with 4 years of mutant vehicles on the playa. In 2013, Jason/team member, crowd funded and build the SS Tittyhawk aircraft carrier art car and brought it to the Playa. We were successful in reaching our goals and the DMV approved us on playa for our day and night license showing that we have an outstanding track record building art cars and meeting our goal and most importantly impressing the community with the art. Without the community coming together we would not be able to achieve these goals and for that we thank you ahead of time.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges </h3>
<p>My team and I have discussed many angles of this project. We have addressed any moop issue and solved it by deciding to use better art material Any weight concerns of the branches and art materials have been taken into consideration for safety and will be structurally sound and securely fastened to the base vehicle. My team and I have gone over our build plan several times to further make it more achievable. Without ever forgetting about the ""WOW"" factor! All successful projects have a plan and I must say my team and I plan to execute this build to the highest degree of excellence. We will approach any challenge knowing there is always a solution... for a better tomorrow. If any risks present themselves we will address them with a full heart to find a reasonable solution. The largest hurdle my team and I face is FINANCIALLY, that is why we are here to ask for your help and support along the way! My team and I have lots of fabricating, welding, sculpting, designing, engineering, and of course artistic backgrounds! Together we will solve any issues we have along the way to make sure the The Giving Tree Art Car makes it to playa for 2017 with all the bells and whistle the team and YOU can think of. We are always open to suggestions.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know not everyone can support financially and that's okay. We plan on scheduling a couple fundraiser get-togethers and also some large build days in an airpot hangar near Denver International Airport. So if you can make it out or you are in the area around the months of June and July, (more info on exact dates will come soon), we would love to meet all of you and share our dream with the community as it brings us together. If the only way you can help is to spread the word of The Giving Tree to friends and family through Facebook and Indiegogo then by all means share it, we love you for any way you can help. If you've been here you know how much effort this takes. Help us set our dream free.</p>
</div></div>","Short Summary
The Giving Tree is a weeping willow tree, to be a sanctuary from the hottest desert days. Where you can mingle with new friends, climb a tree, relax in the shade, maybe even catch a ride to a new destination. Leave your markings and symbols on the tree for others to be inspired along the way. We are here to share stories about our roots and where we've come from and where we are going. Throughout the week as citizens of BRC express their feelings around the trunk and roots of the trees fabric with permanent markers those symbols, words and stories will be told even when the creator has moved on. The week at BRC will bring life to The Giving Tree! Help us bring this dream HOME-)'(-for 2017 Thanks to all who are following/like us.

What We Need & What You Get
We have already invested. We bought the bus and have constructed our second level deck with safety railings all around. We have 3500 watts of continuous green energy to power all systems which has already been installed and has room to expand. To be able to finish our dream we need your help so we can bring The Giving Tree home to the playa in 2017. Your funding will go to the following.
~ $3000 will achieve our goal for our night lighting plan which consist of 40 RGB 18 watt fiber optics, 200 strands per light at 6 ft long which is going to hang from the branch for a glowing willow vine effect. We plan on 6 RGB 50 watt flood lights for a ground effect under the roots and 12 black lights to create a glow from inside the tree around the upper viewing deck. 
~$2000 Will achieve our goal for the day time effect of the willow vines. We will be stringing 40,000 ft of different shades of green parachute cord from the branches to hang like willow vines. These will incorporate with the fiber optic strands to look amazing day or night!
~$2000 Will achieve our goal for the metal we still need to complete the skeleton of the roots and the branches that will support all the willow vines and fiber optic lights. They will be fabricated out of 700 ft of 1 -1/4 inch and 1 inch electrical conduit. Then we will wrap the conduit with 400 ft of chicken wire to sculpt more shape to the branches/roots and to hide the metal skeleton of the branches/roots and light units. We will later wrap brownish fabric around the chicken wire to hide everything and bring the branches/roots to a realistic look.
~$1500 Will achieve our goal to cover all the branches/roots and the trunk of the tree. The tree trunk fabric will be fastened all around the bus to shape the trunk and hide the base vehicle. We will be needing  1500 square feet of brown fabric to cover everything.
~$1500 Will achieve our goal for estimated hardware such as cotter pins to hold all branches and roots in place. It will also cover welding gas, welding wire, metal cutting disc, nuts and bolts, extension cords and electrical wire to hook up lighting and sound. As well as expanding foam for sculpting a face for the front of the tree trunk, brown paint to paint the face and other miscellaneous hardware etc.
