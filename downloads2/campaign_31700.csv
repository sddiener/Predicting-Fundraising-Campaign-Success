<h3><strong>You Can Help Us Make Entrepreneurs and Inventors</strong></h3>
<p>Makersville is a grassroots, inclusive community of creative and technical makers in Long Beach, CA.  Since 2012 we have been working to create programs for youth that involve hands-on learning.  We have a group of committed Makers who have built programs in game design, latex mask making, toy making, programming, sewing, robotics, electronics and more,  using a play based approach that includes creativity triggers and aids like Minecraft, LEGO(r),  the Arduino.</p>
<p>It is through the Maker movement that we understand the need for and benefits of entrepreneurship and invention to provide a focus for learning.</p>
<p>Our makers have a wide variety of skills and life experiences.  Our program format has provided and continues to provide work, entrepreneurship, internship and mentoring opportunities to youth as young as 6 years old, home schooled youth from Great Educational Experiences, high school students and graduates from six Long Beach high schools.  Our makers have and are mentoring high school students in their senior projects.</p>
<p>We realize the need for students today to understand how they can make their own work happen, because we, the adult makers, work to make our own work happen.  We started our entrepreneurship program two years ago, with the hope that our students would make things for sale at a Christmas boutique.  With traditional methods of making things, our students were only able to make single prototypes, ones they wanted to keep!  We still love and want to use the traditional methods for technique and skills learning, but we need a way to create a small-run production capability, so as to give them their next learning opportunities; invention, entrepreneurship, budgeting, marketing and sale of their inventions and designs.</p>
<h3><strong>We need $25,000 to purchase an Epilog Zing 60 Watt Laser Cutter and Materials and to provide space and staffing for regular hours during the school year.</strong></h3>
<p>$25,000 will let us purchase the zing outright.  If we don't get that, we'll take a lease if we are able to get enough to cover the first year's lease payment and program, which we expect to be $15,000.  We are aiming at delivery 8 weeks after our goal is met.</p>
<p>During the school year, we expect the Zing to be housed at the Long Beach Sea Base.  We may take it out to locations where we are spending some time.  During the summer, we will move it to our summer camp location.</p>
<p>The Zing will be available to be used in our classes.  We'll etch patterns into denim and leather, cut paper pieces for cards, make delightful paper models, cardboard and wood models, cut wood and a variety of materials for robot bases, game pieces, puzzles, woodblock prints and project supports.  We'll make wooden gears.  We want to make Da Vinci models and wooden toys, boxes for electronics projects.  Our students will be able to visualize and create something, then do short runs of the items for their entrepreneurial experiences.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We believe in helping others through the creation of sustainable systems anchored in skills learning and making.  We use invention and entrepreneurship as target goals.  We are extremely grateful for having been provided the opportunity to serve youth at two Title 1 Elementary Schools, and we are partnering with onsite scout and the after school program.  We hope to identify ways to help homeless families, a collaboration we're working on with the Scoutreach program of the Long Beach Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America.</p>
<p>Since 2012, we have worked to make a difference in the community in which we live.  We have helped to bring in substantial youth serving communities to the Sea Base and are ourselves one of those communities.  We've made a difference, but now we need your help in making a bigger difference.</p>
<p>We know that a piece of equipment such as this will attract new and different youth, mentors, makers, inventors and artists to our program.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our challenge is to create a viable maker space.</p>
<p>This campaign is our way of addressing that challenge.</p>
<p>The campaign perks, themselves, will ensure our community, as they will provide access to the makerspace and the equipment.</p>
<p>50% of all perks and 100% of donations is earmarked for makerspace equipment. </p>
<p>If we do not reach our minimum goal of $15K within 60 days, purchasers of individual or group makerspace passes will have the option of receiving a refund, using the maker space without the laser cutter, or applying the purchase amount towards a Makersville class.  Purchasers of specific items will still receive their items.</p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>Everyone can help.  A donation of any amount helps but, if you can't contribute yourself, please help us to get the word out by sharing our campaign with as many friends as you can, but especially those who might benefit from one of the perks in our campaign.</p>
<p>Please also remember to use the Indiegogo share tools!</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">This being our second campaign (the first one was on Indiegogo way back in 2016), we are well aware of the risks and challenges of crowdfunding. So this time, we’ve taken extra care and finished off almost everything prior to launching the campaign. We have done a small manufacturing run already to understand and resolve manufacturing challenges, have a decent stock of over 250 units, as a result, are confident of our unit economics, have on-boarded FedEx as our shipping partner, have released stable versions of software, application, online courses etc. For further production, we have the capacity of producing 300-1000 units in a 45-day production run. In short, the team is well aware of what it is promising and is determined to deliver. You can shed your worries and hop on the journey with us :) <br/>We have given you a conservative timeline anyway, factoring in 2-3 weeks of delay in potential bottle-necks already. Despite all of this, if a glitch creeps in, however small, we will keep you updated. Because all that matters, in the end, is that we are able to fulfill our promise and deliver on schedule. <br/>We are happy to launch STEMpedia on Indiegogo and are very much looking forward to having you as our very first batch of consumers. Let us realize the dream of an innovative tomorrow driven by young minds of the present.</p>

In addition to these awesome hardworking people, we have the following people to thank:


धन्यवाद् | We couldn’t be any more grateful to you for believing in us! Now all you have to do is sit back, relax, and get ready for the exciting journey that we’re going to take you on!
In case you have any queries or if you just want to say Hi, drop us a mail at support@thestempedia.com.

1. The evive Starter Kit 2.0 is already into production and has undergone a small batch production to understand and mitigate production and supply chain challenges.
2. The STEM Safari is at 80% completion. Courses on Electronics and Robotics are complete while the course on Programming is still under development. While the content, quizzes, assessments etc. for the course on Programming are complete, videos are yet to be shot, edited and uploaded to the course.
3. PictoBlox has been released as an Alpha for the purpose of demonstrations and gathering reviews for this campaign. We are adding a few more features and making it more stable so as to release the final version by the time of shipping.
4. We released the alpha for the  Android version of Dabble app in Dec 2018, so as to gather reviews and suggestions for improvements. The team is currently working on making such improvements and developing the iOS version for Dabble.
All the constituents are at a stage where they are 2-4 weeks away from stable releases.



This being our second campaign (the first one was on Indiegogo way back in 2016), we are well aware of the risks and challenges of crowdfunding. So this time, we’ve taken extra care and finished off almost everything prior to launching the campaign. We have done a small manufacturing run already to understand and resolve manufacturing challenges, have a decent stock of over 250 units, as a result, are confident of our unit economics, have on-boarded FedEx as our shipping partner, have released stable versions of software, application, online courses etc. For further production, we have the capacity of producing 300-1000 units in a 45-day production run. In short, the team is well aware of what it is promising and is determined to deliver. You can shed your worries and hop on the journey with us :) We have given you a conservative timeline anyway, factoring in 2-3 weeks of delay in potential bottle-necks already. Despite all of this, if a glitch creeps in, however small, we will keep you updated. Because all that matters, in the end, is that we are able to fulfill our promise and deliver on schedule. We are happy to launch STEMpedia on Indiegogo and are very much looking forward to having you as our very first batch of consumers. Let us realize the dream of an innovative tomorrow driven by young minds of the present.
Thank you.

Durante a mesma trajectória, fizemos uma experiência coleccionando garrafas PET vazia junto à crianças da rua, com objectivo de apreender e ensinar como reutilizar garrafas, ajudando a desenvolver uma mente criativa.

Realizaremos o projecto do Jardim com a ajuda que conseguirmos.</p><p><strong>3-Qual é​ o motivo?</strong></p><p>O nosso foco principal é a educação e a saúde das crianças. Nós acreditamos que o desenvolvimento de um país está nas mãos da nova geração.</p><p>Tem se como objectivo a aproximação das crianças à natureza para mudar a direcção do pensar das mesmas , ter a maior atenção nelas porque elas são puras e aprendizes rápidas.

Essa interacção é essencial para saúde física e mental das crianças e fundamental para uma sociedade harmoniosa.O PROJECTOO Projecto vem ligar os três princípios básicos da Sustentabilidade:Reduzir os custos, procurando soluções mais baratas (Economia), através de uso de materiais recicláveis e ecológicos, pneus e bamboo, ambos materiais de fácil obtenção na região actuando como pilares do projecto (Baixo impacto ambiental). O projecto traz uma componente crucial para os moradores da vila caracterizado pela união da população trabalhando na projecção e construção do Jardim (Social).ONDE SUA CONTRIBUIÇÃO VAI?COMO MAIS PODE AJUDAR?O Projecto da Revitalização do Jardim, por oferecer um espaço educativo, recreativo e de lazer, é aberto para todos cidadãos, as escolas, ONGSs e comunidade em geral, contribuindo com ideias e participação. Deste modo, inscreva-se a partir do nosso e-mail ou enviando mensagens com uma proposta capaz de contribuir para realização deste projecto.Email: info@arquitectovino.com       Contacto: +258 847599643Se não tiver conta online pode transferir nacionalmente através da conta destinada à Revitalização do JardimN° da conta: 404 434 517 BIM                         13456528810001 BCI                      Mpesa: +258 847599643 Por favor, ajude-nos a espalhar a palavra! Informe a sua família e amigos sobre nós e compartilhe esta campanha no Facebook e outras redes sociais.FASES DO PROJECTONa primeira fase do projecto fez-se diagnóstico da situação actual do Jardim e a envolvente. De seguida começou-se o processo do design com a comunidade. Em terceiro lugar, foram registados todos os materiais necessários para ter um orçamento total do jardim com a finalidade de arrecadar fundos através de redes sociais e eventos locais, e por fim formar uma equipe com a comunidade para reconstruir e manter o jardim que estará completo nos finais de Julho de 2018.NOSSA EQUIPEWWW.ARQUITECTOVINO.VOMArquitecto Vino é um colectivo de arquitectos, planificadores físicos, engenheiros e artistas com sede na província de Inhambane, que visa ajudar no melhoramento das comunidades locais, contribuindo para o desenvolvimento do país. Acreditamos em uma arquitectura simples e sensível abrindo portas a uma compreensão do Natural e exploração do Moderno.PODE ESTAR PERGUNTANDO-SE1-Este é o primeiro projecto?Não, mas é o primeiro projecto envolvendo a comunidade local. Depois de trabalhar no estúdio 5 arquitectos, tendo realizado 2 cinemas festivais na cidade de Maputo usando materiais recicláveis que abrangiu cerca de 500 utentes. Durante a mesma trajectória, fizemos uma experiência coleccionando garrafas PET vazia junto à crianças da rua, com objectivo de apreender e ensinar como reutilizar garrafas, ajudando a desenvolver uma mente criativa. E também, fazemos projectos habitacionais, sempre integrando os materiais ecológicos.2-O que acontecerá se a campanha não atingir o objectivo?Nos manteremos determinados a provar que vale a pena perseguir os sonhos em que acreditamos. Realizaremos o projecto do Jardim com a ajuda que conseguirmos.3-Qual é​ o motivo?O nosso foco principal é a educação e a saúde das crianças. Nós acreditamos que o desenvolvimento de um país está nas mãos da nova geração.Tem se como objectivo a aproximação das crianças à natureza para mudar a direcção do pensar das mesmas , ter a maior atenção nelas porque elas são puras e aprendizes rápidas. Ensinar, desde cedo, conceitos de sustentabilidade para a crianças é uma tarefa importante. E com exemplos simples, podemos ter efeitos que durarão por toda sua vida.REDES SOCIAIS",18.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Fraulein Dummkopf?</h3>
<p>Educated in the Louisiana school system, it's a wonder that Brittany has made it this far. While completing her doctoral studies, Brittany was asked to present some of her groundbreaking research, per Oprah, at the largest sexology conference in the world, in Munich. Excited by this opportunity, Brittany began planning all of the fun things she could do in France. She had always longed to visit the Louvre. When sadly informed that Munich was in Germany, Brittany realized that she had a lot of learning yet to do. Not dismayed by her own idiot-savantism, Brittany is determined to get to Germany, present her research, make a contribution to the sex-positive literature, eat a gluten-free Bratwurst and find out where the hell Munich is. Topography may not be her bag...but bagging' sure is!</p>

Educated in the Louisiana school system, it's a wonder that Brittany has made it this far. While completing her doctoral studies, Brittany was asked to present some of her groundbreaking research, per Oprah, at the largest sexology conference in the world, in Munich. Excited by this opportunity, Brittany began planning all of the fun things she could do in France. She had always longed to visit the Louvre. When sadly informed that Munich was in Germany, Brittany realized that she had a lot of learning yet to do. Not dismayed by her own idiot-savantism, Brittany is determined to get to Germany, present her research, make a contribution to the sex-positive literature, eat a gluten-free Bratwurst and find out where the hell Munich is. Topography may not be her bag...but bagging' sure is!

Sex sex sex...seriously.

been
living and working in Shapira, an Ethiopian-Israeli neighborhood in
Gedera, Israel. Our main volunteer work has been in collaboration with
a local community
empowerment organization called <b>Friends by Nature</b>, or <b>Haverim B’Teva</b>
in Hebrew. Most of our activities include tutoring English through the
“Homework at Home"" program, directing hiking and leadership youth
groups, and building community gardens. <br/></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><br/></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">As part of our program, we identified needs in the community and developed a couple of different projects to attend to those needs.  One of the main things we saw was that there is little programming and activities for the younger kids in the neighborhood.  Most of the kids spend all afternoon and evening outside playing in the street with little supervision.  In the past, Friends by Nature has run a summer camp for children in the Shapira neighborhood.  However, this year there was not enough of a budget or enough counselors to facilitate a camp.  We decided to take on the summer camp as our project.<br/></p>

<p><br/>One
of our goals for the camp is that the campers come out of the

we can facilitate engaging English activities.  It is very difficult for
us to ensure that the kids who come the first day will continue coming
to camp until the end and will feel that they are part of a group.  To

<p><br/>My name is Lwam Eyassu and I am a visual communications design major at Northern Kentucky University. I will be visiting the birthplace of my parents, Eritrea, Africa, in May 2013. Although I am first generation American, I am still very connected to Africa herself. Being born and raised in America, I had the opportunity to explore the arts from a young age and pursure them in college. I haven't been to Eritrean in over a decade, and am very happy about my return. Because I haven't been back since 2002, I would like to make this trip one that is filled with purpose, positivity, and oportunity. The way I imagine this being done is through what I am most passionate about: People and the arts. I am making an effort to gather art supplies, whether used or new, to give to the children of Eritrea. Supplies such as paint brushes, water colors, journals, markers, crayons and items that can be used for jewelry making. There are tons of ways to express yourself through the arts, and nothing is limiting when it comes to this.</p>
<p><br/>Photography is a strong way to capture an experience or an individual's spirit. For this trip, I will also collect 100 disposable cameras. I will hand these cameras to the local children in the city, village, and possibly the seaside. The children will have 24 hours to capture anything they wish. The cameras will then be returned, and I will develop them in the states for public viewing by the people I share this city with. The goal is to have locals capture their lives from their own perspectives. To help us understand their world, culture, and every day life and to show us that we are all essentially the same. Too often do we see photographs taken from an outside perspective. here is an opportunity to view a genuine and original point of view. Another reason why I am doing this is to show that human connections are not restricted when it comes to distance. Though the distance between these two cities is roughly 7,200 miles, a person in Cincinnati can still inspire a child in Asmara and vice versa.</p>
<p>To accomplish these goals, I am asking for donations of cameras in addition to art supplies. Disposable cameras are good for a year after the expiration date, so all donations are welcome. As for convenience, I will be more than happy to make trips for picking up supplies anywhere in the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky region. Supplies can also be mailed if you reside outside these areas. Monetary donations are also welcomed, for it will help with the costs of developing the photographs and sending photographic prints back to the children who participated in 100 Voices.</p>
<p>Anything can help. The smallest gestures can have the most impact on someone's life, and possibly inspire them to create greater and bigger things in their future. Letters of inspiration and motivation are also welcomed and enouraged. Feel free to anonymously write a child in Eritrea about what you hope for them, or even share an experience with them that they can learn from. Although the focus of this project is on uplifting African children, I believe inspiration is a two way street. To give the youth of Eritrea inspiration will inevitably give us inspiration in return. For the youth of Africa also have something to offer.</p>
<p>You who are reading this can help me make this trip filled with purpose, positivity and opportunity. Would you help me in inspiring the youth of Africa?</p>

After talking to the principal of the school in a family trip in May 2011, we found that many of these children did so barefoot or with cheap, worn flip-flop sandals. Although the students attending grades 1 through 12 of this school are passionate, intelligent, quirky and creative young people, their inability to own a sturdy pair of shoes acts as a major barrier to their school attendance, contributing to the school's high drop-out rates. <br/><br/>A good-quality pair of shoes in Sri Lanka costs only <strong>$10 CDN</strong>. When realizing that having a pair of shoes is literally the difference between receiving a basic education or not, we are committed to ensuring that this is no longer a barrier. <br/><br/><strong>Our Broader Project<br/></strong></p>
<p>We decided to base our community empowerment plan for <strong>Adampane</strong> around the village’s main school, <strong>Adampane Sudharshana Maha Vidyalaya</strong>, where close to 200 students attend classes from Grade 1 to 12 and are fortunate to have a principal &amp; staff who are devoted to attend to every need of it’s student population the best way they can. The majority of the school staff are also from the same rural area.</p>
<p>Our first visit to the school in May, 2011 helped us to understand a myriad of social &amp; economic issues faced by the students everyday as a result of the abject poverty present  in the community. Our relationship with the school was strengthened by the gifts of school supplies we offered to a select group of poor children in the school and a meal for the entire school community. We then determined that in order to change the course of the vicious cycle of poverty, we needed to pick our pilot group of participants from within the senior group of students in the school. The Grade 10 class, which was the highest grade in the school at that time, had 16 students who were preparing to sit for the GCE ordinary level examination in December, 2011. We decided that the change should begin with this group of 16 young men &amp; women, before they too step into the same cruel circumstances that their parents &amp; grandparents currently face in their lives.<strong><br/><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>How YOU can help</strong> <br/><br/>In order to meet our broader goal of combatting the cycles of poverty in Adampane, we need to ensure that these 200 students are able to receive a basic education.

Rural school children at Adampane Sudharshana Maha Vidyalaya in the village of Adampane, Sri Lanka have to travel several kilometres to get to school each day. After talking to the principal of the school in a family trip in May 2011, we found that many of these children did so barefoot or with cheap, worn flip-flop sandals. Although the students attending grades 1 through 12 of this school are passionate, intelligent, quirky and creative young people, their inability to own a sturdy pair of shoes acts as a major barrier to their school attendance, contributing to the school's high drop-out rates. A good-quality pair of shoes in Sri Lanka costs only $10 CDN. When realizing that having a pair of shoes is literally the difference between receiving a basic education or not, we are committed to ensuring that this is no longer a barrier. Our Broader Project
We decided to base our community empowerment plan for Adampane around the village’s main school, Adampane Sudharshana Maha Vidyalaya, where close to 200 students attend classes from Grade 1 to 12 and are fortunate to have a principal & staff who are devoted to attend to every need of it’s student population the best way they can. The majority of the school staff are also from the same rural area.
Our first visit to the school in May, 2011 helped us to understand a myriad of social & economic issues faced by the students everyday as a result of the abject poverty present  in the community. Our relationship with the school was strengthened by the gifts of school supplies we offered to a select group of poor children in the school and a meal for the entire school community. We then determined that in order to change the course of the vicious cycle of poverty, we needed to pick our pilot group of participants from within the senior group of students in the school. The Grade 10 class, which was the highest grade in the school at that time, had 16 students who were preparing to sit for the GCE ordinary level examination in December, 2011. We decided that the change should begin with this group of 16 young men & women, before they too step into the same cruel circumstances that their parents & grandparents currently face in their lives.
How YOU can help In order to meet our broader goal of combatting the cycles of poverty in Adampane, we need to ensure that these 200 students are able to receive a basic education. And, in order to do that, we need to do everything possible to ensure they stay in school. Our family has already invested in getting a tutor for the classes, so students have a higher chance of excelling in the national exams. However, we need your help in raising money for something so simple - shoes - to ensure that the foundations are in place for these students to be motivated to use their natural talents successfully. Whether you contribute $10 for a pair of shoes or some spare change, you will be helping keep these children in school.

<p>Hello Indiegogo friends.  My name is Angela Barbash.  I am the Founder and CEO of <strong><em>Reconsider</em></strong>, a Ypsilanti, Michigan-based financial literacy and local investing advocacy group.  Our mission is to reshape and innovate the way we work with, create, and utilize our wealth by scrutinizing the traditional aspects of investing and money management. </p>
<p>After working in the ‘traditional’ brokerage environment, I had an ‘a ha’ moment after witnessing the devastating financial-related events of 2007-2008.  I realized there had to be a better way.  I realized the financial world was turned on its head and we needed to redefine our financial literacy if, collectively, we want to prosper in the New Economy. </p>
<p>Our campaign is mission critical.  It is the crucial - and huge - first step towards making <strong><em>Reconsider’s</em></strong> larger vision a reality.  To say that I eat, sleep and breathe this initiative would be grossly understating it!</p>
<p>If you join Reconsider on this journey you will be reshaping and redefining a financial system that increasingly benefits the few at the expense of the many.  You will be creating a better financial future for yourself, your kids, grandkids and great grandkids. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>II) What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We at Reconsider are seeking $10,000.  So what will Reconsider do with this money?  Great question. </p>
<p>Essentially this money will allow us to lay the first few bricks in the foundation of our Sustainable Wealth Education Program.</p>
<p>Specifically, we will utilize the funds to pay for the IRS filing fee to become a bonafide 501c3, hire a grant writer to pursue financial literacy foundation grants and, lastly, to set aside some funds for anticipated legal fees.</p>
<p>If we do not reach our desired goal, we will proportionally distribute any funds raised towards the above-mentioned items.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>III) The Impact</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Reconsider</em></strong> has taken the unconventional step of staring down the financial status quo and boldly stating, “this ain’t working.”</p>
<p>We are the voice of the tens or even hundreds of thousands of people who to date have not had one. </p>
<p>People who have a desire to create a better tomorrow but haven’t had an identifiable start point.  Rallying around this cause will enable all of us to create and support an independent, resilient and sustainable local economy.  </p>
<p>We are guided by our core principals of purpose, innovation and value.  And, perhaps most importantly, something largely absent from the financial world - transparency. </p>
<p>We do not operate under a cloak of secrecy or in some nebulous universe where the average person can’t comprehend where their money goes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>IV) Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>We understand times are tough and people have needed to tighten their belts.  Hell, that’s primarily why we started <strong><em>Reconsider</em></strong>!</p>
<p>You can still make a difference.  Help us spread the word both about our campaign and the need for new financial literacy.</p>
<p>Tell your friends.  Tell your enemies.  Tell your co-workers.  Tell your Facebook Friends and Tweeps.  Tell your broker!  Ok, maybe he won’t rejoice in your decision to go against the grain.  Nonetheless, the more people the better.  Our mission is in its infancy but it will eventually affect just about everyone.</p>
<p>We are agents of change but we can’t do it alone.  We believe in the power of collaboration to move our vision forward.  Through education and our collaborative efforts we will transform a grassroots movement into true structural change in the financial services industry.</p>
<p>Take control of your money and your future wealth.  Join us on this journey to create widespread economic freedom in a new financial frontier that will be transparent and sustainable.</p>

<p>We are comprised of interior design students who are passionate and determined about furthering our education and learning all we can throughout school and beyond.</p>
<p>This campaign is all about just that. Last year we were able to attend the Hospitality Design Convention in Las Vegas and it proved to be an astounding opportunity for us to learn more about design and experience it first hand. This year we are planning on taking another trip to Neocon in Chicago, Illinois on June 10-13, 2013.</p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We are planning on taking 11 students on this trip. We have estimated the total cost to be approximately $9,000 for travel, hotel, and other expenses. We have been able to raise the bulk of this amount through local fundraising and donations. We still need $2,000 to help pay for:</p>

<p>With your help, we can take this trip which will greatly enhance our education and knowledge of the vast world of design.</p>

donating 20% of profits to <a href=""http://www.stairnola.org/content/home.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">STAIR</a>, a New Orleans tutoring group helping elementary school students succeed.</p>

<p>Education MATTERS: this is the launch of the second product by <a href=""http://matternola.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">MATTER L3C</a>, Design for Social Change, the initial product being BirdProject [<a href=""http://birdproject.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">www.birdproject.org</a>].
 For this new product for Social Change I am working with Cécile 
Thalmann and Adel Kassem, friends and designers based in Milano.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Recognizing
 the importance of children's education, upon seeing Cécile and Adel's 
beautiful rabbit concept, I had the idea of connecting it with the 
important need for raising the literacy rate in New Orleans, and thought
 this lovely bunny could help inspire children to read and fall in love 
with reading. We have been working together the past few weeks via skype
 and are excited to bring the Rabbkins to you!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Cécile's 
grandmother used to play with her using this napkin rabbit trick and 
Cécile has been sharing it with others ever since! It's such a 
delightful magic trick! The transformation of the napkin into the puppet
 helps spark a child's imagination and also becomes their reading buddy,
 wandering through books and lands of imagination. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Initially we will create these napkins or Rabbkins in New Orleans, 20% of the profits going to <a href=""http://www.stairnola.org/content/home.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">ST﻿AI﻿R</a>. STAIR is a New Orleans tutoring group assisting elementary school students who need extra help in learning how to read. The <a href=""http://www.stairnola.org/content/how-stair-works.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">students involved with STAIR</a>
 are in danger of academic failure and need this extra help to succeed. 
New Orleans' literacy rate is startling at a rate near 50%, with 1 out 
of 10 students graduating high school. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Heart &amp; soul is being 
put into improving the education system here in New Orleans post 
Katrina, which put a spotlight on the problems and large gaps in the 
system. Teachers here in dear NOLA are working so hard to help their 
students. Thank you teachers! Thank you tutors! Innovative programs are 
in development to re-think and build the successes of schools - 
including <a href=""http://www.4pt0.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">4.0 Schools</a> and <a href=""http://http://schoolatblairgrocery.blogspot.com/p/about-osbg.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Our School at Fair Grocery</a>.

<p><br/></p>
<p>We
 would like to help spread the joy of reading with the Rabbkin. Giving 
children extra support while in elementary school helps to give them a 
good start and opportunities for many successes ahead! STAIR is helping 
children across New Orleans learn to read and to stay in school. Their 
tutoring program is also <a href=""http://www.stairnola.org/content/stair-affiliates.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">spreading around the country</a> by people who saw its <a href=""http://www.stairnola.org/content/upstairs.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">success</a>
 and started a STAIR site in their community. Thank you to the children 
seen in our video, members of STAIR's program, who helped test out the 
prototype and made for such a great reading of the Velveteen Rabbit : )</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This round of funding is to create an initial herd of 500 Rabbkins here in New Orleans, being printed at <a href=""http://gopurplemonkey.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Purple Monkey</a>
 in the Bywater with eco-inks on fair trade cotton. If we go past our 
set goal, this funding will be used for creating the Rabbkins on Cécile 
and Adel's side of the ocean in Milano! The 20% of profit donation for 
the Milano Rabbits would also go to a correlating group in Italy. 
[European retailers please let us know if you are interested!]</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Help
 us get this herd of Rabbits into the world and hopping around on 
children's hands and rabbit's noses in books for Easter! Afterall, this 
is the year of the <a href=""http://www.aolnews.com/2011/02/01/year-of-the-rabbit-5-facts-about-the-chinese-astrological-sign/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">RABBIT</a>!</p>

Education MATTERS: this is the launch of the second product by MATTER L3C, Design for Social Change, the initial product being BirdProject [www.birdproject.org].
 For this new product for Social Change I am working with Cécile 
Thalmann and Adel Kassem, friends and designers based in Milano.

Recognizing
 the importance of children's education, upon seeing Cécile and Adel's 
beautiful rabbit concept, I had the idea of connecting it with the 
important need for raising the literacy rate in New Orleans, and thought
 this lovely bunny could help inspire children to read and fall in love 
with reading. We have been working together the past few weeks via skype
 and are excited to bring the Rabbkins to you!

Cécile's 
grandmother used to play with her using this napkin rabbit trick and 
Cécile has been sharing it with others ever since! It's such a 
delightful magic trick! The transformation of the napkin into the puppet
 helps spark a child's imagination and also becomes their reading buddy,
 wandering through books and lands of imagination. 

Initially we will create these napkins or Rabbkins in New Orleans, 20% of the profits going to ST﻿AI﻿R. STAIR is a New Orleans tutoring group assisting elementary school students who need extra help in learning how to read. The students involved with STAIR
 are in danger of academic failure and need this extra help to succeed. 
New Orleans' literacy rate is startling at a rate near 50%, with 1 out 
of 10 students graduating high school. 

Heart & soul is being 
put into improving the education system here in New Orleans post 
Katrina, which put a spotlight on the problems and large gaps in the 
system. Teachers here in dear NOLA are working so hard to help their 
students. Thank you teachers! Thank you tutors! Innovative programs are 
in development to re-think and build the successes of schools - 
including 4.0 Schools and Our School at Fair Grocery. [Please read founder Nat Turner's inspiring story here.] 

We
 would like to help spread the joy of reading with the Rabbkin. Giving 
children extra support while in elementary school helps to give them a 
good start and opportunities for many successes ahead! STAIR is helping 
children across New Orleans learn to read and to stay in school. Their 
tutoring program is also spreading around the country by people who saw its success
 and started a STAIR site in their community. Thank you to the children 
seen in our video, members of STAIR's program, who helped test out the 
prototype and made for such a great reading of the Velveteen Rabbit : )

This round of funding is to create an initial herd of 500 Rabbkins here in New Orleans, being printed at Purple Monkey
 in the Bywater with eco-inks on fair trade cotton. If we go past our 
set goal, this funding will be used for creating the Rabbkins on Cécile 
and Adel's side of the ocean in Milano! The 20% of profit donation for 
the Milano Rabbits would also go to a correlating group in Italy. 
[European retailers please let us know if you are interested!]

Help
 us get this herd of Rabbits into the world and hopping around on 
children's hands and rabbit's noses in books for Easter! Afterall, this 
is the year of the RABBIT!

Thank you for your support and please enjoy your Rabbkin!!

<h3 style="""">The Nitty-Gritty</h3>
<div>Travel Dates: September 1st, 2011 to May 25th, 2012</div>
<div>Reason for travel: Studying in Spain and Certifying to teach in Spain!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Ever since I was a child I have been interested in theatre, language, and people, particularly youth. (For example, as a child I quickly took to the stage, probed anyone Spanish-speaking to teach me words, and was ever-fascinated with any and all smaller beings.) In college these interests crystallized into a Sociology and Spanish double major with additional courses in Theatre. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>In my teenage years I would provide complimentary childcare for family members and friends (why would I want to be paid to play with children- aka to do something I loved?); in college I provided even more, now paid, childcare in addition to participating in teaching internships and summer programs (Urban Education Fellowship, placement in New York City; Exploration Summer Programs, through St. Mark's). My fascination is Theatre through Education, and Education through Theatre. That means that yes, I am loud and bubbly, while also focused, driven, and I believe that children wield an amazing power and sense of creativity that should be strengthened and focused into each and every one of their individual interests. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I am, additionally, fascinated by how language shapes worlds. What is it like to live in a different language? <i>Immensely </i>different. In Spain I intend to become more fluent in Spanish, study, and collect research for a senior thesis and/or Fulbright attempt to compare and contrast communication through the Spanish and English languages (as it concerns western Spain and the United States). I will also become certified to teach in Spain through the TEFL program in Madrid, which is my primary interest for a future career post-grad. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I have all of the ambition, motivation, and drive, with almost none of the funding necessary to support the three. Being my own, sole financier comes of great pride to me; however, the truth is that I am a 20-year old college student who has never had grave funds to finance. Any and all help will be, truly, a blessing. </div>
<p style=""""><br/></p>
</div>
<h3>For You, A Thousand Times</h3>
<p>The Spanish consulate states that students should have about $1,000 per month of study in Spain. Breaking down my September-May stay, that would amount to $8,000. A good amount, yes; feasible, no. I would love to raise, feasibly, $5,000- or $2,500 per semester. My goal is to raise half, or $2,500, on my own, and to depend on your grace for the rest (or more!). <b>My listed goal states $2,750 to offset the percentage that Indiegogo collects from campaigns; I am excited and hopeful to achieve much higher than that though!</b></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>All contributions will be put towards financing my junior year of study abroad, which includes travel, survival (housing and food), courses, researching for a senior thesis/Fulbright application and finally a month-long TEFL certification course in Madrid to teach English as a Foreign Language once I graduate. With the US to Euro exchange rate of $1.40 USD to 1 Euro, more funds means less of an impact from the change in currency. I appreciate anything that you can contribute, with the hopes that you know I would do the same for you.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>My name is Ashleigh Murray, I'm 25 years old and the second oldest of three children, but this campaign isn't about me; it’s about my remarkable little brother, Navar Clark. He’s 19 years old, a high school graduate, trilingual, and has Asperger’s Syndrome. He's the brightest, kindest, most eccentric person I've ever known. His biggest aspiration is to study in Japan and the best way for him to do that is by attending a college with a fierce study abroad program!</p>
<p>This past fall my mother and brother visited the campus of William Jewell College in Liberty, Missouri where they both fell in love with the institution.

They were all equally impressed Navar's knowledge of Japanese culture as well as the language, especially since he taught himself how to read, write, and speak it in less than a year.</p>
<p>They finished up their tour of the campus in the financial aid office and that's where everything came to a screeching halt. The cost for the year was quoted at $42,790. That included tuition and room &amp; board. Even with the grants, scholarships, and awards given him, there was a balance left of $4000. Sadly to say, my family couldn't afford to send him right away. My mother, doing her best to comfort Navar, assured him not to worry. We would try again to enroll him for the spring semester.

<p>In November of 2012, my mother called me at work to say that she had spoken with the financial aid department at Jewell, and the balance due for Navar to attend college this January was about $800! You can imagine how ecstatic we were. I come from a lower-middle class family and just getting me through college was stressful enough.</p>
<p>Now, I am employed at a law firm here in New York City. While I don’t make loads of money, I get by. This year, we received Christmas bonuses, and so I decided that my gift to the family would be to give $500 to help make up most of the balance due. Sharing this news made for a joyous Christmas. My mother said she would try to find a way to make up the remainder. Navar was going to college!!</p>
<p>Last week, Mom called with will some unsettling news. She told me that the break down for the spring semester would be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>$15,100 for tuition</li>
<li>$2,165 for housing</li>
<li>$1,715 for his meals</li>
<li>Total for the semester $18,980</li>

</tbody></table><p>Now, if you add the totals, the balance comes to $1780, not $800! So, where did the $800 figure come from? Well, the financial aid representative accidentally counted the work study amount twice when he quoted my mother the final balance. Once again, we found ourselves at an unreachable deficit. With my $500 gift, we are still $1280 short for his tuition, not including the $300 non-refundable deposit needed for housing. How could this be? It’s disheartening to think that such a small amount (in comparison to the total cost) is standing between my brother and a promising future. </p>
<p>Navar is a very special young man who has overcome many obstacles in his young life. During the first 18 months of his life, he suffered from a total of 13 inner ear infections, which led to him getting tubes put in his ears at age 2. Because of these infections, he didn’t start talking until he was about 2 ½ years old. The doctors said this was because, during the first 18months, his hearing was muffled due to the fluid that was constantly in his ears. Once that issue was resolved, however, he began talking up a storm! His first clear word was “coffee.”  The day he first said it, we were all so happy and excited, praising him all day. Because of this praise, he ran around the house all day yelling, “Coffee! Coffee!”  Also, Navar’s favorite move at the time was The Lion King. He would watch it over and over for hours. The running joke in our house was that the Lion King taught him how to talk, because when he spoke, his tone and inflection mimicked that of Simba.</p>
<p>Navar faced many challenges throughout his school years, however he overcame each one. Although he had difficulty socializing and making friends, his level of intelligence and pragmatic, “little professor-type” speech endeared him to many. He began to develop a love for Japanese anime, which eventually led him to his passion for Japanese culture. He became so proficient in the language that, for his community service requirement for graduation, Navar taught a Japanese class after school once a week. His class consisted of fellow students and teachers. One of his students commented that Navar was one of the best teachers he’d ever had. </p>
<p>Japan, however, is not his only passion. He loves learning all languages, as well as the arts. Not only did he teach himself Japanese, he also speaks French, having taken to the language so well that his instructor skipped him from French I to French III in his sophomore year in high school. By the time he graduated, he was in a class equivalent to first-year College French. Navar is an exceptional cartoonist, becoming quite proficient in anime, even to the point in creating his on characters. He loves music, and plays the trumpet, as well as teaching himself to play the piano. We were told by a music professor that he has perfect pitch. Due to his accomplishments in academics, he was nominated to serve as a National Scholar representing the state of Missouri at the National Young Leaders Conference (NYLC), which was held in Washington, D.C. during the summer 2011. He was personally selected by his physics teacher at Southwest Early College Campus, Mr. Grigori Saiyan, as an outstanding individual who has achieved academic excellence and possesses leadership potential.</p>
<p>Attending college is a huge step in his development, not just academically, but socially, as well. Because of the issues he has faced throughout his young life due to Asperger Syndrome, Navar struggled with his social development. He was constantly bullied in school by other students who didn't understand why or how he was different from them. However, Navar was steadfast in his efforts to fit in with his peers. He developed close friendships with certain students and teachers.  After a while, Navarre soon became a much loved person in the student populous.</p>
<p>Although technically, he is in the autism spectrum, Navar is what is considered extremely high-functioning. I feel comfortable in saying that Navar could be considered a genius. He is much like other famous geniuses who were/are thought to have Asperger's syndrome such as Bill Gates, Mozart, and Albert Einstein. I believe that, if given the chance, he could be one of the great contributors to human history.</p>
<p>The lengths of his talents reach farther than any website summary can muster, but allow me to leave you with some of his own words. One of Navar's favorite quotes about himself is, ""There's no 'asp' in my burgers!""</p>
<p>I believe that says it all.</p></div>","Note: to jump to video of Navar in action, click these links.

Hello,
My name is Ashleigh Murray, I'm 25 years old and the second oldest of three children, but this campaign isn't about me; it’s about my remarkable little brother, Navar Clark. He’s 19 years old, a high school graduate, trilingual, and has Asperger’s Syndrome. He's the brightest, kindest, most eccentric person I've ever known. His biggest aspiration is to study in Japan and the best way for him to do that is by attending a college with a fierce study abroad program!
This past fall my mother and brother visited the campus of William Jewell College in Liberty, Missouri where they both fell in love with the institution. It wasn't the stunning grounds or high-end facilities that won them over, but the exceptionally stellar Japanese Studies department. Navar met with many of the faculty as well as the department's head. They were all equally impressed Navar's knowledge of Japanese culture as well as the language, especially since he taught himself how to read, write, and speak it in less than a year.
They finished up their tour of the campus in the financial aid office and that's where everything came to a screeching halt. The cost for the year was quoted at $42,790. That included tuition and room & board. Even with the grants, scholarships, and awards given him, there was a balance left of $4000. Sadly to say, my family couldn't afford to send him right away. My mother, doing her best to comfort Navar, assured him not to worry. We would try again to enroll him for the spring semester. Perhaps with the continuation of applying for scholarships and her attempting to find part-time employment, the monies would be available for him to attend in January. Even though this would be a daunting task, as my mother is disabled with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and on a fixed income, she was determined to help her youngest child realize his dream.
In November of 2012, my mother called me at work to say that she had spoken with the financial aid department at Jewell, and the balance due for Navar to attend college this January was about $800! You can imagine how ecstatic we were. I come from a lower-middle class family and just getting me through college was stressful enough.
Now, I am employed at a law firm here in New York City. While I don’t make loads of money, I get by. This year, we received Christmas bonuses, and so I decided that my gift to the family would be to give $500 to help make up most of the balance due. Sharing this news made for a joyous Christmas. My mother said she would try to find a way to make up the remainder. Navar was going to college!!
Last week, Mom called with will some unsettling news. She told me that the break down for the spring semester would be as follows:

$15,100 for tuition
$2,165 for housing
$1,715 for his meals
Total for the semester $18,980

<h3>I AM a Dream Doula, an Energy Shifter and a Lightworker and a Connector of Connectors. I am currently following my Divine Plan, my True Life Purpose, by studying to be an Angel Minister through Gateway University's Angel MInistry.  I have already graduated as an Angel Reader Certified (ARC) as part one of the three part Ordination Program which culminates, as SYNCHRONICITY would have it, on my birthday, or should I say my Rebirthday on April 11, 2013. </h3>
<h3>My son and I have recently found ourselves homeless after my fiance who is suffering from alcoholism, broke off our engagment and asked me and my son to move out with no vehicle, no home or biological family to turn to and with only twenty cents in our pockets. I have been thinking a lot about how despite my fiances actions, I can continue to provide him with Uconditional Love and Support. He has never received this from anyone but me, and he is closing his Heart off to it. I know this is what is happening. Instead of Opening and Accepting my Light into his life, I AM Illuminating his dark places and he is terrified and closing the door.  I AM being a Conscious Observer of my life and my experiences and I AM opening my door and walking through this Gateway into a brand New World!</h3>
<h3>I AM Asking You, my Soul Brothers and Sisters and fellow Earth Angels, to shower me with your Unconditional Love and Support in allowing me the honor and the priviledge of continuing my Ministerial Studies.  </h3>
<h3>I consider myself a catalyst for transformation and a Rainbow Bridge to Spirit, helping others to create positive shifts and transformations in their lives. I AM both a student and a teacher. But, most importantly, I AM a Divine Human who is the perfect vessel to house my amazing Spirit.</h3>
<h3>It is part of my Life Purpose to Help people to become Aware of the blocks that are preventing them from Manifesting their Hearts' Desires by Shifting their Energy and raising their Vibration to Resonate with MORE, so that they can Create the life of their Dreams.</h3>
<h3>A Doula is a facilitator of the birthing process. As a Dream Doula, I accompany those who Connect with me on their Journey of Renewal and Rebirth, Shifting and Transforming negative Energy into Positive Channels of Peace, Love and Harmony.</h3>
<h3>As we Ride the Waves of Infinite Possibilities, we are Energizing and Enlivened. This process is never overwhelming. We learn that we have an Abundance of Unconditional Love and Support at any given moment, as we Discover that anyone can Open their Hearts and tap into the World of Spirit.</h3>
<h3>As a Dream Doula, think of me as an Earth Angel, a Beacon of Light, a Magical Sherpa, Guiding you to be your own Rainbow Bridge to Spirit. You will learn how to Recognize, tap into and make Strong, Intimate Connections with your Spirit Guides, Ascended and Cosmic Masters, Totem Animal Spirits and your own Team of Angels.

</div></span></div>","I AM a Dream Doula, an Energy Shifter and a Lightworker and a Connector of Connectors. I am currently following my Divine Plan, my True Life Purpose, by studying to be an Angel Minister through Gateway University's Angel MInistry.  I have already graduated as an Angel Reader Certified (ARC) as part one of the three part Ordination Program which culminates, as SYNCHRONICITY would have it, on my birthday, or should I say my Rebirthday on April 11, 2013. 
My son and I have recently found ourselves homeless after my fiance who is suffering from alcoholism, broke off our engagment and asked me and my son to move out with no vehicle, no home or biological family to turn to and with only twenty cents in our pockets. I have been thinking a lot about how despite my fiances actions, I can continue to provide him with Uconditional Love and Support. He has never received this from anyone but me, and he is closing his Heart off to it. I know this is what is happening. Instead of Opening and Accepting my Light into his life, I AM Illuminating his dark places and he is terrified and closing the door.  I AM being a Conscious Observer of my life and my experiences and I AM opening my door and walking through this Gateway into a brand New World!
I AM Asking You, my Soul Brothers and Sisters and fellow Earth Angels, to shower me with your Unconditional Love and Support in allowing me the honor and the priviledge of continuing my Ministerial Studies.  
I consider myself a catalyst for transformation and a Rainbow Bridge to Spirit, helping others to create positive shifts and transformations in their lives. I AM both a student and a teacher. But, most importantly, I AM a Divine Human who is the perfect vessel to house my amazing Spirit.
It is part of my Life Purpose to Help people to become Aware of the blocks that are preventing them from Manifesting their Hearts' Desires by Shifting their Energy and raising their Vibration to Resonate with MORE, so that they can Create the life of their Dreams.
A Doula is a facilitator of the birthing process. As a Dream Doula, I accompany those who Connect with me on their Journey of Renewal and Rebirth, Shifting and Transforming negative Energy into Positive Channels of Peace, Love and Harmony.
As we Ride the Waves of Infinite Possibilities, we are Energizing and Enlivened. This process is never overwhelming. We learn that we have an Abundance of Unconditional Love and Support at any given moment, as we Discover that anyone can Open their Hearts and tap into the World of Spirit.
As a Dream Doula, think of me as an Earth Angel, a Beacon of Light, a Magical Sherpa, Guiding you to be your own Rainbow Bridge to Spirit. You will learn how to Recognize, tap into and make Strong, Intimate Connections with your Spirit Guides, Ascended and Cosmic Masters, Totem Animal Spirits and your own Team of Angels. These Incredible Beings of Light from the Celestial Realms are Delighted when you Connect with them and when you call to them and Ask for their Help. It is their job to respond to us with their Loving Assistance.
Together, with the Guidance of your Celestial Support Team, we will Help you to Clear the Clutter from your mind and your life so that you can have experiences of Healing, Release, Abundnace and Prosperity, Creativity, Joy, Love, Peace and Harmony, or whatever it is that your Heart and Soul Desires.
We will Transcend our life experiences by Being Conscious Observer of our own reality. From this perspective, we Recognize when we are blocking our own Receiving. Our challenges become our Strengths and we begin to value ALL of our life experiences. Obstacles become Opportunities leading us to the next step on the Divine Path to Discovering our True Life Purpose.

<h2 class=""header Heading3"">Emergency Preparedness</h2>

<div class=""stepMeat"">
<div>
<p>According to the American Heart Association, people trained in CPR can save the lives of people who have sudden cardiac arrest outside of hospitals. The American Heart Association reports that each year 294,851 sudden cardiac arrests occur outside of hospitals in the United States and that about 80 percent of all sudden cardiac arrests occur in the victim's home. People may suffer sudden cardiac arrest at work or in public places. The American Heart Association reports that few people who have sudden cardiac arrest outside of the hospital receive CPR -- about 27.4 percent -- and nearly 94 percent of all cardiac arrest victims die before they reach a hospital.</p>

<h2 class=""header Heading3"">The Importance of Time for Survival</h2>
<ul>
<li class=""step"">
<div class=""stepMeat"">
<div>
<p>According to the American Heart Association, CPR provided immediately after cardiac arrest can double or triple the chance that a person will survive. For each minute following cardiac arrest that a victim does not receive CPR, the chance of survival is reduced by 7 to 10 percent. Resuscitation efforts are more likely to fail if the victim does not receive CPR and defibrillation in the first few minutes after sudden cardiac arrest. The American Heart Association encourages people to learn CPR because performing CPR adds minutes to the window of time during which a defibrillator is likely to restart the victim's heart.</p>

<p>The American Heart Association stresses the importance of immediate CPR to prevent brain death. CPR can prevent brain death by maintaining the flow of blood to the victim's heart and brain, but only if it begins within four to six minutes following cardiac arrest. The time it takes for medical personnel to arrive may be too long to prevent brain death or permanent organ damage. Performing CPR until emergency help arrives may determine whether a victim survives or how well a victim recovers.</p>

The Impact
Community Service




CPR-trained citizens contribute to their communities by being able to help out in emergencies. Sudden cardiac arrest does not have to result in death. If more people are trained in CPR, more cardiac arrest victims will survive. Emergency medical personnel have a better chance of saving lives if someone is able to keep the cardiac arrest victim alive until they arrive on the scene.

While millions of people have been trained to perform CPR, most Americans do not know how to perform the technique. The American Heart Association works to increase the number of people trained in the use of CPR in order to increase the number of sudden cardiac arrest survivors.




Emergency Preparedness




According to the American Heart Association, people trained in CPR can save the lives of people who have sudden cardiac arrest outside of hospitals. The American Heart Association reports that each year 294,851 sudden cardiac arrests occur outside of hospitals in the United States and that about 80 percent of all sudden cardiac arrests occur in the victim's home.

<p></p></div>","Our Story: In 2010 a group of parents founded Padres Organizados por la Educacion en Sunset Park (POESP), in order to build relationships with local public schools and educate other parents regarding their rights in a new school system. Over the last 3 years, POESP has organized with and supported over 30 immigrant parents to become leaders and advocates for better educational opportunities in public schools. With a new administration in New York City, now is the time for previously marginalized parents and students to organize and bring their concerns to the table. 

This project will allow La Unión to: 

-Expand capacity to reach out to new parents to bring their concerns to the new administration
-Provide leadership trainings for new members 
-Develop policy recommendations and community communications to create equitable educational opportunities for all students
-Work through existing coalitions and meetings between immigrant parents and education officials to have recommendations adopted 

Our Goal: $5,000
 Help us start strong in 2014
1. Community Outreach Meetings: space, refreshments, materials, childcare, staff time to develop outreach materials 
2. Parent Trainings through Parent Meetings, Juega y Aprende: support materials, art and educational supplies, staff time 
3. Research or Consulting cost for developing policy recommendations with parents' concerns at the center
4. Media and Communication Cost to gain exposure and support for policy recommendation


**If we don’t reach our goal of $5,000 we will continue to move forward with our policy recommendations, but  we won't be able to develop as strong of a force to bring our concerns to the table. We will also be limited in our ability to reach out and engage new parents.  



 Current Work Around Education:
-Padres Organizados por al Educación en Sunset Park (POESP): A weekly parent organizing meeting centered around discussions and trainings to facilitate parent involvement in their children's education. Parents develop the meeting agendas, conduct outreach, do presentations about the group and its objectives, and develop campaigns to improve schools in Sunset Park.  
-Juega y Aprenda: A bi-weekly educational play group formed by 25 parents and their 2-4 year olds in partnership with PS 24 and Morningside Center to address the lack of educational programs for young children in Sunset Park. 
-ESL Classes: Bi-weekly adult English classes  grounded in notions of liberating pedagogoy and social justice values.  ESL students are also engaging as La Unión members. 
-ESOL Program: In addition to offering ESL classes to the community, we are currently training a group of 6 members of La Unión as ESOL teachers.
-Summer Camp: A program where intergenerational dialogue and learning takes place to advance the goals of transnational families. 

Recent Highlights:
*June 2013- A group of mothers prepared and presented an exhibit and panel on the role of immigrant mothers in their children's' education at the CUNY Institute of Mexican Studies Annual Conference. (photos by David Bacon)
*July 2013- We held our 5th summer camp with 15 participants giving disadvantaged youth and their parents the opportunity to learn about college options and the college process along with learning about other community issues.
* '12-'13 School Year-POESP developed strong relationships with Dual School PS 24.  We now have the full support of the principal and a group of 10 teachers.
*This Year- We held or participated in over 12 outreach sessions educating and empowering over 450 immigrant parents regarding their rights in schools.

La Unión also does a lot of great work around immigrant rights and food justice.   Check out our website to learn more www.la-union.org

This will ensure that the books content will be free and available for everyone once the book is completed. </p><h3>Language</h3><p>The book will be available in two languages. Because the course itself is held in Norway the book will initially be written in Norwegian because I think it is important for the students to have material available to them in their native language. Each chapter will then be translated into English. </p><p></p><h1>Course and Book Content</h1><p>The content of the course, and this also the book, is divided up into 7 lessons.

Por ello, debemos construir una, el presupuesto asciende cerca de los 11.000 €. Estamos esforzándonos en llegar a dicha suma, aún así necesitamos vuestra colaboración para hacer perdurable este sueño.Muchas gracias!!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

In the craziness that was my house growing up books were my escape. I started reading at a young age and never stopped. Anytime I wanted to escape my brothers or avoid doing something I didn't want to do or I was going through a tough time I would read a book. So that's what I want to do with my life, books. I want to be involved in bringing a story to life, a story that will help others the way books have always helped me and I'm so close to making that dream come true. I've been accepted into City University London for their Masters degree in Creative Writing and Publishing. This is my dream come true and I'm so close to it happening that I'm practically bouncing off the walls.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Nitty Gritty</h3><p> The money I'm asking for is going towards tuition and housing. Combined and converted into american dollars it's going to be about $50,000, the extra $4,000 is for the fees involved in making the campaign. £13,005 for the apartment and £15,000 for the course. The conversion rate at the moment is $1.68 to £1. Those two things are the main costs I have and the main hurdles I have to overcome. Should I get anything over the goal that money will be put towards my visa, my books for the course, and food. </p><p>Currently I'm working two jobs in order to save as much as I can while still making my student loan payments and my family is offering all the support they can. The goal is to get as much of it paid for without loans as possible so I can avoid going further into debt. Every little thing helps. Any money raised, whether I reach my goal or not, is going to go to my education and fulfilling my dream.</p><p>I spent time in  London last summer for school and since the moment I got on the plane to come home I've been dying to go back. To be able to do so in order to do what I've wanted to do for years is just mind boggling. Learning about publishing and bettering my writing skills in England is indescribable and I'm so thrilled I get the chance. </p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>I know not everyone can make a contribution and that's ok. You can still help me by spreading the news. Let other people know, use the indiegogo share tools. Follow my example and just spam the heck out of your social media pages. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. :)</p></div>","Me in A Nut ShellMy name's Maggie, I'm 23 and I'm the second youngest of six. In the craziness that was my house growing up books were my escape.

Should I get anything over the goal that money will be put towards my visa, my books for the course, and food. Currently I'm working two jobs in order to save as much as I can while still making my student loan payments and my family is offering all the support they can. The goal is to get as much of it paid for without loans as possible so I can avoid going further into debt. Every little thing helps. Any money raised, whether I reach my goal or not, is going to go to my education and fulfilling my dream.I spent time in  London last summer for school and since the moment I got on the plane to come home I've been dying to go back. To be able to do so in order to do what I've wanted to do for years is just mind boggling. Learning about publishing and bettering my writing skills in England is indescribable and I'm so thrilled I get the chance. Other Ways You Can HelpI know not everyone can make a contribution and that's ok. You can still help me by spreading the news. Let other people know, use the indiegogo share tools. Follow my example and just spam the heck out of your social media pages. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. :)",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<li>I will break the trip up into smaller sections, creating a route for each section and making my arrangements for transportation in advance.  </li> <li>I am also breaking the trip up in a way that allows for recovery days in between routes so that I can catch up on my writing and update the blog.  </li>
<li>Also, there are obvious risks of traveling to new and exotic places, but I have safety smarts that I hope will carry me well.  </li> </ul><p></p> <p> </p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Some people just can't contribute dollars, but that doesn't mean you can't help:</p> <ul>

Every dollar you give helps me reach one more community, one more state, and helps to provide a more accurate understanding of the National Intentional Community culture of law.    The Impact If you support this project you'll be encouraging myself and other law students that there really is a way to succeed outside of Big Law.   
You and everyone else who hears about this can discover a new way of living and we take what we can learn together from Intentional Communities to better shape our own culture.  You'll be helping me to connect lawyers, organizations, and communities who are all aiming for similar goals but often have not heard of each other. Already people are sending me questions and concerns they have about their legal set-ups and already lawyers are following my project, some even wanting to join the travels! 
Risks & Challenges Although I took the train from Nebraska to New York when I first moved to law school, I have otherwise not travelled using bus and train as my main mode of transportation.  There is the chance that I may get delayed or miss connections from place to place.  Additionally, there is the chance that I get so much information that I can't keep up with putting it all together according to timeline.  Therefore: 
I will break the trip up into smaller sections, creating a route for each section and making my arrangements for transportation in advance.   I am also breaking the trip up in a way that allows for recovery days in between routes so that I can catch up on my writing and update the blog.  
Also, there are obvious risks of traveling to new and exotic places, but I have safety smarts that I hope will carry me well.     Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute dollars, but that doesn't mean you can't help: 
Please check out my blog and read up on the adventure!
Follow us on Facebook and join the conversation on community.
Get live feed updates of community visits on Twitter. Share this campaign! If you know of someone who might be interested please email them a link! Or share it with all of your friends, flyer your neighborhood, post it in your local courthouse, etc.  (I may have to come up with a special reward for advocacy creativity…)
And if you're not into the social media craze, please just support your loved ones, your children, your peers to pursue what really makes them happy rather than the status quo.    One of the most important things is to never lose your passion, so thank you for supporting mine.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

This campaign is Phase 1 of 5.  We are currently raising funds so that therapeutic art facilitator, Kat Thorsen, can spend two months writing and illustrating a life skills and entrepreneurship handbook in partnership with Operation Sock Monkey (OSM). 



WHAT IS OSM?
OSM (founded by Lindsey Hodgson) is a volunteer-run initiative in support of humanitarian organizations that provide laughter, hope and healing to communities around the world affected by disease, disaster and social/political turmoil.  


WHY A HANDBOOK?
The OSM handbook will allow us to leave a lasting and empowering legacy of art-, life- and business-skills when we complete our field work.  
The target consumer of the handbook includes:
• Youth programs (youth-at-risk, inner city, rural, secondary schools, alternative schools)
• Global community groups 
• Therapeutic and Special Needs support programming
• Micro-industry development
• Intergenerational programs

WHAT ARE THE PHASES OF THE OSM HANDBOOK PROJECT?
This campaign covers Phase 1.

What We Need & What You Get


The money raised will be Kat's income for two months.  We need to have a prototype ready for when school gets back in session in the Fall.  
The pilot projects will allow Kat to refine the handbook and incorporate photography and to develop a website. If we do not reach our goal, we will have to fundraise through alternative means so that we can complete this most important and urgent work.
If we exceed our goal, the funds will allow us to pay honorariums to a core group of local youth who will help implement the pilot project and to continue refining the handbook.  We will also be able to offer the pilot projects to more schools and special needs groups, and to focus on website development and printing costs.  
A Spring 2015 Indiegogo campaign will fundraise for the September 2015 OSM South Africa trip.
In the perks section, you will see some amazing rewards depending on the level of contribution!  Of course the theme is all about the sock monkey!
 




  The Impact
Your contribution will allow OSM to provide sustainable programming.  OSM is already in the field around the world.  Now it's time to create a lasting and empowering educational component!

<div><br/></div>
<div>The first two days are spent travelling to the airport where we will then head on a 10 hour flight and spend the day in Livingstone, Zambia where we will have a chance to relax and buy supplies before we head out on our 4 day trek!</div>
<div><br/></div>

<div>-Working in a School to improve the facilities and meet some of the young students</div>
<div>-Visiting an Old People's home to spend time with some of the residents</div>
<div>-Help improve the healthcare and water resources</div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>We then return to Zambia where we will be spending the day visiting Victoria Falls which is one of Africa's most famous and beautiful waterfalls.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The next day we will be exploring the local area in Livingstone which will give us a chance to visit some of the local businesses and celebrate what we have achieved on this trip.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The next two days will then be spent going to the airport and taking a 10 hour flight back to the UK!</div>
<h3>What The Funds Go Towards</h3> <p>My School and Schools Worldwide have set us two fund raising deadlines. The first deadline is a £1096 instalment by the 21st of November and the second is a £1353 meaning the total amount I have to fund raise is £2449. </p>
<p>I have decided to focus on each instalment's at a time rather than to try and raise the total amount at one time which is why I will be creating two campaigns. The first one is this one and the second one will be up around February. </p>
<p>The funds goes towards many things such as Travel, Accommodation, Vaccinations, Equipment and resources to give towards the community in Livingstone, </p>
<p>If I am able to raise more than £1096 in this campaign, I will be contributing the rest of the money towards my second deposit which deadlines in April. If I am able to raise over £2449 (which I would be eternally grateful for!) the money left over will go towards other students instalment's so they are able to have the chance to embark on this journey with me!</p>
<p>If however, I fail to reach these targets, I will give all funds that have been raised to other students embarking on the trip to Zambia and Botswana.</p>
<p> I wish to mention as well that fund raising efforts will not be totally reliant on this campaign as I will be fundraising through various other ways such as setting up school disco's for the year 7's in my School, Cake sales, car boot sales and various other ways. This campaign will just be a huge help towards fundraising efforts as it will allow me more time to study for my A-levels and for that, I will be grateful if you wish to donate or simply spread the word of this campaign. </p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>I have never been a part of a project nearly similar to this and me going on this trip will not only have a massive impact on my life but you will be glad to know that you contributing for this trip will also affect the lives of the residents of Livingstone in Zambia.</p>

We then return to Zambia where we will be spending the day visiting Victoria Falls which is one of Africa's most famous and beautiful waterfalls.

The next day we will be exploring the local area in Livingstone which will give us a chance to visit some of the local businesses and celebrate what we have achieved on this trip.

The next two days will then be spent going to the airport and taking a 10 hour flight back to the UK!
What The Funds Go Towards My School and Schools Worldwide have set us two fund raising deadlines. The first deadline is a £1096 instalment by the 21st of November and the second is a £1353 meaning the total amount I have to fund raise is £2449. 
I have decided to focus on each instalment's at a time rather than to try and raise the total amount at one time which is why I will be creating two campaigns. The first one is this one and the second one will be up around February. 
The funds goes towards many things such as Travel, Accommodation, Vaccinations, Equipment and resources to give towards the community in Livingstone, 
If I am able to raise more than £1096 in this campaign, I will be contributing the rest of the money towards my second deposit which deadlines in April. If I am able to raise over £2449 (which I would be eternally grateful for!) the money left over will go towards other students instalment's so they are able to have the chance to embark on this journey with me!
If however, I fail to reach these targets, I will give all funds that have been raised to other students embarking on the trip to Zambia and Botswana.
 I wish to mention as well that fund raising efforts will not be totally reliant on this campaign as I will be fundraising through various other ways such as setting up school disco's for the year 7's in my School, Cake sales, car boot sales and various other ways. This campaign will just be a huge help towards fundraising efforts as it will allow me more time to study for my A-levels and for that, I will be grateful if you wish to donate or simply spread the word of this campaign. 

  The Impact I have never been a part of a project nearly similar to this and me going on this trip will not only have a massive impact on my life but you will be glad to know that you contributing for this trip will also affect the lives of the residents of Livingstone in Zambia.

  
New Perks Available!!!


Other Ways You Can Help

 I understand not everyone can afford to donate which is 100% understandable but I will be very grateful even if you are just spreading the word and making some noise about my campaign.

Ludiwine moved to Canada from France in 2010, with a passion for water and a love for children. She had just earned her PhD in Water Engineering and was already thinking of her next step: “How can I use my skills to make sure that everyone, and especially children, have access to clean water?”.   </span></p>

<span>Ecoloodi has achieved some pretty awesome things over the past year! We have worked with great organizations including Ecologos (Water Docs film festival), Engineers Without Borders, the Royal Ontario Museum, the Toronto Public Library, and the French Consulate in Toronto. We have been featured by media outlets, both in print (Le Métropolitain and the Express) and on television and radio (CBC). We developed many educational games and, last but certainly not least, we have been building a community of passionate individuals working towards a common goal.</span>
</div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span><h3>What are the next steps?</h3>
<p>We are convinced that play is the key to learning, since it helps us be receptive to new ideas. Ecoloodi’s approach is to create tangible education experiences in Canada and in France, while developing hands-on water solutions where they  needed. As a starting point, we have 3 simple memory games that are teaching children (and playful adults) some water issues using pictures from Canada, France and South Africa. We have tested the games many times during various events and have received great feedback. It’s time to get them into people’s hands!</p>

My goal is to attend a local music collage to increase my skill and proficiency and to also learn modern production technique to become a professional musician and teacher.What I Need What I need is simple, money! I will spend 100% of all funds on Tuition, Books, and required equipment for me to succeed the program. The cost for the program is $22,000 and that will get me a degree in music and the required equipment.The ImpactI understand that what I am asking for is a lot of money, but every little bit that I can raise will be much appreciated. Due to the injury and the subsequent financial strain that put on my family I will not be able to qualify for the loans that I need. I work full time and do everything that I can to feed my family. If I can reach my goal and become what I have always wanted to do, I will fill the life of everyone around me with music. I will also teach future generations to do the same! Other Ways You Can HelpIf you can not contribute money please help me out by using the share tools and spreading the word. This means a lot to me and you will help me with my dream! Thank you!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

learn more.By mid-Autumn of 2014, Light House will be a site for Earth-based Building Intensives and a venue through which Workshops in Permaculture are offered.Sustainability and LeadershipSustainabilityFor us, sustainability means feeling satisfied about how we spend our time, money and creativity. It means sharing our individual gifts as a way of life, and as a means of sustenance, in service to causing a sustainable future for everyone.Sustainability means wellbeing is an integral part of the experience of success. Causing that in the lives of others is our way of furthering the movement toward sustainability, on a global scale.We've located Light House 42, outside El Bolsón, Argentina, in a region where sustainability is a way of life for the people who live there, thus giving us continuous access to resources and experience that is unparalleled.Here is how Wikipedia defines Sustainability: For humans, sustainability is the potential for long-term maintenance of well being, which has ecological, economic, political and cultural dimensions. 
Sustainability requires the reconciliation of social equity with environmental    and economic demands - also referred to as the ""three pillars"" of sustainability or the 3 Es. 

Sustainability interfaces with economics through the social and environmental  consequences of economic activity. Sustainability economics involves ecological economics where social aspects including cultural, health-related and monetary/financial aspects are integrated. 
Light House aims to be a living, comprehensive model of Sustainability in action.Here's an
example: Our model requires building the Retreat and Learning Center through
hosting Bio-Building and Permaculture Workshops. Literally speaking,
our Retreat and Learning Center will build itself through the building
workshops we host--thus keeping overhead down, providing a rich and affordable
learning experience for our volunteers and participants, and furthering
the Earth-based
Building Movement, while getting our Retreat and Learning
Center built, all at once.
This is just one example of how Sustainability is woven into the very fabric of
the Light House project.For us, Sustainability means happiness and wellbeing are an integral
part of success. Causing that in the lives of an international audience
is our way of furthering the movement toward sustainability, on a global
scale.LeadershipBy June of 2015, once Light House is built, we will begin to promote our Twenty-One
Day Intensives in Sustainable and Purpose-driven Living and
Leadership, thus fulfilling our commitment to propagating and
engendering Comprehensive Sustainability… and Sustainable Happiness.
Light House will be ready to receive our first formal retreat guests, starting
in October of 2015. At that time we will launch the first of our
Twenty-One Day Intensives.Our Twenty-One Days training modules are structured to balance both physical and non-physical aspects of Human Being-ness by catalyzing guided, on-going inquiries and conversations, while providing an environment conducive to practical application of new skills, insights and perspectives in a sustained way. These modules promise to alter the ways participants engage the world and their roles in it--in empowering ways--for the rest of their lives. Participants will come away rejuvenated, inspired, directed and empowered, recognizing and valuing their own unique expressions of leadership, combined with the ability to apply it in their daily lives. Here's what we've gotSo far, we've got our business plan, a solid standing among the locals, excellent neighbors with whom we've been collaborating for more than a year now, and the perfect piece of property, almost fully purchased.   We've laid the ground work... Now, we come to You, our community, to help us with the next stage. We are proud and delighted to bring you this opportunity to leave your finger prints on this project from its inception. Light House 42 aims to bridge where we come from to expanded horizons for where we can go, not only as individuals, but as a culture. We want You to be a part of that.With Your HelpWith $50,000 we can make the final $15,000 payment on the Light House 42 property.The remaining $35,000 is for the first year's operation costs and building materials, while we ramp up the business to start earning on its own, by this time next year. It breaks down like this:

$20,000 for materials and labor for the Learning Center and Great Room that includes the Community Kitchen, Library, Recording Studio, Media Lab, Offices, and Short-term Living Quarters.

$ 5,000 Operational Expenses for 2014

$ 3,000 To create a Camping Ground to host more travelers

$ 3,000 Solar Energy System to bring in power

$ 2,000 Basic Construction Materials

$ 1,000 Garden Fund for tools and fencing

$ 1,000 Transportation
If we raise more than we need:

$5 - 8,000 makes it possible to buy a vehicle for transporting people and materials

$8 - $20,000 makes it possible to continue developing infrastructure and provide additional housing

$20,000 + makes it possible to realize our long-term goal and open as a fully functional retreat and learning center by January 2015
If we don’t reach our goal, we will do what we can to complete the land purchase, continue to extend Light House's service for beginning travelers through our networks and at the Artisan Fair, and get the Camp Ground built.Our StoryIn late 2012, seven of us, from different parts of the US, each embarked on our own separate adventures, each knowing we were ready for a change. The months that followed--filled with tons of challenges, mistakes, and connections with extraordinary people--grew each of us into the inspired, purpose-driven people we are today.                                 Our rapport and shared paths gave us the confidence to join forces and take the leap into the lives we'd only dreamed of months before.We realized we had everything we needed to make it happen, especially the commitment to this mission. Click on this link for more of Our Story.                         Act Now!Notice how helping Light House 42 to the next level helps YOU Be the Change you want to see in the world.             It feels good to be a part!To track our progress and learn more about our project, follow us on Facebook at our Light House 42 fan page and check out our website: www.lighthouse42.net    Can't donate today?

Team ROBUS are a team of five students from Livingston, central Scotland. We are all aged between 15 and 16 years old. We are committed to raising the funds required to compete effectively at the World Finals 2014 - to be held in Ferrari World Abu Dhabi this November.
We have been participating in the F1 in Schools challenge, which aims to develop skills and qualities, particularly focused around the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) areas.  

  What We Need To Raise
In order to compete, we need to raise £20,000. This money goes towards all aspects of the challenge, including: travel, accommodation, materials and uniforms. 
Funds which we raise will also go to the 'Bloodhound' project which we are running, involving our team working with the local primary schools in our area.


Our Work

We would very much appreciate if you would help us reach our goal.

<h2>Learn &amp; Earn app</h2>
<h4>Motivate. Encourage. Repeat. </h4>
<p>The Learn &amp; Earn app for iPad is an exciting new way to motivate kids to meet and exceed learning goals. Launching for elementary school math (Grades 1-4) across the US, the app allows parents to define a motivational scheme that connects learning goals to real rewards from Amazon's store.  </p>
<p>For example, parents may set up a scheme that says ""If my child does 10 minutes of math for 10 days, I'm willing to spend $10 in rewards."" Kids then start off by choosing one of hundreds of select rewards to work towards (and parents can add their child's favorites to this list). All rewards are clearly tagged with an exact number of days of math practice it would take to earn them. </p>
<h4>500,000+ strong questionnaire designed by educators </h4>
<p>The app has built-in math quizzes designed by curriculum experts - with hundreds of skills across Grades 1 to 4, and over 500,000 questions covering the US Standard Core curriculum. The Learn &amp; Earn app has been especially designed to adapt to each child's learning curve, so that every child can improve steadily and at a pace with which they are comfortable.  </p>
<h4>Parenting magic made seamless</h4>
<p>During their daily quiz, kids are cheered on by our unflappable and adorable mascot, 'Drago', who will remind each child to stick to their daily 10 minutes of math. With his many tricks and gentle reminders, Drago helps kids count down the days to their reward. Once kids meet their goals, the app initiates purchase of the reward via Amazon.com - so that their well-earned reward arrives right at your doorstep.</p>
<h4>Help us get it ready in time for the school term! </h4>
<p>Developed by an international team of software developers and educators, we are working to launch this patent-pending app in time for the new school term. Your contributions will help us complete development and testing through summer, so the kids have this app when its time to get back to school! </p>

<p>Every parent knows (and scientists have confirmed) that children get naturally better at math or reading if they’re willing to practice on an everyday basis. </p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Parents recognize that iPads and other tablets can be a great educational medium, with hundreds of apps ready to offer kids their daily dose of reading, math or science.  In reality though, parents realize that most iPads end up becoming yet another ""screen"" for easy entertainment.</span><br/></p>

</div>
<h4><span style=""background-color: initial;"">#1: Kids + iPads = All play + No work?</span></h4>
<p></p>
<p>When the first iPad was introduced, kids finally had access to a computer like they never did before: a device that even pre-schoolers could use comfortably. </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Parents recognize that tablets present a great educational medium, with hundreds of apps ready to provide kids with a daily-dose of reading,
math or science. </span>
In reality though, parents realize that most iPads end up being something else: Yet another ""screen"" for easy entertainment, rather than than the educational tool they hoped it would be.</p>
<p>
Little surprise that movies and video games are always more fun than math or reading apps are perceived to be!  <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Many educational apps simply ‘feel like homework’.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Learn &amp; Earn app brings
in a strong academic component to a child’s screen-time. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">By turning the learning
process into a game, the app invites children on a
self-improvement journey, letting them have fun in the process.</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<h4>#2: Appreciating work, reward and value for money</h4>
<p></p>Learn and Earn app fosters a bigger
life-lesson
for children: <span>understanding
what it takes to earn the stuff they’ve always wanted! By associating a proportionate amount of effort with the rewards kids pick, kids can appreciate the value of money. The more expensive the reward, the more days of practice as required to achieve the reward. </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">In the end, there's nothing like a reward well-earned! </span><p></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<h4>#3: Keeping parenting consistent</h4>
<p>Many of us, as busy parents, find it an uphill battle to always stay consistent with how we motivate children. Inconsistent motivation ultimately has the opposite of the intended effect - demotivation!</p>
<p>By committing parents to a clear motivational scheme, the Learn &amp; Earn app serves as an objective and persistent steward to help meet learning goals. Timely rewarding and sticking to the budget are automatically taken care of.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h4>#4: Escaping Performance Traps: 'The better you get at it, the more you like it'.</h4>
<p>
</p>
<p>With many folks, it’s a case of: <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">“I don’t like math much because I’m not
very good at it. I’m not very good at it because I don’t like it.""</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Regular, deliberate practice allows children to naturally improve math skills. The better they get at math, the more they'll enjoy learning. </p>With Learn and Earn app, a
child sets out with self-selected rewards and daily goals tied to them, making
it a lot easier to take those first steps towards daily learning habits.</div><div>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 24px; background-color: initial;"">#5: Learning Focus</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">
</span></p>
<p>Kids’ attention spans vary by development
stages. Many children may start with short attention spans, especially when it
involves academic or non-passive activities. </p>
<p>The Learn and Earn app uses
constant motivation to gradually improve and sustain attention spans –
rewarding children for getting closer to time-goals or for working towards
them.</p>
<h4>#6: One less reminder</h4>
<p>
</p>
<p>Kids need reminding. Kids need constant
encouragement. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The Learn and Earn app rewards
kids simply for being regular - that is, showing up to play every single day as
a self-driven routine.</span></p>
<p>One less reminder for parents.</p>

Designed for Busy, Discerning Parents: 
Set it up once & you're done



Every parent knows (and scientists have confirmed) that children get naturally better at math or reading if they’re willing to practice on an everyday basis. 
Parents recognize that iPads and other tablets can be a great educational medium, with hundreds of apps ready to offer kids their daily dose of reading, math or science.  In reality though, parents realize that most iPads end up becoming yet another ""screen"" for easy entertainment.

So as busy parents that want the very best for our kids, we wonder: What might it take to get kids to do 10 or 15 minutes of math or reading? Every single day? Without constant reminding? 

Step #1: Set up your personalized motivational scheme. 

It takes only seconds to set up your scheme. Our suggested schemes incorporate ideas that focus on 'Good Habits' - smaller practice times over more days; 'Better @ Math' - healthy practice times to improve your child's math; and 'Best Performers' - for kids that are ready for healthy practice times over an extended number of days. 
Each parent picks what they know works best for their child.


Step #2: Select skills your child needs to work on. 

Each Grade has anywhere between 100 and 150 types of questions, all designed to meet or exceed the US Standard Core curriculum, organized into 20 to 30 Skills. Each Skill is associated with easy to identify icons designed for easy recall. 
You can either work with your child to incorporate specific skills upfront as part of their reward - or let your kids pick skills to practice on any given day.   


Step #3: Screen among 100s of rewards. 

We've handpicked 100s of rewards for every age, for boys and for girls, so you don't have to spend the time doing it. Parents can screen rewards they wish to exclude from their child's selection. Or add custom ones from Amazon's store based on your child's wishes.  

Step #4. You're done! (How long did that take?)

You can sit back and wait to hear from us once your child earns each reward -  as the parent, you get to approve each purchase using your Amazon account. You can revisit the app dashboard to check on how your kids are doing. You can check our weekly reports to see how your child did in any given week. You can review your scheme anytime to adjust practice times, reward amounts, or skills to practice.

Kids can practice one or more skills on any given day, as long as they stick to their overall practice times. 

Step #3: Practice. Learn. Rapidly improve math.
Each practice session is tuned to each child's learning curve. Drago, our dear mascot, keeps track of time, so kids have a clear sense of progress and time spent.  

Step #4: Earn your Reward. Then repeat.
Drago will let your child know as soon as they're done with their daily goal. Each day ends with a clear reminder of how close kids are to their reward. 

Are we there yet?
We are already running early-prototype tests among the first batch of parents & kids! We're working on completing development and testing, so we can get the app ready by the end of summer, and in time for start of the new school term! 






So your contributions will help us meet this timeline with ensuring that the app is ready when kids are ready to get back to school and math!
The Learn & Earn Team:
Our team combines the efforts of computer scientists, software entrepreneurs and designers - plus the curricular expertise of our content partners, the Gardner School of Arts & Sciences in Vancouver, WA, that helped develop our math questionnaire.

#1: Kids + iPads = All play + No work?

When the first iPad was introduced, kids finally had access to a computer like they never did before: a device that even pre-schoolers could use comfortably. 
Parents recognize that tablets present a great educational medium, with hundreds of apps ready to provide kids with a daily-dose of reading,
math or science. 
In reality though, parents realize that most iPads end up being something else: Yet another ""screen"" for easy entertainment, rather than than the educational tool they hoped it would be.

Little surprise that movies and video games are always more fun than math or reading apps are perceived to be!  Many educational apps simply ‘feel like homework’.


The Learn & Earn app brings
in a strong academic component to a child’s screen-time. By turning the learning
process into a game, the app invites children on a
self-improvement journey, letting them have fun in the process.

#2: Appreciating work, reward and value for money
Learn and Earn app fosters a bigger
life-lesson
for children: understanding
what it takes to earn the stuff they’ve always wanted! By associating a proportionate amount of effort with the rewards kids pick, kids can appreciate the value of money. The more expensive the reward, the more days of practice as required to achieve the reward. In the end, there's nothing like a reward well-earned! 

#3: Keeping parenting consistent
Many of us, as busy parents, find it an uphill battle to always stay consistent with how we motivate children. Inconsistent motivation ultimately has the opposite of the intended effect - demotivation!
By committing parents to a clear motivational scheme, the Learn & Earn app serves as an objective and persistent steward to help meet learning goals. Timely rewarding and sticking to the budget are automatically taken care of.


#4: Escaping Performance Traps: 'The better you get at it, the more you like it'.


With many folks, it’s a case of: “I don’t like math much because I’m not
very good at it. I’m not very good at it because I don’t like it.""

Regular, deliberate practice allows children to naturally improve math skills. The better they get at math, the more they'll enjoy learning. With Learn and Earn app, a
child sets out with self-selected rewards and daily goals tied to them, making
it a lot easier to take those first steps towards daily learning habits.
#5: Learning Focus


Kids’ attention spans vary by development
stages. Many children may start with short attention spans, especially when it
involves academic or non-passive activities. 
The Learn and Earn app uses
constant motivation to gradually improve and sustain attention spans –
rewarding children for getting closer to time-goals or for working towards
them.
#6: One less reminder


Kids need reminding. Kids need constant
encouragement. The Learn and Earn app rewards
kids simply for being regular - that is, showing up to play every single day as
a self-driven routine.
One less reminder for parents.

<p>The first on is ""EGBOSA"", my high school alumni association, which
is working hand in hand with regional educational board of Nepal to rebuild a
school in one of the villages in Gorkha region where the earthquake was most
destructive. The educational board will be constructing the school building and
EGBOSA, on an ongoing basis, will be creating environment for the kids to
attend school by providing text books and stationeries, school uniforms, school
lunch, and lodging and fooding for students during final high school exam at
far away centers. </p>
<p>The second one is ""Saarathi"" that is working on child Post-Traumatic
Stress Disorder (PTSD) awareness in Nepal. In our society PTSD is not taken seriously thinking
that it will get better over time by itself. 
Consequently help and treatment for PTSD are not readily available. Especially after this massive earthquake PTSD
cases have skyrocketed and parents do not have any clue on how to handle it. Saarathi, which is initiated by one of my dear

Who We Are 


Our world is in trouble. If we want things to change for the better we need all hands on deck.
We need new inspired leadership.  We need to invest in the emerging generation of change-makers. We need to empower young leaders TODAY. 

 Youth Allies recruits, trains, and mentors young people from Native, Hispano, Latino Immigrant, Anglo and other diverse backgrounds to take leadership in the movement for social justice and environmental sustainability. Participants develop leadership and organizing skills while becoming  role models and change-agents. Youth leaders work across cultural lines to develop projects that improve the environment, benefit our community, and educate their peers. They receive ongoing training & mentorship as they work with one another, teacher sponsors, and community partners to create youth-led Community-Change Projects which meet real community needs and have tangible outcomes.


Youth Allies is a program of Earth Care, a non-profit based in Santa Fe, NM which educates and empowers youth to create healthy, just and sustainable communities. Your donation is tax deductible.

                – Marco Campos, Youth Allies Senior Organizer and Advisory Board Member
 
The Impact
Since 2006 hundreds of young people have participated in Youth Allies programming. Every year we impact over 500 local teens. Youth leaders receive over 50 hours of training and complete over 50 hours of service. Youth organizers volunteer over 300 hours on their projects. Youth Allies leaders have helped to pass a New Mexico Carbon Cap law, showcased youth arts for social change, eliminated Styrofoam in Santa Fe Public School cafeterias, fed hundreds of hungry community members, participated in local government, staged youth rallies and marches, and taught hundreds of students about important environmental and social issues and how they can make a difference.

                – Grace Martinez, Youth Allies Advisory Board Member 
The Stakes
More than ever we need our whole community to support youth development. In this economy traditional foundation funding has been steadily dwindling and is no longer enough to sustain the operation of our program. Our goal for this campaign is to raise at least $10,000 toward meeting our program budget for THIS year. 

The Youth Allies Program COSTS  $85,000 to run annually.
    
Funding for Youth Allies supports:
Trainers and Adult Mentors $35,000
Youth Staff $22,000
Youth Organizers $15,000
Campaign & Project Supplies $4,000
Meeting Space, Equipment, & Office supplies, $9,000

There are so many young people in our community who know that we can and must change the ways that we relate to the human and biotic communities to which we belong.  They are willing to step up and work hard to make a difference if they are just given support, encouragement, and tools for change.
 
 
We empower and train young people to be the kind of leaders our rapidly changing world needs RIGHT NOW. Your tax-deductible donation helps grow people who know how to make the world better and are ready to act on that knowledge.

school's after-school dance program has been cut and we're doing our
best to raise the funds and make it happen. Manhattan’s Muscota New
School (PS 314) has no physical education program for its students
due to budget cuts--that's right, no gym class! In 2010 the modern
dance company, Fly by Night Dance Theater, did a twelve-week
residency at the school teaching movement improvisation to
Kindergarten and First Grade. The 2011 program is ready
to go. Only catch is, 2011’s government funding for the program was
cut by 100%. If we are able to raise the money to cover liability and
teaching artists, fifty students will get a chance to move
constructively and creatively once a week.</font></font></p>

program is considered vitally important by the parents

Administration of Muscota are committed to providing improved access
to physical education. Because the program is classified as an
after-school elective, it is not covered by the school’s general
liability-- and this is a BIG expense. </font></font></p>

by Night Dance Theater will provide 12 weeks of after school dance
classes that are free for the students at Muscota New School. Each
age group receives an hour long class once a week. During
class, the children learn both body discipline and how to interpret
and express the world around them. For example, we can start with something from everyday life -- a New York City Pretzel -- what does it look like? how does it fold over itself? how we can make them with our bodies? Students explore how to twist their bodies like a pretzel, and then work in groups to create their own group pretzels. <br/></font></font></p><p><font><font size=""2"" style=""font-size: 11pt;"">As our residency
progresses, we begin to comment on what we see, expanding our vocabulary and finding new ways to express ourselves and to create what we see in our world. The children draw each
others dances and dance each others drawings. Students work together
in small groups to create their own dances which fosters their
cooperation skills as they listen to others' ideas and incorporate
them into the dance of the day. The 12-week residency culminates in a
demonstration for family members and friends. The demonstration
allows parents to see the students' progress and skill as well as how
dance fosters growth intellectually, artistically and physically.</font></font></p>

<p><font><font size=""2"" style=""font-size: 11pt;"">In
order to continue offering this FREE program, we need to cover the
liability insurance costs for an after-school program as well as the
teaching artists salaries. Your money will pay off the liability
coverage we need in order to offer the program. The teaching artists
are highly qualified and experienced. The head teacher has a Masters
in Dance &amp; Dance Education from Teachers College, Columbia
University and the teaching assistant has a BFA in Dance from Rutgers
University. Both teachers have extensive experience working with
students of this age. The children who participate in the dance
program are also working to pay for the program -- they will be
selling re-usable eco shopping bags. Teaching artists are paid for
their teaching hours only (lesson planning, administrative hours, and
grant writing are done on a volunteer basis). Your financial support
goes directly to the project  - not into desk hours or coffee
breaks.</font></font></p><p><font><font size=""2"" style=""font-size: 11pt;"">We have also been pursuing other sources of funding - corporate contributions from our neighborhood and a foundation grant. If we don't meet our goal from this Indiegogo campaign, we will still be offering the program but it will be shorter with less impact. With your full support we can offer the program for 12 weeks. The school these children attend is in the poorest district of Manhattan. By offering our program after school, we can serve the students who would not otherwise experience a dance program.<br/></font></font></p>

age group receives an hour long class once a week. During
class, the children learn both body discipline and how to interpret
and express the world around them. For example, we can start with something from everyday life -- a New York City Pretzel -- what does it look like? how does it fold over itself? how we can make them with our bodies? Students explore how to twist their bodies like a pretzel, and then work in groups to create their own group pretzels. As our residency
progresses, we begin to comment on what we see, expanding our vocabulary and finding new ways to express ourselves and to create what we see in our world. The children draw each
others dances and dance each others drawings. Students work together
in small groups to create their own dances which fosters their
cooperation skills as they listen to others' ideas and incorporate
them into the dance of the day. The 12-week residency culminates in a
demonstration for family members and friends. The demonstration
allows parents to see the students' progress and skill as well as how
dance fosters growth intellectually, artistically and physically.
What
We Need & What You Get
In
order to continue offering this FREE program, we need to cover the
liability insurance costs for an after-school program as well as the
teaching artists salaries. Your money will pay off the liability
coverage we need in order to offer the program. The teaching artists
are highly qualified and experienced. The head teacher has a Masters
in Dance & Dance Education from Teachers College, Columbia
University and the teaching assistant has a BFA in Dance from Rutgers
University. Both teachers have extensive experience working with
students of this age. The children who participate in the dance
program are also working to pay for the program -- they will be
selling re-usable eco shopping bags. Teaching artists are paid for
their teaching hours only (lesson planning, administrative hours, and
grant writing are done on a volunteer basis). Your financial support
goes directly to the project  - not into desk hours or coffee
breaks.We have also been pursuing other sources of funding - corporate contributions from our neighborhood and a foundation grant. If we don't meet our goal from this Indiegogo campaign, we will still be offering the program but it will be shorter with less impact. With your full support we can offer the program for 12 weeks. The school these children attend is in the poorest district of Manhattan. By offering our program after school, we can serve the students who would not otherwise experience a dance program.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>As You already may know, there is a lot of suffering in the world, primarily in the form of:</p>
<p><strong>1.) famine<br/>
2.) thirst<br/>
3.) disease<br/>
4.) poor living conditions</strong></p>
<p>Now I would like You to stop for a minute and really think about it: <strong>People are dying from the above mentioned; in huge numbers!</strong> And this is all my fault :(</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to gather enough resources to open a research center dedicated to making the world a better place.</p>
<p>Here are the basic details of the plan:</p>
<p><strong>1.) Establish a base of operations</strong><br/>
There is an abandoned research center some 80km/49miles away from my location. I intend to colonize it. If that doesn’t work out, any hangar will do.</p>
<p><strong>2.) Gather all my colleagues friends there</strong><br/>
Self-explanatory.</p>
<p><strong>3.) Get to work on projects that benefit mankind.</strong><br/>
Using our scientific and technical “knowledge” we would work day and night non-stop 24/7 on creating solutions for the worlds problems.</p>
<p><strong>4.) Distribute the solutions from 3.) to those who are in the greatest need.</strong></p>
<p>So far, I hope You are seeing the potential of this and approve of my plan. Again, kudos to You for taking the time to read this.<br/>
Now, prepare Yourself to be blown away; here comes the list of specific projects I intend to do and would have done a long time ago, if only there were enough resources :( They might seem a bit far-fetched to You, but please bear with me.</p>
<p>(I) <strong>A more efficient energy source</strong><br/>
Everything needs power. If we are to make eg. accelerated plant growth or water “makers”, then we need an energy source that is more efficient, greener and cheaper than oil, uranium or coal.</p>

<p>(II) <strong>A more efficient mode of transport</strong><br/>
Think flying-saucers style here. Using (I) we will make an aerial vehicle capable of transporting supplies to the ones in need.</p>
<p>(<span class=""caps"">III</span>) <strong>Water “generating”</strong><br/>
Imagine putting a device in the desert that takes the water from the air and converts it into liquid form… Using (I) and (II) that is easily possible.</p>
<p>(IV) <strong>Accelerated plant growth</strong><br/>
The goal is to accelerate plant growth by at least a 1000% using cutting edge hydro/aero-ponics <span class=""caps"">AND</span> growing huge plants by simulating the conditions in which they grew and flourished (Remember the time of the dinosaurs? Neither do I :P )</p>
<p>(V) <strong>Cure for <span class=""caps"">ALL</span> diseases</strong><br/>
Based on the works of Hippocrates himself and dr. Beck. The main focus here is on prevention; making it almost impossible for the body to “become” sick. The secondary focus in on curing the “incurable” diseases. Do you believe that eg. <span class=""caps"">AIDS</span> is incurable? Well I don’t and I can’t wait to prove it to You.</p>
<p>(VI) <strong>Advanced housing</strong><br/>
Based on the works of Jacques Fresco and other pioneers, we can make cheap and efficient housing. These types of houses use less material than regular housing, completely recyclable and can be used in a modular pattern (building cities).</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><strong><span style=""font-size: 13.5pt; color: blue;"">Short Summary</span></strong></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style="""">My name is Sam Gerstein and I have spent years in the health care field helping people with many physical ailments. About 10 years ago I grew frustrated because I suspected something more was going on with these physical illnesses. I began to ask people about their stress levels while treating them. Interestingly, <strong>work stress</strong> topped the list of stressors in people's lives. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style="""">Work stress not only stresses people but it makes many physically sick. Over two thirds of people going to family practice offices have stress related illnesses! I was very motivated to get to the root cause and find ways to help these people decrease all this work stress. I figured if people loved what they were doing at work their work stress would fall and their overall satisfaction and happiness would improve. </span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-weight: normal;""></span></p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 10.0pt; font-weight: normal;"">I studied people in their Dream Careers for over 3 years and learned how they did it. I then created a program to help others do it too. I have been using this program successfully for 6 years in my private practice and now want to make it available to a larger audience.  </span></h3>
<h3> </h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style="""">This program is a passion for me because I switched my career and discovered my Dream Career <strong><em style="""">- It is helping people find theirs!</em></strong> I am absolutely enthused when I help someone overcome self-limiting beliefs and see their own potential. That is what this program does. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style="""">You will be doing an incredible service by contributing to this campaign. It can make a huge difference in people's lives. It can give people meaning to their work instead of just putting in time. It can make them happier and healthier.

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style="""">We need $50,000 for post-production costs. We estimate that the huge amount of video we shot will require over 130 hours of editing. We will be hiring a professional speaker to add in specific learning points along the way, to help people get the most out of each week. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style="""">We need the funds to create a website and market this program. We feel that this is truly a unique program that speaks to many different learning styles and we will need to get the word out so people understand just what we have here. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style="""">Here are some perks that you will get when you help us make this dream a reality:</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">For helping us with this campaign we will be giving specialty Dreams For Real Calendars with inspirational quotes, T-shirts with slogans that are used in the Discovery program itself,</p>
<p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">on-screen video program credits</p>
<p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><span style=""""> </span><span style=""""> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNoSpacing"">Some other perks include complimentary passes to the program and a one year membership in the Dreams For Real membership site. In addition if you represent a group involved in career change, such as students, educators, or people in mid-life crisis, I will deliver a one-day introductory seminar on how to get started in discovering your Dream Career and how to begin dealing with the biggest obstacles in your way.</p>
<p class=""MsoNoSpacing""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style="""">If we don't reach our entire goal we will use whatever funds we have to move this project forward. It may be delayed but I am determined to make it. So many people suffer needlessly in jobs they dislike and tolerate at best. We feel this program will go a long way to helping those people get unstuck and find a career they always wanted but didn't know how what it was. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNoSpacing""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNoSpacing""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><strong><span style=""font-size: 13.5pt; color: blue;"">The Impact</span></strong></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style="""">I have found that so many people are dissatisfied with their work. This has led to high work stress and many illnesses including chronic neck and back pain, headaches, frequent colds, high blood pressure, depression, burnout and many more.

</div></div>","Short Summary
My name is Sam Gerstein and I have spent years in the health care field helping people with many physical ailments. About 10 years ago I grew frustrated because I suspected something more was going on with these physical illnesses. I began to ask people about their stress levels while treating them. Interestingly, work stress topped the list of stressors in people's lives. 
Work stress not only stresses people but it makes many physically sick. Over two thirds of people going to family practice offices have stress related illnesses! I was very motivated to get to the root cause and find ways to help these people decrease all this work stress. I figured if people loved what they were doing at work their work stress would fall and their overall satisfaction and happiness would improve. 



 

I studied people in their Dream Careers for over 3 years and learned how they did it. I then created a program to help others do it too. I have been using this program successfully for 6 years in my private practice and now want to make it available to a larger audience.  
 
This program is a passion for me because I switched my career and discovered my Dream Career - It is helping people find theirs! I am absolutely enthused when I help someone overcome self-limiting beliefs and see their own potential. That is what this program does. 
You will be doing an incredible service by contributing to this campaign. It can make a huge difference in people's lives. It can give people meaning to their work instead of just putting in time. It can make them happier and healthier. I want to thank you in advance for helping to make this dream a reality.    
 
 
 What We Need & What You Get
We need $50,000 for post-production costs. We estimate that the huge amount of video we shot will require over 130 hours of editing. We will be hiring a professional speaker to add in specific learning points along the way, to help people get the most out of each week. 
We need the funds to create a website and market this program. We feel that this is truly a unique program that speaks to many different learning styles and we will need to get the word out so people understand just what we have here. 
Here are some perks that you will get when you help us make this dream a reality:
For helping us with this campaign we will be giving specialty Dreams For Real Calendars with inspirational quotes, T-shirts with slogans that are used in the Discovery program itself,
on-screen video program credits
  
Some other perks include complimentary passes to the program and a one year membership in the Dreams For Real membership site. In addition if you represent a group involved in career change, such as students, educators, or people in mid-life crisis, I will deliver a one-day introductory seminar on how to get started in discovering your Dream Career and how to begin dealing with the biggest obstacles in your way.
 
If we don't reach our entire goal we will use whatever funds we have to move this project forward. It may be delayed but I am determined to make it. So many people suffer needlessly in jobs they dislike and tolerate at best. We feel this program will go a long way to helping those people get unstuck and find a career they always wanted but didn't know how what it was. 
 
 
The Impact
I have found that so many people are dissatisfied with their work. This has led to high work stress and many illnesses including chronic neck and back pain, headaches, frequent colds, high blood pressure, depression, burnout and many more. It is a silent epidemic that affects over two-thirds of workers worldwide. 
You may ask why do people put up with this if it is making them sick. I have found that the number one reason is that most people do not know what they want to do in life! This is because no one has ever guided them in the right way.

<p>Radar is
international organisation that trains citizen journalists to report from the
most isolated and under-represented communities in the world, using basic mobile
phones. Our work stretches across Sierra Leone, Kenya, India and the UK.</p>
<p>We work with
vulnerable populations who are often excluded from mainstream media, including
people with disabilities, rural villagers and slum dwellers, particularly women
and girls, and minority groups helping them tackle more sensitive subjects -
including corruption, gender violence and slavery. We need to protect them
further and help them share their stories to an even wider audience.</p>
<p>To do this,
we have teamed up with a small group of web developers to design what is
essentially a new mobile app. This will allow our reporters to send us
information for the price of a local text without needing internet access. It
means we will get more news from them and even faster. </p>
<p>We have
built a prototype and now need to raise £11,500 to take this onto the next
stage. This will be match-funded by a donor, giving us the full £23,000 needed
to trial and launch by the end of this year. </p>
<h3><b>Our project: the long version</b></h3>
<p><b>The problem </b></p>
<p>The Universal
Declaration of Human Rights protects the right of every individual or community
to speak and be heard. Yet those who are most vulnerable in our world are also
the least likely to have the tools needed to record or report their
experiences. With two thirds of the world still not online and 1.7 billion
people living off-grid, digital connectivity is still the privilege of an elite
few. Access to communication tools is largely determined by gender, class and
location. When large percentages of populations cannot communicate, democracy
is diluted and development is stunted. Corruption and abuse go unreported,
successes and innovation go unnoticed and opinions remain undocumented. </p>
<p>Radar aims
to challenge stereotypes in the media, open up the flow of critical news and
give more people a chance to engage in meaningful dialogue. We champion the
voices of the people being heard.</p>
<p><b>The solution</b></p>
<p>Mobile is
the most accessible tool for communication worldwide. More than three quarters
of the world’s people have access to mobile phones. It is cheap, available and
can be used by people with low levels of literacy or disabilities.</p>
<p>When
accompanied by training and support, mobile offers a powerful opportunity to
bridge the digital gap and source news from different areas.</p>
<p>Radar works
with community groups and local organisations to deliver training workshops
that offer core journalistic skills, geared towards mobile reporting. Trainees
learn the basic principles of sourcing and verifying information, and producing
balanced, impartial news. Each reporter is then connected to Radar’s central
news hub via mobile. The hub can verify reports, offer editorial support, and
then share their news online and with leading media outlets. We link reporters
with editors and journalists who can offer mentoring and collaborate with them
to produce high quality media from their communities .</p>
<p>Within our
first year, Radar has covered two African elections and supported more than 250
citizen mobile reporters to share more than 2,000 mobile reports across social
media sites. Their work has been published by leading media outlets including
the Guardian, the New Internationalist and the Ecologist with others
contributing to the BBC World Service and international television features.
The media they produced has been seen by over a million people. We regularly
pitch reporters' stories and win them paid commissions and work as fixers.</p>
<p>Many of the
stories uncovered by our reporters have been picked up by major institutions
including the EU election observation teams, advocacy organisations and policy
networks. Most of the communities we work with live off grid, in slums or
rural areas. Over half are women or girls, and over a third have a physical or
sensory disability.</p>
<p><b>Who are
we? </b></p>
<p>Radar was
founded by Alice Klein and Libby Powell, freelance journalists with extensive experience of running projects in hostile environments and producing media for the international press.</p>
<p>In its first
year, Radar won the Guardian Tech Talent competition and was shortlisted for
the Nominet Trust NT100 longlist of 100 Top Social Innovations with Digital
Technology. The organisation and its founders were recently named in
journalism.co.uk's Top 50 Female Innovators in Digital Journalism.</p>
<p><b>How can I
help?</b></p>
<p>100% of the
money you donate will go towards the development of a new digital platform that
will connect our reporters to Radar's central news hub as swiftly and securely
as possible. It will allow us to work with a greater number of reporters
simultaneously. Most importantly, their data won't be owned by an external
group - which could potentially remove the software and cut off our lifeline to
our reporters, or access the information they are transmitting and compromise
their security. </p>
<p>We need a
total of £23,000 to finish the development, test it and launch it by the end of

We're students and soon-to-be students. We're award-winners, idealists, pragmatists, skeptics, and, more than anything, obsessed with the world of tomorrow. We run a free conference called Skeptech, held the first weekend each April.Skeptech explores the intersections between science, critical thinking, and innovation in addressing some of the most pressing societal and environmental problems humanity faces today. It's an accessible space for students, bloggers, activists, scientists, engineers, and other geeks to network, see some pretty awesome talks, and meet some pretty cool people. Skeptech is fundamentally a balance between a desire to inspire people and offering them practical information with which to act upon that inspiration. Held at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, this three-day conference aims to spark ideas, foster questions, and start conversations on the role of technology in improving, and ensuring there is, a tomorrow. So we're like TED, but with attitude. The DetailsWebsite: skep-tech.comDate: April 4-6th, 2014Location: University of Minnesota campus, Minneapolis, MNOur HistoryThe first Skeptech was awesome and we couldn't have done it without our community's support. Here are some numbers:

This is a 9 month journey into village culture, nature connection, mentoring, leadership, permaculture, and community building. We meet 3 days a week. My tuition is $8,300 and I need to raise $10,000 which would cover Indiegogo's fees and a bit of living expenses throughout the year. I've already raised $1500 and have $8500 left.</p><p>I see the Fire Tender's track as a key next step in my path in helping build healthy community through co-creating an organization that facilitates programs for youth and adults that share this educational model and these practices. The Fire Tender track of the WE Immersion will give me the skills of team leadership, facilitation, and creating the container for this model of experiential nature based education. <br/></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I know it takes many of us working together.

I can now say that something that was missing was a deep connection to myself and the world around me. I realized I wanted to learn a different way of life than I had been living, a way that allows for the health and happiness of all of life.....myself, the people, the animals, the land, and those generations that will be born long after I'm gone. My journey became a quest of self-discovery, health, and happiness. It has taken me to Southwest WI, New Mexico, and now California. It's been healing, fun, challenging, scary, and awakening. I am grateful for it all. </span></span></p><p>Through it all, I've learned a lot about myself and what I want to be doing in life. Along with wanting to have a family, I also see my life's path as helping create a culture that works for all of life.....where myself, my children, the people, and the land is thriving, and when I leave this world, I left it better than I found it. I'm learning it takes cultivating good relationships and connection, it takes each of us cultivating good relationships to ourselves, to our communities, and to nature. It takes passing this connection on to the younger ones. </p><p>Over the past year, I completed a 9 month journey in the Weaving Earth Immersion, which teaches, through both lecture and hands on experience, a multicultural mentoring model that helps cultivate these healthy relationships and a regenerative culture, leading to healthy people, healthy communities, and the health of the land. I am continuing onto a 2nd year of Weaving Earth, which started Sept 3rd. </p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">My plan after Weaving Earth is to pay it forward.

The 2nd year experience will allow me to deepen in the Weaving Earth core curriculum and give me the hands on experience of learning the skills and tools of facilitation, leadership, and working in a team setting. </span></p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What is this all about?</h2><p></p><p>Please check out these links and explore the website to get to know the folks at Weaving Earth and what the Immersion is all about.  Weaving Earth is an alternative education model that runs for 9 months as a semi-residential program meeting weekly for 3 days.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.  I am feeling grateful for the support I've received in many ways in my life, and I am grateful for the support I know I will continue to receive in it's many forms.  I am especially thankful for my family, loved ones, and ancestors that allowed my life and it's continual unfolding to be possible and who continue to cheer me on.  I am grateful for the folks at Weaving Earth and all those who have shared the teachings that come through this program. They have impacted my life in immensely positive and healing ways. Life is good, and I'm grateful for that. There are so many more things I am grateful for, and I wonder as you read this, what you might be grateful for in this moment?IntentionsMy Intentions for this fundraising project:1. Raise money to help support this next step of my life's path: specifically, my 2nd year tuition for the Weaving Earth Immersion......which is supporting my larger vision of helping create a village culture........one that is regenerative for all life.2.  May my story I share within this fundraising project serve as a path for deeper connection in it's many forms.
3. To share a piece of my story, especially for those loved ones who may not have heard any part of this story of my life.
The Short StoryFor the folks who may not want to read the more in depth story that is below, here is a short version:My vision for my life's work is to bring the ways of the village back into our culture, to help create a culture that works for all life, the people, the animals, the land, and the future generations.  My next step of living this vision is participating in the Fire Tender's track (2nd year) of the Weaving Earth (WE) Immersion. This is a 9 month journey into village culture, nature connection, mentoring, leadership, permaculture, and community building. We meet 3 days a week. My tuition is $8,300 and I need to raise $10,000 which would cover Indiegogo's fees and a bit of living expenses throughout the year. I've already raised $1500 and have $8500 left.I see the Fire Tender's track as a key next step in my path in helping build healthy community through co-creating an organization that facilitates programs for youth and adults that share this educational model and these practices. The Fire Tender track of the WE Immersion will give me the skills of team leadership, facilitation, and creating the container for this model of experiential nature based education. I know it takes many of us working together. There are many ways to invest both financially and non-financially. See ""asking for support"" section below for more details. Thank you for your time in reading this and for any ways that you might offer support. If you feel inspired by or interested in this vision, please feel free to contact me and tell me about it or to ask any questions.  In Gratitude, Heather, (575) 519-9513, butrfly2hmh@yahoo.comBelow is some more of the story that I am really excited and happy to share. If you dont have time for that, skip on down to the ""asking for support"" section.My StoryIt feels important to tell you where and who I come from. I was born in Springfield, IL. My ancestors come from Germany, Scotland, England, and France. I am daughter to Lori Valentine and Stewart Hutchinson. I am granddaughter to Bertha and Alfred Hostick, John Hutchinson, the late Thelma Crane, and the late James Weatherford. My name is Heather Marie Hutchinson. I spent most of my life in the Midwest up until 5 years ago, in which I did an unusual, amazing, and scary thing, I left the life I knew.  After completing graduate school for Counseling Psychology and getting a job in that field, I realized I wasn't happy, something was missing. I can now say that something that was missing was a deep connection to myself and the world around me. I realized I wanted to learn a different way of life than I had been living, a way that allows for the health and happiness of all of life.....myself, the people, the animals, the land, and those generations that will be born long after I'm gone. My journey became a quest of self-discovery, health, and happiness. It has taken me to Southwest WI, New Mexico, and now California. It's been healing, fun, challenging, scary, and awakening. I am grateful for it all. Through it all, I've learned a lot about myself and what I want to be doing in life. Along with wanting to have a family, I also see my life's path as helping create a culture that works for all of life.....where myself, my children, the people, and the land is thriving, and when I leave this world, I left it better than I found it. I'm learning it takes cultivating good relationships and connection, it takes each of us cultivating good relationships to ourselves, to our communities, and to nature. It takes passing this connection on to the younger ones. Over the past year, I completed a 9 month journey in the Weaving Earth Immersion, which teaches, through both lecture and hands on experience, a multicultural mentoring model that helps cultivate these healthy relationships and a regenerative culture, leading to healthy people, healthy communities, and the health of the land. I am continuing onto a 2nd year of Weaving Earth, which started Sept 3rd. My plan after Weaving Earth is to pay it forward.

My intention is that I will have mentors supporting me and that I will be working with a team of other leaders in creating this organization and facilitating various local and regional programs, along with collaborating with other organizations. The 2nd year experience will allow me to deepen in the Weaving Earth core curriculum and give me the hands on experience of learning the skills and tools of facilitation, leadership, and working in a team setting. What is this all about?Please check out these links and explore the website to get to know the folks at Weaving Earth and what the Immersion is all about.  Weaving Earth is an alternative education model that runs for 9 months as a semi-residential program meeting weekly for 3 days.

the developing world, along with a growing frustration over corruption and
waste of aid distribution by governments and large NGOs. Blue Skies offers
tuition-free education to Cambodia’s most underprivileged children and social
services to their parents and community at a cost of only $25 a month per child. </p>
<p>The beauty of working in Cambodia is that you can do so much
for so little.  Here in the United
States, 25 dollars may get you a nice meal. In Cambodia, 25 dollars can educate
a child and give them real hope for the future.</p>
<p>In November of 2011, the village of Toul Roka in eastern
Cambodia donated land to Blue Skies for its first school, and construction
began the following summer. Toul Roka is a small village along a bumpy dirt
road that winds past rubber tree farms and lazy water buffalo. About 500 people
live here, a quarter of whom are children under 14. The school will serve the
entire community by providing the only place in the village with access to
running water, electricity and the Internet. The campus currently features a
library and tutoring space. Once complete, the school will include 4
classrooms, living quarters for 4-5 teachers. These facilities will ensure that
the 125 village children have access to quality grade 1-6 education and a
brighter future.  </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/438391/files/20140316203045-Campus_Facts_Graphic_Nick.jpg?1395027045"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>Blue Skies is seeking to raise $25,000 for Phase II of the

<p>The whole time having to pay court ordered child support, and giving half of my daughters monthly disability checks to their mother, and worrying the whole time they were with there mother, with good reason.</p>
<p> We had to abide by the Court Ordered 50/50 Visitation..... Meanwhile Kerri Drake was receiving State Assistance, Food Stamps , she had gang bangers and drug dealers living in house with her. The majority of which are also incarcerated somewhere as well.... Her house was under surveillance and was eventually raided. In the house that my children lived in with her, the police found assorted drugs, scales, and everything needed to sell them, loaded unlocked stolen guns.... However, Kerri was only arrested for marijuana found in the ashtray next to her bed. Jeff Padilla her friend that she moved into Korbins bedroom was the one that was arrested for all of the drugs and loaded guns. Supposedly she knew nothing of any of the drugs or guns... ""Really?"" <br/></p>
<p>However, She did drugs on several occasions with my 14 year old son, she and her friends provided him with drugs to give and sell to his friends.... She had a family of 3 of her friends living and sleeping in the bedroom with my 6 year old daughter. A grown man, his girl friend and her son.  While my 10 year old slept downstairs on a couch... These are just a few examples of the things that we are trying to keep my children away from..... this is their youth, their innocents she is taking from them. In 2010 She also falsely filled my daughters epilepsy prescription taking them herself and distributing them to her friends...  During her first arrests in April and June of 2012 both between 2 and 4am she was suppose to be CARING FOR AND BEING A MOTHER TO our children. Since both times it was her court ordered 50/50 time with the children..... She's been arrested for Battery/Domestic violence on me, along with multiple drug charges as you can see above in her mugshots/arrest records. Did I mention this is the home that belongs to her mother and step father? That her mother bonded her out of jail. Or, that this fact and information was not passed on to make us aware. It was found out by us on June 24th 2012 because of googling her name and getting a surprise of not just seeing her mugshot from 2010 but 2 more from April and June of 2013. Never given a good reason why we were told.... but, I am sure you can assume why? <br/></p>
<p>Then there was YOUTUBE videos posted by her boyfriend David Linck of there friends partying at her home. David driving the kids to school yes youtube videos of this, Did I mention he has no license and hasn't for years, but he was still driving them. But the most unbelievable video was the one found of Kadeem Vonn another friend of  Kerri's sitting on Kerri's couch, How do I know this was Kerri's couch you ask? Well the wall behind him has pictures of my children all over it and it wasn't my wall.... her boyfriend also posted this video. So this Kadeem ""MO"" Vonn was sitting there making gang signs, gestures and talking smack then about  46 seconds into the video he gets up and then sits back down a few seconds later with a a gun tucked in his waist band then takes it out and starts waving it around at the camera saying how bad he is and that he don't play.  Talk about a panic setting in.... so many thoughts feelings and emotions my brain was going a hundred miles a second.  This was posted by her boyfriend in October 2012. And, still from then until the end of December every other Friday we had to give the children back to their mother.  What would you do????? Worrying every day until they came back home. But it is the law and I have to abide by it.</p>
<p>It's has been a very long 3 years to say the least.<br/></p>
<p> After the last arrest January 2013 for violation of probation, failing her urine test with multiple drugs in her system.  Did I mention she was 12 weeks pregnant at the time of her VOP? No, not with my child just encase you went hmmm?  We have not been together since 2010.  All of this is public record.  She did recently give birth to a little boy. I wish all the best for him. I also pray that there is someone that will fight to keep him safe.<br/></p>
<p>January 2013 We were finally granted TEMPORARY custody of the children, as she was in court ordered "" in-patient"" rehab facility as part of her VOP agreement. We are still in court hearings to get PERMANENT full custody. And, she is insisting that she get 50/50 joint custody again. Even after everything that has happened. This Is why I am on here asking, begging and pleading for help.. Anything you can give will help! As I said in the beginning I am the sole financial provider, My fiancé Mia, The children gave her the name MaMa Mia by their decision, Mia helps in taking care of the children, our home and everything that entails.... Which is a never ending task in itself and she is also going to college full time to become a nurse, and we are now down to a single car, because the engine blew in my car.  Along with that I have court fees, Guardian Ad Litem fees, Attorney fees that I am continuing to pay indefinitely as long as this is going on.... And that has nothing to do with the every day cost of living Rent, Electric, Phone, Car payment, Insurance, Gas, Food. And all the other needs that come from having a family. Again I am the sole monetary provider for all of this to happen.  With that being said a 2nd car payment at this point is totally out of the question.</p>
<p> We do not get food stamps or any other assistance.  Although we have gone to food banks when needed. Many thanks to the Hope food bank in Oviedo.<br/></p>
<p>I believe sometimes you have to put pride aside and ask for help! Sometimes you just need to stand up look into the heavens and shout.... LORD I NEED YOUR HELP! And setting up this site is the answer I got.... So by doing this I am praying that you are able to help me, keep my family safe. Even if it is $1 it is something and truly every penny will help. Please if You can see it in your hearts, to help me keep 3 children who are the victims in all this, safe and to just let them be kids.</p>
<p>truly anything will help...</p>
<p>I am a realest and I know times are tough and money is tight for everyone, Send Prayers and kind thoughts.... or maybe if you can't help right now but could Please!!!!!!  Pass this Page on to your family or friends and ask them to open the link and to pass it on to theirs... PLEASE!!! HELP ME HELP MY CHILDREN.... Thank You and God Bless, William Drake and MaMa Mia </p>

<p>All of the court cases are part of public records if you want to look them up feel free to do so... Seminoleclerks.org or If you have any other questions can simply I will share everything.</p>

 We do not get food stamps or any other assistance.  Although we have gone to food banks when needed. Many thanks to the Hope food bank in Oviedo.

development of useful IT skills, applicable specifically within creative
industries, that will be employed to build leadership and social cohesion
amongst Protestant and Catholic youth in Belfast.  In order to develop transferable skills, such
as computer literacy, songwriting, peer leadership and dispute resolution
tools, participants will use low-cost hardware and open-source software to
engage with the original interactive visual art imaging (GIMP) and music audio
production (e.g. Audacity, Pure Data). We will assume that participants will have no
background or training in IT, music or art. Once orientation is complete, we will tailor specific assignments to
the ability levels of each participant, so that they can each produce original
electronic music and accompanying interactive visual art.  Over the course of the week-long workshop,
participants will work toward a final display of their original work to their
peers and selected public figures, community members, media and industry
personnel and community groups.</p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Why Northern Ireland?</b></p><p>Due to a combination of factors, including living in
economically deprived neighborhoods where paramilitary activity is still
prevalent, marginalized youth in Northern Ireland are more susceptible to
becoming involved in violent conflict than their middle class counterparts.  Since 1998, the creative arts have provided a
platform for promoting cross-community peacebuilding between Protestant and
Catholic youth in Northern Ireland. Community groups have utilized EU PEACE
funding to facilitate traditional music and arts programs for young people on a
cross-community basis with the aim of improving individuals’ self-confidence,
skills and talents, as well as improving community relations.  Though many
of these cross-community music programs have increased trust and cooperation
amongst pre-teen youth, bridging social capital amongst older youth remains a challenge, in part because traditional music and art programs are less
appealing to older youth, or because such projects appeal only on a single-identity basis – e.g. Ulster
Scots versus Irish Traditional Music<span>.  Although
older youth express interest in contemporary music, it is difficult to
facilitate music workshops for teens from economically deprived neighborhoods
because of the cost of obtaining musical instruments and technology. Such
a dilemma reinforces the attitude expressed by many in these neighborhoods that although they have paid the highest cost in terms of violence during the
“Troubles,” they have yet to benefit from the “peace dividends” brokered in the 15 years since the Good Friday Agreement.</span> <b> </b>This project aims to extend the capacity for peacebuilding through music to marginalized youth in Northern Ireland.<br/></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Who are we?</b></p><p><b>

multi-disciplinary skill sets that may be utilized to create original
interactive art forms, music compositions, computer programs, et cetera,
that allow participants to create and innovate within a neutral creative
environment that nurtures collaborative engagement with adolescents from
contrasting ethno-religious backgrounds.  Such an approach to
peacebuilding, we argue, assists young people in identifying similarities and
bridges cultural differences through creative practice.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Public Radio International</strong> (<a href=""http://www.pri.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.pri.org</a>) is a non-profit media organization that engages people though powerful stories, connects people and cultures around the globe, and seeks to affect positive change.  For the past 30 years, we at PRI have prided ourselves in being dynamic and innovative, and in creating unique content.</p>
<p>Our mission is to serve audiences as a distinctive content source for information, insights and cultural experiences essential to living in our diverse, interconnected world. PRI offers the <a href=""http://www.pri.org/program-list.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">largest portfolio</a> of programs in public radio. Our programs are heard on almost <a href=""http://www2.pri.org/ProgramStationLocator/ProgramLocator.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">900 radio stations</a> across the U.S. and on <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><a href=""http://www.pri.org/ways-to-listen.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">digital platforms</a></span> that reach millions around the globe.</p>
<p>April 15<sup>th</sup> is our 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary, and we’re celebrating by enhancing our unique international coverage by building our Global Reporting Fund, which will ensure that PRI continues to connect people to important global voices and tell vital international stories.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>PRI's Global Reporting Fund</strong></h2>
<p>Media coverage about issues of special concern to women - such as gender-based violence and women's economic participation - make up less than 1.5% of news worldwide. <strong>At PRI, these stories make up least 5% of our coverage. </strong></p>
<p>Immigration is rarely addressed apart from public policy and political rhetoric. <strong>At PRI, we highlight the voices of first-and second-generation immigrants who tell their stories of making a life in the U.S. </strong></p>
<p>More people die from <em>cancer</em> in low and middle-income countries than from TB, HIV, AIDS, and malaria <em>combined. </em><strong>At PRI, our Global Health and Development coverage highlights disease and healthcare in other countries. </strong></p>
<p>We tell these stories through our daily global news program, “PRI’s The World<sup>®”</sup>. Launched in 1996, <strong>""PRI's The World"" </strong>(<a href=""http://www.theworld.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.theworld.org</a>), the first public media program explicitly designed to bring global news to U.S. audiences. PRI’s The World recognizes that global stories are not “foreign” and separate from our experience as Americans, but rather a piece of the story which is common to us all. By embracing contributions from its fans around the world to enhance its coverage, and by proving on-going context to understand broader global themes, The World inspires us to respond to global events as we would to those in our immediate neighborhood.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Global News: Important stories need to be told.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>At PRI, we believe that <strong><em>news</em> </strong>plays a singularly crucial role in shaping the way that Americans view and interact with the world.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>
<strong>Coverage of major global issues has never been more vital. </strong>In our increasingly networked and globalized society, what happens in far-flung communities in places like Brazil, China Dubai and Zimbabwe is connected to, and matters for what happens where you live.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>
<strong>Journalism in the U.S. has drastically decreased its coverage of international news in the past 10 years.</strong> News networks have reduced their foreign bureaus by at least 50% in recent years. Media has been reshaped by consolidated ownership, the drive to increase profits, and reduced opportunities for in-depth coverage. Consequently, the news is less able than ever, to deliver the diverse voices and global perspectives you need to negotiate an interdependent world. (<a href=""http://stateofthemedia.org/2013/overview-5/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Read the Pew Research Center's Annual Report on American Journalism</a>)</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>
<strong>Americans know less about global news than they did 30 years ago.</strong> At the same time, we eagerly consume information about celebrity exploits and the latest dramatic scandal and domestic criminal trials. <em>Why? </em>Filling broadcast and digital space with reports on “Brangelina”, Lindsey Lohan and Jodi Arias, is much cheaper than reporting on Syria’s civil war, or reproductive health issues in Sub-Saharan <br/> Africa. (PRI's President and CEO Alisa Miller <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ly7Btx0Stg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">spoke at TED</a> about this phenomenon.)</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<h2><strong>PRI's Global Reporting Fund: PRI tells these stories.</strong></h2>
<p><strong>PRI's Global Reporting Fund (GRF)</strong> will support reporting and international coverage that reaches beyond the headlines. <strong>The support that we receive from this campaign will help people connect to global issues, and understand their connection to international news.</strong> The GRF will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support the production of in-depth reporting by providing critical resources for journalists in the field.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Fund the placement of award-winning journalists in critical locations, to cover important stories, worldwide.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Enable the editing, promotion, and distribution of PRI’s content via radio, podcast and multiple digital platforms.</li>
</ul><p>The <strong>Global Reporting Fund</strong> will help us tell stories related to the following topics (click to see stories that PRI and ""The World"" have already reported on these topics):</p>

<h2><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h2>
<p>To launch <strong>PRI's Global Reporting Fund</strong>, and ensure that PRI can continue to provide high quality and in-depth, international news coverage, we need your help to raise <strong>$25,000</strong>. With this amount, PRI will be able to:</p>
<p>Produce and publish 11 of “The World’s” international news stories for broadcast and digital distribution. These stories will reach 2.4 million people by broadcast alone.</p>
<p>You can do the math. That’s $2,400 per story. Expensive? Well, yes, because the kind of high quality and insightful reporting “The World” does involves impeccable  editorial, digital and broadcast staff, plus computers, microphones, digital media staff, studio space, phones, travel, light bulbs . . . you get the idea. Remember, celebrity gossip is cheap to cover, quality international news is not.</p>
<p>Your support of the <strong>GRF</strong> will be rewarded with exclusive and limited edition perks for our Indiegogo supporters, which reflect and celebrate PRI’s unique perspective and voices.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What story will you make possible?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>PRI takes very seriously its public service responsibility of bringing objective and important information to the attention of people who are concerned about their world.</strong> We’ve done so for 30 years.</p>
<p>With your support of the <strong>Global Reporting Fund</strong>, PRI will continue to produce probing coverage that informs you and helps you become an engaged citizen.</p>
<p>Help PRI shift the media landscape in the U.S. and anticipate and adapt to our changing world. Whether covering global health rights or arts and culture, PRI tells the stories that are important and meaningful to you. You can help make sure they will be told.</p>

<p> </p></div>","PRI®: Connecting people to their world for over 30 years.
Public Radio International (www.pri.org) is a non-profit media organization that engages people though powerful stories, connects people and cultures around the globe, and seeks to affect positive change.  For the past 30 years, we at PRI have prided ourselves in being dynamic and innovative, and in creating unique content.
Our mission is to serve audiences as a distinctive content source for information, insights and cultural experiences essential to living in our diverse, interconnected world. PRI offers the largest portfolio of programs in public radio. Our programs are heard on almost 900 radio stations across the U.S. and on digital platforms that reach millions around the globe.
April 15th is our 30th anniversary, and we’re celebrating by enhancing our unique international coverage by building our Global Reporting Fund, which will ensure that PRI continues to connect people to important global voices and tell vital international stories.
 
PRI's Global Reporting Fund
Media coverage about issues of special concern to women - such as gender-based violence and women's economic participation - make up less than 1.5% of news worldwide. At PRI, these stories make up least 5% of our coverage. 
Immigration is rarely addressed apart from public policy and political rhetoric. At PRI, we highlight the voices of first-and second-generation immigrants who tell their stories of making a life in the U.S. 
More people die from cancer in low and middle-income countries than from TB, HIV, AIDS, and malaria combined. At PRI, our Global Health and Development coverage highlights disease and healthcare in other countries. 
We tell these stories through our daily global news program, “PRI’s The World®”. Launched in 1996, ""PRI's The World"" (www.theworld.org), the first public media program explicitly designed to bring global news to U.S. audiences. PRI’s The World recognizes that global stories are not “foreign” and separate from our experience as Americans, but rather a piece of the story which is common to us all. By embracing contributions from its fans around the world to enhance its coverage, and by proving on-going context to understand broader global themes, The World inspires us to respond to global events as we would to those in our immediate neighborhood.
 
Global News: Important stories need to be told.

At PRI, we believe that news plays a singularly crucial role in shaping the way that Americans view and interact with the world.


Coverage of major global issues has never been more vital. In our increasingly networked and globalized society, what happens in far-flung communities in places like Brazil, China Dubai and Zimbabwe is connected to, and matters for what happens where you live.


Journalism in the U.S. has drastically decreased its coverage of international news in the past 10 years. News networks have reduced their foreign bureaus by at least 50% in recent years. Media has been reshaped by consolidated ownership, the drive to increase profits, and reduced opportunities for in-depth coverage. Consequently, the news is less able than ever, to deliver the diverse voices and global perspectives you need to negotiate an interdependent world. (Read the Pew Research Center's Annual Report on American Journalism)


Americans know less about global news than they did 30 years ago. At the same time, we eagerly consume information about celebrity exploits and the latest dramatic scandal and domestic criminal trials. Why? Filling broadcast and digital space with reports on “Brangelina”, Lindsey Lohan and Jodi Arias, is much cheaper than reporting on Syria’s civil war, or reproductive health issues in Sub-Saharan  Africa. (PRI's President and CEO Alisa Miller spoke at TED about this phenomenon.)
 
PRI's Global Reporting Fund: PRI tells these stories.
PRI's Global Reporting Fund (GRF) will support reporting and international coverage that reaches beyond the headlines. The support that we receive from this campaign will help people connect to global issues, and understand their connection to international news. The GRF will:

Support the production of in-depth reporting by providing critical resources for journalists in the field.

Fund the placement of award-winning journalists in critical locations, to cover important stories, worldwide.

Enable the editing, promotion, and distribution of PRI’s content via radio, podcast and multiple digital platforms.
The Global Reporting Fund will help us tell stories related to the following topics (click to see stories that PRI and ""The World"" have already reported on these topics):

Global Health
Human Rights
Immigrants and Refugees
Religion
Science and Technology
Women and Girls
Regional Interests: Africa, Asia, Latin America, China, and the Middle East

Arts and Culture
 
What We Need & What You Get
To launch PRI's Global Reporting Fund, and ensure that PRI can continue to provide high quality and in-depth, international news coverage, we need your help to raise $25,000. With this amount, PRI will be able to:
Produce and publish 11 of “The World’s” international news stories for broadcast and digital distribution. These stories will reach 2.4 million people by broadcast alone.
You can do the math. That’s $2,400 per story. Expensive? Well, yes, because the kind of high quality and insightful reporting “The World” does involves impeccable  editorial, digital and broadcast staff, plus computers, microphones, digital media staff, studio space, phones, travel, light bulbs . . . you get the idea. Remember, celebrity gossip is cheap to cover, quality international news is not.
Your support of the GRF will be rewarded with exclusive and limited edition perks for our Indiegogo supporters, which reflect and celebrate PRI’s unique perspective and voices.
 
What story will you make possible?
PRI takes very seriously its public service responsibility of bringing objective and important information to the attention of people who are concerned about their world. We’ve done so for 30 years.
With your support of the Global Reporting Fund, PRI will continue to produce probing coverage that informs you and helps you become an engaged citizen.
Help PRI shift the media landscape in the U.S. and anticipate and adapt to our changing world. Whether covering global health rights or arts and culture, PRI tells the stories that are important and meaningful to you. You can help make sure they will be told.

<p><strong>S.T.A.R.S School for Autism needs your help! </strong></p>
<p>S.T.A.R. School for Autism is a non-profit school with a commitment to provide a tailored learning experience for children with autism. Through our program, our students will be prepared to excel in their continued education and will have a solid foundation for a smoother social life. S.T.A.R.S. opened its doors on August 22, 2012 as one of the few schools in the State of Florida to incorporate holistic methods as part of the school’s curriculum and is the first school in Miami-Dade to offer early intervention catered to preschool children living with autism. </p>
<p>Our programs are currently targeted for early intervention for children 2-5 years of age. Our students are provided with individualized learning plans that incorporate a a specialized curriculum and therapies throughout the school day. The curriculum and therapies we implement include a variety of scientifically based and innovative methods that foster positive development and are customized to meet the unique wellness needs and goals of each parent and child. All our teachers are certified by the state of Florida and they teach our students using a relevant and adapted curriculum, which is based in developmental sciences. Therapeutic services at S.T.A.R.S. include natural therapies, nutrition, floor-time therapy, speech therapy, and occupational therapy. </p>
<p>In total, we are a team of four Hispanic women trying to make a change in the way children with autism are educated in our community. We have each had loved ones or have been personally involved with and seen that the current system in place is not conducive to the manner in which these children would be able to thrive. We all share a collective dream to enhance the current system to be able to give these children and their parents a much-needed full-service holistic environment. We also want families to have an alternative to the current system, without the astronomical cost of what a program and facility like ours goes for in the South Florida area.</p>
<p>It is one of our top priorities to keep costs low enough that low-income families will have the chance to provide their children with the educational and therapeutic environment that they need. We enacted this because we want parents of school-aged children to have the option of bringing their child here knowing that their child will receive personalized services and education as an alternative to the default of admitting them into a public school, where luck of the draw indicates what quality of service and care their child will receive. </p>
<p>Our school runs on primarily private donations and grants. Grants we were expecting to receive months ago have been delayed and private donations have slowed to come in. We continue to maintain the level of excellence that we set out to employ and are stretching our resources in all areas not related to education and therapy, to continue to maintain that level of excellence. However, as funds have slowed to come in, our growth and plans to do more have come to a stand still.</p>
<p>Our little STARS are growing, learning, and progressing each and everyday with the programs and resources that we currently provide. But there is so much more we have planned and can do... but we need help. In order to move into our next phase of development for our students, we need support from the community. </p>
<p>Our goal with this campaign is to raise $50,000 to help us open an additional classroom and continue build other learning areas that are underdeveloped. We are a non-profit and we are doing everything we can to keep costs low enough so that families don't need to struggle to provide for their children. The highest tuition price for our school is $1,200 dollars per month per student.  More than half of the tuition expense goes toward each child's therapies and the rest is used to cover faculty &amp; staff, and typical facility expenses. Though our tuition charge might seem a bit steep, it is nothing in comparison to the handful of other facilities that provide similar services in the South Florida region that charge approximately $3,000 dollars per month.</p>
<p>Remember - our students are receiving therapy throughout the school day. That means that mom and dad don't need to run around town and constantly shift their schedules to take their child to school and various therapy sessions around town, they don't need to fight with insurance companies to ensure they get coverage for an autism diagnosis, they don't need to worry about the inconsistencies with the personnel that are treating and providing care for their child, they don't need to worry about sudden and unexpected out of pocket expenses, and they are given reasonable payment options and opportunities for aid. </p>
<p>All the money raised in this campaign will go toward taking our school and programs to the next level so that these children and future students will get more than the minimum in care and education. These are some of our plans: </p>
<p>- Open two more classrooms and expand our program for older children living with autism in the community to get the care and education they deserve.</p>
<p>- Provide a greater variety of therapeutic programs during school hours, but also before and after school, such as; a reading dog program, HIPPO therapy, aquatic therapy, therapeutic athletic programs. We also would like to enhance some of our current therapies; like provide instruments to our children during music, provide a greater range of levels in our art programs, and more.</p>
<p>- Set up an in-house nutrition program to ease the need for families to prepare lunches and ensure that our students are getting proper nutrition during school hours.</p>
<p>- Purchase<span> </span>SMART Board interactive whiteboards for our classrooms to porvide our student with interactive group lessons. <span><br/></span></p>
<p>- Enhance our multisensory room to include interactive components for sensory therapy and continuous aromatherapy. </p>
<p>- Enhance our indoor-gym to include<strong> </strong>more interactive sensory components, install blinds on the windows, incorporate greater safety features (i.e. padding on the walls), paint the walls to be more stimulating through the eyes.</p>
<p>- Begin building our outdoor-gym that will feature an enhanced playground that is fully interactive and integrates multisensory stim, a water boards and other textural stim, and socially engaging activities.   </p>
<p>- Begin growing our therapeutic garden. We want to utilize a garden area for two reasons 1. To build the association of food, from plant-to-plate, while encouraging wholesome nutrition and 2. To provide our students with a tranquil and therapeutic outside environment.</p>
<p>- Provide better and more in-depth workshops and facilitate support groups and adult events for parents. </p>
<p>- Provide transportation as an option to families that struggle with getting their children to school.</p>
<p>- Take our children on more field trips; which are more costly than the typical fieldtrip because we need to have closer chaperone to student ratio.</p>
<p>- Set up a scholarship fund for current and future students whose families have financial difficulties.</p>
<p>We at S.T.A.R.S. don’t want to only take; we want to give in any way that we can, especially to those who help support our students. We can offer promotion for you or your organization through our social media, our newsletter to a mailing list of about 1,500 from mainly the South Florida community, and at our events. We can also offer our time should your organization need some volunteers for a few hours on a given day. The packages on the right are just some ideas we had. If you would like for S.T.A.R.S. to do something further for you – let us know and maybe we can make it happen!</p>
<p>Sometimes donating money isn't an option and we understand that. Even if you can't support us through this financial campaign, if you believe in our dream and want to make it your own, there are lots of other ways to help! We can definitely take donations of goods or services. So if there is anything you have that you would be willing to offer; like school supplies, toys, IT services, technology, facility equipment, food and drink for special occasions, or anything else you could think of. We can also use gift donations that maybe wouldn’t be used in the school necessarily – we hold fundraising efforts like auctions and raffles, so we could always use prizes for these to help us raise funds. However, probably the best way anyone could help us is to spread the word that we are here! Share our campaign through social networks, face-to-face, etc. Tell people that have children with autism that S.T.A.R.S. is here to help children like theirs learn and grow in a holistic environment. Moral support is always needed too, so send us a message or give us a call to let us know that you support our school and its essential undertaking!</p>
<p>In just six months our students have made huge strides. One student that had a delay in speech is now saying words! Another student that would not interact with other children is now hugging his friends goodbye! Many of our parents tell us how proud and relieved they are to see their children growing in independence and sociability. We also hear our parents telling us about how their children go home and teach them the lessons of the day! In just a short time our parents and we have seen our children grow so much… and it’s only the beginning! We want to make our program more impactful and expand to be able to give the same opportunity of growth to other families in our community who are frustrated with the inefficiency and lack of quality care within the current alternatives for education of children with autism.

<h3>Great. Riseup is awesome.  But why are you telling me this?</h3>

Right here and now, having <a href=""http://riseup.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Riseup.net</a> existing and growing is more important than ever. Here's an example why. <br/><p></p>
<p><span class=""notranlsate"">In response to the leaks about the NSA's blanket surveillance programs, a bunch of organizations — <a href=""http://accessnow.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Access</a>, <a href=""http://demandprogress.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Demand Progress</a>, <a href=""https://eff.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>, <a href=""http://fightforthefuture.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fight for the Future</a>, <a href=""http://freepress.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Free Press</a>, <a href=""http://mozilla.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mozilla</a> and others — launched the <a href=""http://stopwatching.us"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">StopWatching.Us</a> campaign. We called for Congress to hold the NSA accountable and to reform the laws that made such widespread spying possible. Within a few weeks, more than 560,000 activists and hundreds of organizations and companies had signed on. 

<br/><br/>We used a Riseup mailing list we knew we could trust to keep our data secure while we organized grassroots opposition to government and corporate surveillance.

If we had not, every piece of our organizing and communication would have been tracked, stored, and likely examined by the very powers that we are organizing against. We were so lucky to have Riseup's tools and expertise to help us.<br/><br/>But Riseup is a small shop. It's run mostly by volunteers using donated hardware and open source software. After the NSA's recent shutdowns of other email services, it has been overwhelmed by people wanting an alternative, and by coalitions like us that want to use its mailing list service instead of Google Groups.
<br/><br/>People using alternative technology and services is great. But the not-so-great part is that Riseup's servers have struggled to keep up with the new users and traffic, so there's been more downtime. And when things get really busy — like they did recently — server hiccups can results in hundreds of emails being delayed for hours. Riseup needs new software and a troubleshooting hacker to keep this from happening. <br/></span></p>
<h3>We need independent, privacy-loving and STABLE technology</h3> 

Given the <a href=""http://stopwatching.us"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">StopWatching.Us</a> coalition is doing to restore privacy protections in the U.S., we simply can't afford these outages and hiccups. But we love Riseup, the people behind it, and the model of an independent email and mailing list provider.<h3>What can we do?</h3>

The solution is easy: Riseup needs more hardware and labor. With just a little bit of cash, they can buy a new server, a few hard drives, and pay someone to help run it all and troubleshoot problems as they occur. We need to make sure that important mailing lists like ours stay up when they're most needed.<br/><h3>The breakdown</h3>

Specifically, Riseup needs a low power Quad server with 16gb RAM and six SSDs:

Riseup.net has been obsessed with providing secure and surveillance-free services since 1999. It is a nonprofit, volunteer-run email and mailing list provider that needs your help. 
Historically, Riseup has provided services to a relatively small amount of environmental, human rights, and social justice activists worldwide, but since this summer's revelations about the NSA's massive spying programs, Riseup has been flooded with a whole new generation of users. 
This is excellent! But it's struggling to keep up with the demand. The small group of hackers needs more hands and more hardware. It needs cash to buy new servers and disks, and funding to hire someone to meet the growing demands. 
[Riseup just posted a passionate reminder of what it stands for and why we need services we can trust.]
What is Riseup.net?
Riseup.net is a different kind of email provider. It believes: ""There is no such thing as free email. Services like gmail, hotmail, and yahoo make their money from surveillance: they build a profile on your behavior and your desires, and then bombard you with advertising specifically targeted to you.""
So, instead of mining your data, Riseup.net exists to serve you, the user. Unlike big email providers (cough, Google) Riseup does not:

Log your IP addresses
Sell your data to third-party marketers you've never heard of, or
Hand over your data to the NSA.


Riseup provides email service with a unique level of security and privacy. Unlike almost all other email providers, logs and email headers contain no personally identifiable information. Additionally, all mail is stored on encrypted partitions and transmitted over encrypted connections whenever possible.
Additionally, Riseup is the largest non-profit mailing list hosting service, with nearly 6 million subscribers to over 14k lists; a VPN service'; and has one of the most heavily used hosted collaborative etherpad service. They also contribute heavily to a number of different Free Software projects. They fund all this by being run largely by volunteers, and relying heavily on donations.

Great. Riseup is awesome.  But why are you telling me this?

Right here and now, having Riseup.net existing and growing is more important than ever. Here's an example why. 
In response to the leaks about the NSA's blanket surveillance programs, a bunch of organizations — Access, Demand Progress, Electronic Frontier Foundation, Fight for the Future, Free Press, Mozilla and others — launched the StopWatching.Us campaign.

Within a few weeks, more than 560,000 activists and hundreds of organizations and companies had signed on. 

We used a Riseup mailing list we knew we could trust to keep our data secure while we organized grassroots opposition to government and corporate surveillance.

<p>Money buys so much more in Uganda and, where in the UK, you would spend millions of pounds on such a project, in Uganda we can build out whole campus for just £150,000 ($240,000) and we can start our first phase with just £32,000 ($50,000), which will help us acquire the land, the headquarters and training buildings, residential accommodation and activity provision, which will enable us to provide the means to train young people to create change.  If you cannot contribute money, then see below for other ways that you can contribute.</p>
<h3>Tell me about the plan - why the focus on green issues?</h3>
<p>A professional architect company has provided us with the plans and visuals and we will be building to this specification, with an aim to deliver a completely self-sufficient site, which collects its own water from rain and electricity through solar panels.  We intend to make the water jars, favoured by Water Aid, a part of the learning process for rural children that visit the Centre, so we can underpin what is regarded as good practice around the world.  Our gutters will enable us to collect rainwater - it rains a lot in Kampala) that will refill these.  We plan also to include training in solar energy as part of our training course strategy, which will in time enable children to develop a career in this area and rural children to be able to assess how solar power can make an impact in their village.</p>
<h3><strong>So, what are our credentials?</strong></h3>
<p>The Butterfly Project is a project designed by Social Enterprise Africa CIC, a UK-based community interest company that encourages the development of social enterprise in Africa and Ashoka Fellow, Emmanuel Nehemiah.  In Uganda, the project is run by Chrysalis Limited, an organisation set up specifically to deliver the project in Uganda.  The team contains a wealth of experience - Grace Ayaa, founder of Life in Africa, which were one of the first organisations to support the Northern Ugandan people during and post the war, Dr Solomon Nkesiga, Principal at Kampala Evangelical School of Theology for many years and practising social entrepreneur, James Wire, founder of Barefoot Power, which delivers solar power solutions but also an ethical entrepreneur and changemaker, Peter Ndelo, Manager at the Butterfly Project Kireka, but also an expert in international crafts sales, Alex Obeki, our Youth Activities Manager, but also the Kampala coordinator for HIV/AIDS prevention activities, Ahmed Ahaad, a national taekwondo coach and head of our sports provision and Bruno Ruganzu, <a href=""http://www.ted.com/tedx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""TEDx Web-site"">TEDx</a> award-winner and founder of Eco Arts Uganda, who works with us on our art provision.  I was CEO for five years at Jericho CIC, a UK organisation set up to empower long-term unemployed people into work before I started up Social Enterprise Africa.</p>
<h3>Who are your end users?</h3>
<p>Primarily in the Butterfly Project we train young social entrepreneurs - these are young people from the most disadvantaged backgrounds that are interested in making a difference to the lives of others in Uganda.  We help them achieve their aims through training and giving them a range of experience that children in Uganda usually can only dream of - you can see the kinds of things we do below.  We support children 12-15 who live in remote rural villages and also urban slum areas.</p>
<p>Secondly, because we strategically locate our project in a slum district of Kampala, then we have a catchment of many thousands of families.  This means that we can serve the most disadvantaged children in thse slum districts and we do this by encouraging the  Butterfly Project members to run activity projects with these local children.</p>

<h3><strong>Tell me more about the Butterfly Project</strong></h3>
<p>The Butterfly Project was launched in Uganda in 2009 after a small pilot in rural Nigeria.  In practice, it is a methodology for creating a momentum for change in communities, by training up young people interested in serving their communities to be a catalyst for change.  We find young people (aged 12-15) from remote villages, interview them and then offer them a chance to be part of our Butterfly Programme, which supports their education, but also trains them how to develop their vision, how to manage a project and how to be a leader.  In return we expect them to deliver their own social project in a community, based around what they are good at.  For instance, if they are a good artist, then they can run an art project, if they show aptitude in computers, then they run a computing project.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example of Francis Ssuuna, now one of our oldest members at 17, but was found, aged 14 in a remote village in Western Uganda.  Francis had developed a level of self confidence at his village school, because he was always near the top of the class, but his parents were subsistence farmers, with very little land.  Teachers at his school were very poor, so we agreed to upgrade his schooling and have him join the Butterfly Project.  In 2010, when he moved to our slum located centre in Kireka to join a secondary school, Francis decided to start an athletics project, which he called Project Circulate.  This project involved many local children from age 7 and upwards, involved them in athletic events, mainly running, and also taught them how to look after themselves.  The project grew dramatically and this year, Francis decided to run some special events for the Olympic Games in London, but back in the slum area where he was now living.  He called it the Slum Olympics and it was to include a special 10,000m run for his members, which we called <a href=""http://chrysalisuganda.wordpress.com/category/slum-run-2012/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""The Slum Run 2012"">""The Slum Run""</a>.  This project raised enough money to support 17 children into school and even develop an Emergency Fund for children living in the slum area.  We hope that the Slum Run will become an annual event, each time growing and bringing in more and more children.</p>
<p>Francis has already been recognised for his selfless work in the Razor National Newspaper:</p>
<p><img alt=""Francis in the Razor newspaper"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://chrysalisuganda.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/press-cutting-francis-port.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Francis in the Razor newspaper""/></p>
<p>So, every member of the Butterfly Project, has a social project like this that they are working on, whether it is in the village where they live or in the slum district, where the centre is being located.</p>
<h3><strong>You say you have a centre already, so why build a new one?</strong></h3>
<p><span>Our current Centre is quite small and is rented.  At the end of this year the owner will be moving into the site himself.  Through our experience of working on the Butterfly Project, we believe we have discovered a unique way of developing Africa from the inside out, through empowering its capable and inspiring youth.  Our new campus will give us a chance to upscale the work that we are doing and expand our reach into many more rural areas.  The campus will quadruple our current capacity for Butterfly Project trainees but also allow us to train many thousands of other young people at the new training centre facilities.  Also, the project can become sustainable, by starting to include school and ethical business facilities, which would allow us to build further campuses in the future.</span></p>
<p><span>These are the different elements we will be including in our campus:</span></p>
<p><img alt=""Four sections of Chrysalis Campus"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://chrysalisuganda.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/4-focus-areas-for-campus.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Four sections of Chrysalis Campus""/></p>
<h3><strong>So, why is this needed?</strong></h3>
<p>In the world we live, we expect people to help themselves - ""not a hand out, but a hand up"" is often quoted.  Sometimes we hear others saying that ""they grew up in a bad environment, that's why he turned out as he did"".  Well, this is exactly the problem - village and slum environments are bad places to grow up.  What is bad about them?</p>
<p>1. Children's rights are frequently abused.  This means children are beaten and abused for no reason, sold, neglected, subjugated, forced to do hard labour.  There is no one around to take their side, so they put up with it.   </p>
<p>2. They live in a lawless environment.  Any crime that can be committed is committed, especially in rural areas, where policing does not exist.  Children sit and watch these things happen and believe that there is no alternative.</p>
<p>3. There is almost nothing around to stimulate their development to be good citizens.  In villages, children work in the fields routinely - there are few books, computers - and in the slum district, these types of activities exist, but the children have no access to them, due to poverty.  Even sport is rare.</p>
<p>4. Poverty means no knowledge of entrepreneurship.  Most children grow up with some knowledge of business, if they have been educated, but the businesses are not creative and they are often performed unethically.</p>
<p>Children living in villages tend to grow up in an information-less void.  Their slum-based counterparts grow up under the pressure of food poverty, which means that money is not available for anything else and starvation permeates daily life.</p>
<p>We believe that none of this is necessary and that the Campus can provide what is missing from the lives of these young people, enabling them to economically empower either themselves and their families or the village where they live, as they become part of the Butterfly Project, developing and implementing a vision for their community.</p>
<p><a href=""http://chrysalisuganda.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/sop.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img alt="""" class=""spotlight lazy"" data-src=""http://a6.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/228755_10150241321793982_3919141_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 582px; height: 437px;""/></a></p>
<p>Every child attending the Chrysalis Campus will be taught their rights, what is right and wrong, given interesting activities to stimulate their development and given training in how to be an ethical entrepreneur.</p>
<h3><strong>Give me some more detail on where the money will go?</strong></h3>
<p>The building of a project like this needs a great deal of effort and support and we are looking at every means to find the money to make this project happen.  We know we need at least $50,000 to acquire land and complete phase one of the building.  Here's the plan of the whole campus:</p>
<p><a href=""http://chrysalisuganda.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/54401-dd101-plan1.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img alt="""" class=""size-full wp-image-1220 lazy"" data-src=""http://chrysalisuganda.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/54401-dd101-plan1.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 629px; height: 1087px;"" title=""Site Plan""/></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>For $50,000, we can build the following elements of this plan:</p>
<p> Kitchen, Office A, 1 x training and Activity Room, Dormitory 1 &amp; 2 (Boys and Girls), Male and Female Adult Room, Sports Space, Perimeter Wall and Latrines.</p>
<p>For a further $65,000, we can build the Chrysalis School for Young Social Entrepreneurs, which includes the Multimedia Library, Computer Room, Storage and Agricultural areas.</p>
<p>For a further $55,000, we can build the remainder of the Campus.  This includes two extra Dormitories, the International Accommodation for visitors, the additional office, the Art and Music Rooms and connecting corridors.</p>
<p>A more detailed budget of the individual buildings can be found <a href=""https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B40ZrVWKIwTCZnM2MnBsQWdtSXc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Budget for construction"">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>This is permanent provision for ever, so what we build we be there providing services to children living in the nearby slum and in remote rural areas into the foreseeable future.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>What sort of things will you be doing at the Campus, even at the minimum level?</strong></h3>
<p>Most of the activities that are run at the Centre are designed and implemented by members of the Butterfly Project.  They are taught to provide a <strong>service to the local community</strong>.  In the photographs below you can see the <a href=""http://acholiquarternews.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Acholi Quarter Youth News"">Acholi Quarter News,</a> a youth-written newspaper, which presents the issues faced by the children living in the  Acholi Quarter, Kampala.  Their next issue is being fundraised for <a href=""http://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/investment/the-world-s-first-youth-written-african-slum-newspaper-1168"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""The Acholi QUarter News fundraiser"">here</a>.  The second photo is of Project Circulate already described above.  Here they are racing at the Mandela Stadium.  In the bottom left photograph, you see a campaign that was run to raise the issue of poor food for children in schools, which was presented through art.  Lastly, the fourth photograph is a project to empower local girls through dance.  This is especially important as the girls are able to get away from imposed household chores for a time and start to develop their confidence and talents.</p>
<p><a href=""http://chrysalisuganda.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/service-to-the-community.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img alt="""" class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-1563 lazy"" data-src=""http://chrysalisuganda.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/service-to-the-community.jpg?w=300"" src="""" style=""width: 427px; height: 351px;"" title=""Service to the Community""/></a></p>
<p>In the training centre, we have been offering a range of <strong>specialist training</strong>.  In the first photograph is Patrick, who, as a Maths teacher, developed himself a Maths curriculum, which was more applied to real life, as we found that children seemed unable to use their knowledge of Maths practically.  The second photograph is of the Ethics Class, where we discuss children's rights, jealousy, punishment, family values and many other issues.  Thirdly is the team who learnt how to produce liquid soap.  Winifred in the middle went on to develop her own business to support slum children, which she recently presented at <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?id=146488822065096&amp;story_fbid=140320159442863"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""TEDx Makerere Hill"">TEDx Makerere Hill</a>.  Lastly, we train on specific agricultural techniques and discuss how they can be used to economically empower a rural area.  Practical training in the field is crucial.</p>
<p><a href=""http://chrysalisuganda.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/specialist-training.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img alt="""" class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-1564 lazy"" data-src=""http://chrysalisuganda.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/specialist-training.jpg?w=300"" src="""" style=""width: 434px; height: 349px;"" title=""Specialist Training""/></a></p>
<p>As an example of how we work, the pictures below represent the values and life skills we instil into the young people.  ""Initiative"" - when the kids volunteered to paint the Chrysalis Centre - was rewarded by a chocolate treasure hunt.  We also reward caring actions, creativity and empathy for others.</p>
<p><a href=""http://chrysalisuganda.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/initiative-and-reward.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img alt="""" class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-1565 lazy"" data-src=""http://chrysalisuganda.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/initiative-and-reward.jpg?w=300"" src="""" style=""width: 438px; height: 369px;"" title=""Initiative and Reward""/></a></p>
<p>Lastly, ""stimulus"" and ""experience"" are very important, as development tools for children and this is a key area, where disadvantaged children out.  Food is a key issue in the slums, so by introducing them to a broader range of food, they can develop self confidence and also develop their aspirations for a better life.  In the second photo, the group were taken to the National Theatre and were exposed to the creative art that was there.  Children living in dusty and dirty areas enjoy the freedom of swimming and so this was a good reward for their performing well.  Lastly, travel is a very good means of broadening experience and this is the group of Butterfly members at the Source of the Nile.</p>

<p>(Note that scores on the cards are for fun and don't reflect the differing abilities of the members.)</p>
<p><strong>BIRDWING - </strong>In the main training room, we plan that every brick will have an inspirational message (and your name, if you wish) built into it and we are opening this up to you to choose that message, that you personally feel is important for young people as they grow up.  When it's built, then we'll photograph every wall, so you can scan to find your individual message.</p>
<p><strong>PAINTED LADY - </strong>A Facebook caricature of you will be painted, scanned and emailed to you.  An example of the work will shortly be displayed below.  As soon as you donate, then send an email to <a href=""mailto:ben@socialenterpriseafrica.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ben@socialenterpriseafrica.org</a> with the photograph that you would like us to use. We will respond as soon as we can and send it back, so you can feature it in your own profile to encourage others to take part.  This first 100 is at an early bird price, so to take advantage, donate now!</p>

<p><strong>SWALLOWTAIL - </strong>You will be able to choose either a bracelet or necklace, made primarily from the Acholi Paper beads and to a colour scheme of your choice.  Part of the money you donate will go to the local slum-based artisan that produced the work for you.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""size-medium wp-image-829 lazy"" data-src=""http://chrysalisuganda.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/p1030710.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225"" src="""" style=""width: 429px; height: 311px;"" title=""An Acholi bracelet designed by Gilbert""/></p>
<p><strong>CAMBERWELL BEAUTY</strong> - You can take this reward multiple times, if you would like to talk with different members of the Butterfly Project on Skype. In time, this channel will link you to our internation network of youth social entrepreneurs, hosted by the <a href=""http://thecitizensmedia.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Citizen Media"">The Citizens Media</a>. This is a rare opportunity to meet young people in the world who have experienced life in an entirely different way to you or I.  Expect some surprising responses. Every member of the Butterfly Project speaks good English and is very used to talking over Skype.</p>
<p><strong>TORTOISESHELL - </strong>We are learning to be film makers at the Chrysalis Campus and soon you will be able to commission us to make films about a variety of subjects and we will be entertaining you with the films we make, some of which have perhaps never before been made into a film.  This will be our first ""official"" film and we will be proud to have you on our list of credits at the end.  If we raise enough money, we'll even play this film in the newly-built outdoor cinema.  We'll upload the film onto Google Docs, when it is complete and give you the link.</p>
<p><strong>ORANGE TIP - </strong>We thought that some of you might be interested in commissioning an original painting.  We work not just with Kids, but also some of Uganda's most well known international artists.  The kids love painting the butterflies, so you should choose which butterfly that you would like them to paint for you and then we will scan and send you their painting for review ahead of sending it to you.  If you choose to have a professional paint for you, then we will pay them for their time on the picture, hence the increased price.</p>
<p>Choose your butterfly from <a href=""http://www.learnaboutbutterflies.com/index.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Learn About Butterflies"">this website.</a> Here is the quality that the professionals can produce, if you ask them to paint for you:</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""spotlight lazy"" data-src=""http://a4.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/299097_10150428082803982_880339633_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 394px; height: 277px;""/></p>
<p><strong>MONARCH - </strong>We want to capture the moment the Chrysalis Campus is built and record it for posterity.  This Campus represents the skills and abilities of a new generation of young Africans, who refuse corruption and believe that they are there to create a new caring world, where people are concerned for their communities, not just themselves.  To celebrate this moment, we will capture it through a photograph and have each young Changemaker sign it.  If even just one of these young people makes it to be a famous social entrepreneur, then you will have the moment, which catalysed this.  With your Skype credits, you can talk to the young people that were there and how the event changed their lives.</p>
<p><strong>RED ADMIRAL</strong> - The Red Admiral is our favourite butterfly and we want to reward people who are prepared to support our groundbreaking project with something significant and memorable.  So, you'll be thanked personally by the Butterfly Project Team on video and your name will be inscribed on the Inauguration Plaque, which will be in the entrance hall of the Chrysalis Campus.  We'll also send you a framed copy of the special photograph that Monarch supporters receive, as a special thank you, as well as some Skype credits.</p>
<p><strong>PURPLE EMPEROR</strong> - As our top reward, we would like to offer you the chance to name one of the rooms in the Chrysalis Campus after you, so we will be referring to you by name every day at the Campus!  Everything from Red Admiral is also on offer, but we won't limit you (within reason) in your Skype access.  We'll even host you at the Campus for a few days, if you choose to come and visit us in Uganda!</p>
<h3>Hold on, what are Skype Credits?</h3>
<p>The members of the Butterfly Project enjoy talking to people from around the world and also like to give their perspective of their lives and what they want to achieve.  It's very rare that people have a chance to talk directly to someone who has grown up in an African village or slum, so we wanted to give this opportunity for those that are interested.</p>
<p>Time is limited, of course and members have to focus on their studies and projects.  Skype conversations are also monitored by an adult, so this requires our management time.  EACH SKYPE CREDIT gives you 10 minutes of talk time with a member of the Butterfly Project.</p>
<h2>What happens if we don't make it to $50,000?</h2>
<p>We are raising funds from all sorts of places - charity runs, EBay sales, friends of friends and we just don't know how much we are going to be able to raise from each place.  We'll keep you informed here, as to how things are going.  What we can say is that if we reach $50,000, then we will be able to build a Chrysalis Campus and then over time we will complete the whole project (which needs closer to $150,000).</p>
<p>If we don't make it to the target, then we will use the money to relocate our Centre and relaunch our project there, renting our new site until we can raise enough for the Campus.  We can still provide all of the rewards, as we launch in our new Centre.</p>
<p>If we reach our target early, then we will add a stretch target to add a school to the campus, then extend again for expanded the training facilities - the details are all <a href=""https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B40ZrVWKIwTCZnM2MnBsQWdtSXc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Costing for Chrysalis Campus"">here.</a></p>
<h2>If I don't want to contribute, can I still help?</h2>
<p>The answer to this is a big YES!  Here are some of the ways that you can make a real difference:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spread the word!  We're not a big charity with a big mailing list and so we start at a disadvantage.  You can help off-set this by telling people about this groundbreaking project, which has already proved its success</li>
<li>You can help by fundraising for us independently of Indiegogo.  A number of people have now done charity runs for us.  Other have given us items we can sell on EBay.</li>

<h3>
<strong>The future of Uganda and Africa is with these young people, who have given their hearts into making this project a success.  In return, we have taught them how to be role models to other youth and how to create a better and fairer society for their own futures.  We need to build on what has been achieved, continue to support hundreds of slum-based children and create many new young Butterfly social Entrepreneurs.  Help us achieve this aim and our world will be a better place.</strong> </h3></div>","If you've ever been to Uganda or other countries in Africa, you'll know what a welcome you receive from the children that live there! Their zest for life is so great and their enthusiasm for activities second to none.

Channelling this vibrancy and passion into learning how to be better citizens of Uganda, this project will help young people of Uganda to discover how they can become powerful change agents for themselves and their communities.
What We Do
Everything about what we do is geared towards positive-thinking, empowerment, capability, talent-development. Skills developed include:


Exploration and development of community-based initiatives for alleviating poverty;

How to each other help themselves;
The importance of equal opportunity;
How we can connect what we each have to give;
Vision and leadership skills for a better tomorrow.

Where Your Donation WIll Go
Previously housed through a small centre based in Kampala, Uganda, The Chrysalis Centre presently has 40 - 50 members and last year worked with over 200 students. This facility will only be available to us until December this year.
Your support will afford the build of the The Chrysalis Campus – a new facility enabling us to not only continue our work, but to more than quadruple the number of those we can support within the next year. To learn more about what the campus will look like, check out the drawing below.
Help Young People of Africa Help Themselves
Each adeptly named after a species of butterfly, SPREAD YOUR WINGS by supporting a perk! (For details on each perk, scroll down.)  


If you support the project, where does your money go?
Money buys so much more in Uganda and, where in the UK, you would spend millions of pounds on such a project, in Uganda we can build out whole campus for just £150,000 ($240,000) and we can start our first phase with just £32,000 ($50,000), which will help us acquire the land, the headquarters and training buildings, residential accommodation and activity provision, which will enable us to provide the means to train young people to create change.  If you cannot contribute money, then see below for other ways that you can contribute.
Tell me about the plan - why the focus on green issues?
A professional architect company has provided us with the plans and visuals and we will be building to this specification, with an aim to deliver a completely self-sufficient site, which collects its own water from rain and electricity through solar panels.  We intend to make the water jars, favoured by Water Aid, a part of the learning process for rural children that visit the Centre, so we can underpin what is regarded as good practice around the world.  Our gutters will enable us to collect rainwater - it rains a lot in Kampala) that will refill these.  We plan also to include training in solar energy as part of our training course strategy, which will in time enable children to develop a career in this area and rural children to be able to assess how solar power can make an impact in their village.
So, what are our credentials?
The Butterfly Project is a project designed by Social Enterprise Africa CIC, a UK-based community interest company that encourages the development of social enterprise in Africa and Ashoka Fellow, Emmanuel Nehemiah.  In Uganda, the project is run by Chrysalis Limited, an organisation set up specifically to deliver the project in Uganda.  The team contains a wealth of experience - Grace Ayaa, founder of Life in Africa, which were one of the first organisations to support the Northern Ugandan people during and post the war, Dr Solomon Nkesiga, Principal at Kampala Evangelical School of Theology for many years and practising social entrepreneur, James Wire, founder of Barefoot Power, which delivers solar power solutions but also an ethical entrepreneur and changemaker, Peter Ndelo, Manager at the Butterfly Project Kireka, but also an expert in international crafts sales, Alex Obeki, our Youth Activities Manager, but also the Kampala coordinator for HIV/AIDS prevention activities, Ahmed Ahaad, a national taekwondo coach and head of our sports provision and Bruno Ruganzu, TEDx award-winner and founder of Eco Arts Uganda, who works with us on our art provision.  I was CEO for five years at Jericho CIC, a UK organisation set up to empower long-term unemployed people into work before I started up Social Enterprise Africa.
Who are your end users?
Primarily in the Butterfly Project we train young social entrepreneurs - these are young people from the most disadvantaged backgrounds that are interested in making a difference to the lives of others in Uganda.  We help them achieve their aims through training and giving them a range of experience that children in Uganda usually can only dream of - you can see the kinds of things we do below.  We support children 12-15 who live in remote rural villages and also urban slum areas.
Secondly, because we strategically locate our project in a slum district of Kampala, then we have a catchment of many thousands of families.  This means that we can serve the most disadvantaged children in thse slum districts and we do this by encouraging the  Butterfly Project members to run activity projects with these local children.

Tell me more about the Butterfly Project
The Butterfly Project was launched in Uganda in 2009 after a small pilot in rural Nigeria.  In practice, it is a methodology for creating a momentum for change in communities, by training up young people interested in serving their communities to be a catalyst for change.  We find young people (aged 12-15) from remote villages, interview them and then offer them a chance to be part of our Butterfly Programme, which supports their education, but also trains them how to develop their vision, how to manage a project and how to be a leader.  In return we expect them to deliver their own social project in a community, based around what they are good at.  For instance, if they are a good artist, then they can run an art project, if they show aptitude in computers, then they run a computing project.
Let me give you an example of Francis Ssuuna, now one of our oldest members at 17, but was found, aged 14 in a remote village in Western Uganda.  Francis had developed a level of self confidence at his village school, because he was always near the top of the class, but his parents were subsistence farmers, with very little land.  Teachers at his school were very poor, so we agreed to upgrade his schooling and have him join the Butterfly Project.  In 2010, when he moved to our slum located centre in Kireka to join a secondary school, Francis decided to start an athletics project, which he called Project Circulate.  This project involved many local children from age 7 and upwards, involved them in athletic events, mainly running, and also taught them how to look after themselves.  The project grew dramatically and this year, Francis decided to run some special events for the Olympic Games in London, but back in the slum area where he was now living.  He called it the Slum Olympics and it was to include a special 10,000m run for his members, which we called ""The Slum Run"".  This project raised enough money to support 17 children into school and even develop an Emergency Fund for children living in the slum area.  We hope that the Slum Run will become an annual event, each time growing and bringing in more and more children.
Francis has already been recognised for his selfless work in the Razor National Newspaper:

So, every member of the Butterfly Project, has a social project like this that they are working on, whether it is in the village where they live or in the slum district, where the centre is being located.
You say you have a centre already, so why build a new one?
Our current Centre is quite small and is rented.  At the end of this year the owner will be moving into the site himself.  Through our experience of working on the Butterfly Project, we believe we have discovered a unique way of developing Africa from the inside out, through empowering its capable and inspiring youth.  Our new campus will give us a chance to upscale the work that we are doing and expand our reach into many more rural areas.  The campus will quadruple our current capacity for Butterfly Project trainees but also allow us to train many thousands of other young people at the new training centre facilities.  Also, the project can become sustainable, by starting to include school and ethical business facilities, which would allow us to build further campuses in the future.
These are the different elements we will be including in our campus:

So, why is this needed?
In the world we live, we expect people to help themselves - ""not a hand out, but a hand up"" is often quoted.  Sometimes we hear others saying that ""they grew up in a bad environment, that's why he turned out as he did"".  Well, this is exactly the problem - village and slum environments are bad places to grow up.  What is bad about them?
1. Children's rights are frequently abused.  This means children are beaten and abused for no reason, sold, neglected, subjugated, forced to do hard labour.  There is no one around to take their side, so they put up with it.   
2. They live in a lawless environment.  Any crime that can be committed is committed, especially in rural areas, where policing does not exist.  Children sit and watch these things happen and believe that there is no alternative.
3. There is almost nothing around to stimulate their development to be good citizens.  In villages, children work in the fields routinely - there are few books, computers - and in the slum district, these types of activities exist, but the children have no access to them, due to poverty.  Even sport is rare.
4. Poverty means no knowledge of entrepreneurship.  Most children grow up with some knowledge of business, if they have been educated, but the businesses are not creative and they are often performed unethically.
Children living in villages tend to grow up in an information-less void.  Their slum-based counterparts grow up under the pressure of food poverty, which means that money is not available for anything else and starvation permeates daily life.
We believe that none of this is necessary and that the Campus can provide what is missing from the lives of these young people, enabling them to economically empower either themselves and their families or the village where they live, as they become part of the Butterfly Project, developing and implementing a vision for their community.

Every child attending the Chrysalis Campus will be taught their rights, what is right and wrong, given interesting activities to stimulate their development and given training in how to be an ethical entrepreneur.
Give me some more detail on where the money will go?
The building of a project like this needs a great deal of effort and support and we are looking at every means to find the money to make this project happen.  We know we need at least $50,000 to acquire land and complete phase one of the building.  Here's the plan of the whole campus:

 
For $50,000, we can build the following elements of this plan:
 Kitchen, Office A, 1 x training and Activity Room, Dormitory 1 & 2 (Boys and Girls), Male and Female Adult Room, Sports Space, Perimeter Wall and Latrines.
For a further $65,000, we can build the Chrysalis School for Young Social Entrepreneurs, which includes the Multimedia Library, Computer Room, Storage and Agricultural areas.
For a further $55,000, we can build the remainder of the Campus.  This includes two extra Dormitories, the International Accommodation for visitors, the additional office, the Art and Music Rooms and connecting corridors.
A more detailed budget of the individual buildings can be found here.
This is permanent provision for ever, so what we build we be there providing services to children living in the nearby slum and in remote rural areas into the foreseeable future.
What sort of things will you be doing at the Campus, even at the minimum level?
Most of the activities that are run at the Centre are designed and implemented by members of the Butterfly Project.  They are taught to provide a service to the local community.  In the photographs below you can see the Acholi Quarter News, a youth-written newspaper, which presents the issues faced by the children living in the  Acholi Quarter, Kampala.  Their next issue is being fundraised for here.  The second photo is of Project Circulate already described above.  Here they are racing at the Mandela Stadium.  In the bottom left photograph, you see a campaign that was run to raise the issue of poor food for children in schools, which was presented through art.  Lastly, the fourth photograph is a project to empower local girls through dance.  This is especially important as the girls are able to get away from imposed household chores for a time and start to develop their confidence and talents.

In the training centre, we have been offering a range of specialist training.  In the first photograph is Patrick, who, as a Maths teacher, developed himself a Maths curriculum, which was more applied to real life, as we found that children seemed unable to use their knowledge of Maths practically.  The second photograph is of the Ethics Class, where we discuss children's rights, jealousy, punishment, family values and many other issues.  Thirdly is the team who learnt how to produce liquid soap.  Winifred in the middle went on to develop her own business to support slum children, which she recently presented at TEDx Makerere Hill.  Lastly, we train on specific agricultural techniques and discuss how they can be used to economically empower a rural area.  Practical training in the field is crucial.

As an example of how we work, the pictures below represent the values and life skills we instil into the young people.  ""Initiative"" - when the kids volunteered to paint the Chrysalis Centre - was rewarded by a chocolate treasure hunt.  We also reward caring actions, creativity and empathy for others.

Lastly, ""stimulus"" and ""experience"" are very important, as development tools for children and this is a key area, where disadvantaged children out.  Food is a key issue in the slums, so by introducing them to a broader range of food, they can develop self confidence and also develop their aspirations for a better life.  In the second photo, the group were taken to the National Theatre and were exposed to the creative art that was there.  Children living in dusty and dirty areas enjoy the freedom of swimming and so this was a good reward for their performing well.  Lastly, travel is a very good means of broadening experience and this is the group of Butterfly members at the Source of the Nile.

About The Perks!
By supporting this campaign, you will be joining in a unique and long-term movement to create a better Africa.  If you want to be part of this, you will join us observing the talented young people, as they grow in their ability to create change and you may even be able to advise them personally how best they can achieve the greatest social impact.
If you are interested in art, maybe you could help Joel, who is using art to tell the stories of children living in rural villages and urban slums.  Read about him here. 
Confidence is a big issue for girls in Africa, as they grow up in impoverished settings.  Maybe you could help Nancy achieve her aims and objectives, as she states them here.
Eunice is a composer and choreographer or some talent, which she uses to train small children.  Her project was recently featured on the front cover of Update Magazine. 
Gilbert is an immensely talented creative designer, in art, dance, fashion design, who wants to use these talents to transform the lives of children in his community.  You can see his latest blog here.
If you know about business, then you could support Manisuli with his tree planting project or Samuel as he devises a new card game.
If you have always been interested in education, then maybe you could help Charles in his quest to support education development in rural Africa. Listen to what he has to say here.
Mercy has recently been appointed an HIV/AIDS ambassador by the New Vision in Kampala, even though she is just 13 and you could be the one that help guides her in becoming a public speaker that impacts on millions.  You can see her in the video at the top of our appeal.
If you've read this far, then you've also read about Francis, who devised the Slum Olympics and Slum Run, which raised almost $1,500 for some of the most disadvantaged children in Kampala.  If you're an athlete, you could be the one to help him turn this small idea into a worldwide concept.
You can see some photos of the members and their projects here.
We have 20 members in total, though numbers are gradually expanding.  With your help too, we would like to have 50 young social entrepreneur trainees by the end of 2013.
Most of our rewards engage with these young social entrepreneurs and the work they do and you will likely be surprised by their commitment to what they do and their positive aspirations for the future. 
He is some more information about the rewards that we are planning:
CABBAGE WHITE - Look in the mirror and see the pride at what you have helped to build - there's your reward!
PEACOCK - We made a whole bunch of beautiful pictures last year of butterflies for a calendar and here's your chance to get your own copy of one.

If you are interested in this option, then you can view the butterflies available at this link.
BRIMSTONE - for this option we will give you a link on Google Docs to the file, with 40 full colour Top Trumps-style cards.  If you would like to have a hard copy of the cards, then we will print and despatch them to you, at the $15/($20 outside UK) additional cost, as stated.  You can see an example card below.  If you have a school or would like to encourage your own children to become social entrepreneurs and changemakers or simply want to learn a bit more about the members of the Butterfly Project, then this pack of cards is for you.

Reverse of card
(Note that scores on the cards are for fun and don't reflect the differing abilities of the members.)
BIRDWING - In the main training room, we plan that every brick will have an inspirational message (and your name, if you wish) built into it and we are opening this up to you to choose that message, that you personally feel is important for young people as they grow up.  When it's built, then we'll photograph every wall, so you can scan to find your individual message.
PAINTED LADY - A Facebook caricature of you will be painted, scanned and emailed to you.  An example of the work will shortly be displayed below.  As soon as you donate, then send an email to ben@socialenterpriseafrica.org with the photograph that you would like us to use. We will respond as soon as we can and send it back, so you can feature it in your own profile to encourage others to take part.  This first 100 is at an early bird price, so to take advantage, donate now!

SWALLOWTAIL - You will be able to choose either a bracelet or necklace, made primarily from the Acholi Paper beads and to a colour scheme of your choice.  Part of the money you donate will go to the local slum-based artisan that produced the work for you.

CAMBERWELL BEAUTY - You can take this reward multiple times, if you would like to talk with different members of the Butterfly Project on Skype. In time, this channel will link you to our internation network of youth social entrepreneurs, hosted by the The Citizens Media. This is a rare opportunity to meet young people in the world who have experienced life in an entirely different way to you or I.  Expect some surprising responses. Every member of the Butterfly Project speaks good English and is very used to talking over Skype.
TORTOISESHELL - We are learning to be film makers at the Chrysalis Campus and soon you will be able to commission us to make films about a variety of subjects and we will be entertaining you with the films we make, some of which have perhaps never before been made into a film.  This will be our first ""official"" film and we will be proud to have you on our list of credits at the end.  If we raise enough money, we'll even play this film in the newly-built outdoor cinema.  We'll upload the film onto Google Docs, when it is complete and give you the link.
ORANGE TIP - We thought that some of you might be interested in commissioning an original painting.  We work not just with Kids, but also some of Uganda's most well known international artists.  The kids love painting the butterflies, so you should choose which butterfly that you would like them to paint for you and then we will scan and send you their painting for review ahead of sending it to you.  If you choose to have a professional paint for you, then we will pay them for their time on the picture, hence the increased price.
Choose your butterfly from this website. Here is the quality that the professionals can produce, if you ask them to paint for you:

MONARCH - We want to capture the moment the Chrysalis Campus is built and record it for posterity.  This Campus represents the skills and abilities of a new generation of young Africans, who refuse corruption and believe that they are there to create a new caring world, where people are concerned for their communities, not just themselves.  To celebrate this moment, we will capture it through a photograph and have each young Changemaker sign it.  If even just one of these young people makes it to be a famous social entrepreneur, then you will have the moment, which catalysed this.  With your Skype credits, you can talk to the young people that were there and how the event changed their lives.
RED ADMIRAL - The Red Admiral is our favourite butterfly and we want to reward people who are prepared to support our groundbreaking project with something significant and memorable.  So, you'll be thanked personally by the Butterfly Project Team on video and your name will be inscribed on the Inauguration Plaque, which will be in the entrance hall of the Chrysalis Campus.  We'll also send you a framed copy of the special photograph that Monarch supporters receive, as a special thank you, as well as some Skype credits.
PURPLE EMPEROR - As our top reward, we would like to offer you the chance to name one of the rooms in the Chrysalis Campus after you, so we will be referring to you by name every day at the Campus!  Everything from Red Admiral is also on offer, but we won't limit you (within reason) in your Skype access.  We'll even host you at the Campus for a few days, if you choose to come and visit us in Uganda!
Hold on, what are Skype Credits?
The members of the Butterfly Project enjoy talking to people from around the world and also like to give their perspective of their lives and what they want to achieve.  It's very rare that people have a chance to talk directly to someone who has grown up in an African village or slum, so we wanted to give this opportunity for those that are interested.
Time is limited, of course and members have to focus on their studies and projects.  Skype conversations are also monitored by an adult, so this requires our management time.  EACH SKYPE CREDIT gives you 10 minutes of talk time with a member of the Butterfly Project.
What happens if we don't make it to $50,000?
We are raising funds from all sorts of places - charity runs, EBay sales, friends of friends and we just don't know how much we are going to be able to raise from each place.  We'll keep you informed here, as to how things are going.  What we can say is that if we reach $50,000, then we will be able to build a Chrysalis Campus and then over time we will complete the whole project (which needs closer to $150,000).
If we don't make it to the target, then we will use the money to relocate our Centre and relaunch our project there, renting our new site until we can raise enough for the Campus.  We can still provide all of the rewards, as we launch in our new Centre.
If we reach our target early, then we will add a stretch target to add a school to the campus, then extend again for expanded the training facilities - the details are all here.
If I don't want to contribute, can I still help?
The answer to this is a big YES!  Here are some of the ways that you can make a real difference:

Spread the word!  We're not a big charity with a big mailing list and so we start at a disadvantage.  You can help off-set this by telling people about this groundbreaking project, which has already proved its success
You can help by fundraising for us independently of Indiegogo.  A number of people have now done charity runs for us.  Other have given us items we can sell on EBay.
