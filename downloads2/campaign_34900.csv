<p>(3) To Pay for Marketing and PR: We want everyone to know about Piglt!<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">  </span></p></span><p></p>

<p>Dreamers offer incentives like skills or products (like t-shirts, original artwork, etc.) they’ve created in exchange for financial contributions from the community (friends, family, alumni, etc.).<br/></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Believers who are inspired by the Dreamers' campaign or incentive help the Dreamer pay their student loans (private or otherwise) or tuition.  </span></p>

Piglt (pronounced
‘piglet’) --  http://www.PIGLT.com
-- is “Education’s Entrepreneurial Piggy Bank.""  No one should be discouraged from
pursuing an education (and ultimately what they are passionate about) due to burdensome tuition costs and student loan debt. Piglt changes the way individuals and organizations (like non-profits) pay for or fundraise for education.  But we need your help to do that!  
What the Funds Raised on IndieGoGo Will Be Used For:
(1) To Grow our Team:  We need to hire a ""Community Manager"".  We also need to hire a ""Business Development"" manager to preach the benefits of Piglt to people and organizations -- help us get the word out!  Finally, we need to hire additional developers to help give our CTO a little bit of a break and to keep perfecting our platform.
(2) To Pay for Operating Expenses:  In addition to hiring key personnel (and creating jobs!), we need help paying for hosting & servers costs, attendance of events/trade shows, etc. 
(3) To Pay for Marketing and PR: We want everyone to know about Piglt!  
Why Should I Contribute to Piglt's Campaign?
Check out the video to see how Piglt is trying to help people improve their lives by funding educations and paying off burdensome student loan debt.


To recap, Piglt is already helping people use their skills to pay for their schooling or pay off their existing student loan debt. (Piglt also can be used by organizations to fundraise for education -- more on that below!
Piglt has two users:

""Dreamers"" = Fundraisers
and
""Believers"" = Funders


Dreamers offer incentives like skills or products (like t-shirts, original artwork, etc.) they’ve created in exchange for financial contributions from the community (friends, family, alumni, etc.).
Believers who are inspired by the Dreamers' campaign or incentive help the Dreamer pay their student loans (private or otherwise) or tuition.  
**Those financial contributions are sent directly to the school or the Organization, ensuring that all funds raised are actually used for their intended purpose.**



Piglt is different!!  Piglt does not obligate Dreamers to additional debt (in the form of lower-interest alternative loans) or to promise a percentage of their future income to investors. 
“It’s counterproductive and ultimately not student-friendly to indenture the Dreamers to further debt and financial uncertainty; there's a reason they are actively seeking financial assistance in the first place. They [the Dreamers] have already spent good money on their education and training and they should be empowered to use those skills to further their careers and better their lives,” says Co-Founder Casey Wallace. 
Piglt is already successful, but needs your help to keep up the good work!
PIGLT HELPED PAY HER TUITION!

Is Piglt just for individual students?  No!
Piglt is not just for individuals.  Organizations / Non-profits can also use Piglt to highlight the individuals they're impacting and the projects that make their organization unique to effectively and easily raise money.  Anyone with an education-related cause can use Piglt to easily and effectively raise money. 
“There are so many wonderful educational organizations that are unfortunately very underfunded, lack alumni participation, and generally need help raising addition money. We’ve created the perfect solution to help anyone fundraise, build a lasting support community, and improve the lives of people everywhere,” says Co-Founder Vidya Chokkalingam.
Is that all?  Nope!Believers can also proactively create their own ""Piglt Fund"" (like a scholarship) for qualified Dreamers.  Not only can Believers use Piglt Funds to support certain types of students (say, fellow alumni with similar interests), Believers can also use Piglt Funds to find (and perhaps eventually hire!) people with specific skills, all the while helping those people to pay off their education-debt. 


In addition to helping Dreamers fund their higher education, Piglt’s hope is that the short-term exchange of services between Dreamers and Believers will lead to long-term employment or ongoing professional relationships.
Piglt is already getting some love!

<h3> We need to talk about the future of meat<br/>
</h3>
<p>The earth’s population is predicted to reach nine billion people by 2050 – and a lot of those people will want to eat meat. It’s no secret, however, that the global meat industry is wasteful, polluting and a major source of greenhouse gases. <b>How can we solve the world’s protein crisis?</b> While it’s possible everyone might switch to insects or tofu, there’s a brand new player on the horizon: <b>lab-grown meat.</b> 

  <br/></p>
<p> You might remember <b>in vitro meat</b> from the <a href=""http://www.nextnature.net/2013/08/worlds-first-in-vitro-hamburger-arrives/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">world's first lab-grown hamburger</a> that was presented in August. This technology may soon allow us to produce eco-friendly, animal-friendly meat on a commercial scale, using far fewer resources than “conventional” meat.

  <br/></p>
<p> Despite its obvious benefits, many people are <b>still uncomfortable</b> with the idea of in vitro meat. Some even call it unnatural or disgusting. And rightly so. Because before we can decide if we ever want to eat lab-grown meat, we need to explore how it might change our society and everyday lives. </p>
<h3>The future of meat, now in cookbook form!</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Using the format of the cookbook as a storytelling medium, the <b>In Vitro Meat Cookbook</b> is a visually stunning exploration of the new “food cultures” lab-grown meat might create. This book approaches lab-grown meat not just from a design and engineering perspective, but also from a societal and ethical one. <i>What will holiday dinners look like if in vitro meat replaces turkey? Would you eat meat grown from your own stem cells? Is lab-grown meat kosher? Or vegetarian? </i>   </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>This cookbook features dozens of recipes that are <b>delicious, uncanny, funny and inspiring</b>. Think of meat paint, revived dodo wings, meat ice cream, cannibal snacks, steaks knitted like scarves and see-through sushi grown under perfectly controlled conditions. Though you can’t cook these recipes just yet, they’ve all been developed with strict culinary rigor to have correct ingredients and cooking techniques.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The delightful and weird recipes are complimented by <b>fascinating interviews</b> and<b> thought-provoking</b> <b>essays </b>from scientists, activists, philosophers and chefs<b>.</b> Our network of experts will ensure that the cookbook is as scientifically accurate as possible, all while remaining lively and highly approachable for a general audience. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The In Vitro Meat Cookbook is just at home with your art, philosophy and science books as it is on your cookbook shelf. As <b>the ultimate conversation starter</b> about the future of food, it will redefine not just how you think about lab-grown meat, but how you think about the ways we produce meat right now. Rather than pushing an agenda, this book aims to inspire educated debate. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The In Vitro Meat Cookbook is divided into four chapters: <br/><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">
</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Feed the World </b>discusses the ways in which lab-grown meat could address world hunger.</li>
<li>
<b>Sustainability </b>outlines the eco-friendly credentials of in vitro meat – and the ways it might not be as sustainable as we think.</li>
<li>
<b>Stop Animal</b> <b>Cruelty</b> talks about the cultural, moral and religious ramifications of a world where animals don’t need to die for meat.</li>
<li>
<b>Explore New Food Cultures</b> presents truly wild visions of in vitro meals. It’s molecular gastronomy on meat-flavored steroids. <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>We're fascinated by in vitro meat...</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Next Nature, the group behind the In Vitro Meat Cookbook, has been exploring in vitro meat for over two years. Many of the book’s speculative recipes come from the Next Nature Lab at Eindhoven Technical University, one of the best design schools in the Netherlands. We've also produced a dedicated <b>in vitro meat exhibition</b>, currently on view at the <a href=""http://worldfoodfestival.nl/en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Rotterdam World Food Festival</a>. Not content with a book, lab and exhibition, we even made a special “<a href=""http://www.nextnature.net/2013/09/future-food-house/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">in vitro meat ice cream cart</a>”, with actual, edible ice cream flavored with <b>bacon, beef and (pretend) polar bear</b>.</p>
<h3>...but we're still undecided about it.</h3>
<p>Just because <b>we're in vitro meat experts </b>doesn’t mean we think it’s the only (or even the best) solution to the global protein crisis. We’re not starry-eyed activists, nor are we bound to the meat industry’s agenda. Just like you, we want to<b> make informed decisions </b>about which meat future we actually want.</p>

<h3>Example Dishes</h3>
<strong>Magic Meatballs</strong><br/>Magic Meatballs are designed to playfully familiarize children with lab-grown meat. Young people are more prone to overconsumption of proteins and fats, and are more sensitive to the hormones and antibiotics used in conventional meat production. Luckily, lab-grown Magic Meatballs can be tailored precisely to a child’s individual needs.

The basic meat consists solely of animal protein, and the combination of fats, omega-3s and vitamins is completely customizable. Colors and flavors can also be added to the neutral base to make the meat change color or crackle in your mouth. Magic Meatballs actively involve kids with the meat they eat, so that future generations will more readily accept protein grown in labs.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/45796/files/20130901030524-Magic_Meatballs_by_Mark_Kanters___NextNature_Lab.jpg?1378029924"" src="""" style=""width: 562.15px; height: 292px;""/>
<p><b>Meat Power</b><br/>The number one argument for eating meat: it provides nutritious proteins
 that cannot be entirely supplied by vegetarian alternatives. Like it or
 not, humans are omnivores. Meat is a nutritious source of proteins and 
vitamins that vegetarian alternatives struggle to supply. Thanks to Meat
 Powder, we can transcend our barbaric impulses and history of animal 
cruelty. Meat Powder is a straightforward form of in vitro meat that 
provides the proteins you need – no more, no less. Meat Powder can be 
used in soups, pies and salads, but is best used in a creamy meat 
fondue. Like the traditional cheese fondue, the meat fondue is a social 
dish best served at special occasions. Pure, fun, and 100% victimless.<br/></p>

<b>Kitchen Bioreactor<br/></b>The Kitchen Meat Incubator does for home cooking what the electronic

of pre-programmed samples that can be remixed and combined to their 
liking. Besides the preparation of traditional styles like steak, 
sausage or meatballs, consumers can bring their own imagination to the 
meat preparation process. The handy sliders on the device control size, 
shape and texture. More expensive models of the Kitchen Meat Incubator 
also come with a wireless link that allows you to download meat recipes

<strong>Knitted Meat</strong><br/>Rather than growing whole steaks in bio-reactors, Knitted Meat assumes that it is more feasible to create thin threads of protein. Supermarkets sell balls of meat fiber seasoned with various spices and vegetable flavors. New kitchen appliances enable consumers to weave meat according to preset preferences. Texture, taste and tenderness can be controlled to create a personal, multisensory eating experience. Groups of diners can even knit their own sections of a protein scarf, enabling multiple people to share a unique moment.<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/163320/files/20131030024017-Knitted-Meat-by-Alberto-Gruarin-_-NextNature-Lab.jpg?1383126017"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>Meat Flowers</b><br/>While vegetarian food products typically mimic existing meat products, the meat flower reverses this principle: In vitro technology is used to grow meat in the shape of a flower.

<b>Meat Fruit<br/></b><em>La Pâte</em> Meat Fruit aims to seduce and inspire diners with an

vitro technology is used to grow meat structures that precisely mimic 
those of various existing fruits such as berries, oranges, and mangoes. 
The result is used to create <em>La Pâte</em>, a sweet-savory 
amuse-bouche ideal for Michelin-starred restaurants. Besides the joy of 
fusing fruit and meat into one exclusive hypernatural dining experience,
 meat-fruit is also a celebration of our unisex culture. In contrast to 
our prehistoric past where men hunted and women gathered, we now live in
 a post-masculine, post-feminist society where gender doesn’t matter

<b>Paint with Meat!</b></span></span></span></span></span></span><br/>Meat paint is a food product for children of 5-10 years old. It 
allows them to prepare their own meat dish in a very creative, fun and 
safe way: by painting! The meat paint lets children put some extra 
effort into their meal, which makes the dinner more valuable and

<p>Like with a regular painting, the child has different colors to paint
 with. With this paint the child can make anything he or she wants and

 baked for 15 minutes in the oven. So it’s not just your child’s 
beautiful creation, it becomes a tasty meat dish too which the entire

<b>Rustic In Vitro</b><br/>Many people still find in vitro meat too alien and artificial to put it 
in their mouths. With the Rustic In Vitro incubator, this outdated 
perception is about to change. Similar to old-fashioned sausages and 
hams hung to cure in the butcher’s or at home, Rustic In Vitro is grown 
in a familiar-looking incubator that reminds us of the good old days. 
Rustic In-Vitro incubators come in various shapes designed to simulate 
rabbit, boar or cattle. The more time it has to ripen, the more 
structure and character the replicating meat cells will develop.

</div>","We need to talk about the future of meat

The earth’s population is predicted to reach nine billion people by 2050 – and a lot of those people will want to eat meat. It’s no secret, however, that the global meat industry is wasteful, polluting and a major source of greenhouse gases. How can we solve the world’s protein crisis? While it’s possible everyone might switch to insects or tofu, there’s a brand new player on the horizon: lab-grown meat. 

  
 You might remember in vitro meat from the world's first lab-grown hamburger that was presented in August. This technology may soon allow us to produce eco-friendly, animal-friendly meat on a commercial scale, using far fewer resources than “conventional” meat.

  
 Despite its obvious benefits, many people are still uncomfortable with the idea of in vitro meat. Some even call it unnatural or disgusting. And rightly so. Because before we can decide if we ever want to eat lab-grown meat, we need to explore how it might change our society and everyday lives. 
The future of meat, now in cookbook form!


Using the format of the cookbook as a storytelling medium, the In Vitro Meat Cookbook is a visually stunning exploration of the new “food cultures” lab-grown meat might create. This book approaches lab-grown meat not just from a design and engineering perspective, but also from a societal and ethical one. What will holiday dinners look like if in vitro meat replaces turkey? Would you eat meat grown from your own stem cells? Is lab-grown meat kosher? Or vegetarian?    


This cookbook features dozens of recipes that are delicious, uncanny, funny and inspiring. Think of meat paint, revived dodo wings, meat ice cream, cannibal snacks, steaks knitted like scarves and see-through sushi grown under perfectly controlled conditions. Though you can’t cook these recipes just yet, they’ve all been developed with strict culinary rigor to have correct ingredients and cooking techniques.


The delightful and weird recipes are complimented by fascinating interviews and thought-provoking essays from scientists, activists, philosophers and chefs. Our network of experts will ensure that the cookbook is as scientifically accurate as possible, all while remaining lively and highly approachable for a general audience. 


The In Vitro Meat Cookbook is just at home with your art, philosophy and science books as it is on your cookbook shelf. As the ultimate conversation starter about the future of food, it will redefine not just how you think about lab-grown meat, but how you think about the ways we produce meat right now. Rather than pushing an agenda, this book aims to inspire educated debate. 


The In Vitro Meat Cookbook is divided into four chapters: 



Feed the World discusses the ways in which lab-grown meat could address world hunger.

Sustainability outlines the eco-friendly credentials of in vitro meat – and the ways it might not be as sustainable as we think.

Stop Animal Cruelty talks about the cultural, moral and religious ramifications of a world where animals don’t need to die for meat.

Explore New Food Cultures presents truly wild visions of in vitro meals. It’s molecular gastronomy on meat-flavored steroids. 


We're fascinated by in vitro meat...


Next Nature, the group behind the In Vitro Meat Cookbook, has been exploring in vitro meat for over two years. Many of the book’s speculative recipes come from the Next Nature Lab at Eindhoven Technical University, one of the best design schools in the Netherlands. We've also produced a dedicated in vitro meat exhibition, currently on view at the Rotterdam World Food Festival. Not content with a book, lab and exhibition, we even made a special “in vitro meat ice cream cart”, with actual, edible ice cream flavored with bacon, beef and (pretend) polar bear.
...but we're still undecided about it.
Just because we're in vitro meat experts doesn’t mean we think it’s the only (or even the best) solution to the global protein crisis. We’re not starry-eyed activists, nor are we bound to the meat industry’s agenda. Just like you, we want to make informed decisions about which meat future we actually want.
What will the cookbook look like? The book's design refers to the old-fashioned cooking bibles your grandma might have owned, combined with contemporary typography and photography. The effect is a timeless design that fits with the speculative nature of the book. The involvement of renowned art director Hendrik-Jan Grievink will guarantee an top-notch result.
EXQUISITE DRAWINGS OF THE DISHES

Illustrator Silvia Celiberti has created unique BIC pen drawings to visualize the book's recipes and products. Besides these extraordinarily detailed drawings, 
the book will also contain a full color section with lush photography and

by a local Peruvian school teacher (Rosa Mercedes Delgado Chávez) and an
American psychologist (Celeste Nicole Marion), Manos Unidas (“United
Hands”) was only a dream to bring quality, life changing education to
special needs children and their families in Cusco. Beginning with 2 kids in our living room, Manos Unidas opened its doors in a country and a region
that put children with special needs second.  
Now a reality,
Manos Unidas has educated over 150 students (3-13 years old) and
currently employees 24 professionals.  No longer
located in a living room, the school, Camino Nuevo, has 30 students in
its current location and the Inclusion Program has 23 students in 4
public schools being taught by 5 Manos Unidas’ employed
teachers.  With the launch of Phawarispa, Manos
Unidas will hire 6 more professionals to teach an
additional 30 students.
THE NEXT STEP 
Manos Unidas’ newest program, ""Phawarispa"" (“Running Together”) a Dr. Cynthia Carolina Cáceres Baker Project, is the next step for Manos Unidas' students and the community.  The program is intended to prepare the students to enter society with:

Transition Education for Adolescents (13-16 years old); and


Vocational Training for Young Adults (17-25 years old).

The program will offer students employment training in 3 areas:
Housekeeping in Hotels;
Restaurants; and
Gardening + Raising Small Animals.
Learn more about Phawarispa here.WHAT WE NEEDThe project opens soon. We have the space for the school, but it is empty!  We need $15,000 to launch!
We need to fully equip a 2 story, 17 room house, the
beautiful garden and small store. We also need to cover investment expenses
with new staff until we reach our target goal of 25 students. ROOMS + AREAS include:
Classrooms (4)
Kitchen
Restaurant
Arts Space
Garden
Bathrooms (2)
Offices
Living Room 
Small Store
The Children of Peru Foundation has already donated $5,000, a portion of the capital needed to start on a skeleton budget, but we need additional funds to launch!MATCHING FUNDSFor every $1 donated, we will receive $2 more from two donor groups (up to $15,000/each) for potential total of $45,000*. * $15,000 (Indiegogo)  +  $15,000 (Children of Peru Foundation)  +  $15,000 (Anonymous Donors In Memory of Dr. Cynthia Carolina Cáceres Baker)  =  $45,000! If you give $25, our donors will give us $50 more!  Want to donate $500?  Our donors will give $1000!

Why 74 hours? Well, I recently discovered this program and after discussing it with my parents - I will only have 1 week of summer left (to prepare for my Sophomore year of high school) if I start this program as soon as possible - which would be this coming week of June 10th.  This gives me <strong>one</strong> <strong>weekend</strong> to raise the money. I'm really thankful for anyone that has read this and hope you can support me!</p>

<p class=""p4""><em><strong><br/></strong></em></p>
<h3 class=""p6""><strong>Who are you?</strong></h3>
<p class=""p7"">Hi, my name is Valerie Hernandez. I'm 15 years old and I've recently finished a busy freshman school year of all honor classes, advanced art classes, and my own artistic goals. I'm very dedicated to doing well both academically and artistically so I can set myself up for the best in college. I spend hours everyday drawing, researching, and studying art. I'm really enthusiastic about animation and illustration which is something I'm looking forward to studying in college. </p>
<p class=""p7""> </p>
<h3 class=""p7""><strong>Where can I see more of your art?</strong></h3>
<p class=""p7"">You can find me at <a href=""http://valerie-hernandez.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://valerie-hernandez.blogspot.com/</a></p>
<h3 class=""p7""><strong><br/></strong></h3>
<h3 class=""p7"">
<strong>How did you get started?</strong> </h3>
<p class=""p7"">I started art before I can remember, but more as a hobby at the time. I remember drawing Pixar (Disney) cassette tape covers on my bedroom floor because I was fascinated with them, specifically ""It's A Bug's Life"". Ever since I've had a desire to grow up and become an artist. Though, it wasn't until my 8th grade year in middle school where I picked up a book by a Japanese movie maker, Hayao Miyazaki. I was hooked. I wanted to grow up as an artist, yes, but now I knew more specifics. I knew I wanted to go into the Animation industry.</p>
<p class=""p7"">I knew this was not only something I <em>wanted</em> to do, but something I <em>needed</em> to do. So I asked and read and listened to everything available to me from books and podcasts to teachers and other art students. I was passionately curious. I started drawing from life as I was advised to do. Which was a great adventure figuring out how to start and finding various paths to take. I moved into reading lots and lots of art books, like ""Drawn to Life"", ""Burne Hogarth's Figure Drawing"", and many others.  </p>
<h3 class=""p7""><strong><br/></strong></h3>
<h3 class=""p7""><strong>Where are you at now?</strong></h3>
<p class=""p7"">I'm currently on my second year of pursuing this dream. I'm still tuning my skills that will allow me to expand my artistic endeavors. I'm in high school part of an advanced visual art program.</p>
<h3 class=""p7""><strong><br/></strong></h3>
<h3 class=""p7""><strong>How did you find this art program?</strong></h3>
<p class=""p7"">As I was researching the web for resources and possible a class I could take this summer to further my goals, I found Vilppu Academy run by an extraordinary artist, Glen Vilppu. Since traveling to study with this artist would be extremely difficult for my family, I was lucky enough to find out that this artist can instruct you via internet. This means I can study under this artist right from my own home! </p>
<p class=""p8""> </p>
<h3 class=""p7""><strong>What is the art program?</strong></h3>
<p class=""p7"">The rigorous art program is 6 weeks. I would be studying the fundamentals of art - which I feel would prepare me to study the figure when my parents allow me to go that direction. It is $600 and the money would go directly to <a href=""http://vilppuacademy.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Vilppu Academy</a>. The academy is for anyone from beginner to art instructors to even artists in the industry. People have taken the program over and over to refine their skills, which I find pretty incredible!</p>
<p class=""p7""><strong>The basics of the program are as follows:</strong></p>
<p class=""p7"">1. You get an assignment a week just like a college setting.</p>
<p class=""p7"">2. You watch a video lecture along with that assignment. </p>
<p class=""p7"">3. You complete the assignment on your own.</p>
<p class=""p7"">4. You send him a picture of your work through email.</p>
<p class=""p7"">5. He then critiques and draws over/next to your work - each week you get feedback (which you can reply over and over again!).</p>
<p class=""p8""> </p>
<p class=""p7""><strong>Some benefits of this program:</strong></p>
<p class=""p7"">- You can see other students' critiques. </p>
<p class=""p7"">- You can chat with other students and with the instructor live.</p>
<p class=""p8""> </p>
<h3 class=""p8""><strong>Who is Glenn Vilppu (the instructor)?</strong></h3>
<p class=""p8""><strong></strong>Glenn Vilppu teaches renowned art classes around the world on observational drawing. He has worked at Walt Disney Animation studios and various colleges/art instruction programs. Here is his website: <a href=""http://vilppuacademy.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://vilppuacademy.com/</a></p>
<p class=""p8""> </p>
<h3 class=""p7""><strong>What happens if you don't raise enough money?</strong></h3>
<p class=""p7"">The funds with stay in a savings account until I can raise enough money to start the program next summer. The program is open from June - August each year.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As an adoptee from China, Bella hasn't been there since the age of 1. This trip will take her back to the province where she was born, and give her a deeper understanding of where she came from. She'll be seeing many of the great sights of China like the Great Wall and Forbidden City, as well as visiting the rural area where she was born.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The Chinese government is helping with this trip, but they don't cover everything.  Bella really wants to do some special things, like having her picture taken with a toddler Panda.  This trip is a rare opportunity, so we want her to have as rich an experience as possible.  Help her raise the money for these special parts of the trip and you'll get a copy of her picture with the Panda.  :)</p>

<p><strong><strong><strong><span>Who we are?</span><br/><br/></strong></strong></strong>Missions de Solidarite Responsable International is a youth driven charity organization established in 2009. <br/><br/>We are a group of young passionate students and professionals that doesn’t want to just sit around and watch as the world goes by.

We hope that the will grow into individuals with positive values and an appreciation of helping others. <br/><br/>Our main work is done abroad in developing countries during one-month summer missions. In Haiti, Ghana and Laos, we work hand in hand with existing structures such as grassroots organizations, high schools, orphanages, hospitals and community centers. Our missions involve educational and environmental development through science, theater, humanities and martial arts workshops for the youth and the educators, as well as tree planting projects. <br/><br/>Furthermore, we offer a unique medical internship program that provides an exceptional opportunity for medical students to shadow physicians in their daily routines and see firsthand the work they do. These future doctors learn about the functioning of a hospital along with helping and gaining an insight of the work, such as setting up mobile clinics in rural or deprived areas. These missions give these young medical students the opportunity to learn in a different environment, invest in their potential and it encourages them to come back and volunteer as fully qualified doctors in the future.</p>
<p><strong><strong><strong><br/><br/><span>How we make a difference?</span><br/><br/></strong></strong></strong>We understand that serious problems require seriously committed individuals who want to do their best. For this reason, at MSR the process of selecting a volunteer is very important. Our volunteers go through a unique cultural training prior and throughout their missions. This eye opening, personal and career building experience allows them to contribute to the development of the communities while obtaining new skills. The structure of our missions initiates an exchange of knowledge, culture and a positive interaction that mutually benefits the communities, volunteers and our partners.</p>

We hope that the will grow into individuals with positive values and an appreciation of helping others. Our main work is done abroad in developing countries during one-month summer missions. In Haiti, Ghana and Laos, we work hand in hand with existing structures such as grassroots organizations, high schools, orphanages, hospitals and community centers. Our missions involve educational and environmental development through science, theater, humanities and martial arts workshops for the youth and the educators, as well as tree planting projects. Furthermore, we offer a unique medical internship program that provides an exceptional opportunity for medical students to shadow physicians in their daily routines and see firsthand the work they do. These future doctors learn about the functioning of a hospital along with helping and gaining an insight of the work, such as setting up mobile clinics in rural or deprived areas. These missions give these young medical students the opportunity to learn in a different environment, invest in their potential and it encourages them to come back and volunteer as fully qualified doctors in the future.
How we make a difference?We understand that serious problems require seriously committed individuals who want to do their best. For this reason, at MSR the process of selecting a volunteer is very important. Our volunteers go through a unique cultural training prior and throughout their missions. This eye opening, personal and career building experience allows them to contribute to the development of the communities while obtaining new skills. The structure of our missions initiates an exchange of knowledge, culture and a positive interaction that mutually benefits the communities, volunteers and our partners.
We don't believe in charity for charity' sake. MSR has three main philosophies:


MSR is committed to express transparency and accountability in all of our work.

We envision that our volunteers will build on their experiences with MSR and use their cultural, personal and professional training to become citizens with a more responsible vision and increased awareness of today's developing world and its issues. Our vision of sustainable development is that our volunteers will in turn grow into great leaders and will use their skills to improve our world.

We believe that by providing real and relevant knowledge to the communities in need, we truly empower them to continue helping themselves once we leave. We hope our work helps them to realize their potential and continue building their communities today and into the future.
Why we need your help?For the last three years, our hard working founders, directors and small local fundraisers, have been the backbone of funding MSR. But we hope that via our Indiegogo exposure we will find people that believe in our cause and will help support our programs.By the end of this campaign, your valuable donations will be solely for mission activities in Haiti and Ghana. The breakdown consists of:


6000$= mission costs in Ghana well as the supplies for the organization of a mobile clinic in the Volta Region.
9000$= mission costs in Haiti that include food, transportation and accommodation for the university students from Port-au-Prince, equipment for soccer tournament, educational supplies and food for Chemistry and Biology training sessions in Limbe, tree planting initiative in Mirebalais.
And don’t forget the awesome rewards on your right that you will get for your dollars! Other ways you can help:

<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Our Model</h3>
<p>Unlike a traditional loan, where graduates are expected to repay the full amount plus interest, we ask graduates to repay a fixed percentage of their income for a set number of years.</p>
<p>This income-based repayment model has two advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">It is better guarded against inflation than a traditional loan.</b><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> In developing countries, uncertainty about inflation leads to very high interest rates on traditional loans. Furthermore, students from disadvantaged backgrounds are often ineligible for loans due to a lack of collateral.</span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>It lowers the risk for students, ensuring that they never end up with debt they can't repay.</b> Our model includes a minimum payment level, so if a student cannot find well-paying work, he or she is not expected to repay.</span></li>
</ol>

<p><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">What about Scholarships?</b><br/></p>
<p>Scholarships are another vehicle for supporting talented students through university. However, scholarships are generally limited to a few students. With our model, money used to support students grows over time, so we can support increasing numbers of students through university. In twenty years time, the $20,000 from this campaign will be worth over $100,000 in student support! </p>

<h3>FAQs</h3>
<div><ul>
<li>
<b>Is 30% a lot? </b>Graduate incomes are 3x-5x higher with a degree. A fixed repayment percentage of 30% means students repay for a relatively short period of time. A student who receives support over their full 4-year degree will be debt-free within 6 years; a student who receives support for 2 years will be debt free within 3 years.  This includes a national service period where students are not expected to repay.</li>
<li>
<b>What if a student defaults on their repayments? </b>We believe that building relationships is one of the best ways to prevent students from defaulting on repayments. Over the course of their degrees, Brighter Students will get to know one another, and will be in regular contact with a mentor through our program. Because some things are outside of our control, we have also included a default risk estimate in our financial models.</li>
<li>
<b>What if a student doesn't find a job?</b> Students are not required to repay until they find a job with salary above a minimum payment threshold. We provide career support to students, and are building a network of employers in Ghana.</li>
<li>
<b>How do you select students? </b>Students are asked to provide standardized test scores and a teacher recommendation as part of their application. Research has shown that a teacher recommendation is one of the best indicators of student success.</li>
<li>
<b>Do you support all degree programs?  </b>We have researched the earning potential of various degrees in Ghana. As we launch the program, we are focusing on students with high earning potential - primarily Science, Engineering, and post-graduate degree programs. Over time, we hope we can expand our list of supported degrees.</li>
<li>
<b>What type of mentorship will students receive?</b> Students will be in regular phone contact with a Ghanaian student mentor, who will serve as a friend, guide, and support.  Once/semester they will meet this mentor in person.</li>
<li>
<b>Are you active at particular universities Ghana? </b>We have partnerships with three reputable universities in Ghana: University of Ghana (UG), Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), and University of Mines and Technology (UMaT).  We will expand to more universities in years to come.</li>
<li>
<b>Why Ghana? </b>We are launching our program in Ghana because of good employment opportunities, a stable government and limited corruption. At the same time, fewer than 5% of young people in Ghana attend university. We believe our model would work well in other countries (such as India, South Africa, and Indonesia) and we hope to expand to other countries once we have established our program in Ghana.</li>

Some of the institutions we will be working with are Thistle Farms, in Nashville, TN, Berea College Entrepreneurship for the Public Good, in Berea, KY, Clearfork Community Institute, in Eagan, TN, and Highlander Center, in New Market, TN. Our efforts will be towards learning what practices from these enterprises are replicable and how we can include them into future innovations of the food system. By working directly with the communities we can introduce or expand the participatory elements in each organization. What does it mean to be participatory? How can outsiders possibly know the answers to all problems that distress others? There has to be inclusion and knowledge from the affected first hand by issues.  Communities should not only help define, but be a part of the solution. Inclusion and transparency are two areas on which we want out actions to focus. Participatory frameworks are key to helping create the most effective and efficient solutions to the social problems this world is facing. Unfortunately, this field work is not included into tuition of our class. Each student has to pay out of pocket to travel. Our flights, accommodations, interstate ground transportation, and meals are all part of the expenses that each student must cover. We are trying to significantly reduce the cost per student for this unique learning experience, so no one students feels they cannot attend due to financial restrictions. Your donation will help us gain valuable hands-on experience in the social enterprise sector, while directly supporting enterprise-based solutions that can be replicated globally in the food value chain.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>For many, a college education represents the opportunity to enhance your quality of life and build a secure future. But with rising college costs, students are forced to take out huge loans to finance their education. Then once graduation comes, students are saddled with huge debts that can prevent them from actualizing their dreams.</p>

<p>Here’s the problem: Since 1978, the cost of a college degree has increase by more than 1,120%. Due to such massive inflation, the average cost of tuition at a public, 4 year college in 2014 is nearly $90,000! But the average family income is only about $50,000. This financial gap then forces students &amp; their families take to out loans to finance their education.</p>

<p>The issue of student debt is too large for just one organization to handle and even if we raised 1.2 trillion dollars, it would only help mollify the student loan problem, not solve it.

<h3>Hi Everyone!</h3>
<p>I have been living in California studying, practicting, and making herbal medicine for the past three years. I currently work at an amazing herbal shop called Rosemary's Garden, opened in 1974 by the famous herbalist Rosemary Gladstar.</p>
<p>Working at the herbal shop has really shown me that many health problems arise first from poor/unbalanced emotional states, for example; stress, anxiety, the loss of a loved one, relationships, poor self esteem, etc.  These emotional states can become very intense and settle in the body in the form of illness. So in steps Flower Essences!</p>
<p>Flower essences heal us on the spiritual and emotional level because many of our physical ailments stem from deep emotional trauma or abuse that gets stuck and can form blockages, physically and emotionally in the body. Certain flower essences, taken consistently over time, will release these energetic/physical blockages, allowing true healing and optimal health to take place! My goal is to successfully treat those going through intense physical and emotional health problems,using this gentle healing system of vibrational medicine.</p>
<p> I want to be the best healthcare practioner I can be, but I need your help!</p>
<p>**The money you donate will go directly to pay for the rest of my class and airfare! My last paymentof $800 is due June 1st (out of $1,900) and I'm just not quite there!  My airfare will be an extra $400. Im working as hard as I can, and as often as I can, but still need some help.**</p>
<p>There are some great perks if you donate too!  Everyone will get a hand-written thank you, and many will recieve a flower essence that I will have made in Alaska! It doesn't get any more pristine and pure than that! Herbal teas, salves, and lip balms will be gifted too!</p>
<p>This program will teach me how to better consult one on one with patients, how to better choose the appropriate formulas for them, and how to make the best medicine that I can.  By helping me, I will be able to help others! :)</p>
<p>I set up flexible funding so if I don't reach my goal, the money you donated will still get put directly towards my class. So thank you thank you thank you thank you! I really appreciate your love and support.</p>

<p> </p></div>","Hi Everyone!
I have been living in California studying, practicting, and making herbal medicine for the past three years. I currently work at an amazing herbal shop called Rosemary's Garden, opened in 1974 by the famous herbalist Rosemary Gladstar.
Working at the herbal shop has really shown me that many health problems arise first from poor/unbalanced emotional states, for example; stress, anxiety, the loss of a loved one, relationships, poor self esteem, etc.  These emotional states can become very intense and settle in the body in the form of illness. So in steps Flower Essences!
Flower essences heal us on the spiritual and emotional level because many of our physical ailments stem from deep emotional trauma or abuse that gets stuck and can form blockages, physically and emotionally in the body. Certain flower essences, taken consistently over time, will release these energetic/physical blockages, allowing true healing and optimal health to take place! My goal is to successfully treat those going through intense physical and emotional health problems,using this gentle healing system of vibrational medicine.
 I want to be the best healthcare practioner I can be, but I need your help!
**The money you donate will go directly to pay for the rest of my class and airfare! My last paymentof $800 is due June 1st (out of $1,900) and I'm just not quite there!  My airfare will be an extra $400. Im working as hard as I can, and as often as I can, but still need some help.**
There are some great perks if you donate too!  Everyone will get a hand-written thank you, and many will recieve a flower essence that I will have made in Alaska! It doesn't get any more pristine and pure than that! Herbal teas, salves, and lip balms will be gifted too!
This program will teach me how to better consult one on one with patients, how to better choose the appropriate formulas for them, and how to make the best medicine that I can.  By helping me, I will be able to help others! :)
I set up flexible funding so if I don't reach my goal, the money you donated will still get put directly towards my class. So thank you thank you thank you thank you! I really appreciate your love and support.


Please share if you feel so inclined, and thank you so so much  all my love xoxo

<p dir=""ltr"">Over a year ago, a small band of devoted Occupiers came together and created the “St. Francis Working Group” to plan well ahead about evolving our current Office and to prepare for the time if we do decide to move to another location. <span id=""more-5362""></span>Now, with numerous General Assembly and Spokes Council approvals, as well as input from <a href=""https://sites.google.com/a/occupyportland.org/opdxinformation/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Info Team</a> and <a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/friendsofoccupyportland/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">FoOP</a>, we have reached consensus that we will move to a more efficient and affordable location, but we need YOU to help make that happen.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">There are several reasons why this consensus has been reached. Accessibility has always been an issue at St. Francis Parish, as anyone coming into our office can attest. At the current location there is no parking nor a direct entryway, and with none of the windows facing the adjacent street, it is tucked away and easy to pass by. We wanted to downsize so we can begin allocating our funds to events and social projects again and focus less on Rent. Moving to a new location is really an expansion of our movement by making the office more accessible, giving it better exposure and making it more efficient.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Your donations will be used to provide us with the first month, the last month and the security deposit organizations must submit up-front when renting any unit. It will provide us a safety net so we can more quickly allocate our funds to event and social projects.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">If you don't have any money, you can still help us out!!

<p>Hello, my name is Amy.  My good friend, Robert Fleming, started the Malayaka House orphanage in Uganda, in 2005.  It was very much by chance; he was visiting on a service trip when he encountered a pregnant woman who was mentally ill and living alone on the street.  She didn't even realize she was pregnant.  When she went into labor, Robert took her to the hospital, where she delivered - and abandoned - the baby.  Fast forward 8 years later, to today, and Malayaka House cares for 37 orphaned and abandoned children.  Education is of the utmost importance in Uganda, and all of the children are enrolled in a wonderful school.  However, transporting such a large number of kids to and from school every day is very difficult, and as more children become school-age, it is going to become impossible without a second van.  Robert asked me if I could help by setting up a fundraiser for this project, and I immediately said yes.  But I definitely need some help, and I am hoping that crowdfunding through Indiegogo works out!  Thank you for your support and for reading the story of Malayaka House :)</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>The funding is strictly for the purchase of a 2nd van.  The van will cost more than the $12,000 we are asking for, but we have some outside funding as well, to take care of the difference.  This van will allow all of the children to be taken to and from school with ease, and (most importantly) safely.  If we don't raise the entire $12,000 through Indiegogo, the funds that we DO raise will still go to the purchase of a van.  We will just continue to raise money until our goal is reached. </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>These children have been shown that although there is pain and suffering in the world, people can be very good.  They have learned to trust again, and they have learned to feel loved and to give love.  Malayaka House is a truly amazing place.  We believe, very strongly, that what has been done for these children, they will do for others.  Places like Uganda need Ugandan citizens who wish to make their country a better place - people who grow up, get an education, get higher education and vocational training, and then spread their knowledge to other Ugandans.  The more knowledge and education in Uganda, the less hunger, poverty and suffering.  The children of Malayaka House will be ambassadors for their country, both within Uganda and abroad.  Malayaka House does not seek to ""adopt  out"" their children.  They raise and care for their children the way you would care for your own.  Saving for higher education and vocational training, and paying current school fees for primary and secondary school is a top priority, and it is an expensive one.  Therefore, things that seem ""less important"" like reliable transportation, often take a back seat (no pun intended) to food, education, and health care.  However, that doesn't mean that safe transportation isn't extremely important.  That is why we are asking for your help. </p>
<p>Helping build stronger communities in Africa helps more than just Africa.  Our children, here in the US, are growing up in a global economy.  They are no longer living under the perception that life on this planet is what they wake up and see every day.  The pain and suffering is real...they see it...and they want it to change.  Our youth are ready to make a difference, and we can help them have less of an uphill battle by providing working examples of how to make an impact in a targeted, focused way.  Through education and knowledge, the youth in places like Uganda will begin to whittle away at the corruption that is so prevalent.  We need to work together to make this a reality.  Malayaka House does more than just help itself.  Through outreach programs, they are teaching other organizations within Uganda how to adopt similar sustainability practices, such as solar panels, biogas, rain-water collection and farming, so that they can provide for themselves in a more reliable, cost effective manner.  Resources that Malayaka House receives for projects, such as this van, help alleviate the time and man/woman power wasted on things such as multiple morning and afternoon trips to school, and allow more time for working on their goal of full sustainability and training other African organizations to do the same. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>1.) Another wonderful way of supporting our cause is to help us get the word out! You can visit our web site at <a href=""http://www.malayakahouse.com,"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.malayakahouse.com,</a> volunteer at Malayaka House (Uganda is a friendly, welcoming, beautiful country, and volunteering is an experience that will change you forever), or donate to this project.  </p>
<p>2.) We have partnered with The Groove Tea Project on<strong> Bobo's Coffee! </strong> This delicious, whole bean Ugandan coffee is roasted in small batches in the US, and 100% of the profits from Bobo's go directly to Malayaka House!  You can purchase today by going to this link - <a href=""http://www.groovetea.com/store/adult-tea"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.groovetea.com/store/adult-tea</a> and scroll down to the bottom of the page, where you'll find <strong>Bobo's Coffee!</strong>  Bobo's was named after one very special little boy at Malayaka House.  </p>

These children have been shown that although there is pain and suffering in the world, people can be very good.  They have learned to trust again, and they have learned to feel loved and to give love.  Malayaka House is a truly amazing place.  We believe, very strongly, that what has been done for these children, they will do for others.  Places like Uganda need Ugandan citizens who wish to make their country a better place - people who grow up, get an education, get higher education and vocational training, and then spread their knowledge to other Ugandans.  The more knowledge and education in Uganda, the less hunger, poverty and suffering.  The children of Malayaka House will be ambassadors for their country, both within Uganda and abroad.  Malayaka House does not seek to ""adopt  out"" their children.  They raise and care for their children the way you would care for your own.  Saving for higher education and vocational training, and paying current school fees for primary and secondary school is a top priority, and it is an expensive one.  Therefore, things that seem ""less important"" like reliable transportation, often take a back seat (no pun intended) to food, education, and health care.  However, that doesn't mean that safe transportation isn't extremely important.  That is why we are asking for your help. 
Helping build stronger communities in Africa helps more than just Africa.  Our children, here in the US, are growing up in a global economy.  They are no longer living under the perception that life on this planet is what they wake up and see every day.  The pain and suffering is real...they see it...and they want it to change.  Our youth are ready to make a difference, and we can help them have less of an uphill battle by providing working examples of how to make an impact in a targeted, focused way.  Through education and knowledge, the youth in places like Uganda will begin to whittle away at the corruption that is so prevalent.  We need to work together to make this a reality.  Malayaka House does more than just help itself.  Through outreach programs, they are teaching other organizations within Uganda how to adopt similar sustainability practices, such as solar panels, biogas, rain-water collection and farming, so that they can provide for themselves in a more reliable, cost effective manner.  Resources that Malayaka House receives for projects, such as this van, help alleviate the time and man/woman power wasted on things such as multiple morning and afternoon trips to school, and allow more time for working on their goal of full sustainability and training other African organizations to do the same. 


Other Ways You Can Help
1.) Another wonderful way of supporting our cause is to help us get the word out! You can visit our web site at www.malayakahouse.com, volunteer at Malayaka House (Uganda is a friendly, welcoming, beautiful country, and volunteering is an experience that will change you forever), or donate to this project.  
2.) We have partnered with The Groove Tea Project on Bobo's Coffee!  This delicious, whole bean Ugandan coffee is roasted in small batches in the US, and 100% of the profits from Bobo's go directly to Malayaka House!  You can purchase today by going to this link - www.groovetea.com/store/adult-tea and scroll down to the bottom of the page, where you'll find Bobo's Coffee!  Bobo's was named after one very special little boy at Malayaka House.

In 2012, we will celebrate five years since our launch. The idea came about during the 2006 World Cup from a friend of mine, Leigh Porter, who had worked for Sue Ryder but at the time was working for Peterborough United. The idea grew and grew from that day and we launched with a fundraising gig and what is now our annual five-a-side tournament in May 2007.</p>
<p>After much paperwork and red tape we became a registered charity in October that year, after having our first Kicks, as we call them, in August at the pre-season friendly between Posh and Manchester United. Free Kicks is run by myself and my friend Sam around our full time <a href=""http://www.freekicksfoundation.org/about/"" id=""_GPLITA_0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by CouponDropDown"">jobs</a> and family commitments. I run the fundraising and administration side, while Sam organises all the Kicks, liaising with hospitals, families and clubs.</p>
<p>Since we started, we have taken nearly 140 deserving children and young adults to matches all over the country. The majority of children we give Kicks to go along to the matches as mascots. This generally involves a tour of the ground, a new kit, visiting the players in the dressing rooms, a kickabout on the pitch and, of course, leading the team out ahead of <a href=""http://www.freekicksfoundation.org/about/"" id=""_GPLITA_1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by CouponDropDown"">kickoff</a>.</p>
<p>Most of our Kicks are at Peterborough United matches as this is our team. We do many Kicks at London Road but also at away games, where we treat local children to the experience. Locally the children are nominated by either Peterborough City Hospital, Addenbrookes Hospital in Cambridge or the East Anglian Children’s Hospice, also in Cambridge. For Posh away games we contact local hospitals, hospices or charities and ask them to nominate a fan of the home team for the treat. We also have some Kicks at matches away from Posh, recently at Tottenham, Watford and our first Scottish kick at Glasgow Rangers.</p>
<p>Posh have been brilliant to us over the years. We were even one of their official charities for two seasons and our logo featured on the the third choice shirt for some games when they were last in the Championship, which was obviously a very proud moment for us. During that time, four Posh players agreed to be Free Kicks ambassadors – Joe Lewis and George Boyd are still at Posh but despite moving on, Aaron Mclean of Hull City and Gillingham’s Charlie Lee are still <a href=""http://www.freekicksfoundation.org/about/"" id=""_GPLITA_2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by CouponDropDown"">available</a> to help whenever they can.</p>
<p>We fundraise in various ways. We have an annual five-a-side tournament and cricket match, as well as our main fundraiser each year where we like to challenge ourselves and our supporters! We have cycled from Posh to MK Dons, visited all 92 grounds in 92 hours, walked from Posh to Nottingham Forest and this year we walked from Barnet to Wembley Stadium via all other London league grounds, raising over £6,000!</p>
<p>Over the five years we have been running we have raised over £70,000 in total. Next year, amongst other <a href=""http://www.freekicksfoundation.org/about/"" id=""_GPLITA_3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by CouponDropDown"">events</a>, we have a team of ten cycling from Posh to Paris over the course of four days. Since we got involved in using Twitter we have also had generous support from fans of other clubs. One of the most notable gestures came from Millwall fans who last season donated all the profits from the sale of their fanzine, No One Likes Us.</p>
<p>All the people we meet are inspirational in one way or another. The looks on their faces when they get to meet the players or get to go on the tour of the grounds and see behind the scenes makes all the hard work worthwhile.</p>
<p>Adam took part in one of our first Kicks. We managed to arrange for him to watch a game at Stamford Bridge from the players lounge and he also got to meet John Terry, who gave him his shirt and captain’s armband from the game. Sadly later that year, Adam passed away and this is what his mum Rachel wrote for us about Adam’s day and what it meant to him and his family:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Adam had been a fan of Chelsea for a few years before he was diagnosed with cancer. When Free Kicks Foundation offered him a VIP trip to see Chelsea play, he was more than anything overwhelmed, as was I, that he was being given such an amazing treat just for being ill (as he would put it). We watched the game from the players lounge with some of the players’ families and one of the players willingly had his picture taken with Adam, despite Adam not wanting to bother him!</p>
<p>After the game, we were taken behind the scenes downstairs to where the players were and Adam was taken through to meet the players. He was nervous and excited. When he came back he had tears in his eyes and said “Mum, John Terry gave me his shirt and his Premiership captain’s armband”, which he had apparently never given away before. He was just so overwhelmed and happy and for me to see him smiling and excited like that after everything meant so much.</p>
<p>The experience continued when four months later, a few weeks before he died, Adam received a package from Chelsea for his birthday with gifts and a card hand-written from John Terry and Frank Lampard. He couldn’t believe it. He kept saying “Mum, are they real? Are they really from them?” It was an unforgettable, touching experience for Adam and the whole family – the shirt, armband and cards are all in a huge frame on the wall.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We still stay in touch with Rachel, she did a skydive for us and kindly agreed for us to name our annual five-a-side tournament after Adam.</p>
<p>During the rest of the season, we have Kicks taking place at Posh away games at Burnley, Doncaster, Crystal Palace, Ipswich and Derby as well as more at London Road. We are also hoping to go back to one of our favourite clubs, Huddersfield Town, plus we are trying to organise days out at Everton and QPR. Our aim is to eventually have a Kick at every club in the country. When we visited Hull last Saturday, we were exactly halfway through the 92! We would also like to do more in Scotland and maybe even Europe!</p></div>","At Free Kicks Foundation we raise money to give deserving children (and sometimes adults) days out at football.

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Poor foundational skills in English and Maths are among the greatest barriers to future educational and employment opportunities for children living in South African townships.  Education without Borders (EwB) (<a href=""http://www.educationwithoutborders.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.educationwithoutborders.ca</a>) is addressing these barriers by providing a tutoring program that is designed to instill a love of learning among primary and secondary learners. </p>
<h2>Program Goal</h2>
<p>Our goal is to enhance EwB’s tutoring program by fully integrating e-Learning into our academic curriculum at Fezeka Secondary School in Gugulethu township, Cape Town.  Providing e-Learning opportunities for disadvantaged children is empowering, offering them the chance to become excited, focused and driven in their schooling.  We need your help to make this happen!</p>
<h2>E-Learning</h2>

</div></div>","Background
Poor foundational skills in English and Maths are among the greatest barriers to future educational and employment opportunities for children living in South African townships.  Education without Borders (EwB) (www.educationwithoutborders.ca) is addressing these barriers by providing a tutoring program that is designed to instill a love of learning among primary and secondary learners. 
Program Goal
Our goal is to enhance EwB’s tutoring program by fully integrating e-Learning into our academic curriculum at Fezeka Secondary School in Gugulethu township, Cape Town.  Providing e-Learning opportunities for disadvantaged children is empowering, offering them the chance to become excited, focused and driven in their schooling.  We need your help to make this happen!
E-Learning
Education without Borders’ e-Learning program will use the Social Project’s School-in-a-Box (https://schoolinabox.co.za) which provides tablet-based lessons.  The curriculum provided by the tablets you're helping raise money for provides ten in-depth, engaging, and standard-aligned subjects for our learners.
Education without Borders’ primary focus is centered around English and Maths. Half of the subjects provided through the tablets directly align with this focus and give the learners a wide range of material to work with according to their skill level. The other five subjects (Natural Science, Science, Computer Technology, Afrikaans, and Business) will also be used by the learners, but as a secondary focus.
Program Impact
The learners at Fezeka Secondary School are incredibly disadvantaged. For a myriad of reasons, these children simply do not get a quality education, which severely limits the opportunities they have after their schooling is complete. Education is the best way to empower children and give them the chance to succeed and break the mold of their current life. 
Education without Border’s e-Learning program greatly increases the chances of empowering our learners and helping them succeed. Through the material provided on the tablets, supplemented by our already established curriculum, we’re able to bring EwB’s program to a new level of efficacy and modernity to create an environment where our learners are excited and driven to better themselves.
To be ‘job ready’, one needs to be technology literate. EwB learners are at a disadvantage due to lack of opportunities, including access to technology. Simply giving EwB learners the chance to work with, use, manipulate and interact with technology through e-Learning makes future employment success a more attainable goal.
Fundraising Goal
Education without Borders has set $3,500 as our fundraising goal to implement this game-changing, as well as life-changing, opportunity for our learners. Every cent donated towards this program goes straight into the purchase of a complete set of these tablets. The closer we get to our goal, the quicker we will be able to integrate it into the academic programs EwB offers.

Our goal is to give a scholarship in Savannah's name to a deserving Russellville High School student each year that represents the same characteristics as Savannah. Over the 2011-12 school year, RHS students worked a booth at football games, cooked pancakes, sold t-shirts, made bracelets and engaged in other activities to raise money to try to make the Savannah Kaitlyn Hintze Memorial Scholarship Fund a reality (also knows as ""The Sunshine Fund"").

Savannah was honestly indescribable. She was one of those people that always made you feel happy to be around. She was beautiful inside and out and had a smile that would warm anyone's heart. She was generous, humble and literally full of sunshine. She made friends with everyone and had a laugh that was contagious. She was silly and funny and always had something nice to say when she saw you. She was honest, earnest and hard-working. Savannah was always the first to give everything she had - whether that was giving whatever money she had to someone in need or volunteering her time and talents. She came from a very modest means, but never asked for a thing from anyone. Savannah inspired hundreds and her passing devastated and silenced her entire high school, just four weeks before graduation. <br/><br/> Savannah's father, ""J.K."" died when she was only three years old. That loss caused her to see the unique value in every single day. She loved her family and her friends passionately. Investing in people rather than things was her daily goal. Always independent, at the age of three, Savannah insisted on dressing herself, fixing her own hair and painting her nails. However, on the first day of kindergarten she told her mom that she could ""play mom"" and do those things for her since this was such a special day for her (special for mom). Savannah is buried in Salt Lake City next to her father. <br/><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.unboundcaptivesmovie.com/sav/51.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>   <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.unboundcaptivesmovie.com/sav/52.JPG"" src="""" style=""""/></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span>Auf Deutsch (for english text please scroll down)</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Ich habe vor zwei Jahren meinen Digitalisierungsservice <a href=""http://www.Eridian.de"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.Eridian.de</a> gegründet. Für Verlage und Autoren digitalisiere ich schon seit geraumer Zeit Bücher. Nun habe ich einen neuen Kundenkreis für mich entdeckt. Sehbehinderte und Blinde Menschen, die Bücher nicht mehr auf herkömmliche Weise lesen können (siehe hierzu § 45a UrhG). Mit und durch die Unterstützung des ABSV ist mein Service in dieser Zielgruppe mittlerweile recht bekannt.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Nun möchte ich noch einen Schritt weiter gehen und den Sehbehinderten und Blinden eine barrierefreie Internetplattform bauen, auf der Sie untereinander (mit ihren Freunden) digitalisierte Bücher tauschen können. Ich habe sehr konkrete Vorstellung wie dies mit den aktuell bestehenden Gesetzen konform geht.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Erste Rücksprachen mit Rechtsanwälten, die spezielisiert sind auf das Urheberrecht, bestätigen die legale Umsetzung diese Projekts. </span></p>
<p><span>Die meisten Bücher, die wir in unseren Bücherregalen zu stehen haben gibt es nicht in digitaler Form. Sehbehinderte können aufgrund Ihrer Einschränkungen  papiergebundene Bücher nicht mehr lesen und benötigen ein digitales Format, dass es Ihnen erlaubt die Schrift zu zoomen. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Kunden können mithilfe der Internetplattform nun Ihre eingescannten Bücher untereinander tauschen, so dass sie auf einmal auf eine große Bandbreite von Büchern zugreifen können, nicht nur auf die eignen eingescannten Bücher. Die Einschränkungen von Sehbehinderten und Blinden werden somit ein wenig kleiner.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Weitere Möglichkeiten: Webbasierter Player zum direkten vorlesen der Bücher. Durchsuchbare PDF-Dateien lassen sich allein schon mit dem Adobe Acrobat Reader vorlesen. Hier gibt es aber bereits weitaus bessere Software auf dem Markt, die von dieser Zielgruppe bereits genutzt wird (z. B. der Screenreader)</span></p>
<p>Wieviel Kapital wird benötigt und wie werden unsere ersten Schritte aussehen?</p>
<p>Ca. 50.000 € wird für das Gesamtprojekt benötigt. Nach der Erstellung der Seite <a href=""http://www.swapswipe.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.swapswipe.com</a>/beta (Betaphase) soll eine Anschlußfinanzierung folgen.</p>
<p>Funktionsumfang der Seite:</p>
<p>Wichtigster Punkt: Die Internetseite <a href=""http://www.swapswipe.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.swapswipe.com</a> wird in Ihrer funktionsweise barrierefrei aufgebaut (sehbehinderten gerecht).</p>
<p>Jeder Kunde bekommt einen Account. In diesem Account werden seine eingescannten Bücher direkt nach dem Scanprozeß hochgeladen.</p>
<p>Die durchsuchbaren PDF-Dateien werden dem Kunden in verschlüsselter Form, mit Wasserzeichen (Namen des Kunden) und einer Zeitbome online zur Verfügung gestellt. Sofern der Kunde selbst sich das Buch auf den Rechner lädt, kann er dieses 30 Tage lang nutzen/lesen.

Auf Deutsch (for english text please scroll down)
Ich habe vor zwei Jahren meinen Digitalisierungsservice www.Eridian.de gegründet. Für Verlage und Autoren digitalisiere ich schon seit geraumer Zeit Bücher. Nun habe ich einen neuen Kundenkreis für mich entdeckt. Sehbehinderte und Blinde Menschen, die Bücher nicht mehr auf herkömmliche Weise lesen können (siehe hierzu § 45a UrhG). Mit und durch die Unterstützung des ABSV ist mein Service in dieser Zielgruppe mittlerweile recht bekannt.
Nun möchte ich noch einen Schritt weiter gehen und den Sehbehinderten und Blinden eine barrierefreie Internetplattform bauen, auf der Sie untereinander (mit ihren Freunden) digitalisierte Bücher tauschen können. Ich habe sehr konkrete Vorstellung wie dies mit den aktuell bestehenden Gesetzen konform geht.
Erste Rücksprachen mit Rechtsanwälten, die spezielisiert sind auf das Urheberrecht, bestätigen die legale Umsetzung diese Projekts. 
Die meisten Bücher, die wir in unseren Bücherregalen zu stehen haben gibt es nicht in digitaler Form. Sehbehinderte können aufgrund Ihrer Einschränkungen  papiergebundene Bücher nicht mehr lesen und benötigen ein digitales Format, dass es Ihnen erlaubt die Schrift zu zoomen. 
Kunden können mithilfe der Internetplattform nun Ihre eingescannten Bücher untereinander tauschen, so dass sie auf einmal auf eine große Bandbreite von Büchern zugreifen können, nicht nur auf die eignen eingescannten Bücher. Die Einschränkungen von Sehbehinderten und Blinden werden somit ein wenig kleiner.
Weitere Möglichkeiten: Webbasierter Player zum direkten vorlesen der Bücher. Durchsuchbare PDF-Dateien lassen sich allein schon mit dem Adobe Acrobat Reader vorlesen. Hier gibt es aber bereits weitaus bessere Software auf dem Markt, die von dieser Zielgruppe bereits genutzt wird (z. B. der Screenreader)
Wieviel Kapital wird benötigt und wie werden unsere ersten Schritte aussehen?
Ca. 50.000 € wird für das Gesamtprojekt benötigt. Nach der Erstellung der Seite www.swapswipe.com/beta (Betaphase) soll eine Anschlußfinanzierung folgen.
Funktionsumfang der Seite:
Wichtigster Punkt: Die Internetseite www.swapswipe.com wird in Ihrer funktionsweise barrierefrei aufgebaut (sehbehinderten gerecht).
Jeder Kunde bekommt einen Account. In diesem Account werden seine eingescannten Bücher direkt nach dem Scanprozeß hochgeladen.
Die durchsuchbaren PDF-Dateien werden dem Kunden in verschlüsselter Form, mit Wasserzeichen (Namen des Kunden) und einer Zeitbome online zur Verfügung gestellt. Sofern der Kunde selbst sich das Buch auf den Rechner lädt, kann er dieses 30 Tage lang nutzen/lesen. In diesen 21 Tagen wird das Buch online nicht mehr abrufbar sein und kann somit nicht zum Tausch angeboten werden. Nach 21 Tagen erscheint die PDF wieder im Account, da die Zeitbombe die heruntergeladene Datei unbrauchbar macht.
Sofern ein Tausch mit einem Freund zustande kommt, wird die Datei von einem Account in den anderen übertragen, so dass der Verleiher das Leserecht an seinem Buch für 21 Tage abtritt.
Die Seite wird vorraussichtlich gegen ein geringes monatliches Nutzungsentgelt verfügbar sein. Verleiher bekommen sogenannte ""Swaps"" für jeden Tausch (virtuelle Währung), die Sie in Sachwerte eintauschen können.

The platform
Eridian wants to create an easy access to any given book for the blind and the visually impaired. Thereby the quality of life of this group of people can be increased granting them access to education and entertainment.Name of the platform: www.swapswipe.com
You can compare swapswipe.com with the swap opportunity by Amazon and Barnes & Nobles. The diffrence will be that your scanned books uploaded on the platform (by eridian.de) will stay in your property. However, purchased e-books cannot be offered for trade on this platform except if the publishers can be convinced to work with us and an enlargement of the concept is made possible. We want to create a legal, internet based access to books that can be compared to the business models in the music industry (monthly fees pay for an unlimited number of songs).The Website will start for the handicaped people in Germany but I would like you to start scanning books for them in your own country and use swapswipe.com for your customers.

Did you knwo that there are 285 mio. visiually handicapped and blind people worldwide out there?
What do we need? Money to create the internet platform. Money for new employers and maybe new scanner (scanner that do not destroy the books / often asked).
I do not require funds for marketing since these funds are generated by my core business.
First Step
The first Step will be to create the internetplatform. Responsable for this field will be www.bytepark.de. Bytepark has already created the website www.eridian.de. (have a look at their references)
I hope that the work can start in November, so we can see in January first results.

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Hi! I'm an independently published author, and patented game designer, and it's clear to me that you can't compete in the near monopoly dominated situation that the media in this world has become without working with others in a spirit of cooperation and support.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">This is why I created the International Independent Authors and Artists Consortium (<strong>IIAAC</strong>) a couple of years ago. The purpose of the IIAAC is to create an inexpensive avenue of advertising by connecting businesses (large and small) and creators in the real and electronic worlds, and we need help!</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><strong>WHAT IT IS</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">IIAAC is different than other attempts (webrings) because it concentrates on real world forms of advertising. Webrings and collectives draw the attention of abusers and money grubbing individuals. They insist that you abide by their advertising standards, many of which prohibit you from networked advertising, or are so disorganized and unmonitored that you don't know what you're clicking on.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">So for the last two years I've been trying to work with others (from music and movies, to sculptures and books) in order to develop an advertising scheme that is low cost for the average individual to compete but still be effective.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">The answer we came up with was a catalog system designed to be shown wherever a member makes an appearance. I have to say for a trial run, with a low quality website and no funds spent in advertising, it has shown a degree of success!</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><strong>HOW IT WORKS</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">As I said above, the basic premise is that members bring copies of the catalog to one of their events. They aren't forced to, but if they do, they gain advertising credit. While showing off their own work, they explain to their audience that they're part of this group which is trying to bring independent creators and supportive businesses into the mainstream. They ask people to check it out, then they go on with their own presentation.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">The concept of the catalog is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Only a handful of copies are printed at one time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Prospective customers are allowed/encouraged to thumb through the catalog and see if there is anything they might like.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">If there is something they like, they could use their smart phone to zap a QR code and make a purchase right then and there for the item in question.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Only certain people visiting the creator should be given a catalog (such as prospective businesses/Big Wigs), the rest are encouraged to take the more inexpensive business card home.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Yes, this catalog concentrates on QR codes, but if a person doesn't have a QR code reader, the downloadable catalog will still have clickable links to the items in question.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">The fee schedule for advertising is based off a scale of individuals, businesses (small and large), and separated into 2 types- horizontal slots, then half and full page advertising.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">As stated before, people can earn credits for advertising by advertising in the catalog or IIAAC itself, on their site and/or at their events (such as conventions, book signings, fairs, etc.)</p>

</ul><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><strong>SUCCESS AND WHY WE NEED SUPPORT</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">In just 4 events, and no advertising budget, we've managed several hundred hits to the main site, and have received personal and public encouragement by prospective customers. I believe this shows that this concept can be a success! The big issue now is start up funding to fully advertise for IIAAC as well as bring more projects to fruition for the benefit of IIAAC and its members. These projects include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><strong>A professionally executed webpage. </strong><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> While we have dozens of members right now, I am the sole person constructing our internet presence.

</li>
<li>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><strong>More than one catalog.</strong><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> Right now the IIAAC catalog is a Direct-To-Purchase catalog, which really doesn't help small business owners. Therefore I would like to create a brick and mortar friendly catalog which would allow shop owners to process orders from their customers, thus receiving a portion of profits of the sales of independent material. Catalogs still cost money to print as well as take efforts to design. That's why more funding will help me handle 2 catalogs at once. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><strong>Serious/steady advertising for IIAAC. </strong><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I make no money off IIAAC.

I want to keep IIAAC inexpensive and void of non-participating corporate advertisements. The only way to do that is via sponsor systems such as Indiegogo.com. Book signings and conventions only do so much. Facebook ads, Yahoo ads, newspaper ads, need to be made a reality. </span></p>

Hi! I'm an independently published author, and patented game designer, and it's clear to me that you can't compete in the near monopoly dominated situation that the media in this world has become without working with others in a spirit of cooperation and support.
 
This is why I created the International Independent Authors and Artists Consortium (IIAAC) a couple of years ago. The purpose of the IIAAC is to create an inexpensive avenue of advertising by connecting businesses (large and small) and creators in the real and electronic worlds, and we need help!
 
WHAT IT IS
IIAAC is different than other attempts (webrings) because it concentrates on real world forms of advertising. Webrings and collectives draw the attention of abusers and money grubbing individuals. They insist that you abide by their advertising standards, many of which prohibit you from networked advertising, or are so disorganized and unmonitored that you don't know what you're clicking on.
 
So for the last two years I've been trying to work with others (from music and movies, to sculptures and books) in order to develop an advertising scheme that is low cost for the average individual to compete but still be effective.
 
The answer we came up with was a catalog system designed to be shown wherever a member makes an appearance. I have to say for a trial run, with a low quality website and no funds spent in advertising, it has shown a degree of success!
 
HOW IT WORKS
As I said above, the basic premise is that members bring copies of the catalog to one of their events. They aren't forced to, but if they do, they gain advertising credit. While showing off their own work, they explain to their audience that they're part of this group which is trying to bring independent creators and supportive businesses into the mainstream. They ask people to check it out, then they go on with their own presentation.
 
The concept of the catalog is as follows:


Only a handful of copies are printed at one time.


Prospective customers are allowed/encouraged to thumb through the catalog and see if there is anything they might like.


If there is something they like, they could use their smart phone to zap a QR code and make a purchase right then and there for the item in question.


Only certain people visiting the creator should be given a catalog (such as prospective businesses/Big Wigs), the rest are encouraged to take the more inexpensive business card home.


Yes, this catalog concentrates on QR codes, but if a person doesn't have a QR code reader, the downloadable catalog will still have clickable links to the items in question.


The fee schedule for advertising is based off a scale of individuals, businesses (small and large), and separated into 2 types- horizontal slots, then half and full page advertising.


As stated before, people can earn credits for advertising by advertising in the catalog or IIAAC itself, on their site and/or at their events (such as conventions, book signings, fairs, etc.)

 
 
SUCCESS AND WHY WE NEED SUPPORT
In just 4 events, and no advertising budget, we've managed several hundred hits to the main site, and have received personal and public encouragement by prospective customers. I believe this shows that this concept can be a success! The big issue now is start up funding to fully advertise for IIAAC as well as bring more projects to fruition for the benefit of IIAAC and its members. These projects include, but are not limited to:


A professionally executed webpage.  While we have dozens of members right now, I am the sole person constructing our internet presence. I want the webpage to look nice, and the only knowledge I have is HTML For Dummies. As a result we need money, or a volunteer, to fashion a professional webpage presence so we can be productive outside of just Facebook.


More than one catalog. Right now the IIAAC catalog is a Direct-To-Purchase catalog, which really doesn't help small business owners. Therefore I would like to create a brick and mortar friendly catalog which would allow shop owners to process orders from their customers, thus receiving a portion of profits of the sales of independent material. Catalogs still cost money to print as well as take efforts to design. That's why more funding will help me handle 2 catalogs at once. 


Serious/steady advertising for IIAAC. I make no money off IIAAC. In fact, I donate quite a bit more than the average person may guess. While I firmly believe in this non-profit style consortium, I need financial backing in order to start with serious advertising. I want to keep IIAAC inexpensive and void of non-participating corporate advertisements. The only way to do that is via sponsor systems such as Indiegogo.com. Book signings and conventions only do so much. Facebook ads, Yahoo ads, newspaper ads, need to be made a reality. 


*Mall Kiosk Consignment Sales. If we go above and beyond $1,000 we wish to eye Kiosk Consignment Presence in a high traffic mall area.

 
By donating to IIAAC, you aren't just helping me, you are helping every single independent artist and supporting business within IIAAC to gain a larger foothold in near monopoly dominated industries. If you care at all about independent projects of all kinds, you will either directly support us with money or help spread the word around.
 
IIAAC cannot, and will not, promise sales and success. No marketing agency or attempt can ever do that while conducting itself in a legal manner. What we can promise is that we will do our best. Success is dependent entirely on people supporting independent creators. That also means creators have to support each other. I will always carry an IIAAC catalog and business cards wherever I go. I will always advertise for my fellow creators and businesses. I will never take money from IIAAC for my own personal means.
 
The advertising spent here for this indiegogo campaign is paid for entirely by those who advertise in the catalog for its first test run. They believe enough in this catalog to try and make it work. 
 
Do you believe in us, do you believe in yourself and in your commitment to support independent creators enough that you will help make IIAAC a success?
 
We're setting our goal at $1,000.00, which will be enough to get a professionally designed website, to guarantee 2 types of catalogs printing at once (brick and mortar, and direct-to-sales QR code), and modest advertising presence.
 
WHAT YOU GET
Rewards for donation are:


For any donation, a special personalized thank-you on the Facebook website (which may mean bonus advertising for your business venture)


For a $50 donation, the public thank-you PLUS John Rocket merchandise totaling no more than $15 in value.


For a $100 donation, the public thank you PLUS John Rocket merchandise totaling no more than $30 in value.


For a $800 donation, the public thank-you PLUS the hand-bound typed facsimile of John Rocket. The hand-typed charity edition of John Rocket is $80 in materials fees, the entire novel was re-typed on a 1935-36 Royal Portable Junior typewriter, the pages were scanned into the computer, corrected for some distortion and errors, then reprinted on fine business paper for the sole purpose of raising money for charity. Normally this goes for $195.30, with $120 guaranteed for charity. But for the purpose of raising money for IIAAC, I will include a charity copy along with contract and owner transference of that specific copy to anyone who donates $800 or more to the IIAAC.

 
If you are not interested in John Rocket or its merchandise, and would prefer a substitute of equal value in participation through IIAAC, we will be happy to oblige!
 
Stay tuned to the rewards section as they may be expanded with alternate offers or rewards for donations above $1000.
 
And as always, we would like to welcome ANY independent creator or business, even if they can't donate to our cause.

WHAT IS JOHN ROCKET?
John Rocket is a superhero I created for the sole purpose of introducing a non-white non-stereotyped hero.  I believe the major comic book publishers have failed the American people by not providing us with non-white heroes who aren't simple cardboard cut outs.  I also believe strongly that John Rocket must be a hero in real life as well as in fiction, hence my charity edition and donations.  To find out more about John Rocket, please visit the following links:

This business was born from a labor of love and teaching sign language has become a true passion that I love to share. My daughter was born with various medical issues and one was the inability to verbalize. There was no one local that could help teach my infant sign language so I went back to school and learned not just how to sign myself but how to teach children. I am now a certified Master Instructor through the Signing Time Academy and offer an array of services to help people learn to sign! I work with children of all ages and abilities! I have gone out on a limb and opened my own office to create a fun, safe place for families to come learn! Every penny I have is going into my classroom and I need help to finish it up AND to help with the expenses of teaching some of my special families. If we reach the $900.00 goal not only will the classroom be complete BUT one more special needs family will be able to enroll!!! Then every $500.00 raised after that (I am hopeful) will secure tuition, classroom materials and supplies for another special needs family! Our largest struggle will be finding funding for these special families that could benefit the most. Please help me help give these children the gift of communication.</div><div>Please share this campaign with as many friends as possible!

 Why this project matters to us, and why we

 As young adults in today's world, we are very
much aware of the global challenges that are around every turn. Often it can be
overwhelming, this constant intake of information that does not usually help us
understand how we can contribute towards possible solutions.
 We are inspired by our participation at The
International Youth Initiative Program, which is a new form of education.
YIP is playing a vital part in the world by providing current knowledge, tools
and skills that move individuals to answer the greater callings of the self and
the world. Alumni and participants (like ourselves) are given the confidence
that allows us to take responsibility and initiative so that we may step into action
for ourselves and for the world.
We are part of a growing collective of young
adults that willingly make themselves aware of the many tasks at hand. We are
creating a future for this up and coming generation to learn to arise to take
on the state of the world today with passion, creativity and commitment.
By releasing this publication we
are actively contributing to this programs future so that
other individuals have the opportunity to embark on this journey.

<h3>Who W.E. Are</h3>
<p>The Warren East High School Band is a rural high school band located in Bowling Green, KY.  We have a successful Symphonic Band, field a competitive Marching Band, and have Indoor Percussion Ensemble, Jazz Band, and Winter Guard programs.</p>
<p>Over the last several years, our program has grown by leaps and bounds, allowing us to provide more and more students with a quality musical education.  Unfortunately, however, our budget has not grown in the same way as our program.  This has caused our excess instrument inventory to become depleted, and repair needs to mount.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to continue to grow our program, and to provide the students we have with the highest quality music education possible, we are in need of many new instruments and repairs to many of the instruments that we currently have.</p>
<p>All money that we raise will go strictly toward the repair of our current instruments, and purchase of new instruments.  Right now, our current instrument purchase priorities are:</p>
<ul>
<li>5 Marching Baritones/Euphoniums (approx. $2,000 each)</li>
<li>4 Concert French Horns (approx. $2,000 each)</li>
<li>2 Mellophones (approx. $1,500 each)</li>
</ul>
<p>While we know that the $5,000 we are seeking in funding won't fully fund these needs, it will go a long way!</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">As a thank you for your donation, all contributors will receive the heartfelt thanks from the members of the Warren East Band!  All contributions, great or small, are genuinely appreciated.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact from receiving funding for new instruments will be long-lasting.  These instruments will provide many years of service to our band, and will allow us to offer music education to a greater number of students.  The quality of our program will increase due to the higher quality equipment on which our students will be able to perform.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Anything you can do to help us reach our goals would be greatly beneficial.  Even if you can't help by giving money, you can help the Warren East Band, as well as other bands, in other ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share our campaign with family, friends, and anyone that has any interest in music.</li>
<li>We accept donations of musical instruments.</li>
<li>Attend school band concerts and be involved in the arts in your local schools.  Bands all around the country are suffering major budget cuts and can use any support that you can give.</li>

<p><strong>The world is changing rapidly and no one can predict the future with perfect accuracy. Many of the jobs we recognize today are unlikely to exist in the near future. The path to a successful life is less clear and less determined than it was when we (adults) were in school. Many think there is a strong correlation between what mainstream school systems emphasize and the rise in anxiety, depression, and bullying in our teenagers and younger people.</strong></p>
<p><b>Everyday more youth (and their parents) are realizing mainstream school systems may not be working for them. Many youth feel less engaged at school: maybe they have interests that are not supported in their school; Some youth are under-stimulated and underchallenged, and others quietly fall behind and lose confidence in themselves.</b></p>
<p><b>As a parent, I found myself in this situation with my own son struggling at school and this began my journey to figure out why school wasn’t working for him.</b></p>
<p><strong>When youth are given an opportunity to learn how to think about and analyze a complex situation, they learn to make choices based on the information they gather. Rather than only learning a particular fact or a recipe of steps, they learn how to evaluate information in many different ways to make informed choices and to draw valid conclusions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This process builds their self-efficacy and resilience. It gives them a sense that they can handle the uncertain world in which they live.</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574643395/e70igxxkx6gpp8djhmlm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;color: grey;"">Makerspace where woodworking, electronics, and designs come to life.</p>
<p><b>Arc Academy of Inquiry (""Arc"") is built around teaching youth how to learn in this resilience building way.  Arc is different, because we go beyond the typical research project with a presentation at the end. Instead, we use a progressive inquiry learning model in an open-space environment with educators who model the mindset of lifelong learning. Each student follows a personalized path that is co-constructed alongside their teachers. This takes students through deeper learning activities that grow and expand their passion about a topic or area of interest.</b></p>
<p><strong>In an environment that quietly hums with activity and collaboration, students nurture real friendships, learn to advocate for themselves, and feel more certain about their future.</strong></p>
<p>When we hear stories about bullying, stress, anxiety, and depression, some of it is due to an educational system where every student progresses in lock-step with every other student. Those who want to learn more are held back and get bored, while others struggle to keep synchronized with the class and fall behind. The system is not set up for personalized learning and the structure may alienate students leaving them with no opportunity to grow and shine.</p>

<p>Arc’s way of learning, which mobilizes young people’s interest and curiosity, can build resilience and self-efficacy, which helps teens handle emotional distress. Our students meet and often exceed the requirements of the BC Curriculum too. Our formative assessments and the stories we hear from learners (and parents) tell of transformative experiences.</p>
<p>We’ve bootstrapped Year One of the school and kept our expenses low. We spent what we could to ensure the space facilitates learning and minimizes anxiety. We’ve torn down walls and opened up doorways to allow for an open space environment. We’ve invested in Programs that leverage specialty skill sets: Makerspace, Art &amp; Game Therapy, Math Labs, Exploration Days, French Cafe, and others.</p>

<p>By supporting this campaign, you will join a community of people who are concerned that youth need a different education than what we were offered growing up. You will join a community who want to see more education options made available to families. The people who have supported Arc want to give this opportunity to their own children, their grandchildren, and to other people's children.</p>
<p>By showing the success of this model, other schools may adopt this true inquiry model and we can share the benefits with even more youth.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your support means we can enhance and develop our unique inquiry model to offer placements to more students next year.</li>
<li>Your support means we can cover costs for our weekly outdoor Exploration Days.</li>
<li>Your support means we can increase the hours for specialty staff (Educational Assistants), so they can meet the needs of the Programs.</li>
<li>Your support means we can complete a necessary renovation to our Orange Wall so the open-space environment is engineered sufficiently and earthquake prepared.</li>
<li>Your support means we can have supplies and equipment to support our students' big ideas and innovative projects.</li>

<p>Arc students have explored many topics and ideas. Many have learned subject matter above grade level and many go deeper with their knowledge at their grade level. When they are intrinsically motivated and allowed to follow their natural inquisitiveness, they are open to being exposed to knowledge outside of the BC Curriculum; they regularly consume higher-than-grade-level information.</p>

<h3>Exploration Days</h3>
<p>Learning can happen outside the four walls of a school too. Our outdoor Exploration Days are more than simple walks around the park. There is learning (and math) in everything we do. Students are prepared with guided inquiries and their own questions prior to exploring a nature sanctuary, salmon spawning area, park, beach, or forest.</p>

<h3>Inquiry Time</h3>
<p>Teachers are kept on their toes daily trying to keep up with the ideas and questions. When students are given permission, their natural ability to be curious and explore turns on. This inquiry time opens the door for going deeper with a topic beyond the standard ""2-week project.""</p>
<p>Student Quests begin with questions and provocations. To give you a sense of the variety, the following are from students or guided inquiries from teachers:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How much plastics will we find on the beach? What zone of Willows Beach had more plastics and why?</p></li>
<li><p>If photography is the art of observation, what different views will the class have from the same park?</p></li>
<li><p>Can I make a kitchen knife out of a metal bolt?</p></li>
<li><p>How can I code a video game in first person view? How can I build a 3D character? Can I learn and use Unity?</p></li>
<li><p>How can a blacksmith make a plate? How did a blacksmith make swords in medieval days?</p></li>
<li><p>Can I make my own t-shirts and spirit wear for the school? How do I silk screen a t-shirt?</p></li>
<li><p>What's the best way to make a website to sell my carved spoons? Is WordPress the easiest for me?</p></li>
<li><p>What kind of Rube Goldberg machine can I make? How high does it need to start?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>From these provocations, students follow a 7-step model to go deeper into questions and research and then into planning and actions. The following two lists represent the questions emerging from many explorations.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574742596/e2ertqrmt0jmgqllrdjt.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>The inquiry model is based on robust research in education and psychology. It has been actively used for six years at a local high school, Pacific School of Innovation and Inquiry, which was founded by Jeff Hopkins.</p>

<div style=""text-align: center;color: grey;"">Interview with Jeff about why middle school is the best time in your life for inquiry learning.</div>
<p> </p>
<p>At our middle school, there are no rows of chairs, no hourly bells, and no test scores and worksheets. The focus of teachers is specifically on the learning process, not just the learning outcomes. Learners go on cognitive Quests to inquire about ideas and interests, often on topics not available in traditional schools. Questions are co-constructed with learner and teacher, which is the beginning of going deeper into any topic.</p>
</div><p>This model is interdisciplinary, as well. Quests don't have to be within the silo of a subject. Often Quests cross multiple subjects from math, history, and science to writing and design. Quests follow a 7-step model to allow learning to go deeper in knowledge and give time for reflection. Many of the steps are co-constructed with a student sitting alongside a teacher.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574762126/zhsl4ueknk54xoytemni.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;color:grey;"">Arc Academy 7-Step Model</p><p><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574640582/jyo56hqof01qx3ptfumx.png"" src=""""/></p><p><i>“Your dedication and vision are enabling a better place and way for kids to grow into a healthy relationship with learning.

Sometimes I wonder how I did it.</i></p><p><i>In these moments, I felt a lot of uncertainty. I kept asking myself questions like, ""what do I do next"" and ""how do I keep it going""? Maybe you know what I mean. Maybe you've felt that way when you were trying to do something hard too. What helped get you through those tough times?</i></p><p><i>One thing I have learned through this challenging process is that I need to put myself in a position where I'm able to recognize and celebrate my accomplishments (no matter how small!), and feel gratitude for the help I've been given along the way. To do this, I had to invite people into that tender and vulnerable space where my vision and hopes were held.</i></p><p><i>I knew I had to share my dreams and fears. Luckily, I had 8 dedicated, forward-thinking educators, psychologists, and business leaders step up and volunteer to help me design the school. This amazing team of people helped me cut through the junk that wasn't helpful in school and keep only the pieces that we knew were necessary to help kids thrive. Then we needed to share our challenges and fears with a 10-person Getting Started team to raise enough money to open the doors.</i></p><p><i>Uncertainty and fear cause all sorts of havoc in our minds, don't they? All those thoughts of ""this will always be bad"" and ""I don't have the capability"". I have them. We all have them.</i></p><p><i>So, the most important lesson I've learned through this challenging and humbling process is that I have to invite people into my vulnerable places. When we do this, we do it knowing that not everyone will enter the space with us, but there will be those who do share in the direction we are going.</i></p><p><i>The seed for needing a different kind of school was planted when I saw my son ""surviving"" school, not thriving. In kindergarten, he struggled being told to sit and draw for 20 minutes and was separated from the group when he didn't comply. It broke my heart to see him punished for being himself.</i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1575324367/lwy6cqn7vlz2fiqfui42.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;color:grey;""><i>Separated from the group in kindergarten when he wouldn't comply.</i></p><p><i>Then we moved him to a Montessori school.

Many of the jobs we recognize today are unlikely to exist in the near future. The path to a successful life is less clear and less determined than it was when we (adults) were in school. Many think there is a strong correlation between what mainstream school systems emphasize and the rise in anxiety, depression, and bullying in our teenagers and younger people.
Everyday more youth (and their parents) are realizing mainstream school systems may not be working for them. Many youth feel less engaged at school: maybe they have interests that are not supported in their school; Some youth are under-stimulated and underchallenged, and others quietly fall behind and lose confidence in themselves.
As a parent, I found myself in this situation with my own son struggling at school and this began my journey to figure out why school wasn’t working for him.
When youth are given an opportunity to learn how to think about and analyze a complex situation, they learn to make choices based on the information they gather. Rather than only learning a particular fact or a recipe of steps, they learn how to evaluate information in many different ways to make informed choices and to draw valid conclusions.
This process builds their self-efficacy and resilience. It gives them a sense that they can handle the uncertain world in which they live. 

Makerspace where woodworking, electronics, and designs come to life.
Arc Academy of Inquiry (""Arc"") is built around teaching youth how to learn in this resilience building way.  Arc is different, because we go beyond the typical research project with a presentation at the end. Instead, we use a progressive inquiry learning model in an open-space environment with educators who model the mindset of lifelong learning. Each student follows a personalized path that is co-constructed alongside their teachers. This takes students through deeper learning activities that grow and expand their passion about a topic or area of interest.
In an environment that quietly hums with activity and collaboration, students nurture real friendships, learn to advocate for themselves, and feel more certain about their future.
When we hear stories about bullying, stress, anxiety, and depression, some of it is due to an educational system where every student progresses in lock-step with every other student. Those who want to learn more are held back and get bored, while others struggle to keep synchronized with the class and fall behind. The system is not set up for personalized learning and the structure may alienate students leaving them with no opportunity to grow and shine.



Arc’s way of learning, which mobilizes young people’s interest and curiosity, can build resilience and self-efficacy, which helps teens handle emotional distress. Our students meet and often exceed the requirements of the BC Curriculum too. Our formative assessments and the stories we hear from learners (and parents) tell of transformative experiences.
We’ve bootstrapped Year One of the school and kept our expenses low. We spent what we could to ensure the space facilitates learning and minimizes anxiety. We’ve torn down walls and opened up doorways to allow for an open space environment. We’ve invested in Programs that leverage specialty skill sets: Makerspace, Art & Game Therapy, Math Labs, Exploration Days, French Cafe, and others.

Collaborating together; learning together.
In fewer than two years, we’ve created something special. Now we need your help to cover equipment, supplies, and programs so we can grow this school into a pillar of the Greater Victoria community.

By supporting this campaign, you will join a community of people who are concerned that youth need a different education than what we were offered growing up. You will join a community who want to see more education options made available to families. The people who have supported Arc want to give this opportunity to their own children, their grandchildren, and to other people's children.
By showing the success of this model, other schools may adopt this true inquiry model and we can share the benefits with even more youth.

Your support means we can enhance and develop our unique inquiry model to offer placements to more students next year.
Your support means we can cover costs for our weekly outdoor Exploration Days.
Your support means we can increase the hours for specialty staff (Educational Assistants), so they can meet the needs of the Programs.
Your support means we can complete a necessary renovation to our Orange Wall so the open-space environment is engineered sufficiently and earthquake prepared.
Your support means we can have supplies and equipment to support our students' big ideas and innovative projects.

Any fundraising we reach beyond the flexible goal will help us reach these goals sooner and allow us to better prepare for more students next year.

With every donation, regardless of the perk you pick, you receive your name being posted on three “Walls Of Gratitude.”

A virtual “Wall Of Gratitude” will be featured on our active Facebook and Instagram accounts.
A dedicated web-page on our website where your name will honorably remain forever.
There will also be a physical wall poster in our school reminding families daily of your generosity.

You’ll also receive a special, mystery thank you from the learners who benefit from your support. Their thank you might take the form of a song, a video, a personalized letter, or handmade object. It'll be up to the learners to be innovative and creative in their thank you. And they have creativity in spades!
Arc made aluminum medallions will be designed and crafted to be wearable and presented with pride. This unique and one-of-a-kind jewelry will be forged within Arc and developed as a learning opportunity for students.
Finally, you’ll receive our everlasting gratitude and the satisfaction of being involved in something special in Victoria's community!
Arc students have explored many topics and ideas. Many have learned subject matter above grade level and many go deeper with their knowledge at their grade level. When they are intrinsically motivated and allowed to follow their natural inquisitiveness, they are open to being exposed to knowledge outside of the BC Curriculum; they regularly consume higher-than-grade-level information.

Gab, student in the gray cap (photo above), graduated grade 8 last year with a comment of, ""now I realize that when I started at Arc I had a fixed mindset. From going here, I have more of a growth mindset and know I can do better."" He has since moved onto grade 9 at the inquiry high school -- Pacific School of Innovation and Inquiry (PSII). We are told by the teachers at Pacific School of Innovation and Inquiry (PSII) that they are always excited to welcome students from Arc, as our students already know how to tap into their creativity and curiosity.

Exploration Days
Learning can happen outside the four walls of a school too. Our outdoor Exploration Days are more than simple walks around the park. There is learning (and math) in everything we do. Students are prepared with guided inquiries and their own questions prior to exploring a nature sanctuary, salmon spawning area, park, beach, or forest.

Inquiry Time
Teachers are kept on their toes daily trying to keep up with the ideas and questions. When students are given permission, their natural ability to be curious and explore turns on. This inquiry time opens the door for going deeper with a topic beyond the standard ""2-week project.""
Student Quests begin with questions and provocations. To give you a sense of the variety, the following are from students or guided inquiries from teachers:

How much plastics will we find on the beach? What zone of Willows Beach had more plastics and why?
If photography is the art of observation, what different views will the class have from the same park?
Can I make a kitchen knife out of a metal bolt?
How can I code a video game in first person view? How can I build a 3D character? Can I learn and use Unity?
How can a blacksmith make a plate? How did a blacksmith make swords in medieval days?
Can I make my own t-shirts and spirit wear for the school? How do I silk screen a t-shirt?
What's the best way to make a website to sell my carved spoons? Is WordPress the easiest for me?
What kind of Rube Goldberg machine can I make? How high does it need to start?

From these provocations, students follow a 7-step model to go deeper into questions and research and then into planning and actions. The following two lists represent the questions emerging from many explorations.

Much happens in a week and students need materials to keep going.
 

The inquiry model is based on robust research in education and psychology. It has been actively used for six years at a local high school, Pacific School of Innovation and Inquiry, which was founded by Jeff Hopkins.

Interview with Jeff about why middle school is the best time in your life for inquiry learning.
 
At our middle school, there are no rows of chairs, no hourly bells, and no test scores and worksheets. The focus of teachers is specifically on the learning process, not just the learning outcomes. Learners go on cognitive Quests to inquire about ideas and interests, often on topics not available in traditional schools. Questions are co-constructed with learner and teacher, which is the beginning of going deeper into any topic.
This model is interdisciplinary, as well. Quests don't have to be within the silo of a subject. Often Quests cross multiple subjects from math, history, and science to writing and design. Quests follow a 7-step model to allow learning to go deeper in knowledge and give time for reflection. Many of the steps are co-constructed with a student sitting alongside a teacher.Arc Academy 7-Step Model“Your dedication and vision are enabling a better place and way for kids to grow into a healthy relationship with learning. Our son loved the trip to Sooke & Foggy Mountain Forge and is really showing signs of starting to embrace the inquiry process in a positive and productive way. The staff is excellent. We’re so glad that this school opened just at the right time for our family and we look forward to supporting it in becoming well-established.” -- Kay, Arc parentStudents prepare learning outcomes prior to Exploration Days.""G used to come home from school saying “Mom, I want to learn more but I’ve run out ofquestions!” He was frustrated with the noise in public school, the necessity for a schedule, and the rapid shifts from one subject to another. He is thriving in Grade 7 at Arc, where he has opportunities to take on a leadership role, to share his expertise, to learn in a variety of different ways, to plan out his own week, and identify his own growth areas. With Arc’s teachers to prompt him and point him in new directions, he is asking questions again. He is learning to use 3D drawing tools to design and build a new house for his pet chickens. He is writing project plans. He is acquiring the math skills he needs to achieve his own objectives. G comes home from school now happy and full of ideas."" -- Janelle, Arc parentMath Labs draw upon student interests. Already motivated, students take on tough subjects.Even prospective families have something to say. It's exciting that our 30-minute tours with prospective families are booked into January 2020 already. We receive positive comments regularly during the tours as parents see how this model can empower their child.There were tough times as this school was brought to life. In the 8 months before Arc was even a school, the BC Ministry was skeptical about introducing a new school, the city's bylaws hindered us from most locations in town, and some people I knew were telling me I shouldn't go ahead with it.  I didn't see much of my friends and family and there were days when I was overwhelmed and frustrated. Sometimes I wonder how I did it.In these moments, I felt a lot of uncertainty. I kept asking myself questions like, ""what do I do next"" and ""how do I keep it going""? Maybe you know what I mean. Maybe you've felt that way when you were trying to do something hard too. What helped get you through those tough times?One thing I have learned through this challenging process is that I need to put myself in a position where I'm able to recognize and celebrate my accomplishments (no matter how small!), and feel gratitude for the help I've been given along the way. To do this, I had to invite people into that tender and vulnerable space where my vision and hopes were held.I knew I had to share my dreams and fears. Luckily, I had 8 dedicated, forward-thinking educators, psychologists, and business leaders step up and volunteer to help me design the school. This amazing team of people helped me cut through the junk that wasn't helpful in school and keep only the pieces that we knew were necessary to help kids thrive. Then we needed to share our challenges and fears with a 10-person Getting Started team to raise enough money to open the doors.Uncertainty and fear cause all sorts of havoc in our minds, don't they? All those thoughts of ""this will always be bad"" and ""I don't have the capability"". I have them. We all have them.So, the most important lesson I've learned through this challenging and humbling process is that I have to invite people into my vulnerable places. When we do this, we do it knowing that not everyone will enter the space with us, but there will be those who do share in the direction we are going.The seed for needing a different kind of school was planted when I saw my son ""surviving"" school, not thriving. In kindergarten, he struggled being told to sit and draw for 20 minutes and was separated from the group when he didn't comply. It broke my heart to see him punished for being himself.Separated from the group in kindergarten when he wouldn't comply.Then we moved him to a Montessori school. While the elementary program did well teaching him the basics, he was challenged with being contained in a classroom all day and then by the physical shoving and pushing on the playground ""when no teachers were around."" For some kids, this can be hard to navigate.I thought to myself on many occasions, ""there has to be a better way for children to spend the first 12 years of their life."" I was fortunate to have connected with Jeff Hopkins, founder of Pacific School of Innovation and Inquiry, and to have co-founded the Rethink Thinking Foundation events for teens. This showed me an education model existed that had components for inclusiveness, student agency over their learning, and environmental conditions to facilitate choice.Since then, I've met many parents and educators who are excited to see Arc be a staple of the community. I want to thank you for taking the time to involve yourself in this endeavour.Thank you kindly,TomThere are other ways to support the learners and school. And perhaps you want to do more.

<p><b>Hi, we're MOVE. What's your name?</b></p>
<p>MOVE San
Antonio does innovative democracy for our generation. We are workin’ hard to
build a great future and empower great new leaders to keep making it
greater. We are swarms of young Texans, doing democracy in a
hands-on way. We put feet on the streets, butts in the seats and votes in the
election…eets. We work to make politics more accessible, more equitable and
more innovative. We know our generation can save the world and we need your
help.</p>
<p>Our leaders are
amazing. They're the people that skip meals, overload
on caffeine, and stay at the office waaaay past five to get the job done. Six
of them - Alex, Bela, Brittany, Daniel, Frank, and Seb - are going through an
intensive twelve-week training program to become even stronger organizers and
leaders. During our sixth week, we want to provide a memorable experience: a
two-day retreat for staff and organizers.</p>
<p><b>#Math and #theMOVEplan</b></p>
<p>To provide two days
and two nights in a badass cabin, we need to raise $800. $650 of that will go
to actually renting a cabin for nine people, and the remaining $150 will go to vegan
burgers, s'mores, and gas reimbursements for a few cars to get out in the
country.</p>
<p>At this
retreat, our staff and organizers will develop as a team: not only will we have
trust falls and a cheesy campfire, but we'll also have some real conversations
about why we do the work that we do. We'll review our summer organizing
program, ask for feedback, and adjust the plans that we've made to better suit
the people that work with us. This will allow us to continue improving our
programs and our relationships (yep, all of the feels).</p>
<p><b>Impact Calculus</b></p>
<p>Our programs
have three core principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Civic engagement – engage voters and
     advocate for policies that make a lasting impact Texas’s political
     landscape.</li>
<li>Leadership development for the
     long-term – we’re at the beginning of a leadership pipeline, exposing
     participants to a network of organizations and relationships to give them
     a running start at careers in politics and the public interest.</li>
<li>Advocacy – build support for, pass,
     and implement policies that move us forward and create real change that
     impacts lives and our state.</li>
</ul><p>You can expect
all of this to be improved on and built even further with our retreat.</p>
<p><b>What can YOU do? Great question.</b></p>
<p>Every little
bit helps, and we're not just saying that. Anything you can give will be put to
good use - even if it's only a few dollars.</p>
<p>And, if you
can't contribute, you can still help us out by sharing this page &amp; giving
us a shout out to your friends. PR ain't free, so we'll appreciate the hell out
of that too.</p></div>","Hi, we're MOVE. What's your name?

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Art ala Cartes mission is to make art accessible to all children and families.  We know the importance of art in childrens lives and would like to offer memberships to low income families as well as non profit partners.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Many of these children do not get to do simple amusement activities with their families.  Birthday parties are out of the question for children in the homeless shelters.  By gifting memberships they have a space to invite their friends on their special day.  Art is also an amazing therapy for kids and providing an outlet for them is an amazing way to express their emotions.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $650 to be able to offer a family membership to the homesless shelter partner.  We also need $100 per low income family that we choose to help.  (If you know someone in the portland area that could benefit please email their story to artalacartepdx@hotmail.com</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please share this on social media sites!!  If you cannot donate funds (though even $1.00 helps) we ask that you drop off recycled goods and art supplies.  Most needed supplies are egg cartons, googly eyes, old puzzles, pom poms, fabric scraps, stickers/labels, small boxes, yogurt containers with lids, macaroni, feathers, kids related magazines, old calendars and greeting cards.</p>

<h3>Guate - Guate - Guatemala! </h3> <p>In May, I got an amazing opportunity to study abroad during Maymester with CU Denver in San Lucas Toliman, Guatemala. We stayed at Pavarotti Education Center and got to work with the students. During our first day there we were taken on a tour of the school and got to walk through the classrooms and library. Being a future teacher the tour made me very emotional, and those aspects stuck out the most to me. The students are in need of books. They have a library that has a small supply.

<p>Guatemala is one of the poorest countries in Latin America. 75% of the population lives below poverty
line, and 58% lives below the extreme poverty line. 60% are illiterate in
indigenous population and 75% are illiterate in rural areas. Families make on
average $4 a day. Indigenous Mayans make up half population and account
for less than a quarter of the income/ consumption. </p>
<p>Two-thirds of the
children are in poverty. The average schooling is 4 years and THREE out of 10
graduate 6th grade. “In 2007, only 63% of boys and 64% of girls enrolled
in Primary school reached the final grade of Primary education,” (UNESCO
Institute for Statistics). 9 out of 10 schools lack books and 1 out
of 10 rural Guatemalan children even get opportunity to attend
school. </p>
<p>Schools are poorly funded, don’t have adequate teaching materials,
lack adequate books, teaching guides, literacy materials and teachers are not
trained properly. Many children cannot stay in school; they have to drop
out to support their families, they cannot afford uniforms, books, supplies,
and transportation. School is free but the fees are too high. </p>
<p>The “Civil
War” has a lot to do with education lacking – Mayans are still excluded from
benefits of the country and still remain targets of racism and exclusion from
land, labor, and education. When your country is being attacked, reading seems
less important.</p>

A little bit about what Breakthrough:
What is Breakthrough?
In 1992, Breakthrough was a simple drop-in shelter for homeless adults on Chicago's northside. 
 
Today, Breakthrough operates two homeless shelters, a youth development program and a client-choice food pantry in East Garfield Park on Chicago’s westside.
 
Each year, the men’s and women’s shelters serve nearly 1,000 homeless adults, provide 24,000 nights of shelter and serve more than 70,000 meals.
 
The youth development program partners with families to surround young people from preschool to high school with role models. Students are exposed to academic enrichment, arts and science programs, and athletic and fitness programs.
 
The client-choice food pantry, meaning guests select food based on their families’ needs, distributes 10,000 bags of groceries to low-income families in the neighborhood, and offers employment training, on-site health care, and addictions counseling to hundreds of homeless individuals each year.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>In this envelope I hold my visa for the Czech Republic! It's official, we're going to Prague!  Let's keep up the good work! </h3>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Scoop</h2>
<p>Hi! I'm Richard Fields and I am a full time graduate student earning my MFA in Film &amp; Electronic Media at American University in Washington, D.C.  I've been accepted to study abroad at the Film and Television Academy of the Performing Arts (FAMU) in Prague, Czech Republic, but I will need YOUR HELP to get there!</p>
<p>
</p><h2><img alt=""Filming/Photographing exteriors in the El Yunque Rainforest, Puerto Rico"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/923282/pictures/full/20130711061822-IMG_0974.JPG?1373548706"" src="""" style="""" title=""El Yunque""/></h2>
<h2>The Experience</h2>
<p>The FAMU study abroad experience is a 1 semester (4 months, 114 day) fully immersive program. I will create a short film using 35mm film while receiving instruction from some of the best faculty in the world.  Early on in the program we will study our craft within the classroom for roughly 8-10 hours a day, with weekend excursions and Czech language courses mixed in along the way.  As the program progresses this classroom time will decrease, only to be replaced by our own short film productions!</p>
<p>Prauge is one of the few cities that has preserved it's history, as FAMU sits within the heart of the Czech Republic with buildings that date back to the 1860s.  While there, I want to share the sites of one of the world's most beautiful cities with you, and also a sneak peek of the film I will be creating.</p>

<h2>The Story</h2>
<p>I've been making films for the past 4 years, but the passion for creativity has been with me my entire life. This passion has been expressed through several avenues, and the common factor has been story telling.  Great stories are the source of our life's greatest lessons, and provide the opportunity to influence us as people.  These days, I find myself with a camera everywhere I go, capturing as much of the world around me to share my expereinces with people like you.  It is this power for change, education, and inspiration that has influenced my decision to dedicate my life and love towards making films. </p>

<h2>The Breakdown</h2>
<p>Your generous donations will contribute to our experience in Prague!</p>
<p>Here's how:</p>
<p>Cost of FAMU Study Abroad: $5,600</p>
<p>Cost of Plane Tickets: $1,302.40 (Cheapest)</p>
<p>Cost Plane Ticket Processing Fee: $35</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Total: $6,937.40</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>Although this does not cover the costs of the semester tuition at American university, but the $7,000 will cover the majority of the costs associated with this study abroad experience, allowing for the fluctuation in airline fees.</p>
<p><strong><br/>But what if you raise more?</strong></p>

Latest Update!

In this envelope I hold my visa for the Czech Republic! It's official, we're going to Prague!  Let's keep up the good work! 
 
The Scoop
Hi! I'm Richard Fields and I am a full time graduate student earning my MFA in Film & Electronic Media at American University in Washington, D.C.  I've been accepted to study abroad at the Film and Television Academy of the Performing Arts (FAMU) in Prague, Czech Republic, but I will need YOUR HELP to get there!


The Experience
The FAMU study abroad experience is a 1 semester (4 months, 114 day) fully immersive program. I will create a short film using 35mm film while receiving instruction from some of the best faculty in the world.  Early on in the program we will study our craft within the classroom for roughly 8-10 hours a day, with weekend excursions and Czech language courses mixed in along the way.  As the program progresses this classroom time will decrease, only to be replaced by our own short film productions!
Prauge is one of the few cities that has preserved it's history, as FAMU sits within the heart of the Czech Republic with buildings that date back to the 1860s.  While there, I want to share the sites of one of the world's most beautiful cities with you, and also a sneak peek of the film I will be creating.
 
The Story
I've been making films for the past 4 years, but the passion for creativity has been with me my entire life. This passion has been expressed through several avenues, and the common factor has been story telling.  Great stories are the source of our life's greatest lessons, and provide the opportunity to influence us as people.  These days, I find myself with a camera everywhere I go, capturing as much of the world around me to share my expereinces with people like you.  It is this power for change, education, and inspiration that has influenced my decision to dedicate my life and love towards making films. 
   
The Breakdown
Your generous donations will contribute to our experience in Prague!
Here's how:
Cost of FAMU Study Abroad: $5,600
Cost of Plane Tickets: $1,302.40 (Cheapest)
Cost Plane Ticket Processing Fee: $35
 
Total: $6,937.40
Although this does not cover the costs of the semester tuition at American university, but the $7,000 will cover the majority of the costs associated with this study abroad experience, allowing for the fluctuation in airline fees.
But what if you raise more?
I'm glad you asked!  Each dollar raised over the goal will go towards enhancing the educational experience. Indiegogo takes 4% of the funding if the goal is reached, 9% if not, so I actually do need to raise over my goal.  Also, you'll be contributing towards my American University tuition and production costs of my upcoming film!

The Ideas
Send me your ideas? What does that even mean?
Well, I'm interested in making this as interactive of a trip as possible.  Something like ""project imagin8ion"" meets a film student.  
Excited yet?  I'd love to hear YOUR input on things you'd like to see in a film, and the best and most original ideas I'd love to discuss with you to incorporate them into my next film.  Yes film credits will be included!  So whatever way you express your creativity, I want you to share it with me, and who knows you might be my next source of inspiration!

Where can the entire family go to experience some form of normalcy, inclusion and socialization? Play-Place for Autistic Children embraces the elements of play, family, and recovery while the majority of autism supports are very rigid, inflexibly structured and deals solely with the affected individual. <br/></p><p>Our unprecedented model combines: play (a child’s natural form of engagement), education (both academic and resource), respite relief, management and direction to assist and support the challenges of autism. In comparison, other facilities that strive to incorporate play within their curriculum at most are only able to achieve the typical school-like sensory room layout with a ball pit, a few therapy swings and colorful mats. Play-Place houses an amusement type schematic design with therapeutic overtones throughout for an exceptional format of fun, friendly, flexible intervention. Additionally, limited and infrequent fun-themed community events and therapeutic programming targeted towards special needs children happen during a short window of operation (2-3 hours) and are oftentimes poorly promoted. Play-Place prides itself in the delightful element of accessibility. Driven by the demand of unpredictability, unique needs and flexibility, we are open 7 days a week, from 9AM-8PM with no age restrictions.</p><h3><b>How is our program unique from other programs for children with autism?</b></h3><p>The individual, family and community impact of Play-Place’s comprehensive programming is monumental. Play-Place’s vision encompasses individual growth for those affected by autism through therapy, education, inclusion, and social support; family fortitude through respite relief, sustainability and renewal – thwarting the 80% divorce rate of marriages affected by autism; and community empowerment including cost alleviation, enhanced education and awareness, health and employability. Play-Place’s model of unique purpose, design and impact embraces the entire family as opposed to solely focusing on the affected individual. It bridges the gap between isolation and inclusion; therapy and the everyday nuances of living with autism; and misunderstanding and being understood. Play-Place’s variety of services and opportunities stand unmatched in the autism community. There are very few parent/support groups and just as few and infrequent community activities that cater to the “family” aspect of autism.</p><h3><b>What is the expected outcome of the program for which we seek support?</b></h3><p>The outcome of this program is to serve as a haven of hope for families affected by autism.  The opportunity to function in a natural environment is concrete, reinforcing, and assists in providing educational relevancy for kids and respite relief for the parents and siblings. Play-Place’s multi-purpose programming of education, therapy and recreation is specifically designed to accommodate special needs families seven days a week for family flexibility, respite comfort and overall convenience offering families simple experiences with life-changing impact. Play-Place adds fulfillment and value to the void of something as simple as the chance to see a movie together — often for the very first time; or receiving that special invitation to a birthday party or sleepover they’re not typically asked to attend. Our bottom line is inclusion, acceptance and support.</p><h3><b>How will we sustain this facility/program beyond current funding?</b></h3><p>The requested funding will give impetus to an unparalleled destination of education, therapy and family support which will not only reinforce individual and family development, but also impact community growth and help shave the nation’s $137 billion per year cost of autism. As outlined below, Play-Place will have a diverse income stream. Based on market research, parent feedback and special education professionals’ input, we have designed a comprehensive model of therapy, social support and sustainability. Play-Place’s low cost, two-tier, monthly fee-based membership will offer an all-inclusive experience of fun, therapy, respite, information, convenience and belonging for the entire family. Our membership revenue will be a key contribution in offsetting operation costs. In addition, one of Play-Place’s principal portals of information, connection, awareness and direct communication will be our advertising solutions platform adjoining autism-related professionals (including dentists, chiropractors, behavior analysts and others) to Play-Place’s exclusive families for invaluable, life-changing connections. Our CBI (Community-Based Instruction) education curriculum (multifaceted lesson plans directed towards local area schools) will be a premier attraction and education/therapeutic source for educators and therapists seeking life skill development and classroom reinforcement through scheduled visits. Play-Place will compliment this programming with CBI extensions (after school life skill and education activities) for children and siblings.</p><p>Our target market will be consumer-based with a focus on families affected by autism and other special needs targeting all ages, all ethnicities, all incomes and all education levels.</p><h3><b>What is the projected opening objective?   </b></h3><p>Play-Place is slated to open its doors August 2014 at which time we anticipate completion of the build-out/renovation process, applicable licensing and program design.</p><h3><b>SO PLEASE HELP US!<br/></b></h3><p>Play-Place for Autistic Children has never tried crowdfunding before and is a no-overhead, family-focused organization. Whether you can spare $3, $30, or $3,000, every amount will get us closer to realizing our vision for families and children affected by autism and other special needs. We welcome your comments and feedback, and if you have any questions please do not hesitate to call us at 586-254-6533. <br/></p><p><a href=""http://autisticplayplace.com/thankyou"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">View the donor acknowledgement list here</a>.<br/></p><p></p></div>","Dear potential funders,Play-Place for Autistic Children humbly requests your partnership to provide a fun-filled,  judgment free haven of hope for families affected by autism.

It bridges the gap between isolation and inclusion; therapy and the everyday nuances of living with autism; and misunderstanding and being understood. Play-Place’s variety of services and opportunities stand unmatched in the autism community. There are very few parent/support groups and just as few and infrequent community activities that cater to the “family” aspect of autism.What is the expected outcome of the program for which we seek support?The outcome of this program is to serve as a haven of hope for families affected by autism.  The opportunity to function in a natural environment is concrete, reinforcing, and assists in providing educational relevancy for kids and respite relief for the parents and siblings. Play-Place’s multi-purpose programming of education, therapy and recreation is specifically designed to accommodate special needs families seven days a week for family flexibility, respite comfort and overall convenience offering families simple experiences with life-changing impact. Play-Place adds fulfillment and value to the void of something as simple as the chance to see a movie together — often for the very first time; or receiving that special invitation to a birthday party or sleepover they’re not typically asked to attend. Our bottom line is inclusion, acceptance and support.How will we sustain this facility/program beyond current funding?The requested funding will give impetus to an unparalleled destination of education, therapy and family support which will not only reinforce individual and family development, but also impact community growth and help shave the nation’s $137 billion per year cost of autism. As outlined below, Play-Place will have a diverse income stream. Based on market research, parent feedback and special education professionals’ input, we have designed a comprehensive model of therapy, social support and sustainability. Play-Place’s low cost, two-tier, monthly fee-based membership will offer an all-inclusive experience of fun, therapy, respite, information, convenience and belonging for the entire family. Our membership revenue will be a key contribution in offsetting operation costs. In addition, one of Play-Place’s principal portals of information, connection, awareness and direct communication will be our advertising solutions platform adjoining autism-related professionals (including dentists, chiropractors, behavior analysts and others) to Play-Place’s exclusive families for invaluable, life-changing connections. Our CBI (Community-Based Instruction) education curriculum (multifaceted lesson plans directed towards local area schools) will be a premier attraction and education/therapeutic source for educators and therapists seeking life skill development and classroom reinforcement through scheduled visits. Play-Place will compliment this programming with CBI extensions (after school life skill and education activities) for children and siblings.Our target market will be consumer-based with a focus on families affected by autism and other special needs targeting all ages, all ethnicities, all incomes and all education levels.What is the projected opening objective?   Play-Place is slated to open its doors August 2014 at which time we anticipate completion of the build-out/renovation process, applicable licensing and program design.SO PLEASE HELP US!Play-Place for Autistic Children has never tried crowdfunding before and is a no-overhead, family-focused organization. Whether you can spare $3, $30, or $3,000, every amount will get us closer to realizing our vision for families and children affected by autism and other special needs.

gentrified. </p>

BACK STORY</b></p>
<p>Since 2001 Brooklyn Young Filmmakers has offered classes
(scriptwriting, becoming a production assistant, and how to organize a low/no
budget film and run a set) and produced careers in film seminars with
professionals from different crafts.  (See
<a href=""http://www.wearebyfc.org/peoples-hollywood-2/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">BYFC Milestones</a>).</p><br/><p></p><p> </p><p></p><br/><p></p><p><br/></p><br/><p></p></div>","NOTE TO ALL WE SUSPENDED THE CAMPAIGN EARLY ON:  Shortly after we launched the fundraising campaign for Brooklyn Young Filmmakers, it became clear that the wonderful storefront business we had moved in with, Huey's Chueys, might not be able to survive this especially harsh and snowy winter.  BYFC can be in the space only if Huey's Chueys is. So we did not promote our campaign as we held our breath as the sisters struggled with whether or not they could afford to continue.The holiday months November and December had been unusually slow and there were many days in January where no customers came in the store, and now there is still February and March to get through.  No one expected this winter.   For many small minority-owned businesses in gentrified communities (meaning high rents) this winter could prove deadly.   It has for Huey's Chueys.  With great sadness and to the disappointment of their loyal customers, Jenny and Denny are closing the store, and something special is being lost from our community.  To understand what businesses like Huey's Chueys mean to the spirit of the community read this:  The Night That Made Me Fall In Love With Fort GreeneBrooklyn Young Filmmakers will be temporarily back to organizing our activities from home offices, while continuing with our community projects at other People's Hollywood locations on Myrtle. We're launching our Skillshare Project with an evening of Skillshares March 21st at the Ingersoll Community Center. Best wishes to us allTrayce, Brooklyn Young Filmmakersp.s. read our campaign text below if you want to know what we are trying to doHELP US CREATE A PEOPLE'S HOLLYWOOD
THAT NURTURES BEGINNERS  
In November, 2013 Brooklyn Young Filmmakers, a
volunteer-run 501(c)(3) non-profit, moved in with Huey's Chueys, a Myrtle
Avenue storefront business in the Fort Greene / Clinton Hill area of Brooklyn.
 Huey's Chueys, a retro sweets shop, was in danger of closing because of
rising rent and a loss of regulars as the neighborhood has rapidly
gentrified. 
Grassroots filmmakers
depend upon an extended community to beg, borrow, and learn from. Brooklyn
Young Filmmakers saw the opportunity being in a storefront could provide to
create a neighborhood cultural hub. The more exposure one has to diverse
lifestyles, human interactions, and avenues of knowledge, the more complete a
person will be and the more inspired their accomplishments.                            Trayce Gardner, BYFC founder and director, and neighborhood resident, found co-conspirators in the twin Jamaican sisters, Jenny and Denny, who run Huey’s Chueys. The sisters had dreamed of evolving their store into a café and cultural outpost that highlights all the diverse cultures in our neighborhood.(Of course while remaining the only ice cream parlor on Myrtle!). THE FEAR
We also shared a joint fear – that what is new
will not be blended successfully with what is old.  Yes, more affluent
residents and businesses are moving into our neighborhood.  But instead of
ignoring or replacing the old, what if creative introductions and
collaborations are promoted?  If you have ever visited Brooklyn and loved

desperately want to succeed.

registered in Nigeria. We are made up of Nigerians who reside within and
 outside Nigeria.

Our objective is to empower the young people in the South East region by
 training them on specific vocational skills, building skill sets and 
harnessing the opportunities and drive that exists within these young 
persons</span></p><p><span><i><b>LEARN
 A TRADE, REDUCE POVERTY AND HUNGER</b></i>.

The Millennium Development Goals are 8 international goals that were 
established following the millennium summit of the United Nations in 
2000, as well as the adoption of the United Nation Millennium 
Declaration. While the MDGs are for all of mankind, they are primarily 
focused on children and the youth, as children and young people are the 
most vulnerable when life’s essentials are unavailable. They are always 
the first victim, physically, psychologically or socially.

Prominent of these goals is the first goal which is to ‘eradicate 
extreme poverty and hunger’, a goal committed to by 23 international 
organisation and 189 countries of which Nigeria is a signatory. 

The 2013 Millennium Development Goal Reports (MDGRs), which is a 
performance appraisal of states’ journey to achieving the set MDGs, is 
mixed. For Nigeria, progress towards achieving ‘Goal 1’in the MDG has 
been below average and hence less satisfactory. Over 70% of the populace
 (8 out of every 10 Nigerians) still live in abject poverty and there is
 still a widening gap between the rich and the poor.

For clarity, the first goal in the UN MDG, eradicating extreme poverty 
and hunger, is subdivided into three targets. Target A, ensures that 
between 1990-2015, the proportion of people living on less than $1.25 a 
day is halved; Target B, ensures that a decent employment for women, men
 and young people is achieved; Target C, ensures that between  
1990-2015, the proportion of people who suffers from hunger is halved. 
This is where our campaign comes into. <br/></span></p><p><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/776642/files/20140809114451-Preg_girls_2.jpg?1407609891"" src="""" style=""""/></p>PLEASE JOIN OUR CAMPAIGN!!!
I invite you to join our in achieving the eradication of extreme poverty
 and hunger in Nigeria, and thereby meeting a key component of the UN

registered in Nigeria. We are made up of Nigerians who reside within and
 outside Nigeria.

Our objective is to empower the young people in the South East region by
 training them on specific vocational skills, building skill sets and 
harnessing the opportunities and drive that exists within these young 
personsLEARN
 A TRADE, REDUCE POVERTY AND HUNGER.

The Millennium Development Goals are 8 international goals that were 
established following the millennium summit of the United Nations in 
2000, as well as the adoption of the United Nation Millennium 
Declaration. While the MDGs are for all of mankind, they are primarily 
focused on children and the youth, as children and young people are the 
most vulnerable when life’s essentials are unavailable. They are always 
the first victim, physically, psychologically or socially.

Prominent of these goals is the first goal which is to ‘eradicate 
extreme poverty and hunger’, a goal committed to by 23 international 
organisation and 189 countries of which Nigeria is a signatory. 

The 2013 Millennium Development Goal Reports (MDGRs), which is a 
performance appraisal of states’ journey to achieving the set MDGs, is 
mixed. For Nigeria, progress towards achieving ‘Goal 1’in the MDG has 
been below average and hence less satisfactory. Over 70% of the populace
 (8 out of every 10 Nigerians) still live in abject poverty and there is
 still a widening gap between the rich and the poor.

For clarity, the first goal in the UN MDG, eradicating extreme poverty 
and hunger, is subdivided into three targets. Target A, ensures that 
between 1990-2015, the proportion of people living on less than $1.25 a 
day is halved; Target B, ensures that a decent employment for women, men
 and young people is achieved; Target C, ensures that between  
1990-2015, the proportion of people who suffers from hunger is halved. 
This is where our campaign comes into. PLEASE JOIN OUR CAMPAIGN!!!
I invite you to join our in achieving the eradication of extreme poverty
 and hunger in Nigeria, and thereby meeting a key component of the UN 
MDG. We believe that this can be achieved and better monitored if focus

Louis and I've owned and operated an ""in-home"" tutoring company called Arithmetic Solutions since January of 2005.  Over the years I have provided affordable Mathematics tutoring to inner-city youth by contracting with School Districts in the Los Angeles area, the largest of which being the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD).  As of August 2013, LAUSD decided to eliminate third-party companies like Arithmetic Solutions from the process of providing much needed free tutoring services to our students in the more impoverished areas of Los Angeles.  Although <i><b>""some""</b></i> students still receive free tutoring on certain school campuses after school, a large number have no tutoring at all.  My goal is to bring another option to these students that is affordable for the parents and highly accessible for the students.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Our Goal and Our Needs</h3> <p>    We have begun the process of building an Online Tutoring Platform on which students can access high quality Mathematics Tutoring in the comforts of their own homes through the use of ""real-time"" audio &amp; video.  Once our online tutoring campaign is launched, we will have the capacity to tutor students in small groups online which cuts travel expenses and related insurance costs which in turn drives the cost for services down for the inner-city parent.  </p>
<p>     The $10,000.00 is needed to complete the process of building out the platform and imbedding it into our existing website.  A portion will be used to mobilize a contingent of individuals to canvas areas in Los Angeles that we have identified as the most adversely affected.  We will inform parents of the fact that they do have another option.  Their child need not fall behind.  Our goal is to target those students who are motivated to address Mathematics &amp; Science, but <i><b>do not</b></i> have access because of their Geographic Location and/or Socio-Economic status. Lastly, a portion will be used to purchase learning materials that reflect the NEW Common Core Standards and integrate these materials into our tutoring program. Ultimately we'd like to provide low-cost mathematics tutoring services to 500 students each school year.</p>
<p>     If we do not reach our goal, all collected funds will still go to the expenditures listed above, but to lesser degrees.</p>

<p>     If you visit the California Department of Education (CDE) website you'll see that Arithmetic Solutions has been an approved Supplemental Educational Services (SES) Provider since 2006.  As result, we have provided FREE mathematics tutoring services to hundreds of students throughout Southern California with a 93.5% success rate in raising the students' scores from their pre-test to their post-test.  The free services were federally funded by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 through the local school districts.  Although many of the smaller school districts in Southern California continue to use these funds to provide free services, LAUSD the 2nd largest school district in the country, decided to redirect these funds away from the 38,000 eligible students who severely need them.  Even though some students did receive free after-school tutoring during the 2013-2014 school year, the vast majority of them received no support services at all.  We have the trained personnel to provide services and we DO continue to provide FREE services to various districts around Los Angeles, but we still feel an obligation to those students who were cut-off last year; this Online Tutoring Platform can help us reach them.</p>

</div>
<div>
<span><span>Throughout their four years of high school these students have faced rigorous academic challenges and have worked incredibly hard, but more than that they have overcome obstacles outside of school. Our students have been challenged, but have yet to be celebrated with a trip for their extensive dedication for the past four years.  Many of these students have attended this school for over 12 years and this trip will be a reward not only for their hard work, but for their success that is ahead of them.  In their 4 years of high school, the class of 2015  has exemplified their incredible academic capabilities while demonstrating compassion and respect towards each other and the Lighthouse community. The trip will be the last time the students enjoy a memory together, serving as a reminder of their high school experience. In addition, we hope this field trip will light an initiative spark for their younger peers to step up as leaders to plan their own trips given that this is the very first time a class attempts to fund a project of this size. </span></span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">  </span><span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span>

The Senior Grad Night will take place in Disneyland down in Southern California on next year in June where we will take all of our 52 seniors. In order for this to become a reality we need YOUR help to help fundraise $10,000!
Where exactly is your money going? We have broken it down here for you!

Each ticket for the Disneyland Grad Nights costs $75/person, which will include all of our 52 seniors plus our 4 amazing chaperones. This will come down to a grand total of $4,200!
Since we are traveling down to Southern California we will be using Peninsula Tours a charter bus company that will come down to $3,500.
Also, we will need to get a hotel for a driver that is taking us down to Disneyland, which will roughly be around $100.
We are going to be extremely hungry traveling down to Disneyland meaning we will need food to feed everyone!
The rest of the money will be used with anything else that miscellaneously comes up along the way.

What are the perks?
Are you ready? If you donate $5 you get awesome Lighthouse stickers, who wouldn’t want some of these? Lets continue if you donate $50, you get handmade buttons from some of our seniors plus some Lighthouse stickers. If you donate $100, you get a handwritten thank you letter from one of our seniors, plus the buttons and stickers! It doesn’t stop there, donate $250 and you get your own printed Lighthouse shirt, thank you letter, stickers, and more buttons. We are moving up, if you donate $500 you get your own plaque made and designed by our seniors using our donated laser cutter. More than that you get a letter, buttons, stickers, and your own shirt.. Last but certainly not least, donate $1000 (AH!) and you receive a personalized thank you video, updates on the trip, plus everything else mentioned above!
THE IMPACT


Throughout their four years of high school these students have faced rigorous academic challenges and have worked incredibly hard, but more than that they have overcome obstacles outside of school. Our students have been challenged, but have yet to be celebrated with a trip for their extensive dedication for the past four years.  Many of these students have attended this school for over 12 years and this trip will be a reward not only for their hard work, but for their success that is ahead of them.  In their 4 years of high school, the class of 2015  has exemplified their incredible academic capabilities while demonstrating compassion and respect towards each other and the Lighthouse community. The trip will be the last time the students enjoy a memory together, serving as a reminder of their high school experience. In addition, we hope this field trip will light an initiative spark for their younger peers to step up as leaders to plan their own trips given that this is the very first time a class attempts to fund a project of this size.

Intense smoke has sent people to hospitals, much of the native forests have burned up, coral reefs have dwindled from post-fire erosion, ranchers have lost quality forage for their cattle. These are just some of the many impacts of wildfire in Hawaii. At its worst, homes and lives can be lost. </p>
<p>As the only 501(c)(3) non-profit in the State of Hawaii focused on wildfire preparedness, protection, and recovery, Hawaii Wildfire Management Organization (HWMO) has made great strides in improving the livelihood of Hawaii's residents and tourists while protecting its sensitive and critical natural resources. </p>
<p>It all starts with education. HWMO has created a K-8 Curriculum  that emphasizes fire safety and the values of practicing stewardship (caring for the ʻaina.) We have also developed the first Hawaii-specific Ready, Set, Go! program to teach families techniques for protecting their home and creating an emergency preparedness plan.</p>
<p>We are a small non-profit with a total of five excellent, passionate staff members with a huge responsibility working on issues that are completely under-addressed in our State and affect critical resources. Your contributions will help us expand the reach of our education programs, the number of program offerings, and the numbers of communities we can support.

</div> <div> <h3>Far-Reaching Impacts</h3> <p>Hawaii's precious landscapes and extraordinarily kind and welcoming people can be appreciated by visitors from all over the world. Hawaii is a destination and a home that is under the direct threat of a changing climate and increasing drought periods, which have consequently exacerbated the wildfire threat. To add fuel to the fire, a boom in the population of the State of Hawaii has meant a huge increase in wildfire ignitions (<b>over 98% of fires today are accidentally or maliciously caused by humans</b>).

<p>HWMO has made great strides in increasing fire safety and preparedness through school presentations, workshops, and booth events. One of our highlight programs is our Waikoloa Dryland Wildfire Safety Park. We created and continue to maintain and use this space as a valuable tool for teaching community members about how they can create defensible space and secure their structures to reduce the wildfire risk of their home. What makes the space unique is that we use primarily <b>native, drought-tolerant</b> plants as a way to defend the home from wildfire. Better yet, the caretakers of this land are kids we bring from local schools and programs who've turned into mind-blowing experts on fire safety, fire ecology, and Hawaii's native plants. </p>

<p>Manapság az életünk jelentős része az online térben zajlik: itt dolgozunk, itt szórakozunk, itt vásárolunk. </p>
<p>Az elmúlt 10 évben egy csomó szolgáltatás helyeződött át a fizikai valóságból az internetre: ha utazni szeretnénk, akkor az okostelefonunkkal Ubert hívunk. Ha nyelvet szeretnénk tanulni, elindítjuk a Duolingo-t. Könyvet Kindle-n olvasunk és Audible-n hallgatunk. Életünk érdekes pillanatait a Periscope-pal közvetítjük, Headspace-szel meditálunk, és Waze-t használunk papírtérkép helyett.</p>
<p>Sok minden alakult át az elmúlt néhány évben. Miért lenne ez alól az oktatás kivétel? </p>
<p><b>Ki vagyok én és mi a célom?</b></p><p>Szombati Orsolya vagyok, a Profonte Management és Sales Akadémia alapítója. 15 éves tréneri-oktatói tapasztalattal a hátam mögött azt tűztem ki célul, hogy megreformáljam a hazai oktatási piacot. Egy olyan profi platformot szeretnék létrehozni a <a href=""http://learnie.hu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Learnie.hu</a> elindításával, ahol online is ugyanolyan öröm és élmény a tanulás, mint a legszuperebb élő tréningen.</p>
<p>Ma már mindenhonnan azt halljuk, hogy <b>""az idő pénz"". </b>Legyünk produktívak, könnyen elérhetőek, mobilisak, tájékozottak, és naprakészek.  <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Ebbe pedig egyre nehezebben fér bele, hogy  az egész napunkat (vagy többet) az iskolapadban vagy a tréningteremben ülve töltsük. Okosabban kell beosztani azt, amiből mindenkinek ugyanannyi van: az időt. Ez tudom, hogy nem mindig könnyű feladat, így néha pont arra jut belőle kevés, amire a legnagyobb szükség van: a tanulásra, a fejlődésre.</span></p>
<p>Trénerként, oktatóként ma is őszintén hiszek abban, hogy a tanulásnak helye van, Sőt! rendkívül fontos helye van az életünkben. Azonban, annak a formának, ahogy a tudás eljut hozzánk, változnia kell. </p>

The answer was thougher than I expected.. No material presents were coming up to my mind, but just a very difficult one. I would like life to be sweeter for me, my family and the people I care about (well the rest of the world, too). Does it exist, can it exist a start-up of happiness? Is there any application for smart phones? Complicated. Pretty complicated.So I thought I could be one of those who starts chains of happiness..WHOWell, there is a girl, Giada, my beautiful goddaughter who is one of the persons for whom I care more in my life. It's a long story of friendship and empathy, which started when she was 7 and I was 17. Giada was born with brain damages which caused a spastic tetraplegia and incapability of speaking, but didn't affect her intelligence and the awareness of her situation. The first time I met her I was just a volunteer, helping her with physiotherapy exercises. 13 years after I am her godmother, her friend and a sort of older sister. That's why I want her to be directly involved in my 30th birthday. I want all my friends to know her smile, helping me to help her in keeping it alive!HOWAll your benevolent contributions are addressed to projects that I know Giada is following or wishes to follow, such as a) courses of facilitated communicationb) private course of philosophyc) whatever else can make her happyCONCLUSIONSThanks for your donation!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Cindy Yeh. I live in Los Angeles and today 7/15/2013, my beloved laptop that I had just bought with my own hard earned money in December was snatched out of my hands as I was working at Tribal Cafe on Temple Street. The man was 17-20, hispanic, short curly hair, wearing a bright orange t-shirt and had walked by me 2 times and stared me down each time. I had thought in my head I should move into the cafe but I thought I was being paranoid/judgemental/ safe on the patio so I didn't. The third time he threw my hands off my laptop and snatched it and just ran.</p>
<p>I will never forget that feeling of my own possesion being ripped out my hands, while in eye contact with this young man, and then screaming. I chased him down Glendale for 15 minutes screaming please stop, and nobody helped me. Nobody stopped him while i chased him even though I passed at least 14 people. When i asked people at a gas station to help me and drive after him not a single person would. I finally couldnt run anymore, all the while saying to myself why can't you run faster. I have filed a police report and told them I can identity the boy but I am not hopeful. </p>
<p>So this is my campaign. I am a video editor and i have my life on the computer and now it is all gone. I am devestated and mostly in shock. I dont really feel like leaving my house anymore and I don't feel safe in Echo Park anymore. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I am about to move to New York after an intensive 4 month process of applying for the 12 month fellowship with the NY MoMA. </p>
<p>I went through intensive interviews and was finally informed 5 days ago. Without a laptop I can't really follow my dreams of doing this work the best I can. </p>
<p>This is my dream job, I have worked my ass off at the MOCA and other institutions to get ready for this position. I've worked for free I have spent hours working at cafes and resturants to make enough money for rent and food so that I could pursue my dreams of being a video editor and working in the art world. The art world is hard industry for a young asian american woman to make it in, lets be honest. how many women of color can i look up to in this industry. not many. I want to make a difference, and make voices heard, and represent my people and gender in that world. </p>
<p>This donation would really help me in my next stage of life. I've worked for everything in my life, and after this far of a journey I hope its not my laptop that stunts my future.</p>

<p>Apart from the cost of the books themselves, there's other costs like shipping, ISBN, food, fulfilling other perks, and props for the photography itself. This compounded with my current debt brings us up to 25,000$. Basically I break even if we reach our goal.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if we EXCEED our goal then things really start to get exciting!

Whatever it is, it would be to tackle student debt.</p>

</div><div><ul></ul></div> <div> <h2>Challenges</h2> <p>Making a cookbook isn't easy, thankfully I've done it before, and I know how to overcome the obstacles faced the first time around. As a designer and a photographer, I don't have to hire external labour to make this project a reality. I just have to stick to my schedule, and shoot on a regular basis. When I made my first cookbook I was also working part-time, studying, and managing marketing / PR for my student association. Not to mention the fact that I was consistently creating content for my YouTube channel. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">With studies and the student association out of the way, time is no longer an issue. </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">I also just finished organizing an industry YouTube conference called ViralCon. The event was a success, but was a lot of work, and this seems like a piece of cake in comparison.</span></p>
<p>As long as I stick to my shooting schedule I'll be fine. Another issue that might arise if a lot of books are sold is the necessity to hire people to help with the campaign. Fortunately, the resulting bulk discount should alleviate those costs in their entirety.</p>

Apart from the cost of the books themselves, there's other costs like shipping, ISBN, food, fulfilling other perks, and props for the photography itself. This compounded with my current debt brings us up to 25,000$. Basically I break even if we reach our goal.
If we don't reach it you still get your cookbooks and perks, but I can probably forget about being debt free for a little while.
On the other hand, if we EXCEED our goal then things really start to get exciting! Not only will the cookbook have more pages/recipes, but the excess funds could be put towards a scholarship, or campus food banks, or to create some good paying student jobs. Whatever it is, it would be to tackle student debt.



The Perks!
This is probably why you're here. Apart from the Bake it Off! cookbook and e-book, there's a ton of different things you can purchase to help the cause! Every perk includes Twitter follows + shoutout (plz include Twitter handle) and most include the e-book. As far as I'm concerned, once you buy a book you should own the e-book too!

(1$) Also Broke: Get a Twitter follow + a funny (maybe) shoutout.
(5$) Digital Cookies: Get exclusive access to 5 Just Eyeball It! cooking videos months before the general public, along with the Bake it Off! mp3 and the Also Broke perk.
(10$) e-Book: Get a PDF version of the book, along with the Digital Cookies perk.
(20$) Thank You: I'll make a personal Thank-You video for you (1-2 minutes long.) You also get the e-Book perk.
(24$) Earlybird Cookbook: You get the book, and because you're proactive it's cheaper! You also get the e-book perk.
(29$) Earlybird Signed Cookbook: You get a signed copy of the book, along with the e-book perk.
(29$) Cookbook: It's the same book but at regular price! Why is colour ink so expensive? Includes e-book perk.
(34$) Signed Cookbook: It's a signed regular price cookbook! Includes e-book.
(40$) Digital Deluxe: Get a 30 minute Skype call with me, along with the e-book.
(50$) Book & T-Shirt: Get a Bake it Off! T-shirt along with a signed book and e-book perk.
(90$) 24X36 Signed Print: Get a huge print of any photo in the book. It'll look great on your walls! Includes e-book perk.
(100$) Name It: Get a recipe in the book named after you. Includes a signed copy of the book and the Digital Deluxe perk.
(250$) Super Dedicated: The book is now dedicated to you. Includes a signed book and the Digital Deluxe perk.
(500$) YOU in a book: Have photos of you prominently displayed in the book. Includes signed book and Digital Deluxe perk. Does not include transportation. (Photos or transportation + accommodations must be supplied)
(1000$) Corporate Sponsor: brand integration! Think about how many people will see these cookbooks!





  Challenges Making a cookbook isn't easy, thankfully I've done it before, and I know how to overcome the obstacles faced the first time around. As a designer and a photographer, I don't have to hire external labour to make this project a reality. I just have to stick to my schedule, and shoot on a regular basis. When I made my first cookbook I was also working part-time, studying, and managing marketing / PR for my student association. Not to mention the fact that I was consistently creating content for my YouTube channel. With studies and the student association out of the way, time is no longer an issue. I also just finished organizing an industry YouTube conference called ViralCon. The event was a success, but was a lot of work, and this seems like a piece of cake in comparison.
As long as I stick to my shooting schedule I'll be fine. Another issue that might arise if a lot of books are sold is the necessity to hire people to help with the campaign. Fortunately, the resulting bulk discount should alleviate those costs in their entirety.

Towards this end, AERO provides information, resources and guidance to families, schools and organizations regarding their educational choices. AERO disseminates information internationally on topics such as: homeschooling, public and private alternative schools, and charter schools.

I will be okay and able to go on my trip. But because of this as my campaign
to raise funds moves forward, I have decided to shift gears and donate to another charity. I thank everyone that donated to Transition House.
For all future contributions made to my trip I will pay
forward and donate to THE PEDIATRIC BRAIN TUMOR FOUNDATION. (http://www.pbtfus.org) PBTF is a nonprofit
organization dedicated to eradicating childhood brain tumors and providing
support to families. This is so important to me and I want to do everything I
can to help kids like me. 
 

I have been selected to travel
as a Student Ambassador with the People to People Student Ambassador program in
June 2012. We will travel to Italy, Sicily and Greece. The mission of this
educational program, founded by President Dwight Eisenhower, is to create and
promote peace across the globe. People to People is the world's most recognized
and respected, life changing, educational travel provider, where the world is
your classroom. I receive school credit for participating.

The trip is costly (program tuition includes all
transportation, accommodations, meals, and educational activities.) and so I had the idea of fundraising for
it and donating a portion of the funds to a charity of my choosing. For every
donation I receive I will in turn â€œpay it forwardâ€ and donate to The Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation. 
By donating to this cause you
are not only helping me to experience a life changing event but you are helping
children and their families effected by a brain tumor.

Every donation big and small gets me closer to my goal. This
donation is tax deductible. Please pass the word....we can do something great
together! Post on your facebook or linked in. Thanks.

<h3><span>Introduction and Background:</span></h3>
<br/><ul><li><p>My name is Scott Forest Pulsipher. I work for a Park and Recreation Center with whom I bring my Kendo Club to one of their local After School Programs. I have been training with swords and other weapons since I was a young boy. I have read and am currently reading over many widely respected philosophy books which I also bring to the Kendo Club.</p></li></ul>
<p>Why is this Campaign Important to Me:</p>
<ul><li><p>The significance of this campaign goes beyond the 'Box' of comprehension. The Significance not only Fills the Empty Box full of worth and a wealth of personal understanding for each student, but it also is not limited to the 'Box' itself; and may later flow forth to become something even greater and more enriching than foreseen. Today I meditated and developed a saying, ""The moment you understand your own present limitations, is the moment you can evaluate methods to evolve past them."" I truly believe that Kendo has brought me to understand more about my Body, my Mind, and my own personal Limitations. I know that I can guide each student individually and the team as a whole to the same understanding. I just need a few things to aid me in making it a reality, not for me, but for these young adults. I want to be the last stepping stone for these students before they themselves get to make the decision to go on and further their education and understanding of the world. I want to give them the Power to Think as an individual and to work as a Team towards common goals. I want to enrich their lives with Confidence and High Moral. I want to infuse their minds to accept nothing Honor to come forth from their own individual actions; and to become leaders and examples of those actions. The reason why this Campaign is important,... is because it will help shape the future through personal growth and understanding of the new generation of young adults ready to join their fellow citizens in a respectful, mutually beneficial and symbiotic manner. As a Contributor, you will assist me in achieving this goal. ^_^</p></li></ul>
<p>What We as a Team Need and What You as a Contributor Get:</p>

<li><p>Purchasing Armor, Training Swords, Craft materials: Cloth (purchased in bolts of cloth, used for creating a Team Bannar [4 season banner], Tenugui - head/sweatbands), Time Capsules, Cubbyhole Container for gear, Reading and Reference materials related to Kendo and Philosophy.</p></li>

<p>Scott Forest Pulsipher</p>
<br/><p>Last week during the “Club Awareness Lunch Event” in the Quad, here at the High school, I recruited approximately 8-10 more students (Almost Doubling my attendance to a total list of 20-22) to the after school program/Kendo Club Sign-In-Sheet. I have put together the above shopping list which, if purchased, will allow me to begin implementing great things for the program. The students will begin training in Kendo without the need of sharing gear and no one will be left out to watch during training sessions. What I bring to this after school program through Kendo is the same premiss found in any other sport:</p>
<br/><ul>
<li><p>Physical Activity:</p></li>
<ul>
<li><p>Standard Beginner Techniques</p></li>
<li><p>Observation Skills</p></li>
<li><p>Through working out, Greater Self Respect and Internal Gratification.</p></li>
</ul>
<li><p>Group / Team Enrichment:</p></li>
<ul>
<li><p>Technique Exchanges</p></li>
<li><p>Tournaments (Down the road in the year)</p></li>
<li><p>Talent Show</p></li>

<li><p>Team Banner (which will Model as a Form of Earning “Badges”)</p></li>
<li><p>Armor Storage Cubby Holes on Wheels (Lockable)</p></li>
<li><p>Time Capsules</p></li>
<li><p>Customised Tenugui (Head/Sweatbands)</p></li>
</ul>
<li><p>Group Discussions on Philosophy Books (ex: Bruce Lee)</p></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>I have seen many methods of “Storage” which will not only keep the items we potentially obtain, secure onsite; but will also render me not having to handle my own personal mother-load of gear to and fro’. (Of course I will still carry certain items unique to my own personal use day in and day out; but if half or more of the equipment is already on-site, the burden of preparation with loading and unloading equipment alone will be reduced, exponentially). Last year I purchased Five additional “Shinai” (Bamboo Practice swords) so that I could train students in the Way of Kendo (the Art of the Japanese Sword). At the start of this year, I began to assert and make plans for a Number of potential Arts and Craft Ideas which would bring the students together as a Team, inspiring them, bringing on a new level of respect for themselves, their peers, and their gear. Some of my Arts and Crafts Ideas are as follows:</p>
<br/><ul>
<li><p>Bogu Armor Cubby’s (Basically Lockable Lockers With Sign-In/Out-Sheets):</p></li>
<ul><li><p>With Top Container for Shinai Practice Swords.</p></li></ul>

<ul>
<li><p>Gaining Appreciate For Gear through Self Worth</p></li>
<ul><li><p>Ex: “I Made This!” and so therefore I have a greater Appreciation for it.</p></li></ul>

<h3>College Improv Tournament - A Summary</h3>
<p>The College Improv Tournament is the largest improv tournament (and festival, really) in the world.  Last year, we had 126 teams and 13 regional tournaments, and the tournament as a whole took place over 6 months.</p>
<p>Now we are about to begin our biggest year ever, with as many as 150 teams nationwide (and some Canadian teams as well) competing in the regional tournaments.</p>
<p><strong>Part 1: What CIT Already Provides</strong></p>
<p>CIT gives not only gives students a goal to work toward during the school year, but it also provides students with the opportunity to make connections with each other as well as regional professionals and theatres.</p>

<p>Food! - We'd like to be able to provide at least one full meal to all teams during the regional tournament.  The best thing we can do, is keep students in the theatre so that they all watch each other.  The day is packed so tight with teams performing, that often groups must miss a match just to have time to eat lunch.</p>
<p>Water! - Bottled water seems easy, but when you have almost 1,000 participants nationwide, and you need to give each participant at least 2, it starts to add up.  Better funding = better hydration.</p>
<p>Hotel Packages - Many of our groups are traveling at least 3-4 hours to compete in the tournament, and we can foster better connections if we can provide them discouted rates at one hotel.  That way, all the students are staying in one place, and connections can go beyond the theatre!</p>
<p>Rental Cars/Lodging - Right now we need to bring more producers and videographers to each tournament, and we need to finally put them in hotels and get them rental cars.  The responsibility and work that each of these producers puts in should be adaquately resciprocated with adaquate housing and transportation (in the past, producers have used public transit and friends' or strangers' couches-- not ideal).</p>
<p>Trophies for 2nd and 3rd place on a regional level - There are so many good teams now (in part due to the tournament) that more teams should be recognized and rewarded.  </p>
<p>Meals for the Judges - All of our judges are professionals who volunteer their time to help the next generation of improvisers, and we'd like to keep them happy by at least offering them food.</p>

College Improv Tournament - A Summary
The College Improv Tournament is the largest improv tournament (and festival, really) in the world.  Last year, we had 126 teams and 13 regional tournaments, and the tournament as a whole took place over 6 months.
Now we are about to begin our biggest year ever, with as many as 150 teams nationwide (and some Canadian teams as well) competing in the regional tournaments.
Part 1: What CIT Already Provides
CIT gives not only gives students a goal to work toward during the school year, but it also provides students with the opportunity to make connections with each other as well as regional professionals and theatres.
CIT participants recieve feedback from professional improvisers acting as judges, as well as the on site producers who open themselves up to all types of questions (improv past college, Chicago, how to stick together and succeed, etc.).
Many students and groups who have competed in CIT Regionals have been invited back by the regional theatres to put on shows or even join the theatre's resident company!
Every match of the College Improv Tournament Season is webcast live and saved online.  This not only provides the ability for family and friends who cannot travel to see CIT teams compete, but also allows all CIT competitors nationwide the ability to see what other teams are doing.  All shows are also recorded on a backup camera in the case of a lost connection.  
At the National Level, CIT provides the top teams in the country to meet, perform, and gain industry contacts during their weekend in Chicago.  as many as 13 judges (live and watching the online webcast) tally in to decide the winners of each round.  This ensures that all schools of thought on improv are represented.  
At the National level of the tournament, all teams are at a professional level of performance.  The judges at the Nationals always speak about the quality of the groups and how they put on better shows than most groups in Chicago.  
CIT Nationals gives students the opportunity to be seen and make contacts with some of the best improviser professionals Chicago has to offer.
CIT is part of Chicago Improv Festival's Educational Outreach Program. The Chicago Improv Festival Productions' mission is to celebrate the present, honor the past, and showcase the future of improvisational theatre, in all of its multi-disciplinary expressions, through local, regional, national, and international prespectives; by presenting and producing performances and workshops for both the general public and practicing improvisational theatre artists.

Hotel Packages - Many of our groups are traveling at least 3-4 hours to compete in the tournament, and we can foster better connections if we can provide them discouted rates at one hotel.  That way, all the students are staying in one place, and connections can go beyond the theatre!
Rental Cars/Lodging - Right now we need to bring more producers and videographers to each tournament, and we need to finally put them in hotels and get them rental cars.  The responsibility and work that each of these producers puts in should be adaquately resciprocated with adaquate housing and transportation (in the past, producers have used public transit and friends' or strangers' couches-- not ideal).
Trophies for 2nd and 3rd place on a regional level - There are so many good teams now (in part due to the tournament) that more teams should be recognized and rewarded.

About the campaign





I'm far from being a great photographer, but I've taken some nice pictures in my travels - most of them of beautiful Peruvian landscapes. I want to share one of my pictures with every person who helps me complete my MBA budget.Back in April, I was accepted to a Top 10 MBA program in Madrid. Unfortunately, I was a little late to ask for financial aid from the school. I ended up asking for the money I needed on student loan from my bank in Peru. The period to pay back these loans is only 7 years so the total amount of money I could get from the bank was not enough to pay for my MBA. I am planning to sell all my belonging (including my camera!) to complete my MBA budget, but I still need $6,000 more to cover my living expenses. I can only promise that as soon as I have a job again I will help others as you are helping me. I can pay this forward!

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>My name is Meaghann, and I am currently a student at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee. I am a nursing major, and I one day aspire to be a part of the humanitarian organization, MSF. In order to gain insight on volunteering abroad, I am spending my winter break in a Costa Rican orphanage. My first day in the country will be 1/2/2012, and I will be there for two weeks. <br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Costa Rica on the back of strong resources, a stable Government and increasing tourism is becoming one of the more affluent countries in Central America. However this is causing problems whereby citizens from neighboring countries (such as Nicaragua) are immigrating into Costa Rica, causing an increase in unemployment, homelessness and poverty. The aim of our <strong>childcare </strong>program is to provide individual attention and assistance to children from difficult backgrounds in <strong>Costa Rica</strong>. Many children at the projects we work with do not receive the level of affection and education that they deserve, and volunteers therefore play an important role in working alongside local staff to improve the educational, emotional, and hygiene conditions of the children. Volunteers will work in orphanages, community centers, daycare centers, schools, soup kitchens and kindergartens. Work varies but generally consists of providing individual attention, sharing affection with children, paying with children, organizing games and activities, educating children regarding hygiene and assisting with home work.<br/></p>

</div></div>","My Story
My name is Meaghann, and I am currently a student at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee. I am a nursing major, and I one day aspire to be a part of the humanitarian organization, MSF. In order to gain insight on volunteering abroad, I am spending my winter break in a Costa Rican orphanage. My first day in the country will be 1/2/2012, and I will be there for two weeks. 


The Impact
Costa Rica on the back of strong resources, a stable Government and increasing tourism is becoming one of the more affluent countries in Central America. However this is causing problems whereby citizens from neighboring countries (such as Nicaragua) are immigrating into Costa Rica, causing an increase in unemployment, homelessness and poverty. The aim of our childcare program is to provide individual attention and assistance to children from difficult backgrounds in Costa Rica. Many children at the projects we work with do not receive the level of affection and education that they deserve, and volunteers therefore play an important role in working alongside local staff to improve the educational, emotional, and hygiene conditions of the children. Volunteers will work in orphanages, community centers, daycare centers, schools, soup kitchens and kindergartens. Work varies but generally consists of providing individual attention, sharing affection with children, paying with children, organizing games and activities, educating children regarding hygiene and assisting with home work.

My name is Johnel Barron aka “Mr.
B,” founder and creator of the Teach Me How To Study™
Program an element of my larger entity iSTRIVE,
a multimedia movement dedicated to the guiding principles of service, hope and
achievement for the millennial generation. 

 My
belief: Without education, success is impossible. 

 Over the past 12 months, I’ve brought the Teach Me How To Study™ motivational message with its tools for
success in schools to 6,000 students live and in person in Los Angeles and
Atlanta. But that is only the start! With your support, over the next 18
months, I can reach millions of students across the country via
the Teach Me How To Study™ Tour.
 My organization’s aim is to
motivate, inspire and educate students in high school to not just start school,
but to finish. To encourage lifelong learning. College may not be for everyone,
but learning is.
 I just want to shout this message from
the rooftops!  I want to bring this message to the masses! This Is For The Community 
Every
year 1.2 million students drop out of high school and over 54% of students that
start college, do not finish. By motivating student audiences to focus on their
studies and to realize that it’s not just for school that we learn, it’s for
life, we will fulfill our mission of creating and nurturing tomorrow’s leaders
today. 
We help students launch from school and land in life.
Public education in America is at a crossroads. The current system is
too expensive to sustain and it does not consistently provide students with the
skills they need to be responsible, contributing citizens in today’s global
community. And yet we know that the educators, parents and students want it to
be different. We believe that with the Teach Me How To Study™ Program when you
inspire the heart, the hands and feet will follow. 
 
Teach Me How To Study™ is a national movement leveraging leadership,
life skills, mentoring and educational programming. Teach Me How To Study™
offers a variety of programming options designed specifically for schools and
educational organizations. We conduct workshops for educators who seek to
improve their interpersonal working environments. In addition, we offer
programs for students in the form of team building workshops, youth adventure
programming and inspirational speaking engagements. 
 
Bottom line: We target high school and college students to promote
drop-out prevention, improve GPAs and test scores, and encourage them to
graduate from college. 
Specifically, the Teach Me
How To Study™ mentoring program is helping raise student
achievement by assisting public schools and local efforts across the country to
implement an effective, comprehensive student support model that is based upon
scientifically-based research and effective practices. 
 
That is what the Teach Me How To
Study™ Tour is all about! Putting the
focus back on education. Keeping the students from getting frustrated so they
can finish school and have fun doing it! 
 
It Has to Start Somewhere
It is our goal is to reach millions of students across the country
through the teachings of this program. We’re not kidding! Plans are in the
works. Conversations are buzzing across the country. But a national tour has to
start somewhere and that somewhere is promotion.
 

 This $15,000 cash infusion will allow us to focus on the foundation: 

Website revisions
to include free study resources for students of all ages
 
Website revisions
to include special college preparation section for students and families
 
Video promo production
 
Travel to critical corporate sponsorship meetings
 
Deposits for our kickoff event
 
Creation of promotional packages for key stakeholder   conversations

 

This $15,000 is only a fraction of what we will
need to create this incredible national tour. However, we are a resourceful
team with a remarkable network of people like you who have stepped up to share
this message with your community. Your support is what helps us to stretch this
$15,000 farther than we could all ever imagine.
  Join The Movement Here’s our plan. Raise $15,000 in 5 mini-campaigns
of 15 days each! Bold we know - but as we tell the kids,
anything is possible! Help us move closer to the national tour starting in
early 2012. 
 
With these
mini-campaigns, we can keep the excitement high, build a community of people
interested in national education (like YOU!), and build the foundation for the
tour stops to be announced later this year. Spread The Word
 This movement will touch the
hearts of students, their families and their educators all across the country.
 
Help us share the movement with:
 
People who love children
People who have children
People who know children 
People who love to study
People who want students to have
the tools they need to study
People interested in joining the
dialogue about national education

<p> </p>
<div>
<h3>Who we help</h3>
<p>Stories are how we know our world -- they are the way we learn about each other and the way we learn about ourselves. For people with significant development disabilities, the world can be too small and too quiet because they don't have the language for stories.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What are ""Touching Stories?""</h3>
<p>Touching Stories helps people communicate and connect with others through story. We have been telling special, multi-sensory stories to adults and kids with developmental disabilities since 2011. The story kits we create allow people to enter the world of story through things they touch, smell and manipulate. When we tell these tales we see their faces light up as they understand and connect with our stories, and it's an amazing gift.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>We are a small non-profit organization, made up entirely of people who donate our time, energy and resources to making these stories happen. But we need your help. We want to continue to provide our unique stories to as many people as possible, and we are looking for your support to fund ten new story kits to be distributed to day programs, schools and libraries so that more people can know and hear our stories.</p>
<p>These kits, made of high-quality materials mounted to sturdy canvas boards are costly to create. We spend hundreds of both dollars and hours developing new stories that will engage, delight and teach the special people we serve. Any funds donated above our funding goal means more story kits we are able to donate to a waiting school or agency.</p>
<p>We want our program to be available to anyone who can benefit. We donate our story kits to agencies that serve people with developmental disabilities so that these stories can be told over and over again. Each kit comes with 2 stories and a dvd which quickly and easily demonstrates how to use each of the manipulatives. The training video is an essential piece of each kit, so that those telling the story can learn how to tell them in the same way every time. Through repetition, people with developmental disabilities can increase their vocabulary, understand communication, learn to predict what will happen next, and make connection to the stories within their own experience.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>We are the only organization in the United States doing this work</h3>
<p>If we can't tell the stories, they simply won't ever be told, and the world for people with developmental disabiltiies will remain a little smaller; a little quieter.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The money you donate will help us develop, produce and distribute free of charge 10 Touching Stories kits. Developing stories that integrate all of the senses while working within the limitations faced by people with developmental disabilities involves a lot of trial and error, but once created, these kits can be replicated and made available at a much lower cost. Each Kit contains 2 new stories and a training video. These ten kits can bring story to hundreds of people who have never been part of the world of story before. In addition, your donation will help us produce training videos so that those who work and live with people with disabilities can learn how to tell these stories. This instructional video allows us to get these stories in more hands and allows many more people to benefit from our stories.</p>
<p>What your money pays for:</p>
<p>$7500 for the development, production and distribution of new stories with a unique training video for each new story.</p>
<p>$1500 to replicate and distribute additional story kits and videos. Each dollar we make in excess of our goal helps us get that many more story kits in to that many more hands.</p>
<p>We want the people we help to know who is helping us! As a supporter of this program you’ll be recognized for your donation: a credit on our videos... your company's name and logo on one of our story kit pages... or on the bags that our story kits come in. With some donations, we'll even name a title character after someone special for you and let you decide who will get the story kits!</p>
<p>We are a 501(c)(3) charity, which means donations to our campaign can be tax-deductible --CHOOSE THE PAYPAL OPTION WHEN MAKING YOUR DONATION TO RECEIVE YOUR TAX DEDUCTION.</p>

The manuscripts have been saved from immediate destruction, but the danger is not over. A massive archival effort is needed to protect this immense global heritage from loss.</em></p>
<p><strong>THE STORY OF THE MANUSCRIPTS IS NOT OVER! ******************************************<br/></strong></p>
<p>Thank you all our Indiegogo friends. Your efforts are helping to preserve a priceless heritage for the entire world. OUR WORK IS NOT DONE! The danger to the manuscripts is still urgent. To learn more about how we are continuing our efforts and to contribute, visit our web site at <a href=""http://t160k.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""T160k.org"">http://t160k.org</a> and follow us on Twitter <a href=""https://twitter.com/t160k"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""T160k on Twitter"">@T160k</a>.</p>
<p>We will continue to keep you informed of how your contributions are helping to preserve the manuscripts. Sorry, we cannot offer Indiegogo perks now that the crowdfunding campaign is over.</p>
<p><strong>*********************************************************************************<strong>************************</strong></strong></p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>Abdel Kader Haidara has been steward of his family's library since age 17<br/></em></p>
<p>Though removed from immediate threat, the manuscripts are still jam packed in footlockers used for their evacuation and the current environment of this precious world heritage is significantly more humid than Timbuktu. There are already signs of damage and exposure to moisture.  </p>
<p>The purpose of this campaign is to fund the preservation effort required to store the manuscripts in an archival, moisture-resistant manner during their exile from Timbuktu.  If physical harm from the current packing situation continues and if mold and mildew  spread in the corpus due to increased humidity, the damage will be devastating.</p>
<p><img alt=""Timbuktu is a traditional center of peace, learning, and scholarship"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://tonydowler.com/images/AbdelKader2_250px.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Timbuktu is a traditional center of peace, learning, and scholarship""/></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>Timbuktu is a traditional center of peace, learning, and scholarship<br/></em></p>
<p>By contributing, you are directly funding the archival materials and labor required to save these works. In recognition of your support, we can ensure that your name or a personal dedication will be associated with these works in perpetuity, and we will provide you with a token of your contribution to keep as an enduring memento.</p>
<p>This is a legacy that will continue to enrich our world, with the potential to advance the causes of peace and good governance in Africa and the world for generations.</p>
<h3><strong>About the Libraries in Exile Project</strong></h3>
<p>Libraries in Exile is sponsored by T160K, an international initiative forged in the evacuation of these treasures from Timbuktu and dedicated to protecting and preserving them until they can be returned to their home. It is the center of a growing global family who have pledged to this urgent effort.</p>
<p>Funds contributed to this project will be used to purchase moisture traps, archival boxes, and the additional footlockers required to safely store these manuscripts, as well as to cover the significant labor effort required to unbox and re-pack the manuscripts for preservation.</p>
<p></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>Tamasheq craftsmen learning book and paper conservation</em><strong><br/></strong></p>
<h3><strong>How your contribution makes a difference</strong></h3>
<p>There are over 300,000 unique manuscripts to be saved. We know this is an immense task, but remember that each $30 contribution means the rescue of another irreplaceable treasure.</p>
<p></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>The corpus of manuscripts is incredibly varied and beautiful</em></p>
<p><strong>All supporters</strong> will receive a personalized digital certificate symbolizing your participation in this great adventure suitable for high-resolution printing and framing. You will also be listed as a supporter on the T160K web site.</p>
<p>A contribution of $30 pays the materials and labor costs required to preserve a single manuscript wrapped in a protective moisture trap and stored in its own archival box. These are objects of amazing beauty and represent a tangible benefit to all of humankind.  <strong>All supporters at $30 and higher</strong> will have a personal dedication and a small photo affixed to the box of the manuscripts they helped save, a permanent legacy to your contribution.</p>
<p>In addition, any backer may add to their pledge, in increments of $30, and we will add their dedication to more manuscripts boxes as more are preserved.</p>
<p></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>Every $30 contributed is another manuscript preserved</em></p>
<p>Master photographer and long-time student of Timbuktu Joseph Hunwick is donating five beautiful large-size photographic prints of Timbuktu and the manuscripts to our campaign! These are avaialble as perks at the $500 level. The prints are gorgeously printed by the photographer using archival inks and museum-quality paper.</p>
<p>With contribution of $1000 we will send you a collection of high-quality archival 8x10 prints of photos in our collection. You can see several of these photos on this page and in the campaign gallery.</p>
<p>We are able to offer a limited number of <strong>original illuminated artworks</strong> featuring calligraphy by a Timbuktu craftsman using techniques and materials similar to those used to create the manuscripts. We will discuss your art selection with you. It may be a selection from one of the libraries or something of personal meaning to you.</p>
<p>To preserve an entire footlocker, including the materials and labor, is a commitment that not everybody can bear, but if you have this ability and feel the call to help, your contribution will pay for the full costs and materials to preserve the contents of one of the footlockers evacuated from Timbuktu. Each footlocker contains 300 manuscripts on average. This represents a significant legacy for future culture and scholarship. We thank you. If you are able to support us at this level, we will also  send you a selection of photo prints from our collection and a personal letter of thanks.</p>
<p>We are also able to offer a limited number of Skype conversations, personal conversations, and speaking engagements with Stephanie Diakité who has been personally involved with the preservation and evacuation efforts.</p>
<p>Finally, we can offer an amazing adventure--the opportunity to visit the manuscripts in person in Mali. This entails some risk in the current political situation. We will need to vett you for security purposes and you will be required to sign a waiver and cover your own travel expenses.</p>
<p>And anybody can contribute by spreading the word and telling others about the work we are doing.</p>
<h3><strong>The libraries of Timbuktu</strong></h3>
<p>The corpus of Timbuktu dates back for generations, with numerous private libraries that have been handed down from generation to generation for over 700 years, creating a record of commerce, poetry, scholarship, law, and everyday life that has undiminished power to teach and inspire today. The libraries include manuscripts form Andalusia and Southern Europe, Arabia, Egypt, the Arab trading ports on the Indian Ocean, and Morocco and other centers of medieval learning, as well as the region of Timbuktu itself. Timbuktu is a traditional crossroads of culture and has played a peacekeeper role in the region. The manuscripts chronicle this role. They represent an astounding diversity of topics and authors, including a significant number of women’s voices.</p>
<p>
</p><p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>A book of <em>genealogy</em><br/></em></p>
<p>A cultural heritage of this magnitude has incredible power to bring people together. We saw this power when people from all walks of life, whole villages, and speakers of every language in the region gave their time and effort, even under considerable risk, to help us evacuate them to the south. We believe that securing these manuscripts is a positive step towards a process of enduring peace and a reduced toll of human misery for this entire region.</p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>Not everyone can give monetarily as much as they would like, but you can still contribute. Please help us support this project by spreading the word about this campaign, sharing it using the Indiegogo sharing tools, and telling others the story of the libraries of Timbuktu. We can also use volunteers to help get the word out about our work.

<h3><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Indiegogo campaign is over. Can I still contribute?</strong></p>
<p>We are still actively seeking contributions to preserve the manuscripts. Visit our web site at <a href=""http://t160k.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""T160k"">t160k.org</a> to learn more. Unfortunately, we cannot offer Indiegogo perks now that the campaign is over. We are urgently working to fulfill all the requests and ship the much-needed materials to Mali.<strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Is my contribution tax deductible? </strong>By choice our work does not have tax exempt status anywhere except in Mali. This means that we will pay taxes on contributions made outside Mali and that people who kindly contribute to our work from outside Mali cannot claim a tax deduction for their financial contributions.  </p>
<p><strong>How does the illuminated manuscripts giveaway work? </strong>For our last week on Indiegogo we’re giving away one of our unclaimed high-level perks to one supporter: an original, customized piece of illuminated art. This art will be created using generational techniques by a Malian craftsman living in exile like the manuscripts. To participate, you must contribute to this campaign at the $30 level or higher and share your dedication or a message of support on a social media site with the #T160K tag. On Facebook, simply like and share our Facebook page (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/T160k"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/T160k</a>) with the #T160K hashtag. If you’re sharing on another network, please email us at <a href=""mailto:contactt160k@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">contactt160k@gmail.com</a> and let us know where so we can add you to the list. People employed by T160K, campaign volunteers, or individuals working directly with us on this campaign or their families are not eligible to receive this reward. We will select one person at random to receive the reward. ABOUT THE REWARD: you will receive a hand-made piece of illuminated calligraphy on a theme of your choice drawn from the content of the manuscripts themselves. We will work with you to select your theme and a suitable excerpt.</p>
<p><strong>I want to help! </strong>We can always use your help! To volunteer your time or expertise, please register through our web site <a href=""http://T160K.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://T160K.org/</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Can I feature your story in my blog or publication? </strong>Absolutely! We have a collection of images and information that you can use on our web site. Please feel free to contact us as well if we can help in any way.</p>
<p><strong>Are you available for interviews? </strong>There has already been a lot of interest from the press in this project, and we are happy to help out in any way. <a href=""mailto://contactt160k@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Send us a message</a>, and we’ll respond to you right away.</p>
<p><strong>What does T160k mean? </strong>Early in the evacuation, when there was little help coming from outside Timbuktu, a timely contribution from an unexpected donor enabled us to save the first 160,000 manuscripts. We named our initiative in memory of that event: T for Timbuktu, 160k for the first 160,000 manuscripts.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any plans to digitize these manuscripts?</strong> Efforts to digitize the manuscripts have been ongoing, but they have been interrupted by the current violent uprising. The manuscripts are composed of extremely fragile papers and unstable ferrous inks which literally burn when exposed to traditional ""hot light"" scanning processes. A significant number of manuscripts have already been scanned using cold circuit photography. It’s our dream to provide for the long-term preservation and digitization of these manuscripts once they are out of immediately danger.</p>
<p><strong>Have the manuscripts been removed from Mali? </strong>The manuscripts currently reside in Mali, where they have resided for 700 or more years, and we believe they should remain there.  Everything possible will be done to ensure this. </p>
<p><strong>What proportion of the funds collected is going to preservation and how are they being managed?</strong> Funds donated to this campaign will go directly to covering materials and labor costs associated with preservation, minus the amount required to cover required Indiegogo and PayPal fees as well as the fulfillment of the contributor perks described above. We project fulfillment costs to be 10% of the total funds collected or less. We are paying a fixed fee for assistance in fund raising and no part of the funds collected for this campaign are going to the fund raiser. Abdel Kader Haidara and Stephanie Diakité and their respective organizations will be managing the funds to ensure that the preservation effort uses them as effectively as possible and to the highest standards.</p>
<p><strong>Why are you using crowdfunding to fund this need? </strong>The need to preserve the manuscripts is urgent. We can’t wait for governments and organizations with deep pockets to respond to this need. It is through the efforts of ordinary people that the manuscripts have been preserved this long, and that they have survived the violence affecting Mali today. Crowdfunding is enabling of participation and we believe this is a key to the sustainable safeguarding of the manuscripts. Organizations that wish to partner with us in this effort should contact us at contactt160k@gmail.com.</p>
<p><strong>Who is T160K? </strong>We are dedicated to the protection, preservation and study of the ancient manuscripts of Timbuktu. Our long-term vision is the return of the manuscripts to their home in Timbuktu and to apply the vast knowledge they contain to the peace process in Mali and in other places in Africa. T160K was co-founded by Stephanie Diakité, JC-JD/MBA/Phd and Abdel Kader Haidara.</p>
<p>Stephanie Diakité, JC-JD/MBA/Phd is a jurist and a poverty eradication institutional development specialist working in more than 40 countries in sub-Saharan Africa through her firm, D intl (see <a href=""http://dintlafrica.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://dintlafrica.com/</a>) and a book artist and book and paper conservation specialist.  <br/><br/>Abdel Kader Haidara is the generational curator of one of the most important libraries of manuscripts in Timbuktu and founder of SAVAMA DCI (see <a href=""http://www.savamadci.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.savamadci.net</a>), an association of private Timbuktu libraries committed to public access.</p>

Thank you all our Indiegogo friends. Your efforts are helping to preserve a priceless heritage for the entire world. OUR WORK IS NOT DONE! The danger to the manuscripts is still urgent. To learn more about how we are continuing our efforts and to contribute, visit our web site at http://t160k.org and follow us on Twitter @T160k.
We will continue to keep you informed of how your contributions are helping to preserve the manuscripts. Sorry, we cannot offer Indiegogo perks now that the crowdfunding campaign is over.
*********************************************************************************************************

Though removed from immediate threat, the manuscripts are still jam packed in footlockers used for their evacuation and the current environment of this precious world heritage is significantly more humid than Timbuktu. There are already signs of damage and exposure to moisture.  
The purpose of this campaign is to fund the preservation effort required to store the manuscripts in an archival, moisture-resistant manner during their exile from Timbuktu.  If physical harm from the current packing situation continues and if mold and mildew  spread in the corpus due to increased humidity, the damage will be devastating.

Timbuktu is a traditional center of peace, learning, and scholarship
By contributing, you are directly funding the archival materials and labor required to save these works. In recognition of your support, we can ensure that your name or a personal dedication will be associated with these works in perpetuity, and we will provide you with a token of your contribution to keep as an enduring memento.
This is a legacy that will continue to enrich our world, with the potential to advance the causes of peace and good governance in Africa and the world for generations.
About the Libraries in Exile Project
Libraries in Exile is sponsored by T160K, an international initiative forged in the evacuation of these treasures from Timbuktu and dedicated to protecting and preserving them until they can be returned to their home. It is the center of a growing global family who have pledged to this urgent effort.
Funds contributed to this project will be used to purchase moisture traps, archival boxes, and the additional footlockers required to safely store these manuscripts, as well as to cover the significant labor effort required to unbox and re-pack the manuscripts for preservation.

How your contribution makes a difference
There are over 300,000 unique manuscripts to be saved. We know this is an immense task, but remember that each $30 contribution means the rescue of another irreplaceable treasure.

The corpus of manuscripts is incredibly varied and beautiful
All supporters will receive a personalized digital certificate symbolizing your participation in this great adventure suitable for high-resolution printing and framing. You will also be listed as a supporter on the T160K web site.
A contribution of $30 pays the materials and labor costs required to preserve a single manuscript wrapped in a protective moisture trap and stored in its own archival box. These are objects of amazing beauty and represent a tangible benefit to all of humankind.  All supporters at $30 and higher will have a personal dedication and a small photo affixed to the box of the manuscripts they helped save, a permanent legacy to your contribution.
In addition, any backer may add to their pledge, in increments of $30, and we will add their dedication to more manuscripts boxes as more are preserved.

Every $30 contributed is another manuscript preserved
Master photographer and long-time student of Timbuktu Joseph Hunwick is donating five beautiful large-size photographic prints of Timbuktu and the manuscripts to our campaign! These are avaialble as perks at the $500 level. The prints are gorgeously printed by the photographer using archival inks and museum-quality paper.
With contribution of $1000 we will send you a collection of high-quality archival 8x10 prints of photos in our collection. You can see several of these photos on this page and in the campaign gallery.
We are able to offer a limited number of original illuminated artworks featuring calligraphy by a Timbuktu craftsman using techniques and materials similar to those used to create the manuscripts. We will discuss your art selection with you. It may be a selection from one of the libraries or something of personal meaning to you.
To preserve an entire footlocker, including the materials and labor, is a commitment that not everybody can bear, but if you have this ability and feel the call to help, your contribution will pay for the full costs and materials to preserve the contents of one of the footlockers evacuated from Timbuktu. Each footlocker contains 300 manuscripts on average. This represents a significant legacy for future culture and scholarship. We thank you. If you are able to support us at this level, we will also  send you a selection of photo prints from our collection and a personal letter of thanks.
We are also able to offer a limited number of Skype conversations, personal conversations, and speaking engagements with Stephanie Diakité who has been personally involved with the preservation and evacuation efforts.
Finally, we can offer an amazing adventure--the opportunity to visit the manuscripts in person in Mali. This entails some risk in the current political situation. We will need to vett you for security purposes and you will be required to sign a waiver and cover your own travel expenses.
And anybody can contribute by spreading the word and telling others about the work we are doing.
The libraries of Timbuktu
The corpus of Timbuktu dates back for generations, with numerous private libraries that have been handed down from generation to generation for over 700 years, creating a record of commerce, poetry, scholarship, law, and everyday life that has undiminished power to teach and inspire today. The libraries include manuscripts form Andalusia and Southern Europe, Arabia, Egypt, the Arab trading ports on the Indian Ocean, and Morocco and other centers of medieval learning, as well as the region of Timbuktu itself. Timbuktu is a traditional crossroads of culture and has played a peacekeeper role in the region. The manuscripts chronicle this role. They represent an astounding diversity of topics and authors, including a significant number of women’s voices.

A book of genealogy
A cultural heritage of this magnitude has incredible power to bring people together. We saw this power when people from all walks of life, whole villages, and speakers of every language in the region gave their time and effort, even under considerable risk, to help us evacuate them to the south. We believe that securing these manuscripts is a positive step towards a process of enduring peace and a reduced toll of human misery for this entire region.
Other Ways You Can Help
Not everyone can give monetarily as much as they would like, but you can still contribute. Please help us support this project by spreading the word about this campaign, sharing it using the Indiegogo sharing tools, and telling others the story of the libraries of Timbuktu. We can also use volunteers to help get the word out about our work. Please visit our web site at http://T160K.org/ if you would like to register to volunteer.

Frequently Asked Questions
The Indiegogo campaign is over. Can I still contribute?
We are still actively seeking contributions to preserve the manuscripts. Visit our web site at t160k.org to learn more. Unfortunately, we cannot offer Indiegogo perks now that the campaign is over. We are urgently working to fulfill all the requests and ship the much-needed materials to Mali.
Is my contribution tax deductible? By choice our work does not have tax exempt status anywhere except in Mali. This means that we will pay taxes on contributions made outside Mali and that people who kindly contribute to our work from outside Mali cannot claim a tax deduction for their financial contributions.  
How does the illuminated manuscripts giveaway work? For our last week on Indiegogo we’re giving away one of our unclaimed high-level perks to one supporter: an original, customized piece of illuminated art. This art will be created using generational techniques by a Malian craftsman living in exile like the manuscripts. To participate, you must contribute to this campaign at the $30 level or higher and share your dedication or a message of support on a social media site with the #T160K tag. On Facebook, simply like and share our Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/T160k) with the #T160K hashtag. If you’re sharing on another network, please email us at contactt160k@gmail.com and let us know where so we can add you to the list. People employed by T160K, campaign volunteers, or individuals working directly with us on this campaign or their families are not eligible to receive this reward. We will select one person at random to receive the reward. ABOUT THE REWARD: you will receive a hand-made piece of illuminated calligraphy on a theme of your choice drawn from the content of the manuscripts themselves. We will work with you to select your theme and a suitable excerpt.
I want to help! We can always use your help! To volunteer your time or expertise, please register through our web site http://T160K.org/. 
Can I feature your story in my blog or publication? Absolutely! We have a collection of images and information that you can use on our web site. Please feel free to contact us as well if we can help in any way.
Are you available for interviews? There has already been a lot of interest from the press in this project, and we are happy to help out in any way. Send us a message, and we’ll respond to you right away.
What does T160k mean? Early in the evacuation, when there was little help coming from outside Timbuktu, a timely contribution from an unexpected donor enabled us to save the first 160,000 manuscripts. We named our initiative in memory of that event: T for Timbuktu, 160k for the first 160,000 manuscripts.
Are there any plans to digitize these manuscripts? Efforts to digitize the manuscripts have been ongoing, but they have been interrupted by the current violent uprising. The manuscripts are composed of extremely fragile papers and unstable ferrous inks which literally burn when exposed to traditional ""hot light"" scanning processes. A significant number of manuscripts have already been scanned using cold circuit photography. It’s our dream to provide for the long-term preservation and digitization of these manuscripts once they are out of immediately danger.
Have the manuscripts been removed from Mali? The manuscripts currently reside in Mali, where they have resided for 700 or more years, and we believe they should remain there.  Everything possible will be done to ensure this. 
What proportion of the funds collected is going to preservation and how are they being managed? Funds donated to this campaign will go directly to covering materials and labor costs associated with preservation, minus the amount required to cover required Indiegogo and PayPal fees as well as the fulfillment of the contributor perks described above. We project fulfillment costs to be 10% of the total funds collected or less. We are paying a fixed fee for assistance in fund raising and no part of the funds collected for this campaign are going to the fund raiser. Abdel Kader Haidara and Stephanie Diakité and their respective organizations will be managing the funds to ensure that the preservation effort uses them as effectively as possible and to the highest standards.
Why are you using crowdfunding to fund this need? The need to preserve the manuscripts is urgent. We can’t wait for governments and organizations with deep pockets to respond to this need. It is through the efforts of ordinary people that the manuscripts have been preserved this long, and that they have survived the violence affecting Mali today. Crowdfunding is enabling of participation and we believe this is a key to the sustainable safeguarding of the manuscripts. Organizations that wish to partner with us in this effort should contact us at contactt160k@gmail.com.
Who is T160K? We are dedicated to the protection, preservation and study of the ancient manuscripts of Timbuktu. Our long-term vision is the return of the manuscripts to their home in Timbuktu and to apply the vast knowledge they contain to the peace process in Mali and in other places in Africa. T160K was co-founded by Stephanie Diakité, JC-JD/MBA/Phd and Abdel Kader Haidara.
Stephanie Diakité, JC-JD/MBA/Phd is a jurist and a poverty eradication institutional development specialist working in more than 40 countries in sub-Saharan Africa through her firm, D intl (see http://dintlafrica.com/) and a book artist and book and paper conservation specialist.  Abdel Kader Haidara is the generational curator of one of the most important libraries of manuscripts in Timbuktu and founder of SAVAMA DCI (see http://www.savamadci.net), an association of private Timbuktu libraries committed to public access.

<p> </p>
<h3>How I Got Started In This</h3>
<p>My name is Jefferson Knapp and I am the author of a children's book series called <em>The Kingdom at the End of the Driveway</em>. In 2010 I was asked to speak at a local elementary school about my newly-published book, <em>The Brave Journey</em>. After seeing the kids' reaction, I decided my passion would be getting children excited about reading.</p>
<p>Before I became an author, I worked as a groundskeeper for a school district. When the economy fell, I lost my job, but luckily I had already started my first book. I have seen first-hand the consequences of budget-cuts to schools. Whether you're for the cut-backs or against them, I've found that most schools are unable to afford high-cost author visits.</p>
<p>I decided to keep my author fee low so any school could afford me; however, I can't reach the school if I can't offset the funds to get there. The impact my presentations have on schools is too important to pass up over the issue of money. There is nothing better than hearing from librarians that their reluctant readers are on the waiting list to check out my books.</p>
<p>Excitement in my book series is spreading with each elementary I visit, but there are many more schools to reach. Imagine the positive impact on this country if a new generation were raised to be avid readers instead of TV junkies and video game addicts. I believe you and I can make a difference!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>How I Will Spend The Money</strong></h3>
<p>The $10,000 I'm hoping to raise will go toward my travels to far away schools and help fund the fourth book in <em>The Kingdom at the End of the Driveway</em> series. It costs close to $20,000 to publish a new book (editing, illustrating, book designing, printing). This money will help pay for part of the cost.</p>
<div>
<p>In return, I will offer some attractive perks for your generous donations: signed dust jackets, books autographed by the author, illustrator and book designer, special thanks in an upcoming book and the opportunity to be a character in Book Four! </p>
