<p><i>Image: Untitled (arches) by Martín Ramírez</i></p>
<p>In the winter of 2018, I was looking at the work of detained writers and artists: <a href=""https://www.mansooradayfi.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mansoor Adayfi</a>, <a href=""https://www.artfromguantanamo.com/moath-alalwi"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Moath al Alwi</a>, <a href=""https://www.artfromguantanamo.com/khalid-qasim-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Khalid Qasim</a>, and <a href=""http://guantanamodiary.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mohamedou Ould Salahi</a>, who were detained at Guantánamo, and <a href=""https://www.riccomaresca.com/portfolio-items/martin-ramirez-estate/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Martín Ramírez</a>, who immigrated to the U.S. in 1925 from Mexico and spent most of the rest of his life detained in U.S. institutions.</p>
<p>I was thinking about materials, the way, when one is detained, one uses whatever's at hand: cardboard painted with stains made from coffee grounds, old shirts stiffened with glue, bottle caps, gravel, sand rock, charcoal from used wooden matches, juice extracted from grapefruits. Ramírez pieced his canvases together from any scrap paper he could find, expanding them in the direction of his interest.</p>
<p>It occurred to me that law is also pieced together out of whatever cases are at hand, and that it too is responsive to our interests and prejudices, though we like to imagine it is smooth, whole, unbiased. I began reading Supreme Court cases dealing with detention and immigration. In <a href=""https://www.oyez.org/cases/2019/17-1678"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Hernández v. Mesa</i></a>, a case involving Mexican boy standing in Mexico who was shot and killed by an American officer standing in the United States, the question is raised: how is this different from a drone strike in Iraq piloted from Nevada?</p>
<p>The Justices want to draw a firm boundary between these two kinds of killing. They might like to hold the man accountable for the murder of the boy, but they don’t want to hold the United States accountable for the murder of, to date, <a href=""https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/projects/drone-war"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">between 769-1,725 civilians, including 253-397 children</a>. They want these killings to remain extralegal, that is, outside the law.</p>
<p>As it happens, illegal and extralegal are different, and what is outside the law can easily move inward, and can, as we've seen, become the law of the land.</p>
<p>An early iteration of <i>Term of Art </i>was presented at the Public Theater as part of the Weasel Festival in August 2018. It featured Schann Rae Mobley, Bryce Payne, and Jenna Zafiropoulos as speakers, and Sara Brown, Andriana Georgitsis, Ash Mayers, and Rava Raab as transcriptionists.</p>
<p>Since then, I've revised and rewritten the play, in part to account for all that has happened since that time. This summer, we workshopped the new script (and filmed footage for the video above!) with Janice Amaya, Megan Branch, Johnathan Dougan, Bryce Payne, and Jenna Zafiropoulos.</p>

In the winter of 2018, I was looking at the work of detained writers and artists: Mansoor Adayfi, Moath al Alwi, Khalid Qasim, and Mohamedou Ould Salahi, who were detained at Guantánamo, and Martín Ramírez, who immigrated to the U.S. in 1925 from Mexico and spent most of the rest of his life detained in U.S. institutions.

The play is a one-man show and the playwright, Jody O'Neil, who also performs his own show, and the director, Margaret Van Sant, will represent Provincetown, Massachusetts at the 2018 IDGTF.</p><p>ANOTHER AIRPORT CLOSING is a brilliant evening of theater.  This one-man comedy tells the story of a groom, who may or may not, have been abandoned at the alter. As he waits to hear from his fiancee, he entertains the audience with the story of his romance with a world-traveling fashion buyer. Will he show up? Or is he stuck in some exotic locale such as Bali, Rome, or Marseille? Should he abandon all hope? Or just dry his eyes and cut the cake? A novel twist answers these questions.</p><p>The show has deep roots in Provincetown, the birthplace of modern American theater. Jody is  member of the Provincetown Playwrights Lab, and the play was performed at the Art House in Provincetown to great success.</p><p><strong>HELP SAILOR BEWARE GET TO IRELAND</strong></p><p>Your contribution (of any amount) will help fund the following:</p><p>Roundtrip airfare from Boston to Dublin for the company</p><p>The cost of a furnished flat (with kitchen and laundry!) in Dublin for them to stay.

(Though they can if they want to).</p><p>Basic groceries to save money on dinner out.</p><p>Other Ways:</p><p>Many of you are artists trying to get your own work up and running... sometimes you're just not able to contribute in cash.

He was a writer and director on the popular WE Network show, “Cinematherapy,” and his short plays have been widely produced in New York and on the Cape.

The play is a one-man show and the playwright, Jody O'Neil, who also performs his own show, and the director, Margaret Van Sant, will represent Provincetown, Massachusetts at the 2018 IDGTF.ANOTHER AIRPORT CLOSING is a brilliant evening of theater.  This one-man comedy tells the story of a groom, who may or may not, have been abandoned at the alter. As he waits to hear from his fiancee, he entertains the audience with the story of his romance with a world-traveling fashion buyer. Will he show up? Or is he stuck in some exotic locale such as Bali, Rome, or Marseille? Should he abandon all hope? Or just dry his eyes and cut the cake? A novel twist answers these questions.The show has deep roots in Provincetown, the birthplace of modern American theater. Jody is  member of the Provincetown Playwrights Lab, and the play was performed at the Art House in Provincetown to great success.HELP SAILOR BEWARE GET TO IRELANDYour contribution (of any amount) will help fund the following:Roundtrip airfare from Boston to Dublin for the companyThe cost of a furnished flat (with kitchen and laundry!) in Dublin for them to stay.

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>My name is Ashley McQueen and I am the Artistic Director of Smashworks Dance Collective. While pursuing my MFA in Dance from Hollins University, I also work as a freelance dancer, choreographer, and teaching artist for Notes In Motion Outreach Dance Theatre and West Side YMCA. Originally from Alabama, I received my BFA in Dance from Webster University and danced professionally in St. Louis for two years before relocating to New York.</p>
<p>Since establishing Smashworks Dance Collective in NYC, I have found my love in every aspect of this company. These dancers and this process have become more than just a creative exploration - Smashworks is my family, my home.</p>
<p>My goal is to continue developing an organization that ignites passion, prompts conversation, and showcases the value of the arts in society.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511806763/mb2rui1bce5hvnfb6sq8.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>The Company</h3>
<p>Now in our third New York season, Smashworks Dance has grown immensely, having doubled the number of dancers and repertory pieces in just two years. From windows on Wall Street to the New York City Transit Museum, Smashworks has performed in over ten festivals across the five boroughs - including last year's ""City Stories,"" an evening length performance at the Center for Performance Research in Brooklyn that was named a ""Voice Choices"" by the Village Voice. Last spring we hosted the Smashworks Film Festival, a dance film screening for emerging and established artists.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Smashworks will premiere FOR WHICH IT STANDS, an evening length work employing 8 performers who brilliantly explore a frightening world of absurd speeches, useless walls, and little plungers for little hands.</strong></p>

Including  cameos from woods-walking Hillary and puppeteering Putin, FOR WHICH IT STANDS invites the audience to confront the contradictions of modern political discourse. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>This work will also include a work-in-process excerpt from my Master's Thesis - a solo that explores the woman body politic in Trump's America and the use of the American flag in concert dance performance. </i></p>
<p><strong>Performers:</strong> Sarah Starkweather, Sarah Dodd, Maria Garner, Maria Vittoria Villa, Jesse Obremski, Ellen Sickenberger, Laurie Deziel, Jenna Rae Smith, and Ashley McQueen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our evening length performance will take place at the Center for Performance Research ""CPR"" on Friday, February 2 and Saturday, February 3, 2018 at 8:00pm. Theater performances are expensive, and we need your help to bring this experience to life.  Your support will contribute directly to dancer wages, theater rental, costume design, and rehearsal space. The full cost of the performance is detailed below:</p>
<p><strong>Theater rental for two evening performances: $1400</strong></p>
<p><strong>Event insurance: $400</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dancer wages [7 dancers]: $2500</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rehearsal space rental: $400</strong></p>
<p><strong>Costume design/construction: $200</strong></p>
<p><strong>Performance Advertising: $100</strong></p>
<p><strong>Total Cost: $5000</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>All funds raised [no matter what the campaign outcome] will go towards paying for the expenses outlined above.</i></p>
<p>In addition to supporting this unique, innovative performance, your contribution will also grant you access to exclusive perks available at a wide range of donation levels from a social media shout out to a personalized dance video.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Dance is an artistic platform that allows us to express personal creativity and to connect with others. Smashworks seeks to stimulate conversation and to bring together diverse perspectives, while creating a safe space for discussion and creative exploration.</p>
<p>In a time of uncertainty, divisiveness, and fear, the Arts (especially through comedy) can break down barriers, bring laughter to the somber, and serve as a platform to foster better understanding of each other.  It is my hope that Smashworks’ performances give the community an opportunity to come together and potentially catalyze political action.</p>
<p>In the past five years of choreographing professionally, my passion for working with dancers and bringing performances to life has grown. In creating this work, I have built upon a record of successful evening length performances in other cities, and with your support, we can continue that success in New York.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As a dancer (and grad student) who works five (5) jobs to cover the costs of running a successful dance company, I understand the challenges of putting on a large production in New York. This performance is important because it provides a paid opportunity for our dancers to perform, network in the New York dance community, and have a positive professional experience that challenges them physically and artistically.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>It is my goal to present this politically charged work during its relevancy.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>It is our job as artists to resist, make waves, and provide an outlet of expression for those in our community.</strong></p>
<p> </p>

<h3>American Maniacs unLimited presents: The Spiro Agnew Memorial Variety Hour and Fish Fry Now With Real Fish!</h3>
<p><i>In our nation's capital! During an election year! While there's an impeachment taking place!</i><br/><br/>Or so we hope to, if we can procure the funds needed to be able to travel to Washington, D.C to perform at the 2020 Capital Fringe Festival!<br/><br/>We are a Chicago-based Sketch Combat ensemble. We're like if Monty Python and Mel Brooks had a baby, and then the Animaniacs taught that baby how to sword fight. We are veterans of Elgin Fringe Festival and are looking to expand our reach!<br/><br/>In this American Maniacs unLimited original production, audiences can expect to see poetry, interpretive dance, cartoon violence, minimal ad breaks, Magic, unwavering eye-contact, Vikings, and perhaps the name sake of the event itself, only at The Spiro Agnew Variety Hour and Fish Fry Now with Real Fish!</p>
<p>So take flight on the wings of an eagle and soar majestically into this bizarre hellscape of artistic expression. <strong>Help us rise above the crippling effects of late-stage capitalism by sending us money and/or sharing our campaign.</strong> We'll take our special brand of satirical comedy right to the scene of the crime and if we're lucky, a senator or two will get to experience our infamous Mitch McConnell sketch.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<ul>
<li>Festival/Insurance Fees, Due in FEBRUARY:<br/>$865<br/><strong><i>Other costs based on previous experiences and market research:</i></strong>
</li>
<li>Flying our 5 person ensemble out to Washington, D.C for the festival in JULY:<br/>$1,735 </li>
<li>Lodging for 3-4 nights during the festival:<br/>$500 </li>
<li>Car Rental/Fuel to haul props and costumes and us back and forth between our lodging and the performance venue:<br/>$400</li>
<li>Food, because we're human... (5 humans, 4 days):<br/>$500 </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Fascism is on the rise again. Comedy has always been an effective weapon against such a rise. American Maniacs unLimited is uniquely positioned to lend our voice in a way most audiences have not yet experienced in a typical sketch comedy show. We have trained extensively in theatre and film acting, stage combat and stunt work, comedy and clowning, studied writing at Second City, and we have a resident history buff/ World War I and II reenactor within our ranks. <br/><br/>We revel in the absurd and the silly, in sharp wit and biting satire. We fight nihilism with optimism, and we fight optimism with nihilism. We offer cathartic release to the downtrodden. And to those who are abusing their positions of power, we punch up. <br/><br/><strong>There are plenty of downtrodden Americans in need of some cathartic release at this particular moment in history. And those abusing their positions of power could really use some getting punched...With comedy. </strong><br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are DIY.<br/>We don't have a board of directors.<br/>We don't have grants.<br/>We don't have a sugar daddy.<br/>We have a lot of student loans.<br/>We have keen awareness of when a joke is considered protected by free speech, and when it is considered treason, but if we were to need to defend ourselves in a court of law, we wouldn't be able to afford a lawyer.<br/><br/>We take that risk anyway because we believe in what we're creating.<br/><br/>Most of our productions closer to home can be staged with little-to-no budget...(Either due to prop/costume accumulation from our many years in the business, or creative slap-dash construction with duct tape and cardboard.) Unfortunately for us, a cardboard airplane won't get us to any of the places we would like to be...<br/><br/>Our show is ready and raring to go for any audience that will have us, but we need help getting to those audiences.

</div></div>","American Maniacs unLimited presents: The Spiro Agnew Memorial Variety Hour and Fish Fry Now With Real Fish!
In our nation's capital! During an election year! While there's an impeachment taking place!Or so we hope to, if we can procure the funds needed to be able to travel to Washington, D.C to perform at the 2020 Capital Fringe Festival!We are a Chicago-based Sketch Combat ensemble. We're like if Monty Python and Mel Brooks had a baby, and then the Animaniacs taught that baby how to sword fight. We are veterans of Elgin Fringe Festival and are looking to expand our reach!In this American Maniacs unLimited original production, audiences can expect to see poetry, interpretive dance, cartoon violence, minimal ad breaks, Magic, unwavering eye-contact, Vikings, and perhaps the name sake of the event itself, only at The Spiro Agnew Variety Hour and Fish Fry Now with Real Fish!
So take flight on the wings of an eagle and soar majestically into this bizarre hellscape of artistic expression. Help us rise above the crippling effects of late-stage capitalism by sending us money and/or sharing our campaign. We'll take our special brand of satirical comedy right to the scene of the crime and if we're lucky, a senator or two will get to experience our infamous Mitch McConnell sketch.

What We Need

Festival/Insurance Fees, Due in FEBRUARY:$865Other costs based on previous experiences and market research:

Flying our 5 person ensemble out to Washington, D.C for the festival in JULY:$1,735 
Lodging for 3-4 nights during the festival:$500 
Car Rental/Fuel to haul props and costumes and us back and forth between our lodging and the performance venue:$400
Food, because we're human... (5 humans, 4 days):$500 


The Impact
Fascism is on the rise again. Comedy has always been an effective weapon against such a rise. American Maniacs unLimited is uniquely positioned to lend our voice in a way most audiences have not yet experienced in a typical sketch comedy show. We have trained extensively in theatre and film acting, stage combat and stunt work, comedy and clowning, studied writing at Second City, and we have a resident history buff/ World War I and II reenactor within our ranks. We revel in the absurd and the silly, in sharp wit and biting satire. We fight nihilism with optimism, and we fight optimism with nihilism. We offer cathartic release to the downtrodden. And to those who are abusing their positions of power, we punch up. There are plenty of downtrodden Americans in need of some cathartic release at this particular moment in history. And those abusing their positions of power could really use some getting punched...With comedy.  

Risks & Challenges
We are DIY.We don't have a board of directors.We don't have grants.We don't have a sugar daddy.We have a lot of student loans.We have keen awareness of when a joke is considered protected by free speech, and when it is considered treason, but if we were to need to defend ourselves in a court of law, we wouldn't be able to afford a lawyer.We take that risk anyway because we believe in what we're creating.Most of our productions closer to home can be staged with little-to-no budget...(Either due to prop/costume accumulation from our many years in the business, or creative slap-dash construction with duct tape and cardboard.) Unfortunately for us, a cardboard airplane won't get us to any of the places we would like to be...Our show is ready and raring to go for any audience that will have us, but we need help getting to those audiences. That's where you fine people come in!

<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>Following the Civil War, The Baltimore Gun Club turns their considerable artillery know how to sending a projectile to the moon. From The Earth To The Moon explores this largely forgotten historic event in a steampunk, revisionist, spectacularly epic fantasy.</p>
<p>I've been interested in adapting this story and it seemed like the 50 year anniversary of the moon landing is as good a time as ever. We'll start with a rough script and flesh out the story in the rehearsal room ... the more we raise the more rehearsals we can afford!! The show will be directed by Ariel Francoeur, Music Directed by Maya Bassuk, Choreographed by Christopher Noffke, with Projection Design by Taylor Edelle Stuart.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>We are looking for $5000 or more. Ideally, we would like to pay the artists, afford rehearsal space, have some scenic elements, and pick up some costumes ... maybe even have a band!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Donate and Share</h3>
<p>Even if you can't give share with those who can! We're hoping this is just the beginning of the life of this project--get in on the ground floor!!</p>

<h3>WHO WE ARE:</h3>
<p>Third Eye Theatre Ensemble presents quality productions of new or seldom performed operatic works that inspire conversation while advocating for human rights and social justice. We want to get people talking about the issues we face in today's world and hope the power of music and theater can inspire those conversations at a community level. This year we are partnering with the Chicago Women's Health Center. Their mission is to facilitate the empowerment of women and trans people by providing access to health care and health education in a respectful environment where people pay what they can afford. For every ticket purchased, Third Eye will donate $1 to this organization.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP:</h3>
<p>We work very hard to ensure all our productions are of the highest quality. One of our goals when we started the company was the ability to perform with an orchestra, rather than performing with only a piano. This is the year we are taking that exciting step! We'll be performing with a 7-piece chamber ensemble. This means we've had to move to a larger, more expensive space and hire a conductor, in addition to the orchestra members. This is a significant expense for us, but we believe it is the direction the company needs to move in order to offer our audiences the best possible experience. We hope you will believe in what we want to achieve and will contribute as generously as you can. Every bit helps, so even if you can only give $5, that still helps us get closer to our goal. With $5, we can buy 1/4 hour of rehearsal space!</p>
<h3>WHAT YOU WILL GET:</h3>
<p>Everyone who donates to our campaign (unless you choose to remain anonymous) will be listed on our website as a supporter of Third Eye Theatre Ensemble. Those who donate prior to 9/17 will be listed in our program. We have some fun perks this year. We are releasing our special Third Eye ""Opera is Better with a Goat"" line of products. It's a little joke we have at Third Eye as a tribute to our former stage director Rose Freeman. It became her motto because she had a crazy desire to put a goat on stage! You'll also get our undying gratitude, which we hope counts for a lot, and a feeling that you are making a difference. Each and every contribution, no matter the amount, helps us tremendously. Plus you're helping to keep the performing arts alive and bringing new opera to Chicago. Who wouldn't feel good about that?</p>

<p>Artist Salaries (Singers, Directors, Designers, Orchestra, Conductor)</p>
<p>Sets, Lighting, Props, Costumes</p>

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>Flash in the Deadpan Productions began as a film company from the minds of Tim Phillips and Sandra Otter. With a natural flair and love for comedy they did what many good artists do and diversified into theatre.</p>
<p>We need your help taking that bold risk of switching from the screen to the stage. We have taken a passion project and want to share it with the world at the Toronto Fringe Festival.

<h3>Why We Need Your Support</h3>
<p>Theatrical shows are very expensive to create and produce. It is a difficult business that is truly fueled by love and ambition but when we go all in, it creates the most rewarding experience for the artists and audiences. We need your donations to help make this production happen! We need to rent rehearsal space, source props and costumes, and most importantly be able to thank the artists who are committing so much time and energy to this fast paced insane show!

<p><strong><u>How much does it cost to put up a show at the Hollywood Fringe Festival?:</u><br/>Venue:</strong> $750- COST COVERED!!<br/><strong>Stage Manager: </strong>$375<br/><strong>Registration Fee: </strong>$170<br/><strong>Insurance: </strong>$125<br/><strong>Misc (Marketing/Props/Costumes/etc): </strong>$100<br/><br/><strong>Total Cost: $1,520</strong><br/><br/>Hi, I'm Brittany Kay Taylor. <br/>I'm here with my good friend Alyssa Yyonne Saenz. </p>
<p>We’re producing a One-Woman-Musical-Comedy entitled 'Molly Goes To Middle School' for the 2018 Hollywood Fringe Festival. We'll be performing at the Hobgoblin Playhouse in Hollywood through out the month of June. It's written by and starring me, Brittany Taylor, in  the title role of Molly… and all the other supporting characters. Alyssa Yvonne Saenz will be doing all the “work” like “directing” and other less visible, less glamorous things that require “skill” and “organization.""</p>
<p>Molly Goes To Middle School is the story of a mid-pubescent tween (played by a 28 year old woman) who is nervous about her first day at a brand new school. In need of courage, Molly prays that God would send an angel to guide her. To her surprise, God sends her Beyoncé. In this -One-Woman-Musical-Comedy-, empowered by the musical styling and feminine prowess of the Queen B, Molly bravely sets out navigate her new jungle gym world.</p>
<p>It’s full of fun, adventure, dancing, singing, drama, bullies, hormones, hygiene, good grades, and artistic interpretations on the nature of God. </p>
<p>You can reserve your tickets NOW! HERE!: <a href=""http://www.hollywoodfringe.org/projects/5434"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.hollywoodfringe.org/projects/5434</a></p>
<p>One of the great things about producing a -One-Woman-Musical-Comedy-, is that they are cost efficient! We already have costumes, props, the script, the music, my human body and comedic talents, as well as Alyssa’s ‘whatever-she-does!’</p>
<p>But we still need to pay for a venue, marketing stuff, …we want to pay this cool chorographer guy, other unexpected expenses that pop up… Alyssa knows, she did the budgeting. <br/> </p>
<p><strong>We’re hoping to raise just $1,500. We have some RAD incentives!</strong></p>
<p><strong>$25 gift….</strong> A personalized video from Molly! Perfect for you, or someone you love. <br/><br/><strong>$100 gift… </strong>A handmade friendship bracelet from Molly! Perfect for you, or someone you love.<br/><br/><strong>$200 gift…</strong> A Middle School Survival Kit! Includes travel size deodorant, panty liners, and a mix tape of Beyoncé’s greatest hits. Perfect for you, or someone you love.</p>

</div></div>","How much does it cost to put up a show at the Hollywood Fringe Festival?:Venue: $750- COST COVERED!!Stage Manager: $375Registration Fee: $170Insurance: $125Misc (Marketing/Props/Costumes/etc): $100Total Cost: $1,520Hi, I'm Brittany Kay Taylor. I'm here with my good friend Alyssa Yyonne Saenz. 
We’re producing a One-Woman-Musical-Comedy entitled 'Molly Goes To Middle School' for the 2018 Hollywood Fringe Festival. We'll be performing at the Hobgoblin Playhouse in Hollywood through out the month of June. It's written by and starring me, Brittany Taylor, in  the title role of Molly… and all the other supporting characters. Alyssa Yvonne Saenz will be doing all the “work” like “directing” and other less visible, less glamorous things that require “skill” and “organization.""
Molly Goes To Middle School is the story of a mid-pubescent tween (played by a 28 year old woman) who is nervous about her first day at a brand new school. In need of courage, Molly prays that God would send an angel to guide her. To her surprise, God sends her Beyoncé. In this -One-Woman-Musical-Comedy-, empowered by the musical styling and feminine prowess of the Queen B, Molly bravely sets out navigate her new jungle gym world.
It’s full of fun, adventure, dancing, singing, drama, bullies, hormones, hygiene, good grades, and artistic interpretations on the nature of God. 
You can reserve your tickets NOW! HERE!: http://www.hollywoodfringe.org/projects/5434
One of the great things about producing a -One-Woman-Musical-Comedy-, is that they are cost efficient! We already have costumes, props, the script, the music, my human body and comedic talents, as well as Alyssa’s ‘whatever-she-does!’
But we still need to pay for a venue, marketing stuff, …we want to pay this cool chorographer guy, other unexpected expenses that pop up… Alyssa knows, she did the budgeting.  
We’re hoping to raise just $1,500. We have some RAD incentives!
$25 gift…. A personalized video from Molly! Perfect for you, or someone you love. $100 gift… A handmade friendship bracelet from Molly! Perfect for you, or someone you love.$200 gift… A Middle School Survival Kit! Includes travel size deodorant, panty liners, and a mix tape of Beyoncé’s greatest hits. Perfect for you, or someone you love.
$300 gift… One of the shows will be dedicated to YOU! (That’s because if you do basic math and division, $300 covers the cost of one whole evening.) Perfect for YOU!$1,500 gift… Molly will babysit for you! (flight not included.) 
Thanks so much for your continued support. 
Best,Brittany Kay Taylor and Alyssa Yvonne Saenz

<h2>Why Head Trick?</h2>
<p>Head Trick Theatre is a performing group based in Providence, RI that puts on innovative productions of classic plays with a focus on the importance of liveness. But doing older work doesn't mean shying away from contemporary issues. Last season, we brought our audiences plays by female and minority playwrights that, centuries later, still speak to contemporary feminist, LGBT, and minority issues, because ""we've always been here""; the female authors of 2018-19's ""Making a World"" offer perspectives on complacency and resistance in the face of rising fascism, and on women's memories, bravery, and imaginations, that ring as true today as ever.</p>

The Plays¤ Watch on the Rhineby Lillian Hellman“It’s an indulgence to sit in a room and discuss your beliefs as if they were a juicy piece of gossip.”¤ From the Farrellys’ living room in Washington, the Nazis and the war in Europe seem very far away – until the war comes to them, when Sara Farrelly brings her anti-fascist husband home after twenty years abroad. Watch on the Rhine confronts an American family with the struggle between fascists and freedom fighters in their own home: Lillian Hellman strips away the civility and intrigue of a comedy to reveal the violence and immediacy of a political thriller, showing us the impossibility of shutting our eyes to the crisis around us.OCTOBER 12–21, 2018¤ Goblin Marketby Polly Pen and Peggy Harmonmusic by Polly Penadapted from the poem by Christina Rossetti“At twilight, halted by the brook,For the first time in my life I began to listen and look…”¤ Two adult sisters return to their childhood home, where they once again come face to face with the perils and fantasies of their youth.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><br/>""What's In Front of You,"" seven short plays written and directed by Joseph Walsh, is a cast of characters and situations that range from the comic and absurd to the tender and human.  Written and Directed by Joseph Walsh.  <b>What's In Front of You</b> debuted in December at the Broadwater Theater, and was enthusiastically received with two sold out shows.  With this campaign we are working to fund a longer run of 6 nights at the end of September for those who weren't able to catch it the first time and those hungry to see it again!</p>
<p>What's In Front of You is Joseph's first work for theater.  His other credits include writing and directing the feature film, ""Girl Missing,"" with Patrick McCartney, Adam McKay, Kate Walsh and Amy Poehler and co-Writing and co-directing the award-winning short film, ""Model Trapper.""  He is currently developing a new feature film set in Ireland in conjunction with the Irish Film Board; as well as working on a new full-length play.  Mr. Walsh is also and actor and artist. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get<br/>Impact</h3>
<p>Like most independent productions, What's in Front of You is self-financed and produced.  To fund all planned performances, <strong>our goal is to raise $10,000.00 by July 1st.</strong></p>
<p>The funds raised will go toward theater rental costs, rehearsal space, fees for technical support and Stage Manager(s), expenses incurred by our Production Team and the care and feeding of our performers throughout the run.</p>
<p>For this we need YOU!  People who care about theater, new theater, funny theater, weird theater, experimental theater, independent theater; who care about laughter, tears, awe, language, character, surprise, refinement, offense!  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

""What's In Front of You,"" seven short plays written and directed by Joseph Walsh, is a cast of characters and situations that range from the comic and absurd to the tender and human.  Written and Directed by Joseph Walsh.  What's In Front of You debuted in December at the Broadwater Theater, and was enthusiastically received with two sold out shows.  With this campaign we are working to fund a longer run of 6 nights at the end of September for those who weren't able to catch it the first time and those hungry to see it again!
What's In Front of You is Joseph's first work for theater.  His other credits include writing and directing the feature film, ""Girl Missing,"" with Patrick McCartney, Adam McKay, Kate Walsh and Amy Poehler and co-Writing and co-directing the award-winning short film, ""Model Trapper.""  He is currently developing a new feature film set in Ireland in conjunction with the Irish Film Board; as well as working on a new full-length play.  Mr. Walsh is also and actor and artist. 

What We Need & What You GetImpact
Like most independent productions, What's in Front of You is self-financed and produced.  To fund all planned performances, our goal is to raise $10,000.00 by July 1st.
The funds raised will go toward theater rental costs, rehearsal space, fees for technical support and Stage Manager(s), expenses incurred by our Production Team and the care and feeding of our performers throughout the run.
For this we need YOU!  People who care about theater, new theater, funny theater, weird theater, experimental theater, independent theater; who care about laughter, tears, awe, language, character, surprise, refinement, offense!

That means we rely on creative collaboration to produce original and exciting work, and we empower each ensemble member to have an artistic voice in all areas of the production. Our strength lies within each other. We share and utilize our combined skills of physical theatre, dance, circus, improvisation, performance art, music, design, and technical theater.

We studied in Berlin with 33 students from 15 different countries, and through them we learned to make theatre that is more embodied, dynamic, and accessible to the world. We have worked with Familie Flöez, Artists of the MCA, and with Thom Pasculli of Walkabout Theatre. The Whisper Theatre Collective strives to continue making this work. We want to invite our audiences to peer into the dark underbelly of the human experience and engage with the unknown.</p><p>Some of the members of the ensemble are also a part of other amazing companies and events!<br/>We have amongst us founding members of The West, a multi-media storytelling collective based in Chicago and Berlin, and Heels Over Head, a physical performance variety show based in Chicago.

However, we have already taken steps as individuals and as a group to open doors and make deeply rooted connections in the Chicago physical theater scene. We have been part of round-table discussions on national and international touring for local companies in Chicago at Chicago Shakespeare Theater, and have a vast network of combined resources across the nation, as our members come from all over the USA.

<h3>Black Sheep Theatre Company: Theatre Done Differently</h3>
<p>Hello, I am Caylin Bach, a 20-something theatre nerd. For many years I have dreamed of being in a musical. But the fact is... I'm not your typical-looking performer. I'm a plus-sized person of color with chronic pain. Not many casting directors see me as 'Elle Woods'. The more I thought about my situation, the more I began to think there must be people like me--people who want to be in a production but feel discouraged by who they are. In my mind the wheels began to turn. If I want to see a change, I have to create it myself.</p>
<p>My idea in creating The Black Sheep Theatre Company was to do several things. </p>
<p>-Create opportunities for actors who are:</p>
<ul>
<li>People of color (POC)</li>
<li>Different body shapes</li>
<li>LGBTQIA</li>
<li>Living with a disability</li>
<li>Underrepresented in theatre</li>
<li>New to theatre</li>
</ul>
<p>-Encourage acceptance and raise awareness for minority actors.</p>
<p>-Involve and develop local talent.</p>
<p>-Entertain and tell a meaningful story.</p>
<p>Even though I initially wanted to wait until COVID was gone before producing shows, I decided that, now more than ever, people need something positive to be a part of. I think that now is the time to pursue this dream. Involving members of my community in a positive project that benefits both the actors and the audience can only be good for us all.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: 700;letter-spacing: 0px;"">What We Need</span></p>
</div><div>
<p>Money needed for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Production rights- about $1,000</li>
<li>Filming/editing/streaming- about $2,500</li>
<li>Costumes/make-up- about $2,000</li>
<li>Promotion and marketing- about $500</li>
</ul>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>Some of our perks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Black Sheep T-Shirt</li>
<li>Signed cast poster</li>
<li>A cameo in the show</li>
<li>And much more!</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if the Black Sheep Theatre Company doesn't reach its goal, your money will still help in funding our first production.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By continuing to diversity theatre in our community, we:</p>
<ul>
<li>create an ongoing dialogue in our community.</li>
<li>allow more people to feel included.</li>
<li>inspire more creators to hire different types of actors.</li>
<li>see talented people succeed.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a 5-year-old POC girl sees a person who looks like her on stage, she too can envision herself as an actress. When we give young people the chance to see themselves in others, we give them a window into their possible future.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I know you value transparency. By being open and honest with you about our challenges, I hope to show you how I can handle them. Here's what we are up against.</p>
<ul><li>COVID-19</li></ul>
<p>The novel coronavirus has made live theatre difficult, but by no means impossible. My plan to handle this is simple and very effective. We will audition, rehearse, and run through the production on Zoom. We will record the performance with social distancing and with the actors individually. We will use the power of editing to create a fantastic show. At performance time, we will stream the recorded version online. </p>
<ul><li>First Show</li></ul>
<p>At some point, all theatre companies have a first show. Some go better than others, but the advantage of a virtual production is the amount of control the production team has. We can work together to make the debut production go as smoothly as possible; and we can try new things, because virtual productions are new to most companies.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You may not be able to contribute now, but that doesn't mean you can't help. You can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the word out and make some noise about our campaign.</li>
<li>Contact me about other resources you may have.</li>
<li>Consider telling a friend about our shirts, the profits still go to our production! Buy them at: <a href=""https://www.bonfire.com/support-black-sheeps-debut-production/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.bonfire.com/support-black-sheeps-debut-production/</a>

</ul>
<p>Thank you for your time!</p>

-Involve and develop local talent.
-Entertain and tell a meaningful story.
Even though I initially wanted to wait until COVID was gone before producing shows, I decided that, now more than ever, people need something positive to be a part of. I think that now is the time to pursue this dream. Involving members of my community in a positive project that benefits both the actors and the audience can only be good for us all.
What We Need

Money needed for:

Production rights- about $1,000
Filming/editing/streaming- about $2,500
Costumes/make-up- about $2,000
Promotion and marketing- about $500

What You Get
Some of our perks include:

Black Sheep T-Shirt
Signed cast poster
A cameo in the show
And much more!

Even if the Black Sheep Theatre Company doesn't reach its goal, your money will still help in funding our first production.

The Impact
By continuing to diversity theatre in our community, we:

create an ongoing dialogue in our community.
allow more people to feel included.
inspire more creators to hire different types of actors.
see talented people succeed.

If a 5-year-old POC girl sees a person who looks like her on stage, she too can envision herself as an actress. When we give young people the chance to see themselves in others, we give them a window into their possible future.

Risks & Challenges
I know you value transparency. By being open and honest with you about our challenges, I hope to show you how I can handle them. Here's what we are up against.
COVID-19
The novel coronavirus has made live theatre difficult, but by no means impossible. My plan to handle this is simple and very effective. We will audition, rehearse, and run through the production on Zoom. We will record the performance with social distancing and with the actors individually. We will use the power of editing to create a fantastic show. At performance time, we will stream the recorded version online. 
First Show
At some point, all theatre companies have a first show. Some go better than others, but the advantage of a virtual production is the amount of control the production team has. We can work together to make the debut production go as smoothly as possible; and we can try new things, because virtual productions are new to most companies.

Other Ways You Can Help
You may not be able to contribute now, but that doesn't mean you can't help. You can:

Get the word out and make some noise about our campaign.
Contact me about other resources you may have.

The eleven dancers performing in this work will be accompanied by live, original music, composed and performed by Matt LaRocca, along with five additional musicians. Vocals will be performed by Roxanne Vought, and Allison and Cameron Steinmetz. <br/>Mark your calendars! The performances will take place <strong>February 21-22, 2020</strong> at <strong>The Main Street Landing Performing Arts Center in Burlington VT</strong>, and <strong>February 28-29, 2020</strong> at<br/><strong>Town Hall Theater in Middlebury, VT. </strong><br/> </p><h3>The Work</h3><p>Inspired, in part, by the explorations of gender and gender identity in <i>Orlando</i>, by Virginia Woolf, and <i>Undine Geht</i> (Undine Goes) by Ingeborg Bachmann, <i>They Say A Lady Was the Cause of It</i>  examines the complexities of gender roles imposed by society, as well as the fight to reclaim individual narratives and rewrite what society has prescribed. The eleven dancers performing in this work contribute their own narratives and voices to this important conversation. </p><p>A reflection on gender identity and discrimination, Virginia Woolf's <i>Orlando</i> tells the story of a person who's life spans more than 300 years. Orlando is born male, with the privilege of being a nobleman. After falling into a deep sleep for a number of days, Orlando wakes up female. Lady Orlando must then navigate her role in life as a woman. </p><p>An Undine is a water sprite, like a siren or a mermaid, almost exclusively depicted as female; their stories almost exclusively written by men. Bachmann's <i>Undine Geht</i> is written from the perspective of Undine, herself, and within this context, she examines the difficulties and obstacles of finding her own voice in world made by men for men.<br/><br/>These pieces of literature are part of the extensive research that has gone into this project. We will not tell these stories in work we are creating, but they have informed us and helped us to frame our own narratives within this context. </p><p><i>They Say A Lady Was The Cause of It</i> explores the themes of identity and agency in two parts. Part 1, <strong><i>The Dinner Party</i></strong>, was originally created as Jessie's thesis work at Smith College in 2015. This piece exists as a framework or a setting, in which much of the content is created by the performers themselves, based on their own real life experiences, and so it changes with each new creation. In keeping with the tradition of Tanztheater, a dance form born out of German Expressionism, this work is an exploration of individual experience and emotion, in which the performers will make use of theatrical methods (set, props, costume), and will intentionally reference reality in the creation process. </p><p>Part 2, <strong><i>The Wet Frontier Between Me and Me</i></strong>, is a raw and physical work, in which the performers contend with themselves as they negotiate their relationships with each other and with the audience. </p><h3>
<br/>What We Believe...Why This Work is Important</h3><p>As performers, we seek to connect to the essence of our humanity and to find it within each other. With this work, we seek to create ways of knowing, beyond words and information, factual histories and timelines. We seek to conceive of ways of telling our stories within landscapes both visual and aural, to move ourselves and our audiences closer to our individual truths and our shared memories. We seek to convey, in our own felt senses, who we are in our bodies and how we move our bodies through this world.</p><p>Driven by authentic exploration and expression, the artists in this work create inherent moments and experiences of connection and meaning among the performers and with the audience. We tell stories, both true and imagined, through the mediums of movement and music. Through imaginative and approachable landscapes, we develop our individual and shared relationships with performance, continuously looking for ways to conceive, create, connect, and convey. Art provides us all, creators, performers, and viewers, with an intimate lens through which we can explore how we locate ourselves in the world. And locate ourselves, <strong>we must</strong>, because there is so much work to be done.</p><p> </p><h3>The Collaborators</h3><p>As a dancer who came to the form later in life than many, creator and choreographer,<br/><strong>Jessie Owens</strong> is interested in pushing the parameters and boundaries of dance. She graduated Summa Cum Laude from Smith College in 2015, with a major in Dance and a minor in German when she was 36 years old. The experience of formal training at this stage of her life, combined with her practical knowledge, contextualized her previous dance experience, and helped her to hone a new approach to her work. In 2015, she founded ERGO/movement, a performance project based in Burlington, VT, where she seeks to create works that are accessible to both dancers and audience. </p><p>With ERGO/movement, Jessie has created, produced, and performed site-specific works, an evening-length concert, and multiple improvisational performances and informal showings. She presented work at DanceFest Vermont at Castleton University in 2016, and at the Vermont Dance Alliance Winter Gala in 2018 and 2019. She collaborated with singer/songwriters, Shannon Hawley in 2015, and Emma Back in 2018. In 2015, she presented work at Qrosswalk, a queer and women-centered art and music event, and at Pushing a Brain Uphill -a multimedia showcase in 2016. In 2018, Jessie was hired to choreograph Vermont Stage’s production of <i>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime. </i></p><p>From 2002 to 2012, Jessie performed with Burlington’s Spielpalast Cabaret, a non-profit dance and theater company, modeled after German Weimar Era cabarets, and was the group’s art director and co-producer from 2005 until 2013. She co-produced performances annually in Burlington and throughout Vermont, as well as the group’s venture to the Fringe Festival in Edinburgh, Scotland in 2011.</p><p>Jessie is the current Vice President of the Vermont Dance Alliance, a non-profit organization serving as a foundation for dancers and a public platform for dance in Vermont.

<h3>Who are we? </h3>
<p>Caston &amp; Company, originally founded in New York City, is now laying down roots in Detroit. We are a professional dance company under the Caston-Clark Tap Dance Foundation, a 501(c)3 organization dedicated to the advancement of tap dance through performance, preservation and education. We strive to reach underserved communities that are hungry for more exposure to the performing arts.</p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Former Radio City Rockette Denise Caston-Clark is ecstatic to be back in her home state of Michigan, launching Tap Dance Detroit for the community and creating work for the talented artists that call Michigan home.</p>
<p>We are infusing tap dance into the vibrant concert dance scene through creating productions that utilize the world-class talent of Detroit's musicians, and presenting shows at well-known venues in Metro Detroit that will bring wider awareness and appreciation to this uniquely American art form.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We seek $10,000 for our debut season. Here is where those donations will go:</p>
<ul>
<li>Salaries for dancers, musicians and stage technicians. </li>
<li>Budget for costumes, transportation of our floors to performance venues, marketing, PR and the other details that will make our endeavors successful.</li>
<li>Your donations will also help us to hire more dancers and travel to other communities to create more access to dance performances and education. </li>
</ul>
<p>While the concert dance scene in Michigan is vibrant with a plenitude of dance companies from major troupes to those just getting started, there is an absence of tap dance. We want tap dance to be an integral part of the dance scene here. The mass appeal of tap dance is undeniable. Everyone from connoisseurs to people that have never danced love to watch tap dance.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With your help, Michigan too can be a destination to see and experience tap dance in concert. Many productions will travel through, but we are creating a home base right in the heart of Metro Detroit. There will be work for professional tap dancers right here in the mitten, and people will see how tap dance is still thriving and as strong as ever globally! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I moved back to Michigan after being in New York City for years. We moved back to launch Tap Dance Detroit. Anyone who has started a business knows that it is an enormous undertaking. I didn't really have the money to do it, but I did anyway! I jumped into the very deep end because I simply believe that's the only way to do it. Go in! It's been overwhelming, hugely rewarding, and all the emotions in between.</p>
<p>Many major dance companies have corporate sponsors, and with their years-long track record are able to obtain grants from large funding organizations. We will get there but we aren't there yet! Without donors, we simply can't do it. With my history of building Motor City Tap Fest into one of the largest tap festivals in the country, I know what it takes, the time, the patience and the persistence. I know we can become a world-class tap company that will in turn give back to the community. </p>

<h3>Chi siamo?</h3>
<p>Siamo Semi Permanenti,  un collettivo internazionale che unisce i diversi codici dello spettacolo dal vivo ricercando un linguaggio originale e trans-disciplinare. Ci siamo incontrati lo scorso anno e dopo aver condiviso una formazione intensiva abbiamo deciso di continuare a lavorare insieme.</p>

<p>Abbiamo già svolto una residenza artistica grazie al sostegno di Rete Habitat e Sementerie Artistiche, una bellissima realtà che si trova a Crevalcore (BO).</p>
<p>L'energia scaturita da questa esperienza è ancora attiva e impaziente di continuare a manifestarsi in un periodo in cui tutto il sistema teatro è in pausa.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Let’s find wonder in the face of grief!</h2>
<p>I am Mieke D, an interdisciplinary dance, theater, and performance-maker based in Philadelphia, PA bringing together an ensemble of artists to produce a new work of site specific theater for our pandemic times. It’s my birthday week, and I want nothing more than to raise $2000 in order to workshop my project, Mortal Meal Services, in November 2021!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What is Mortal Meal Services?</h3>
<p>Mortal Meal Services is a site specific, promenade-style, scavenger-hunt inspired play that takes audiences of one throughout a local cemetery to find wonder in the face of grief. This whimsical, interactive journey unfolds through rituals, stories, games, puzzles, riddles, songs, and many quiet moments to help audiences contemplate: How can we find joy within landscapes of loss? Connection within chaos? Beginnings within endings?</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why now?</h3>
<p>This is a time of re-emergence for so many of us, with more opportunities to contemplate what we are returning to, what has changed, and what is possible. In this moment of a little more breath, there is a lot to integrate, to grieve, and to retrieve. This project hopes to offer creators and audiences a playful, supported way of doing some of that reflecting through play and fun, while making room for reimagining what comes next.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Who is involved?</h3>
<p>Our current ensemble includes a Director, Stage Manager, 3 Creator-Performers and Puppeteer. I am looking to add a props and objects designer and a Disability Justice Consultant as well! </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What are we fundraising for?</h3>
<p>This funding will allow me to produce some much-needed workshop showings of this interactive outdoor project, before the winter descends again and we have to go back inside! It will allow me to pay my collaborators for their invaluable time devising and performing; hire a production stage manager and prop designer; and increase the accessibility of this piece in as many ways as possible before attempting a full run of this ambitious project in 2022!</p>
<p>We have already received support from the Leeway Foundation (Art &amp; Change Grant), the Network of Ensemble Theaters (NET/TEN), and Illuminate the Arts—the first grants I have ever received for an original project in my life. This generous support will allow us to workshop and develop the project through September, and work towards a full run in 2022, but between that... we’re broke! The dream is real, and the momentum is building, but we need your help to workshop this project with audiences in November!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">If you are excited about socially distant performance, queer and disabled leadership within a majority-BIPOC team, and values-driven art with a flare for the ridiculous - DONATE NOW!</h3>

<p>For those unfamiliar with the term, a shadowcast is a group of performers who re-enact a film while it plays on a screen behind them. The performers and audience add their own unique twists to what is seen on screen, whether that is achieved by shouting at the screen (callbacks), dancing, throwing items like confetti, or using visual/physical humor.

Story of <i>In/Visible City</i></b></p>
<p>The story of <i>In/Visible
City </i>begins in 2005, when DAH Theatre, the single professional alternative
theatre in Serbia which has been actively creating since 1991, embarks on a
journey with a wish to destigmatize the question of differences, national
minorities and xenophobia. The journey is not just a metaphorical one, but a
literal one - through the capital of Serbia, Belgrade. In search of ways to
connect its citizens and educate them about all of the things that bring us
together despite our differences, we decided to make an interactive
performance, on a city bus line that connects two culturally exceedingly contrasted
ends of the city. Various dramatic, dance and musical scenes, emerging from an
original script that was created from the stories, dances and music which relate
to the particular part of the city which the bus is going through, change and
draw the passengers into those magical and inspirational stories filled with
love, understanding, perseverance and compassion.</p>
<p>By putting theatrical action into a city bus, the
prosaic situation of city transportation is made uncommon, and the richness of
diversities that we carry daily within ourselves suddenly rises into focus. The
bus is a condensed space in which our coexistence and our tolerance for the Other
is being put to the test on a daily basis. </p>
<p>In 2005, all of the passengers who embarked on a
journey with us experienced a great deal of surprise, and all of the stories
were met with approval and support. Many passengers decided not to get out on
their stop, but to stay until the end of the performance. The busses were
crowded, and other people had to wait for another bus because they couldn’t get
in. Some even hailed a cab hoping to get into the bus at some of the following
stops. Some went out of the bus visibly shaken up saying ’’What have they done
to us?’’. Our usually somber co-citizens would often climb off the bus with wide
smiles on their faces. During this magical journey, passengers were able to
obtain additional information about the project from flyers handed out at bus
entrances.</p>
<p>Seeing the huge success this project had in 2005, DAH
Theatre decided to extend it to the entire country in 2007/08.</p>
<p>In 2008 we successfully implemented the European pilot
project  <i>In/Visible City</i> in Norway, and with a wish make a contribution to
normalization of relations between various ethnic communities throughout Europe
and development of a civic society based on tolerance, we implemented this
project across Europe.</p>
<p>In 2010 we became the first Serbian organization to have
become a holder of a project within an EU program entitled <i>Culture 2007-13</i>. Our bus went on a visit to four countries with
four partners from Denmark, FYR Macedonia, Great Britain and France.</p>
<p>This project received an award from ERSTE Foundation for
the best project in the field of social integration.</p>
<p>In 2014 <i>In/Visible City </i>was implemented in
Sardinia. </p>
<p><b>Making
<i>In/Visible City</i> Visible in 2015</b></p>
<p>This year we are celebrating a jubilee that we wish to
mark by once again starting our busses’ engines and heading on a tour through
our country, reminding it about all of those values that seem to have fallen
into oblivion during the last several years. We begin celebrating the 10<sup>th</sup>anniversary
of <i>In/Visible City </i>in Novi Sad, the city
known for its richness of cultures and influences from diverse ethnic
minorities. In light of recent incidents of attacks on members of national
minorities, we believe this project to hold special importance. Attackers were
prevalently young people, so this years-long project is focused on the youth, aiming
to offer a different kind of picture to our society and a possibility to
inhabit a different, constructive place in it. We are continuing our little
journey we continue towards Inđija, a city filled with contrasts, diversities,
history and conflicts. Our final destination is also our starting point –
Belgrade – along the bus line that connects diverse cultures, various histories
and stories.</p>
<p>To achieve this we need your support. </p>
<p>To be more specific: DAH Theatre has succeeded in
gathering funds for implementation of this project in Novi Sad and Inđija, but
we are in need of funds to travel a full circle with our project and dance one
more dance at its birthplace. To reach this goal, we need exactly 12,000 euro,
and so we reach out to all of you who are willing to help spread peacebuilding
and tolerance, multiculturalism and to support putting an end to violence directed
at all of those who are different in one way or another. </p>

Since the inception of the company, we have performed our repertoire at various professional concerts and dance festivals in North and South Carolina. Due to funding purposes THE MARK has always worked jointly with other artists to produce multi-company shows (showcasing only 1 - 2 of our own works in each concert). Thanks to the Charlotte Dance Festival, THE MARK will be able to produce our first full-length concert The Next Step on March 19th, 12pm, at the Duke Energy Theater in Charlotte, NC.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>About ""The Next Step"" concert:</h3>
<p>The Next Step is a 90 minute concert showcasing the culmination of several dance repertoire pieces we have set on the company since 2012. The concert features 9 dancers and will present 9 works, showcasing one world-premiere, two Charlotte-premieres, a film for dance piece, and the very first piece created for the company’s repertory, all nestled between a collection of audience favorites. The title for this concert depicts THE MARK’s advancement into ‘the next step’ within our company's career.</p>
<p>Through this fundraising campaign, contributors will help THE MARK to off-set production costs that incoming ticket sales will not cover. As a company, we want to not only cover the facility and technical costs, but also provide our dancers with some form of compensation for the hard work and long hours they have put into creating and presenting this concert.</p>

</div></div>","About THE MARK dance company: THE MARK dance company was founded in 2012 by Artistic Director, Arlynn Zachary. Since the inception of the company, we have performed our repertoire at various professional concerts and dance festivals in North and South Carolina. Due to funding purposes THE MARK has always worked jointly with other artists to produce multi-company shows (showcasing only 1 - 2 of our own works in each concert). Thanks to the Charlotte Dance Festival, THE MARK will be able to produce our first full-length concert The Next Step on March 19th, 12pm, at the Duke Energy Theater in Charlotte, NC.


About ""The Next Step"" concert:
The Next Step is a 90 minute concert showcasing the culmination of several dance repertoire pieces we have set on the company since 2012. The concert features 9 dancers and will present 9 works, showcasing one world-premiere, two Charlotte-premieres, a film for dance piece, and the very first piece created for the company’s repertory, all nestled between a collection of audience favorites. The title for this concert depicts THE MARK’s advancement into ‘the next step’ within our company's career.
Through this fundraising campaign, contributors will help THE MARK to off-set production costs that incoming ticket sales will not cover. As a company, we want to not only cover the facility and technical costs, but also provide our dancers with some form of compensation for the hard work and long hours they have put into creating and presenting this concert.
   Breakdown of Concert Expenses:

$300: CDF Administration Fee
$250: Campaign Administration Fee (if full funding is obtained)
$800: Theater
$540: Lighting Designer
$150: Stage Manager
$150: Videographer
$200: Costumes (we are excited to be designing and creating a new set of costumes for the world-premiere of our newest piece, Paloria!)
$2,500: 1 Choreographer & 9 dancers (rehearsals/performance stipend)

Total Expenses: $4890
Estimate Income from tickets: $2,500
Campaign Goal: $2,400 (Exciting fact: If THE MARK raises at least $1k in this campaign, our fiscal agent Fractured Atlas will sponsor us in the pursuit of applying for future grants to help found the company!!!)

If we do not reach a minimum of $2,400 in our advertising campaign, THE MARK will need to cut-down on the small stipend each of the 9 dancers and the choreographer will receive. All other costs are fixed prices and must be paid for the show to be produced. If ticket sales do not cover the facility/technical costs of the concert itself, the Artistic Director will need to cover any additional expenses out-of-pocket.

ALL DONATIONS ARE TAX-DEDUCTABLE!!!!!

Also, we invite you to come to the show!.  More information on the performances can be found here:  http://www.lpac.nyc/rough-draft-2017.

<p>Dear Voyeur,</p>
<p><strong>Willkommen, Bienvenue, Welcome</strong>... to Berlin's most provocative Weimar Cabaret experience: <strong><a href=""http://www.kabarettdernamenlosen.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kabarett der Namenlosen</a>.</strong> Originally created by Jewish Conférencier, <a href=""http://www.cabaret-berlin.com/?p=455"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Eric 'Elow' Lowinsky</strong></a>' in 1926, Kabarett der Namenlosen was <i>infamous</i> for presenting only the worst possible talent, in order to satisfy the perverted pleasures of a cruel audience.</p>
<p>Visiting Berlin in 2012, I was instantly intrigued by the title alone, but wanted to reinvent Elow's original concept and offer something dreamier, darker and more poetic. Kabarett der Namenlosen 2016 is presented in English and German and comprises, part <strong>Theatre,</strong> part <strong>Cabaret</strong>, part <strong>Salon</strong> and sometimes <strong>Pantomime</strong>. The show incorporates original music, including period composers: <strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mischa_Spoliansky"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mischa Spoliansky</a>, Bertolt Brecht </strong>and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Hollaender"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Friedrich Hollaende</strong>r</a>, interwoven with bizarre Performance Art, Tableaux Vivants and short 'Vignettes'.</p>

<h3>WHY we need YOUR Contributions:</h3>
<p>Kabarett has been lovingly nurtured with passion, energy and enthusiasm.  Audiences at the show are thrilled, inspired and even slightly unnerved;  theatre is supposed to do that. The show has been produced twice in recent months, to prove it's potential and the response has been overwhelming. To move forward we now need YOUR support to expand the production in 2017, initially in Berlin and then further afield.</p>

<h3>What are we using the funds for?</h3>
<p>We have tried and tested the show on a self funded basis. Now we need more people to discover and believe in the potential of this beautiful creation.. Therefore we need to raise additional funds to cover the Marketing and Production Costs that would help the show to develop and evolve. We aim to raise £15,000 in total:</p>
<p><strong>Marketing: £8.000</strong></p>
<p>This is essential for any emerging show. We need to fund a strong and visible campaign to reach a wider audience and spread the word. The show IS a success but we need the WORLD to know.</p>
<p>In the wise words of<strong> P.T. Barnum</strong> : ""Without promotion, something terrible happens... <i>nothing</i>!""</p>
<p><strong>Production Costs: £7.000</strong></p>
<p>Kabarett is an expensive and extravagant show to stage. The show is presented in an authentic pre-war venue (with original features) thus providing the perfect ""mise-en-scène"" for this spectacle. In addition we need: new costumes, set and a variety of curated props are required to recreate the Zeitgeist of the Golden Twenties. We also need to secure new equipment, hire additional staff and pay for extra rehearsals.</p>

<h3>What is MOTION PICTURE SHOW?</h3>
<p>Founded by Director/Choreographer, Nick Kepley, MOTION PICTURE SHOW is a physical theatre company which challenges its audiences to engage beyond the fourth wall through immersive, site-specfic works. Using a blend of familiar narrative, dynamic physical movement, and beautiful design instillation, the company places audience members at the center of their own story, allowing them to make split second decisions using intuition as their only guide. </p>
<h3>Where does my money go?</h3>
<p>Donations made to this campaign will go directly toward the financing of a developmental lab for REAL LIFE TEST. The lab will be held in a former hosiery mill in Spruce Pine, NC. From there, the show will travel east to be reinstalled in an abandoned Coca Cola Factory in Spruce Pine, NC. There, RLT will open its doors to our first paying audiences. <strong>ALL DONATIONS ARE TAX-DEDUCTIBLE</strong> through the fiscal sponsorship of MOTION Dance Theatre.</p>
<h3>How we say thank you!</h3>
<p>Thanks to several private investors and producers, MPS is only looking to raise $3,500 through this IndieGoGo campaign! This amount will allow us to integrate more sophisticated lighting and sound into the show, and will also help finance performer salaries. We plan to post regular updates on the project, along with behind-the-scenes videos of the creation process as the show progresses. By investing in this show, you will become part of the MOTION PICTURE SHOW family. We're a company that likes to work hard and play harder, and so we've come up with some fun ways to say thank you to our financial supporters!</p>
<h3>Why should I support this project?</h3>
<p>MOTION PICTURE SHOW strives to build experiences that provoke, surprise, entice, and touch audiences in a visceral way not possible through more traditional forms of proscenium theatre. Building a large, multi-story show requires not only years of effort, but large amount of financial support. However, MPS is 100% committed to building worlds which feel completely real and which allow audiences to fall into the spell of whatever story we are telling. </p>

<p>CIANE nace en el año 2002 cargado de ideas, valores, entendimientos, contrastes, sentimientos y una profunda pasión por el  arte y su poder transformador. Con un trabajo inspirado en el poder transformador de las artes, con fines de crecimiento humano y desarrollo social, aunado a la investigación del cuerpo como herramienta del intérprete escénico, las  investigaciones basadas en el estudio de la biomecánica, desarrollando nuestro trabajo en una fusión del teatro físico, la danza, la acrobacia y los zancos, sumando a estas disciplinas, bases del trabajo del CIANE, la iluminación escénica e iluminación corporal diseñada como un intérprete más, como parte fundamental del espectáculo cuando la ocasión lo permite, igualmente la conjunción de elementos que permiten la integración de los espacios tomados como escenario.</p>

<p>CIANE ha representado en muchas ocasiones a Venezuela en importantes eventos internacionales. Es considerado una importante agrupación experimental, como creadores de la Danza de Altura, es una agrupación que se mantiene en una investigación permanente en cuanto al trabajo físico del intérprete y el fortalecimiento de la masificación de las artes escénicas fomentando la intervención en  calles, parques, plazas, estacionamientos, sótanos, montañas y espacios no convencionales en general que logran cobrar vida en un encuentro entre el teatro de Calle, la Danza acrobática, las múltiples disciplinas escénicas posibles fusionadas en espectáculo, comunidad y el espacio público.</p>

<p>El Elenco de CIANE se prepara de un modo intensivo y disciplinado constantemente, ello implica la preparación psico física y estimulación de la creatividad sumado a la vinculación permanente con el entorno, la colectividad, la calle, el medio ambiente, el trabajo eco creativo, y la interacción con nuestros escenarios, entiéndase la Urbe, las calles, la ciudad entera, así como también los ambientes naturales en una constante búsqueda, estableciendo puentes entre la sensibilidad del artista y la importancia de una relación sostenible con la naturaleza.</p>

</div></div>","CIANE nace en el año 2002 cargado de ideas, valores, entendimientos, contrastes, sentimientos y una profunda pasión por el  arte y su poder transformador. Con un trabajo inspirado en el poder transformador de las artes, con fines de crecimiento humano y desarrollo social, aunado a la investigación del cuerpo como herramienta del intérprete escénico, las  investigaciones basadas en el estudio de la biomecánica, desarrollando nuestro trabajo en una fusión del teatro físico, la danza, la acrobacia y los zancos, sumando a estas disciplinas, bases del trabajo del CIANE, la iluminación escénica e iluminación corporal diseñada como un intérprete más, como parte fundamental del espectáculo cuando la ocasión lo permite, igualmente la conjunción de elementos que permiten la integración de los espacios tomados como escenario.



CIANE ha representado en muchas ocasiones a Venezuela en importantes eventos internacionales. Es considerado una importante agrupación experimental, como creadores de la Danza de Altura, es una agrupación que se mantiene en una investigación permanente en cuanto al trabajo físico del intérprete y el fortalecimiento de la masificación de las artes escénicas fomentando la intervención en  calles, parques, plazas, estacionamientos, sótanos, montañas y espacios no convencionales en general que logran cobrar vida en un encuentro entre el teatro de Calle, la Danza acrobática, las múltiples disciplinas escénicas posibles fusionadas en espectáculo, comunidad y el espacio público.

 
El Elenco de CIANE se prepara de un modo intensivo y disciplinado constantemente, ello implica la preparación psico física y estimulación de la creatividad sumado a la vinculación permanente con el entorno, la colectividad, la calle, el medio ambiente, el trabajo eco creativo, y la interacción con nuestros escenarios, entiéndase la Urbe, las calles, la ciudad entera, así como también los ambientes naturales en una constante búsqueda, estableciendo puentes entre la sensibilidad del artista y la importancia de una relación sostenible con la naturaleza.

Importancia de tu aporte para CIANE y para el mundo
CIANE, como agrupación de teatro experimental y laboratorio creativo ha generado un gran movimiento de crecimiento humano y profesional para generaciones jóvenes y también para no tan jóvenes que comprenden la importancia del no sedentarismo. 
En una época en que la tecnología, la globalización y nuevos paradigmas en la comunicación envuelven a la sociedad, ¿cómo puede el teatro ser ajeno a estas posibilidades de transformación?.

La necesidad de un escenario vivo, de un torbellino de energía y flujo de percepciones nos lleva a determinar la importancia de la inclusión de nuevas técnicas actorales transdisciplinarias y multidisciplinarias en los montajes de CIANE, producto de una estrategia de creación generado a partir de la fisicalidad.

<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>My name is <a href=""http://megangogerty.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Megan Gogerty</a>. I'm a playwright and comedian. I'm also a professor at the <a href=""https://theatre.uiowa.edu/people/megan-gogerty"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">University of Iowa Playwrights Workshop</a>. </p>
<p>I've written my fourth full-length solo show, which premieres at Riverside Theatre in Iowa City in February 2017. It's directed by <a href=""http://www.saffronhenke.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Saffron Henke</a> and it stars lil' ole me.</p>
<p>The show is called <a href=""http://www.ladymacbethshow.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Lady Macbeth and Her Pal, Megan</i></a>, and it's about the following things: a) What's it like being a woman in comedy? b.) Sexism! So hilarious! c.) Not Hillary Clinton. d.) Witchcraft - a promising lifestyle choice? e.) We are all Lady Macbeth, yearning and striving and trapped by our own ambition. f.) Delightful, enjoyable rage. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What do I want?</h3>
<p>I want to take my show to the <a href=""https://www.edfringe.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Edinburgh Fringe Festival </a>in Edinburgh, Scotland in August 2017. This is a big deal. EdFringe is the largest arts festival in the world. For three weeks, the whole town hosts thousands of shows, comedians, dancers, street performers, students, and performance artists. It's a ""go big or go home"" situation. I've been home. I think it's time I go big.</p>
<p>Plus, if I'm going to write a play about Lady Macbeth, I might as well do it in Scotland.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Three weeks in Scotland - even with a show as sleek and travel-ready as mine - is expensive. I need to raise $20,000 to make it happen. Here's roughly where the money goes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>$6,000: Venue</strong>. This includes theatre rental, liability insurance, box office commission fees, and  program fees to the Edinburgh Festival Society.</li>
<li>
<strong>$3,000: Marketing</strong>. In addition to working with the EdFringe people, I'm also hiring a professional public relations expert to help my show stand out from the throng. </li>
<li>
<strong>$3,000: Travel</strong>. This primarily means airfare for me and my team.</li>
<li>
<strong>$6,000: Lodging</strong>. It turns out, living in Scotland for almost a month is expensive! And space during the Festival is at a premium. </li>
<li>
<strong>$2,000: Miscellaneous</strong>. This covers food, sim cards so our cell phones work overseas, and other contingency costs. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>My undying gratitude! But also, when you donate at the following amounts, you get fun perks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Any amount:</strong> A public, personalized thank-you splattered all over my social media.</li>
<li>
<strong>$20 Text Vacations! </strong>Give me your cell phone number or email address, and I'll text you three imaginary mini-vacation stories (""You're standing on a beach..."") designed to transport you out of your hectic life for a moment or two. </li>
<li>
<strong>$50 A Mediocre Poem!</strong> A personalized poem of middling quality - but with your name in it! - flung all over my social media.</li>
<li>
<strong>$100 Exclusive Video Diary Updates! </strong>I'll send you video updates regaling you with my adventures in Scotland. It'll be like you're there, only without the jet lag. </li>
<li>
<strong>$500 PDF of an Annotated Script!</strong> I'll send you the script of the show with special notes in the margins - what parts I cut out, which parts were hard to write, etc. A personal tour.</li>
<li>
<strong>$1000 Living Room Show! </strong>If you live within two hours of Iowa City, I'll come to your house and do the show for you and your friends right in your living room.  That's a hell of a theme party.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This show is really important to me. I'm digging deep, telling some hard truths, and trying - please, God - to make it funny along the way. </p>
<p>Some of you have been following my career for some time. Maybe you remember my last solo show, <i>Housebroken</i> (you can watch <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2VONobUk1JPoa9JhW9PpXa8-6qw4Vtc3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the whole show right here</a>). I've taken my shows <a href=""http://www.oxarts.org/portfolio-view/the-solo-projects/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">all around </a>the United States. They've made yearly<a href=""http://www.clatl.com/culture/article/13065076/curt-holman-picks-the-best-in-atlanta-plays-for-2011"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Best Of lists</a>, they've been <a href=""https://www.originalworksonline.com/SAVE-ME-DOLLY-PARTON-by-Megan-Gogerty_p_196.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">published and performed</a> by others, and I've met a lot of great people along the way. </p>
<p>But this show feels different. It feels risky. It feels urgent. After wading through 2016's cesspool of misogyny (You didn't notice? Just me, then? That's fine), I want to speak to these issues in a way that is warm and empathetic. I want to share my story with the world. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>How am I going to get over there? What if I don't like Scottish food? What if they don't understand my thick American brogue? </p>
<p><i>Deep breath, Megan. One thing at a time.</i></p>
<p>Live theatre is always a risk, and it's hardly ever a money-maker. That's not why we do it. We do it because the act of making a community out of strangers is transformative. We do it because empathy, the engine of all theatre, is a radical act. We do it because experiences are more profound and lasting than any products we might purchase. We do it because the world needs more art, and more love, and more connection.  </p>
<p>I don't know if it's going to work. I never know. I'm going to try it anyway.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Maybe you don't have any money, but you have deep love in your heart for me and my work. Here's how you can help me, even without cash:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Help me get the word out!</strong> Share, share, share. Indigogo has all these helpful Share tools to make it easy. The more people know about my campaign, the greater the chance I won't have to max out my credit cards.</li>
<li>
<strong>Do you know anybody in Edinburgh?</strong> Do you think they'd mind if a group of polite Midwesterners stayed at their house for a few weeks?</li>
<li>
<strong>Do you have any frequent flyer miles? </strong>Maybe they're just sitting there in your account, gathering dust. </li>
<li>
<strong>Tell people about the show in general! </strong>Send them to my show's website <a href=""http://www.ladymacbethshow.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LadyMacbethShow.com</a> for more details.</li>

Fewer than twenty of the many children who had participated in Brundibár survived the war.After the death of Krása and the liberation of the camp, the opera fell out of sight until 1986, when it was performed for Radio Prague. World interest was sparked, and Brundibár has had a slow but steady recognition by opera enthusiasts. The voices of Ojai Youth Opera now echo the message of Brundibár, one of hope, that has touched countless audiences all over the world for the past seventy years. Since its inception in 2012, Ojai Youth Opera, OYO as we affectionately call it, has been providing opera education outreach programs to the youth of Ventura and Santa Barbara counties while enriching the cultural landscape of these communities and beyond.We are committed to creating opportunities for children to discover opera, fostering transformative outreach and education about the operatic arts and encouraging its growth through our distinct Ojai educational programs, workshops, and camps.As the first stand-alone children’s opera company in the United States, OYO is also developing a replicable model for budding youth opera programs in other parts of the country to follow. Andrew Petracca, age 24, is a vocalist and multi-instrumentalist. He has been singing professionally since he was 8 years old, touring America and the world as a soloist and section leader in the All-American Boys Chorus for 6 years. In high school he pursued extensive piano and vocal studies, singing in Opera Pacific's opera camp for 2 years and participating as a pianist at the International Institute for Young Musicians. He was given the privilege in 2007 to play the villain in the American debut of the opera ""The Star Child"" by German composer Hans-Andre Stamm. He studied piano performance at the University of Kansas, and also at Fullerton college where he began to acquaint himself more deeply with jazz music. He is a guest artist/faculty member of the Ojai Youth Opera company, and will play  Vodnik in Rusalka at the Vivace opera workshop in Vancouver this August. He currently lives in Camarillo, where he makes music full time.  Kaylie Turner was born in Ojai, California. She is a student at Villanova Preparatory School, but will be attending Nordhoff High School as a junior next year. Kaylie began playing the violin at age six and started voice lessons at the age of 12. She has been focusing on voice ever since. She attended Interlochen Center of the Arts Summer Camp for violin in 2013 and 2015. Kaylie will be returning to Interlochen again this summer for their high school vocal artist program. This past summer she was a part of Idyllwild Arts Academy’s Festival Choir.

$1,600 to stage Evolutions Purpose at the Deep River
Town Hall Historic Theater.  These funds supported the rental of rehearsal
space, rental of the theater, lighting design, and wardrobe.  The
premiere was a success and RVDP is ready to take it to the next stage.



Our collaboration with Regional Productions is
going to be amazing.   We are making a 30-minute film that combines modern
music and modern dance.  We are working with film to give viewers an
interesting and engaging performance through multiple perspectives that would
otherwise be lost.                         - Linalynn Schmelzer
   Why We Need $5,000


High quality film equipment
Film production crew
Rehearsal and performance space
Dancers
Lighting design
Costumes
Musical copyrights

<p>Welcome to North Atlantic Dance Theatre's Scheherazade!!<br/></p> <p>I am the director of NADT , Lucy. We are asking for your help to get our original production of Scheherazade up and running. Now your probably asking yourself who, what and why, right?</p>
<p> The who:</p>
<p>North Atlantic Dance Theatre (formerly associated with North Atlantic 
Ballet) is a vibrant Boston based dance company creating  and recreating
 new and original works. Our collaborations with Dancers, 
Choreographers, Musicians, Visual Artists and Community keeps our art 
form fresh; invigorating our audiences with a new experience in the 
ballet world. We create and recreate innovative performances which inspire audiences 
to give themselves over to our world for a short time.</p>
<p>check out our <a href=""https://northatlanticdancetheatre.squarespace.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">WEBSITE</a><br/></p>
<p>I am the director of the company forming it in 2014 at the demand for more quality ballet in Boston. Formerly a freelance performance artist in and around the Boston area I am excited and eager to show this company's chops off. NADT separates itself from the rest in its originality and integrity within its creations. This company brings a fresh approach to an age old art form. We are intense in our passion for what we love but work in a relaxed environment, usually filled with raucous laughter, with dedicated professionals.<br/></p>The what:<br/><br/> Our newest  production of Scheherazade is an original work. Unlike the typical staged productions set by companies the world over, we have chosen to focus on the actual arrival of Scheherazade and her journey as a woman overcoming her obstacles.  Based on the stories from 1001 Arabian nights, this production includes an anime prologue by Giorgi Shanidze, live instrumentation, Choreography by me and elaborate costuming by Li-Ann Lim.<br/><p>                              <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1422308/files/20150428090015-Liann_close_up.png?1430236815"" src="""" style=""width: 372.162px; height: 170px;""/></p>This is what we are saying about it:<br/>
<p>A mystical tale of passion, betrayal and love’s conquests.
Scheherazade’s struggle for her survival depends on her skill in storytelling
and keeping the sultan enthralled night after night for A 1001 Arabian Nights.
Unlike most staged productions this story begins where most end.<span>  Scheherazade, our heroine, vows to save
the lives of all the women in her city from the the vengeful hands of the Sultan, Shahryar. Sheherazade offers up her life in marriage to the sultan in
hopes that her story telling will keep her alive long enough to break through
the Sultans calloused heart and renew his ability to love once more. Filled with stories of genies, princesses, and the seductive ladies of baghdad. This is an
empowering tale of women; their mysteries and willingness to sacrifice for what they believe in.</span></p>
<p><span>The why:<br/></span></p>
<p><span>This is a story that lasts throughout the ages. A woman's journey is never over and this ballet empowers women in their strength in love, ability for compassion, and forgiveness. Help us tell or rather dance this story!</span></p>
<p><span>Your donation can help us put this great ballet together and empower women through the gift of dance. One more small step for women.<br/></span></p>
</div> <div> <h3>This is what we need:</h3>
<p>All donations will go towards making this ballet happen and spreading the word. <br/></p>
<p>We need:</p>
<p> $1800 for the Plaza Theatre (fee of $650 + 10%  has already been paid)<br/></p>
<p>$600 for our lighting designer</p>
<p>$1200 for dancers</p>
<p>$500 for the anime artist</p>
<p>Of course there are other costs but these are the ones we need help with the most. We have  a hold on the theater already but as a new company we still need some help.</p>
<p>Stuff you can get for helping out:</p>
<ul>
<li>A personal stage thank you.</li>
<li>Receive a signed photo by the company (below) Photo by Zev Hoover<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1423058/files/20150428115410-li-ann_arabesque_reflection_zev.jpg?1430247250"" src="""" style=""width: 215.649px; height: 144px;""/></p>

<li>A T-shirt with a photo from the company and 2015 season line-up.<br/>
</li>
<li>Attend a rehearsal and give us some input on the creation of the ballet.</li>
<li>Join the company for a private dress rehearsal showing with a tour backstage and chat with the dancers and choreographer.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the case we don't make our goal the funds will be used for later purposes. We will try again but we will most likely have to down-size our production and possibly delay it. Which will stink but we will perform this ballet it is worth the wait if we have too.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Your Impact</h3>
<p>Most dance companies rely on supporters such as family, friends and fans. About 70%-80% of a company's budget comes from these supporters. So your donation matters to us. We value and appreciate every penny that comes our way and understand that the quality of what we produce needs to match your dollar.</p>
<p>Without your donation this powerful story stays silent. The story of Scheherazade is about one of the strongest literary female leads in the world.  Her story can be passed down just as other women's stories have been, fictional or not. Scheherazade can be listed among powerful women such as Joan d'Arc, Jane Eyre, Hester Prynne, even Hermione Granger! Help her voice be heard through dance.</p>
<p>Our last performance was raised through Indiegogo also. Thanks to supporters like you we managed to collaborate with a production crew to integrate live video into a production of Vivaldi's Four Seasons. It was a thrilling show and experience for the dancers. It was our premiere performance and a successful one at that. <br/></p> <p></p>
<br/> </div> <div> <h3>Our Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Well mainly if we don't make it now we'll make it later. I'm in this for the long haul and believe that Boston does need this small passionate company. It will take time and patience to build a company from nothing so we expect people to not believe in us until we gain their trust and prove to them that we are truly a great company and are an important part of the Boston dance scene. <br/></p>
<p>Those of our fans whose hearts we have won over, Thank you for taking a chance on us. <br/></p> <ul></ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p> Can't donate but still want to help?</p>

<blockquote style=""font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;"">They say any artist paying six dollars may exhibit.<br/>Mr. Richard Mutt sent in a fountain. Without discussion this article disappeared and was never exhibited.<br/>What were the grounds for refusing Mr. Mutt's fountain:<br/>        1. Some contend it was immoral, vulgar. <br/>        2. Others, it was plagiarism, a plain piece of plumbing.<br/>Now Mr. Mutt's fountain is not immoral, that is absurd, no more than a bath tub is immoral. It is a fixture that you see every day in plumbers' show windows.<br/>Whether Mr. Mutt with his own hands made the fountain or not has no importance. He CHOSE it. He took an ordinary article of life, placed it so that its useful significance disappeared under a new title and point of view – created a new thought for that object.<br/>As for plumbing, that is absurd.

<h3>The Play</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>The first scenes were drafted by
Ionesco after trying to learn English
from the Assimil method called
English Without Toil. In the ready-
made phrases aligned one after the other he saw an inconsistency in language which became the
inspiration for his play. From the
beginning, this admirer of Lewis
Carroll and other surrealists, knew
he wanted to make his play a parody
of theatre. </p>

</h3>
<div>
<h3></h3>
<p><b>What Ionesco called ‘The Tragedy of Language’ more than half a century ago is still relevant today</b>. The abuse of language through vast quantities of information, the impossibility to process the infinite number of messages thrown to us by the ‘society of information’. Social Media, express journalism (The Huffington Post model of cheap and quick news) makes it even more difficult to separate what piece of information is important and what’s not. At the same time, today’s instant messaging and other ‘communication’ tools connect us with practically everyone around the globe instantly and all this 'progress' has not yet solved the most basic human problem: <b>We still can't understand each other</b>.</p>
<p>This is why we think this play must be presented again, with energy and passion, to as much people as possible.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>

<p><i>“The play is an attack against what
Ionesco has called the universal petty-
bourgeoisie ...the personification of
accepted ideas and slogans, the ubiquitous
conformist.The acceptance of ready-made
ideas by the masses turn our societies into
collections of centrally directed automata”

</div></div>","Anonymous article in The Blind Man # 2, May 1917. 
Written by Beatrice Wood, H.P. Roché and/or Marcel Duchamp.
The Richard Mutt Case
They say any artist paying six dollars may exhibit.Mr. Richard Mutt sent in a fountain. Without discussion this article disappeared and was never exhibited.What were the grounds for refusing Mr. Mutt's fountain:        1. Some contend it was immoral, vulgar.         2. Others, it was plagiarism, a plain piece of plumbing.Now Mr. Mutt's fountain is not immoral, that is absurd, no more than a bath tub is immoral. It is a fixture that you see every day in plumbers' show windows.Whether Mr. Mutt with his own hands made the fountain or not has no importance. He CHOSE it. He took an ordinary article of life, placed it so that its useful significance disappeared under a new title and point of view – created a new thought for that object.As for plumbing, that is absurd. The only works of art America has given are her plumbing and her bridges. 

Founded in 2013 for the production of the film Seep, The R.Mutt Society is a multidisciplinary company based in New York City. Our name and logo comes from Duchamp’s ‘Fountain.’ As the renowned scholar Martin Esslin says in his landmark work The Theatre of the Absurd: “We believe that every work of art must be a statement. It must be a statement addressed in the first person singular to the first person plural, and the latter must retain the right to dissent.”

The Play 





The first scenes were drafted by
Ionesco after trying to learn English
from the Assimil method called
English Without Toil. In the ready-
made phrases aligned one after the other he saw an inconsistency in language which became the
inspiration for his play. From the
beginning, this admirer of Lewis
Carroll and other surrealists, knew
he wanted to make his play a parody
of theatre. 










The Impact



What Ionesco called ‘The Tragedy of Language’ more than half a century ago is still relevant today. The abuse of language through vast quantities of information, the impossibility to process the infinite number of messages thrown to us by the ‘society of information’. Social Media, express journalism (The Huffington Post model of cheap and quick news) makes it even more difficult to separate what piece of information is important and what’s not. At the same time, today’s instant messaging and other ‘communication’ tools connect us with practically everyone around the globe instantly and all this 'progress' has not yet solved the most basic human problem: We still can't understand each other.
This is why we think this play must be presented again, with energy and passion, to as much people as possible.






“The play is an attack against what
Ionesco has called the universal petty-
bourgeoisie ...the personification of
accepted ideas and slogans, the ubiquitous
conformist.The acceptance of ready-made
ideas by the masses turn our societies into
collections of centrally directed automata”

―Martin Esslin.The Theatre of the Absurd.

<p>Indy Convergence is a non-profit arts organization that hosts pop-up artist residencies in Indianapolis, at York University and at the Sa-K-La-K-Wel Community center in Oban, Haiti. </p>
<p>Indy Convergence provides opportunity to artists getting their ideas off the ground. We provide <b>space, material and human resources</b> for artists to work on projects they've been imagining, but haven't had the time or space to explore.  In past years we've had scripts read aloud for the first time, choreographers finally put a missing section into a larger piece of work, puppeteers create that huge puppet they've always wanted to try making. </p>
<p>Indy Convergence provides opportunities for artists to share and learn. Each participating artist <b>teaches a class</b> that is open to the community for free or trade. Being an artist isn't just about creating, but also the ability to talk about your art work and share it with your community.</p>
<p>Indy Convergence provides opportunities for collaboration. We bring together artists from all over (primarily North America), in all disciplines, of all types. We provide <b>new eyes and ways of understanding</b> for the artists who've come to work... but having other artists work with them. <br/></p>
<p>Indy Convergence provides a challenging work environment. We push the artists that join us, and they push each other, to <b>do more and go farther</b> with their ideas than they ever though possible. <br/></p>

<p><b>MATERIALS</b></p>
<p>We provide all of our participating artists with the supplies they need to take their work to the next level. That can be printed scripts, puppet building materials, a special lighting instrument or lumber for a large prop. We also require materials to support our community workshops. On average we host 9 workshops that cost us $100 each. Artists are creative, resourceful and inventive. However, sometimes you just need that ""thing"" to make the magic happen. This year, we'll also need specialty lighting instruments for <a href=""http://www.indyconvergence.org/2015/01/ian-directs-the-umbrella-project/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this year's Umbrella Project</a> (led by our incredible designer and do-it-all man <a href=""http://www.toasterlab.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ian Garrett</a>).</p>

<ul>
</ul>
<div>I'm Daniel Llewelyn-Williams. I come from a long line of dockers and policemen in the industrial port town of Newport... and I'm an actor.. and a writer. I have a passion to make theatre that's accessible to a non theatre audience but not necessarily by writing solely for any one group or celebrating popular culture just to get ""down with the kids"". I have a passion for local history and for acknowledging the less glamorous human stories of tenacity and compassion which become lost when we cease to immortalise them in story and song.</div>
<div>I need support to realise my ambitions for my stage play, A Regular Little Houdini, to put it in front of an audience in Hollywood and across California to charm them with the story of a working class Edwardian boy who defies his destiny and, despite his desperate surroundings, maintains his positivity and the lustre of his burning desire to break the mould and become a stage magician, despite the industrial grind which consumes every one around him. </div>
<div>When we booked this showcase tour of USA and UK, we had funding in place which since, has sadly fallen through. We are seeking crowd funding to ensure the American tour is a success. Our mission is to put this play in front of people who could help realise our dream of turning this successful stage show into a successful feature film, immortalising the human themes in the piece and the lesser known history of a former industrial town which, for two generations has bred despondency and a lack of ambition in it's youth.</div>
</div><div>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get.</h3>
<div></div>
<p>In lieu of our lost funding, we aim to raise at least £2000 to augment the marketing and advertising budget (a crucial factor in pulling crowds for theatre) whilst touring America and Edinburgh Fringe, affording us the opportunity to promote this show to an audience of influential people. We are taking the show to the Hollywood Fringe Festival, the San Diego Fringe Festival and the Headwaters Theatre in Oregon, and then we take it to the Pleasance at the Edinburgh Fringe. Fliers, posters, online ads, sponsored editorials, interviews, reviews, advertising in local and national publications, radio slots. The more support we have, the more we can commit to marketing and the more we will get back in terms of exposure to audience and to professional parties.</p>
<div>There are a range of perks, stretching from, ""your name in the book"", the published script, as a supporter of the cause; signed programs; a weekend  away for 2 in a luxury 2 bed flat and a guided tour of the Newport Transporter bridge and the landmarks within the show by the writer; ""named character""; your name immortalised in the script as a secondary character. Please see the ""perks section"" for more options.</div>
<div>If we don't reach our goal, what money which has been kindly pledged will be used to great effect in the sliding scale of the marketing beast. This is a hungry monster and will consume everything you put into it... but... the more we put in, the more positive the effect on the audience figures. Anything we put into this fund will be better than nothing. We are hoping for £2000 but a figure less than that will be gratefully received and considerately utilised.</div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>To make this story an international success would have social repercussions on the disenfranchised generation within Newport, the subject of the play, by making their history, the story of the very land on which they stand, relevant in a wider world; the consequences of which, we hope, would inspire young people, like my son and daughter, who have grown up in what they might perceive as a ""no hope dive"", to believe that positive futures can be made in a post-industrial environment, where jobs are like gold-dust; that pride in, and knowledge of, one's very history is what makes us who we are; that we are the result of millions of generations of success stories, and that natural selection has deemed us ""all"" to be relevant.  </div><div>I create theatre about human issues, about the human condition, about what it is to struggle and still to thrive in this short life and yet to care. <br/>
</div><div>I've won several awards and am an associate of Theatr Clwyd. I am currently developing a new script about the Chartist uprising of 1839 called ""The Chartists and the Lament of George Shell"". Please check out my theatre company website <a href=""http://www.flyingbridgetheatre.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.flyingbridgetheatre.co.uk</a>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The risk is that we take this show to Hollywood, to San Diego, to Edinburgh and beyond and for all the effort and expense of touring a show internationally, we fall at the last hurdle and fail to commit a satisfactory marketing budget.

<p>Our challenge is to overcome this, by firstly raising a marketing budget from nothing. Secondly to be economical and practical with our marketing opportunities.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <p>My name is Lorraine Chapman and along with Joan Talarico-Brodsky we are thrilled to introduce to you the <i>Shaker Dance Revival Project.</i> I am the Resident DanceMaker and Joan is the Dance Revivalist of this new strategic program at Canterbury Shaker Village. The <i>SDRP</i> honors Shaker dance while rethinking tradition for contemporary audiences and dancers. Both Joan and I share a passion for movement commensurable with the Shakers. Like the Shakers we believe that movement connects both dancers and non-dancers to an essential aspect of what makes us human.</p>
<p>My background in dance spans 42 years of training, commitment, dedication, performing, teaching and creating. The dance world is where I chose to reside many years ago. It is my home and movement is my faith. When I dance I understand my purpose and I feel that things are harmoniously in order. The power of moving tunes me into the simplicity of the present moment and the simplicity of moving tunes me into the power of the present moment. It is in these ways that I understand the Shaker way of life. </p>
<p>For Joan dance has always been a part of her life. The impulse to move to music was there from the very beginning. From childhood on, dancing has been a need and one that she built into a career as a teacher, performer and finally, a movement therapist. She believes that dance is intrinsic to all world cultures because it's innate to the human condition and creates a universal language.  The Shakers also had a need to express themselves through dance which was the foundation of their community worship. </p>
<p>The <i>SDRP</i> was birthed from Joan's desire to bring dance back to Canterbury Shaker Village. In her search for an artistic programmer, she discovered me and with the Village's Executive Director Funi Burdick's blessing we have been going non-stop since December 2015! </p>
<p>For our first endeavor we coordinated and organized the <i>SDRP's</i> inaugural summer dance intensive which took place in the Village's iconic Meeting House on both June 22-24 and June 27-29 with our first artists residencies on June 25 &amp; 26. We had a total of 24 enthusiastic and talented participants that were a joy to work with, and 19 of New England's most preeminent, knowledgeable and inspiring dance educators teaching their classes. The Meeting House had not experienced dancing inside of it's walls, erected in 1792, for close to 100 years. The significance of dancing inside these walls again was palpable, with a few people even experiencing ""chills"". The participants took contemporary technique classes in a variety of dance styles including ballet, jazz, modern, post modern, Pilates, Yoga, dance making, partnering, core strength &amp; deep release, free writing &amp; improvisation, hip-hop, Isadora Duncan technique, classical ballet variations, and the repertory of Skybetter &amp; Associates and Prometheus Dance.  </p>

<p><i>""It was an honor and so much fun to teach the first dance
class in the CSV Meeting House.  What a
wonderful experience to see our students reflecting the spirit of the
Shakers.  I would love to see this
program grow so that others can experience this unparalleled location and
opportunities to dance, to connect with other dancers and artists, and to experience
the healing aspects of movement.""</i> - Danielle Zecker-Hannon, MA, DTR, (Integrated Pilates,
Modern/Contemporary &amp; Yoga Class)</p>
<p>Next on the <i>SDRP</i> agenda, we curated and produced our inaugural performances! On August 5th, we presented ""RELEASED"" which featured works by outstanding choreographers including the premiere of a new collaborative work inspired by original Shaker dances. This original piece, co-created by choreographers David Parker, a Guggenheim Fellow, and myself, a Dance Magazine “25 To Watch,” was performed by our award-winning companies The Bang Group and LCTC.</p>
<p>“RELEASED” also featured works by the ineffable Diane Arvanites; Boston treasure Marcus Schulkind; and Doppelgänger Dance Collective–comprised of Shura Baryshnikov and Danielle Davidson–who performed a duet titled “The Two Body Problem” by internationally known technologist, choreographer, and writer Sydney Skybetter. The program concluded with an excerpt from “Brilliant Being,” a devised work using dance and technology evolving synchronously through collaboration with a team of artists/faculty members from the Music, Theatre, and Dance Departments at Plymouth State University, including NH-based choreographer Amanda Whitworth of Tributary Dance NH; projection mapper, scenographer, and technologist Matt Kizer; playwrite Paul Mroczka and composer Jonathan Santore.</p>
<p>On August 6th as part of Village Rising - A day of exploration, inspiration and creativity - was ”RISING &amp; ROTATING,” performances by emerging companies, choreographers and student groups as well as established dance artists including Sarah Duclos/Neoteric Dance Collaborative, Mariah Rasmussen, Grant Jacoby, Amanda Hinchey, Jessica Howard, Emily Jerant-Hendrickson, Wisty Andres, Shriya Srinivasan, Julien Heller, and Ballet Misha. “RISING &amp; ROTATING” will include “Hearth” a film and dance installation by Emily Beattie in the North Shop. Hearth is an immersive installation that uses black and white film and dance to invoke the creative spirit in daily tasks.</p> Organized and expressive movement is deeply rooted in our rich, cultural past and is such an integral part of our humanity. We will be (and are already) creating a thriving dance environment at the Village which will reinvigorate the Shaker tradition of dance through:</div><div>
<p>1.<b>Performance</b> – creation and presentation of
inter&amp;multi disciplinary, professional and pre-professional works featuring

performance introductions and Q&amp;A’s </p>
<p>Joan and I believe that dance can once again secure a renewed contemporary community at Canterbury Shaker Village. We are also hoping that the <i>SDRP</i> will increase visitors, memberships and funding opportunities for the Village. There is a significance that Canterbury Shaker Village holds for visitors beyond dance. The Village offers all of us a rare glimpse into a completely intact living commonality. The Shakers embodied a way of life that valued service to something higher than themselves. Simplicity and peace bred ingenuity, entrepreneurial excellence, equality and enormous kindness. The Shakers exhibited a rare breed of decency and respect for all and stewarded the land with care. The <i>SDRP</i> is striving to invigorate a robust dance environment in New Hampshire and to expose and inspire the general public to a utopian lifestyle from which our contemporary life has much to learn.</p>

</div></div>","My name is Lorraine Chapman and along with Joan Talarico-Brodsky we are thrilled to introduce to you the Shaker Dance Revival Project. I am the Resident DanceMaker and Joan is the Dance Revivalist of this new strategic program at Canterbury Shaker Village. The SDRP honors Shaker dance while rethinking tradition for contemporary audiences and dancers. Both Joan and I share a passion for movement commensurable with the Shakers. Like the Shakers we believe that movement connects both dancers and non-dancers to an essential aspect of what makes us human.
My background in dance spans 42 years of training, commitment, dedication, performing, teaching and creating. The dance world is where I chose to reside many years ago. It is my home and movement is my faith. When I dance I understand my purpose and I feel that things are harmoniously in order. The power of moving tunes me into the simplicity of the present moment and the simplicity of moving tunes me into the power of the present moment. It is in these ways that I understand the Shaker way of life. 
For Joan dance has always been a part of her life. The impulse to move to music was there from the very beginning. From childhood on, dancing has been a need and one that she built into a career as a teacher, performer and finally, a movement therapist. She believes that dance is intrinsic to all world cultures because it's innate to the human condition and creates a universal language.  The Shakers also had a need to express themselves through dance which was the foundation of their community worship. 
The SDRP was birthed from Joan's desire to bring dance back to Canterbury Shaker Village. In her search for an artistic programmer, she discovered me and with the Village's Executive Director Funi Burdick's blessing we have been going non-stop since December 2015! 
For our first endeavor we coordinated and organized the SDRP's inaugural summer dance intensive which took place in the Village's iconic Meeting House on both June 22-24 and June 27-29 with our first artists residencies on June 25 & 26. We had a total of 24 enthusiastic and talented participants that were a joy to work with, and 19 of New England's most preeminent, knowledgeable and inspiring dance educators teaching their classes. The Meeting House had not experienced dancing inside of it's walls, erected in 1792, for close to 100 years. The significance of dancing inside these walls again was palpable, with a few people even experiencing ""chills"". The participants took contemporary technique classes in a variety of dance styles including ballet, jazz, modern, post modern, Pilates, Yoga, dance making, partnering, core strength & deep release, free writing & improvisation, hip-hop, Isadora Duncan technique, classical ballet variations, and the repertory of Skybetter & Associates and Prometheus Dance.  


""It was an honor and so much fun to teach the first dance
class in the CSV Meeting House.  What a
wonderful experience to see our students reflecting the spirit of the
Shakers.  I would love to see this
program grow so that others can experience this unparalleled location and
opportunities to dance, to connect with other dancers and artists, and to experience
the healing aspects of movement."" - Danielle Zecker-Hannon, MA, DTR, (Integrated Pilates,
Modern/Contemporary & Yoga Class)
Next on the SDRP agenda, we curated and produced our inaugural performances! On August 5th, we presented ""RELEASED"" which featured works by outstanding choreographers including the premiere of a new collaborative work inspired by original Shaker dances. This original piece, co-created by choreographers David Parker, a Guggenheim Fellow, and myself, a Dance Magazine “25 To Watch,” was performed by our award-winning companies The Bang Group and LCTC.

1.Performance – creation and presentation of
inter&multi disciplinary, professional and pre-professional works featuring
both established choreographers and dance companies and emerging choreographers
and student groups  
2.Dance education – summer dance intensive for
pre-professional dancers and individual classes, workshops, community involvement and out-reach activities for all levels,

3.Therapeutic movement - Whole Person Pilates,

4.Audience building and appreciation – experiential workshops, talks,
conversations, video presentations, live demonstrations and lectures about the
art of dance, movement and physical expression as well as both pre&post

<h3>Give A Little, Get A Lot </h3>
<p>With this campaign we're working to raise an additional $7,000.00 to increase the artistic experience of our current ""Juliet Among the Changelings"" production, which opens on August 12th, 2016. We have already received grants from the Miami Dade County Department of Cultural Affairs and the Coral Gables Foundation, and through their generosity we're making sure our cast and crew receive the compensation they more than deserve. Your contributions will go directly to helping us execute beautiful set, lighting, and sound design. All culminating in a theatrical experience unlike anything you've experienced before. Not to give too much away, but...okay, just a hint... PUPPETS!</p>
<p>Lost Girls is a theatre of personality and fun, and as such we've created a collection of unique perks named for the famous changelings of classical and pop culture. Whether you consider yourself more of an elegant Titania, a loyal Dobby, or an ever optimistic Abby, check out our perks section to see what you can expect in exchange for your contribution. Every contribution you make is tax deductible, and every donation means the world to us. There is no donation too small!</p>
<p>So what happens if we don't meet our $7,000.00 goal? Good question. As this is a flexible funding campaign and we are a 501(c)(3) Non-Profit organization, all of your donations will come to Lost Girls Theatre. Every penny will go either to improving the artistic quality of ""Juliet Among the Changelings"" or aiding the Lost Girls team in our mission to develop future projects that seek to expand both the content and visual language necessary for theatre to reach new, diverse audiences for years to come.</p>

<h3>Looking to the Future </h3>
<p>Theatre is, at its heart, about creating a community. This is Lost Girls' first full production, but we've already been hard at work creating a space where those who think of themselves as artists and non-artists alike can share unique ideas, content, and design. For the past two years we've been hosting the ""Getting Lost"" play reading series at South Miami's Deering Estate to give playwrights from diverse backgrounds with new, creative approaches a platform to show and get feedback on their work. </p>
<p>Our company is made up of a diverse mix of people and personalities, and we know that every member of the Lost Girls community brings valuable insights and ideas. As we grow, our goal is to reach out beyond the scope of just theatrical production into community education and development. Exposing theatre to audiences that may currently find themselves under represented or under served, and building the theatre patrons of tomorrow.</p>
<p>But it all starts here. With your help our vision for ""Juliet Among the Changelings"" can get the support it needs to be produced to it's fullest potential. Come join our Lost Girls family and help us create the future of American theatre.</p>

Your contributions will go directly to helping us execute beautiful set, lighting, and sound design. All culminating in a theatrical experience unlike anything you've experienced before. Not to give too much away, but...okay, just a hint... PUPPETS!
Lost Girls is a theatre of personality and fun, and as such we've created a collection of unique perks named for the famous changelings of classical and pop culture. Whether you consider yourself more of an elegant Titania, a loyal Dobby, or an ever optimistic Abby, check out our perks section to see what you can expect in exchange for your contribution. Every contribution you make is tax deductible, and every donation means the world to us. There is no donation too small!
So what happens if we don't meet our $7,000.00 goal? Good question. As this is a flexible funding campaign and we are a 501(c)(3) Non-Profit organization, all of your donations will come to Lost Girls Theatre. Every penny will go either to improving the artistic quality of ""Juliet Among the Changelings"" or aiding the Lost Girls team in our mission to develop future projects that seek to expand both the content and visual language necessary for theatre to reach new, diverse audiences for years to come.
    

Looking to the Future 
Theatre is, at its heart, about creating a community. This is Lost Girls' first full production, but we've already been hard at work creating a space where those who think of themselves as artists and non-artists alike can share unique ideas, content, and design. For the past two years we've been hosting the ""Getting Lost"" play reading series at South Miami's Deering Estate to give playwrights from diverse backgrounds with new, creative approaches a platform to show and get feedback on their work. 
Our company is made up of a diverse mix of people and personalities, and we know that every member of the Lost Girls community brings valuable insights and ideas. As we grow, our goal is to reach out beyond the scope of just theatrical production into community education and development. Exposing theatre to audiences that may currently find themselves under represented or under served, and building the theatre patrons of tomorrow.
But it all starts here. With your help our vision for ""Juliet Among the Changelings"" can get the support it needs to be produced to it's fullest potential. Come join our Lost Girls family and help us create the future of American theatre.

<p>This November, we had planned to bring a wonderful new piece of theatre to town.  ""Detroit"" by Lisa D'Amour is a Pulitzer Prize-nominated play in which two couples who live in adjacent houses awkwardly try to get to know each other. This hilarious and unnerving play operates with a delicious sarcastic humour that reflects an unpleasant but graphic picture of the new struggling class.

<p>Well, for some reason, the public funding bodies didn't think so.  Shockingly, after all of our success, we received no grant funds this year from our annual applications, and so don't have the pivotal cornerstone funding needed to stage this ambitious production.  We're taking action to challenge the ways your tax dollars are spent on arts funding, but that story is for another time.</p>
<p>We recently announced cancellation of ""Detroit"" due to the funding issue and were overwhelmed by the avalanche of response from our audience members, colleagues and supporters.  So many people wrote to us and encouraged us not to cancel the show, pledging assistance and support.  Those who know this play pleaded with us to find a way to give it life despite the lack of public funds.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>We are Seoul Shakespeare Company, an all-volunteer theatre company, and Seoul’s only English-language Shakespeare company. Since 2011 we have been bringing together members of the Seoul theatrical and artistic community to perform an annual major Shakespeare production for audiences in Korea--both expat and Korean.  Last year's production, Titus Andronicus, was a huge stepping stone for our company, bringing a new degree of sophistication to our productions, but because of Korea's MERS panic, which hit exactly during the run of our show, our ticket sales were not enough to start financing this year's production of Much Ado About Nothing, so we are continuing our tradition of an annual crowdfunding campaign, asking our supporters to again be a part of our next production and show their love for the theatre community in Seoul.</p>
<p>This year's production, Much Ado About Nothing, goes in a brand new direction for our company.  In our tradition of alternating between tragedy and comedy, we are swinging the pendulum in the opposite direction from the dark, technically complex Titus of last year to bring audiences a lively, warm, fast-paced, playful experience, with a design and style reminiscent of Elizabethan stage practice. </p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Putting on a piece of theatre is always expensive!  In this campaign, we are asking for a small portion of the total cost of the show.  The total budget for this show is approximately $16,000, about three-quarters of which is just for the theatre rental.  Other costs include rehearsal space rental, printing, fabric for costumes, materials for our minimal set, and a small number of props.  What we don't raise through this campaign we hope to earn through hosting small events and through ticket sales, If you can help us fund this show, we will be very grateful, and to show our appreciations we will credit you in our programs, on our website and Facebook page, and on our video of the production.  To our higher-level donors, we will also send perks such as signed posters and programs, a DVD, and personalized video performances of Shakespeare's sonnets.  Check out our perks list for all the perks we are offering.  No matter how little you can give, you will have our deep appreciation. </p>
<p>Many of us involved in this show have friends and family abroad, and this campaign is also a way that our loved ones can support us and be a part of our artistic endeavors. Whether we know you personally or not, you will have our love and gratitude.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>(Please note that on Indiegogo making a contribution does not automatically sign you up to receive a perk.  If you would like to receive a perk, you must specifically click on the perk you would like to receive.)</p>

</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Even if you can't give directly to our production, you can help us by sharing our campaign through social media, and, if you're in Korea, coming to our show!  Ticket reservations for the show are already available: <a href=""http://www.seoulshakespearecompany.org/much-ado-about-nothing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.seoulshakespearecompany.org/much-ado...</a>  </p>
<p>If you have a Korean bank account, you can also contribute via bank transfer.  Your contribution won't show up in our Indiegogo total, but we can still send you the perks listed above.  Send us an email to let us know that you've contributed, and we can add you to our list of donors.  Here is a link to our bank information: <a href=""http://www.seoulshakespearecompany.org/make-a-contribution"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.seoulshakespearecompany.org/make-a-c...</a><br/></p>

   What We Need & What You Get Putting on a piece of theatre is always expensive!  In this campaign, we are asking for a small portion of the total cost of the show.  The total budget for this show is approximately $16,000, about three-quarters of which is just for the theatre rental.  Other costs include rehearsal space rental, printing, fabric for costumes, materials for our minimal set, and a small number of props.  What we don't raise through this campaign we hope to earn through hosting small events and through ticket sales, If you can help us fund this show, we will be very grateful, and to show our appreciations we will credit you in our programs, on our website and Facebook page, and on our video of the production.  To our higher-level donors, we will also send perks such as signed posters and programs, a DVD, and personalized video performances of Shakespeare's sonnets.  Check out our perks list for all the perks we are offering.  No matter how little you can give, you will have our deep appreciation. 
Many of us involved in this show have friends and family abroad, and this campaign is also a way that our loved ones can support us and be a part of our artistic endeavors. Whether we know you personally or not, you will have our love and gratitude.

(Please note that on Indiegogo making a contribution does not automatically sign you up to receive a perk.  If you would like to receive a perk, you must specifically click on the perk you would like to receive.)


    Other Ways You Can Help Even if you can't give directly to our production, you can help us by sharing our campaign through social media, and, if you're in Korea, coming to our show!  Ticket reservations for the show are already available: http://www.seoulshakespearecompany.org/much-ado...  
If you have a Korean bank account, you can also contribute via bank transfer.  Your contribution won't show up in our Indiegogo total, but we can still send you the perks listed above.  Send us an email to let us know that you've contributed, and we can add you to our list of donors.  Here is a link to our bank information: http://www.seoulshakespearecompany.org/make-a-c...

<h3>COURAGE</h3>
<p><strong><i>Courage</i></strong>, NACL Theatre’s latest outdoor performance spectacle, is an ensemble-generated play with a company of 25 performers, conceived and directed by NACL co-founder and Artistic Director, <strong>Tannis Kowalchuk</strong>, with music by <strong>Rima Fand</strong>, text by <strong>Melissa Bell</strong> and <strong>Mark Dunau, </strong>dramaturgy by <strong>Mimi McGurl,</strong> costumes by <strong>Karen Flood</strong>, and a special cameo appearance by film actress <strong>Debra Winger.</strong></p>
<p>The performance is based on Bertolt Brecht’s <i>Mother Courage and Her Children</i>, along with sources including <i>The Runagate Courage</i> by Von Grimmelshausen and <i>Peace</i> by Aristophanes. <i>Courage</i> advocates for compassion and resiliency in a time of crisis, it exercises spectators’ emotional intelligence in its examination of tyranny, injustice, and the true costs of war.<strong><i> </i></strong><i>Courage</i> will have its New York City premiere with three free shows on Governors Island September 22-24, 2017, and<strong> <i>we need your support to get us there.</i></strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>NACL needs to raise  <strong>$15,000</strong> to bring <strong><i>Courage</i></strong><strong> </strong>to New York City. Funds will help NACL pay more than 30 collaborators and provide housing and sustenance for everybody on the team. We must transport all our costumes, props, and sets in many vehicles to the island and since we are doubling our seating capacity in New York City, we must build a new tent system for the final scenes of the performance. </p>
<h3><strong>What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>Sweet music, T-shirts, posters, tickets, dinner, love...</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p><strong><i>Courage</i></strong> is a timely performance experience. Set in a fictional refugee camp called Camp Renew, the audience is fully immersed in the show’s environment.</p>
<p><strong>What Happens in Courage?</strong> After receiving a visitor’s pass for their camp tour, the audience is introduced to a character played by <strong>Debra Winger </strong>who invokes the spirit of Bertolt Brecht in a prologue to the performance. Before long, the camp visitors (the audience) embark on a tour guided by a merchant woman named Courage and her adopted daughter Kyoko.</p>
<p>Along the way, the audience encounters General Publik and his army of stilt walkers, a smuggler and her newly arrived group of refugees, the preacher, camp musicians, and a professor who presents the visitors of Camp Renew with a tent-production of <i>Peace</i>, by Aristophanes. Throughout, Courage looks for her son Billy who she knows has joined up with the military.</p>
<p><strong>Who's In Courage? </strong> NACL has assembled a remarkable cast of performers who sing, stilt-walk, act, write, and design. The company is made up of performers from the NACL community in upstate New York, New York City, and as far away as Japan and Canada. We are: Writers Melissa Bell and Mark Dunau; Composer Rima Fand; Dramaturg Mimi McGurl; Costume Designer Karen Flood; Actors Jessica Lopez-Barkl, Jessica Beveridge, Michael Chojnicki, Bradley Diuguid, Brett Hughes, Oliver King, Tannis Kowalchuk, Simon Kowalchuk-Swartz, Daniel Lendzian, Nick Lopez, Keith McHenry, John Roth, and Yurika Sase, Debra Winger; Chorus Members Melissa Bell, Tracy Broyles, Rebekah Creshkoff, Rocky Davis, RaeAnn Handshy, Annie Hat, and Nancy Peterman; Stilt Corps Gregg Erickson, Corinna Grunn, Adrianne Picciano, Jon Jon Thomas, Tyler Watts; Musicians Sarah Alden, Zoe Christiansen, and Doug Rogers; Production Management Brad Krumholz and Sue Currier; Stage Management Aubrey Ellis, with Brendan Dromazos; and Technical Direction by Zoot</p>
<h3>Why support <strong><i>Courage</i></strong>?</h3>
<p><strong><i>Courage</i></strong> addresses difficult ideas about justice imbalanced; it evokes situations when war is the first reflex, where people seek refuge from disaster. Through the collaborative efforts of the NACL community, Kowalchuk and the team have built a performance that explores riveting human experiences and situations with beautiful music, heart-wrenching scenes, and plenty of humor in all the right places.</p>
<p>The theatrical experience provided by <i>Courage</i> is an opportunity to see and experience our world today with a new lens, and to help us process not only the news headlines and current events, but  to help decipher our own deeper thoughts and feelings as individuals and communities in times of unrest. <i>Courage</i> can inspire creative and unexpected responses in us all.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>First and foremost, we would like to thank you for visiting and considering donating to our cause. We greatly appreciate it.<br/>We are WreckLess Dance Crew out of Jacksonville, Florida. WreckLess is the adult promotional and competitive team for the company i-Move U-Move dance workshop series. The crew is composed of local dancers and instructors with various training in many genres of dance. Our main style is hip hop. However we can also perform some contemporary modern, modern fusion ( hip hop and contemporary) and ballet. Our mission is to help spread the education of hip hop dance and to uplift, unite and support each other through movement while building relationships and growing into better people every day. </p>
<p>Currently we have been selected to be apart of two competitions where we will represent the USA. The first is the K-pop cover dance festival. We just recently received our bid to the 2nd round of the competition on April 18th. The first round was based off of views and likes of the cover dance video we submitted to the cover dance website. Now the 2nd round will take place April 28th at 6pm at the Source (6940 Beach Blvd Buena Park, CA 90622). This round will be based off our live performance and the judges scores and crowd reaction. As long as we place top 3 we can be selected as finalists in which we will be flown to South Korea to compete in the final round ?@6 30th-June 5th, all expenses paid. Then we will compete for the grand prize and to become the k-pop cover dance champions of the world. We are in need of 7 roundtrip tickets for each member's travel to there and back. We also have a showcase on the 30th so we are flying out Thursday, to compete on Friday and flying back home to prepare for the showcase. If we can do this it will help spread the awareness of Jacksonville Dance Community and talent and it would also strengthen the case of Jacksonville having professional dancers which will inspire a lot of the students here around town. We have also been selected represent America in Croatia called Dance Star. For this competition we will combine with other dance teams from Chicago, Phoenix, and Detroit to represent the nation against the world. Dance Star competition begins May 25th. The plan is to leave the US on May 23rd and return May 29th. In order for us to participate we must raise $2000-$4000 to help cover expenses such as food, stay, flight, team USA paraphernalia and other means of transportation for the entire trip. </p>
<p>These competitions and our successes in them would greatly boost the hype and awareness of the Jacksonville dance community. It would help us with networking as well so we can meet some new dancers and choreographers to bring to Jacksonville to further spread the education aspect of dance. This would benefit the community as a whole because everyone would have someone new to take class and learn from. One of our goals has been to help put Jacksonville​ on the map for the dance scene. The more attention we bring to the city the better it will be for our dance community. We would like to say thank you in advance for helping us reach these major milestones in our dance career as a crew.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need as much support as we can get.  We would like to ask for your support, donations and that you spread the word about our campaign and us as a dance crew in Jacksonville. We have some perks that you may enjoy.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This would greatly affect WreckLess as a crew, as far as our growth and the exposure that we will receive. It would be huge for us mentally as well. These are some experiences that we never imagined could happen to us especially with us being from Jacksonville. It has been so hard for us to get exposure and to book gigs so this is a dream come true for us as a crew. Because of how it will impact us directly it will help with building​ the dance community because we are some of the instructors here in town. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risks and challenges that we have to overcome with this campaign are not making it to the finals of the K-pop cover dance competition, also with our own showcase coming up on the 30th it is a lot to focus on both performances. But the crew is up to the task and we are working very hard to deliver 2 A+ performances, one in LA and the others back home for our showcase. It's exactly the life we want to live and were told we couldn't staying in Jacksonville.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>The more you share the more we grow. So we ask that everyone share the campaign and let someone know that there​ are dancers in Jacksonville working to be the best they can be and bring a demand for professional dancers right here.</p>

</h3> <p>TRUCE is a dramatic love story of self-acceptance, forgiveness but never forgetting. It is a story about a brother who loses his brother to gay teen suicide and bullying. It is a story about HIV stigma in the LGBT community. It is a story about domestic violence from both the abuser point of view and the victim's point of view. It is about family and about who are your real friends in this crazy world.  <br/></p>
<p>Jesse finds out that he has been diagnosed with HIV from his doctor, and needs to tell his boyfriend, Casey. Casey discovers that his younger brother has committed suicide due to bullying and not enough love from the people in his life. Casey plans on proposing to Jesse until he finds out about Jesse's diagnosis and then goes into a blackout domestic violence attack on Jesse. Stormy is Casey's younger sister who is the glue that holds everything together and in the end is the one person who has an intervention with Casey. After leaving Jesse's apartment, Jesse meets Aaron who apparently knew Jesse ten years prior in London under a different name and was also a victim of his domestic violent attacks. Before Casey shows up in the alley, Jesse and Aaron leave the premises to clean up Jesse and start a new life. Meanwhile, Stormy and Casey have an intervention that changes both of their lives forever.<br/></p>

<p><br/>Your help, however great or small, will be invaluable to the development of <i>The Wicker Husband</i>. It's an ambitious project in its combination of forms, styles and practices. By its very nature, Musical Theatre requires huge amounts of dramaturgical and explorative work, and with the inclusion of puppetry, folk music, dance and storytelling, this project demands even more time spent in these early days. <br/><br/>We want this to be a remarkable and innovative theatrical experience, and your help will not only support our project, but set a useful precedent for future collaborators who wish to embark on similar ambitious projects.

The Wicker Husband, a new folk musical



book and story by Rhys Jennings


music and lyrics by Darren Clark

based on an original short story by Ursula Wills-Jones



FINAL WEEK UPDATE: ""The Sparrow's Tale"" as sung by the Tailor's Wife...


The Wicker Husband will be an unconventional musical combining puppetry, folk music and dance to weave the tale of an Ugly Girl and her understanding of the cruel world she lives in. It is the story the Outsider, of self-acceptance in a society that tells us what it is to be ""Ugly"".With permission from Ursula Wills-Jones to adapt her original short story, composer Darren Clark and bookwriter Rhys Jennings have been developing the idea since 2014 with the help of director/dramaturg Charlotte Westenra - and this year we will be conducting a series of three dramaturgical workshops towards a private industry presentation to share the work we have developed.It is set to be an exciting year for us, and we'd love for you to help us on our journey of exploring this exciting new work.



We are applying for Arts Council funding to help us stage a series of three workshops in 2016. For a successful bid, we need to raise 10% of our funding from outside sources, which is why we are asking for YOUR help.Your support will allow us to explore the theatrical world, create and develop new material, engage a puppetry director, collaborate with artists, and eventually stage a full rehearsed reading of the show to pitch for it's future...The first workshop will be a week of exploration with a team of actors and musicians working on the material and structure of Act II. This follows a previous successful workshop at the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama, which focussed on Act I. Funding will provide: venue hire, artist fees and printing costs.The second stage will consist of a series of meetings and collaborations between puppetry experts and basket-makers, a period of design and the creation of a prototype puppet (full scale 'bunraku' man made of wicker) and three days exploration with a team of three puppeteers. Funding will provide: expert consultation fees, workroom hire, material cost, construction time, rehearsal space and performer fees.
The third, and ultimate, goal is to conduct a week's rehearsal of the full production with a team of actors and musicians, culminating in a script-in-hand industry presentation. Funding will provide: venue hire, performer fees, printing costs, an audio recording, a production booklet about The Wicker Husband and provision for the industry presentation...





Your help will make an incredible difference to how quickly we are able to make it to the third stage of development. In return for your help we will offer a number of perks as incentives to donate:
Those who donate any amount, however small, will be added to the Wicker Husband Mailing List keeping you informed of the project's development. This will give a unique insight into creating a material for a new musical and you'll receive updates, pictures and recordings at each stage of the process.



For donations over £5 you will receive a Special Wicker Email. (Indiegogo terms dictate that we cannot mention on this page what it's for!)Visit: http://bit.ly/TheOtherPerks to find out more.


For donations over £15, you will have access to the above PLUS a hand-written card from the Wicker Husband team thanking you for your contribution.


For donations over £25, and once our third stage of development is reached, you will have access to all the above PLUS online access to some audio recordings of Darren Clark's music for The Wicker Husband, a folk musical made during our industry presentation. 


For donations over £50, and once our second stage of development is reached, you will receive all the above PLUS an invitation to see our Wicker Husband puppet in action at the end of our three day exploration. If you are unable to attend (date: TBC) we will organise a separate time for you to meet the puppet in person.


For donations over £75, you will receive all the above PLUS a copy of our production pack, about The Wicker Husband, the journey so far and our plans for the future. These will be limited edition and will be provided to all industry contacts at our private rehearsed reading.


For donations over £100, you will receive all the above PLUS a copy of the first draft script signed by the cast of our rehearsed reading.


If you are feeling incredibly generous and donate anything in excess of £150, you will receive all of the above PLUS an exclusive invitation to our industry reading in 2016 (date: TBC).  



Wherever possible, we will endeavour to mention all those contributors who wish to be named in future publications pertaining to The Wicker Husband, a folk musical. 




Your help, however great or small, will be invaluable to the development of The Wicker Husband. It's an ambitious project in its combination of forms, styles and practices. By its very nature, Musical Theatre requires huge amounts of dramaturgical and explorative work, and with the inclusion of puppetry, folk music, dance and storytelling, this project demands even more time spent in these early days. We want this to be a remarkable and innovative theatrical experience, and your help will not only support our project, but set a useful precedent for future collaborators who wish to embark on similar ambitious projects. For this reason, we have kept all production notes, emails, drafts and so forth, and we hope that in future we can make this information freely available to the public, in particular those practitioners who wish to see how we took a small idea and transformed it into a bold and brave piece of theatre. 





As well as appealing for donations, we are also keen to hear from anyone who can offer any other ""in-kind support"" which will help towards our goal. The monetary worth of some of this support can also be used toward our 10%, which the Arts Council require. This includes, but is not limited to:



Printing costs: help with printing all or some of our written material - drafts, scripts, musical notation, invitations, booklets etc.
Rehearsal venues and workshop space: full provision or reduced rate offers.
Audio/Video recording: our third level of development will include a recording of the rehearsed reading, which will require equipment and technical assistance.
Mentorship and guidance: if you have experience in puppetry, theatre-producing, research and development, grant-application or similar areas of expertise, please get  in touch and see how you can guide us toward our goal.
Design: until the show reaches production stage and we secure a designer, any artists or designers are welcome to get in touch at this stage to help by creating conceptual artwork of puppets, characters and settings.
Materials: donations of puppet materials, willow, withy or similar.
Storage: once our prototype puppet has been made, we will need to find somewhere safe to keep him temporarily when he is not in use. (London)
Press & Publicity: writers and journalists are welcome to talk to the team about the project and help us spread the word.

<p>Storied bodies, mythological bodies, bodies-in-creation, and bodies as manifestos…these are the places from which I have created the works we'll share at Highways. MBDance is characterized by muscles, beads of sweat, and exertion as well as surrender and softness. Our vision of beauty is expansive, and the new pieces chart intimacy and legacy through this lens. </p>
<p>For <i>Attend Me</i>, I was inspired by the writings and philosophy of Audre Lorde--particularly her love poems. With the dancers, I have brought forth <b>a kinetic vision of radical self-acceptance and self-love, romantic love, and defiant love between Black women</b>. Torian Ugworji created beautiful animations for this trio. We've been honored to create and share in-progress versions of ""Attend Me"" through two CUNY Dance Initiative Residencies, and we performed an excerpt from the piece at our beloved BAAD! in New York. The performances we are raising funds for at Highways in Los Angeles will be the first time we've performed the full piece with full lighting, sound, costuming, and animations! May Audre Lorde approve and affirm of how we have been alchemists with her spirit and ours. <br/></p>
<p><i>Limbs</i> is a new piece I created especially for the phenomenal Marina Magalhães. Marina is a lightning bolt of a performer, quickening and slowing the pulse of audience members as she chooses, with her deft uses of nuance and passion. With an elegant set created by Julio Sims, I created a solo inspired by the swooping and braided branches of ancient trees I researched in Richmond, VA. This piece invites us to consider <b>""What is the legacy of our natural world? Where and how have we secreted away space within us to appreciate the sacred beauty of nature?"" and ""What does it mean to be old?"" </b></p>
<p>I will also dance a structured improvisation from my <i>grace is high and low</i> series. Folks in L.A. will experience versions 5 and 6, after performances at WOW Cafe Theatre, BAAD!, and the American Dance Festival. As I deepen my own study of our bodies' inherent value and compelling nature, this work becomes more and more rich. </p>
<p>MBDance frequently performs on shared bills and at festivals. We have only had full evenings of our own work at Dogtown Dance in Richmond, VA--and now at Highways Performance Space in Los Angeles! Over the past two years, I have devoted more time to my art, researched and studied voraciously, and been blessed to have artistic mentorship from giants like Jawole Zollar, Founding Artistic Director of Urban Bush Women. My work has expanded, deepened, and matured.  My community organizing has also grown, and that affects my art--how I think about it, who it is for, and what we all have to gain.<b> I am blessed to be held by a circle of powerful thinkers, makers, and dreamers.

He is the former Artistic Director of Lilac City Performing Arts, a theatre company committed to producing work about social and personal issues in the Inland Northwest. In New York City, he's directed the staged reading of <i>Once Upon</i> with Writopia Labs and acted the role of Chris Pasco in <i>Ophelia </i>with Gotham Dance Theater. Justin developed a devising method with which he directed <i>Hog Heaven</i> and <i>On the Subway</i> for Old Orchard Theatre. His method begins with actors bringing source material that inspire them regarding the premise. In the case with <i>Solitaire</i>, actors used the premise of depression. The focus was not only the darkness of depression, but also the light; finding the balance. Justin then conducted improvisation exercises to draw out theatrical ways to present the source material around the metaphor of the classic card game Solitaire. He then wrote the script in twenty days based on the material learned by the cast in source material and improvisation. The result is the story told in <i>Solitaire</i> about Jordan and Christy who both live with depression and how it affects their lives as well as those who love them. This play will have its first appearance at Joria Productions in New York City the second weekend of September.</p>

<p><i>Solitaire</i> is a significant play because it delves into a taboo subject. Depression is a serious condition that not only plagues the world, but also has strong roots in New York City.  Moreover, the effects of depression are detrimental to both the individual and those who love them. According the Andrew Solomon, author of the Pulitzer Prize Finalist book <i>Noonday Demon</i>, 15% of individuals who are depressed will attempt suicide. It is the hope of this ensemble to help audience members want to talk about this subject, give hope that one can live a thriving life with depression, and perhaps inspire the 15% that taking one's life does not have to be the answer. Moreover, 20% of ticket sales will be given to The Trevor Project as a donation to help their work in reaching LGBT youth who struggle with depression and considering suicide. (Justin M. Schlabach and <i>Solitaire: An Original Play</i> are not affiliated with The Trevor Project)</p>
<p>This Indiegogo campaign is the means to present this work. With the funds raised we can pay for the performance space,  props, costumes, set, and rehearsal space. Your contribution will make this play happen and perhaps have an impact on individuals who live with depression.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We need to raise at least $3,600 to present <i>Solitaire</i>. Our budget breakdown is as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>$850 for the Performance Space Rental</li>
<li>$1,500 for Rehearsal Space Rental</li>
<li>$500 for the Set, Props, and Costumes</li>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p><i>Solitaire</i> delves into the darkness of depression. According to Andrew Solomon, ""About 3 percent of Americans - some 19 million - suffer from chronic depression. More than 2 million of those are children."" This subject is one that is rarely talked about and needs to be addressed. In addition, this play also provides suggestion on how to live with depression. Knowing that living a vital life with depression is a personal and subjective path, <i>Solitaire</i> sensitively gives hope while pointing individuals in the direction to the help they themselves need. It is our hope that this play will reach individuals who need to hear about it either because they themselves deal with depression in their everyday life or they know of someone who lives with depression. With the numbers being so high and the risk too great, Depression needs to be discussed and people made aware. Moreover, with the ensemble's desire to donate to The Trevor Project, this production will not only create awareness, but also allocate funds to an organization that helps depressed LGBTQ youth on a daily basis and facilitates suicide prevention.</p>
<p>Justin M. Schlabach has used his devising method to create two previous plays: <i>Hog Heaven</i> and <i>On the Subway</i>. <i>Hog Heaven</i> emphasized the importance of family and <i>On the Subway</i> explored the nature of friendship. Both productions moved audience members to the point where they remembered the stories and their messages years later. Justin's goal is to do the same with <i>Solitaire</i>. This play can have a positive influence on the city of New York and to the extended geography that audience members will take it.</p>

<br/>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The biggest risk with <i>Solitaire</i> is having people hear about the production. New York City has so many plays with companies that have bigger budgets to market their shows. Moreover, while <i>Solitaire</i> will be performing in Hell's Kitchen, it is also near all the well-known Broadway houses which can distract audience member from seeing this play. However, we will use the resources we have to let as many people know about <i>Solitaire</i> as possible. A press release has been sent to many publications including The New York Times, PlayBill, New York Magazine, New York Post, Time Out, Village Voice, among others. Flyers will be printed for use to spread to people the ensemble meets in our interactions to let them know about the play. We will also be using word-of-mouth, Facebook, and Instagram to spread the word. Our success will be dependent on people like you to take the time to share this play in your personal interactions and on your social media. If we can raise more than our $3,600 goal, we can use the funds for marketing materials to broaden the circumference of awareness. Between our efforts and your assistance in creating awareness, we can let as many people know about this play as possible even without a large marketing budget.</p>

promuovere l’improvvisazione teatrale, l’arte dello stare in
scena senza testo.

Oltre
a essere una compagnia teatrale che propone spettacoli completamente
improvvisati, Teatribù è una scuola di teatro dotata di
caratteristiche uniche nel panorama delle scuole di recitazione
milanesi: la sua peculiarità, infatti, è quella di convergere
prevalentemente sull’improvvisazione.





www.teatribu.itIl
progetto gode del prezioso sostegno delle realtà improvvisative italiane de I Bugiardini (Roma), Improvincia (Brianza) e DettoFatto (Torino).

Perché abbiamo bisogno di voi?
Perchè sappiamo che sono i
partecipanti, gli amanti dell'improvvisazione e gli improvvisatori a
nutrire questa arte che noi amiamo e che i migliori sponsor per
questa attività di eccellenza sia chi ne percepisce il valore.
Cosa abbiamo pensato per
ringraziarti per il tuo aiuto?
Abbiamo pensato a delle ricompense speciali: magliette autografate, dedica speciale di
un’improvvisazione, esclusivi workshop, pass per il festival, anche uno spettacolo direttamente a casa tua. Se sei particolarmente
fanatico puoi anche diventare sponsor principale!
Con i fondi che ci aiuterai a
raccogliere contiamo di portare a termine le spese dell’intero
festival, come ad esempio coprire le spese di affitto del teatro,
l’alloggio e il vitto per gli artisti, le spese di organizzazione
e il lavoro finora fatto dai nostri videomaker, grafici e
comunicatori per dare corpo ed anima all'evento... organizzare un
festival mette tante risorse ed energie in campo!Dai
un'occhiata alla colonna qui a destra per scoprire che cosa abbiamo
preparato per ringraziarti del tuo contributo.
Non puoi contribuire
economicamente? Il tuo impegno può comunque fare la differenza:
parla del progetto, diffondilo condividendo questa pagina progetto
Indiegogo sui social e parlane a quante più persone possibile;
aiutaci a far conoscere la nostra proposta.
Ti

    the history 
Whistleblower has been in development since 2012 and is part 2 of a trilogy tilted Dystopian Distractions!  Part 1 premiered at DANCEWORKS, Santa Barbara in April 2014.
""I created this series of work because I was concerned that little work is being made in the modern dance community about war.

The biggest inherent risk is getting butts in seats every night.  There is stiff competition among alternative performance spaces for a finite amount of theatre goers. 
In addition, there are sure to be unforeseen expenses - especially when it comes to last minute costume and set changes. Furthermore, there is always the potential for the need for extra rehearsal which would incur fees for space and artist overtime.
The biggest challenge is making a work that appeals to the populace while maintaining experimental integrity.

<h1><b>The Show...</b></h1>
<p>Two people so rarely find each other at the right moment in time. But when they do, there's no telling what can happen. <i><b>Danny and the Deep Blue Sea</b></i> explores two people who desperately want a second chance at a better life.  Danny and Roberta are willing to fight, literally and figuratively, to find the love and companionship they so desperately need. In an aggressive yet sensitive dance, this play explores the beautiful complexities of love and relationships between two troubled loners who accidently find one another.  Shanley pushes the limits and finds a balance between sex and violence in this incredibly provocative play.</p>

<h2><b><span>About the project</span></b></h2>
<p>Shakespeare has been
popular in Malawi
for over 100 years and his plays are widely studied, <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> being the current curriculum text. However, with English as a second language, many students find Shakespeare hard to understand and enjoy. <b>Bilimankhwe
Arts </b>has engaged Caine Prize
nominated Malawian writer, <b>Stanley Onjezani Kenani </b>to produce a poetic translation of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> to be performed at <b>Chancellor
College</b> in Malawi in April 2016. </p>
<p>The
production will have a Malawian cast, drawing from the very best of Malawi's professional actors and students from Chancellor College's Performing Arts Department. It
will be directed by international theatre director <b>Amy
Bonsall </b>with a Malawian
assistant director. </p>
<p>Students in Malawi currently only have access to English
versions of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> and this is an amazing opportunity to give them a
translation in Chichewa, the most widely spoken language in Malawi. The educational impact of
this is huge and teachers, students, academics, theatre practitioners and

<h4>The translation</h4>
<p>This project is the first time Shakespeare has been translated by a recognised international Malawian writer into one of the major languages of Malawi. Audiences have previously only had access to English versions of Romeo and Juliet and this is an amazing opportunity for them to be able to access Shakespeare in Chichewa. </p>
<p>Having run workshops at Chancellor College with the performing Arts students, Amy was struck by the difference it made to the students to work with the text in Chichewa rather than English. They were able to use the wordplay, imagery and subtlety of the words in their performances, something they said had been much more difficult in English. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We
will publish the Chichewa and the English text alongside each other on the
page. The text
and translation will be clear and easy for the reader to follow the play in
both languages, and move between the two. <span>By making the production available
online and publishing the play text, we will be able to reach many school
students who are studying <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>. We
have conducted research with teachers and students who have made it clear that
this translation would be invaluable for them.</span></p>

</div></div>","British theatre director
Amy Bonsall and Malawian writer Stanley Kenani are collaborating to translate Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet into
Chichewa, and tour it around Malawi.
Please help us to support this unique project.




You will be
     helping to fund the first ever production of a poetic translation of Romeo
     and Juliet into Chichewa.
You will be
     supporting the best of Malawi's
     actors and graduate actors.
You will be giving
     hundreds of Malawians (many of whom do not speak English) the opportunity to see Romeo and Juliet in
      their own language.
Thousands of
     students will have online access to a poetic translation of one of
     Shakespeare's great plays in their own language. 
What we need
We
are asking for £2500 which breaks down as follows:

9 actors = £150 pp
     = £1350 for 3 weeks rehearsal plus 3 performances plus £30pp for meals and
     travel = £270
1 writer payment =
     £150
1 assistant
     director payment £150
transport for tour
     and fuel = £280
set/costumes =
     £300
About the project
Shakespeare has been
popular in Malawi
for over 100 years and his plays are widely studied, Romeo and Juliet being the current curriculum text. However, with English as a second language, many students find Shakespeare hard to understand and enjoy. Bilimankhwe
Arts has engaged Caine Prize
nominated Malawian writer, Stanley Onjezani Kenani to produce a poetic translation of Romeo and Juliet to be performed at Chancellor
College in Malawi in April 2016. 
The
production will have a Malawian cast, drawing from the very best of Malawi's professional actors and students from Chancellor College's Performing Arts Department. It
will be directed by international theatre director Amy
Bonsall with a Malawian
assistant director. 
Students in Malawi currently only have access to English
versions of Romeo and Juliet and this is an amazing opportunity to give them a
translation in Chichewa, the most widely spoken language in Malawi. The educational impact of
this is huge and teachers, students, academics, theatre practitioners and
artists throughout Malawi
overwhelmingly support this project. The British Council in Malawi has
pledged to support the project by making the text available online. This really is an opportunity for you to support the making of theatre history.

<p><b>After the death of her mother, high school freshman Bloom moves in with her hapless uncle (Mark Marchillo) and feeble grandma (Lee Meriwether). With little support and encouragement at her disposal, she struggles to find her footing while adjusting to small town life. A dancer by nature, Bloom (Liv Southard) is determined to find an outlet for her despair, but there's nowhere to dance in this backwoods town - except the school dance team! Just as she's trying to fit in, the boyfriend of the team’s captain falls for her, catapulting Bloom into the spotlight against her soon-to-be arch nemesis. Bloom will have to fight to win her place, not only on the team, but with her new family, even if she has to ""break a leg.""</b></p>

Get The Real Story!<br/><br/><p>Ok, so <i>Breaking Legs</i> has been a long time coming. A LONG time... When I was 6 years old, I enrolled in dance classes at my own insistence because I knew I wanted to be in the movies. My father was a big film buff, and I was inspired by the stylings of Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire and Donald O’Connor; by great movies like Gone With The Wind and Kings Row, Rebecca and Peyton Place. In 2nd grade I got my first leading role in the epic Twain Harte Elementary play, “Soup for the King”, and I was off and running. Within four years I was dancing on scholarship in Los Angeles and Marin County, and eventually trained at the San Francisco Ballet school year round.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435821423/sfbm4vb9eteplnqpcgq1.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Throughout all this time, my poor mom had to shuttle me from place to place, saying goodbye for months at a time and inevitably move to San Francisco with me. The sacrifices she made motivated me to push even further, and, after several professional stage productions, I went on to study at the USC film school. All that time I was following my passion for acting and dancing, and then, directing, but I never really fit in during school. Being a boy in a girl’s world, was not acceptable at the time. Hence, I wanted to make a modern day story about a girl's struggle to fit in.<br/><p>This is what inspired me to make Breaking Legs, a coming of age story of triumph &amp; perseverance with the social message of you can do anything if you put your mind to it! It's a great mix of struggle and comedy, because no matter how bad it gets, you can always still laugh. No one can take that away from you!</p>
<p>I was bound and determined to make my first feature film this year. After about a decade of waiting around, thinking that some magical investor fairy was someday going to show up, I finally just decided it was now or never. And we did it! Well, almost. So long story short, I knew I had to make this movie no matter what. The script shaped up fast, and things started falling into place. But there still wasn’t money… But knowing that delaying production would probably end in defeat, I created the money out of thin air. In other words, I bled my 401K, and put together two other sources to make enough money to get us all the way through production. </p>
<p>And thank God, it worked; well, almost. We still have 3 more scenes to shoot with celebrity talent! So now, we’re entering post production, and this is where we need your help! We'll need sound design, color correction, sound mix, music rights, composer fees, digital fees, more film expenses… well, it adds up like you wouldn’t believe. </p>
<p>This a big dream of mine, and I can’t tell you how happy I am even now; it’s all coming true! I hope you can help us get to the finish line. Any amount of generosity is another step forward in me achieving my lifelong dream. We'll reward you for your generosity with schwag from the film, tickets to the screening, DVD's, Posters, and even a chance to be in the movie &amp; become one of the film's producers (how cool is that!). I hope you're able to check out the trailer for a glimpse of greatness; this little movie that could, really can be. Thank you for being a part of Breaking Legs, you'll be glad that you did!</p>

Riehle went on to give a memorable portrayal of the Reverend Scroggins who twists the truth on the witness stand in Jon Avnet's ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" (1991). In 1993, he was the older guard who survives the train crash with Richard Kimball in ""The Fugitive"" and also appeared as a member of the panel in ""Jury Duty"" and in a small role in ""Casino"" (both 1995). It wasn't until Mike Judge's, cult classic, ""Office Space"" (1999) hit VHS that people really started to recognize Richard and even so far as quoting lines from the movie. <p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435386914/bqt9bxd9lmbkezujmhb9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3>The Impact - From Rags to Riches - We All Win!</h3>
<p>Coming of Age Stories are those which really leave you feeling fluffy inside. Often done with passion and very little money, they generally aren't the big blockbusters of the summer. However, the blockbuster is the story itself. A prime example is the film called, ""Once."" This little Independent movie became a success, garnering over $9Million at the box-office, even though it was made for an Ultra Low Budget, like ours. This goes to show you that if you really tell a good story others' hearts will watch and follow.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges - The Audience &amp; The Fans - You!</h3>
<p>Raising funds is not easy. However, having filmed most of the movie already, we are steps ahead of the rest. We have created these entertaining videos (which you have all seen by this time), a great trailer, and have tagged our product placement sponsors; reaching their market as well. The more we all get involved the more this film will get seen. It's all about social awareness. At the end of the day, it's the audience that benefit from donating or spreading the word about ""Breaking Legs,"" the little film that could. This way we can keep making family friendly films and entertaining all audiences.</p>
<h3>Post-Production Completion Funds</h3>

""Footloose"" Meets ""Mean Girls""
After the death of her mother, high school freshman Bloom moves in with her hapless uncle (Mark Marchillo) and feeble grandma (Lee Meriwether). With little support and encouragement at her disposal, she struggles to find her footing while adjusting to small town life. A dancer by nature, Bloom (Liv Southard) is determined to find an outlet for her despair, but there's nowhere to dance in this backwoods town - except the school dance team! Just as she's trying to fit in, the boyfriend of the team’s captain falls for her, catapulting Bloom into the spotlight against her soon-to-be arch nemesis. Bloom will have to fight to win her place, not only on the team, but with her new family, even if she has to ""break a leg.""
Listen to us talk about our influences and our love for the '80s, especially dance films! http://crowdfundingcast.tk/crowdfunding-cast-ep...

 Why I Made Breaking Legs? Get The Real Story!Ok, so Breaking Legs has been a long time coming. A LONG time... When I was 6 years old, I enrolled in dance classes at my own insistence because I knew I wanted to be in the movies. My father was a big film buff, and I was inspired by the stylings of Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire and Donald O’Connor; by great movies like Gone With The Wind and Kings Row, Rebecca and Peyton Place. In 2nd grade I got my first leading role in the epic Twain Harte Elementary play, “Soup for the King”, and I was off and running. Within four years I was dancing on scholarship in Los Angeles and Marin County, and eventually trained at the San Francisco Ballet school year round.
Throughout all this time, my poor mom had to shuttle me from place to place, saying goodbye for months at a time and inevitably move to San Francisco with me. The sacrifices she made motivated me to push even further, and, after several professional stage productions, I went on to study at the USC film school. All that time I was following my passion for acting and dancing, and then, directing, but I never really fit in during school. Being a boy in a girl’s world, was not acceptable at the time. Hence, I wanted to make a modern day story about a girl's struggle to fit in.This is what inspired me to make Breaking Legs, a coming of age story of triumph & perseverance with the social message of you can do anything if you put your mind to it! It's a great mix of struggle and comedy, because no matter how bad it gets, you can always still laugh. No one can take that away from you!
I was bound and determined to make my first feature film this year. After about a decade of waiting around, thinking that some magical investor fairy was someday going to show up, I finally just decided it was now or never. And we did it! Well, almost. So long story short, I knew I had to make this movie no matter what. The script shaped up fast, and things started falling into place. But there still wasn’t money… But knowing that delaying production would probably end in defeat, I created the money out of thin air. In other words, I bled my 401K, and put together two other sources to make enough money to get us all the way through production. 
And thank God, it worked; well, almost. We still have 3 more scenes to shoot with celebrity talent! So now, we’re entering post production, and this is where we need your help! We'll need sound design, color correction, sound mix, music rights, composer fees, digital fees, more film expenses… well, it adds up like you wouldn’t believe. 
This a big dream of mine, and I can’t tell you how happy I am even now; it’s all coming true! I hope you can help us get to the finish line. Any amount of generosity is another step forward in me achieving my lifelong dream. We'll reward you for your generosity with schwag from the film, tickets to the screening, DVD's, Posters, and even a chance to be in the movie & become one of the film's producers (how cool is that!). I hope you're able to check out the trailer for a glimpse of greatness; this little movie that could, really can be. Thank you for being a part of Breaking Legs, you'll be glad that you did!

She is perhaps best known for her role as Betty Jones, Buddy Ebsen's secretary and daughter-in-law in the long-running 1970s crime drama Barnaby Jones. The role earned her two Golden Globe Awardnominations in 1975 and 1976, and an Emmy Award nomination in 1977. She is also known for her role as John Schuck's long-haired wife, Lily Munster, in the 1980ssitcom The Munsters Today, as well as for her portrayal of Catwoman in the 1966 film version of Batman. Meriwether had a recurring role as Ruth Martin on the daytime soap opera All My Children until the end of the series in September 2011.

 
Chris Kattan (ROBBIE) is an American actor/comedian, best known for his work on Saturday Night Live and his role as Bob on the first four seasons of The Middle. He is also known for playing Doug Butabi in A Night at the Roxbury. 
Kattan attended high school in Seattle where he performed in a number of school plays. He decided to follow in his father's footsteps and returned to the L.A. area to join The Groundlings, while studying acting and directing at the University of California at Northridge. He continued to perform in live theater productions while in college.
It wasn't long before Chris was spotted by a producer of Saturday Night Live, and in 1996, he joined the cast.
While working on the legendary show, Kattan created many memorable characters, including: the Roxbury Guy, the half-monkey Mr. Peepers, the gibberish-spouting Suel Forrester, Azrael Abyss, the co-host of the fictional cable access show ""Goth Talk”, and the enigmatic exotic dancer, Mango.
Kattan went on to land many more roles in feature films such as House On Haunted Hill, Lucky Numbers and Monkeybone.
Besides film and SNL, Kattan has also guest-starred on several network television programs, including NewsRadio and Grace Under Fire.
He remained an SNL cast member until 2003. Currently he lives in Los Angeles and is concentrating on his film career, with roles in independent features such asSanta's Slay (2005) and Christmas in Wonderland (2007).
In June 2014, Chris reprised his role as former SNL character Mango in a preview of Missy Elliott protégée Sharaya J's ""Shut It Down"" via a T by Alexander Wang campaign.
 With his mustache, receding hairline and somewhat portly frame, Richard Riehle(PRINCIPAL BATER) has often been cast as corrupt characters whose bravado melts in the face of adversity, He spent over 15 years working in repertory theaters in Oregon, Alaska, Arizona and elsewhere, in addition to teaching acting in Northern California and at the University of Washington. Riehle ventured to Broadway in 1985 and beginning a career as a working character player. After debuting in ""Execution of Justice"", a play based on the murder of Harvey Milk, he remained in New York and often worked with the Classic Stage Company and the Public Theatre. Roles in the movies ""Black Rain"" and ""Glory"" (both 1989) and the miniseries ""Cross of Fire"" (NBC, 1989) convinced him to move to Los Angeles. It was his part in ""Glory"" that actually put Riehle on the potential casting lists in Hollywood. Riehle went on to give a memorable portrayal of the Reverend Scroggins who twists the truth on the witness stand in Jon Avnet's ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" (1991). In 1993, he was the older guard who survives the train crash with Richard Kimball in ""The Fugitive"" and also appeared as a member of the panel in ""Jury Duty"" and in a small role in ""Casino"" (both 1995). It wasn't until Mike Judge's, cult classic, ""Office Space"" (1999) hit VHS that people really started to recognize Richard and even so far as quoting lines from the movie.

I’ll never forget that.” He has been awarded Best Pop Rock Artist at an event with RK Records, Best Male Vocalist Rising Star at Hollywood Rock The Mic, and 1st Place in his category for SCV’s Most Talented Performers’ Competition.

The Impact - From Rags to Riches - We All Win!
Coming of Age Stories are those which really leave you feeling fluffy inside. Often done with passion and very little money, they generally aren't the big blockbusters of the summer. However, the blockbuster is the story itself. A prime example is the film called, ""Once."" This little Independent movie became a success, garnering over $9Million at the box-office, even though it was made for an Ultra Low Budget, like ours. This goes to show you that if you really tell a good story others' hearts will watch and follow.
Risks & Challenges - The Audience & The Fans - You!
Raising funds is not easy. However, having filmed most of the movie already, we are steps ahead of the rest. We have created these entertaining videos (which you have all seen by this time), a great trailer, and have tagged our product placement sponsors; reaching their market as well. The more we all get involved the more this film will get seen. It's all about social awareness. At the end of the day, it's the audience that benefit from donating or spreading the word about ""Breaking Legs,"" the little film that could. This way we can keep making family friendly films and entertaining all audiences.

<strong>Medicine Ball: Playwrights v. Poets is in danger!

</strong><p><strong>The mafia is taking over!</strong> </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445864297/ejqyfdzkkplnqobcb8jk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>For the past three years, Seattle Theatre Works has been
fully producing this annual literary boxing match which brings a team of 7
playwrights and 7 poets together to test their mettle against one another in a
fierce competition for some major spoils – either a bottle of Two Buck Chuck
for the winners or a can of warm Pabst Blue Ribbon beer for the losers!</p>
<p>Pretty clear, huh? </p>
<p>Well, we don’t like this to be very clear.</p>
<p>That’s why we named our event after an obscure piece of
exercise equipment. So we decided to make it even more challenging for the
writers and more confusing for the audience by inviting local visual artists to
participate! We now use their artwork as prompts for the writers. So when we
present the plays and poems, we project the visual art so the audience can see
how each writer responded to the piece. </p>
<p>And then the audience gets to vote on which piece they liked
better – the play or the poem. </p>
<p>It’s fun. It’s collaborative. It community building. </p>
<p>And it doesn’t make any money at all. </p>
<p>So now - as you can see in the video above – the mafia is
about to infiltrate the event. </p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE NEED &amp; WHAT YOU GET</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445864384/yht5hgjqeuibq435u0by.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Please help Seattle Theatre Works maintain its integrity. If
we can make our goal, we’ll be able to keep the Mafioso at bay. If we don’t,
the mob will take over with their bookies and their drug dealers and their
strippers and their concrete boots. Who knows if any of the poets or playwrights
will even get out alive? </p>
<p>Not only will your contribution keep the mafia at bay, it
will help us pay for the rental space at the lovely Erickson Theatre on Capitol
Hill in early February, clothe our actors in costume pieces, light them so they look pretty,
print some posters so people know this event is happening, and buy some booze
to serve people during the show – because there is nothing better than watching
a literary boxing match except watching a literary boxing match completely
drunk.</p>
<p>And in order to expose more people to this weird, convoluted
event – and help the writers reach a broader audience - each $20 donation will
buy 1 ticket that will be given to a local charity who can in turn either auction
the tickets off, give them to donors, or share them with the clients they
serve. The mafia doesn’t like this – and they especially don’t like that it’s
cumulative – a $40 donation equaling two tickets to charity, $100 equaling five.
</p>
<p>Charities you can choose to donate your tickets to:</p>
<ul>
<li>North Seattle College Education Fund</li>
<li>University District  Food Bank</li>
<li>Humane Society For Seattle and King County</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>RISKS</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445864433/rz244jtinewpg9ovttow.jpg"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Are there risks? Besides the possibility that a writer might
accidentally poke their eye out with a pencil, the MAFIA WILL TAKE OVER! They’re
already talking to writers about fixing the competition!</p>
<p><strong>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</strong></p>
<p>We know you don’t want the mafia to turn our tongue-in-cheek
literary competition between teams of writers both toiling away in dying art
forms that have lost almost all their cultural relevance and turn it into a
Vegas style show with glitter and legs and tiger acts. But we also know many
people don’t have money – especially other writers and artists – because, well,
you’re writers and artists. So if you can’t donate but still want to help us
foil this coup this mafia is planning, please do share this fundraising
campaign with friends s long as they don’t have any mafia ties. We’re trying
to keep this on the down low. </p>

fierce competition for some major spoils – either a bottle of Two Buck Chuck
for the winners or a can of warm Pabst Blue Ribbon beer for the losers!
Pretty clear, huh? 
Well, we don’t like this to be very clear.
That’s why we named our event after an obscure piece of
exercise equipment. So we decided to make it even more challenging for the
writers and more confusing for the audience by inviting local visual artists to
participate! We now use their artwork as prompts for the writers. So when we
present the plays and poems, we project the visual art so the audience can see
how each writer responded to the piece. 
And then the audience gets to vote on which piece they liked
better – the play or the poem. 
It’s fun. It’s collaborative. It community building. 
And it doesn’t make any money at all. 
So now - as you can see in the video above – the mafia is
about to infiltrate the event. 
WHAT WE NEED & WHAT YOU GET



Please help Seattle Theatre Works maintain its integrity. If
we can make our goal, we’ll be able to keep the Mafioso at bay. If we don’t,
the mob will take over with their bookies and their drug dealers and their
strippers and their concrete boots. Who knows if any of the poets or playwrights
will even get out alive? 
Not only will your contribution keep the mafia at bay, it
will help us pay for the rental space at the lovely Erickson Theatre on Capitol
Hill in early February, clothe our actors in costume pieces, light them so they look pretty,
print some posters so people know this event is happening, and buy some booze
to serve people during the show – because there is nothing better than watching
a literary boxing match except watching a literary boxing match completely
drunk.
And in order to expose more people to this weird, convoluted
event – and help the writers reach a broader audience - each $20 donation will
buy 1 ticket that will be given to a local charity who can in turn either auction
the tickets off, give them to donors, or share them with the clients they
serve. The mafia doesn’t like this – and they especially don’t like that it’s
cumulative – a $40 donation equaling two tickets to charity, $100 equaling five.

Charities you can choose to donate your tickets to:

North Seattle College Education Fund
University District  Food Bank
Humane Society For Seattle and King County

RISKS



Are there risks? Besides the possibility that a writer might
accidentally poke their eye out with a pencil, the MAFIA WILL TAKE OVER! They’re
already talking to writers about fixing the competition!
OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP
We know you don’t want the mafia to turn our tongue-in-cheek
literary competition between teams of writers both toiling away in dying art
forms that have lost almost all their cultural relevance and turn it into a
Vegas style show with glitter and legs and tiger acts. But we also know many
people don’t have money – especially other writers and artists – because, well,
you’re writers and artists. So if you can’t donate but still want to help us
foil this coup this mafia is planning, please do share this fundraising
campaign with friends s long as they don’t have any mafia ties. We’re trying
to keep this on the down low.",4.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p>Hello! My name is Danielle O'Neill and I am the proud founder of Act I - Act III (a fiscally sponsored non-profit).  I have taught and performed in the Los Angeles community for decades. Through the years, I've seen how youth are impacted by performance art and I have also sadly seen performers, who were my mentors years ago, find the need to work in other fields to maintain their livelihood.  Act I- Act III is designed to help both ends of that age spectrum.  We found a diamond in the rough in Pasadena to be our new home for this thriving educational and performance theater. This historical theater has been vacant for decades and needs several renovations to bring it back to life.  For example, the theater needs wood floor, where our students will take classes and seating for our guests during live performances. </p>

<h3>Connecting.  Coaching.  Creating.</h3>
<p>Young Choreographers Project is about connecting, coaching, and creating. Beginning in February, young aspiring dancers from the inner-city of Los Angeles will be partnered with professional dance mentors.  Students will work closely with dance professionals over an 8-week period to create original dance pieces that will be showcased in April.  We have already been able to touch the lives of over 100 students, and we would love to expand this opportunity to more communities in the Los Angeles area.  However, we need YOUR support to make this happen.</p>
<p>Program Dates:  February 5, 2017 - March 26, 2017</p>
<p>Tech Rehearsal:  April 1, 2017</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>What we have found is that the process of creating through the art of choreography provides each student with an incresed sense of confidence and self-esteem, and it gives them the ability to truly express themselves through movement.  In addition, our students learn how to be leaders and to effectively communicate their thoughts and ideas to their peers. </p>
<p><strong>Socialization Benefits:  </strong>Dance education can help students improve their social and communication skills, learn how to work as part of a team, and develop a greater sense of trust and cooperation.</p>
<p><strong>Educational Benefits:</strong>  Becoming a skilled dancer requires practice, discipline and focus, skills that can be useful in other areas of a child's life. Students who have a background in dance tend to achieve significantly higher SAT scores and do better in math and science competitions.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Self-Esteem: </strong> As children adjust to the movements and postures required in dance, they begin to get a better sense of their bodies. As they become more comfortable in their own skin, their confidence and self-esteem also improve. Dance lessons can encourage children to foster a more positive attitude and explore their own self-expression. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>In brief:</p>
<p>The formative years of young lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) are more difficult than those of their heterosexual and cis-gender counterparts. We want to change that. We believe theatre is a vehicle to show young people they are not alone but also to present new information to the rest of the population in an interesting and engaging manner.</p> <p>The ‘long story’:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our first foray into live, original theatre was a big success but also a learning curve. We are convinced that, after receiving advice from critics and industry professionals we can make ‘Sexual Fears of a Modern Day Virgin’ a success whilst maintaining its focus on representing young LGBTQ people. We know from feedback and interest in planned performances that the play’s message is increasingly relevant as conservative societal forces grow - this is Rant and Rave’s raison d’etre.  We are determined to develop and improve the play dramatically.</li>
<li>Our primary aim is not only to help young LGBTQ people to feel accepted and represented, but to show them it is possible to create shows around minority identities that are successful. Through social media we will maintain contact with our audiences, providing them with advice on how they can participate in and create their own theatre. Our secondary aim is to confront our audience with identities they have not considered before, explored in an intriguing and theatrically exciting way. We want our audience to be encouraged to think, discuss, and question sexuality and gender identity, and to explore the breadth of identities which exist in a positive and accepting manner.</li>
<li>We will experiment with the dramaturgical challenges of presenting naturalistic theatre which engages with the audience. Our first focus has been the sensitive and accurate representation of the LGBTQ community; the next step will challenge us to present those honest stories in an even more dramatically exciting way that audiences can relate to. This is a key second step on the road towards popular theatre which is not rooted in broad, identity politics, but rather the experiences of individuals interacting with other individuals.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>£500 (with the other funding we have secured) will allow us to fund the upcoming tour of ‘Sexual Fears of a Modern Day Virgin’. This includes the cost of hiring venues, paying for the travel and accommodation costs of all cast and crew, and the cost of the set. If we secure more than this £500 we will be able to look into paying the subsistence cost of the cast and crew (as no one is receiving a salary).</p>
<p>We are currently planning these performances of ‘Sexual Fears of a Modern Day Virgin’:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Maddermarket Theatre, Norwich - matinee and evening performance on the 10th May.</li>
<li>We will then take the show to London for two nights (venue TBC).</li>
<li>Finally, we will go to the Lantern @ ACT at the Brighton Fringe Festival on the 29th May, 1st, 2nd and 3rd June,</li>
<li>We will also do two free performances for local LGBTQ youth groups in Norwich and then in Brighton.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We believe that spreading positive awareness of, and normalising, LGBTQ experiences, especially for young people, is a valuable endeavour that will not only widen the artistic base of LGBTQ theatre in the UK. We are convinced that original theatre delivered by Rant and Rave can change minds.</p>

Manifesto: Society for Cutting Up Men,” which suggested that in order for women to be truly liberated, they must overthrow the government and kill all men. SCUM: A MANIFESTO is a look inside the mind of the woman who shot Andy Warhol and an examination of the feminist movement today. Watch us cross the line of traditional theatre, over and over...Our tour begins with the St-Ambroise Montreal Fringe Festival from June 8-June 18 at Mainline Theatre, followed by the Hamilton Fringe Theatre Festival from July 20th-30th and finally the Edmonton International Fringe Tour from August 17th-27th. Since its premiere at the PotashCorp Saskatoon Fringe Theatre Festival in 2016, the play has undergone a developmental workshop by Canadian playwright, Vern Thiesen (Einstein’s Gift, Vimy) and was featured in the Saskatchewan Playwrights Centre’s Spring Festival of New Plays.SCUM is created entirely by female theatre artists: Laura Andreas (Stage Manager), S.E.

<p>As students, our finances are incredibly limited. We have invested everything we have into this project, and this theatre company. Our financial constraints put a creative constraint on what we can do in theatre.

We have had super generous donations from Temple of Seitan, Wellness Centre and Clapham Picturehouse as unique perks for our backers, and we also have a signed copy of the play from the amazing OBIE-award winning playwright, CARIDAD SVICH (we love you, Caridad!)

As students, our finances are incredibly limited. We have invested everything we have into this project, and this theatre company. Our financial constraints put a creative constraint on what we can do in theatre. This is what we want to pursue for the rest of our lives, so the money raised will go towards making our dreams of Edinburgh Fringe possible!
Other Ways of Supporting Us:
Even if you are not able to financially support us, any help with getting the word out to those who can with the indiegogo sharing tools, and general noise about what we are trying to do, is just as appreciated by us!Facebook: facebook.com/ravefableTwitter: @ClumsyBodies Lots of queer luv,Jess & Oli xxxxxx",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello fellow sponsors!</p>
<p>I am a proud graduate of the Illustrious Clark Atlanta University with a Bachelors in Theatre Arts.  I am a member of the Aurora Theatre Professional Acting Apprenticeship Company Class of 2016. I was selected as  1 of 2 directors for the 2018 Alumni Series based on my submission of Grace, or the Art of Climbing. In this series, directors are expected to self produce a play production. Everything from casting and  production team to marketing and fundraising is completely our responsibility.</p>
<p>I have been managing depression since I was 12 years old. Writing help me cope but Theatre Arts saved my life. I wanted to choose a piece that would help tell the story about those of us who want to conquer this mental illness.    </p>
<p> </p>
<p>To tell this story we need your help. </p>
<ul></ul>
<p><u><strong>What We Need </strong></u></p>
<p>We are asking you to help us raise at least $5000.</p>
<p>These funds will aid in the following:</p>

<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
</div><div><p>We often believe we have to seem flawless in the eyes of our friends and family when really we need their  support to overcome our darkest times.
