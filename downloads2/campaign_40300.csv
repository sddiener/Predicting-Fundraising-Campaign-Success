<p>Beekeeping in the Virunga region has a rich history dating back thousands of years and the skilful and complex technique of harvesting unique to this region is a highly treasured tradition among the community, passed on from generation to generation.</p>
<p>Our unique limited edition jars of natural honey will be carefully harvested from traditionally crafted hives located at the base of the Virunga Mountains. The honey is completely 100% pure and all-natural; it does not contain artificial flavours, preservatives or industrial-strength flavour extracts of any kind. It also has a strong, distinctive taste of this mountainous rainforest region that is sure to tease your taste buds!</p>
<p>Our ambition is to preserve the identity of our honey through processing, so that we can tell you exactly which apiaries the honey was harvested from and the stories of the region, the farmers and their families.</p>

<p><b>1.5 billion people</b> still use dangerous and expensive
kerosene lanterns in developing countries. Kerosene lanterns - a century-old
technology – are <b>fire hazards.</b></p>
<p>According
to the World Bank, <b>$36 Billion</b> is
spent on kerosene per year in developing countries. Up to <b>25% </b>of the income of a typical household is spent on kerosene.</p>
<p>Over <b>one million</b> people die each year from
kerosene-related accidents. </p><p><b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">The Solution: Solar Energy</b><br/></p>
<p>The Earth
receives more solar energy in <b>one hour</b>
than the world population consumes in a year. Most developing countries have
enormous solar power potential – for example, most of Africa
has around 325 days of strong sunlight a year.</p>
<p>Solar lights
do not have recurring costs and this will help to <b>alleviate poverty</b>.</p>
<p>Solar
lights are environmentally friendly and they are <b>5 x brighter</b> than kerosene lanterns. They are non-polluting and
therefore clean and safe for health and the environment.</p><p><b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">Our Work: Transforming Lives</b><br/></p>
<p>The
absence of electricity in many developing countries contributes substantially
to building up barriers to health and education.</p>
<p>We are
working with manufacturers and distributors to deliver quality, durable and
affordable solar lanterns and lighting kits to consumers.</p>
<p>Solar
lanterns and lighting kits will be given <b>free

will get the lanterns and lighting kits at a reduced price and will pay for

<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"">We have re-opened our campaign for an additional ten days (hence XL Dissent 2.0). In our first campaign we raised $9,300, and we wanted people to be able to continue to donate during the action itself and the week after.<br/><br/>XL DISSENT is the vision of a group of young organizers to respond to one of the most pressing environmental decisions of our time. If approved, the Keystone XL pipeline would increase the economic viability of extraction in Alberta, exacerbate pollution and health risks from refining, and spell game over for the climate. As young people we must respond: our future is on the line. We believe that by orchestrating the largest youth climate civil disobedience in US history we can send a strong message to President Obama: Unlock us from a fossil fuel future. XL Dissent is a weekend event that will include a civil disobedience training and divestment campaign meeting on Saturday, and an action on Sunday.<br/></span><br/>

The other cost for us is transportation-- we will be having buses come to DC from Minnesota, Maine, Wisconsin, Vermont, and others! Since this is a student-driven action, we want to be able to offset the cost to make it accessible to anyone who wants to be a part. If we do not reach our entire goal, the fundraised money will simply help to decrease the cost for students to be involved.</span></h3><div><span style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em; letter-spacing: 0.06em;""><br/></span></div><div><span style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em; letter-spacing: 0.06em;""><h3>The Impact</h3>

In our first campaign we raised $9,300, and we wanted people to be able to continue to donate during the action itself and the week after.XL DISSENT is the vision of a group of young organizers to respond to one of the most pressing environmental decisions of our time. If approved, the Keystone XL pipeline would increase the economic viability of extraction in Alberta, exacerbate pollution and health risks from refining, and spell game over for the climate. As young people we must respond: our future is on the line. We believe that by orchestrating the largest youth climate civil disobedience in US history we can send a strong message to President Obama: Unlock us from a fossil fuel future. XL Dissent is a weekend event that will include a civil disobedience training and divestment campaign meeting on Saturday, and an action on Sunday.
What We Need This action will also bring together students from all across the United States to converge on a shared vision of our planet's future. The other cost for us is transportation-- we will be having buses come to DC from Minnesota, Maine, Wisconsin, Vermont, and others! Since this is a student-driven action, we want to be able to offset the cost to make it accessible to anyone who wants to be a part. If we do not reach our entire goal, the fundraised money will simply help to decrease the cost for students to be involved.The Impact
Generations before have created the infrastructure that has led us to impending climate catastrophe. As young people who will be most impacted, we are standing up to say “enough”, and we need your support to speak truth to power.
We are working with 350.org, Energy Action Coalition, Greenpeace, and Chesapeake Climate Action Network to pull off this event. With their organizing assistance and the 75+ campuses that have already committed to attending, we know this will be a success.

We’ve come up with a system that allows you to shop online and care for the planet at the same time! Why? 
Did you know that home deliveries from online shopping generate a massive output of CO2 into the air? It’s tons, literally! 

Like you, we love the web and we buy all sorts of things online. So we decided to see if we could come up with some solution. And we did, it’s Leaffing!
What is Leaffing?




Leaffing is a software that calculates the CO2 emissions of home deliveries from online shopping and tells you how much it costs to neutralize those emissions by contributing to an offset project, such as reforestation.


In addition, Leaffing is a website where you can look up an item and find it in all the online shops that use the Leaffing software.


Leaffing is also a community network: all e-shops that use the Leaffing software are linked to the network of offset project that became part of the Leaffing System. 


Last but not least, Leaffing is a feedback mechanism, in which one single contribution can actually trigger many more! 



Why is Leaffing a Solution  


With our system everybody wins:




offset projects get to be financed,


e-shops gain new customers


and people are an active part of the solution!






What We Need Your Help For

CO2 emissions are on the rise and the situation in getting worse by the minute, so we want to develop the Leaffing System quickly



we need to continue developing the Leaffing System


we have to expand the network of offset projects and e-shops;


 and , most importantly, we need to make sure people know about Leaffing, which means a lot of marketing.


What You Will Get Out of This

</p><p><b>20/20 Vision:  Summary of Campaign</b></p>
<p>Replenish is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization
specifically created to provide clean water resources to developing countries.  Our purpose through the 20/20 Vision Campaign
is to give others the opportunity to be a part of our mission to specifically provide
clean water to schools in Homa Bay and the surrounding areas around Nairobi,
Kenya.  As our mission includes a
long-term commitment to specific communities, we are following up our successful
campaign in October, 2014 with our <b>Strategic Partner – Rotary Water Projects, Fort Lauderdale. </b> The 20/20 Vision
Campaign builds on that initial launch which provided clean water for 3-5 years
by providing purification filters and training for 82 schools and a Children’s
Home.</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; the Impact of Your Contribution</b></p>
<p>The 20/20 Vision Campaign is seeking to raise
$20,000 to provide clean water for an additional 20 schools as well as support
a mission trip for the leadership team to be a part of the distribution and
training as well as follow up with the schools receiving the clean water last
October to personally build relationship. 
</p>
<p>The priority in raising funds will be the clean
water resources first, the mission trip second. 
Once the 20 schools are funded through purchasing the filters, plans will be finalized for the mission trip to Kenya in June, 2015.  Through our established partners and
relationships in-country, the cost of the trip may decrease based on the offers
for support by our hosting partners.  Any
savings for trip expense will be directly used to purchase additional
purification resources for additional schools.</p>

<p><b><span>Risks &amp; Challenges</span></b></p>
<p>We believe
our risk is minimal in traveling to Kenya as we are confident in our
established relationships with locals, schools, and churches in the Nairobi and
Homa Bay area.  In addition, as the
warehouse for LifeStraw distribution is in Nairobi, there will be no risk
associated with transporting the filters across the country or between
countries.  In the unexpected case that a
travel restriction is enforced that results in cancelling the trip, ALL
refunded amounts will be redirected to purchase additional purification resources
for additional schools.</p>

relationships in-country, the cost of the trip may decrease based on the offers
for support by our hosting partners.  Any
savings for trip expense will be directly used to purchase additional
purification resources for additional schools.
The specifics for the $20,000 include:

Risks & Challenges
We believe
our risk is minimal in traveling to Kenya as we are confident in our
established relationships with locals, schools, and churches in the Nairobi and
Homa Bay area.  In addition, as the
warehouse for LifeStraw distribution is in Nairobi, there will be no risk
associated with transporting the filters across the country or between
countries.  In the unexpected case that a
travel restriction is enforced that results in cancelling the trip, ALL
refunded amounts will be redirected to purchase additional purification resources
for additional schools.

<p>Every year <a href=""http://pss.uvm.edu/ppp/articles/fuels.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2.2 billion gallons </a>of gasoline are used to maintain lawns alone in the United States, <span>notes Dr. Leonard Perry of the University of Vermont</span>. </p>
<p>The EPA estimates that <a href=""http://www.epa.gov/greenacres/toolkit/chap2.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">17 million gallons</a> of gasoline are spilled each year refueling lawn care equipment. This means we are drizzling more fuel on the ground than the Exxon Valdez oil spill, every single year. </p>
<p>The EPA also estimates that a single gasoline powered mower <a href=""http://www.epa.gov/greenacres/toolkit/chap2.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">contributes eleven times</a> the amount of pollution of that of a new car, per hour of operation. </p>
<p>Like many, I find these numbers disturbing. To address these issues I have built a landscape maintenance truck that runs on biodiesel and charges battery powered equipment as it drives. I have a basic set up that is functional and currently reducing the consumption of fossil fuels. </p>
<p>Drop by drop, I am making a difference.</p>
<p>Two years ago I had an opportunity to rethink not what I want to do with my life but how to do it. I was at square one. I started by purchasing the best truck I could afford. It cost $750. Imagine if you will, a 1994 F250, missing a couple of windows, the dash ripped apart with wires coming out of places there ought not be wires, the steering column disassembled with a hammer, no keys or straight body panels, and a load of decaying trash in the bed. Most people would never consider buying such a vehicle for obvious and understandable reasons. But I am not most people, I could see past the ugly exterior of the vehicle. Beneath the skin of this monstrosity was a rare, factory turbo diesel engine. The perfect platform to build a company and mobile power source upon. I pieced the ignition back together, put some fresh batteries in it and had it running within an hour. The engine fired up without struggle and made known the power that had been asleep under the hood. I shook the previous owners hand, did the appropriate paper work, gave him cash and drove off with a load of garbage and my new rescued work truck. </p>
<p>I immediately began piecing it back together and building upon my idea. I imagined combining multiple varieties of sustainable technologies and demonstrating responsible stewardship in the yards of homeowners, schools, and parks. In May of 2014 I completed an operational and functional base of my dream. I had created <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ecos-Landscaping/593410030748798"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ecos Landscaping </a>and maintained its first gasoline-free account. </p>
<p>Now that I have a working model of operation, I would like to share my project in the hopes of both gaining support and inspiring others to pursue sustainable enterprise. </p>
<p>I nicknamed my project ""<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Project-Proto-Hype/762717170436174"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The PROTO-HYPE</a>"" based on its experimental and promotional nature. It is a custom, heavy duty turbo diesel work truck, loaded with tools and capability. The PROTO-HYPE is fueled by B100 that comes from a local biodiesel manufacturer. A charge isolator allows me to maintain a secondary bank of batteries that is independent from the primary truck batteries . The secondary battery bank powers a DC to AC inverter creating your standard household outlet. From there, I plug in lithium-ion chargers to charge the batteries that run my landscape equipment. I have a basic set of battery tools that includes a small mower, hedger, string trimmer and blower. This is enough to get me through about three small residential accounts or one small apartment complex per day.  </p>
<p>My goal for this campaign is to acquire top of the line equipment as well as demonstrate the true potential of my vision. I will help establish a new standard of business within my industry and provide an easily duplicable model of operation to follow. </p>
<p>I prioritize environmental impact over the cost of doing business. It is not cheap to purchase cutting edge power equipment nor is it to experiment with new fuels but this is something I truly believe will make a positive difference in the world and therefore worth the added costs. The more that people support alternative fuel, energy, and sustainable business the more they will become readily available and competitive. My plan is to evolve with the introduction of new technologies and take reasonable risks to advance their use. </p>
<p>After all, if you don't want to go out on a limb, you probably shouldn't be a landscaper! </p>

<p>With any project it is reasonable to assume your going to run into an unanticipated obstacle. I have also adapted a skill to resolve things of this nature. First, tell yourself that something unexpected is bound to happen before you start and when it does, welcome it as a challenge. Step two is to identify what kind of an obstacle it is and decide if you have adequate resources to resolve the issue. If not, go get the necessary resources. Step three, keep an open mind and start the trial and error process. There have been many times I have found myself broke down in the mountains or the side of a remote highway by myself.  Many times I have been able to repair my vehicle to a varying degree and make it home safe. Over the years I have found the thing that makes the most difference in solving a problem is to stay creative and calm. It's okay to be bummed when things happen but it is essential to continue brainstorming and solving problems.  </p>

<p>In the event that this campaign is more than successful, additional funds will be applied toward expanding this business model-- more trucks and a sustainable garden supply store.

</div></div>","Every year 2.2 billion gallons of gasoline are used to maintain lawns alone in the United States, notes Dr. Leonard Perry of the University of Vermont. 
The EPA estimates that 17 million gallons of gasoline are spilled each year refueling lawn care equipment. This means we are drizzling more fuel on the ground than the Exxon Valdez oil spill, every single year. 
The EPA also estimates that a single gasoline powered mower contributes eleven times the amount of pollution of that of a new car, per hour of operation. 
Like many, I find these numbers disturbing. To address these issues I have built a landscape maintenance truck that runs on biodiesel and charges battery powered equipment as it drives. I have a basic set up that is functional and currently reducing the consumption of fossil fuels. 
Drop by drop, I am making a difference.
Two years ago I had an opportunity to rethink not what I want to do with my life but how to do it. I was at square one. I started by purchasing the best truck I could afford. It cost $750. Imagine if you will, a 1994 F250, missing a couple of windows, the dash ripped apart with wires coming out of places there ought not be wires, the steering column disassembled with a hammer, no keys or straight body panels, and a load of decaying trash in the bed. Most people would never consider buying such a vehicle for obvious and understandable reasons. But I am not most people, I could see past the ugly exterior of the vehicle. Beneath the skin of this monstrosity was a rare, factory turbo diesel engine. The perfect platform to build a company and mobile power source upon. I pieced the ignition back together, put some fresh batteries in it and had it running within an hour. The engine fired up without struggle and made known the power that had been asleep under the hood. I shook the previous owners hand, did the appropriate paper work, gave him cash and drove off with a load of garbage and my new rescued work truck. 
I immediately began piecing it back together and building upon my idea. I imagined combining multiple varieties of sustainable technologies and demonstrating responsible stewardship in the yards of homeowners, schools, and parks. In May of 2014 I completed an operational and functional base of my dream. I had created Ecos Landscaping and maintained its first gasoline-free account. 
Now that I have a working model of operation, I would like to share my project in the hopes of both gaining support and inspiring others to pursue sustainable enterprise. 
I nicknamed my project ""The PROTO-HYPE"" based on its experimental and promotional nature. It is a custom, heavy duty turbo diesel work truck, loaded with tools and capability. The PROTO-HYPE is fueled by B100 that comes from a local biodiesel manufacturer. A charge isolator allows me to maintain a secondary bank of batteries that is independent from the primary truck batteries . The secondary battery bank powers a DC to AC inverter creating your standard household outlet. From there, I plug in lithium-ion chargers to charge the batteries that run my landscape equipment. I have a basic set of battery tools that includes a small mower, hedger, string trimmer and blower. This is enough to get me through about three small residential accounts or one small apartment complex per day.  
My goal for this campaign is to acquire top of the line equipment as well as demonstrate the true potential of my vision. I will help establish a new standard of business within my industry and provide an easily duplicable model of operation to follow. 
I prioritize environmental impact over the cost of doing business. It is not cheap to purchase cutting edge power equipment nor is it to experiment with new fuels but this is something I truly believe will make a positive difference in the world and therefore worth the added costs. The more that people support alternative fuel, energy, and sustainable business the more they will become readily available and competitive. My plan is to evolve with the introduction of new technologies and take reasonable risks to advance their use. 
After all, if you don't want to go out on a limb, you probably shouldn't be a landscaper! 

What I Need 


The plan is to upgrade my existing battery bank and inverter, expand the tool arsenal, add some decent image and marketing to the mix and go to town.  
These are the needed components:

Four heavy duty 435 amp hour 6 volt batteries (as soon as organic based flow batteries are available I will upgrade)                                   $2,500
10,000 Watt DC to AC Inverter                                               $1,200

In Bed Transfer Fuel Tank and Pump                                    $1,000
Advertisement                                                                            $3,000
Perks                                                                                              $2,500

                                                                                        TOTAL          $21,750

This leaves me with a cushion of $3,250, about 15%, to cover unexpected expenses.

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Our Story</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span>
</h3>
<div></div>Aloha, my name is Sean Enoka and I am a bodysurfer from Oahu and founder of Kaha Nalu Hawaii.  Bodysurfing is the art of riding a wave without the assistance of any buoyant device such as a surfboard or bodyboard and is the traditional Hawaiian activity of Kaha Nalu.  I welcome you all to the Kaha Nalu Hawaii community and want to let you know more about what we have planned.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>
<div>Our campaign goal is to finance the launch of Kaha Nalu Hawaii - a bodysurfing brand that truly represents our passion and <span style="""">drive towards the art of Kaha Nalu and also celebrates our roots of the Hawaiian lifestyle.  We are not only proud that Hawaii is home to some of best bodysurfing on the planet but also the tremendous amount of aloha that our community generates and shares with the world.  </span><span style="""">With these two factors being our backbone, Kaha Nalu Hawaii will focus on performance and style in our design to create equipment, apparel, and clothing that will be at the forefront of the bodysurfing experience while instilling positivity into your local community and those around you for generations to come.</span>
</div>
<div><span style=""""><br/></span></div>
<div>
<span style="""">This project is special to me because there is nothing really out there for bodysurfers.  For years I've wished that there were someplace that we could turn, to get products and information that are just for us, but our sport is often overlooked by the surf industry </span><span style="""">and has not quite gotten there yet.  This is where we come in and my goal is to</span><span style=""""> create a brand to help spread the Hawaiian stoke, and perpetuate
Hawaiian Culture through Kaha Nalu, and bring together the Bodysurfing Ohana.  </span><br/>
</div>
<div><span style=""""><br/></span></div>
<div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We are building the Kaha Nalu Hawaii website geared to launch our brand to the global bodysurfing community.   We have been conducting extensive research and design and on all the products currently on the market and know that we can improve upon them.  The majority of equipment available worldwide is either geared towards surfing and snorkeling, outdated, poor quality and craftsmanship or simply designed by non-bodysurfers.  Our goal is for Kaha Nalu Hawaii to be a complete bodysurfing brand start to finish offering only the finest gear.  We are currently consulting with lead industry designers and the best wave-riders in the world to create a full line of premium bodysurfing-focused products.  Kaha Nalu Hawaii will initiate production on everything from trunks, rashguards, swim fins, to handplanes, wetsuits and clothing.  Simply put, Kaha Nalu Hawaii will create original products to raise your standards in regards to your bodysurfing equipment.</span></div>
<div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></div>
<div>By contributing to our campaign, you are helping us progress the art and are getting in on the ground level of a grass-roots movement of a local hawaiian business that could grow into the first international bodysurfing brand ever!</div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>
<span style="""">With our Indiegogo campaign we are attempting to create a spark in the global bodysurfing community that will hopefully lead to a huge fire.  We normally have problems with hand-outs unless they are for a really good cause.  And yes, this happens to be a </span><span style="""">great cause and you get some really cool rewards in return in addition to our deepest gratitude.  Our initial goal of raising $18,000 is to merely cover all start-up costs and begin limited run productions until we get a stronger foothold.  Our dream goal is to raise closer to $48,000 but we are willing to work slowly and diligently for as long as it takes.  We really want to start off on the right foot and if we do exceed our goal, then we have some exciting plans to take it to the next level but first let's talk about our reward system so many graciously donated to and what you get for your hard-earned money you supported Kaha Nalu Hawaii with. </span><br/>
</div>
<p><span style=""""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style="""">Out of respect, we reached out to many bodysurfing legends and explained our reasoning and goals for Kaha Nalu Hawaii and to see if we were in the right track.  Remarkably, every single one came back in utter support.  In fact, they all offered up amazing </span><span style="""">donations for the bodysurfing community.  So whether you are the greatest bodysurfer of all-time or a nervous grom about to go for their first swim , we thank you in all advance.  We cannot make this possible without everybody's support and we will recognize and reward all of our backers, regardless of donation amount.  Please remember, we tried to figure out a breakdown that will stoke out all supporter yet still raise as much funds as we can.  Hopefully, you agree.</span><br/></p>

***KAHA NALU HAWAII UPDATE***
Tuesday, September 30th, 2014
With 7 days left we are nearing our goal but could use a big push to get us there.
Please let everyone you know about our Kaha Nalu Hawaii indiegogo campaign.
MAHALO FOR THE SUPPORT




MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 22, 2014

Kaha Nalu Hawaii is committed to redesigning the antiquated 'bathing-suit' as you know it.  We will introduce a line of 3 different types of suits with our first being a speedsuit which will combine olympic technology and the industry's current boardshorts.
We are offering these on a limited prototype basis.  You will be riding what our team riders wear.
*All other perks will be available November 2014.*Founder Package included*WTSGM DVD included.*International shipping add $15
TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 16, 2014Kaha Nalu Hawaii is ecstatic to announce that we have recruited one of the industry's top designers with one goal in mind...to create the ultimate bodysurfing speedtrunks line.Until now, all surf trunks have been created with the board-surfer in mind.  We love hanging out in these trunks, but try to swim and catch waves in them for a few hours and they will leave you rashed up and destroyed.
These are this year's best selling surf trunks according to SIMA (Surf Industry Manufacturers Association).  If you notice, not a lot has changed since this 1973 ad below.Yes, better materials are currently being utilized, but nothing has changed in the design which would further enhance bodysurfing performance or comfort.Kaha Nalu Hawaii is working on a breakthrough design that will change the market forever.  In fact, we will completely revolutionize the way you even look at a tradition ""bathing suit.""Gone will be the days of walking like a crab and fearing the hot shower.  Anybody who bodysurfs knows exactly what I am talking about.Using, top-tier technology, materials and sustainable production practices, Kaha Nalu Hawaii will be introducing our line of speed trunks in 2015.  We believe, our trunks will even become the first choice of board-surfers as well.  Welcome to the paradigm shift.Mahalo and please share this campaign with your friends.

Our Story

Aloha, my name is Sean Enoka and I am a bodysurfer from Oahu and founder of Kaha Nalu Hawaii.  Bodysurfing is the art of riding a wave without the assistance of any buoyant device such as a surfboard or bodyboard and is the traditional Hawaiian activity of Kaha Nalu.  I welcome you all to the Kaha Nalu Hawaii community and want to let you know more about what we have planned.
Our campaign goal is to finance the launch of Kaha Nalu Hawaii - a bodysurfing brand that truly represents our passion and drive towards the art of Kaha Nalu and also celebrates our roots of the Hawaiian lifestyle.  We are not only proud that Hawaii is home to some of best bodysurfing on the planet but also the tremendous amount of aloha that our community generates and shares with the world.  With these two factors being our backbone, Kaha Nalu Hawaii will focus on performance and style in our design to create equipment, apparel, and clothing that will be at the forefront of the bodysurfing experience while instilling positivity into your local community and those around you for generations to come.



This project is special to me because there is nothing really out there for bodysurfers.  For years I've wished that there were someplace that we could turn, to get products and information that are just for us, but our sport is often overlooked by the surf industry and has not quite gotten there yet.  This is where we come in and my goal is to create a brand to help spread the Hawaiian stoke, and perpetuate
Hawaiian Culture through Kaha Nalu, and bring together the Bodysurfing Ohana.  


We are building the Kaha Nalu Hawaii website geared to launch our brand to the global bodysurfing community.   We have been conducting extensive research and design and on all the products currently on the market and know that we can improve upon them.  The majority of equipment available worldwide is either geared towards surfing and snorkeling, outdated, poor quality and craftsmanship or simply designed by non-bodysurfers.  Our goal is for Kaha Nalu Hawaii to be a complete bodysurfing brand start to finish offering only the finest gear.  We are currently consulting with lead industry designers and the best wave-riders in the world to create a full line of premium bodysurfing-focused products.  Kaha Nalu Hawaii will initiate production on everything from trunks, rashguards, swim fins, to handplanes, wetsuits and clothing.  Simply put, Kaha Nalu Hawaii will create original products to raise your standards in regards to your bodysurfing equipment.

By contributing to our campaign, you are helping us progress the art and are getting in on the ground level of a grass-roots movement of a local hawaiian business that could grow into the first international bodysurfing brand ever!
   What We Need & What You Get

With our Indiegogo campaign we are attempting to create a spark in the global bodysurfing community that will hopefully lead to a huge fire.  We normally have problems with hand-outs unless they are for a really good cause.  And yes, this happens to be a great cause and you get some really cool rewards in return in addition to our deepest gratitude.  Our initial goal of raising $18,000 is to merely cover all start-up costs and begin limited run productions until we get a stronger foothold.  Our dream goal is to raise closer to $48,000 but we are willing to work slowly and diligently for as long as it takes.  We really want to start off on the right foot and if we do exceed our goal, then we have some exciting plans to take it to the next level but first let's talk about our reward system so many graciously donated to and what you get for your hard-earned money you supported Kaha Nalu Hawaii with. 


Out of respect, we reached out to many bodysurfing legends and explained our reasoning and goals for Kaha Nalu Hawaii and to see if we were in the right track.  Remarkably, every single one came back in utter support.  In fact, they all offered up amazing donations for the bodysurfing community.  So whether you are the greatest bodysurfer of all-time or a nervous grom about to go for their first swim , we thank you in all advance.  We cannot make this possible without everybody's support and we will recognize and reward all of our backers, regardless of donation amount.  Please remember, we tried to figure out a breakdown that will stoke out all supporter yet still raise as much funds as we can.  Hopefully, you agree.

I am a co-founder of the solar-powered musical environmental activism project called Solar Punch.  We perform to inform - about the environment, about sustainable living, about organic agriculture, about solutions to climate challenges and many other concepts regarding mindfulness and the planet. Our group has had important, eye-opening tours of India since our participation in the ground-breaking 2009 Climate Solutions Road Tour. On one such tour in November 2011, we visited the Indian state of Jammu & Kashmir. Our hosts, Reetu Asrani & Owais Raheem of IYCN J&K, shared with us much of their incredible environmental activism efforts in this remote region of the Indian subcontinent.One particular effort they have embarked upon, and now in their fourth year, is the 'greening up' of the Amarnath Yatra.The Amarnath Yatra is one of the holiest of Hindu pilgrimages and in the six week period of time that it is open to Yatris (pilgrims), usually during the summer months of July and August, several hundred thousand devout Hindus make their way to the Amarnath cave.The impact that this many people has upon the fragile Himalayan landscape is striking and noticeable. Along with the Yatris come food vendors, novelty vendors, lots of garbage and - of course - enormous amounts of single-use plastic water bottles.There is no facility to capture and cart the waste off-sight so it usually collects in large piles along the trail itself as well as at the base camps and the surrounding area.During 2013's Yatra, Reetu and Owais installed several water purification units and encouraged shop keepers and pilgrims alike to fill reusable water bottles from the units, reducing the plastic bottle waste and providing clean, safe water from a secure source.We need to install water purification units.This year, the team wants to install more than 30 units, covering most of the base camps the Yatris muster at before making the walk / climb to the cave with the aspect of Shiva visible in the form of giant blue ice formation.We in Solar Punch are trying to raise funds for two of these units.  Reetu and Owais from IYCN J&K have no particular fund or capital to work with and have only gotten this far by the kindness of investors and people like us, making small offerings when we can.Each unit costs roughly $2,000 USD. Our campaign is seeking a few hundred dollars past that to compensate for the various processing fees and the perks we'd like to offer our supporters.Funding Breakdown
$4000 gets two water purification units ($2000 per unit) 
$500 will offset the processing fees and cost of the perks we are offering for generous funders.
One fun perk is a 3/4 scale custom painted guitar, signed by the Solar Punch team!
If we don't hit our goal, any funds we do collect will still go directly to the IYCN J&K team with a mandate that the funds be applied to the cost of water units..
The impacts from this effort...
Help reduce waste and contribute to the overall health of the ecology of this incredible natural resource.
Reinforce the essential connection to the natural world that is embedded within the Hindu philosophies.
Empower 'ordinary' citizens with responsible choices and embrace the larger, needed discussion about how every one of our 'footfalls' impacts the world around us.
Build a consensus on best practices for the ongoing Amarnath Yatra experience, ensuring a positive journey for future Yatris.
Reduce the overall use of single-use plastic water bottles and encourage deeper consideration for water itself. The water purification unit initiative is one of several strategies that Reetu and Owais have taken up.

Education Committee, Inc. is a small group of former ACORN members who have
joined together as volunteers working to bring GREEN to our communities in
Boston, Massachusetts. In July of 2010 we began providing GREEN information via
our Low Carbon workshops; Energy Fairs; Spring Plantings and more. We were
approved for our Tax-Exempt (501c3) status in November of 2012.</span></p>
<p><b>Director Owen Toney: </b><br/>My personal interests in
community organizing, climate change, anthropology and improving conditions in
Africa along with having family friends from and in Liberia led us to start the
Sustainable Development for Liberia project.</p>
<p><b>What's happening:</b><br/>Less than 20% of people in
Liberia have access to electricity. Unemployment is over 90%. Many Liberians
with access to electricity run generators burning polluting unsustainable
fossil fuels to produce their electricity. With Liberia rebuilding, there is an
opportunity for us (you and I) to help them use GREEN technology and techniques
to rebuild in a sustainable way.</p>
<p><b>Phase I</b></p><p><b>Teaching Solar - Creating Careers:</b> <br/>We have engaged
Dr. Richard Komp a world renowned solar pioneer, inventor and teacher to hold a
workshop on solar panels in Monrovia, Liberia. Twenty-five (25) workers will be
taught to Design, Assemble, Install, Maintain and Repair (DAIMR) solar
Photovoltaic panels and other devices. This training will lead to permanent
careers providing the income to support the graduates and their families.
Additionally, these new Solar Technicians will be able to bring electricity to
their friends and neighbors throughout Liberia. The solar technicians will work
in the capital city Monrovia for six months. They will then go back to their
home counties and teach local people to become Solar Technicians. This will
provide jobs and keep the knowledge sustainable.<br/>
Often, well intentioned International Development projects break down and end
up as giant paper weights because the local people aren’t taught to care for
them. Using DAIMR for development projects keeps them sustainable as local
people can keep them going.</p>
<p><b>The money is for:</b><br/>We need your financial
support to send Dr. Komp to Liberia and to pay for materials the Solar Tech’s
will use to get started deploying solar panels. Some fragile materials can be
brought via airlines. Bulkier items must be placed in a container and shipped
via ocean freight. And all of that needs to be paid for.</p>
<p>Whether or not we meet our
goal in this crowdfunding campaign, all funds raised will still go towards
accomplishing our mission of creating sustainable jobs for Liberians </p>
<p><b>Why it will work:</b><br/>While the Green Neighbors
have held a number of successful GREEN events in Boston, this will be our first
international effort. We chose Dr. Komp (<a href=""http://www.mainesolar.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.mainesolar.org</a>) for his many years
of experience teaching solar around the world. His experience will ensure that
the solar Technicians are skilled and ready to improve their country.</p>
<p><b>Your financial support:</b><br/>Success breeds success!
Your support will mean the difference in making this Phase I of our project a
success and our ability to have additional programs such as biodigestors;
micro-hydroelectric; Aquaponics and more. <b>Your
donations are tax-deductible</b>.<br/>
Would your group, church; fraternal; social, etc., organization be willing to sponsor a
worker for the workshop? A donation of $1,000.00 will provide for the Solar
Technicians full kit of equipment and cover expenses the training period and a
little beyond.</p>
<p><b>How else you can help:</b><br/>In addition to financial
support, we need you to help us get the word out about our Sustainable
Development for Liberia project. Please use Indiegogo’s tools for outreach. But
especially, your help calling your friends and family and asking them to consider
supporting the project will be invaluable! That personal touch makes a huge
difference.</p>
<p><b>The Future is GREENer:</b><br/>Last but not least, we
plan to introduce many other GREEN technologies and techniques to Liberia. If
you have GREEN skills and/or knowledge that you think may be helpful in
bringing sustainable tech in a DAIMR way to our friends in Liberia, please

<p class=""Default"">Can you imagine more than 100 children singing ‘I Am The Future?’ Or dancing to ‘Up Your Watershed?’ Or creating eco-art masterpieces? Or picking organic fruit and veggies to prepare for each other? That’s the power of <a href=""http://www.freshoutlookfoundation.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ECO-BLAST Kids’ Camp &amp; Concert</a>! </p>
<p class=""Default"">ECO-BLAST is designed and delivered by eco-education experts to connect children with nature and each other through song, dance, art, and interactive play. More than 100 kids ages 5-12 will learn and perform ecological songs written and taught by the <a href=""http://www.artistresponseteam.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Artist Response Team</a>. They’ll express their thoughts and feelings about the environment through dance, and they’ll create eco-art that reflects their unique interpretation of our natural world. Campers will also learn how to be part of the solution rather than part of the problem by saving water and energy and reducing waste. And they’ll visit local urban gardens and make soups and salads for each other with the produce they pick.</p>
<p class=""Default"">The week culminates in a concert where campers will showcase their songs, dances, and art projects. Local eco-related non-profit organizations will be invited to share information about their services as part of the event.</p>
<p class=""Default""><strong> </strong></p>
<p class=""Default""><strong>WHY DO WE NEED ECO-BLAST?</strong></p>
<p class=""Default"">Research shows that children who interact regularly with nature are happier, healthier, and more likely to help protect our precious planet than those who don’t. Why then, are children disappearing from the outdoors at a rate that would put them at the top of any endangered species list? Experts suggest that urbanization is the primary culprit. Studies prove that kids who are disconnected from nature are often isolated, sedentary, and reliant on technology for information and entertainment. This ‘nature deficit disorder’ can cause loneliness, obesity, addictions to electronic devices, and a lack of appreciation for the wonder of nature.</p>
<p class=""Default"">But when nature is celebrated through eco-education and enhanced through the sensory stimulation provided by music, movement, and creative expression, children learn to connect with themselves, nature, and each other. In the short term, the outcomes are magical and memorable; in the long term, the impacts are meaningful and momentous!</p>
<p class=""Default""> </p>
<p class=""Default""><strong>WHY SHOULD YOU BE AN ECO-BLAST BOOSTER?</strong></p>
<p class=""Default"">One person really can make a difference, especially a youngster who’s passionate about change! Typically, when children know better, they do better. Therefore, their ECO-BLAST experiences will be reflected in behaviour change that impacts them as individuals, their families, their neighbourhoods, and their communities. Whether you give a little or a lot, your contribution will surely increase community well-being now and well into the future. And if you send a kid to camp through a scholarship of $129, you’ll be exposing him/her to an experience the family mighty not otherwise be able to afford.</p>
<p class=""Default""> </p>
<p class=""Default""><strong>WHERE WILL YOUR MONEY GO?</strong></p>
<p class=""Default"">The ECO-BLAST budget is $30,000, which covers event expenses such as instruction, food, transportation, art materials, and promotion. We intend to raise one-third of the needed revenue through camp registrations, one-third through grants and sponsorships, and the final third through this crowdfunding campaign. Some of the crowdfunding revenue will be used for scholarships to cover camp registration for children who might not otherwise be able to attend. We’re aiming for 10 scholarships at $129 each. If we raise more than $10,000 through this campaign, we will offer more scholarships and guarantee that all food is organic and locally produced.</p>

To save these endangered species, we must learn about them. As part of our virtual community, Centro de Rescate Las Pumas and Panthera (organizations dedicated to the preservation of wild cats) have worked together with us collaborating with a weekly blog.

As part of our virtual community, Centro de Rescate Las Pumas and Panthera (organizations dedicated to the preservation of wild cats) have worked together with us collaborating with a weekly blog. With the intention to exchange vital information among themselves and anyone interested in their work. Of the 37 wild felines in the world, 12 of them inhabit the American continent, and six of them live in Costa Rica, all of whichare currently endangered species.
As we successfully launched GNJaguar, the Costa Rican government declared the National Day of Wild Felines on July 4th.

What you’ll help us achieve
After acknowledging the importance and success of this interactive guide, we have decided that we're gonna make it global! With your help, GNJaguar seeks to expand to create the first wild feline guide to educate the public of the current state of feline populations around the world. 
 
GreenNoise is committed to wild feline conservation in Costa Rica. With your contribution, we will be able to expand our efforts globally and reach out to the public in order to inform them on the current condition of wild feline populations all around the world and the conservation efforts made by non-profit and for profit entities.  
What We Need & What You Get
With your valuable contribution, we aim to collect $35,000, which will fund the development of an educational guide of the 37 wild feline species. This interactive platform will be complete with audio, videos, and high quality photographs, and will include special information on each specie.   
What You’ll Get
This educational guide will be offered in over 10 different languages, and available as an App for Android, iPhone and iPad. We will all have valuable information in the palm of your hand and that alone can make a difference on the conservation of these endangered animals!
If we are unable to reach our goal, we will put your valued contributions towards creating the guide and including as many wild feline species as possible. 
The Impact
Our goal is to make a positive impact on wild feline conservation through education.  Our educational guide will encourage the public to learn about these creatures in a fun and accessible way. making human coexistence with nature, a positive impact.  
GNJaguar is the first platform in Costa Rica, to function as a link between organizations involved in wild feline conservation. We will continue to look for and establish relationships between organizations around the world that are concerned with feline conservation.  
Our first platform, GreenNoise, has become a successful conservation effort, where we have brought the sounds of nature to the world, and have partnered with Costa Rican flora & fauna organizations, as well as governmental entities, to share the beauty of undisturbed and protected sites.  
We have shared the essentiality of the Costa Rican rainforest to people concerned with their daily hectic lives. 
Our web platform, GNJaguar now functions as an educational website for people interested in our efforts and people desiring to learn about the wild felines of Costa Rica. The GNJaguar Blog is the only site of its kind, where researchers, students and organizations involved in preserving wild feline species, exchange ideas and developments.

<h3>Dear Family &amp; Friends,</h3>
<p>I am currently inspired and excited by my acceptance and upcoming participation in this <a href=""http://www.kleiwerks.org/natural-building-school/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">5-Month Natural Building Apprenticeship</a> by Kleiwerks International, a woman-run organization that focuses on teaching WOMEN to become leaders in the natural building movement. I'd love to <strong>invite you to support me on my journey ahead</strong>, and I thank you in advance for anything you are able to offer.  This means so much to me and I look forward to using what I learn in ways that help to heal our planet...</p>
<p>As many of you know, I have spent the last four years in the Peruvian Amazon, working with indigenous people around environmental and social justice issues. While it has not always been easy I have learned a great deal about the world, myself, and my potential to be of service to others.</p>
<p>One of the most exciting parts of my time here has been an initiative to build structures (benches, school houses, toilets) out of plastic bottles filled with trash -- an initiative that provides communities with free locally available building materials, while reducing the growing waste problem in the Amazon. It is a very exciting initiative that is now taking off. (See my <a href=""http://alianzaarkana.org/media-room/blog-latest-news/entry/building-with-bottles-in-nueva-ahuaypa"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">blog</a> and a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/AlianzaArkana"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video interview</a> about the program)</p>
<p>However, being a woman in an extremely male-dominant culture has been very difficult for me. Not only for the way it has directly affected me, but also seeing how this oppression has shaped the young girls and women here. (You can read a <a href=""http://welcometotheselva.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">blog entry</a> of mine about this here). <strong>As a result, I have become increasingly involved in initiatives to <a href=""http://alianzaarkana.org/media-room/blog-latest-news/entry/girls-for-the-world-empowering-indigenous-girls-in-the-peruvian-amazon"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">empower women and girls.</a></strong></p>
<p>So you can imagine my utter delight when I stumbled across this initiative that works with women to learn how to build using naturally-occurring resources – a union of the two themes that I have been most passionate about. <strong>I knew right away that this was something I had to be a part of.</strong></p>
<p>Following my Apprenticeship, I plan to work in the Americas to empower women, restore building practices that work in harmony with nature, and build community. <strong>My first project will be to build student housing for indigenous scholarship students in Peru. This project will not only utilize natural materials, but also the plastic bottle approach that has worked so well for us until now, only without cement!</strong></p>
<p>However, I need to raise $4,000 toward my participation in the Apprenticeship. <strong>Would you be willing to help support my journey into this empowering movement by making a contribution? </strong>Any amount, from modest to eye-popping, is welcome and so appreciated!</p>
<p>And in appreciation of your support, I will give those who donate $25 or more an <strong>online photo album</strong> of the 3 month process. Donations of $125 or more will receive a <strong>beautiful</strong> <strong>tapestry</strong> made by a Shipibo women’s artisan group that I have been working with here. And for donations of over $500, we can talk about how I can use my new-found skills to <strong>make something for you out of….DIRT!</strong> (from small decorations for your house, to perhaps something larger)</p>
<p><strong>I thank you for support, and am so excited to share this journey with you!</strong></p>
<p>Love and thanks,</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What's up?</h3>
<p>Like many people in Ottawa, I first heard about the risk of the Tar Sands coming to Canada's capital from an Ecology Ottawa email on 25 June:</p>
<blockquote>
<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;""><i><strong>""It has just been reported that TransCanada Corp is hoping to build a massive $5 billion pipeline that will transport 850,000 barrels a day of tar sands oil through the south end of the City of Ottawa and across the Rideau River.</strong> The plan is to retrofit a natural gas pipeline into a pipeline that will carry crude oil from Alberta’s tar sands to the East Coast of Canada and they want to run the pipeline through our city!""</i> </span><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">- Ecology Ottawa</b>
</blockquote>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;""><b>This is a Terrible, No Good, Very Bad Idea.</b></span></p>
<p></p></span><p></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I'm a singer-songwriter called <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/VelaCatalyst"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Vela</a>. I'm also a PhD Candidate in Environmental Education name<a href=""http://juliecomber.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Julie</a>. As an Artist-Activist, I wanted to help stop this proposed Energy East Pipeline. While sitting in Ecology Ottawa's first public forum about the pipeline on 15 July, I was already writing a song. Then it was announced the twitter hashtag for this campaign is #TarFree613. I thought, ""That's a great song title!"" </span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">A few days later while </span>making<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> curry for <a href=""http://www.kevinguerette.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kevin Guerette</a> and Rebecca Lantz, we jammed on the #TarFree613 Song. In walked Fedor Ilitchev, who just happens to make videos. Kevin just happens to be a music producer and gifted guitarist. Rebecca just happens to be awesome. We realized that in that one kitchen, we had all the ingredients for an </span>awesome<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> project: to record the song and make a music video that will support Ecology Ottawa, The Council of Canadians, <a href=""http://350ottawa.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">350 Ottawa</a>, and other fabulous organizations, to help get the message out. Well, all the </span>ingredients<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> except one: cash. So a week later, we shot the live demo of the song for this Indiegogo funding campaign (the Pitch Video, above).</span></p>
<p>The Tar Sands extraction sites are ugly wounds on Mother Earth. Our Resistance is Beautiful. We need to say ""NO!"" to the Tar Sands on every front, in every community, in every way we can. Communities need to support each other to be strong enough to shut down the Tar Sands. The #TarFree613 Song is part of this creative, collaborative resistance.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>More About the Vision for the Video</h3>
<p>Please note the Pitch Video, above, shows what we can do with no funding, and no time. All we had was ourselves, the Mud Lake dock, and a video camera. OK, and a beaver, who graced us with cameo appearances. </p>
<p>Imagine what we can do with funding, time, and most importantly, YOU! We'd like the video to be collaborative. Here are just the broad strokes of our plan for the #TarFree613 Video, (the timing is using the above Pitch Video): <b>1</b>. 0:00-24: Begin as a parody of a News Report (the ""finding out"" part of the Song, opening that email about the Pipeline). <b>2</b>. 0:24-0:36: First ""TarFree613"" chorus, maybe have similar images for the chorus each time. For example, we want to shoot on the old pipeline that TransCanada wants to retrofit! <b>3</b>. 0:37-0:48 ""No to this Pipeline"" part - show footage of peaceful resistance so far. <b>4</b>. 1:01- 1:23 ""We don't want"" part - footage that illustrates all that we don't want (Eg. We don't want... pipeline spills, dead wildlife, corporate greed, etc). <b>5</b>. 1:24- 1:30 ""Bling part"" - we wear gold bellbottom pantsuits and so much Shiny Stuff, it will make Lady Gaga blush. We don't need Stuff to be happy! <b>6</b>. 1:31- 2:08: Now this is your chance to shine!!! <b>For the ""What we want"" part, we'd like to show YOU and what YOU want our future to be like!</b> And pretty much up until the end of the song, its about focusing on the beautiful, fair, loving future we want, to leave folks feeling inspired and uplifted. And determined to have a TarFree Future! </p>
<p>Please feel free to post feedback, comments, and ideas about the video in the comment section of the campaign, on the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/567955156600881"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">FB</a> Event Wall, or message <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/vela.music.project"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Vela</a>. If you'd like to be in the video, please email vela.music.project@gmail.com. There will be more details after the funding campaign about collaborating with us. </p>
<p></p>
<h3 style=""font-weight: bold;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need about $600 to pull this off. And YOU can be in our music video!</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Budget</b></p>
<ul>
<li>$350 for studio recording, mixing, and mastering (by Kevin), includes studio rental. To produce radio quality recording to post on bandcamp, ReverbNation, and put on the radio</li>
<li>$100 honorarium to videographer (Fedor), to create video to post on youtube &amp; vimeo</li>
<li>$100 for props, travel, or other unforeseen costs to make video</li>
<li>$50 (approx.) for Indiegogo and PayPal Fees</li>
<li>Total: $600</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Perky Perks</b></p>
<p>This is no ordinary music video. This will be co-created with our community! Co-created with YOU. The song invites you to think about the future YOU want. When we first launched, we though a fun Perk would be that if you pitch us $10, we'd include a video clip of you holding a sign that says ""We want [insert the wonderful thing you want]"". Or holding a ""#TarFree613"" sign. But as we got more and more excited about having lots and lots of people in the video, we realized we want EVERYONE to be included. We want this video to show the beautiful and inspiring diversity of people working together for the future we want. A TarFree Future! So we do not want money to prevent anyone from participating. We also realized we will continue the call out for folks to be in the video after this funding campaign is over. And it wouldn't be fair to have some folks pay and some not pay. So, instead, please make sure we're fully funded so we can pull this off! Give what you can, and share share share! If you're part of an organization or business, let them know that for $50, individuals or organizations will be listed as a supporter, with a link to their website and logo in video credits, video description, and on the song description (on bandcamp &amp; ReverbNation).</p>
<b>What if we don't reach our funding goal?</b></span><p></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">If we don't reach our entire goal, we will all cry. Please don't make us cry. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">And through our tears, we'll still do our best with whatever funds we get.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>What if we blow past our funding goal?</b></span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">If we are blessed with abundance, we will: First, see if the extra money can be further invested into the project (for promotion, </span>entering<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> the song in songwriting contests, or making an even more compelling video). Then second, use the money for more Artivist projects, and donate to local organizations that are working on this issue. </span></p>
<p><b>Financial<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> Transparency</span></b></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We will produce a </span>financial<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> report of our actual expenses that will be posted and made available to anyone who requests it. We appreciate your trust and will be completely financially transparent with you. We're also curious how much this will really cost, </span>because<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> we want to do it again!</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Keep Tar Sands Crude out of the 613 area code. Contribute to the overall creative resistance to make the Tar Sands unprofitable. Have lots of fun doing so.</p>

This is a Terrible, No Good, Very Bad Idea.

I'm a singer-songwriter called Vela. I'm also a PhD Candidate in Environmental Education nameJulie. As an Artist-Activist, I wanted to help stop this proposed Energy East Pipeline.

If you'd like to be in the video, please email vela.music.project@gmail.com. There will be more details after the funding campaign about collaborating with us. 

What We Need & What You Get
We need about $600 to pull this off. And YOU can be in our music video!

Budget

$350 for studio recording, mixing, and mastering (by Kevin), includes studio rental. To produce radio quality recording to post on bandcamp, ReverbNation, and put on the radio
$100 honorarium to videographer (Fedor), to create video to post on youtube & vimeo
$100 for props, travel, or other unforeseen costs to make video
$50 (approx.) for Indiegogo and PayPal Fees
Total: $600



Perky Perks
This is no ordinary music video. This will be co-created with our community! Co-created with YOU. The song invites you to think about the future YOU want. When we first launched, we though a fun Perk would be that if you pitch us $10, we'd include a video clip of you holding a sign that says ""We want [insert the wonderful thing you want]"". Or holding a ""#TarFree613"" sign. But as we got more and more excited about having lots and lots of people in the video, we realized we want EVERYONE to be included. We want this video to show the beautiful and inspiring diversity of people working together for the future we want. A TarFree Future! So we do not want money to prevent anyone from participating. We also realized we will continue the call out for folks to be in the video after this funding campaign is over. And it wouldn't be fair to have some folks pay and some not pay. So, instead, please make sure we're fully funded so we can pull this off! Give what you can, and share share share! If you're part of an organization or business, let them know that for $50, individuals or organizations will be listed as a supporter, with a link to their website and logo in video credits, video description, and on the song description (on bandcamp & ReverbNation).
What if we don't reach our funding goal?
If we don't reach our entire goal, we will all cry. Please don't make us cry. And through our tears, we'll still do our best with whatever funds we get.
What if we blow past our funding goal?
If we are blessed with abundance, we will: First, see if the extra money can be further invested into the project (for promotion, entering the song in songwriting contests, or making an even more compelling video). Then second, use the money for more Artivist projects, and donate to local organizations that are working on this issue. 
Financial Transparency
We will produce a financial report of our actual expenses that will be posted and made available to anyone who requests it. We appreciate your trust and will be completely financially transparent with you. We're also curious how much this will really cost, because we want to do it again!



The Impact
Keep Tar Sands Crude out of the 613 area code. Contribute to the overall creative resistance to make the Tar Sands unprofitable. Have lots of fun doing so.

<p>The rest will have to be raised by book club members selling their organs on the black market. Please, don't let that happen.</p>

<p>Under the duress of economic pressure, the Quiché Maya, who have held the forest communally for generations, are beginning to not only harvest the ancient trees but survey and sell parcels of the land to support their needs.  Loggers and speculators are lining up to buy, but we are fighting on behalf of the forest and wildlife. We work with indigenous communities to plant food trees, creating economic independence, and helping them to conserve and protect their sacred forest.  As land rights come up for sale we are stepping in to purchase them to establish the new Cerro el Amay Cloud Forest Preserve. This will preserve the ancient forest for generations to come.  </p>

Deep in the Guatemalan highlands where the Quiche forest Maya  live, an incredible discovery was recently made: Cerro el Amay. 

This mist-shrouded paradise is the largest unprotected virgin (old growth) cloud forest in northern Central America.  Amazingly, this forest was completely unknown to science until recently, and exploration has only just begun.  This rich and unique forest has already yielded many species potentially new to science in our first explorations.  Cerro el Amay contains vast systems of caves with underground streams, stalactites, stalagmites and other cave formations.  Massive sinkholes harbor unique ecosystems with unique fauna and flora.   With the rich and ancient history of these Mayan lands, there is no telling what mysteries and adventures will unfold in our February-March 2015 Eco-Adventure into the heart of the forest, sinkholes and caves!  You can be a part of this adventure; see the perks below!
Under the duress of economic pressure, the Quiché Maya, who have held the forest communally for generations, are beginning to not only harvest the ancient trees but survey and sell parcels of the land to support their needs.  Loggers and speculators are lining up to buy, but we are fighting on behalf of the forest and wildlife. We work with indigenous communities to plant food trees, creating economic independence, and helping them to conserve and protect their sacred forest.  As land rights come up for sale we are stepping in to purchase them to establish the new Cerro el Amay Cloud Forest Preserve. This will preserve the ancient forest for generations to come.  
Are you ready to join us on the adventure of a lifetime?  
Time is of the essence.  We need your help to make this Preserve a reality.

Welcome to the team!

The CFCI Board


Who we are:


The
Cloud Forest Conservation Initiative (CFCI) is a nonprofit organization, based in the US and Guatemala, working with US-based, Conservation Imaging Inc. (CI),
a 501(c)3 nonprofit, for the preservation and conservation of the largest
unprotected Tropical Montane Cloud Forest in northern Central America.  This forested jewel, Cerro el Amay, is
located in Quiché Department, in the karstic Guatemalan highlands, specifically
in the Sierra de Chama, and contains
more than 19,000 hectares (46,950 acres) of ancient, pristine cloud forest and nearly
3,000 hectares (7,415 acres) of undeveloped, second growth.  This unique and sensitive habitat is home to
multiple threatened and endangered species, as well as species new to science,
and is home to several communities of indigenous Maya.  





Current Threats: 

The integrity and pristine quality
of Cerro el Amay is threatened by
numerous environmental and physical impacts. 
These include but are not limited to illegal logging, poaching,
encroaching slash-and-burn agriculture, road building, climate change, and
unsustainable development.  



Objectives:

Establish a majestic cloud forest preserve in the heart of the Guatemalan highlands through direct acquisitions, land agreements, and conservation easements.
Work in concert with indigenous communities to create sustainable economic and ecologically-sensitive development projects that will enable the communities to thrive.
Spearhead reforestation through our Macadamia Conservation Exchange (MCE) program.
Create a center for biological & environmental research, eco-tourism, and cultural heritage.
Conduct biological inventories and karst/cave surveys.  



What We Need 






Ads by PassShowAd Options

 Money and people.  Our crowd-sourcing campaign funds will help CFCI:



Identify and target parcels for reforestation.
Collaborate with indigenous partners to implement the Macadamia-Conservation Exchange.
Train local Mayan guides to lead their own eco-adventures in the cloud forest.
Install greywater (domestic effluent) treatment in headwater villages.
Conduct threatened and endangered species surveys.
Inventory the cave system.
Negotiate the protection and purchase of land rights.

Specifically, $12,000 USD will pay for materials to train Mayan guides in climbing/rappelling, safety training, greywater systems, environmental monitoring, trail maintenance/design, macadamia trees, hand tools, and personnel transportation costs.  Any funding received in excess of our goal will be applied directly towards land preservation through purchase of land rights.  We also want to see you in the cloud forest.  Come and join us! 




What You Get (Perks):
$15 ~ We will give you an awesome virtual high-five and plant a tree in your honor (personalized with your name on a metal name tag) at Cerro el Amay restoration sites.
$25 ~ Yes! Another virtual high-five, a tree planted in your honor with a metal name tag, and a copy of board member Rob Lenfestey's new CD of world music.
$50 ~ Stepping it up! Now you get a virtual high-five, a tree planted in your honor with a metal name tag, and a CFCI tea/coffee mug.



$100 ~ A round figure! You'll receive a virtual high-five, a tree planted in your honor with a metal name tag, and a cotton canvas CFCI shopping bag.



$150 ~ Thanks! For this level of contribution you get a virtual high-five, a tree planted in your honor with a metal name tag, and a signed and glass/oak framed high resolution photograph from the cloud forest.  Choices will be emailed to you.
$200 ~ Take the next step! This will award you with a virtual high-five, a tree planted in your honor with a metal name tag, and a unique Mayan weave (table runner or wall hanging). The image below is just an example of a table runner.



$350 ~ May the forest be with you!  This level of gift wins you a virtual high-five, a tree planted in your honor with a metal name tag, and a Mayan basket set made of mimbre root fibers, a species of arboreal Monstera plant that can only be found growing in the cloud forest. We are the only source of these baskets, which are hand made by Juan Chivalan and his wife, Maria at one of our Conservation Communities in the cloud forest!



$2,500 ~ Making things happen!  For this level of donation, you'll receive a virtual high-five, a tree planted in your honor with a metal name tag, and a seat on the February 27 - March 11, 2015 cloud forest eco-adventure with board members and indigenous Mayan guides.  This perk can be gifted to another person in your honor.
http://inchantedjourneys.com/portfolio/guatemala-2015/



$10,000 ~ World changer!  For this level of donation, we will provide, a dozen trees planted in your honor with personalized metal name tags, and an all-expenses paid trip to the Cerro el Amay cloud forest led by one or two of our board members, as well as our friends in the indigenous communities.  This trip comes with expert interpretation of the cloud forest environment.



$14,500 ~ A gift that will endure by conserving 111 acres of virgin cloud forest!  With this level of donation, not only do you receive two virtual high-fives, but we will also plant fifty trees in your name, with metal name tags on each one, but more importantly, we will be able to purchase a derecho (111 acres) to add to the cloud forest preserve now being managed by CFCI.

All donations will be acknowledged on our website.  All donations are tax-deductible, and all donations over $50 will receive
a vellum-parchment letter of thanks from the Executive Director of CFCI.  All funds raised in this crowd-sourcing campaign will go towards CFCI and the preservation of Cerro el Amay.   The Impact CFCI is creating a primal cloud forest preserve which is not only a biological haven, but also serves as a headwaters region for many communities and municipalities. Some lands have already been preserved through philanthropic donations, biological studies, and conservation agreements.  Cerro el Amay contains many endangered and threatened species.  Some of the rare species known to exist there include;  
Black-handed spider monkey, 
Guatemalan black howler monkey, 
Resplendent Quetzal, among the most beautiful birds in the world.
Highland Guan (Penelopina nigra), and 
The Guatemalan spike-thumb frog.  
A terrestrial crab that may be new to science, living in the mountains.


CFCI's efforts will also help improve the indigenous Mayan communities, by providing the people with ecologically-sensitive economic developments.  Our current developments include:

Planting specialty crops that curb poverty--especially macadamia and cacao trees.
Helping the Maya enroll their lands into the Forestry Incentives Program whereby they can receive a cash incentive for every year they conserve the forest.
Improving water quality with domestic greywater treatment systems.

Increasing local revenue from indigenous craft sales through direct marketing.
Facilitating eco-tourism via cloud forest tours for international travelers.

Risks & Challenges  This project requires a multi-tiered effort on the behalf of the cloud forest and the indigenous people.  We have to move quickly and effectively because chain saws are running, and most of Cerro el Amay remains unprotected.  Together we can work to establish this region as a preserve.

<h3><b>The Water Crisis</b></h3>
<p>Sit beneath the trees, they will impart
unto you their wisdom.  Walk amongst the granite, hear it cry out with thirst.</p>
<p>On one of my fall trips in the Sierra this year I came away with
that line.  If you have spent any time in the mountains over the past several years, I have a feeling that you will know
how right that statement feels, and moreover, how it holds true.</p>
<p>It is no secret that we are in the midst of
an incredibly elongated drought in the west, but people tend to forget...the mountains
need water too.  With an increase in overall temperatures and years of
below-normal snow-pack, the mountains are thirsty.</p>
<p>It speaks to our overall disconnect with
the land...we have forgotten where our water really comes from.  I have
news for you, it doesn't come from the damned tap.  Water, the very
essence of life, is quite literally born in the mountains.  Until we
recognize this, until we see the water crisis for what it truly is, until we
start turning on the taps and nothing comes out, well, we are pretty much
screwed.  </p>
<p>Think about it, while more and more water
can always be 'tapped' and taken away from the mountains, it can hardly be
replaced by anything but the forces of nature. Given the recent history, and
the years of drought, it's time to start hedging our bet...  If our
mountains are to stand up to the test of time, the test of our time that is,
well, it's time we stand up for them.  </p>

<h3>My Background</h3>
<p>Roughly 4 years ago, I
walked into the Superstition mountains on my very first backpacking trip.
 It sucked...I was way out of my league.  Hell, I even had to carry
my 6-month old puppy a solid 2 miles, if not more, just to get out of the mountains.
On that same trip, I walked out of the mountains a changed man. The seeds of
wanderlust were planted...I was in love.  </p>
<p>It would be almost another full year before
setting out into the wild again, but when I did...I found that the pull and
overall allure of the outdoors were no longer the same. The affinities I had
with the mountains had grown...much more than I could have imagined.</p>
<p>I made the decision that I was going to
arrange my life around backpacking on the weekends.  In the early days,
this meant undergoing such extreme measures as running a clothesline inside my
apartment just so I could spend the electricity savings on gear, or food, or
gas just to get to a trip.  I was hooked...like the truest addict that
ever was.  I was addicted to the mountains.</p>
<p>Since then, I have walked, traversed,
slid-down, and/or otherwise experienced many more mountain ranges throughout
the west.  As I experienced and witnessed
more, my wanderlust only grew.  I had to see more. I had to experience
more.  To do this, I even created my own backpacking group on meetup.com
(see <a href=""http://meetup.com/Arizona-Epic-Adventures-Backpacking/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://meetup.com/Arizona-Epic-Adventures-Backpacking/</a>)
right about a year and half ago.  In the
past 52 weeks alone, I have racked up more than 1,000 miles...and more than 700
miles the year before that.  </p>
<p>It is those very experiences that have since shaped me and my mission.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<h3><b>The Money </b></h3>
<p>I would love to be able to start out
on this journey on my own terms, with my own means.  Unfortunately, that just isn’t possible.  Back in early October I lost my job in
corporate America.  I had contracted
pneumonia during an almost 50 mile loop in the Sierra near Mt. Whitney.  Unluckily for me, I did not have the
sick-time and I was subsequently canned. 
</p>
<p>Although it hasn’t been exactly
easy, I know I am on the right path.  I
can only describe it as a feeling of being called on to hike, a feeling of
being chosen, rightly or not, to give voice to the mountains. Help me raise my
voice!</p>

<p>Giving back from the get-go…  A secondary, but no-less important aspect of
my campaign, is doing whatever I can to support those who already make things
happen...giving back to those who already promote or otherwise work to engage
people. </p>
<p>To support the organizations that do
the work that literally supports my boots on the ground by creating,
developing, and maintaining the trails I will travel, 50%  will be donated directly to the trail organizations. 
For each dollar raised by the campaign, </p>
<ul>
<li>$0.10 will be donated to the Pacific Crest Trail
     Association</li>
<li>$0.10 will be donated to the Arizona Trail Association</li>
<li>$0.10 will be donated to the Pacific Northwest Trail
     Association</li>
<li>$0.10 will be donated to the Grand Enchantment Trail</li>
<li>$0.10 will be donated to the Continental Divide Trail
     Coalition</li>
</ul>
<p>Only $0.50 of every dollar will
actually go to the ""me"" component of this Walking for Water epic
itself.  It means that if we hit our goal of $30,000, I will have the
$15,000 needed to complete the journey...the remaining $15,000 goes
directly to the beneficiaries outlined above.  *As a side-note, the trails
are already all in the loop and have granted me use of the applicable logos to
use in this campaign.</p>
<p><br/>
<b><span>Where the Money Goes</span></b><b> - </b><b>Gear</b></p>
<p>With a touch under 7,000 miles to
trek, gear and food will be my main expenses. While I am more-or-less geared up
to my friggin' ears, on a trip like this I am going to absolutely consume gear.
 Think of the Great Western Loop as the greatest endurance-testing stage
that has ever been set.  That said, if there are any gear companies that
would like to participate, and if you think your gear is up to such rigors (or
at least better than the other guys), well, let's do it!  ***Hint-hint
Asolo, Big Agnes, Black Diamond, Osprey, etc...  Given the fact that I
have most of my initial gear, I am going to allow for $2,000 for replacing gear
as I go.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Where the Money Goes</b><b> - </b><b>Food</b></p>
<p>Food by far will be my absolute
largest expenditure...  I am going to need to consume roughly 5,000 -
5,500 calories per day...every day...and that's in non-freezing, 'good'
weather.  For times that I encounter snow, I'm going to need to bump up my
caloric intake up to 7,000 calories per day.  So if I err on the side of
caution and anticipate 1/3 of my time will be in cold, snowy conditions (God I
hope not), then I have 104 days of 7,000 calories and 208 days of 5,000
calories (going on the low-end on this assumption), add some math to the
728,000 'cold-day calories' and 1,020,000 calories for 'normal-day calories',
and there you have it...just under 1.75 million calories...or right under $8,000
in food expenses alone. </p>
<p><b>Where the Money Goes – </b><b>Technology</b></p>
<p>Throughout the journey, I will be
maintaining a daily blog...  While there will undoubtedly be periods of 4,
5, or even 7 days with no reception to sync the posts, entries will be
completed daily, even if only extremely brief...without fail. </p>
<p>In addition to the blog, I'm going
to try and have a real-time tracker setup...  This way you can meet me out
on the trail, hopefully with some ice-cold beer!  ***Hint-hint to the two
breweries I am seeking sponsorship from - Sierra Nevada and the Arizona
Wilderness Brewing Co. After all, it just isn't possible to have great beer
without great water, it's only a natural fit!</p>
<p>Besides the blog I will be
maintaining, I will be taking photographs...good ones, and for that I need a good
camera.  After a visit to Tempe Camera a few weeks back, it looks like the
FujiFilm X-T1 is going to be the camera of choice.  The camera and two
lenses is going to cost $2200 (think that should include tax!)...  This
camera is pretty damned important to this trip, as I will be documenting this
trip as thoroughly and comprehensively as possible.  Plus, it's going to
allow me to sell prints as perks!</p>
<p><b>Where the Money Goes – </b><b>Other</b></p>
<p>After the above expense allocations
have been made, the remaining portions will go to overall trip execution…meaning
everything from gas money for hitches into towns, shipping &amp; logistical
expenses, cell-phone service (to allow the blog syncing when in areas of
reception), dog care expenses, etc. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>Risks, Challenges, Contingencies, &amp; Bonus Goals...</b></h3>
<p>The challenge
for us, well, the biggest challenge, is getting people to see how important the
land actually is and creating the ""GAS"" factor.  If we fail to
create the GAS factor then this is all for naught.  And no the GAS factor
is not some fancy-dancy new metric designed to analyze fracking efficiency, no
it is something much simpler...it is the Give-A-Shit factor.  </p>
<p>Bottom
line...if people don't or won't care (read: if people don't Give-A-Shit) about
the mountains and the waters that flow through them, then we're all screwed.
 That is why our biggest challenge is getting people to give a shit.</p>
<p>As far as
contingencies go, I don't have anything else...  I'm 34 years old, I'm
unemployed, I have no savings, and once I begin this journey, I will have
nowhere to come back to, yet...I believe in this.  I am literally giving
myself to this cause...there is no plan B.    </p>
<p>That said, if
you guys can help me give people GAS, and we reach our goals, well, I will take
care of the rest.  You see, this is going to work...I just know it is.
 If we do not reach the full fundraising goal, I will go through a
taking-stock phase and see what, if anything can be done to proceed.  The
split between the monies the trails receive and monies to finance the trip
applies in this case as well. </p>
<p>Ok, ok...there is always a plan B.  If we don't reach our goal, but still have a successful fundraiser,  we will push forward...just scaled back.  Chances are we will be able to do at least one of the trails.  Bottom line, even if we can't fund the full Great Western Loop, if we are to get our message out, if we are to help advocate for the mountains, we need to start somewhere.</p>
<p>........</p>
<p>If we surpass
all fundraising goals, the trail-organization and trip expenditures will stay
the same...yet there will be a bonus.  You see, there is a chance for
real, lasting, significant change here.  So what's the bonus?!?
 Well, any trip monies raised in excess of the needed $15,000 will go
towards our incorporation.  That's right, the birth of The Wanderlust
Objective non-profit.  Because this component is dependent on surpassing
our funding goals, I'm not going to divulge too much information on it...yet.
 </p>
<p>What I can say
is that the organization I want to create will  give voice to the
mountains, it will advocate for them on their behalf, it will foster a sense of
re-connection and re-engagement with the land, and (with work) will be almost
entirely self-supporting.  Now...who wouldn't want to be a part of that?
 </p>

<h3><b>Trip
Completion Timeline </b></h3>
<p>While I am well, well into the
mapping phase of my trip, I still have a lot of work to do.  That said, I
do have a rough time-frame of how long this trip will take.  Allowing
myself an overall, average pace of 22 miles per day, I am expecting to complete
the Great Western Loop in 312 days.  Yes, that's right...right around 10.5
months on the trail.  For comparison's sake, Andrew Skurka's pace often
exceeded 32 miles a day. If it can be done at a blazing pace in under 7 months,
in can certainly be done in a longer time-frame, albeit with potential
weather/seasonality issues.</p>

<p>While our goals may indeed be lofty,
our objective is wanderlust.  With your

</div></div>","Walking For WaterWater is life.  Plain and simple.  You cannot possibly have one without the other,
and right now, we don’t have enough to go around.  We are at a nexus.  We are a time of our lives where, if we care
about the future, we need to make some changes…some damn serious changes.  If we don’t, you see, we will grow thirstier
and thirstier…just as the mountains themselves, until we are stripped of any
and all means of life. 
That is more or less the blurb I am
going to shape this campaign on.  Water
is life…and we need to protect it as such.  We need to have some conversations on our future…mainly, where the hell
is our water…where the hell is our life…going to come from?  
No longer is it sustainable to imagine
Los Angeles County can continue to rape the watersheds of the Eastern Sierra
for another 101 years.  No longer can we stand
idly by as we watch cities and counties grow and grow, while watching our water
stores, our natural water stores, diminish with each and every passing
year.  And no longer can we stand idly by
as we watch legislatures create ‘long term solutions’ that will flood parts of
the Sierra that will never be seen again. 
We need change and we need it now! The Great Western LoopFirst and foremost, my goal (besides not-dying), is to create an awareness of the water crisis.  I figure that such a lofty goal, in a world filled with soundbites and attention spans of 140 characters, will require drastic measures just to gain a platform.  So, I am going big...I am hiking the Great Western Loop.  First hiked in 2006 by Andrew Skurka, the nearly 7,000 mile hike is a behemoth of unrivaled proportions.  The trek itself combines portions of 5 major trails to form the loop.  The trails that make-up the Great Western Loop are: the Pacific Crest Trail, the Pacific Northwest Trail, the Continental Divide Trail, New Mexico's Grand Enchantment Trail, and the Arizona Trail.  Second, I want to give back to the trails.  Think about it...you just can't get into these areas, into the wild landscapes of this great nation, without our network of trails.  You see, I want to help the trails...but I know that I don't know how to build a trail, or maintain a trail, or anything of the like.  Because of that, it only makes sense to help give back to them.  After all, they are the ones that have pick-and-shovel ready projects, but funding is always a consideration in what work gets done when.  Add to that the fact that each of us that have ever spent any time in the back-country know the value of a well-maintained trail, this provides a great chance to give-back to the 5 long-trails listed above.



The Water Crisis
Sit beneath the trees, they will impart
unto you their wisdom.  Walk amongst the granite, hear it cry out with thirst.
On one of my fall trips in the Sierra this year I came away with
that line.  If you have spent any time in the mountains over the past several years, I have a feeling that you will know
how right that statement feels, and moreover, how it holds true.
It is no secret that we are in the midst of
an incredibly elongated drought in the west, but people tend to forget...the mountains
need water too.  With an increase in overall temperatures and years of
below-normal snow-pack, the mountains are thirsty.
It speaks to our overall disconnect with
the land...we have forgotten where our water really comes from.  I have
news for you, it doesn't come from the damned tap.  Water, the very
essence of life, is quite literally born in the mountains.  Until we
recognize this, until we see the water crisis for what it truly is, until we
start turning on the taps and nothing comes out, well, we are pretty much
screwed.  
Think about it, while more and more water
can always be 'tapped' and taken away from the mountains, it can hardly be
replaced by anything but the forces of nature. Given the recent history, and
the years of drought, it's time to start hedging our bet...  If our
mountains are to stand up to the test of time, the test of our time that is,
well, it's time we stand up for them.  


My Background
Roughly 4 years ago, I
walked into the Superstition mountains on my very first backpacking trip.
 It sucked...I was way out of my league.  Hell, I even had to carry
my 6-month old puppy a solid 2 miles, if not more, just to get out of the mountains.
On that same trip, I walked out of the mountains a changed man. The seeds of
wanderlust were planted...I was in love.  
It would be almost another full year before
setting out into the wild again, but when I did...I found that the pull and
overall allure of the outdoors were no longer the same. The affinities I had
with the mountains had grown...much more than I could have imagined.
I made the decision that I was going to
arrange my life around backpacking on the weekends.  In the early days,
this meant undergoing such extreme measures as running a clothesline inside my
apartment just so I could spend the electricity savings on gear, or food, or
gas just to get to a trip.  I was hooked...like the truest addict that
ever was.  I was addicted to the mountains.
Since then, I have walked, traversed,
slid-down, and/or otherwise experienced many more mountain ranges throughout
the west.  As I experienced and witnessed
more, my wanderlust only grew.  I had to see more. I had to experience
more.  To do this, I even created my own backpacking group on meetup.com
(see http://meetup.com/Arizona-Epic-Adventures-Backpacking/)
right about a year and half ago.  In the
past 52 weeks alone, I have racked up more than 1,000 miles...and more than 700
miles the year before that.  
It is those very experiences that have since shaped me and my mission.


The Money 
I would love to be able to start out
on this journey on my own terms, with my own means.  Unfortunately, that just isn’t possible.  Back in early October I lost my job in
corporate America.  I had contracted
pneumonia during an almost 50 mile loop in the Sierra near Mt. Whitney.  Unluckily for me, I did not have the
sick-time and I was subsequently canned. 

Although it hasn’t been exactly
easy, I know I am on the right path.  I
can only describe it as a feeling of being called on to hike, a feeling of
being chosen, rightly or not, to give voice to the mountains. Help me raise my
voice!
Where the Money Goes –
The Trails
                         
Giving back from the get-go…  A secondary, but no-less important aspect of
my campaign, is doing whatever I can to support those who already make things
happen...giving back to those who already promote or otherwise work to engage
people. 
To support the organizations that do
the work that literally supports my boots on the ground by creating,
developing, and maintaining the trails I will travel, 50%  will be donated directly to the trail organizations. 
For each dollar raised by the campaign, 

$0.10 will be donated to the Pacific Crest Trail
     Association
$0.10 will be donated to the Arizona Trail Association
$0.10 will be donated to the Pacific Northwest Trail
     Association
$0.10 will be donated to the Grand Enchantment Trail
$0.10 will be donated to the Continental Divide Trail
     Coalition

Only $0.50 of every dollar will
actually go to the ""me"" component of this Walking for Water epic
itself.  It means that if we hit our goal of $30,000, I will have the
$15,000 needed to complete the journey...the remaining $15,000 goes
directly to the beneficiaries outlined above.  *As a side-note, the trails
are already all in the loop and have granted me use of the applicable logos to
use in this campaign.

Where the Money Goes - Gear
With a touch under 7,000 miles to
trek, gear and food will be my main expenses. While I am more-or-less geared up
to my friggin' ears, on a trip like this I am going to absolutely consume gear.
 Think of the Great Western Loop as the greatest endurance-testing stage
that has ever been set.  That said, if there are any gear companies that
would like to participate, and if you think your gear is up to such rigors (or
at least better than the other guys), well, let's do it!  ***Hint-hint

calories (going on the low-end on this assumption), add some math to the
728,000 'cold-day calories' and 1,020,000 calories for 'normal-day calories',
and there you have it...just under 1.75 million calories...or right under $8,000
in food expenses alone. 
Where the Money Goes – Technology
Throughout the journey, I will be
maintaining a daily blog...  While there will undoubtedly be periods of 4,
5, or even 7 days with no reception to sync the posts, entries will be
completed daily, even if only extremely brief...without fail. 
In addition to the blog, I'm going

ARCHIPELAGOS INSTITUTE OF MARINE CONSERVATION WAS THE FIRST ORGANISATION IN GREECE TO RESEARCH THE SPREAD OF MICROPLASTICS IN OUR SEAS
In today’s world plastics are everywhere. The global production of plastics has skyrocketed in recent decades, and so have the piles of plastic waste throughout the world. 
Many animals, including birds, mammals (terrestrial and marine) and reptiles, confuse plastic litter for food. As microplastics accumulate in our food chain, we are also affected by them, a product of our own doing.

Since 1998, Archipelagos Institute of Marine Conservation has been contributing towards the protection of the unique Mediterranean ecosystem. Since 2010 Archipelagos' research has shown that high levels of microplastics are found in fish and other wildlife of the Aegean Sea. Through bioaccumulation and feeding, dangerous microplastics find their way into fish, dolphins, whales, sea turtles and seals, some of whom are threatened species. Microplastics have even been found in plankton.WE AIM TOUNDERSTAND the spread of microplastics in our seasPUBLISH scientific papers
Initiate a media CAMPAIGN
URGE the Greek & the EU authorities to take measures limiting plastic contamination> OUR PURPOSEIn order to address the problem of microplastics spreading across our seas, our action plan mainly focuses on the monitoring of microplastics in the Aegean Sea and other parts of the North-East Mediterranean. This will allow us to create public engagement and political pressure concerning its impacts. 
We wish to:


Carry out scientific research and monitor the quantity of microplastics
Initiate and/or improve the co-operation with other countries 

Lobby on national and EU scales that will allow the European actions to evolve 

Organize public awareness, education and information to improve public knowledge

> WHAT DO WE NEED ?
1. Details of the main equipment 
- FTIR Microscope Imager
Currently, the microplastics in our samples can only be identified by sight. And although strict guidelines are being followed, it is possible that only 70% of these fragments would be confirmed as plastic through FTIR Spectroscopy. FTIR spectroscopy stands for Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, and it is able to determine the chemical composition of plastic fragments very confidently. With this information, not only will we be able to accurately investigate the abundance of microplastics in the Aegean Sea, but also we will be able to ascertain the original source of the plastic. This will provide strong evidence to help convince the Greek government to exert pressure on the industries responsible for the influx of plastic into our sea.
- High Speed CentrifugeA
centrifuge is a piece of equipment that aids the mixing of solutions. The use
of a centrifuge within the method, will significantly speed up the process of
separating the sample from the plastic. We would therefore be able to analyse a much greater number of samples resulting in a much more accurate conclusion.
- Stereomicroscope
Sometimes referred to as a dissecting microscope. This will aid the sampling process by providing visual aid and will be used in our on-going research.

- Lyophilizer
This machine will enable us to freeze dry our samples. Freeze drying will preserve the perishable sample material for much longer, making it more manageable and accessible to sample over long periods of time. 
- Continuous Plankton Recorder
A continuous plankton recorder would be
extremely valuable to our research. We would be able to take samples over long periods of time and monitor the occurrence of microplastics consistently and indefinitely. We will be able to determine any significant increase in plastic over time, and also any patterns or changes in distribution.

2. Other requirements
In addition to the equipment mentioned above, we also require laboratory consumables (such as sample containers, glassware etc.) and fuel for sampling surveys.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>One’s typical image of Hawaii would probably consist of beautiful beaches, golf courses and hotel resorts. However, a hidden gem of native forests that evolved over millions of years in isolation rests just beyond our sights. Kokee, Kauai, is one of those great treasures that still flourishes on the island of Kauai; the forest is home to hundreds of native plant species, 90% of which are endemic and grow nowhere else on the planet, including over 140 rare and endangered plants. This degree of endemism is higher than anywhere else in the world.  </p>
<p>The Kokee forests nurture plants that are precious to Hawaiian culture. While being famous for being a biodiversity hotspot of global significance, Kokee also provides a wide range of ecosystem services, plays a role in the preservation of Hawaiian tradition and culture, and gives a unique platform for education and recreation.</p>
<p>Today, this dynamic diversity in Hawaiian ecosystems is increasingly threatened by invasive non-native weeds that have been rapidly displacing native vegetation.  Hawaii has become known as the ""endangered species capital of the world"" and the ""extinction capital of the world"" because of the many plants, and particularly beautiful birds, that have become extinct. Invasive weed control has been identified as a high priority by the US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service in their recovery plans for nearly all the endangered species on Kauai.  Unless there is a strategic and sustained effort to control these weeds, the core native forests will be irreversible converted to non-native vegetation.</p>
<p>The survival of Kokee's native forests relies on passionate volunteers who tread lightly across the steep canyon range and fragile native forest to weed out invasives and plant native species.</p>
<p>The Kokee Resource Conservation Program engages and educates volunteers through hands-on work in one of the world's most endangered and biodiverse hot-spots. We propagate land stewardship and create helpful access to Kauai's mountain forests for locals and visitors.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>My name is José Luis Gutiérrez-García, I have a Master Certificate in Corporate and Environmental Sustainability and in 2011, I held the Chair of the Sustainability Committee at a remote gold mining operation in the Arctic.</p>
<p>Upcycling is the practice of taking waste and transforming it into something of similar or greater use and value. In other words, upcycling uses waste materials to provide us with valuable products.</p>
<p>The <em>Upcycle the Gyres Society </em>works to upcycle the floating plastic waste from the ocean currents into diesel, gasoline, kerosene and/or light crude oil.</p>
<p>In order to accomplish this, the Society will facilitate the design, construction, operation, management, and maintenance of the first ever: self-sufficient, Deep Sea Mining, Eco-floating production, storage, and offloading (DSM-FPSO) research facility.</p>
<p>This DSMFPSO will provide year round research facilities to marine institutes, foundations and coalitions in order to implement breakthrough solutions for Ocean restoration and Marine Plastic Mining in the next three years.</p>
<p>Marine Plastic Mining is the process of recovering plastic wealth from deposits on the surface and on the seabed, and upcycling it into fuel at sea.</p>
<p>The money fueling the cleanup and upcycling operations will come from investors who are attracted to the idea of making a return on their investment while helping to keep the oceans clean and healthy.</p>
<p>To that end, I am starting the environmental not-for profit <em>Upcycle the Gyres Society</em> (<em>UGS</em>) based in Vancouver, Canada.</p>
<p>Your financial investment will help the <em>UGS</em> achieve its immediate goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fund the Society’s registration expenses and campaign fees</li>
<li>Create and launch the <em>UGS</em> website</li>
</ul><p>Advance the efforts of establishing an accurate baseline on plastic pollution density, and remove the pollution from the marine ecosystem</p>
<ul>
<li>Seed funding to cover the board of Directors expenses to conduct the Society’s work</li>
<ul>
<li>The Board of Directors of the <em>UGS</em> does not receive monetary compensation for being directors; however, the board is entitled to reimbursements for expenses incurred to do their job</li>
</ul>
</ul><p><strong>Seeking</strong></p>
<p>$22,000.00 will provide the <em>UGS</em> with exposure. Get us on the radar.</p>
<p>We will use your investment to attend specific events where this idea-solution can be pitched to socially responsible investors, industry, and politicians.</p>
<p>The funds will also be used to participate in an expedition(s) with research institutes to understand how to better design, construct, operate, manage and maintain the first eco-floating, self-sufficient, production, storage, and offloading (FPSO) research-upcycling facility. </p>
<p>The vision is to have a revenue neutral and self-funding FPSO eco-resort.</p>
<p>By deriving an income from travelers focused on sustainable living, the environment, social justice, personal development, and health, this Floating Eco Research Upcycling Resort will support researchers in numerous ways, while  the eco tourists would contribute funding, spread the word, and learn new skills.</p>
<p>By connecting research data and information to solutions providers faster; industry will be able to implement breakthrough solutions for Marine Plastic Mining and Ocean plastic pollution restoration that will get the oceans cleaner and healthier sooner.</p>
<p>The eco-research-upcycling resort is upscalable. As the technology and collection methodology improves, and the operation and amounts of recoverable plastic grow, the eco-FPSO-resort will be able to sell the upcycled plastic as fuel to fund its operations and expansion to other areas that need clean up.</p>
<p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Immediate Goals</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Secure funding to register the Society in Vancouver, Canada</li>
<li>Secure funding to create and launch The Upcycle the Gyres website</li>
<li>Secure funding to attend conferences to find investors and partners</li>
</ul><p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Your investment on the Upcycle the Gyres Society will provide you with:</p>
<p>A cleaner marine environment: non-polluted beaches,healthy seafood and all that that entails</p>
<p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>The Importance of your Investment</strong></p>
<p>Today, marine research expeditions take a long time to complete. First they must physically reach the oceanic plastic convergence zone. They are limited to the time they can spend at sea collecting data and samples. Then they spend time getting back to land to continue their work figuring out how to best rehabilitate the marine eco-system.</p>

Hello,
My name is José Luis Gutiérrez-García, I have a Master Certificate in Corporate and Environmental Sustainability and in 2011, I held the Chair of the Sustainability Committee at a remote gold mining operation in the Arctic.
Upcycling is the practice of taking waste and transforming it into something of similar or greater use and value. In other words, upcycling uses waste materials to provide us with valuable products.
The Upcycle the Gyres Society works to upcycle the floating plastic waste from the ocean currents into diesel, gasoline, kerosene and/or light crude oil.
In order to accomplish this, the Society will facilitate the design, construction, operation, management, and maintenance of the first ever: self-sufficient, Deep Sea Mining, Eco-floating production, storage, and offloading (DSM-FPSO) research facility.
This DSMFPSO will provide year round research facilities to marine institutes, foundations and coalitions in order to implement breakthrough solutions for Ocean restoration and Marine Plastic Mining in the next three years.
Marine Plastic Mining is the process of recovering plastic wealth from deposits on the surface and on the seabed, and upcycling it into fuel at sea.
The money fueling the cleanup and upcycling operations will come from investors who are attracted to the idea of making a return on their investment while helping to keep the oceans clean and healthy.
To that end, I am starting the environmental not-for profit Upcycle the Gyres Society (UGS) based in Vancouver, Canada.
Your financial investment will help the UGS achieve its immediate goals:

Fund the Society’s registration expenses and campaign fees
Create and launch the UGS website
Advance the efforts of establishing an accurate baseline on plastic pollution density, and remove the pollution from the marine ecosystem

Seed funding to cover the board of Directors expenses to conduct the Society’s work

The Board of Directors of the UGS does not receive monetary compensation for being directors; however, the board is entitled to reimbursements for expenses incurred to do their job

Seeking
$22,000.00 will provide the UGS with exposure. Get us on the radar.
We will use your investment to attend specific events where this idea-solution can be pitched to socially responsible investors, industry, and politicians.
The funds will also be used to participate in an expedition(s) with research institutes to understand how to better design, construct, operate, manage and maintain the first eco-floating, self-sufficient, production, storage, and offloading (FPSO) research-upcycling facility. 
The vision is to have a revenue neutral and self-funding FPSO eco-resort.
By deriving an income from travelers focused on sustainable living, the environment, social justice, personal development, and health, this Floating Eco Research Upcycling Resort will support researchers in numerous ways, while  the eco tourists would contribute funding, spread the word, and learn new skills.
By connecting research data and information to solutions providers faster; industry will be able to implement breakthrough solutions for Marine Plastic Mining and Ocean plastic pollution restoration that will get the oceans cleaner and healthier sooner.
The eco-research-upcycling resort is upscalable. As the technology and collection methodology improves, and the operation and amounts of recoverable plastic grow, the eco-FPSO-resort will be able to sell the upcycled plastic as fuel to fund its operations and expansion to other areas that need clean up.

Immediate Goals

Secure funding to register the Society in Vancouver, Canada
Secure funding to create and launch The Upcycle the Gyres website
Secure funding to attend conferences to find investors and partners

What You Get
Your investment on the Upcycle the Gyres Society will provide you with:
A cleaner marine environment: non-polluted beaches,healthy seafood and all that that entails

The Importance of your Investment
Today, marine research expeditions take a long time to complete. First they must physically reach the oceanic plastic convergence zone. They are limited to the time they can spend at sea collecting data and samples. Then they spend time getting back to land to continue their work figuring out how to best rehabilitate the marine eco-system.
The technology to convert plastic to fuel is available and already in use in Japan, and it is starting to catch on in the U.S.
The technology to manage the collection, processing, storage and offloading of plastic fuel already exists in the form of offshore oil and gas rigs and marine diamond mining vessels.
Our strategy is to combine, adapt, transfer and customize these solutions to manage the plastc debris in the oceans. and by extension, improve the health of our seafood chain.
The Upcycle the Gyres Society suggests that time matters. The sooner research provides practical solutions, and the sooner individuals, governments, and industry implement these breakthroughs in research and technology, the greater the benefits we all stand to gain.
I am a highly motivated professional. I have a proven record of proposing and implementing measures, programs, and systems solutions that minimize our environmental footprint.
For example, I authored a study-report about transforming gold mine mill waste (tailings) into building materials to help safe water bodies from becoming tailings ponds.
 
Other Ways You Can Help
 
Get involved!!!
This is a brand new organization.  
The Upcycle the Gyres Society is looking for energetic, ‘can do’ individuals to join our board of Directors and create a steering committee. We’d love a multinational team drawn from areas such as marine biology, the sciences, ecology, eco-tourism, hospitality, mining, IT, design, engineering, research and marketing, education, sustainable business development, investing, fundraising, writing, the arts, innovation, and from other fields.
People who will guide the UG Society's actions to achieve its goals effectively and in a timely manner are invited.
The steering committee will meet regularly with the board of Directors in person or virtually through Skype or other long distance conferencing means.
We will partner with organizations encouraging the production and use of ‘cradle to grave’ alternatives to plastics and with organizations working to educate the public across the globe on the damage done by plastics in the oceans.

</div></div></div></div>","Trashion?

In case that's not obvious, that's trash + fashion.  Junk to
Funk (J2F) uses Avant-garde Trashion as art for social change to get people to think differently about waste.  It's not about getting people to wear trash, that would be ridiculous don't you think?  We use Trashion as an artistic expression to addresses the serious impacts that our consumer culture has on social and ecological health.

We use our Trashion as the focal point in event entertainment, public installations, youth programs and soon to be launched ""flashmob"" style guerrilla outreach campaigns.  We think the best way to inspire change is to make it beautiful, to make it cool and and to make it FUN!


So letâ€™s make the trash talk short and sweet.  We are at a pivotal juncture in our development and we think the facts below will give you a pretty good idea of why your support is so crucial to our success; our goals, our projects, our inspiration, where your funds will go and why the issues we are addressing are so important. 

Two Quick Notes! 
* Please help us spread the word through your networks by sharing our campaign through email, facebook and twitter by using the appropriate links above.
* Unlike KickStarter, IndieGoGo allows us to keep any funds we raise!  So even if we don't reach our goal, every little bit helps with projects planned for 2012.

Top 5 things your donation will fund in 2012

We need to raise $1500 to complete our fundraising goals for a
public installation in downtown Portland featuring garments created out
of the most thrown away single use disposables products in the world; coffee
cups, plastic bags and plastic beverage bottles.  These products are typically used for about an hour and then thrown away, pretty wasteful and unnecessary right?  Let's get rid of em!
We need to raise $1000 to complete our fundraising goals to launch
our interactive guerilla â€œflashmobâ€ event series that will take place in
populated public areas and events throughout the summer.  We'll be using the same single use disposables as mentioned above but this time it will become an interactive memorable experience for those lucky enough to be captured in the participation!

We need more Trashion!  Your funds will help generate the creation of new, mind blowing, gorgeous, outrageous Trashion garments.  The value of one garment
alone can be between several hundred to several thousands of dollars; they don't just manifest themselves out of a dumpster you know.

We need up to $7,500 to fund our efforts to expand our
activities beyond Portland; weâ€™ll continue to do cool projects in our favorite
city but we need to move our sustainability message beyond the choir.
We need up to $7,500 to fund our efforts to expand our
volunteer program so that we can establish collaborations that will strengthen our efforts.




Top 5 reasons to give

If you care about people and the planet then why not support
one of the most creative groups working to solve this social and environmental
issue? 
Junk to Funk is part of what makes Portland unique.  What would Portland be without Junk to Funk?!? 

Support the hard working artists that are creating these
amazing Avant-garde Trashion artworks. 

Nearly all of what weâ€™ve accomplished has been done on a
grassroots level and through the dedication of rockstar volunteers; we can only be
successful when sustainable and we need seed funding to grow.
You can support art, the environment and a social innovation
all at the same time with one click of a button! (that button is to your upper left if you are already inspired to contribute)









Top 5 proud moments of 2011


We were recently accepted into PSUâ€™s Impact Entrepreneurâ€™s Social
Innovation Incubator program for 2012.

We were just awarded a grant from the Regional Arts and Culture Council that will in large, fund a public installation in downtown Portland (as mentioned above in the top 5 things your donation will fund in 2012...we still need to raise $1500!).

From the generosity of the PDX Storefront program we created two public installations in downtown Portland last year, catching the attention of a few hundred thousand passersby. 

House of Trashion designer Jen LaMastra was commissioned by Vitaminwater to create a garment out of recycled bottles and star in an online web series for a recycling project marketing campaign.

The Oregonian featured Junk to Funk in a 3-page article on the front of the Sunday â€œOâ€ section last spring. 












Top 5 reasons why our work is so important

According to EPA reports, while our recycling rates have
increased so, too, have our landfill disposal rates. This means we are buying
and throwing away more stuff than ever, in fact about twice as much as we where
30 years ago. 


If everyone in the world consumed like Americanâ€™s weâ€™d need
about four planets to satisfy those needs.  We donâ€™t think thatâ€™s going to happen anytime soon.


For everyone one can of garbage that you throw out on the
curb for pick up, 70 cans of waste were created in making of the stuff that you
just threw away.  Wonder whoâ€™s
paying that bill? 

99% of our stuff ends up either recycled or in the landfill
in just 6 months.  Seriously, thatâ€™s pretty unnecessary donâ€™t you think?
Inspiring individuals to change consumer-related behaviors
has the potential to yield a twenty-five per cent diversion of municipal waste
away from our landfills. So all we
have to do is get people to think differently about wasteâ€¦cool, we are on it.











Our top 5 goals for using Trashion as a powerful tool for
behavior change

To captivate audiences through visually striking artwork.
Use artistic expression and entertainment as the means to
tell stories that will generate awareness about the impacts of our consumption
habits.
Use the methodologies of the â€˜Fun Theoryâ€™, â€˜Social Marketingâ€™
and â€˜Guerrilla Marketingâ€™ to engage participants in hands-on activities that will
generate a message that will stick.
Deliver an experience that is so unique, positive and fun
that it sparks new ideas, creates new dreams and inspires new actions.
Provide resources and alternative solutions to pave the way
toward monumental consumer-related behavior change.











Top 5 reasons weâ€™re so passionate about this issue


Weâ€™ve done a ton of research on the impacts our materials
economy.  We are repulsed to find
that such ecological and social adversities can come from our countryâ€™s
addiction to stuff.


Itâ€™s not just about getting recycling right.  The biggest waste-related impacts come
from the creation, shipping and use of our stuff.   There needs to be an entire paradigm shift in our
consumer behaviors and our relationships to stuff.

While weâ€™re not the only group trying to solve waste related
issues, we do think that there needs to be a larger focus on using creativity,
art, humor,and FUN to generate experiences that will inspire
behavior change for social good.

There are tens of thousands of organizations working on environmental
issues so why one more?  We believe
that the more groups that are working towards this common goal, the more
quickly and efficiently we can create the world that we all wish to see.

We canâ€™t wait for government, technology and green products
to solve our problems.  Itâ€™s all of
our responsibilities to be mindful as individual consumers, with what we buy, who we buy
it from, impacts of use and end of life considerations.


                   

Top 5 positive thoughts for creating a new way of thinking

Imagine a world in which there was no such thing as trash;
that everything that we â€œthrew awayâ€ was perceived as a valuable resource, used
to create something new or as a nutrient for the earth.  
What if long-lasting and repairable purchases ruled over
cheap prices?
What if durable was more convenient than disposables, and we
valued doing stuff instead of buying stuff?
Consider that low-impact doesnâ€™t mean sacrifice, but is a
means to reclaim our time, money and pursuit of happiness.
What if the ultimate measure of coolness was how little you
bought, how much you shared and how much you creatively reused?

Top 5 groups that inspire us

The Story of Stuff
The Center for a New American Dream
Founders of â€œThe Fun Theoryâ€
Haute Trash and  
Recycled Runway (two other great groups
using trashion to change the world)


 

A personal note from the Founder and ""Chief Instigator""
Many of you know us as the Junk to Funk Recycled Fashion Show Contest; the annual runway shows in Portland that have collectively featured over 100 Trashion (thatâ€™s trash fashion) garments as seen in our last show in the featured video above.  Many donâ€™t know that we had to bring to an end the event because of the recession; the economy crashed and we lost nearly all of our sponsors.  With no other financial backing and limited resources, it made it impossible to move forward with the big production that cost about $40,000 to operate on top of the $50,000 in in-kind support we received.  

I see this as a blessing in disguise.  I started Junk to Funk because I thought it would be a fun, very ""Portland"" event; mixing art, fashion and sustainability.  After selling out our shows and receiving notable media attention, even with the economic crash, many of us knew that Junk to Funk had the opportunity to create a much larger impact by expanding our activities beyond an annual runway show.  

We changed our model in 2010 to establish the ""collective"" and to develop several new activities that now operate throughout the year; you can learn more about these on our website,  www.junktofunk.org.  Weâ€™ve brought our work to literally hundreds of thousands of viewers with extremely limited resources and through the commitment from some very talented rock star volunteers.  





We want to
continue this creative and pioneering work but it requires your support. 
We need to

<h3 class=""western""><strong><em><span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif;""><br/>What if we had sea transportation that caused no environmental harm AND allowed many millions of underprivileged people to access profitable markets and fisheries?</span></em></strong></h3>
<h3 class=""western""><strong><em><span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"">How about a ship that produces electrical power, instead of just consuming fuel?</span></em></strong></h3>
<p class=""western""><strong><span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif;""><a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/gavall?a=594913"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gavin</a>:</span></strong><span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"">  Well, a few years ago, we came up with an idea for just such a ship.  While we've been refining the idea and consulting with communities and relevant experts, we've confirmed that there is a large, and growing need for this kind of innovation. Large scale, high-volume ocean shipping is relatively efficient and adequate for the big players in globalization.  But for the hundreds of millions of poor that live along the world's coastlines, there is no cheap, safe way to get their products to global markets, or access fisheries that are just over the horizon.  This means that no matter how hard they work, they cannot get a fair price for their products.  For people who can earn only a few dollars per day, this kind of competitive edge makes the difference between misery and a decent lifestyle.</span></p>
<p class=""western""><strong><span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif;""><a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/gavall?a=594913"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pat</a>:</span></strong><span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"">  Since these impoverished coastal and island communities will be the principal end-users of our ship, we designed her specifically with universally available materials, very low cost to build and maintain, operable along undeveloped shorelines, simple to run with minimal training &amp; formal education, and of course, zero-fuel.</span></p>
<p class=""western""><span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"">What we have is an elegant, simple, leapfrog technology, that can even the playing field a little for those coastal and riverbank peoples who live in poverty.  And one that may well lead the way towards cleaner technologies for all of us.</span></p>

<p class=""western""><span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"">* </span><strong><span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"">No fuel</span></strong><span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"">.  That means </span><span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">no fuel costs</span></span><span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"">, </span><span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">no CO<sub>2</sub> or other emissions </span></span><span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"">, and no need for refueling stops.  It means </span><em><span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"">your primary operating cost is labor</span></em><span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif;""> - a cost that varies appropriately with local economies, as opposed to fuel which is tied directly to a global market.</span></p>
<p class=""western""><span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"">* </span><strong><span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"">Low maintenance</span></strong><span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"">.  Removing reliance on combustion-based engines means maintenance becomes infrequent and inexpensive.</span></p>
<p class=""western""><span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"">* </span><strong><span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"">No range limits</span></strong><span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"">.  Combined with no fuel costs ticking away every minute of your time makes for considerable flexibility in operations.<br/></span></p>
<p class=""western""><strong><span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"">Why small?</span></strong></p>
<p class=""western""><span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif;""><a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/gavall?a=594913"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gavin:</a> Well, present-day <span class=""st"">solar photovoltaic (PV)</span> panels are clean &amp; efficient, but limited in power output.  They can provide the auxiliary power needs of a ship this size.  Not bigger.  Not yet. The main propulsion power is from the wind, and the solar-charged electricity is used to run the motors, the winches and capstans, the electronic communications and navigational equipment, and the 'house' power -- lights, refrigerator, watermakers.</span></p>
<p class=""western""><span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"">It turns out that smaller ships make up most of the world's fleet and answer the needs of developing communities nicely.</span></p>

<p class=""western""><span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"">* Innovative combination mast-crane design that allows <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">loading even when there are no port facilities at all </span> and especially low clearance (under low bridges and power lines)</span></p>

The project involves locally trained crews from coastal communities on the Lau and Kadavu islands in Fiji. They will operate a number of smaller cargo catamarans along with a larger Greenheart ship that will service the larger island groups.

<p class=""western""><span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"">First, she is a remarkably low cost ship to build.

We are working with a shipyard in Bangladesh, and along with the funds and equipment/service support we already have, we are a fair way down the road to financing the ship. This $120,000 will help to push us over the top in getting the steel hull work done. Our designers, volunteers &amp; crew will then be going to Bangladesh to complete the job. This way, we will all be well-acquainted with her details when it comes to sea trials.</span></p>

What if we had sea transportation that caused no environmental harm AND allowed many millions of underprivileged people to access profitable markets and fisheries?
How about a ship that produces electrical power, instead of just consuming fuel?
Gavin:  Well, a few years ago, we came up with an idea for just such a ship.  While we've been refining the idea and consulting with communities and relevant experts, we've confirmed that there is a large, and growing need for this kind of innovation. Large scale, high-volume ocean shipping is relatively efficient and adequate for the big players in globalization.  But for the hundreds of millions of poor that live along the world's coastlines, there is no cheap, safe way to get their products to global markets, or access fisheries that are just over the horizon.  This means that no matter how hard they work, they cannot get a fair price for their products.  For people who can earn only a few dollars per day, this kind of competitive edge makes the difference between misery and a decent lifestyle.
Pat:  Since these impoverished coastal and island communities will be the principal end-users of our ship, we designed her specifically with universally available materials, very low cost to build and maintain, operable along undeveloped shorelines, simple to run with minimal training & formal education, and of course, zero-fuel.
What we have is an elegant, simple, leapfrog technology, that can even the playing field a little for those coastal and riverbank peoples who live in poverty.  And one that may well lead the way towards cleaner technologies for all of us.
A Sail-Solar Hybrid Ship 
Pat: Meet Sailing Vessel (S/V) Greenheart, a small industrial ship that uses only sails and solar-electric for power. 

Displacement 220 tons                    Length 31.5m (103ft)
Beam 7.8m (25.5ft)                         Draught 2.2m (7ft)
Sail: 300 m² (3230 ft²)                    Solar (PV) array:125 m² (1313 ft²)
DC motors: 100kW x 2                   Battery: Lead/Acid traction
Hull speed: 10~11 kn                     Cargo: 3 x 20ft shipping containers
 Jen: With your help the first ship, S/V Greenheart, will be launched in the middle of next year. The first ship shares it's name with our organisation, the Greenheart project. We are a registered non-profit staffed by a diverse group of small ship designers, avid sailors, sustainable development advocates and passionate volunteers working to make sail and sail-solar hybrids a sustainable sea transport solution for the future.
Pat: Here's what's attractive about a sail-solar hybrid vs. a conventional diesel vessel:
* No fuel.  That means no fuel costs, no CO2 or other emissions , and no need for refueling stops.  It means your primary operating cost is labor - a cost that varies appropriately with local economies, as opposed to fuel which is tied directly to a global market.
* Low maintenance.  Removing reliance on combustion-based engines means maintenance becomes infrequent and inexpensive.
* No range limits.  Combined with no fuel costs ticking away every minute of your time makes for considerable flexibility in operations.
Why small?
Gavin: Well, present-day solar photovoltaic (PV) panels are clean & efficient, but limited in power output.  They can provide the auxiliary power needs of a ship this size.  Not bigger.  Not yet. The main propulsion power is from the wind, and the solar-charged electricity is used to run the motors, the winches and capstans, the electronic communications and navigational equipment, and the 'house' power -- lights, refrigerator, watermakers.
It turns out that smaller ships make up most of the world's fleet and answer the needs of developing communities nicely.
Pat: Serving areas with minimal (or zero) infrastructure was a design priority:
* Purposefully shallow hull for beach landing and river system access.
* A tailgate-like roll-on, roll-off capability via a sort of drawbridge in the stern allows interesting cargo, fishing, and eco-tourism applications.
* Innovative combination mast-crane design that allows loading even when there are no port facilities at all  and especially low clearance (under low bridges and power lines)
* Cargo flexibility accommodating anything from burlap sacks to standard shipping containers.
 
We've also focused on durability, repairability, and relative simplicity to operate and learn. ...and affordability. It doesn't matter how great your solution is if people can't afford to acquire one for themselves and make it their own.
Jen: We have devised a tool that screams out for innovative, entrepreneurial uses -- one that empowers local people and helps them become more resilient.
Trade between developing regions that skips the developed world entirely.  All kinds of ferry and mail services.  Fishing, ecotourism, floating machinist shops... The ships could even function as solar power stations when docked.  We anticipate not being able to anticipate all the uses creative people will find for them. 
Satoshi:  In case you haven't guessed -- this is an open source project, too.  We want people to take our designs, modify them to suit their own purposes, and run with it.  Just let us know how you're doing, what's working well, and what can be improved.  The best way to find a better future is to look for it together. 
(For more project and technical information, check out our project PDF and our design pages.)
Greenheart's Plan - How you can help
Jen: We've spent the last few years thinking, planning, designing.  
Now we're ready to bring our ship from the naval architect's office to the water.
Our plan is to take the first one on a voyage around the world, testing the sail/solar hybrid concept in several different applications, including a good deal of time in the marginalized areas where a Greenheart ship will be most useful.
Gavin: We have a growing community of partners who want to work with us on our first trial applications. One such example is a groundbreaking project in Fiji to create a sustainable local shipping network in collaboration with leading NGO's (IUCN-Oceania Programme , World Wildlife Fund (WWF)- South Pacific Programme), local sailing groups (Fiji islands Voyaging Society , Sailing for Sustainability), academia (University of South Pacific) regional bodies (Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) , Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP) and shipping (B9 Shipping)
Many South Pacific island groups are faced with long blue ocean distances between them, limited resources of fossil fuel and existing shipping that is worn out, unreliable, polluting, dangerous and expensive to operate. The project involves locally trained crews from coastal communities on the Lau and Kadavu islands in Fiji. They will operate a number of smaller cargo catamarans along with a larger Greenheart ship that will service the larger island groups. This type of network will make communities more resilient in the face of climate change and be a model for the entire region.
Michele: We need your help to get started.
It is time to build the first ship.  One ship sounds like a small thing - but it will have an impact on thousands of lives.  And, it won’t be just one ship - it will be the first of dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of ships like it all over the world.
We start with one. This first one -- S/V Greenheart -- we will sail around the world on a 60,000 mile voyage.  Take a look at the route map;  It's epic.  
 
Jen: The idea is to test the ship in a wide variety of conditions, and in various applications.  We will be carrying freight for NGOs, buying and selling our own goods, experimenting with fishing under sail, visiting remote and impoverished communities to get input and feedback on the ship.  There will also be high-profile visits to our partners, port-of-call cities like Hamburg, Seattle, and Vancouver, for festive events and to show off the ship.  We will have scientists aboard, conducting experiments and we'll be doing our own trials as an eco-tour boat - visiting pristine regions. 

 
More than just Perks -- Shares
Gavin: This Indiegogo campaign asks you to support us, and we have something special in mind for the Perks.  We are offering Shares in the maiden voyage of the first ship.   You will actually be purchasing a portion of the adventure - one that you can participate in, not just follow on a blog.  In the tradition of the great merchant/adventure/discovery voyages of the past, we will form a 'company' of partners in this first round-the-world odyssey. We already have cities and NGOs, scientists and equipment sponsors aboard. (see supporters pages in the gallery)  Now we want to crowdsource some of the crew, the supporters, and the stakeholders.
All supporters will get official invitations and discounts on the shipped goods for sale...
And for those who purchased the Shares, there will be something extra. These Shares are in the Maiden Voyage. 
 
Gavin: Redeem these at any time during the two-year trip. You can:


Sail for a Day - Meet the Greenheart ship when she sails into a port near you and come out aboard her for the day (1 share) If you can't afford much time, but still want a taste of life aboard the ship, this is for you.


Join us on the Voyage - Each share is roughly equivalent to one day at sea, 3 shares ($250) allows you to join us as crew on a short hop while 7 shares ($500) will give you one week aboard and you can travel between many neighboring countries (or significant distances along the coasts of larger ones). At 15 shares ($1000) you get a fortnight that can take you across a continent or for the really adventurous join us for a month-long epic ocean crossing. Read more... (Details, route examples etc.) 


Trading - Perhaps you will use your Share to trade a bit on your own (for example, buy paprika in Zanzibar, and have it delivered to you in Hamburg, or Boston). You can hand your Share over to our ship's bursar with your request on the goods you want to trade. We'll give you regular updates, product information and advice along the way.


Ship with Us – Got a cargo you want to send from one part of the world to another? Don't want to worry about any fossil fuel miles? You've come to the right place. These products will get our “Blue Sea Miles” zero-carbon label and we'll deliver it straight into your hands at one of our ports of call. You could even sell at our port events if you'd like. Alternately, if you’re not in a big hurry, we’re also happy to do things like help ship your bicycle overseas. One share is the equivalent of shipping 100kg, 500 nautical miles (nm) (exludes port fees, taxes etc.)


Donate - Some people might decide to donate their Shares to an NGO to help with their shipping needs. We will match every donation with an additional share. Just let us know which organisation you would like to give those to, and we will send them the shares and give them a chance to thank you in person.

Jen: Everyone will be part of the ship's Company and help make it a success -- twice. Once when you click to pay, and again when you redeem your Share however you like.
Satoshi: The Greenheart Project has always been open-source. By that we mean that we are not patenting any innovations, nor protecting any intellectual property. Our principal goal is to get the idea into practice as soon and as much as possible. 
Now, we are opening the exciting first voyage of the first ship to the public, too. If this IndieGoGo campaign reaches our goal, we will do more in other languages, in other markets along our route. The optimal scenario is to have the first ship and her voyages entirely funded by Greeenheart supporters. All additional funds and trading revenue will be used to establish a non-profit, cooperative fund to help build subsequent ships worldwide.
 
Our Indiegogo Funding Goal is $120,000*
THE ASTERISK
Gavin: $120,000 may seem like a suprisingly small amount to build a ship. So, here's a little detail on what we can do with that amount. 
First, she is a remarkably low cost ship to build. Remember that we designed her for use by the people in the least-developed regions of the world. This is where our technology is most sorely needed. And where people can least afford it. 
The S/V Greenheart can be built and fitted out for $500,000. ( We expect the cost of ships to trend downward as we increase production.) We are working with a shipyard in Bangladesh, and along with the funds and equipment/service support we already have, we are a fair way down the road to financing the ship. This $120,000 will help to push us over the top in getting the steel hull work done. Our designers, volunteers & crew will then be going to Bangladesh to complete the job. This way, we will all be well-acquainted with her details when it comes to sea trials.
Michele: If we can get additional funds, then outfitting the ship and getting her sea tested and prepared for her worldwide journey becomes a whole lot easier. With your support we can get construction under way with our goal to launch the ship in the middle of next year.

Perk Alternatives

Gavin: You can have your name aboard the ship. We will be flying flags at every port.  Each port call will be an event - a festive event where interested locals, supporters, and media can come down, see the ship, talk to the crew, browse through the zero carbon goods people have shipped with us, meet other people interested in sail as serious transport, enjoy good music, food, and drink, etc.  Your flag can be among the many that festoon the ship.
Throughout this campaign we will also offer some additional perk options for you to use your donations and share certificates on if you so wish. These can be sent to you straight away, and we will find a way to offset the carbon, you can collect them yourselves, preferably by bicycle or under sail – decreasing that footprint or you can wait and have them delivered by us.Some of these perk options are available now:
($50+) Masi Cloth from Moce, Fiji This is a gift set of beautifully handwoven cloth directly from the women making it in the village of Korova.  The village, a squatter encampment on the edge of Suva, is recognised as the cultural home of this craft in Fiji.  In addition to weaving, the Moce community living there is one of the last still keeping camakau sailing alive in Fiji. Many in the village are unemployed and sales by the women of Masi is one of the staple income earners they have. Read more...
($100+) A Cache of Zero-Carbon Rum and Wine - Our friends at Fair Transport have been sailing artisanal rum from the Dominican Republic and Madeira to Europe aboard their merchant brigantine, the Tres Hombres, for several years now. This is no grog we're talking about - it's the good stuff that belongs in a place of pride in the captain's quarters.  Though they have traveled thousands miles, these bottles have generated not a single ounce of CO2 - have the sea miles nurtured their flavor and character? It's up to you to find out. Read more..
($2500) A Handcrafted Bangladeshi Traditional Sail Boat Model - Our freinds at the Friendship Association and Taratari Shipyard in Chittagong, Bangladesh want to present to you two hand crafted, museum quality, 2-4ft long traditional sail boat models. A number of these beautifully made models are on exhibition in Paris Museum and the construction of these helps to pay local master boat builders and keep their traditions alive. A one-of-a-kind treasure, to be sure. Read more...
We will be posting a few more perk options as these become available during the campaign. When you make a donation, just let us know if you would prefer to take one of the options available and we will arrange that.
*Build & Sailing Schedule Changes
Pat: Building a ship is a major undertaking, and there can be unforeseen delays and departures from schedule. You will have to be flexible when it comes to redeeming your share certificates, and we will continue to do our best to keep on schedule.
In addition, shipping cargo and joining the vessel will be on a schedule that is dependent upon wind and other conditions. Our good friends at Fair Transport have agreed to back us up and supply a limited number of berths and cargo space on their cargo/sail brigantine, the Tres Hombres. These would be made available on their regular Europe-Caribbean-US-Europe route.",15.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>So, we decided to open e VEGAN hostel and people have been loving our place, but we need some more beds. currently we have 7 beds and some hammocks and air mattresses and we are booked. We don't want to buy some more boring bunkbeds, we want the best private thing we know you will appreciate!!!</p>
<p>With your help, we will build beautiful design capsules where you can sleep with all the things you appreciate. Depending on how much you help us, we will be able to build more gadgets like lights, tables, blinds, music, ventilation, better mattresses, better sheets..... and imagination is the limit. </p>

You love to feel secure and want your belongings to remain yours. So here it is! a small private space to sleep and keep your stuff hazard free.</p><p>In our capsules we will build a locker where your backpack and stuff fit just right and secured. a real confortable mattress, nice study lamp and lets see what else you help us to put in.</p><div>
<p>With your support, we will build as many cozy capsules we can. with US$4500 we will be able too build 8 capsules.  this will be the first of 30 units. we would like to costume design a few of them and hopefully you will want to have your own costume design capsule.</p>

I am currently a college student, but I have had to take the semester off due to my financial aid being inexplicably and drastically cut. I wanted to make the best of it, though, by working and volunteering during my semester off. I have grown up hearing stories about my family volunteering on the Hudson River Clearwater Sloop (the late Pete Seeger's project) and have always wanted to go myself. </p>

<p><b>What is Clearwater?</b></p>
<p>-Clearwater is a project founded by folk singer Pete Seeger. In his efforts to clean up the Hudson River, NY's primary water source, he purchased a sailboat to sail up and down the river.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Chattanooga, TN is a great place to live and is known for being the scenic city. We have the world's largest fresh water aquarium at the Tennessee Aquarium, Rock City, Ruby Fall, Lookout Mountain to see 7 states, Civil war battlefield sites, vibrant art district, and many outdoor activities such as hiking, biking, fishing, rafting, mountain climbing, caving (spelunking), boating, shopping, and great places to eat. But more importantly Chattanooga is a thriving place for economic and progressive changes. We have a free electric shuttle system downtown, a bike share system, TVA Solar <span>Initiatives</span>, electric car charging stations, CSA farms, rooftop gardens, and many eco-conscious businesses. We currently have a few small composting efforts with a handful of businesses that support urban gardens and CSA Crab Tree Farms which coordinate to support the Food bank. I would like to see this model on a large scale for Chattanooga and cities across the nation:</p>
<p><strong>About Me </strong></p>
<p>I grew up around in southern Missouri around the Branson area and my grandparents were both in the agriculture business. My paternal grandfather owned and operated several chicken hatcheries and my maternal grandpa raised crops and hogs in southeast Missouri near the boot heel. Both of my parents were health and environmentally conscious and raised me to respect animal, the environment, and people. Additionally, I have been a vegetarian for nearly my entire my life and I have a strong interest in <span>sustainability,</span> helping animals, and protecting the environment, which led me to study Psychology, Sociology, and Mechanical Engineering at the University of Missouri and the University of Tennessee-Chattanooga.

<p>Even if you don't think you produce much food waste or just have an apartment or condo balcony, you will find that you will compost more than you thought in any easy, affordable, and possibly even lucrative manner by selling compost soil, worm castings, and worm tea which are very valuable to the gardening and farming community.</p>

<ul>
<li>Waste: According to the Environmental Protection Agency, “In 2010, Americans generated about 250 million tons of trash and recycled and composted over 85 million tons of this material, equivalent to a 34.1 percent recycling rate.” Generally, most Americans can recycle and compost at least 30-50% of their waste. Additionally, nearly 40% of all food produced in the U.S. today goes uneaten [nrdc.org]. According to the USDA, food operations such as restaurants, cafeterias, fast food service, and caterers contributed to 86 billion pounds of wasted food in 2008. Americans throw out approximately one quarter of their food and beverages purchased which equates to a loss of nearly $2,000 per year for a family of four [nrdc.org].</li>
<li>Food: According to Feeding America, 1 in 6 people in America go hungry and 46.2 million people were in poverty in 2011. A new study, <a href=""http://feedingamerica.org/hunger-in-america/hunger-studies/map-the-meal-gap.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Map the Meal Gap</a>, released by Feeding America shows that children continue to struggle with hunger in every county in the nation. More than 1,000 counties have more than one in four children who are at risk of hunger.</li>
<li>By recycling, composting, reusing, and pre-cycling we can reduce over 50% of waste going to the landfill and use this waste in a <span>constructive</span> manner to help hungry and low-income Americans receive a hand up along with a hand out. By incorporating this type of system we can increase the quantity and quality of food going to children and families in need and provide sustainable, economic assistance to provide self-reliance and independence. </li>

Chattanooga, TN is a great place to live and is known for being the scenic city. We have the world's largest fresh water aquarium at the Tennessee Aquarium, Rock City, Ruby Fall, Lookout Mountain to see 7 states, Civil war battlefield sites, vibrant art district, and many outdoor activities such as hiking, biking, fishing, rafting, mountain climbing, caving (spelunking), boating, shopping, and great places to eat. But more importantly Chattanooga is a thriving place for economic and progressive changes. We have a free electric shuttle system downtown, a bike share system, TVA Solar Initiatives, electric car charging stations, CSA farms, rooftop gardens, and many eco-conscious businesses. We currently have a few small composting efforts with a handful of businesses that support urban gardens and CSA Crab Tree Farms which coordinate to support the Food bank. I would like to see this model on a large scale for Chattanooga and cities across the nation:
About Me 
I grew up around in southern Missouri around the Branson area and my grandparents were both in the agriculture business. My paternal grandfather owned and operated several chicken hatcheries and my maternal grandpa raised crops and hogs in southeast Missouri near the boot heel. Both of my parents were health and environmentally conscious and raised me to respect animal, the environment, and people. Additionally, I have been a vegetarian for nearly my entire my life and I have a strong interest in sustainability, helping animals, and protecting the environment, which led me to study Psychology, Sociology, and Mechanical Engineering at the University of Missouri and the University of Tennessee-Chattanooga. I have a BGS in Math, Engineering, and Psychology from MU and I am working on a post-baccalaureate Mechanical Engineering degree at UTC.
When I was a child I attended Earth Day events, watched Disney Movies, enjoyed playing outside, and learning about people, plants, animals, and especially dinosaurs. Like many boys I dreamed of building amazing vehicles like that of Back to the Future or a more conventional, historic, and innovative vehicle such as a human-electric hybrid vehicle that incorporates pedaling, solar charging, regenerative braking, and plug-in charging. My observations about the world around me and culture media don't just give me ideas and inspiration, it teaches me to see how people can change the world by working together by incorporating small ideas to make a big impact. I am able to see the interconnectedness of the life on this planet and how every decision we make has a global impact. If you have heard of Immanuel Kant's Moral Imperative you may get what I mean.

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We rely on our volunteers, members, donors, grantors, and small foundations to create, implement, and maintain our community stewardship projects in San Francisco. Our continued work together is vital to the bay area's biodiversity, even in a high-density urban environment.

<h3>Ensure that the city's rich biodiversity is available for future generations</h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We here at Nature in the City live our mission of caring for urban biodiversity and connecting San Franciscans to nature. We lead nature walks, hold events for children and families, offer eco-literacy training and volunteer opportunities, and are a resource for community groups wishing to start their own nature-based endeavors.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Our flagship project, the Green Hairstreak Corridor, was initiated by lepidopterist Liam O'Brien in 2006 and continues to be managed by Nature in the City. The corridor connects Green Hairstreak butterfly populations, which have been isolated due to urban development, by planting its host plants in strategically-located street parks. These parks are cared for by local residents and schoolchildren. Since the project's launch, the population of Green Hairstreak butterflies and their associated insects and birds, has increased two-fold. </span></p>

The Tardigrade is an extremophile able to survive in space, but can it survive entering the Earth's atmosphere?

Project Summary

Project Stratobear is a senior project for three students at The Marine Academy of Science and Technology. The project will center around the goal of studying the upper atmospheric effect on Tardigrades (Waterbears). A Tardigrade is a small water dwelling micro-animal with six legs which have been hypothesized to have come from outer space. The Tardigrade is an extremophile which means it can survive in extreme conditions of heat and cold. The project involves constructing a weather balloon probe that would mimic the atmospheric effects of space to Earth entry.
 
Because of our project's diverse needs our group has chosen to split up the work and specialize in different areas:
 
Joseph Nardone- Team leader and probe housing engineer. The design challenge he will face is designing containment that will not only hold the Tardigrades into a specific area, but will also expose them to the atmospheric environment.
 
Nate Librizzi- Launch and recovery engineer. The design challenge he will face is designing a method to return the probe not only slowly, but also upright to preserve the Tardigrade containment.
 
Connor Varley- Navigation and camera operation engineer. The design challenge he will face is enabling the probe to be tracked while it flies and then relocated in a timely fashion.
 
Mentors- Our group has multiple mentors spanning from MakerSpace members to the famous naturalist Mike Shaw. With these mentors we are able to gain expert information on different topics we will be exploring.
What We Need and What You Get
Our group needs funding for multiple items:
-The probe and related equipment. Things such as helium, the balloons, parachutes, and PVC materials.
-The camera equipment and navigation equipment.
-Microscopes and other laboratory equipment to conduct the Tardigrade research.
-Website hosting and domain name fees.
 
On the right you can see some of our amazing perks. With these perks you will be receiving a reward for helping us fund our senior project.
The Impact
Our goal with our research is to support the Panspermia Hypothesis. This states that life exists throughout the universe and is spread about by meteorites, asteroids, comets, and planetoids. Tardigrades have already been proven to survive in space, but we want to see if they could survive entry.

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""></p></div>","We are an architect, a
designer and a photographer who believe in transformation and design, therefore
Transfodesign. We consider that most of the things can be given a second
opportunity (be it recycled, up-cycled or reused), and have a purpose, socially
and ecologically. Plus, that most of
the problems can be solved by design. We promote our concept giving workshops, lectures, events etc, but
also by offering projects and products, be it commercial or social. Please visit
www.transfodesign.info to find out more.
What is Trashkitchens?
Trashkitchens is a
satellite event planned during the BCN Design Festival.  The event itself will
take place at our shared workshop space, located in the wider center of Barcelona. During two days (15th and 16th
of October), five teams   will create mobile kitchens from salvaged
material. Each team will predesign the projects and they will need to produce their
ideas during the event delivering a fully functional product. Currently,
we are in the process of contacting the future participants. But don't worry we
will keep you posted on the groups selected.
Our Transfofriends and other design lovers will be able to follow the whole
building process, as the event will be open to the public. Additionally, the outstanding, we are
absolutely confident they will be, installations will be publicly presented on the 17th of October, when you will  see the kitchens in action and taste the great
dishes prepared in them. UPDATES! 1. We have just finished the website on the event! Please visit it! www.trashkitchens.info2. We have our first participants: System Design Studio (http://www.systemdesignstudio.com/) and students from the school of design Elisava led by Jose F López-Aguilar3. Participation also confirmed by Bussoga disseny surreal (http://www.bussoga.com) + Cristina Noguer (http://www.cristinanoguer.com/). 4. Liken Studio (http://www.likenstudio.com/) has also joined in, completing our list of participants!

Why do we think it is important?
People have little knowledge what recycling and reuse of materials can give
them, what are the benefits and how it can influence their daily life. Plus we think that mobile kitchens are fun, one can cook in motion. So with Trashkitchens the visitors can get information in an fun and creative way. Showing a
design process from the very beginning to the end, is the most direct and
personal way of communication. That way the idea that the trash can be
converted into good and useful design is easily transmitted. Our ambition is to establish a regular event where creatives will have the
opportunity to meet and develop one concept, and explore the many ways the materials can
be transformed.  
What We Need & What You Get
Our goal is 6500 US$. It is basically what we need
to have this event going. We need this amount in order to:

cover travel and accommodation costs for
participants living outside BCN
provide meals during the event
give tools and materials (the few that will not
be salvaged)
cover logistics and transportation costs
have good advertising
inaugurate the exhibition of the ""trashkitchens""

As we are organizing this event by ourselves, with no public funding, we need your help. And, even if we do not manage to raise here all the money we need, we have
all the intention of making this event happen. So other sources are being
sought after. 
Since you are a good transfofriend, we want to give you something in
return, something you will remember us for. So choose your favorite perk and
claim it. AND, no matter which perk you choose, you will receive our eternal
gratitude.
Bonus
If you help us achieve our goal, all the additional funding will go to
MakeaTuVida in order to bring the fantastic exhibition Rehogar to Barcelona. It
would be great if we can make a joint display with them. For more information,

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style="""">Auf einer 3 Hektar großen Pachtfläche in Berlin-Gatow im äußersten Westen Berlins wächst und gedeiht seit Anfang 2013 das Projekt SpeiseGut. Dabei handelt es sich um das erste Berliner Projekt im Rahmen der so genannten „Solidarischen Landwirtschaft“. Die Teilnehmerinnen und Teilnehmer dieser Wirtschaftsgemeinschaft erhalten für einen monatlichen, über ein Jahr festgelegten Beitrag wöchentliche Lieferungen der angebauten Produkte. Obst, Gemüse, Kartoffeln, Kräuter und Blumen wachsen nach strengen ökologischen Richtlinien ausschließlich unter freiem Himmel: regional, ökologisch und verantwortungsvoll, frei von Agrarsubventionen, Gentechnik und dem Einfluss von Großkonzernen.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';""> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style="""">Bei der Ernte wird darauf geachtet, dass alle Produkte unabhängig von Größe, Form und Farbe den Verbraucher erreichen. Zum Vergleich: In der herkömmlichen Landwirtschaft wird bis zur Hälfte des angebauten Obstes und Gemüses schon während der Ernte aussortiert und vernichtet, weil Farbe, Größe oder Form nicht mit den Erwartungen des Großhandels übereinstimmen. Gegen diese verantwortungslose Verschwendung will SpeiseGut ein Zeichen setzen. Für den Erfolg ist SpeiseGut auf die tatkräftige Unterstützung der Teilnehmerinnen und Teilnehmer angewiesen. An mindestens drei Tagen im Jahr sollen sie im Rahmen von Arbeitseinsätzen z. B. jäten, Obst und Gemüse ernten oder Früchte einwecken. Solidarische Landwirtschaft ist auch Mitmach- und Erlebnis-Landwirtschaft, bei der jeder sehen, riechen und fühlen kann, wie das später gegessene Obst und Gemüse wächst und wo es herkommt.</span></p>

SpeiseGut wants to set an example against this irresponsible waste of food. To be successful, SpeiseGut needs the participants' support. They should help at least 3 days per year by weeding, harvesting fruit and vegetables or by preserving fruit. Solidary Farming is agriculture to experience and to participate in: Everybody can see, smell and feel the fruit and vegetables grow, and knows where they come from.</span></p>

Chaque semaine, les participantes et participants de cette communauté économique sont fournis en produits cultivés, contre une contribution mensuelle fixe s'étendant sur une année.

Worum geht es diesem Projekt?
Auf einer 3 Hektar großen Pachtfläche in Berlin-Gatow im äußersten Westen Berlins wächst und gedeiht seit Anfang 2013 das Projekt SpeiseGut. Dabei handelt es sich um das erste Berliner Projekt im Rahmen der so genannten „Solidarischen Landwirtschaft“. Die Teilnehmerinnen und Teilnehmer dieser Wirtschaftsgemeinschaft erhalten für einen monatlichen, über ein Jahr festgelegten Beitrag wöchentliche Lieferungen der angebauten Produkte. Obst, Gemüse, Kartoffeln, Kräuter und Blumen wachsen nach strengen ökologischen Richtlinien ausschließlich unter freiem Himmel: regional, ökologisch und verantwortungsvoll, frei von Agrarsubventionen, Gentechnik und dem Einfluss von Großkonzernen.
 
Bei der Ernte wird darauf geachtet, dass alle Produkte unabhängig von Größe, Form und Farbe den Verbraucher erreichen. Zum Vergleich: In der herkömmlichen Landwirtschaft wird bis zur Hälfte des angebauten Obstes und Gemüses schon während der Ernte aussortiert und vernichtet, weil Farbe, Größe oder Form nicht mit den Erwartungen des Großhandels übereinstimmen. Gegen diese verantwortungslose Verschwendung will SpeiseGut ein Zeichen setzen. Für den Erfolg ist SpeiseGut auf die tatkräftige Unterstützung der Teilnehmerinnen und Teilnehmer angewiesen. An mindestens drei Tagen im Jahr sollen sie im Rahmen von Arbeitseinsätzen z. B. jäten, Obst und Gemüse ernten oder Früchte einwecken. Solidarische Landwirtschaft ist auch Mitmach- und Erlebnis-Landwirtschaft, bei der jeder sehen, riechen und fühlen kann, wie das später gegessene Obst und Gemüse wächst und wo es herkommt.
 
Die Mitarbeit ersetzt jedoch nicht die maschinelle Unterstützung, die z. B. zur Pflege des Bodens, zum großflächigen Aussetzen von Kartoffeln usw. erforderlich ist. Damit alle Arbeiten auf dem Acker erledigt werden können, plant SpeiseGut den Kauf eines Schleppers und Beetfräse.
 
Was sind die Ziele und wer ist die Zielgruppe?
Das Ziel ist die Anschaffung eines kleinen Schleppers und einer Beetfräse, um aufwändige bäuerliche Aufgaben schneller und effizienter bearbeiten zu können. Die Erfolgsaussichten des Projekts SpeiseGut werden damit erheblich gesteigert. Davon profitieren alle aktuellen und künftigen Teilnehmerinnen und Teilnehmer der Wirtschaftsgemeinschaft. 
 
Warum sollte man diese Projekt unterstützen?
SpeiseGut ist ein Gegenentwurf zur herkömmlichen, subventionsabhängigen Landwirtschaft. Das Projekt ermöglicht den Bezug von regionalem, ökologischem, pestizid- und gentechnikfreiem Obst und Gemüse in Berlin. Ein dauerhafter Erfolg von SpeiseGut kann ein Anreiz für andere Bäuerinnen und Bauern im ganzen Land sein, ebenfalls Solidarische Landwirtschaftsprojekte ins Leben zu rufen.
 
Wieviel Geld brauchen wir, und was passiert damit?Für unsere geplante Crowdfunding - Aktion benötigen wir etwa 15.000 €. Mit diesem Geld werden wir den Traktor sowie unsere Beetfräse anschaffen können. Wir hoffen, dass wir dann noch etwas Geld übrig haben, um anstehende Wartungen in der nächsten Saison durchführen zu können.
Wer steckt hinter dem Projekt?
Der Initiator und Inhaber des Landwirtschafts- und Gemüsebaubetriebs SpeiseGut ist Christian Heymann. Der gelernte Bauer ist seit 15 Jahren im Öko-Landbau tätig. SpeiseGut ist sein erstes Projekt als Selbstständiger.

SpeiseGut? What is this project about?
The project SpeiseGut thrives and prospers on 2.5 rented acres in the far West of Berlin- Gatow since the beginning of 2013. It is Berlin's first project that uses the concept of ""solidary farming"". The participants of this economic community receive weekly deliveries of the cultivated products that are generated according to strict ecological guidelines for a monthly fee that is specified for 12 months. Fruit, potatoes and other vegetables, herbs and flowers are produced regionally, ecologically and responsibly.They grow in open air, free from agricultural subsidy, genetic engineering and the influence of conglomerates.
 
When we harvest, we make sure that products of all sizes, forms and colours reach the consumers. For comparison: In conventional agriculture, up to half of the crop is sorted out during the harvesting, because size, colour or form are not according to the standards of wholesale trade. SpeiseGut wants to set an example against this irresponsible waste of food. To be successful, SpeiseGut needs the participants' support. They should help at least 3 days per year by weeding, harvesting fruit and vegetables or by preserving fruit. Solidary Farming is agriculture to experience and to participate in: Everybody can see, smell and feel the fruit and vegetables grow, and knows where they come from.
 
Nevertheless, human participation does not replace the aid of machines, which are needed for taking care of the soil, an extensive planting of potatoes etc.. SpeiseGut is planning to buy a haulier and a rotary cutter so that all work on the land can be done.
 
Aims of the project and its target group:
We want to buy a haulier and a rotary cutter in order to do our agricultural work faster and more efficient. This way, SpeiseGut's prospects of success can be enhanced considerably, and, furthermore, all recent and future participants of our economic community can benefit from this purchase.
 
Why you should support this project: 
SpeiseGut is an alternative to conventional farming and agricultural subsidy. The projects offers its participants from Berlin the acquisition of regional, ecological fruit and vegetables that are free from pesticides and not genetically engineered. SpeiseGut's succes could be an inspiration to farmers across the country and Europe to start more projects on solidary farming.
 
How much money do wee need, and what happens with it?
We aim to acquire roundabout 15.000€ via crowdfunding in order to buy a tractor and a rotary cutter. We hope to also have some money left for the maintenance of the machines in the next season.
 
Who is the person behind this project?
Initiator and Owner of SpeiseGut is Christian Heymann. He is a farmer with 15 years of experience in ecological farming. SpeiseGut is his first project as an independent contractor.

Quel est l'intérêt de ce projet ?
Sur un terrain sous bail de trois hectares situé à Berlin-Gatow, aux confins de l'ouest de Berlin, le projet SpeiseGut se développe et prospère depuis début 2013. Il s'agit là du premier projet berlinois dans le cadre de la dénommée „agriculture solidaire“. Chaque semaine, les participantes et participants de cette communauté économique sont fournis en produits cultivés, contre une contribution mensuelle fixe s'étendant sur une année. Les fruits, légumes, pommes de terre, herbes et fleurs poussent exclusivement en plein air, en accord avec des règlements écologiques exigeants : une agriculture régionale, écologique et responsable, dépourvue de subventions agricoles, d'OGM et de l'influence de grandes entreprises.
 
Lors de la récolte, nous prenons soin à ce que tous les produits, indépendamment de leur taille, forme et couleur, atteignent le consommateur. En comparaison, dans l'agriculture conventionnelle, jusqu'à la moitié des fruits et légumes cultivés sont déjà triés et détruits lors de la récolte, à cause de leur couleur, taille ou forme qui ne correspond pas aux attentes de la grande distribution. SpeiseGut veut offrir une solution à ce gâchis irresponsable. La réussite de SpeiseGut dépend aussi du soutien actif des participantes et participants. Pendant au moins trois jours dans l'année, ils s'engagent à rejoindre des interventions de sarclage, de récolte de fruits et légumes ou de mise en conserve de fruits. L'agriculture solidaire est aussi une agriculture participative et expérimentée, qui permet à chacun de voir, sentir et éprouver le parcours et l'origine des fruits et légumes dégustés par la suite.
 
La main d'œuvre ne remplace toutefois pas le soutien mécanique, nécessaire notamment à l'entretien du sol, aux plants de pommes de terre étendus etc. Pour pouvoir effectuer tous les travaux sur le terrain, SpeiseGut a prévu l'achat d'un tracteur et d'une fraiseuse de labour.
 
Quels sont les objectifs et quelle est la cible visée ?
L'objectif est l'acquisition d'un petit tracteur et d'une fraiseuse de labour afin de rendre les travaux fermiers exigeants plus rapides et efficaces. Cela ferait considérablement augmenter les chances de réussite du projet SpeiseGut. Tous les futurs et actuels participantes et participants de la communauté économique en profitent. 
 
Pourquoi soutenir ce projet ?
SpeiseGut est une alternative à l'agriculture conventionnelle, dépendante de subventions. Le projet permet d'avoir accès à des fruits et légumes écologiques sans pesticides et OGM à Berlin. Un succès à long terme du projet SpeiseGut peut motiver d'autres agricultrices et agriculteurs dans l'ensemble du pays à initier à leur tour des projets d'agriculture solidaire.
 
Combien d'argent nous faut-il, et qu'allons-nous en faire ?
Pour notre projet de production communautaire avisé, il nous faut approximativement 15.000 €. À l'aide de cet argent, nous allons pouvoir acquérir le tracteur ainsi que notre fraiseuse de labour. Nous espérons qu'il restera de quoi payer la maintenance des appareils pour la saison prochaine.
 
Qui est responsable du projet ?
L'initiateur et le propriétaire de l'entreprise agricole et légumière SpeiseGut s'appelle Christian Heymann. Il est agriculteur de formation et actif dans l'agriculture biologique depuis 15 ans. SpeiseGut est le premier projet à son compte.

О чём этот проект?
На арендуемой площади размером в 3 гектара, на окраине западного Берлина (Берлин-Гатов), с начала 2013 года реализуется проект «SpeiseGut» (досл. перевод – «питайся хорошо»). Речь идёт о так называемом «Солидарном сельском хозяйстве». «SpeiseGut» является самым первым проектом такого рода в Берлине. Участники этого сообщества за определённую месячную плату на протяжении всего года еженедельно получают продукцию, выращиваемую на этих землях. Фрукты, овощи, картофель, зелень и цветы выращивают строго по экологическим технологиям, без применения ГМО, и исключительно под открытым небом. Проектом не предусмотрено использование аграрных субсидий и связей с крупными корпорациями. Наш девиз: обеспечение потребителя региональной и экологически чистой продукцией.
Особое внимание при сборе урожая уделяется тому, чтобы все продукты независимо от их величины, формы и цвета достигли потребителя. Для сравнения: в традиционном сельском хозяйстве почти половина всех выращенных овощей и фруктов отсортировывается и уничтожается (выбрасывается) ещё во время сбора урожая, из-за того что их цвет, размер или форма не соответствуют стандартам оптовой торговли. «SpeiseGut» абсолютно против такого безответственного расточительства. Успех этого проекта во многом зависит от активной поддержки его участников, которые должны 3 дня в году, принять участие в процессе выращивания, уборки овощей и фруктов, а также их переработки (консервация). Солидарное сельское хозяйство предусматривает не только работу, но и является местом для новых интересных встреч, общений, ощущений. Место, где каждый может увидеть и узнать, как выращиваются овощи и фрукты, понюхать и потрогать их. 
Но поддержка со стороны участников, конечно, не может заменить применение сельскохозяйственной техники, которая необходима, к примеру, для обработки почвы, для высадки картофеля и т.п. Для выполнения сельскохозяйственных работ большого масштаба «SpeiseGut» планирует приобрести трактор-тягач и машину для вспашки.
Цели сбора средств и куда они будут направлены?
Целью является приобретение маленького трактора-тягача и пахотной машины, подготавливающей почву к посадкам, которые помогут быстрее и эффективнее выполнять сельскохозяйственные работы. Таким образом шансы на успех проекта «SpeiseGut» значительно увеличатся. Отсюда извлекут выгоду не только настоящие, но и будущие участники этого сообщества.
Почему нужно поддержать этот проект?
«SpeiseGut» - является инициативой абсолютно противоположной по своему характеру традиционному сельскому хозяйству, полностью зависящему от государственных субсидий. Этот проект позволяет получать региональную и экологически чистую (без применения пестицидов и ГМО) продукцию в пределах Берлина. Продолжительный успех проекта «SpeiseGut» сможет стать примером для других сельскохозяйственных производителей (фермеров) по всей стране, стартовать подобные проекты по солидарному сельскому хозяйству.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h1>25 million bamboo trees</h1>
<h3>Our goal: </h3>
<h4>We want to plant 1,500 bamboo saplings by spring 2014, laying the foundations for a bamboo forest of 25 million bamboo trees – a real powerhouse and an almost inexhaustible green resource.

<p> </p>
<h3>Sustainable economy: </h3>
<p>Over the past 2 years, we have built a bamboo factory at our site in Wuyishan. There, we extract highly-effective anti-inflammatory bamboo extracts for the cosmetics, pharmaceutical and nutritional industries from our organic bamboo.</p>
<h3>Bamboo Power:</h3>
<p>Bamboo plants are interconnected via their roots. Generations of trees join to create a forest – a rapidly-growing, mythical place of power. Fascinated by this energy, in 2010 Patrick Neuenschwander and I decided to invest all of our wealth and entrepreneurship in becoming bamboo producers. Since then, we have been chasing the business idea of using our own organically-certified bamboo forest to produce leaves for the extraction of bamboo essences. Bamboo extracts have a very strong anti-inflammatory effect and are therefore a very interesting raw material for the cosmetics, pharmaceutical and nutritional industries.</p>
<h3>Venture:</h3>
<p>This spring, after a 2-year test period and with the help of investors, our bamboo factory began operations at the foot of our own small organically-certified bamboo forest (50 hectares) in Wuyishan (China). Using organic bamboo extracts and following intensive self-testing (<a href=""http://www.selbstversuche.ch"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.selbstversuche.ch</a>), we have developed a unique health and beauty drink. Bamboo leaf extracts contain innumerable ingredients which mean that our bamboo drink has an anti-inflammatory effect and strengthens the body from within.<br/>The development of our production means that our Need for organically-certified bamboo leaves has increased. We also want to continue to harvest our raw materials sustainably and to be able to trace each leaf directly back to its origin in the forest. We are launching this Indiegogo campaign to attract capital and commitment for our vision. </p>

Pisa, our  clean energy project is at risk of shut-down.

Pedicab
Pisa is the first and only ecological-tourism service in Pisa, a
project born and driven by the will to propose a new resource, a new
way to live the city and the urge of creating a job for ourselves. A
kind of enterprise already present in the most important cities of
the World since decades. A dream that risks to end despite our
efforts.

It's
been three years since we, Roberto (pedicab driver) and Gianni
(photographer and graphic designer, graduate in Foreign Languages)
both unemployed, began this adventure. We invested every resource
at our disposal, succeeding in buying our first rickshaw e
winning the battle against bureaucracy to obtain permissions. We
have been dealing with technical, logistical and bureaucratic
problems by ourselves, despite the economical crisis and the absence
of help by institutions. We began the experimentation of the
project working for free or by tips
and we immediately received a positive and strong feedback,
great beyond our expectations. 


Our
Eco-Tour aimed at the discovery of the cultural and artistic
treasures of the city of Pisa has been enthusiastically appreciated
by thousands of tourists from all over the World. The project has
been completely supported and encouraged by citizens, by retailers,
by the press and the Internet, as well as numerous sponsors we still
thank for the precious help they are giving us. Determined to create
a collaboration between the restaurants and enterprises of the city
center, we extended the project creating a illustrated guide aimed at
the discovery of the legendary heritage of the city, its typical
products and food. 

Many
of the tourists who tried our Eco-Tour stayed longer in the city,
more than they programmed, instead of traveling somewhere else once
they had visited the Leaning Tower. We are an example of how good
initiatives can improve the economy of a city, step by step.

However,
because of serious economical problems and the absence of a necessary
help by institutions, the future of the project is uncertain. We
can't afford any more the maintenance expenses for the vehicle (there
are no rickshaw factories in Italy), for a place to safely keep it,
to pay our home rent and we are risking eviction. We risk to lose
what we managed to achieve so far just for a few (2-3) thousands of
Euros, necessary to carry on with the project.
We
have no clue on how to go on and we risk to lose a valuable chance to
create an occupation. If we weren't left all by ourselves dealing
with all these problems, today we could have been offering a job to
other people too.
This
is why we're asking for a concrete help by Institutions. We address
this letter to our fellow citizen
Italian Prime Minister  Enrico Letta, to Regional Government
President of Tuscany Enrico Rossi, to Major of Pisa Marco Filippeschi
and anybody who wishes to help us. We have a strong will to work,
to propose initiatives, to offer our potential. We firmly believe in
our project and we just don't want to give up.

We are looking for and we welcome the collaboration of anybody who
wishes to help us making our dream come true with a free
donation or simply helping us sharing our campaign.

from the organizers:


This is an invitation to change everything.
In September, world leaders are coming to New York City for a UN summit on the climate crisis. UN Secretary­ General Ban Ki-­moon is urging governments to support an ambitious global agreement to dramatically reduce global warming pollution.
With our future on the line and the whole world watching, we’ll take a stand to bend the course of history. We’ll take to the streets to demand the world we know is within our reach: a world with an economy that works for people and the planet; a world safe from the ravages of climate change; a world with good jobs, clean air and water, and healthy communities.
To change everything, we need everyone on board.Sunday, September 21 in New York City. Join us.

<p><strong><a href=""http://alianzaarkana.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Alianza Arkana</a> is a Peruvian NGO with nearly 3 years of experience successfully implementing community-based projects in the areas of environmental justice and human rights, sustainable waste management, and intercultural education. This program will be implemented with leadership from 3 Shipibo communities and in partnership with our sister NGO, the <a href=""http://chaikuni.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Chaikuni Institute of Permaculture</a>.</strong></p>
<p>The Shipibo are an indigenous people who live on the Ucayali River, a main tributary of the Amazon. They are famed artisans and healers and traditionally were skilled hunters, gatherers, and subsistence agriculturalists - but they are now facing the challenges of a deteriorated forest, pollution, and ensuing economic pressures.</p>
<p>Together, we are crafting a community-led model of eco-social abundance rooted in Permaculture and indigenous wisdom. <span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 81);"">Permaculture is an ethical design science that creates regenerative and resilient habitats by mimicking the patterns and processes found in nature - in essence it is human ingenuity wedded to the wisdom of the wild</span><b>.</b>  Permaculture teaches us that by taking care of the Earth, the people, and the future we can help to create a world of abundance and regeneration. <span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 81);"">Indigenous wisdom teaches the same</span><b>.</b> By integrating the two, we are creating lasting and positive change in the Amazon for generations to come.</p>

<p><strong>After decades of environmental and social devastation, a seed of hope is germinating in the Peruvian Amazon among indigenous youth who are reclaiming the diverse natural, cultural, social, and spiritual commonwealth of their ancestors.</strong></p>
<p>The SEED Project is creating opportunities for the rising generation of Shipibo to be catalysts for positive change in their communities. Through an <span style=""color: #ff0051;"">innovative training program integrating indigenous wisdom with Permaculture design</span>, Alianza Arkana and Chaikuni are supporting the Shipibo to develop forest gardens, fire-breaks, and integrated pest- and waste-management systems capable of providing food sovereignty, community cohesion, and a biodiversity-rich, climate-resilient landscape. </p>
<p><span style=""color: #ff0051;"">Over the next year, these motivated and inspiring young people will dedicate themselves to working with their communities to develop 10 acres of Permaculture forest gardens, plant over 15,000 trees</span> and kickstart the process of regeneration for this heavily degraded landscape. They will also ensure their financial stability by cultivating Amazonian superfoods and medicinal plants and partnering with ecosocial businesses to gain access to local, regional and international markets.</p>
<p>To put it into perspective, one acre of Rainforest yields $60 of timber once. One acre for grazing yields an owner $400 per year until the soils are too degraded or compacted to provide good quality pasture. One acre of renewable medicinal plants and fruits is capable of yielding an estimated $2400 per year indefinitely. The average Shipibo family has a yearly income of $1300.</p>
<p>We have already conducted the first phase of a Permaculture training program with a group of young Shipibo pioneers - <a href=""http://chaikuni.org/the-seed-project/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">check out the blog for more details</a>. These graduates are now in possession of the knowledge and techniques to lead their communities on the path to regeneration.</p>

<h2 style=""font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin-top: 2em;"">What We Are Up Against</h2>
<p><strong>The destruction of the Amazon Rainforest is a familiar concept to us all, but less known are the extreme challenges faced by the indigenous people, such as the Shipibo, who continue to live in these places once the forest is gone.</strong></p>
<p>For the Shipibo communities we work with, their daily reality is in stark contrast to the contemporary view of indigenous communities co-existing in harmony with lush tropical Rainforests. Charred earth, deforestation, pollution and vast invasive grasslands now characterize the landscapes on the edge of what we know as the Amazon Rainforest - one of the most biodiverse regions on the planet.</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://alianzaarkana.org/marketing/indiegogo/image-4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><p><strong>Sadly, many young people here have never even seen a primary forest.  Elders speak in somber tones of the timber, mining, and oil industries; the industrial agriculture, commercial fishing and cultural imperialism that have plundered the land and rivers while disintegrating their cultures and way of life.</strong>  They reminisce about the abundant flora and fauna of their youth, the pure water, the fertile soils and clean air. This is not the environment their grandchildren live in now.</p>
<p>The current generation of Shipibo is the first to face severe challenges of poverty, food insecurity, disease and malnutrition. Many are leaving their communities in search of employment, disconnecting from their culture and often ending up working for the very same industries responsible for the destruction of their forest home.</p>
<p style=""color: #ff0051;"">These are the costs of “development” which have transformed healthy, vibrant forests, cultures and people into a patchwork of degradation, contamination, and scarcity.</p>
<p>But these Permaculture pioneers will demonstrate that a new model of development IS possible - one that co-creates environmental and social prosperity through a union of the ancient and the contemporary.</p>

Who We Are
Alianza Arkana is a Peruvian NGO with nearly 3 years of experience successfully implementing community-based projects in the areas of environmental justice and human rights, sustainable waste management, and intercultural education. This program will be implemented with leadership from 3 Shipibo communities and in partnership with our sister NGO, the Chaikuni Institute of Permaculture.
The Shipibo are an indigenous people who live on the Ucayali River, a main tributary of the Amazon. They are famed artisans and healers and traditionally were skilled hunters, gatherers, and subsistence agriculturalists - but they are now facing the challenges of a deteriorated forest, pollution, and ensuing economic pressures.
Together, we are crafting a community-led model of eco-social abundance rooted in Permaculture and indigenous wisdom. Permaculture is an ethical design science that creates regenerative and resilient habitats by mimicking the patterns and processes found in nature - in essence it is human ingenuity wedded to the wisdom of the wild.  Permaculture teaches us that by taking care of the Earth, the people, and the future we can help to create a world of abundance and regeneration. Indigenous wisdom teaches the same. By integrating the two, we are creating lasting and positive change in the Amazon for generations to come.

To put it into perspective, one acre of Rainforest yields $60 of timber once. One acre for grazing yields an owner $400 per year until the soils are too degraded or compacted to provide good quality pasture. One acre of renewable medicinal plants and fruits is capable of yielding an estimated $2400 per year indefinitely. The average Shipibo family has a yearly income of $1300.
We have already conducted the first phase of a Permaculture training program with a group of young Shipibo pioneers - check out the blog for more details. These graduates are now in possession of the knowledge and techniques to lead their communities on the path to regeneration.
But Now They Need Your Help!
The SEED Project needs $26,000 to implement our combined vision for a new and thriving forest. Your contribution will help these young men and women to:

Establish a seed bank full of diverse Amazonian species including food, fiber  fuels, medicines, oils, etc.  $1 buys one seedling, $5 buys 100 seeds for their nurseries.

Buy the tools and materials they need.  $50 will buy essential tools for all our participants.

Organize mingas - shared community labor centered around achieving a common goal. $55 pays for one minga with food and drink for the whole community.

Give stipends to 10 participants and help them focus their time and energy on regenerative ecosocial entrepreneurship as an alternative to working for the extractive industries responsible for their degraded landscapes.  $133 pays one participant to implement Permaculture systems in their community for one month, including:

fire breaks
agroforestry
assisted natural regeneration
irrigation
waste management systems

Build a community nursery at a cost of $300
Create a local cooperative to market Amazonian crops
Lay the foundation for a resilient local economy based on non-timber forest products.

What We Are Up Against
The destruction of the Amazon Rainforest is a familiar concept to us all, but less known are the extreme challenges faced by the indigenous people, such as the Shipibo, who continue to live in these places once the forest is gone.
For the Shipibo communities we work with, their daily reality is in stark contrast to the contemporary view of indigenous communities co-existing in harmony with lush tropical Rainforests. Charred earth, deforestation, pollution and vast invasive grasslands now characterize the landscapes on the edge of what we know as the Amazon Rainforest - one of the most biodiverse regions on the planet.
Sadly, many young people here have never even seen a primary forest.  Elders speak in somber tones of the timber, mining, and oil industries; the industrial agriculture, commercial fishing and cultural imperialism that have plundered the land and rivers while disintegrating their cultures and way of life.  They reminisce about the abundant flora and fauna of their youth, the pure water, the fertile soils and clean air. This is not the environment their grandchildren live in now.
The current generation of Shipibo is the first to face severe challenges of poverty, food insecurity, disease and malnutrition. Many are leaving their communities in search of employment, disconnecting from their culture and often ending up working for the very same industries responsible for the destruction of their forest home.
These are the costs of “development” which have transformed healthy, vibrant forests, cultures and people into a patchwork of degradation, contamination, and scarcity.
But these Permaculture pioneers will demonstrate that a new model of development IS possible - one that co-creates environmental and social prosperity through a union of the ancient and the contemporary.
Perks: Our Way Of Saying Thank You
We want to thank you for your generosity by sending you a unique piece of the Amazon and even offer you the chance to come and experience the Rainforest's magic first-hand!
We can't wait to plant these seedlings in your name. Help us grow over 15,000 trees!
Note:  Each of the handmade items are unique and one of a kind. All photos of handmade items are examples for illustration purposes and are not the exact item you will receive.
Planting Seeds Is Just The Beginning...
These Permaculture pioneers must demonstrate the ancestral wisdom they have revived and the Permaculture techniques they have learned to prove how effective they are and inspire and motivate others.
Through farmer-to-farmer dissemination of these methods the positive impact will grow, year after year, incorporating friends, family and neighbors while expanding from the field to the landscape level.
Please help us nurture these seeds of hope and grow this vision of regeneration!

The Impact
On the surface, this project directly relates the concept of nutrition through proper food choices to health and wellness through integration with the Rahma Clinic’s health care mission.  On a further cultural level, this project will communicate and educate wellness choices through lifestyles related to self-sufficiency skills, edible landscape design, and native plant knowledge.

This project will integrate perennial edible landscaping into the urban fabric showcasing: > Use of perennial plant species to reduce annual maintenance of propagation, cultivation and planting needs > Use of native species and ground covers to reduce watering needs  > Use of multi-story design to utilize vertical growing space without expensive built infrastructure  >   Use of diverse plant products for self-mulching and self-fertilizing (maintenance of site integrity).

In a larger sense, you'll help us provide proof that this concept is viable anywhere- a template for changing the world, one rooftop, one power bill at a time. 
We've got numbers to back up our projections and a solid plan. Check it out on our website at www.sfenergycooperative.com/how-it-works/san-fr...


Contributions are key, but we need promotional help too.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Dan Mohlenhoff, also known as ""Cowboy Dan"". I started Water4Wells in 2004. It went great until the economy went south. I was able to get into a nice home and drive a decent car ('65 Corvette Stingray). By 2009 I had sold the car, was living on credit cards, and looking at foreclosure on my home. Now that the economy is getting up some steam again I am anxious to get back to work. I am still in my home but everything else is gone. I am now driving a ""practical"" car (Honda Element). </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I stll have all the equipment for testing for groundwater. I need money for advertising and operating expenses for the first three months. $15,000 wlll be spent on advertising. For all the years I was successful I have had a deal worked out with an outfit in Arizona that puts me in 50 different publications every week for $5,000.00 per month. I will rent a truck for operations in the beginning. I also need to hire a helper. I have a guy I have used for the past couple of years who is willing to do piece work, making him very affordable.</p>
<p>I wish I had some kind of perk or incentive to offer but the service I provide is very unique. If you have a piece of land in Nevada or Arizona we will come and find a spot for you to drill a well if you donate $1200.00 or more.</p>
<p>I'm not sure we will raise the $35,000 we are targeting. If we don't half that will accomplish what we have set out to do which is to get Water4Wells up and running at full capacity again.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Having gone through some very tough times these past few years I have learned to be humble. The humility I have learned obligates me to give back at a level to which I was previously averse.</p>
<p>My goal is to eventually be able to provide my services for free or at drastically reduced prices for the Native American communities in Arizona who are literally forced to carry water for miles and miles because they cannot afford to keep drilling until they get lucky enough to find water in an area that is very sparsely hydrated. Methods used in those areas now are water witching (proven to be ineffectual) and the ""poke and hope"" method; where they drill in a spot picked either at random or some other nonsensical method and hope they find water before they run out of pipe for the rig.</p>
<p>Once that goal is accomplished I want to take my services to some of the depressed areas in the world like Africa where people are dying of thirst because they don't have potable water. One of the advantages of using the technology I employ is that it does not detect salt water, a common problem with water in Africa.</p>
<p>All things happen for a reason. I think I was put through these hard times to help me appreciate my success. I hope to get this new lease on life so I may enhance the lives of others, rather than just getting a bunch of cool stuff for myself.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I realize not everyone can help and that some of you may not be inclined to donate if you don't get some little gadget in return. If that is the case just use the share tools to let others you know about my campaign and give them the chance to help me and a whole bunch of very deserving people get a new lease on life.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The one to two hour workshops will be appropriately tailored to each age group, kindergarten to twelfth grade. Workshops can also be adapted to more closely augment what a particular class is covering in the classroom. In all of the workshops, critical thinking and problem solving skills will be cultivated through group discussions and brainstorming sessions. Each workshop will end with a hypothetical design charrette, in which students will be challenged to develop creative solutions to the environmental issues impacting their communities using information learned in the workshops.</p>

<h3><strong>About us</strong></h3>
<p>The Urban Ecological Literacy workshop program will be led by Educational Director Scott Kellogg and Executive Director Stacy Pettigrew. Kellogg and Pettigrew designed and implemented a $200,000 EPA 2004 Brownfield Cleanup Award awarded to the Rhizome Collective for the Grove Landfill Cleanup in Austin, Texas. They authored the book “Toolbox for Sustainable City Living” (South End Press, 2008). A leading expert and innovator in the fields of urban sustainability and regenerative ecosystems, Kellogg has lectured and taught workshops at numerous universities and conferences throughout the country. He holds a M.S. from Johns Hopkins University.</p>

<h2>Workshop Descriptions</h2>
<h3 class=""NoParagraphStyle"">
<strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Aquaculture and Aquatic Ecosystem Science</span></strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">  </span>
</h3>
<p class=""NoParagraphStyle"">Using a modeled aquatic ecosystem, this module demonstrates the relationships between the biological, chemical, and physical components of an aquatic ecosystem and its inhabitants. The model ecosystem will be contained within a greenhouse and will consist of a series of tanks filled with re-circulating water.  Each tank will represent a different type of freshwater aquatic environment, such as a<strong> pond, stream habitat, or wetland</strong>, and will contain an array of organisms found in each of those ecotypes.  Wastes produced by fish living in the tanks will be converted by the activity of microorganisms into nutrients for plants co-habitating the system.</p>
<p class=""NoParagraphStyle""> </p>
<p class=""NoParagraphStyle"">By studying and interacting with this simulated ecosystem, students will develop an awareness of</p>
<ul>
<li>nutrient cycling and contaminant transport in aquatic environments, </li>
<li>the role of sewage and agricultural runoff in the eutrophication of bodies of water,</li>
<li>fish biology,</li>
<li>the hydrological cycle,</li>
<li>the importance of watersheds,</li>
<li>aquatic invertebrate’s function as indicators of ecosystem health, </li>
<li>the connection between the health of local aquatic environments and drinking water quality</li>
<li>small scale aquaculture’s potential as a susainable alternative to the depletion of global fisheries and its promise as a “green” urban micro-industry.  </li>
</ul><p class=""NoParagraphStyle""> <img alt=""Aquaculture System by Mary Darcy"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://alloveralbany.com/images/Radix%202012%20aquaculture%201st%20floor.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3 class=""NoParagraphStyle""> <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Energy</span></strong>
</h3>
<p class=""NoParagraphStyle"">This module will take a critical look at global energy issues and assess the pros and cons of conventional and alternative energy sources. </p>
<p class=""NoParagraphStyle"">Emphasis will be placed on renewable, non-polluting, and locally producible energy sources, such as solar, wind, and biofuels.  Functioning examples of each of these technologies will be on display, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>a passive solar oven,</li>
<li>wind turbines,</li>
<li>waste vegetable oil burning vehicles,</li>
<li>small scale biogas digesters, and</li>
<li>technologies that efficiently and cleanly use wood for heating and power generation. </li>
</ul><p class=""NoParagraphStyle""> </p>
<p class=""NoParagraphStyle"">The idea that technologies may either be environmentally harmful or benign depending on their use, scale, and context will be stressed.  Additionally, the causes and impacts of global climate change will be discussed, particularly within the context of energy use decisions.  Furthermore, students will become familiar with such critical concepts as carbon neutral and carbon negative energy strategies.</p>
<p class=""NoParagraphStyle""> </p>
<h3 class=""NoParagraphStyle""> <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Sustainable Food Systems</span></strong>
</h3>
<p class=""NoParagraphStyle"">This module will cover issues of local sustainable food production, including methods for raising vegetables, mushrooms, and small livestock.  An emphasis will be put on creating intensive, small scale food production systems that can be carried out with limited access to space. Broader issues of food security and nutrition will be integrated into the discussion. </p>
<p class=""NoParagraphStyle""> </p>
<p class=""NoParagraphStyle"">Students will learn the basics of small scale animal husbandry, including feeding, cleaning, and sheltering chickens, rabbits, and goats.  The use of easily accessible waste products as feed stocks and the appropriate integration of animals into an urban environment will be examined.</p>
<p class=""NoParagraphStyle""> </p>
<p class=""NoParagraphStyle"">Students will also learn about the fungal kingdom and the ecological significance of fungi in the environment, particularly their role in waste reduction and nutrient cycling.  Mushroom’s potential to turn waste products into valuable protein sources through fungi’s metabolic processes, and the role fungi can play in the remediation of toxins will be covered.   Students will inoculate a straw-filled bag with oyster mushrooms, a common edible mushroom species, which afterwards they can bring back to their own classroom to watch grow. </p>
<p class=""NoParagraphStyle""> </p>
<p class=""NoParagraphStyle"">In addition, organic vegetable gardens and a functioning rainwater collection system for use in conjunction with food production will be displayed.  Students will become aware of the impacts of soil erosion and the importance of good soil conservation practices.  Class participants will become familiar with the concept of brownfields and possibilities for remediation and reuse of brownfields for urban food production.</p>
<p class=""NoParagraphStyle""> </p>
<h3 class=""NoParagraphStyle""><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Waste</span></strong></h3>
<p class=""NoParagraphStyle"">This module explores how common organic waste products can be converted into soil, energy sources, and feed stocks for animals.  Class participants will:</p>
<ul>
<li>learn the basics of home-scale backyard composting, such as determining the proper balances and sources of carbon and nitrogen. </li>
<li>witness and interact with a worm composting system that converts food wastes into a nutrient rich fertilizer which improves soil quality and can be used in the remediation of soil-based toxins. </li>
<li>observe a black soldier fly composting unit, which rapidly converts putrescent wastes, such as meat and dairy, into compost and produces insect larvae as a feed for chickens and fish. </li>
</ul><p class=""NoParagraphStyle""> </p>
<p class=""NoParagraphStyle"">Larger discussions will be incorporated that examine problems with conventional waste disposal, and how organic waste buried in landfills contributes to greenhouse gas emissions.  </p>

How their consumption of food, energy, and production of waste are related to and dependent upon global ecological processes
 
 
The one to two hour workshops will be appropriately tailored to each age group, kindergarten to twelfth grade. Workshops can also be adapted to more closely augment what a particular class is covering in the classroom. In all of the workshops, critical thinking and problem solving skills will be cultivated through group discussions and brainstorming sessions. Each workshop will end with a hypothetical design charrette, in which students will be challenged to develop creative solutions to the environmental issues impacting their communities using information learned in the workshops.

The Radix Center is located in New York State’s Capital District.  Its three main cities are Albany, Schenectady, and Troy.  The School Districts for each of these cities are respectively ranked 658th, 672nd, and 683rd out of New York State’s 697 school districts.  
RadixCenter workshops will support struggling schools by providing an educational experience meant to excite and inspire students - an experience that could change the course of lives.
 
Budget
This funding will allow us to offer these workshops to area schools for free.  The budget will cover personnel (outreach to schools, preparing for and teaching the workshops) supplies, and insurance.  To offer 2 classes a week, our total budget is around $10,000 per semester.  This campaign is to get us started, we will use this assistance to help leverage other support from foundations and local businesses.  If less money is raised, the number of classes will be scaled back accordingly.   
 
About us
The Urban Ecological Literacy workshop program will be led by Educational Director Scott Kellogg and Executive Director Stacy Pettigrew. Kellogg and Pettigrew designed and implemented a $200,000 EPA 2004 Brownfield Cleanup Award awarded to the Rhizome Collective for the Grove Landfill Cleanup in Austin, Texas. They authored the book “Toolbox for Sustainable City Living” (South End Press, 2008). A leading expert and innovator in the fields of urban sustainability and regenerative ecosystems, Kellogg has lectured and taught workshops at numerous universities and conferences throughout the country. He holds a M.S. from Johns Hopkins University.
 
Because we believe that a transition to a more environmentally sustainable future is critical, we (Kellogg and Pettigrew) have invested our own money and time into building the Radix Center over the past year and a half.  We volunteer daily to caretaking the living systems at the Center, giving tours and classes to neighbors and school groups, maintaining the website and accounting, and expanding project.  This funding will enable the Radix Center’s first regularly scheduled youth workshops.  We are really excited to see this come to fruition!
 
If you are unable to make a donation, you can still help!

Workshop Descriptions

Aquaculture and Aquatic Ecosystem Science  

Using a modeled aquatic ecosystem, this module demonstrates the relationships between the biological, chemical, and physical components of an aquatic ecosystem and its inhabitants. The model ecosystem will be contained within a greenhouse and will consist of a series of tanks filled with re-circulating water.  Each tank will represent a different type of freshwater aquatic environment, such as a pond, stream habitat, or wetland, and will contain an array of organisms found in each of those ecotypes.  Wastes produced by fish living in the tanks will be converted by the activity of microorganisms into nutrients for plants co-habitating the system.
 
By studying and interacting with this simulated ecosystem, students will develop an awareness of

nutrient cycling and contaminant transport in aquatic environments, 
the role of sewage and agricultural runoff in the eutrophication of bodies of water,
fish biology,
the hydrological cycle,
the importance of watersheds,
aquatic invertebrate’s function as indicators of ecosystem health, 
the connection between the health of local aquatic environments and drinking water quality
small scale aquaculture’s potential as a susainable alternative to the depletion of global fisheries and its promise as a “green” urban micro-industry.  
 
 Energy

This module will take a critical look at global energy issues and assess the pros and cons of conventional and alternative energy sources. 
Emphasis will be placed on renewable, non-polluting, and locally producible energy sources, such as solar, wind, and biofuels.  Functioning examples of each of these technologies will be on display, including:

a passive solar oven,
wind turbines,
waste vegetable oil burning vehicles,
small scale biogas digesters, and
technologies that efficiently and cleanly use wood for heating and power generation. 
 
The idea that technologies may either be environmentally harmful or benign depending on their use, scale, and context will be stressed.  Additionally, the causes and impacts of global climate change will be discussed, particularly within the context of energy use decisions.  Furthermore, students will become familiar with such critical concepts as carbon neutral and carbon negative energy strategies.
 
 Sustainable Food Systems

This module will cover issues of local sustainable food production, including methods for raising vegetables, mushrooms, and small livestock.  An emphasis will be put on creating intensive, small scale food production systems that can be carried out with limited access to space. Broader issues of food security and nutrition will be integrated into the discussion. 
 
Students will learn the basics of small scale animal husbandry, including feeding, cleaning, and sheltering chickens, rabbits, and goats.  The use of easily accessible waste products as feed stocks and the appropriate integration of animals into an urban environment will be examined.
 
Students will also learn about the fungal kingdom and the ecological significance of fungi in the environment, particularly their role in waste reduction and nutrient cycling.  Mushroom’s potential to turn waste products into valuable protein sources through fungi’s metabolic processes, and the role fungi can play in the remediation of toxins will be covered.   Students will inoculate a straw-filled bag with oyster mushrooms, a common edible mushroom species, which afterwards they can bring back to their own classroom to watch grow. 
 
In addition, organic vegetable gardens and a functioning rainwater collection system for use in conjunction with food production will be displayed.  Students will become aware of the impacts of soil erosion and the importance of good soil conservation practices.  Class participants will become familiar with the concept of brownfields and possibilities for remediation and reuse of brownfields for urban food production.
 
Waste
This module explores how common organic waste products can be converted into soil, energy sources, and feed stocks for animals.  Class participants will:

learn the basics of home-scale backyard composting, such as determining the proper balances and sources of carbon and nitrogen. 
witness and interact with a worm composting system that converts food wastes into a nutrient rich fertilizer which improves soil quality and can be used in the remediation of soil-based toxins. 
observe a black soldier fly composting unit, which rapidly converts putrescent wastes, such as meat and dairy, into compost and produces insect larvae as a feed for chickens and fish. 
 
Larger discussions will be incorporated that examine problems with conventional waste disposal, and how organic waste buried in landfills contributes to greenhouse gas emissions.",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p dir=""LTR""><span lang=""en-us""><span style=""font-family: Times New Roman;"">For most people, Marcellus Shale gas drilling, (what many people call ""fracking""), is an idea more than a daily reality.  We set up the Marcellus Shale Documentary Project because wanted people to understand how the introduction of this industry has affected the lives and lifestyles of people in gas areas, how it affects the air and water in and beyond those areas, and how those effects may be felt by all of us in the years to come.</span></span></p>
<p dir=""LTR""><span lang=""en-us""><span style=""font-family: Times New Roman;"">So since late 2011, a team of six photographers have been documenting the advance of natural gas drilling in Pennsylvania, telling the story from a wide variety of angles and perspectives.  We have been collecting the accounts and stories of the</span></span><span lang=""en-us""> <span style=""font-family: Times New Roman;"">people</span></span><span lang=""en-us""><span style=""font-family: Times New Roman;""> who are most directly affected by gas drilling - the people who live and work in these areas.  The stories we have uncovered, are real, moving, and beautifully articulated.</span></span></p>

<p dir=""LTR""><span lang=""en-us""><span style=""font-family: Times New Roman;"">The images will travel to venues throughout Pennsylvania, New York, and other areas, where gas drilling is either under way, or is being considered. The exhibit will be a staging ground for meetings, forums and symposia at which the public will be able to learn more about the industry and its consequences, intended and unintended.  Many of the venues at which we would like to show this work are non-traditional sites with no budget for staging exhibitions such as this.</span></span></p>

Pennsylvania is experiencing the rapid expansion of a major industry aimed at extracting deposits of natural gas from deep underground.  The industry brings prosperity to some, not least the companies doing the drilling, but the process is still controversial, and may have unintended negative health and environmental consequences on local and regional levels.  We are daily subject to material intended to shape our view of the industry, but there is a lot we don't know.
For most people, Marcellus Shale gas drilling, (what many people call ""fracking""), is an idea more than a daily reality.  We set up the Marcellus Shale Documentary Project because wanted people to understand how the introduction of this industry has affected the lives and lifestyles of people in gas areas, how it affects the air and water in and beyond those areas, and how those effects may be felt by all of us in the years to come.
So since late 2011, a team of six photographers have been documenting the advance of natural gas drilling in Pennsylvania, telling the story from a wide variety of angles and perspectives.  We have been collecting the accounts and stories of the people who are most directly affected by gas drilling - the people who live and work in these areas.  The stories we have uncovered, are real, moving, and beautifully articulated.

The net product is twofold: a travelling exhibition at which people will be able to discuss openly, and without coercion or intimidation, the subject of gas drilling, along with their neighbors, friends, interested parties, experts, and so on; and a permanent archive recording for posterity the impact of the gas industry.  The exhibit will include a book summarizing the project.  The more we can travel the exhibit, the more people we can reach - we would like to get the work shown not only in traditional venues for photographic exhibitions, but into schools, libraries, community centers, town halls - places where people can see first hand what to most of them is just a distant idea.
The images will travel to venues throughout Pennsylvania, New York, and other areas, where gas drilling is either under way, or is being considered. The exhibit will be a staging ground for meetings, forums and symposia at which the public will be able to learn more about the industry and its consequences, intended and unintended.  Many of the venues at which we would like to show this work are non-traditional sites with no budget for staging exhibitions such as this.
Your contribution will help enable us to travel the show widely, as well as to continue shooting footage to expand the historical archive.

What We Need & What You Get
The money we raise will serve two purposes: first, to enable us to travel the work to the non-traditional venues described above; and second, to enable us to continue photographing - we have covered a lot of ground in the last nine months, but there is still so much more to tell.
Even if we do not meet our goal, the more we raise, the more places we will be able to achieve.
The Impact
Your contribution will help ordinary people to understand what gas drilling actually looks like; how it affects our homes, our environment, our communities; who benefits and who doesn't.  The more we raise, the more stories we tell, and the more people we will reach.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Through the introduction and promotion of modern beekeeping we intend to improve  agricultural yields throughout the community. In turn, <b>beekeepers and farmers will both benefit.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>In fact, a recent <a href=""http://www.gbfund.org/sites/default/files/Honey%20Care%20Fact%20Sheet_0.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">study</a> has shown that for every <b>$1 USD</b> invested into an East African honey enterprise there are<b> $15.48 USD</b> in social impact returns.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Economic Impact</b><br/></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>With your help we will train over <b>300 women</b> to hand-craft candles and Kanga Totes, providing much needed income for our partners.<br/></p>
<p>Currently our out grower network consists of<b> over 400 beehives.</b></p>
<p><b><i>We have already loaned 150 beehives to youth and female rural cooperative groups.</i><br/></b></p>
<p>With your help our operations  will support the
beekeeping activities of <b>over</b> <b>1500 beekeepers over the next year</b>. </p>
<p>We have reached out to  <a href=""http://www.kiva.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kiva.org</a> to expand our micro finance program, and we have partnered with a Tanzanian parastatal, <a href=""http://www.sido.go.tz/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">SIDO</a> (Small Industries Development Organization), as well as other governmental and NGO partners to support our processing

<p>Other Benefits:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><b>providing a second source of income for rural women</b></li>
<li><b>less labor intensive than traditional beekeeping </b></li>
<li><b>seasonal and part-time, allowing women to manage other responsibilities</b></li>
<li><b>provides economic incentive to not over-exploit forests</b></li>
<li><b>spurs development of related industries (carpentry, sewing, candle making, beauty and pharmaceutical products)</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Once we have recruited and adequate number of beekeepers we plan to export our honey to the United States, Europe and Middle East.</p>
<p><b>Environmental
Impact</b></p>
<p>Today Tanzania’s bee product sector is in a unique
position in the world market. Its honey catchment area is free of pesticides and pollution; Tanzanian bee products are widely considered organic. <b>Your support for our efforts will create a  financial incentive to ensure that Tanzania's bee forage areas stay pristine, healthy and safe from deforestation.</b></p>

<p></p>
<ul>
<li>reach out and include even more beekeepers and rural cooperatives </li>
<li>invest in modern equipment to better support the rural Tanzanian beekeeping industry</li>
<li>obtain certifications to ensure that our products are of the highest quality, and meet the highest international ethical and environmental standards</li>

Beekeeping is the fastest and lowest cost way to double household earnings in rural Tanzania that is also socially and environmentally sustainable. 
Tanzania has over 2 million traditional artisanal beekeepers, but they suffer from lack of access to modern equipment, training, finance and markets. Tanzanian beekeeping has yet to meet its poverty-alleviating potential. 
The benefits of our intervention extend far beyond charity. We aim to demonstrate that Tanzania has the human capacity and the natural resources to sustainably and ethically produce high quality bee products. With your help we plan to show the government, development banks, exporters, retailers and financiers that investing in rural beekeeping is a win-win economically, socially and environmentally.
Who We Are

Tanganyika Apicultural Limited was founded by Olujimi (Jimi) Akindele and Philemon Kiemi. Jimi Akindele is from New York City, studied Biology and Philosophy at Stanford in California and is a Fordham Law graduate.  He first moved to Tanzania in 2011 to support private sector driven approaches to promoting renewable energy and economic development in rural Tanzania. Philemon Kiemi is a Tanzanian from Singida where he and his brothers learned beekeeping from their father while growing up on their farm. Upon graduating from Sokoine University of Agriculture Philemon Kiemi returned to Singida to train beekeepers across the region in modern beekeeping practices and to give back to his community. 

Why Are Bees So Great?
We are not the first to to promote beekeeping as a powerful and sustainable way to support rural livelihoods in the developing
world. See Bees for Development. See also another amazing crowdfunded bee project in Brazil.
Bees are not only a source of honey, wax and
propolis (what bees use to seal their hives), but they are also essential pollinators, they help plants have sex to make fruits, vegetables and nuts
for us to eat. In fact beekeeping has been shown to increase nearby agricultural yields by up to 300%.  See also another UN Report.

Through the introduction and promotion of modern beekeeping we intend to improve  agricultural yields throughout the community. In turn, beekeepers and farmers will both benefit.

In fact, a recent study has shown that for every $1 USD invested into an East African honey enterprise there are $15.48 USD in social impact returns.

Economic Impact

With your help we will train over 300 women to hand-craft candles and Kanga Totes, providing much needed income for our partners.
Currently our out grower network consists of over 400 beehives.
We have already loaned 150 beehives to youth and female rural cooperative groups.
With your help our operations  will support the
beekeeping activities of over 1500 beekeepers over the next year. 
We have reached out to  Kiva.org to expand our micro finance program, and we have partnered with a Tanzanian parastatal, SIDO (Small Industries Development Organization), as well as other governmental and NGO partners to support our processing
and packaging operations and thereby increase access to markets for beekeepers across the region.
Other Benefits:

less labor intensive than traditional beekeeping 
seasonal and part-time, allowing women to manage other responsibilities
provides economic incentive to not over-exploit forests
spurs development of related industries (carpentry, sewing, candle making, beauty and pharmaceutical products)

Once we have recruited and adequate number of beekeepers we plan to export our honey to the United States, Europe and Middle East.
Environmental
Impact
Today Tanzania’s bee product sector is in a unique
position in the world market. Its honey catchment area is free of pesticides and pollution; Tanzanian bee products are widely considered organic. Your support for our efforts will create a  financial incentive to ensure that Tanzania's bee forage areas stay pristine, healthy and safe from deforestation.
What
We Need
Your donations and purchases will allow us to:


reach out and include even more beekeepers and rural cooperatives 
invest in modern equipment to better support the rural Tanzanian beekeeping industry
obtain certifications to ensure that our products are of the highest quality, and meet the highest international ethical and environmental standards




With your help we will also be able to support the development of value added products from beekeeping. We started with candles, but we are planning to make organic soaps, sustainable skin products and eco-friendly surfboard wax.
What You Get

1. Handmade Air-Purifying Candles


Most candles today are now made of paraffin, a petroleum product, which upon burning contributes what you might expect to the environment – and your lungs! Soy-based candles are also commonly available, but are often sourced from industrialized, genetically modified crops. 
Our beeswax candles are entirely sustainable, organic and natural. They are also purify the air by releasing negative ions which remove pollutants and allergens.

Beeswax candles were originally developed by European churches during the Middle Ages. Today we are inviting you to experience the benefits of old world candle-making together with the exotic natural aromas of African beeswax!
2. The Kanga Tote



Show your colors with the “Kanga Tote”. Kanga’s are a popular clothing item in Swahili Africa (Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda), though they are thought to have originated in the Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean. Kangas are noted for their print patterns as well as often featuring a mji or saying, e.g.:
Majivuno hayafai — Greed is never useful
Mkipendana mambo huwa sawa — Everything is all right if you love each other
Mwanamke mazingira tuanataka, usawa, amani, maendelo — We (women) want equality, peace, and progress
Our Kanga Totes are hand sewn by female entrepreneurs in Singida Tanzania. 
3. Trucker Hat


Sport your Support for Sustainable African Beekeeping with our Custom Trucker Hats!
4. Small Batch Organic Honey
We would like to thank our most committed contributors with our finest forest honey harvested from our apiaries. This honey is has a warm hazelnut brown hue and comes from the nectar of Singida’s flowering foliage: Itigi thickets, Mlonge trees, and Miombo forests.
5. Tanzanian Beekeeping Photo Album




From the shores of Lake Rukwa to the terraced hills of Moshi, enjoy an intimate view of the beekeeping practices across Tanzania with our hardcover bound photo collection of Tanzanian apiculture. 
5. Authentic Handmade Tanzanian Top-Bar Bee Hive


At Tanganyika Apicultural we are working to promote the usage of improved beehives, particularly the Tanzanian Top-Bar Hive, made from Tanzanian hardwoods. Top-bar hives are simple to install and maintain and are a fun introduction to beekeeping. Try it on your bees at home!

Over the years the Maio Biodiversity Foundation (FMB) has realised that directly involving local people in turtle guarding is one of the most effective ways to stop poaching. The main cause of poaching in Maio is unemployment, and the best way to stop this is by giving them a financial alternative. In the past we have also learned that these poachers can create strong links to turtles and get passionate about them once they are involved in working for their protection. Dozens of cases of ""poachers to protectors"" have shown us that after a seasons work protecting turtles, seeing the mothers nest and the babies hatch,  these ex-poachers fall in love with this ancient species and become the best spokespeople for turtle conservation, telling others in their community that they will never be able to kill a turtle again.</span></p>

We also created much needed job opportunities for the community members, as a guard or host family. This combination of practical education, direct protection and a turtle friendly source of income proved to be highly effective, and resulted in a 71% reduction in the mortality of nesting female turtles and a 91% reduction in poached nests in just one season!

</div></div>","Observation:
Lets see if we can manage to employ more poachers as guards! Since thanks to you we reached our goal in no time, we will use all aditional funds that come in to give more poachers a chance for change. 
In Maio we have more than 30 nesting beaches that have to patrolled, so we actually need more protectors on the beach!
Can we manage do employ a 6th poacher?

From Poacher To Protector
With the ""Poacher to Protector"" Initiative we plan to give sea turtle poachers an opportunity for change, by training and employing them as sea turtle protectors on Maio Island, Cape Verde, Africa.  In this campaign we wish to employ as many poachers as possible. Over the years the Maio Biodiversity Foundation (FMB) has realised that directly involving local people in turtle guarding is one of the most effective ways to stop poaching. The main cause of poaching in Maio is unemployment, and the best way to stop this is by giving them a financial alternative. In the past we have also learned that these poachers can create strong links to turtles and get passionate about them once they are involved in working for their protection. Dozens of cases of ""poachers to protectors"" have shown us that after a seasons work protecting turtles, seeing the mothers nest and the babies hatch,  these ex-poachers fall in love with this ancient species and become the best spokespeople for turtle conservation, telling others in their community that they will never be able to kill a turtle again.


The need to protect Maio´s turtle is urgent: In 2012 the island had the highest rates of killed females (40%) and poached nests (20%) in the country. However, in the 2013 sea turtle nesting season, FMB introduced a new conservation strategy on Maio. Turtle protection teams were placed in the coastal villages around the island and team members were hosted by local families. Their main job was to patrol turtle nesting beaches. The presence of the teams in each village was critical to raise awareness about the importance and threats to sea turtles. We also created much needed job opportunities for the community members, as a guard or host family. This combination of practical education, direct protection and a turtle friendly source of income proved to be highly effective, and resulted in a 71% reduction in the mortality of nesting female turtles and a 91% reduction in poached nests in just one season! For this amazing achievements FMB was and recently awarded with the ""Grassroots Conservation Award"" at the  35th International Sea Turtle Symposium in Dalaman, Turkey (April 2015) and is extremely proud to receive international recognition for its work.



By helping us create job opportunities for these people you will drastically reduce the number of turtles killed and eggs harvested this season, assuring the survival of a wonderful and charismatic endangered species, and you will help give someone the opportunity to change their life in a way that will have a deep impact on that person forever. Every year dozens of poachers come to us asking for jobs, but we always have to say that we simply do not have the money to employ them all. Lets change this, and give these people an opportunity for change.

<p>In August a group engineers, teachers and students will join the first team.  Together they will plant the orchards and gardens now possible due to team efforts of the previous two years.  Engineers will teach all students and others in the community how to build a hand pump from scratch, and install drip irrigation lines and rainwater catch systems.  Students from the US will build a library to house the books they are bringing so that students can continue reading and improving their English which is required for Tanzanian students to advance to secondary school.</p>

<p>Ignite the future of automotive transportation with WIKISPEED, the modular 100 mpg car company. With our 150 person global team, we are using the technology we developed to compete in the X Prize and our functional road-going prototypes as the launchpad to bring ultra-efficient, modular cars to the world with the <strong>100 mpg Comfortable Commuter Car</strong>, the <strong>WIKISPEED C3</strong>. We aim to deliver the C3 as a complete car for $17,995 and as a kit for $10,000; we need your backing to make that possible.</p>
<p><strong>We have 150 team members in 15 countries to help get this done.</strong></p>
<p>Currently we have working prototypes of each part that makes up the ultra efficient, ultra-low emissions, gasoline powered C3. The car is designed and manufactured in eight parts. We need to enhance each piece from prototype to production-ready part. Enhancing each part costs us right about $50,000 in prototyping tools, materials, and testing fees. We've set the launch minimum for this project at $50,000 (+5% to Indiegogo) to enable us to evolve our test chassis to the C3 chassis, the foundation of our C3 and the future of automotive manufacturing. When we pass that initial fundraising goal, every subsequent dollar goes to improving the engine module from prototype to C3 level—and so on for all eight modules. You are enabling us to deliver a fully tested, safe, and fun 100 mpg commuter car.</p>
<p><strong>Here's what your dollars build:</strong></p>
<p>Your money will specifically fund (1) ten additional crash tests, (2) fuel-efficiency testing, (3) materials for prototyping and testing, (4) expert reviews and fabrication, and (5) the additional tools required to make the future of automotive transportation happen right now. WIKISPEED is a registered automotive manufacturer and able to deliver complete vehicles in the United States and kits globally. Let's take ultra-efficient modular prototypes to the mainstream.

<span>Help fund a 2 acre parcel of land, greenhouse, laboratory, and processing center for research and development of cleaner processing methods, and potential uses for bamboo!

Not to mention the environmental impact a container ship has releasing enough CO2 for 50 million cars. Here is the proof.. A U.S. company pays $.50-$1.50  for a bamboo towel (see </span><a class=""ot-anchor"" href=""http://alibaba.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">alibaba.com</a><span>)  you pay $36.00 from a U.S. retailer</span><br/><br/><span><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1148.photobucket.com/albums/o566/abambooproject/bamboonomics_zps84ffca8f.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></span>
</h2>
<h3>WHY the HUGE markup? Well there are a lot of people to be paid in your products journey. Shipping is anywhere from $3,000-$6,000 dollars. Then there are customs, brokers, warehousing, and salesmen that all need to make money resulting in the $36.00 towel. If bamboo is sourced here, the “middlemen” and transportation affects are WIPED OUT. As a benefit you will also be saving our environment, creating jobs, and find additional uses for this wonder plant. After considering all the different factors when ordering from China; the United States can afford to be competitive.</h3>
<h3>This proof of concept is all that is needed to acquire second round grants and funding already committed to the project. You will help us become a local supplier to U.S. companies already producing bamboo flooring, clothing, skateboards, surfboards, diapers, and other products! You are lowering the price you pay for bamboo, ensure it is harvested RESPONSIBLY, move jobs back to the U.S. that already exist in China and UNLOCK the potential for bamboo bio fuels, bio mass, medicines, bio char, bio plastics and other products identified so far.</h3>
<h3>From there we go to a lease/purchase model of parcels of land with existing bamboo growing, and take advantage of the requests to ‘clear bamboo’ from private and public lands. WHile starting bamboo farms from scratch. We immediately service U.S. companies manufacturing bamboo products. If they aren’t that fast, we manufacture wood pellets for use as bio mass in the EU and this project is profitable from the start. All that is missing is the front end investment. All that is missing is YOUR help and commitment to green.</h3>
<h2>WHY??</h2>
<h3 class=""alignJustify""><span class=""font_8"">The U.S. currently has a tremendous imbalance of trade even as we import over 50 million dollars a year worth of bamboo shoots, poles, furniture, flooring, and other products. <br/><br/>We also have: massive unemployment, many abandoned small farms, overburdened landfills, organic waste disposal issues, receding water tables and diminishing water quality, severe soil erosion, material shortfalls, inequitable land distribution, worsening air pollution, etc.</span></h3>
<h3 class=""alignJustify""><span class=""font_8"">Americans Need Jobs. Building a domestic bamboo industry from the ground up creates jobs. Cleaner, greener, and with the promise of cleaning up our soil, air and water. That's Bamboo. </span></h3>
<h3 class=""alignJustify""><span class=""font_7""><span class=""bold"">The only roadblock is the political support and front end investment. Through the bamboo project, our goal is with your help, we will begin the bamboo industry here and now through the acquisition of land already growing Bamboo, setup of a bamboo processing center, and the setup of a bamboo research and development center. </span></span></h3>

<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Why Bamboo??</strong></h2>
<p>Bamboo is extremely versatile and already has made an impact worldwide. This plant is truly green. This plant is totally sustainable. This plant has a use in every industry. Popularity is growing every year. Imagine a plant growing up to 100 feet tall, being cut down and replenishing itself in 45 days. </p>
<p>I realize this is a spectacular claim. I know many will tell me the jury is still out. However, let us look at the facts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bamboo is one of the fastest growing plants on the planet. Bamboo can grow up to 2 feet per day and over 90 feet tall in one season.</li>
<li>Bamboo sequesters 35% more Co2 than trees.</li>
<li>Bamboo requires only one third of the water than cotton does. There is much less carbon associated with growing bamboo such as operating tractors in harvesting and maintenance than cotton. Unless American cotton can be genetically engineered to plant and pick itself, the cotton industry in America faces a dismal future.</li>
<li>Bamboo has no natural pests. Therefore, NO PESTICIDES.</li>
<li>Bamboo filters soil of contaminants and prevents soil erosion. Something we can use in the Gulf region prone to oil spills and still reeling from the effects of the BP Oil Spill.</li>
<li>Bamboo is flexible. It can be used in virtually any application such as bike frames, domes, and other products.</li>
<li>Bamboo is leterally stronger than steel and more durable than wood. It can be used as a composite, structural beams, flooring, scaffolding, supports, housing, car frames, and concrete reinforcement.</li>
<li>Bamboo is being used for clothing. Bamboo is soft, and anti-bacterial, it acts like a sponge whisking perspiration away from the skin.</li>
<li>Over 1.5 BILLION people use bamboo worldwide. Trade is worth over 5 billion per year and rising.</li>
<li>The United States is the LARGEST IMPORTER of Bamboo.</li>
</ol><p>Young seedlings cannot be imported into the United States unless they remain in quarantine for one year. These rules have prevented the supply of young plants to establish bamboo forests. This plant only flowers every 30 to 120 years, depending on the species. Companies like Booshoot in Seattle, Washington have conquered this obstacle by inventing new ways to propagate bamboo. These methods have proved to be the foundation of the Bamboo industry in the United States via projects like this and others.</p>
<p>Today with the renewed push towards greener solutions, bamboo is once again being considered. And with good reason- It is also growing in population as more consumers become eco-conscious.</p>
<p><strong>But Bamboo has received some bad press.</strong></p>
<p>Some of the methods used to breakdown bamboo to fiber are dirty. VERY chemically toxic. This is not the ONLY method used. Mechanically crushing the bamboo is also an option and we have another option. Steam.</p>
<div>
<p>Bamboo has also been accused of being an intrusive plant. There are 2 types of bamboo, runners and clumpers. Clumping bamboo does not spread. Running bamboo can be easily controlled via conventional methods or simple mad made divisions. </p>
<p>Bamboo can transform abandoned lands into working farms, and the current demand for bamboo is endless. Bamboo as an industry can create tons of thousands of jobs here in the U.S.</p>
<p><strong>We know this for a fact.</strong></p>
<p>These jobs exist in China serving OUR DEMAND. I mean that there are tens of thousands of workers in China and other countries whose daily work is harvesting or producing bamboo products for the United States market. Doesn’t this seem foolish to you? You haven’t even heard the punch line yet. This bamboo is being obtained from OVER harvested bamboo plantations. The consequences of this for the China environment are disastrous.</p>
<p>From harvesting to production, bamboo creates jobs in industries across the board in the U.S.</p>
<p>Retrofitting cotton harvesting equipment is easy and inexpensive. Everyone knows farmers must diversify. Bamboo as a crop has a market, and produces yields many times over that of current agriculture. It also shares a multi-industry demand, so bamboo is not dependent on one customer. While bamboo is a food, it does not compete as a food stock in the U.S. It is a safe crop.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1148.photobucket.com/albums/o566/abambooproject/Image16_zps0e8bbd26.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
<h3><strong>Today Bamboo is used in a variety of products at the same time what is known about bamboo and its true potential is in its infancy.</strong></h3>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1148.photobucket.com/albums/o566/abambooproject/Image7_zps71325241.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Our goal is to help this process along and quickly. We will achieve bamboo enlightenment through a very simple business model.</h3>
<p>Bamboo library: We have been compiling information on everything Bamboo, we have posted 10% on the internet so far. This library is already the largest collection of bamboo related materials and will contibute to grow for ALL to use. Please see <a href=""http://abambooproject.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">#abambooproject</a>.</p>
<p>We have studied and implemented these findings in many of our production and agriculture plans. We have created new systems, closed loop manufacturing systems, and clean breakdown processes utilizing steam. </p>
<p>We can't wait to uncover more. </p>
<p>Bamboo acquisition: in the southern U.S. bamboo grows wild. Public lands, and private land owners are willing to give us this timber. They call, we haul type of scenario. Or in some cases, we may lease or purchase the land. Remember, bamboo is renewable. It can replenish itself in as little as 45 days so our supply chain is readily available.</p>
<p>From there the bamboo is hauled to our processing center. Our processing center is envisioned at 5,000 sq. ft. to begin with, Expanding as our bamboo efforts grow.</p>
<p>In order to support growth we will begin manufacturing products that are already in demand and involve the least amount of handling. For example:</p>
<h3>
<strong>Biomass: </strong> Demand for biomass, most commonly in the form of wood pellets that can easily be transported, has leapt since the EU in 2007 set its 2020 climate goals.</h3>
<h3>
<strong>Fiber or Pulp: </strong>Used by the paper industry to offset their demand on forests, this use of bamboo is gaining rapid attention.</h3>
<h3>
<strong>Wood for consumer products: </strong>Flooring, skateboards, kitchen utensils, surfboards, furniture and other items. All are made with bamboo and imported every day. We can supply these companies manufacturing these products in the U.S.  For those companies that import these products are making green claims, the pressure will mount not only by the consumer questioning their greenness, but as the cost of transportation continues to rise, domestically sourced bamboo will become more cost efficient.</h3>
<h3>That equals more factories and <strong>MORE JOBS!</strong>
</h3>
<p><strong>It’s important to emphasize what I just explained…Through locally sourcing our own materials and selling the bamboo to the industries requiring the least amount of manufacturing makes this project profitable from the <em>start</em>. </strong></p>
<p>This finances the development of new “open source” methods and technologies and thus begins the explosion of bamboo into a U.S. industry. Additionally, we have second round financing ready once the pilot project is done. That's where we need <strong>YOUR</strong> help. From the popularity of the issue gaining more political support to every dollar raised you are bringing real awareness to the US acgriculture industry which is suffering due to drought, and bad political policy. This puts farmers to work, can reverse effects of global warming, and supply our needs SUSTAINABLY. </p>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1148.photobucket.com/albums/o566/abambooproject/Image16_zps07c6f2a7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Research and Development Center</strong> will consist of 2 acres of land, one small building, and a greenhouse. It is where the breakthroughs will occur, where the results of those breakthroughs will be shared with universities and industry.</p>
<p> Our research will include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bamboo pyrolysis. (Turning bamboo into an energy source by basically baking it similar to how a clay pot is made.)</li>
<li>Bamboo Charcoal as a filter for industrial and home application. Power plants and coal factories are already considering bamboo charcoal as a method of capturing pollutants being emitted.</li>
<li>Bamboo fibers. These fibers are already being currently used as textiles used in clothes, and linens, as fiber for toilet tissue, paper, and various other paper products as ‘pulp’.</li>
<li>Bamboo processing. Bamboo is a very heavy and woody plant. We have pioneered methods in clean processing utilizing stream, but there are others that show the promise of a more efficient system of processing. Replicating the digestive system of the Panda is one. Recently, universities started trying to identify the digestive enzyme that processes bamboo in pandas. Bamboo is 90 percent of a panda’s diet.</li>
<li>Bamboo as a construction material. There are several types of structural beams, plywood, flooring, doors and other building products made of bamboo on the market.  However, in many respects these materials are higher priced than their wood counterparts. We want to see the products affordable by all.</li>
</ol>
<p>While Bamboo is growing very popular in the U.S. it is still a somewhat segmented and niche following. Your help will bring the issue mainstream, with every job created in the U.S. bamboo proves itself. We hope and believe a good idea has merit just because people like you deem it worthy. We believe you will see that merit in this wonderplant.

Not to mention the environmental impact a container ship has releasing enough CO2 for 50 million cars. Here is the proof.. A U.S. company pays $.50-$1.50  for a bamboo towel (see alibaba.com)  you pay $36.00 from a U.S. retailer

WHY the HUGE markup? Well there are a lot of people to be paid in your products journey. Shipping is anywhere from $3,000-$6,000 dollars. Then there are customs, brokers, warehousing, and salesmen that all need to make money resulting in the $36.00 towel. If bamboo is sourced here, the “middlemen” and transportation affects are WIPED OUT. As a benefit you will also be saving our environment, creating jobs, and find additional uses for this wonder plant. After considering all the different factors when ordering from China; the United States can afford to be competitive.
This proof of concept is all that is needed to acquire second round grants and funding already committed to the project. You will help us become a local supplier to U.S. companies already producing bamboo flooring, clothing, skateboards, surfboards, diapers, and other products! You are lowering the price you pay for bamboo, ensure it is harvested RESPONSIBLY, move jobs back to the U.S. that already exist in China and UNLOCK the potential for bamboo bio fuels, bio mass, medicines, bio char, bio plastics and other products identified so far.
From there we go to a lease/purchase model of parcels of land with existing bamboo growing, and take advantage of the requests to ‘clear bamboo’ from private and public lands. WHile starting bamboo farms from scratch. We immediately service U.S. companies manufacturing bamboo products. If they aren’t that fast, we manufacture wood pellets for use as bio mass in the EU and this project is profitable from the start. All that is missing is the front end investment. All that is missing is YOUR help and commitment to green.
WHY??
The U.S. currently has a tremendous imbalance of trade even as we import over 50 million dollars a year worth of bamboo shoots, poles, furniture, flooring, and other products. We also have: massive unemployment, many abandoned small farms, overburdened landfills, organic waste disposal issues, receding water tables and diminishing water quality, severe soil erosion, material shortfalls, inequitable land distribution, worsening air pollution, etc.
Americans Need Jobs. Building a domestic bamboo industry from the ground up creates jobs. Cleaner, greener, and with the promise of cleaning up our soil, air and water. That's Bamboo. 
The only roadblock is the political support and front end investment. Through the bamboo project, our goal is with your help, we will begin the bamboo industry here and now through the acquisition of land already growing Bamboo, setup of a bamboo processing center, and the setup of a bamboo research and development center. 

 
Why Bamboo??
Bamboo is extremely versatile and already has made an impact worldwide. This plant is truly green. This plant is totally sustainable. This plant has a use in every industry. Popularity is growing every year. Imagine a plant growing up to 100 feet tall, being cut down and replenishing itself in 45 days. 
I realize this is a spectacular claim. I know many will tell me the jury is still out. However, let us look at the facts:

Bamboo is one of the fastest growing plants on the planet. Bamboo can grow up to 2 feet per day and over 90 feet tall in one season.
Bamboo sequesters 35% more Co2 than trees.
Bamboo requires only one third of the water than cotton does. There is much less carbon associated with growing bamboo such as operating tractors in harvesting and maintenance than cotton. Unless American cotton can be genetically engineered to plant and pick itself, the cotton industry in America faces a dismal future.
Bamboo has no natural pests. Therefore, NO PESTICIDES.
Bamboo filters soil of contaminants and prevents soil erosion. Something we can use in the Gulf region prone to oil spills and still reeling from the effects of the BP Oil Spill.
Bamboo is flexible. It can be used in virtually any application such as bike frames, domes, and other products.
Bamboo is leterally stronger than steel and more durable than wood. It can be used as a composite, structural beams, flooring, scaffolding, supports, housing, car frames, and concrete reinforcement.
Bamboo is being used for clothing. Bamboo is soft, and anti-bacterial, it acts like a sponge whisking perspiration away from the skin.
Over 1.5 BILLION people use bamboo worldwide. Trade is worth over 5 billion per year and rising.
The United States is the LARGEST IMPORTER of Bamboo.
Young seedlings cannot be imported into the United States unless they remain in quarantine for one year. These rules have prevented the supply of young plants to establish bamboo forests. This plant only flowers every 30 to 120 years, depending on the species. Companies like Booshoot in Seattle, Washington have conquered this obstacle by inventing new ways to propagate bamboo. These methods have proved to be the foundation of the Bamboo industry in the United States via projects like this and others.
Today with the renewed push towards greener solutions, bamboo is once again being considered. And with good reason- It is also growing in population as more consumers become eco-conscious.
But Bamboo has received some bad press.
Some of the methods used to breakdown bamboo to fiber are dirty. VERY chemically toxic. This is not the ONLY method used. Mechanically crushing the bamboo is also an option and we have another option. Steam.

Bamboo has also been accused of being an intrusive plant. There are 2 types of bamboo, runners and clumpers. Clumping bamboo does not spread. Running bamboo can be easily controlled via conventional methods or simple mad made divisions. 
Bamboo can transform abandoned lands into working farms, and the current demand for bamboo is endless. Bamboo as an industry can create tons of thousands of jobs here in the U.S.
We know this for a fact.
These jobs exist in China serving OUR DEMAND. I mean that there are tens of thousands of workers in China and other countries whose daily work is harvesting or producing bamboo products for the United States market. Doesn’t this seem foolish to you? You haven’t even heard the punch line yet. This bamboo is being obtained from OVER harvested bamboo plantations. The consequences of this for the China environment are disastrous.
From harvesting to production, bamboo creates jobs in industries across the board in the U.S.
Retrofitting cotton harvesting equipment is easy and inexpensive. Everyone knows farmers must diversify. Bamboo as a crop has a market, and produces yields many times over that of current agriculture. It also shares a multi-industry demand, so bamboo is not dependent on one customer. While bamboo is a food, it does not compete as a food stock in the U.S. It is a safe crop.
 
Today Bamboo is used in a variety of products at the same time what is known about bamboo and its true potential is in its infancy.

Our goal is to help this process along and quickly. We will achieve bamboo enlightenment through a very simple business model.
Bamboo library: We have been compiling information on everything Bamboo, we have posted 10% on the internet so far. This library is already the largest collection of bamboo related materials and will contibute to grow for ALL to use. Please see #abambooproject.
We have studied and implemented these findings in many of our production and agriculture plans. We have created new systems, closed loop manufacturing systems, and clean breakdown processes utilizing steam. 
We can't wait to uncover more. 
Bamboo acquisition: in the southern U.S. bamboo grows wild. Public lands, and private land owners are willing to give us this timber. They call, we haul type of scenario. Or in some cases, we may lease or purchase the land. Remember, bamboo is renewable. It can replenish itself in as little as 45 days so our supply chain is readily available.
From there the bamboo is hauled to our processing center. Our processing center is envisioned at 5,000 sq. ft. to begin with, Expanding as our bamboo efforts grow.
In order to support growth we will begin manufacturing products that are already in demand and involve the least amount of handling. For example:

Biomass:  Demand for biomass, most commonly in the form of wood pellets that can easily be transported, has leapt since the EU in 2007 set its 2020 climate goals.

Fiber or Pulp: Used by the paper industry to offset their demand on forests, this use of bamboo is gaining rapid attention.

Wood for consumer products: Flooring, skateboards, kitchen utensils, surfboards, furniture and other items. All are made with bamboo and imported every day. We can supply these companies manufacturing these products in the U.S.  For those companies that import these products are making green claims, the pressure will mount not only by the consumer questioning their greenness, but as the cost of transportation continues to rise, domestically sourced bamboo will become more cost efficient.
That equals more factories and MORE JOBS!

It’s important to emphasize what I just explained…Through locally sourcing our own materials and selling the bamboo to the industries requiring the least amount of manufacturing makes this project profitable from the start. 
This finances the development of new “open source” methods and technologies and thus begins the explosion of bamboo into a U.S. industry. Additionally, we have second round financing ready once the pilot project is done. That's where we need YOUR help. From the popularity of the issue gaining more political support to every dollar raised you are bringing real awareness to the US acgriculture industry which is suffering due to drought, and bad political policy. This puts farmers to work, can reverse effects of global warming, and supply our needs SUSTAINABLY. 

Research and Development Center will consist of 2 acres of land, one small building, and a greenhouse. It is where the breakthroughs will occur, where the results of those breakthroughs will be shared with universities and industry.
 Our research will include:

Bamboo pyrolysis. (Turning bamboo into an energy source by basically baking it similar to how a clay pot is made.)
Bamboo Charcoal as a filter for industrial and home application. Power plants and coal factories are already considering bamboo charcoal as a method of capturing pollutants being emitted.
Bamboo fibers. These fibers are already being currently used as textiles used in clothes, and linens, as fiber for toilet tissue, paper, and various other paper products as ‘pulp’.
Bamboo processing. Bamboo is a very heavy and woody plant. We have pioneered methods in clean processing utilizing stream, but there are others that show the promise of a more efficient system of processing. Replicating the digestive system of the Panda is one. Recently, universities started trying to identify the digestive enzyme that processes bamboo in pandas. Bamboo is 90 percent of a panda’s diet.
Bamboo as a construction material. There are several types of structural beams, plywood, flooring, doors and other building products made of bamboo on the market.  However, in many respects these materials are higher priced than their wood counterparts. We want to see the products affordable by all.

While Bamboo is growing very popular in the U.S. it is still a somewhat segmented and niche following. Your help will bring the issue mainstream, with every job created in the U.S. bamboo proves itself. We hope and believe a good idea has merit just because people like you deem it worthy. We believe you will see that merit in this wonderplant. Please visit Abambooproject  for much more information and if you have ANY questions please contact me.
The Perks:
This was a perplexing problem. What to offer, then it hit us.. What better way to show you the benefits of bamboo and a local economy than offering Bamboo products from local resources!?!
 
ALL PERK PACKAGES INCLUDE:  A thank you and your name on the bamboo Library wall. Your name included in the Bamboo Industry for the U.S. Registry. This registry will be utilized in many petition and campaign pushes for tax incentives, and subsidies to further provide incentives for farmers and offset the initial losses during first planting to harvest.

 Right to left: Do The BOO T-shirt/Sweatshirt, Bamboozing wine accessory kit, Boo Book Bamboo Notebook, Bamboo IPad case, Foudner Package entrance wall. 
L. Bamboo iZen bluetooth bamboo keyboard, R. Imagine Bamboo pendant
We look forward to hearing from you. With every share, every dollar, every like or tweet you are helping us get the bamboo industry off the ground in the United States, and making a big difference on the environment. As our research continues, and already existing products are a lower cost, the popularity of Bamboo will continue to grow, and the demand will be met by local growers, made in U.S. factories, and help America toward a greener future.

continuing for ages, yet after the Fukushima disaster that resulted in the

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Every day voyage of this fisherman – the waking up, the

<h3>Yes, but why? A brief motivation<br/>
</h3>On the 11th of March 2011 I had this deafening silence in my head, just after I read what happened in Japan. I have a musician friend there, him and his wife were showing no signs of life for ten days. Afterwards they informed me that they are safe in a faraway island. <br/>In those ten days a song started in my head, I recorded it and we mixed it together with that friend of mine (here's a link to it: <a href=""http://snd.sc/viENu1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://snd.sc/viENu1</a> ). It was one of the three moments in my life that I got to realize we've got no time to lose. <br/><br/>Until August I tried to follow the events to know if they are to clean the environment and to somehow take care of peoples’ lives. There was little information from the governmental sources in Japan, and the little that seemed objective was minuscule particles of information from independent researchers. I remember an article that said that one of the measures taken by the government to “tackle” the problem was to raise the allowed amount of the radioactive particles for children. Not bad for “tackling” I suppose. <br/><br/>In the end everything comes down to simple mathematics: radioactive particles are descending into the soil and with the rain and underground waters go straight into the ocean, where they remaining on the algae, that are being eaten by small fish, that are being eaten by bigger fish, that are being eaten by the biggest ones, till the end of the line where there is every one of us. We are water.<br/><br/>I know there is a lot going on to clean the surface if the Island as well as to clean the water and to make the environment livable. Yet somehow in all these months there was too much silence from the official sources about what's going on and how things are being resolved. <br/><br/>I know that I have to try and move this issue - and I want to make it a documentary, a universal language of moving pictures. <br/><h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact I'd hope for would be the global awareness. The tragedy happened, but it is already so far from everything we do in our daily life. One checks over the daily news - it does not exist anymore. So I thought, in-between all those report-like and research-style documentaries, a poetic documentary on the tragedy could have its place. <br/></p>
<p>With the help of all you, hopefully, the documentary will travel the globe. It will sure end up on the screen, be presented on the DVD and will be screened at schools all over, I'll make sure to to make it happen with a little help of those who find it a right cause.<br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>I've summed up that a 15000 USD support would be enough to get it going and done. The main part of the costs - I believe more than a half - will be the travel.

The DVDs of the film will be available to others and everyone will have his or hers name in the ""thank you"" line on the facebook page of the project as well as in the end titles of the film.<br/>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>If everyone would share a word or two about the project with all the folks they know, together, we would make it to raise enough funds and to spread the word. Use Twitter, Facebook, word-of-mouth at the dinner table, anything does.<br/>It would be great if there would be someone out there that would care to organize the screening events (on the completion of the DVD) in their school, town, community house etc. That would make it have a tour around the globe and perhaps make some real impact. <br/>If by any chance there would be someone from Japan that would like to participate in the project while being there as a translator, a supporter, a guide, please do not hesitate to get in touch, your participation will be highly appreciated!! <br/><br/>

Other Ways You Can HelpIf everyone would share a word or two about the project with all the folks they know, together, we would make it to raise enough funds and to spread the word. Use Twitter, Facebook, word-of-mouth at the dinner table, anything does.It would be great if there would be someone out there that would care to organize the screening events (on the completion of the DVD) in their school, town, community house etc. That would make it have a tour around the globe and perhaps make some real impact. If by any chance there would be someone from Japan that would like to participate in the project while being there as a translator, a supporter, a guide, please do not hesitate to get in touch, your participation will be highly appreciated!!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Cal-Earth Institute is a 501 (c)(3) nonprofit organization founded in 1991. After the passing of founding architect and humanitarian Nader Khalili (1936-2008), his son and daughter along with a team of his former apprentices gathered together to continue his quest to provide sustainable solutions to human shelter through research, development, and education in earth architecture.  






In the years since Nader Khalili's passing, Cal-Earth has grown immensely. We currently reach over 1.5 million through worldwide outreach and social media, in addition to more than 1,500 visitors who come to the site annually for workshops and tours. 




Structures have been built in over 40 countries, Cal-Earth workshops have been held on 5 continents, and Cal-Earth Spain was officially established in 2009. 


Your donation to the Vision Campaign will go towards two main projects: An online education program, and additional scholarships for low-income students.








This is a grassroots organization,  built entirely by students and volunteers. We need your help to ensure that Nader Khalili's work and Cal-Earth's legacy of sustainability will not only endure but also thrive and expand.  






If it is not accessible, it is not sustainable.  We are committed to teaching anyone who is interested in learning, regardless of their financial position. The more we are able to raise, the more scholarships we can provide for deserving students. 






Housing should not be out of reach. Through our combined efforts at Cal-Earth, we hope to achieve Nader Khalili's ultimate vision: a world in which every person is empowered to build a safe and sustainable home with their own hands, using the earth under their feet. 





Please help us advance Cal-Earth's legacy of sustainability. We hope we can count on your help as we continue to reduce environmental impact and reach more of those in need of shelter.

<h3>What is needed &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need an additional $1100 to make Portugal a successful trip! I'll be in Lisbon, Portugal for 9 days so some things are going to add up! </p>
<p>The flight and some other items for the trip has already been covered. Why? Because I won it! I won a scholarship to cover some costs of the trip. Before I tell you what I need your help with, let me first share what I have done to cover parts of the trip thus far. </p>
<ul>
<li>As mentioned above, I secured $1770 in scholarship funds to pay for the flight.</li>
<li>I'm not above ""strapping up my boots"" either. From speaking with my network, I have secured housing for the period of time I will spend in Portugal in order to save more than $700 to stay in a hotel.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now I need <strong><em>your help</em></strong> to cover things like transportation, food,  etc. </p>
<ul>
<li>$50 per day for travel.</li>
<li>$50 per day for food.</li>
<li>Miscellanious fees like registration for the conferences ($100) </li>
</ul>
<p>Perks: </p>
<p>Look to your right! There are some pretty awesome ones. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the goal is not reached, any available funds will go towards my attendance and participation of the conference. If there are funds over the goal amount, the funds will go to the Rotaract Kansas City group so they can make an impact in the Kansas City, Missouri area.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Other than clean air and food, each and every one of us needs water to survive. It can't help if it's too contaminated to consume. Attending these conferences will help grow my knowledge about the water we all need and how I can ultimately get more involved to create more change in the future. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Can't donate? I understand. We all can contribute in multiple ways! </p>
<p>Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about your campaign.</p>

As mentioned above, I secured $1770 in scholarship funds to pay for the flight.
I'm not above ""strapping up my boots"" either. From speaking with my network, I have secured housing for the period of time I will spend in Portugal in order to save more than $700 to stay in a hotel.

Now I need your help to cover things like transportation, food,  etc. 

$50 per day for travel.
$50 per day for food.
Miscellanious fees like registration for the conferences ($100) 

Perks: 
Look to your right! There are some pretty awesome ones. 
 
If the goal is not reached, any available funds will go towards my attendance and participation of the conference. If there are funds over the goal amount, the funds will go to the Rotaract Kansas City group so they can make an impact in the Kansas City, Missouri area.


The Impact
Other than clean air and food, each and every one of us needs water to survive. It can't help if it's too contaminated to consume. Attending these conferences will help grow my knowledge about the water we all need and how I can ultimately get more involved to create more change in the future.

<h3> My name is Christine Tessman and I am a life-long Berlin/ Kensington resident and a mother of 4 children.  I am on the Advisory Board for the Hungerford Park. My oldest is 28 and my youngest is 9 and my grandson is 4.  My children have enjoyed the Hungerford Park a decade now and my youngest (Allie-9) has gone to Mr. Nick's Summer Science program 3 years in a row and her fondest memories are of the Huckleberry Finn Style of rafting around the Pond at Hungerford Park and collecting and studying wildlife and of course returning it to the pond. Frogs, turtles, fish and insects are so interesting to children as they are learning about nature. The reason I've started this campaign is that <strong>the Pond at the Hungerford Park in Kensington Is Dying.</strong>.. It has been increasingly over-run by a very dangerous algae that has taken over the pond completely this year and is killing all the wildlife.</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The algae layer on the top is at least a foot thick and the Huckleberry Finn ride is over.... and not only does it sadden me and my children, but it has become an unsightly eyesore to neighbors and passers-by. Everyone says, ""well the winter months will kill the algae"".. but, not true.. what happens is that when the pond ices over, the algae uses up all the oxygen left in the water in order to survive and then drops to the bottom. This kills the ponf life and in the spring, we have what is called a FISH KILL, and all the dead animals, frogs, fish, turtles etc, all float to the top creating a terrible environment in the spring that then needs to be dealt with as well. </h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Clearing up the algae could cost up to $9000 over the course of the next few years and then to maintain its clarity for continued use by the children in our Youth Programs each and every summer.. It is the highlight for most of the children to go out on the pond and explore. </h3>

Not only do these practices harm our environment, but they endanger our health and the health of those around us. I've always been passionate about the importance of sustainable practices and buying organic and local food, but now I want to take it a step further: with your help, I'm traveling to Israel in order to learn (and work!) firsthand for a month on a family run eco-farm in Nir Moshe, a small community in the northwestern part of the Negev Desert in Israel. What do you get out of this? As a result of what I learn, I will be publishing photos and a set of articles educating others on how they can make a difference via The Times of Israel (where I already blog) , and plan on developing a business model to bring back to the United States. Here's How We Do It.  I attend college in New York City. In order to get to Israel and make this all happen, I'll need a plane ticket and money to pay the ecofarm for training, food and lodging. The funds break down as follows:1 month stay on the ecofarm: $1,000Flight to Israel: $1,500The ImpactEducated Entrepreneurs are our only hope of building a system of sustainable agriculture. With your help, I'll have the tools I need to educate others as well as hopefully start a business model of my own. Spread the word. Any amount makes a difference. Tell your friends, family, neighbors. Even if this project isn't fully funded, I plan on making it happen; that's how important this is to me.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong><em>Why the campaign?</em></strong></h3>
<p>If you are fascinated by the incredible diversity of life on this planet and you wish to see it survive the millennium… If you wish to inspire the next generation to protect it… And if you believe that conserving tropical biodiversity in poor countries can and should benefit local communities then read on.</p>
<p>The Maya Mountain Marine Corridor (MMMC) in southern Belize is one of the world’s most unspoiled biodiversity havens. The 3240 km<sup>2</sup> landscape/seascape stretches from the pristine old-growth rainforest of the Maya Mountains out to the coral reefs of the Snake Cayes. Each and every ecosystem is still intact, 75% of the MMMC is legally protected and over 90% of its land area is still forested. The landscape supports 49 globally threatened or endangered species including Baird's tapir, jaguar, West Indian manatee and four species of sea turtle.</p>
<p>Historically, the MMMC was inaccessible and had a very low human population density. However, now it has one of the highest population growth rates in Central America and 60% of the population has insufficient income to meet basic requirements for food, clothing and shelter. People want economic development and, not knowing any different, it is easy for them to take for granted the healthy forests, rivers and reefs all around them.</p>
<p>The direction we go from here will very much depend upon the formation of our current generation of children and youths. It is critical that they come to understand the value and importance of the biological treasures of the MMMC and develop the skills and knowledge they will need to develop sustainable economic uses of these resources.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong><em>Inspiring the youth of the Maya Mountain Marine Corridor to be environmental stewards</em></strong></h3>
<p>Under this project, the Toledo Institute for Development and Environment (TIDE) will provide opportunities for 700 children and adolescents in, and around, the MMMC to develop understanding and appreciation of their amazing natural heritage while engaging in healthy, outdoor activities that empower them to realize their potential.</p>
<p>Three of our main programs in environmental education and outreach are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Freshwater Cup: </strong>a football competition with a twist - to participate, each team must successfully complete a socially and environmentally beneficial project in their community. Previous environmental projects have included planting trees to protect riverbanks, painting murals with environmental messages and starting recycling programs. The program fosters teamwork and empowers kids by making them realize what can be accomplished when we work together.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Summer Camp: </strong>gives primary school children an opportunity to participate in educational outdoor activities during the summer holidays. Children learn to swim, develop teamwork and creative skills and learn about their local environment while having fun. Each one- to two-week camp ends with a field trip to a local national park, fostering a love of nature and building environmental awareness. These trips are extremely successful at engaging children in learning about ecosystems and fostering a love of biodiversity.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Youth Conservation Competition:</strong> final-year high school students compete for partial university scholarships by writing and performing theatrical presentations to raise awareness of and pride in Belize’s natural heritage. The event not only raises environmental awareness but also empowers young people to explore their capabilities by performing in public.

<h3><strong><em>Benefits to children and the environment</em></strong></h3>
<p>Over the last ten years, TIDE has directly engaged over 4,000 children with their local environment. The impacts are already clearly visible in school grounds, which used to be littered with garbage but are now so much cleaner. Teachers report hearing kids telling others not to drop litter and to look after the environment. The impacts should grow as these children, the future farmers, fishermen and decision-makers of the MMMC, carry improved environment consciousness into their adult lives.</p>
<p>Besides greater environmental stewardship, our programs have brought benefits in multiple areas, including: i) gender equality; ii) healthy lifestyles; iii) school performance; and iv) promoting friendship between children of different ethnic groups. Recognizing these benefits to children, UNICEF has helped to support the education and outreach program for the past three years.</p>

If you are fascinated by the incredible diversity of life on this planet and you wish to see it survive the millennium… If you wish to inspire the next generation to protect it… And if you believe that conserving tropical biodiversity in poor countries can and should benefit local communities then read on.
The Maya Mountain Marine Corridor (MMMC) in southern Belize is one of the world’s most unspoiled biodiversity havens. The 3240 km2 landscape/seascape stretches from the pristine old-growth rainforest of the Maya Mountains out to the coral reefs of the Snake Cayes. Each and every ecosystem is still intact, 75% of the MMMC is legally protected and over 90% of its land area is still forested. The landscape supports 49 globally threatened or endangered species including Baird's tapir, jaguar, West Indian manatee and four species of sea turtle.
Historically, the MMMC was inaccessible and had a very low human population density. However, now it has one of the highest population growth rates in Central America and 60% of the population has insufficient income to meet basic requirements for food, clothing and shelter. People want economic development and, not knowing any different, it is easy for them to take for granted the healthy forests, rivers and reefs all around them.
The direction we go from here will very much depend upon the formation of our current generation of children and youths. It is critical that they come to understand the value and importance of the biological treasures of the MMMC and develop the skills and knowledge they will need to develop sustainable economic uses of these resources.
 
Inspiring the youth of the Maya Mountain Marine Corridor to be environmental stewards
Under this project, the Toledo Institute for Development and Environment (TIDE) will provide opportunities for 700 children and adolescents in, and around, the MMMC to develop understanding and appreciation of their amazing natural heritage while engaging in healthy, outdoor activities that empower them to realize their potential.
Three of our main programs in environmental education and outreach are:


Freshwater Cup: a football competition with a twist - to participate, each team must successfully complete a socially and environmentally beneficial project in their community. Previous environmental projects have included planting trees to protect riverbanks, painting murals with environmental messages and starting recycling programs. The program fosters teamwork and empowers kids by making them realize what can be accomplished when we work together.



Summer Camp: gives primary school children an opportunity to participate in educational outdoor activities during the summer holidays. Children learn to swim, develop teamwork and creative skills and learn about their local environment while having fun. Each one- to two-week camp ends with a field trip to a local national park, fostering a love of nature and building environmental awareness. These trips are extremely successful at engaging children in learning about ecosystems and fostering a love of biodiversity.



Youth Conservation Competition: final-year high school students compete for partial university scholarships by writing and performing theatrical presentations to raise awareness of and pride in Belize’s natural heritage. The event not only raises environmental awareness but also empowers young people to explore their capabilities by performing in public. Associate degree scholarships are an attractive incentive for young Belizeans, for many of whom the cost of tuition is a barrier to education. This ensures a high calibre of participation in the competition and helps young people to realize their dreams of higher education.

<b>THIS IS OUR LAST CHANCE TO SAVE OUR FURBABIES</b><br/><br/><p>On November 17, 2011, we believe out of retaliation, we were raided.  All our animals were illegally seized.  However, that is not the worse part of this.  In order to get charges against me (and my husband) the animal control officer (we believe) tried to kill our cats.  However, he did succeed in doing so by withholding their medication and yes we do have proof of that.</p>
<p>I filed a lawsuit against the animal control officer on 11/30/2011 for the return of my animals, we are still in that lawsuit.   The money we are raising is to pay the past due balance of $3000.  So far the fees  have totaled out over $8000 just on the animals attorney only, this does not include the money we've paid on attorneys for the criminal matter, the money we had to pay to have one of our dogs seen by our vet in May 2012, nor the money for ink, photos, etc to prove our innocence.  This case has cost us financially, mentally and emotionally.</p>
<p><b>Why We Feel We Were Retaliated Against By This ACO</b></p>
<p><b> </b>December 15 2009, CPS visited our house.  This was after the town marshal that lives up the street from us (and he is not the town marshal of my town) got into an argument with me over my horses and he told me he was going to call CPS on me.  Apparently he did.  The caseworker shows up, we went to the office to speak to her, cleared everything up.  She asked my husband and me if we'd agree to her opening a case on us, we said no, she offered to get us funding to finish remodeling our kitchen, we still said no.  On December 21, 2009 she unsubstantiated the allegations against us.</p>
<p>January 6, 2010 (and remember, this is AFTER she unsubstantiated the allegations) she sent that same neighbor (the Town Marshal of the neighboring town) to our house to do a welfare child check due to a couple inches of snow expecting to come through.  He and I get into it again.  He wanted to come into my home, I told him no warrant, no entry.  He had been harassing us for over a year and I just got tired of it.  <br/></p>
<p>January 6, 7, 8, 2010 I spoke with the case worker and each of these days she asked me again if I'd agree to her opening a case on  us, again I said no.</p>
<p>January 11, 2010 she came to the house and I only let her in because I was sick and tired of the harassment and I wanted to set the record straight.  She started off saying the school called her and I told her I knew better than that as I had an open relationship with the school and I just spoke with the principle about my kids the month before and he assured me both kids were doing fine.  Anyway, she started in  on me saying this cat had feline leukemia, this cat was ill, that cat had that this or that.  I was like, whoa, I am a former vet tech, I know what I am doing and the cats were under a vets care.  Then she started in on me about homeschooling Parker.  I had to set her straight about that as she did not know any of the legalities of homeschooling in Indiana.  Feeling we got everything laid out and explained she then again asked me if we'd agree to her opening a case on us and again we said no.  She said she could get us funding for new flooring, kitchen cabinets, etc.  we still said no.  She then left.</p>
<p>January 13, 2010, she, her boss, and 2 deputies arrive and tell me they were there to detain my children to a motel at my expense, not into foster care and that she called animal control.  Animal control arrived, stood in my living room for 20 minutes commending me on a job well done.  We went over a few things.  As he went to leave he looked over at the caseworker as if to say goodbye and said he would be back the next day to seize the cats, but I could keep the dog and the chicken (both were house pets, the chicken was not full grown nor fully feathered).  When I asked why he was going to seize the cats he said to help me with my CPS case.  I told him I wanted to speak to my vet before he took any animal from my home and he said I had to do it before he come back the next day.  I did call my vet but she didn't get back with me until January 15, 2010.<br/></p>
<p>January 14, 2010 animal control came back out to seize the cats. <br/></p>
<p>June 2010.  In February 2010, this caseworker who fabricated a cat hoarding story was taken off the case and a new one was assigned (this is how all cases play out).  When Tawana took over I told her repeatidly the lies that Shannon had said and that the cats were cared for.  She even got the educational neglect dropped from the case as well because I too had to educate her and she realized I was right.  She told me if we could prove we were not cat hoarders by providing to her vet bills they'd dismiss the case.  I gave her the receipts I could find which totaled over $1500 for an 18 month period.  She got the case dismissed.  At this point we began waiting for the bench warrant to see the judge over the cats.  That never happened.</p>
<p>After digging and doing research I filed a tort claim on February 28, 2011 against the ACO, the animal control, commissioners and the county council.  The commissioners had 90 days to accept, deny or ignore the claim.  If they denied or ignored it, it meant I then could bring forth the suit in court.</p>
<p>This is when we started noticing odd things beginning to happen..</p>
<p>Sept 24,2011 I was asked to take cats from another kill shelter,  however I was not int he position to do so, so I didn't.</p>
<p>Oct 28, 2011 my horses were stolen by the same deputy that was part of the 2010 cps case.  I was told he was going to file abuse charges with the prosecutor.  Prosecutor just said for me to make my paddock bigger.  Which is was already too big and was not any bigger for specific reasons.<br/></p>
<p>November 15, 2011 I was asked by another No Kill to help a woman in Louisville, KY who was going to get evicted over her cats if they were not removed.  I told her I wasn't in a situation to help, but I thought about it, what would I want someone to do if it were me.  I helped to prevent her from being evicted and to move the cats as her neighbor was shooting them with a bb gun.  Helping her is what got me raided. <br/></p>
<p>There are TOO many ""coincidences"" for it not to be all tied in.  There is a pattern here also that I cannot say yet either.  <br/></p>
<p><b>The Defamation, The Rumors</b></p>
<p>Our children are now 20, 19 and 16 years old (Josh, Candace and Parker).  They  have literally lost 3 1/2 years of their lives because of animal control and CPS.  And it's not fair.  Parker has lost not just his cats from 2010 but Sagwa, Garfield, Izzie and Zim in 2011 and 2012.  We have many supporters only because they  have chosen to listen to our side.  Our side has never been sugar coated, we have never lied, we have been honest and upfront with each and every person that has asked what our side was.  We have nothing to hide.<br/><br/>The media was brought into this not to tell about a ""hoarder posing as a rescue"" as the ACO said about me but to defame me to get everyone to turn against me. I am not a hoarder, nor did I pose as a rescue, I do own a rescue, I do believe in no kill, I do believe in helping whenever I can.  This ACO  boasted in June 2013 how our county has a 70% kill rate and then in September that it went up to 94% and the commissioners have said his ""Operation Dog Gone"" is a success.  Well I don't think 94% killing rate is a success when just months before it was lower.<br/></p>
<p>At no point have I ever been a hoarder, at no point have I ever harmed an animal and at no point have my children ever been put in harms way.  However, at the time of the raid we were dealing with a flooded basement.  In which we had forced Josh (our oldest child)  out of his bedroom (which was in the basement) due to the flooding issue.  We had been moving items out of the basement to fix it come tax time in 2012.  We had been purging attics to fit items we didn't normally use and getting rid of items we no longer needed trying to make space for Josh to have a some sort of  bedroom in the living room, in which to do so we had to do away with much of our living room furniture.  We had no where else for him to go, but he was not going to remain in the basement at that point.  What people are not understanding is that Josh was legally an adult and I still FORCED him out of that room for safety reasons.  But yet I am being  bad mouthed by people claiming that because they saw in the media that I FORCED Candace or Parker to sleep in the basement therefore it is true and that is a big bold faced lie and the ones that said it know it and I can prove they knew it by the statement and comments that the ACO and the deputy said about Candace and Parker's bedrooms.  And why would I force my 2 younger children to sleep in a bedroom or basement that I forced their adult brother out of, especially when they had their own bedrooms on the main floor?  So to keep my house clean was I supposed to make Josh live in the basement, just throw everything in the basement in the garbage?  Or was I supposed to do what any parent, home owner would do, move my son out of the basement and try to salvage what we could?<br/></p>
<p>Another issue in the media is the so called ""floors covered in feces"" and ""we have pictures of feces on the beds.."" that also is not true.   I can also explain that.  The night before the raid I went to bed at 11 pm (not to sleep,just laid down for the night waiting for my husband to call me) this was after I checked the main floor litter boxes.  The litter boxes were ok for the night.  Imagine for a moment, 27 cats in your home, in a 1500 sq foot open floor plan home (this is just the main floor and upstairs, not the full size basement).  There was plenty of room for 27 cats, but you have to stay on top of the litter boxes, everyone knows that, and it's not hard to do.  Figure up the hours.  11 pm to 5:30 pm not one litter box touched on the main floor.  Not because I didn't want to, but because I got up around 10 am or so the day of the raid, began doing my chores which was cleaning the upstairs litter boxes and by noon found out we were being staked out.  Since we were also fall cleaning to get ready for Christmas decorations I had taken my curtains off the living room window, the deputy and town marshal (yes, same one from 2010) were walking around my yard and porch for a good hour and a half, so any chores needing to be done on the main floor were unable to even begin for that day.  There was no feces as the media reports all over the floors nor on any bed in my home and there are no pictures of feces on my bed or any bed for that matter.  There was feces outside the litter boxes on the main floor because we were staked out and could not tend to our daily chores and that can  happen with just 1 cat.  The floor was dirty from dragging up wet and dirty items from the basement, no it had not been mopped because we were not done,we were actually behind on getting things done because I had to take Josh to the doctor on Nov 14, 2011, had to take a cat to the vet same day and had to take Josh to a  school event on Nov 16, 2011 and I just had not had a chance to mop, and I mopped after we had finished that week of bringing items up and putting them away.  It was either put my child and a few cats first or keep my house nice and tidy.  I chose to put my kids and my cats first of whom had to go to the doctor, my chores would always be there, their health may not.</p>
<p><b>The Charges</b><br/></p>
<p>The arrest charges stem from lack of veterinary care.  However, I am not the person that withheld veterinary care, the ACO is.  I provided animal control with the medication I got from my vet on November 14, 2011 and November 16, 2011.  I directed them who got what and that my vet wanted all the cats on L Lysine, I had ordered it (from that same vet that saw Kenya on 11/14/11) but it had not came in yet.  The ACO withheld all my medication.  The contracted vet ordered medication on 11/18/11 and the ACO withheld that also.  The ACO said that his vet told him to not give them the medication until after the bloodwork came back.  However, that vet said he would not of done that.   The first one that died was 9 days after the raid, she was an 8 week old kitten.  The next 2 were euthanized on day 11 and 12.  The ACO vet said these cats Sagwa and Garfield were euthanzied due to the fact that animal control could not afford to vet them for their illness, an illness that the ACO apparently caused.  Sagwa was watched for 30 minutes having a seizure, in which in stead of providing a trip to the vets office to be put on Valium the ACO (who had the ultimate last say on whether or not an animal lives or dies in his care) said to euthanize her.  Garfield was said to be suffering, lethargic, had a bad URI, had blood tinged pus coming from his mouth.  Instead of providing vet care, he too was just euthanzied.  His illness came from not being medicated for a URI when I told them what my vet wanted my cats to have.  The 4th charge came from an adoption cat.  December 8, 2011, they note on her chart ""no appetite"".  Abbigayle at no point was ever vetted for anorexia or depression from being ripped away from us, she was starved to death for 8 days.  December 14,  2011 they found her dead in the cage. My husband and I got charged for the deaths of these cats.   As you can clearly see, there was no probable cause at all to charge us let alone arrest us.  These cats, 2 of which were my sons beloved pets died at the hands of a monster, someone that chose to use the animals lives against me because I stood my ground against his actions in 2010.  He has no right to use the law against anyone like he did my family.</p>
<p><b>Saving The Animals</b><br/></p>
<p>We are getting ready to go to court to see the judge for our final chance to get our pets home.  Every hearing costs us $1000.  I will fight until I have no fight left, our animals WANT to come home and we want them home more than anyone knows.  But because I have been shunned by most of the rescue community by the rumors and defamation, my donations are very low, I can't have local fundraisers because my ""haters"" get them canceled and the ones they are hurting are my animals and my children.  Fundraisers to raise the money for the animals attorney fund has been canceled which has caused us to really hold back the power we have to see this through because this is such a complex case and our attorney charges a lot per hour and the case in the past few months has really developed against the parties suing us for criminal actions.<br/></p>
<p>June 2012, 7 months in animal controls care, Izzie, Parker's love of his life fell over dead from a seizure (cat # 2 with a seizure in the aco's care).  November 2012 1 year after the raid, Parker's rooster Zim died.  If we do not get these animals home he will kill every one of them out of spite.  He doesn't care about animals and he really does not care about mine.</p>
<p>Please help us raise the $3000 that we owe the animals attorney so he can move forth to prepare for the final hearing.  This case has been going on too long to just stop now.  Our animals deserve the community to fight for them and get them home.</p>
<p>If you do not believe my side, before judging me, please look at the evidence, it proves I am innocent.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Samantha, Randell, Josh, Candace and Parker<br/></p>

I filed a lawsuit against the animal control officer on 11/30/2011 for the return of my animals, we are still in that lawsuit.   The money we are raising is to pay the past due balance of $3000.  So far the fees  have totaled out over $8000 just on the animals attorney only, this does not include the money we've paid on attorneys for the criminal matter, the money we had to pay to have one of our dogs seen by our vet in May 2012, nor the money for ink, photos, etc to prove our innocence.  This case has cost us financially, mentally and emotionally.
Why We Feel We Were Retaliated Against By This ACO
 December 15 2009, CPS visited our house.  This was after the town marshal that lives up the street from us (and he is not the town marshal of my town) got into an argument with me over my horses and he told me he was going to call CPS on me.  Apparently he did.  The caseworker shows up, we went to the office to speak to her, cleared everything up.  She asked my husband and me if we'd agree to her opening a case on us, we said no, she offered to get us funding to finish remodeling our kitchen, we still said no.  On December 21, 2009 she unsubstantiated the allegations against us.
January 6, 2010 (and remember, this is AFTER she unsubstantiated the allegations) she sent that same neighbor (the Town Marshal of the neighboring town) to our house to do a welfare child check due to a couple inches of snow expecting to come through.  He and I get into it again.  He wanted to come into my home, I told him no warrant, no entry.  He had been harassing us for over a year and I just got tired of it.  
January 6, 7, 8, 2010 I spoke with the case worker and each of these days she asked me again if I'd agree to her opening a case on  us, again I said no.
January 11, 2010 she came to the house and I only let her in because I was sick and tired of the harassment and I wanted to set the record straight.  She started off saying the school called her and I told her I knew better than that as I had an open relationship with the school and I just spoke with the principle about my kids the month before and he assured me both kids were doing fine.  Anyway, she started in  on me saying this cat had feline leukemia, this cat was ill, that cat had that this or that.  I was like, whoa, I am a former vet tech, I know what I am doing and the cats were under a vets care.  Then she started in on me about homeschooling Parker.  I had to set her straight about that as she did not know any of the legalities of homeschooling in Indiana.  Feeling we got everything laid out and explained she then again asked me if we'd agree to her opening a case on us and again we said no.  She said she could get us funding for new flooring, kitchen cabinets, etc.  we still said no.  She then left.
January 13, 2010, she, her boss, and 2 deputies arrive and tell me they were there to detain my children to a motel at my expense, not into foster care and that she called animal control.  Animal control arrived, stood in my living room for 20 minutes commending me on a job well done.  We went over a few things.  As he went to leave he looked over at the caseworker as if to say goodbye and said he would be back the next day to seize the cats, but I could keep the dog and the chicken (both were house pets, the chicken was not full grown nor fully feathered).  When I asked why he was going to seize the cats he said to help me with my CPS case.  I told him I wanted to speak to my vet before he took any animal from my home and he said I had to do it before he come back the next day.  I did call my vet but she didn't get back with me until January 15, 2010.
January 14, 2010 animal control came back out to seize the cats. 
June 2010.  In February 2010, this caseworker who fabricated a cat hoarding story was taken off the case and a new one was assigned (this is how all cases play out).  When Tawana took over I told her repeatidly the lies that Shannon had said and that the cats were cared for.  She even got the educational neglect dropped from the case as well because I too had to educate her and she realized I was right.  She told me if we could prove we were not cat hoarders by providing to her vet bills they'd dismiss the case.  I gave her the receipts I could find which totaled over $1500 for an 18 month period.  She got the case dismissed.  At this point we began waiting for the bench warrant to see the judge over the cats.  That never happened.
After digging and doing research I filed a tort claim on February 28, 2011 against the ACO, the animal control, commissioners and the county council.  The commissioners had 90 days to accept, deny or ignore the claim.  If they denied or ignored it, it meant I then could bring forth the suit in court.
This is when we started noticing odd things beginning to happen..
Sept 24,2011 I was asked to take cats from another kill shelter,  however I was not int he position to do so, so I didn't.
Oct 28, 2011 my horses were stolen by the same deputy that was part of the 2010 cps case.  I was told he was going to file abuse charges with the prosecutor.  Prosecutor just said for me to make my paddock bigger.  Which is was already too big and was not any bigger for specific reasons.
November 15, 2011 I was asked by another No Kill to help a woman in Louisville, KY who was going to get evicted over her cats if they were not removed.  I told her I wasn't in a situation to help, but I thought about it, what would I want someone to do if it were me.  I helped to prevent her from being evicted and to move the cats as her neighbor was shooting them with a bb gun.  Helping her is what got me raided. 
There are TOO many ""coincidences"" for it not to be all tied in.  There is a pattern here also that I cannot say yet either.  
The Defamation, The Rumors
Our children are now 20, 19 and 16 years old (Josh, Candace and Parker).  They  have literally lost 3 1/2 years of their lives because of animal control and CPS.  And it's not fair.  Parker has lost not just his cats from 2010 but Sagwa, Garfield, Izzie and Zim in 2011 and 2012.  We have many supporters only because they  have chosen to listen to our side.  Our side has never been sugar coated, we have never lied, we have been honest and upfront with each and every person that has asked what our side was.  We have nothing to hide.The media was brought into this not to tell about a ""hoarder posing as a rescue"" as the ACO said about me but to defame me to get everyone to turn against me. I am not a hoarder, nor did I pose as a rescue, I do own a rescue, I do believe in no kill, I do believe in helping whenever I can.  This ACO  boasted in June 2013 how our county has a 70% kill rate and then in September that it went up to 94% and the commissioners have said his ""Operation Dog Gone"" is a success.  Well I don't think 94% killing rate is a success when just months before it was lower.
At no point have I ever been a hoarder, at no point have I ever harmed an animal and at no point have my children ever been put in harms way.  However, at the time of the raid we were dealing with a flooded basement.  In which we had forced Josh (our oldest child)  out of his bedroom (which was in the basement) due to the flooding issue.  We had been moving items out of the basement to fix it come tax time in 2012.  We had been purging attics to fit items we didn't normally use and getting rid of items we no longer needed trying to make space for Josh to have a some sort of  bedroom in the living room, in which to do so we had to do away with much of our living room furniture.  We had no where else for him to go, but he was not going to remain in the basement at that point.  What people are not understanding is that Josh was legally an adult and I still FORCED him out of that room for safety reasons.  But yet I am being  bad mouthed by people claiming that because they saw in the media that I FORCED Candace or Parker to sleep in the basement therefore it is true and that is a big bold faced lie and the ones that said it know it and I can prove they knew it by the statement and comments that the ACO and the deputy said about Candace and Parker's bedrooms.  And why would I force my 2 younger children to sleep in a bedroom or basement that I forced their adult brother out of, especially when they had their own bedrooms on the main floor?  So to keep my house clean was I supposed to make Josh live in the basement, just throw everything in the basement in the garbage?  Or was I supposed to do what any parent, home owner would do, move my son out of the basement and try to salvage what we could?
Another issue in the media is the so called ""floors covered in feces"" and ""we have pictures of feces on the beds.."" that also is not true.   I can also explain that.  The night before the raid I went to bed at 11 pm (not to sleep,just laid down for the night waiting for my husband to call me) this was after I checked the main floor litter boxes.  The litter boxes were ok for the night.  Imagine for a moment, 27 cats in your home, in a 1500 sq foot open floor plan home (this is just the main floor and upstairs, not the full size basement).  There was plenty of room for 27 cats, but you have to stay on top of the litter boxes, everyone knows that, and it's not hard to do.  Figure up the hours.  11 pm to 5:30 pm not one litter box touched on the main floor.  Not because I didn't want to, but because I got up around 10 am or so the day of the raid, began doing my chores which was cleaning the upstairs litter boxes and by noon found out we were being staked out.  Since we were also fall cleaning to get ready for Christmas decorations I had taken my curtains off the living room window, the deputy and town marshal (yes, same one from 2010) were walking around my yard and porch for a good hour and a half, so any chores needing to be done on the main floor were unable to even begin for that day.  There was no feces as the media reports all over the floors nor on any bed in my home and there are no pictures of feces on my bed or any bed for that matter.  There was feces outside the litter boxes on the main floor because we were staked out and could not tend to our daily chores and that can  happen with just 1 cat.  The floor was dirty from dragging up wet and dirty items from the basement, no it had not been mopped because we were not done,we were actually behind on getting things done because I had to take Josh to the doctor on Nov 14, 2011, had to take a cat to the vet same day and had to take Josh to a  school event on Nov 16, 2011 and I just had not had a chance to mop, and I mopped after we had finished that week of bringing items up and putting them away.  It was either put my child and a few cats first or keep my house nice and tidy.  I chose to put my kids and my cats first of whom had to go to the doctor, my chores would always be there, their health may not.
The Charges
The arrest charges stem from lack of veterinary care.  However, I am not the person that withheld veterinary care, the ACO is.  I provided animal control with the medication I got from my vet on November 14, 2011 and November 16, 2011.  I directed them who got what and that my vet wanted all the cats on L Lysine, I had ordered it (from that same vet that saw Kenya on 11/14/11) but it had not came in yet.  The ACO withheld all my medication.  The contracted vet ordered medication on 11/18/11 and the ACO withheld that also.  The ACO said that his vet told him to not give them the medication until after the bloodwork came back.  However, that vet said he would not of done that.   The first one that died was 9 days after the raid, she was an 8 week old kitten.  The next 2 were euthanized on day 11 and 12.  The ACO vet said these cats Sagwa and Garfield were euthanzied due to the fact that animal control could not afford to vet them for their illness, an illness that the ACO apparently caused.  Sagwa was watched for 30 minutes having a seizure, in which in stead of providing a trip to the vets office to be put on Valium the ACO (who had the ultimate last say on whether or not an animal lives or dies in his care) said to euthanize her.  Garfield was said to be suffering, lethargic, had a bad URI, had blood tinged pus coming from his mouth.  Instead of providing vet care, he too was just euthanzied.  His illness came from not being medicated for a URI when I told them what my vet wanted my cats to have.  The 4th charge came from an adoption cat.  December 8, 2011, they note on her chart ""no appetite"".  Abbigayle at no point was ever vetted for anorexia or depression from being ripped away from us, she was starved to death for 8 days.  December 14,  2011 they found her dead in the cage. My husband and I got charged for the deaths of these cats.   As you can clearly see, there was no probable cause at all to charge us let alone arrest us.  These cats, 2 of which were my sons beloved pets died at the hands of a monster, someone that chose to use the animals lives against me because I stood my ground against his actions in 2010.  He has no right to use the law against anyone like he did my family.
Saving The Animals
We are getting ready to go to court to see the judge for our final chance to get our pets home.  Every hearing costs us $1000.  I will fight until I have no fight left, our animals WANT to come home and we want them home more than anyone knows.  But because I have been shunned by most of the rescue community by the rumors and defamation, my donations are very low, I can't have local fundraisers because my ""haters"" get them canceled and the ones they are hurting are my animals and my children.  Fundraisers to raise the money for the animals attorney fund has been canceled which has caused us to really hold back the power we have to see this through because this is such a complex case and our attorney charges a lot per hour and the case in the past few months has really developed against the parties suing us for criminal actions.
June 2012, 7 months in animal controls care, Izzie, Parker's love of his life fell over dead from a seizure (cat # 2 with a seizure in the aco's care).  November 2012 1 year after the raid, Parker's rooster Zim died.  If we do not get these animals home he will kill every one of them out of spite.  He doesn't care about animals and he really does not care about mine.
Please help us raise the $3000 that we owe the animals attorney so he can move forth to prepare for the final hearing.  This case has been going on too long to just stop now.  Our animals deserve the community to fight for them and get them home.
If you do not believe my side, before judging me, please look at the evidence, it proves I am innocent.

</div></div>","STOP PRESS -- WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY SECURED AN EXTENSION TO OUR DEADLINE IN ORDER TO ENSURE WE MEET OUR TARGET, GIVE PEOPLE MORE TIME TO CONTRIBUTE AND RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO LOOK AT THE VIABILITY OF PROVIDING A SUBTITLING PACKAGE. THE NEW DEADLINE IS MIDNIGHT GMT THURSDAY 11TH JUNE 2015.Emergence - in association with Resurgence Magazine, Schumacher College, Culture Colony and Volcano Theatre - is making a landmark documentary series of 6
hour-long conversations with Satish Kumar, one of
the greatest living teachers and visionaries of the 21st century - and
we want you to help us make it happen.
From April 27th to
May 29th 2015, we are running our first crowdfunding campaign to raise £25,000 to enable us to fully fund and support the team who will be making, editing, producing and distributing these groundbreaking documentaries. Who is Satish Kumar?
Born in 1936, Satish became a Jain Monk at the age of 9 and then, at the age of 18, joined the Gandhian
non-violent land reform movement. In 1964 his 8,000 mile, Peace Walk took him from Delhi to
all the nuclear capitals of the world, without a penny in his pocket, carrying
only a message of peace.

He later settled in the UK and went on to become Editor of Resurgence
Magazine, championing ecology, art and spirituality. He founded the
world’s leading college for activists and change-makers, Schumacher College, now celebrating
its 25th anniversary.  

“Satish is a truly remarkable manifestation of the human spirit.
Working at the juncture of curiosity and compassion, he's inspired so many to
do so much!” Bill
McKibben, founder 350.org






“Visionary, earthy, filled with wonder - Satish Kumar and his work
holds a door of possibility towards a future worth serving.”Martin Shaw, West Country School of Myth.

In his tireless teaching, writing and speaking over eight decades,
Satish has changed countless lives. But never before has there been a record of
his life and work that deeply investigates all that he stands for and advocates.
Why make a documentary
series?
We live in extreme and scary times, yet we lack the political
leadership we need to bring our planet back from the brink of ecological,
social and economic crisis. This situation leaves many of us feeling isolated
and disempowered. The message at the heart of Satish’s teaching is that
individuals can and do change the world for the better. He is a living example
of Gandhi’s maxim that we should “be the change we want to see in the world”.
At times like these, we all need to be inspired to change – and Satish is one
of the most inspirational teachers the world has ever seen.
Satish advocates a holistic, spiritual, nature-based philosophy, placing human beings back into our rightful context as an integral part of natural systems and not their masters - as economic 'realists' would have it...
'Kumar has no time for realists. ""Is my approach unrealistic?"" he asks. ""Look at what realists have done for us. They have led us to war and climate change, poverty on an unimaginable scale, and wholesale ecological destruction. Half of humanity goes to bed hungry because of all the realistic leaders in the world. I tell people who call me 'unrealistic' to show me what their realism has done. Realism is an outdated, overplayed and wholly exaggerated concept.""'John Vidal - Guardian article

Satish's philosophy is radical yet timeless, revolutionary and yet utterly simple:
""We need to embrace all of society. We need to solve social problems of poverty and wars with imagination, compassion, creativity and forgiveness. All problems can be solved by negotiation, friendship, giving in, letting go of ego and going into eco. Let us make a shift from self-interest to mutual-interest of whole human society. If we can have a holistic view of soil, soul and society, if we can understand the interdependence of all living beings, and understand that all living creatures – from trees to worms to humans – depend on each other, then we can live in harmony with ourselves, with other people and with nature."" Satish Kumar - Guardian article
In making this series, we want to bring Satish’s words and teachings
to as wide an audience as possible and, at the same time, create a legacy of
his lifetime of learning for generations to come. This won’t be a hagiography,
a simple glorification of a man’s life and work. We will challenge Satish to
communicate his philosophy as never before through six hours of intense,
enlightening and enriching conversations.
Emergence - who are we?

Emergence is an arts and sustainability collective based in Wales. We make art with one agenda: to change the world. 

Co-created by theatre-maker Fern Smith in 2010 in response to a growing concern that the arts are simply not responding to the environmental and spiritual crisis that human life is causing all across our world, Emergence advocates creative practice for a sustainable future through hosting artful events and gatherings. We commission artworks, host conferences and workshops, create land journeys and pilgrimages, write and publish documents and reports - all addressing the key issue of our time: the art of living well within the ecological limits of a finite planet. 
We work collectively, collaboratively, holistically and, above all, emergently - trusting in synchronicity, the power of natural systems and a values-based approach to ""making art as if the world matters"". 
Satish Kumar is one of the main inspirations behind Emergence and his philosophy and activism continue to inspire everything we do. 
What will the series be
like?

We live in the age of the sound-bite, short attention spans and
‘quick-fix’ culture. We want this series to be the opposite of that – an
opportunity to spend quality time in Satish’s company. The series will present
Satish in deep conversation to really draw out his ideas and stories. We will film the first five interviews in the intimate, relaxed surroundings of Satish's home in Devon. The final interview will be filmed before a live audience at Schumacher College near Totnes, where Satish has been teaching and inspiring for over twenty five years. Backers have the chance to attend this interview, meet Satish and be part of the conversation. 

To ensure rigour of debate, we have chosen as our interviewer Jane Davidson, a teacher and activist, and also
former Minister for the Environment and Sustainability in Wales - the woman
behind the radical One Planet One Wales initiative.



Amongst the many legacies of Jane’s time in post, Wales is now
committed to sustainability as a core organizing principle making it the first government
in the world to take such a stance. Jane is really looking forward to the
conversations with Satish, keen to find ways of drawing out his ideas and bringing
them firmly into the mainstream. Jane and Satish share the same values and
ideals yet approach them from very different viewpoints. These conversations
are sure to be a terrific meeting of minds that will bring real insight into
the huge challenges we all face and offer thoughtful, practical ways to
change things for the better.


Where will the money go?

The target sum of £25,000 is broken down like this:
Production & Direction – 27%, includes developing the
concept, research, building partnerships, logistics and scheduling.
Shooting & Editing – 21%, includes filming, camera and
sound crew, all equipment hire, editing and insurances.

Travel & Accommodation – 13%, for production team and
crew.
Fees & Subsistence – 8%, towards featured contributors.

In the extraordinary event that we exceed our target, we will use the money to pay for a multilingual subtitle package for the documentaries, enabling even more people world-wide to be moved and inspired by Satish's words.

What will you get for your support?
These six hour-long documentaries will be filmed in summer 2015 and released as a limited edition, beautifully presented, DVD box-set in autumn 2016 – Satish’s 80th year and the 50th Anniversary of Resurgence.
By supporting our
campaign and investing in the project, backers will be literally pre-ordering
their copy of the documentaries – either by HD digital download or the DVDs - and we’ve
also put together a terrific package of perks, including signed copies of Satish's latest book, 'Soil, Soul, Society',



There are also places at the Resurgence Summer Gathering, a joyous festival of ideas and inspiration held every year in rural Worcestershire, attended by Satish.

<p>We
need to protect oceans from industrial fishing, drilling and dumping.</p><div>
<p>Hope spots
can make a real difference, as in Cabo Pulmo (Mexico). In the 1980s fish stock
was almost down to zero due to industrial fishing. But in 1997 marine
conservation areas have been created, and now fish biomass in Cabo
Pulmo constitutes the highest recovery of any marine reserve in the
world, and it is a thriving ecoturism spot.</p>

<p>Mission blue was created by Sylvia
Earle, a marine biologist, explorer, author and lecturer. She is a real legend.
She was the leader of the first all-female team of aquanauts in
a project (Tektite II), where the scientists lived under water for weeks at a
time. In 1979, she set the women’s depth record of 381
metres walking untethered on the sea floor. In 1990, she was the
first woman to be appointed as a chief scientist at the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. At present she is explorer-in-residence
at the National Geographic Society. And in 2009 she won a TED prize, with this
talk:</p>

<p>She made
protecting the ocean her life mission, and she really knows what she is talking
about when she says we are facing a paradise lost, as in more than 6000 hours
of diving in her career she saw oceans changing in front of her eyes.</p>

Hello! This is Valentina and this year for
my birthday I don't want gifts, but I'm asking you to help me on a
mission: to create hope spots! 
They
are networks of marine protected areas, which have loads of benefits. Hope
spots:

give
     ocean wildlife a chance to recover
maintain
     healthy biodiversity
support
     habitats that act as carbon sinks
remove
     CO2 from the atmosphere
generate
     the majority of atmospheric oxygen
allow
     low-impact activities like ecotourism to thrive! 

We can do this
together by supporting Mission Blue. 
In 2014 only 3% of the ocean was protected, but we can do
more, and we should act now!
The world’s oceans are in crisis:

50% of coral reefs have died since
     1950


90% of the world’s large
     fish stocks are gone


Up to 40% of fish caught
     today are caught by accident and wasted. Vulnerable sharks, dolphins,
     whales and sea turtles are killed in the process.

Since 1947, 30'000 oil
     drilling sites have been created.

We
need to protect oceans from industrial fishing, drilling and dumping.
Hope spots
can make a real difference, as in Cabo Pulmo (Mexico). In the 1980s fish stock
was almost down to zero due to industrial fishing. But in 1997 marine
conservation areas have been created, and now fish biomass in Cabo
Pulmo constitutes the highest recovery of any marine reserve in the
world, and it is a thriving ecoturism spot.






Mission blue was created by Sylvia
Earle, a marine biologist, explorer, author and lecturer. She is a real legend.
She was the leader of the first all-female team of aquanauts in
a project (Tektite II), where the scientists lived under water for weeks at a
time. In 1979, she set the women’s depth record of 381
metres walking untethered on the sea floor. In 1990, she was the
first woman to be appointed as a chief scientist at the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. At present she is explorer-in-residence
at the National Geographic Society. And in 2009 she won a TED prize, with this
talk:
  

She made
protecting the ocean her life mission, and she really knows what she is talking
about when she says we are facing a paradise lost, as in more than 6000 hours
of diving in her career she saw oceans changing in front of her eyes.
We have
the ability to change things, and now it's the time to change for the better!
Please donate to my campaign and let's help protect the oceans!
Other ways in which you can help the oceans:


eat less fish
avoid endangered fish
eat fish sustainably caught
reduce plastic litter, by reducing use of single-use-plastics, reuse and recycle
inspire others to take action!

<p><i>My chest would tighten while I struggled to breathe.

<p>The Center
for an Ecology-Based
Economy (CEBE) was founded on Earth Day, April 2013 by Shawn Kane, Zizi Vlaun,
Scott Vlaun, and Seal Rossignol, residents of
the Western Maine foothills. We had been brainstorming
for several years about how to best help our
community transition to
greater sustainability and resilience in light of climate
change,
environmental
degradation, economic instability, and resource
depletion. We finally decided to pool our collective
skills in green building, product design,
permaculture, photography, graphic design and curriculum development to collaborate with other like-minded organizations in the Western Maine region.</p>
<p>As CEBE,
we have chosen
to focus on food, shelter, transportation, and
energy as essential, perennial
needs of a community.
This campaign will help fund four inaugural projects
at the hub of our community in Norway, Maine. The projects include: </p>
<p>• <b>SOLAR POWER STATION: </b>Working with
the Alan Day Community Garden to fund and build a solar photovoltaic power station
to pump
irrigation water, light the barn, and run
power tools;</p>
<p>• <b>EDUCATIONAL COMMUNITY KITCHEN: </b>Partnering with
the Fare Share Coop, our local food hub, to help renovate their commercial kitchen to
better support community food events and education; </p>
<p>• <b>MAPLE </b><b>SUGAR HOUSE FOR LOCAL STUDENTS: </b>Facilitating
the design and construction
of a timber-framed sugar house for the Western Foothills Land
Trust at the Roberts Farm Preserve for
local school students to learn about sustainable building practices and the process of
maple sugaring;</p>
<p>• <b>COMMUNITY <b>BIKE RACKS</b></b><b> &amp; <b>BIKE LIBRARY</b>: </b>Collaborating
with Healthy Oxford Hills' Active Community Environments to place
community bike racks on our streets and create a community bike-lending
program.</p><p>These four kick-off projects are valuable because they each focus on using and promoting sustainable local resources, both in materials and skills (solar power, local timber, food from local farms, community infrastructure), and less use of petroleum-based transportation.<br/></p>
<p>Contributing to our campaign will also help keep our doors
open on Main Street for community meeting and organizing. This will allow us to continue
to engage the community and begin mapping needs and
opportunities, and collaborate more effectively with partnering
organizations.</p>
<p>As our community comes together to address these critical issues, CEBE plans to develop a replicable model that other small communities could
use to accomplish initiatives in
the areas of food, shelter, energy and transport, allowing them to
become
more resilient and sustainable as well.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We are working to get the word out about CEBE and
what we have to offer. We have distributed
hundreds of brochures and have presented
our vision and mission to various local
groups. Currently, we are members of a local food collaborative to develop a distribution program for locally-farmed foods, while also assisting in the development and implementation of a
regional student-centered leadership program focused on
food system work. We continue to raise community awareness by hosting workshops, book discussions and public forums and are
researching the creation of a local Time
Bank, Micro-Financing, and hosting a Skills Share events.</span><br/></p>
<p>To promote our long-term goal of a
locally-based, inter-reliant, and sustainable economy, we are
currently in the planning and development stage of creating
a Maker Space for Western Maine—a space where innovators
and entrepreneurs can access the tools and resources they need to develop and
market products utilizing appropriate technologies to address local needs.
</p>
<p>Any amount you can give to help support CEBE
will
be deeply appreciated and take the Western Maine Foothills one step closer to creating an economy based on local and
