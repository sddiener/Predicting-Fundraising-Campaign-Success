<p>Five years ago, I began working with a friend, Oscar, to send 7 students in Ghana to school. In November, I will have a chance to meet them! I am looking for 200 friends old and new to donate $25 to help send these seven children to school for the next year. </p>
<p><strong>My Story.<br/></strong></p> <p>Five years ago, I embarked on a study abroad trip to Ghana. I had long dreamed of traveling to Africa, and I was ready to put my heart and soul into my trip. I spent five months doing everything I could to experience the culture. I lived with a large family (up to 14 of us in the house on any given night!). I studied Ghanaian literature, language and traditional dance at the University of Legon. I interned with a community development organization on the quality of water in Accra. I fell in love with spicy food. I traveled all over the country. So it may come as no surprise that when my friend Oscar told me about the challenges that children in his community face to access education, and asked me to help him support seven children, I had no choice but to say, ""Yes!"". <br/></p>

<h4>
<b>The Who.</b><br/>
</h4>
<p>For three years, these seven students have been in school. Oscar and I have been working together, with the support of many people along the way, to send those absolutely adorable faces pictured above to Wisdom Children's International School in Klikor, Ghana. Seyram, Ramatu, Eyi, Wisdom (top row), Jeff, Elikplim and Etsa (bottom row) each have a unique story. But their stories share a few common themes: they were given no opportunity to stay in school because their family didn't have enough money; they have a love and passion for learning; and each has the desire to make sure that no other student faces these same challenges to receive an education.</p>
<p>As I reflect on this five year anniversary of my trip to Ghana, I know that these children have changed my life. Their stories inspire me. To ensure that these students have the opportunity to remain in school, I am asking <b>200 </b>friends and family (that's you!) to donate. Just <b>$25</b> can help keep these students in school for the next year. <br/></p>
<h4>The Why.</h4>
<p>Education is a global right. School in Ghana is free <i>and </i>compulsory through junior high school. But the reality is that most students cannot afford to go to school because of the many costs to attending class. Transportation to get to school, lunch and snacks while at school, the cost of school supplies and materials, uniforms, exam fees, sports fees. The list is extensive. Many families in Ghana cannot afford these costs, and children suffer the consequences. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<h4>The What.<br/>
</h4>$5,000 will cover all seven students' expenses for FOUR terms of school, all of the 2015-2016 school year and the first term of the 2016-2017 school year. All students attend fall, spring and summer terms, which are each 15 or 16 week sessions. Older students may attend additional two week terms in between, as determined by their grade level. While the fees to attend school at Wisdom Children's International School do change by grade level, an estimate of the expenses for one student for the entire school year is:<ol>
<li>Tuition: $110<br/>
</li>
<li>Books and school supplies: $90<br/>
</li>
<li>Fees for exams, sports and miscellaneous: $50<br/>
</li>
<li>Lunch and a snack everyday: $250</li>
</ol>
<p>If you do the math, you'll notice that this does not <i>quite </i>add up to $5,000. Unfortunately, this is not an exact science as the prices at the school do increase from one year to the next, and the exchange rate fluctuates regularly. We have given ourselves a bit of wiggle room to accommodate for these unpredictable costs, as well as to cover the cost of wiring money to Ghana.<br/></p>

<p>That is the <i>vision</i>
for RestoringHistory.US: to help the next generation of Americans study the
course of history and become effective defenders of the political, economic,
and religious principles that led to freedom. </p>The <i>mission</i> of RestoringHistory.US is to link            educational resources to chapters in popular history textbooks, helping families            to easily locate materials that: <ol>
<li>counteract the liberal/progressive bias found in many
textbooks, and </li>
<li>make the study of history... <b>NOT</b> boring!</li>
</ol><br/><br/><h3>Phase 1: The birth of
RestoringHistory.US</h3>
<p>My name is Steve Johnston. I’m a <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenleejohnston"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">freelance software developer</a> with 18 years of experience, and I also help
homeschool my kids. I found myself
spending a lot of my time searching for the best books, movies, articles, and
other resources to make history ""come alive"" for my kids.  </p>
<p>I thought this project would be a great way to bring together my
skills and interests in a way that could help other families learn more about
the history and founding principles of America.</p>
<p>I completed phase one of the <a href=""http://www.restoringhistory.us"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">RestoringHistory.US website</a> in my spare time and launched it
in August 2013.  You can take a look at
the <a href=""http://www.restoringhistory.us/how-to-use"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">How to Use</a> page for an overview of the site's current functionality.  The following screenshot is an example, showing <i>New Deal or Raw Deal?</i> as a resource that is associated with chapter 26 of the textbook <i>The Story of the World, Vol. 4</i>. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/871057/files/20140920181526-how-to-step3a_20140920_with_border.png?1411262126"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><br/><br/><h3>Phase 2: Critical
improvements to make the website useful</h3><h3>
</h3><p>Since I launched the website last year, I have spent the majority of my available time promoting it on social networks, and writing blog articles on current events, to drive traffic to the site.  Recently, I have refocused my efforts on my core mission, and I have begun adding more resources to the website.  (The <a href=""http://www.restoringhistory.us/updates"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Updates</a> page is a convenient way to see what resources have been added since your last visit to the website.)<br/></p><p>In addition to adding more resources to the RestoringHistory.US website, here are the main features I want to add, to take the website to the next level and make it really useful.</p><ol>
<li>
<b>Support FREE content  </b>Currently, amazon products are the only
types of resources that I can add, but I want to allow linking other types of
FREE online content such as articles and YouTube videos.</li>
<li>
<b><span><span></span></span></b><b>Rate/review and filtering/sorting functionality  </b>Giving users the ability to rate resources will allow the best quality resources
to bubble to the top and make them easier to find.</li>
<li>
<b><span><span></span></span></b><b>Support for multiple textbooks  </b>Currently, <i>The Story of the World </i>is the only textbook that is indexed.  I want to add other homeschool and public school textbooks and link resources to those as well.
</li>
<li>
<b>Crowdsourcing functionality </b> In order for the website to grow exponentially, I need to
allow other people to add resources to the database.  I’ve already had people volunteering to help,
so I need to add the ability for these people to contribute to the site.</li>
</ol><p>In the future, I want students to be able to go to the page associated with a chapter in their textbook and see <i>many</i> resources, including books, movies, articles, online videos, activities, field trip ideas, etc.  Users should have options for sorting and filtering to find the best resources of each type that will meet their needs.</p><br/><br/><h3>Why I need your help</h3>
<p>I have already invested many, <i>many</i> hours in the development and promotion of the site up to this
point, with only a few donations.  However, the growth of the website is severely limited by the fact that I cannot afford to spend more time working on it. 
My goal is to raise $20,000, so that I will be able to set
aside some of my freelance projects and spend more time working to complete the critical
features listed above by April 2015.</p>
<p>If I exceed my funding goals, I have a long list of additional
features that I would like to add, including: </p>
<ul>
<li>Personal organizational tools, to allow users to maintain
their own private lists and notes</li>
<li>A forum to allow for user discussions</li>
<li>Search functionality allowing users to find resources by
topic, time period, author, etc.</li>
</ul><p>
On the other hand, if I am not able to meet my goal of
$20,000, I will use whatever money I raise to add as many resources and features as I am able
to.  Even if phase two is not fully
funded, I would eventually like to complete all of the critical features; however,
doing the work in my “spare time” (haha!) would require the work to be spread
out over a much longer period.
</p>
<br/><br/><h3>Perks — What do you get in return?</h3>
<p>
Most of the potential donors to this campaign are probably families that intend to use the website themselves and/or people who just love America and its founding principles.  I believe that you probably care more about the impact of your donation more than any ""stuff"" (T-shirts, mugs, etc.) that you could get in return.  With this in mind, I wanted to come up with perks that would help maximize the reach of this campaign, and provide some value to businesses or organizations that would like to make larger donations.
</p>
<p>I'm offering 3 sponsorship levels: <b>Minuteman</b> for a donation of <i>any</i> size, and, for larger donations, <b>Lexington</b> and <b>Yorktown</b> sponsorships allow you to advertise your business/organization on the RestoringHistory.US website.
</p>
<br/><h4>Minuteman Sponsorships</h4>
<p>
I have developed a webpage that will allow you to create a
custom graphic with your personal profile image and name, OR your business/organization logo and name.  You will be given access to this web page to create your graphic and share it on social networks.
</p>
<p>Sharing this graphic will serve a dual purpose: to publicly recognize your contribution, and to help spread the word about the campaign further. See the ""Johnny Doe"" graphic below for an example.</p>
<p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/828833/files/20140902091638-IAmRestoringHistory-example.jpg?1409674598"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><h4>Lexington &amp; Yorktown Sponsorships</h4>
<p>For larger donations, I can offer your organization/business
a listing on the <a href=""http://www.restoringhistory.us/sponsors"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sponsors</a> page on RestoringHistory.US.  Yorktown Sponsors ($1,000+ donations) will have their logos
displayed at the top of the sponsors page, with Lexington Sponsors ($250-$999 donations) underneath
them.  </p>
<p>In addition, a smaller logo (max. 55x55 pixels) will be placed in the site
header that will be displayed in all pages of the website.  Yorktown Sponsors will receive guaranteed
placement of their logo in this sponsors section on every page view.  Logos for Lexington Sponsors
will be displayed in this section on a rotational basis, with a minimum of one
Lexington Sponsor displayed on every page view.</p>
<p>
Both the large logos and small header logos will be linked to your URL. These will be displayed through July 4, 2016.
</p>
<p>
The screenshot below shows the Yorktown Sponsors section and the Lexington Sponsors section, as well as the section for smaller logos in the top-left of the page. The Twitter feed on the right will appear while the Indiegogo campaign is active. After that, it will be removed — hopefully, to make more room for sponsor logos!
</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/829229/files/20140902115339-SponsorsPageScreenshot.png?1409684019"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
Since launching the site, I've focused on creating a blog
and building a social media presence on Twitter, Facebook, and Google+.  This effort has gone well, and I’ve connected
with lots of people and brought increasingly more traffic to the site, as shown
in the graph below.  This should give you a rough idea of the number of impressions your logos might receive in the sponsors section in the page header.
</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/829354/files/20140902125234-Pageviews-Sept2013-July2014.PNG?1409687554"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
I anticipate that this upward trend
will continue, if funding allows me to resume blogging and staying active on social media. I don't know if growth will continue to be exponential like it was in June/July, but I do expect many visitors to return multiple times, after these new features
are added, and more resources are listed.
</p>
<br/><br/><h3>What if you can’t afford to donate to the campaign?</h3>
<p>Even if you cannot contribute financially, you can spread
the word about the campaign.  Use the share
buttons at the top of this page to share it on Facebook, Twitter, or
Google+.  Email it to your friends or
link to it on your webpage.  Any way that
you can help will be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>I am hoping that this campaign will be successful, allowing
me to add new functionality which is critical to its future success.  Please consider joining with me to make the
vision of RestoringHistory.US a reality, helping raise a generation of young
Americans who will lead us back to the principles of freedom.</p>

file for 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status.  I did not want to do this before
 running the Indiegogo campaign because I do not have time or money to 
deal with lawyers, accountants, and mounds of paperwork right now.  I also didn't want to risk going through the process only to be delayed or 
denied by the Obama-controlled IRS, as many other conservative groups 
have.  For now, my top priority is to get the majority of this new 
functionality up and running ASAP, to start making RestoringHistory.US useful for 
students and their families.</p>

Rate/review and filtering/sorting functionality  Giving users the ability to rate resources will allow the best quality resources
to bubble to the top and make them easier to find.

Support for multiple textbooks  Currently, The Story of the World is the only textbook that is indexed.  I want to add other homeschool and public school textbooks and link resources to those as well.


Crowdsourcing functionality  In order for the website to grow exponentially, I need to
allow other people to add resources to the database.  I’ve already had people volunteering to help,
so I need to add the ability for these people to contribute to the site.
In the future, I want students to be able to go to the page associated with a chapter in their textbook and see many resources, including books, movies, articles, online videos, activities, field trip ideas, etc.  Users should have options for sorting and filtering to find the best resources of each type that will meet their needs.Why I need your help
I have already invested many, many hours in the development and promotion of the site up to this
point, with only a few donations.  However, the growth of the website is severely limited by the fact that I cannot afford to spend more time working on it. 
My goal is to raise $20,000, so that I will be able to set
aside some of my freelance projects and spend more time working to complete the critical
features listed above by April 2015.
If I exceed my funding goals, I have a long list of additional
features that I would like to add, including: 

Personal organizational tools, to allow users to maintain
their own private lists and notes
A forum to allow for user discussions
Search functionality allowing users to find resources by
topic, time period, author, etc.

On the other hand, if I am not able to meet my goal of
$20,000, I will use whatever money I raise to add as many resources and features as I am able
to.  Even if phase two is not fully
funded, I would eventually like to complete all of the critical features; however,
doing the work in my “spare time” (haha!) would require the work to be spread
out over a much longer period.

Perks — What do you get in return?

Most of the potential donors to this campaign are probably families that intend to use the website themselves and/or people who just love America and its founding principles.  I believe that you probably care more about the impact of your donation more than any ""stuff"" (T-shirts, mugs, etc.) that you could get in return.  With this in mind, I wanted to come up with perks that would help maximize the reach of this campaign, and provide some value to businesses or organizations that would like to make larger donations.

I'm offering 3 sponsorship levels: Minuteman for a donation of any size, and, for larger donations, Lexington and Yorktown sponsorships allow you to advertise your business/organization on the RestoringHistory.US website.

Minuteman Sponsorships

I have developed a webpage that will allow you to create a
custom graphic with your personal profile image and name, OR your business/organization logo and name.  You will be given access to this web page to create your graphic and share it on social networks.

Sharing this graphic will serve a dual purpose: to publicly recognize your contribution, and to help spread the word about the campaign further. See the ""Johnny Doe"" graphic below for an example.


Lexington & Yorktown Sponsorships
For larger donations, I can offer your organization/business
a listing on the Sponsors page on RestoringHistory.US.  Yorktown Sponsors ($1,000+ donations) will have their logos
displayed at the top of the sponsors page, with Lexington Sponsors ($250-$999 donations) underneath
them.  
In addition, a smaller logo (max. 55x55 pixels) will be placed in the site
header that will be displayed in all pages of the website.  Yorktown Sponsors will receive guaranteed
placement of their logo in this sponsors section on every page view.  Logos for Lexington Sponsors
will be displayed in this section on a rotational basis, with a minimum of one
Lexington Sponsor displayed on every page view.

Both the large logos and small header logos will be linked to your URL. These will be displayed through July 4, 2016.


The screenshot below shows the Yorktown Sponsors section and the Lexington Sponsors section, as well as the section for smaller logos in the top-left of the page. The Twitter feed on the right will appear while the Indiegogo campaign is active. After that, it will be removed — hopefully, to make more room for sponsor logos!



Since launching the site, I've focused on creating a blog
and building a social media presence on Twitter, Facebook, and Google+.  This effort has gone well, and I’ve connected
with lots of people and brought increasingly more traffic to the site, as shown
in the graph below.  This should give you a rough idea of the number of impressions your logos might receive in the sponsors section in the page header.



I anticipate that this upward trend
will continue, if funding allows me to resume blogging and staying active on social media. I don't know if growth will continue to be exponential like it was in June/July, but I do expect many visitors to return multiple times, after these new features
are added, and more resources are listed.

What if you can’t afford to donate to the campaign?
Even if you cannot contribute financially, you can spread
the word about the campaign.  Use the share
buttons at the top of this page to share it on Facebook, Twitter, or
Google+.  Email it to your friends or
link to it on your webpage.  Any way that
you can help will be greatly appreciated!
I am hoping that this campaign will be successful, allowing
me to add new functionality which is critical to its future success.  Please consider joining with me to make the
vision of RestoringHistory.US a reality, helping raise a generation of young
Americans who will lead us back to the principles of freedom.
One final note... Filing for 501(c)(3) tax-exempt statusIf this campaign exceeds its goal, or if I get feedback that people are interested in providing ongoing financial support, I would love to form a nonprofit corporation and 
file for 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status.  I did not want to do this before
 running the Indiegogo campaign because I do not have time or money to 
deal with lawyers, accountants, and mounds of paperwork right now.  I also didn't want to risk going through the process only to be delayed or 
denied by the Obama-controlled IRS, as many other conservative groups 
have.  For now, my top priority is to get the majority of this new 
functionality up and running ASAP, to start making RestoringHistory.US useful for 
students and their families.

Most of the content; archived articles, videos, and research will be behind a firewall and reserved for paid members only.  When an unregistered visitor arrives at our membership website firewall, they will be presented with conversion architecture with an offer to pay for access to the premium content.  The content that is not behind a firewall  is optimized for search engines so new audience members can be acquired.  Paid subscribers will be recognized and presented with architecture that will permit them to log in and immediately access the premium information.  Depending on price and perceived value of our paid content we expect one to five percent of the visitors will choose to become paid subscribers.  Our approach is to offer our audience free components of our subscription website.  The free content is used to promote the premium content.  Our free content offerings will show our users what the content is like before asking for money.  We intend to create a trusting relationship with our core audience members.  The fundamentals of how to achieve a large subscription membership are simple and proven. What will work at the micro level can generally be leveraged to work just as well at the macro level.  Success can be achieved by testing at the micro level, then applying cash, time and energy to scale it up to the macro level.  Adequate  cash is the ultimate fuel for growing a subscription model.  Time and energy represent the application to make it happen.  With a strong marketing budget, we can rapidly buy our way to certain minimum volumes of subscribers.  The internet is filled with poorly funded businesses.  Most subscription websites spend years trying to reach revenues of even 200K per year.</p>

Typical newsletters charge $25 - $50 per thousand for daily emails and $100 - $250 for dedicated ads.</p>

BIDS4BONDS.COM
A Subscription Website Newsletter To Educate Investors

The  goal of our subscription website and newsletter is to educate our users to the pit falls and opportunities for fixed income investors. Our subscribers will pay for specific business and investment related articles and information.  Our website will deliver unique, original, and one of a kind material, along with an aggregation of various content that will draw visitors to our site. 

 Then after evaluating our content they will subscribe. 

Our goal is to create a community of inter-related individuals who share a common interest.  
A membership subscription website is user driven and content based.  Our website will be a destination in and of itself.  Our business goal is to generate revenue from user access fees by acquiring and retaining members.  We will also create a newsletter whose minimum information unit is an issue of a publication.
To attract subscribers we will offer some free content which will be available to visitors or registered guests. Most of the content; archived articles, videos, and research will be behind a firewall and reserved for paid members only.  When an unregistered visitor arrives at our membership website firewall, they will be presented with conversion architecture with an offer to pay for access to the premium content.  The content that is not behind a firewall  is optimized for search engines so new audience members can be acquired.  Paid subscribers will be recognized and presented with architecture that will permit them to log in and immediately access the premium information.  Depending on price and perceived value of our paid content we expect one to five percent of the visitors will choose to become paid subscribers.  Our approach is to offer our audience free components of our subscription website.  The free content is used to promote the premium content.  Our free content offerings will show our users what the content is like before asking for money.  We intend to create a trusting relationship with our core audience members.  The fundamentals of how to achieve a large subscription membership are simple and proven. What will work at the micro level can generally be leveraged to work just as well at the macro level.  Success can be achieved by testing at the micro level, then applying cash, time and energy to scale it up to the macro level.  Adequate  cash is the ultimate fuel for growing a subscription model.  Time and energy represent the application to make it happen.  With a strong marketing budget, we can rapidly buy our way to certain minimum volumes of subscribers.  The internet is filled with poorly funded businesses.  Most subscription websites spend years trying to reach revenues of even 200K per year.

Other Revenue-Paid Ads

The E Newsletter will be ancillary to begin with.  With the probability of a small number of subscribers in the first and second year it will be tough to attract paid ads from brands with budgets.  The amount paid per ad is tied to the size of the subscription list.  Our plan is to focus on subscriber growth until our list is north of 5,000 before ramping up a significant and expensive sales program.  Ad rates are based on the number of emails sent (cost per thousand). Typical newsletters charge $25 - $50 per thousand for daily emails and $100 - $250 for dedicated ads.

What Makes Us Special

Along with a library of related content we will provide ongoing strategy reports, research, actionable investing opportunities, videos, celebrity interviews and market data to our subscribers.  Our website and subscription services will target consumers who have a pre-existing desire to buy the content on our site.  Our website and subscription services will offer our target audience content that they are looking for but can’t find, or in one place on the net. 

Subscription Websites

Subscription websites attract new subscribers through a combination of SEO placement on search engines, paid marketing campaigns and other free activities.  Over time other premium subscriptions can be developed and current subscribers can be converted or become repeat buyers for their existing service.  It is estimated that the cost to acquire  a subscriber can be recovered with a lifetime value of 3X – 5X, more than the cost to attract.  Publishers with subscription websites customarily offer up to fifteen percent of their overall content to unregistered visitors, with the remainder accessible only by subscribers.  The decision on what and how much content to open to  all and what is available only to registered users or paid subscribers depends on a flexible marketing strategy and the scope and intent of the website.  Our plan is to have a membership subscription website which will provide paid members with valuable information on a specific topic of interest or a cluster of topics .

Action Plan

 •  Identify target market – no gut guesses --Choose the right target audience.  Discover what buyers want and don’t want.  What is our product and what is it’s value and purpose?
 •  Develop subscription price strategy
 •  Create budget and source of funding
 • Website development --Create a plan detailing how the mechanics of subscription and content publishing are to be handled.  The site must continually adjust and refine to make it appealing and valuable to subscribers.
 • Content is King –-Collect existing content from other publishers.  Recruit writers and develop unique investment articles and videos.  Determine the frequency that we will be contacting our subscribers.  Set up a timeline from production to delivery.
 • Sign Up Subscribers –-Develop subscribers using organic marketing efforts, lead generation and building an email list.  Identify email marketing service to facilitate growth.
 • Survival Strategy –-Plan for and create a budget that permits our site to stay in business long enough so that revenues catch up to accumulated and current expenses.

<h3></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1234088/files/20150219132410-sleeping_monk_seal.jpg?1424381050"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The
 Hawaiian Monk Seal is considered to be the most endangered mammal on 
earth; only about 1100 individuals remain. Most of these animals live in
 the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, far from human contact, but a couple
 hundred of them now reside in the main Hawaiian Islands. Despite being 
critically endangered, the importance of these ocean inhabitants is not 
always appreciated or understood. There is often misinformation spread 
about their origin and their role in the environment. The spread of 
misinformation can often lead to unfortunate events.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1262625/files/20150302135542-M._Sullivan._NOAA_Permit__10137-6.jpg?1425333342"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Photo: Mark Sullivan, NOAA NMFS Permit#10137-6<br/>
<p><span>In

 2014, five healthy Monk Seal pups were born on Kauai, but in July of 
2014, one of those female pups was killed in a dog attack. In fact, at 
least five endangered Hawaiian Monk Seals have been killed (by unnatural
 causes) since 2011.  A second female pup died (from head trauma) in 
December of 2014 . According to the necropsy, the pup did not die of 
natural causes. NOAA officials stated that the death of these female 
pups, makes the recovery of the species particularly challenging.</span></p>

<p>We
 at Storybook Theatre believe that children have empathy for the 
creatures of the world and are most receptive to learning about their 
importance and the importance of conservation of all rare and endangered
 species. Bringing an educational program such as this directly to

<p>It will cost approximately $2500 to bring Evelyn to Kauai and for her residency. </p>

The
 Hawaiian Monk Seal is considered to be the most endangered mammal on 
earth; only about 1100 individuals remain. Most of these animals live in
 the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, far from human contact, but a couple
 hundred of them now reside in the main Hawaiian Islands. Despite being 
critically endangered, the importance of these ocean inhabitants is not 
always appreciated or understood. There is often misinformation spread 
about their origin and their role in the environment. The spread of 
misinformation can often lead to unfortunate events.Photo: Mark Sullivan, NOAA NMFS Permit#10137-6
In

 2014, five healthy Monk Seal pups were born on Kauai, but in July of 
2014, one of those female pups was killed in a dog attack. In fact, at 
least five endangered Hawaiian Monk Seals have been killed (by unnatural
 causes) since 2011.  A second female pup died (from head trauma) in 
December of 2014 . According to the necropsy, the pup did not die of 
natural causes. NOAA officials stated that the death of these female 
pups, makes the recovery of the species particularly challenging.

We
 at Storybook Theatre believe that children have empathy for the 
creatures of the world and are most receptive to learning about their 
importance and the importance of conservation of all rare and endangered
 species. Bringing an educational program such as this directly to 
children in schools can have an amplified effect as it reaches the homes
 of those children as well. The ""Imagination with Responsibility"" Tour 
of inflatables is an attempt to bring more accurate information to the 
community and foster respect for endangered species and their 
importance. It is our hope that as these children grow, they will become
 the ambassadors of these rare animals and the ocean environment which 
is also rapidly changing. Now is the Time to Educate Children about Endangered Marine Mammals using Life Size  Inflatable Classrooms 


The Storybook Theatre of Hawaii is expanding their proven Educational Inflatable Whale Program to include the endangered Hawaiian Monk Seal, one of the rarest mammals in the world! This program already reaches thousands of children every year by bringing life sized inflatable whales to young children to teach them about the importance of marine mammals in the marine ecosystem.

This year, Storybook Theater is expanding its fleet of inflatables to include the endangered Hawaiian Monk Seal. World-renowned inflatable maker, Evelyn Roth of Festival Arts will be coming to Kauai from Australia to create two baby Monk Seals. Evelyn will also be gifting Storybook Theatre with a 30ft seal if our fundraising goal is reached. (See more about Evelyn Roth below)
While they still pack the WOW factor, these inflatables are NOT bouncy houses! Instead, they double as inflatable classrooms that can be brought to children right in their schools so that they can learn about these magestic animals on-site. The ""Imagination with Responsibility"" Tour will add the inflatable Monk Seals and Monk seal education component to the existing Inflatable Humpback Whale Tour. The tour will also be expanded to reach more children.

Creating New Hawaiian Monk Seal Inflatables Your donation will help bring Evelyn Roth to Kauai to create the baby Monk Seal inflatables. Additional educational materials will also be created. This will include the program itself and an educational coloring and activity book that can be given to teachers and students to reinforce topics that were introduced during the program. 



It will cost approximately $2500 to bring Evelyn to Kauai and for her residency. 
The inflatable seals will cost $4500 to create, but upon their creation, Storybook Theatre will be gifted with an adult inflatable seal that is valued at $6000 for no additional charge, thanks to the generosity of Evelyn Roth.

Challenges Facing our Teachers and Schools 

While there are always exceptional schools and exceptional
teachers, many schools are often at a disadvantage when delivering creative
programs because they can get bogged down with new common core standards,
national testing, IEPs, meetings, and an ever-increasing load of administrative
work. These schools must stretch their limited resources to cover the entire
educational spectrum. 
Storybook Theatre's Solution
Storybook Theatre is a nonprofit organization that is
devoted to developing and delivering programs with a specific focus. Storybook
Theater seeks grant funding and now crowd funding which enables the staff to
create much more vibrant, engaging programs than schools are able to develop and
deliver. In this manner, schools can simply call upon Storybook Theatre to
deliver the program right to their school with no extra prep for teachers or
staff.

Japanese Translation絶滅の危機にあるハワイアンモンクシール、希少な海洋哺乳動物の存在ハワイアンモンクシール（あざらし）は、地球上で最も絶滅の危機に瀕した哺乳類であると見なされている。約1,100頭 だけが生き残っていると思われる。これらの動物の殆どは北西ハワイ諸島に住んでいるが人間との接触はない。今そのうちの数百頭はハワイ州の主要な島の周りにいる。ハワイアンモンクシールは、地球上で最も絶滅の危機に瀕しているにもかかわらず、海洋生物の重要性は認められていないだけでなく、理解もされていない。その起源と環境の中の役割について誤った情報が広まっている。それは不運な出来事にもつながる。2014年、５頭の美しいモンクシールの子が生まれたが、その中の雌のアザラシ一頭が犬の攻撃で殺された。実際、2011年から少なくとも５頭の絶滅危惧なハワイアンモンクシールがすでに殺されている。(不自然な死因にて)  二頭目の雌アザラシが2014年12月死亡。剖検によると、死因は不明で老衰とは考えられない。NOAAの関係者はこれらの雌の死亡は生物種の回復困難になると述べた。ストーリーブックシアターは子供達が世界の生き物に大きな共感を持ち、稀で絶滅寸前の種族の大切さとその保護の重要性を学び受ける素晴らしい 可能性に夢をたくしている。この教育プログラムが学校の子供達へ、そこから更に家庭へと増幅効果があるでしょう。‘責任と共に想像’インフレータブル*ツアーは更に沢山の正確な情報をコミュニティーに提供し、絶滅危惧にある動物種への尊敬そしてその重要性を培う。この子供達が成長すると共に、彼らが 海洋環境 の急激な 変化と稀な動物の大使となる事を願っています。＊インフレータブル：ヘリウム、ガスや熱した空気を注入して人や動物、製品等の形に大きく立ち上がらせたもの。（写真）実物大のインフレ−タブルクラスルームを使用し絶滅寸前の海洋哺乳類について子供達へ教育ストーリーシアターオブハワイは クジラと 世界で最も希少動物の一つのハワイアンモンクシールも加え 、実績のあるインフレータブル教育プログラムを提供し、さらに拡大しています。このプログラムは 海洋生態系において海洋哺乳類の重要性 を教えるのに実際のサイズのクジラのインフレータブルを用いて、 既に毎年千人の子供達に会い、プログラムを伝えています。プログラムについて知りたい方、こちらをご覧下さい‘今年はストーリーブックシアターは絶滅の危惧にあるハワイアンモンクシールを含め、さらに楽しいイベントも企画しています。フェスティバルアーティストのエブリンロスがアーストラリアからカウアイ島にモンクシールのベイビー２頭を布で創作しにやって来ます。この資金調達のゴールに達成した場合、エブリンはストーリーシアターに914メートルのアザラシを贈与して下さる様です。現場の壮大なクジラを学校で体験できるようにインフレータブルクラスルームをダブルにした。ツアーはクジラに加えて、モンクシールのインフレータブルと、その教育要素をとりいれました。ツアーが多くの子供達に届くことを願っている。皆様の寄付金はベイビーモンクシールのインフレータブルを創作するエブリンのカウアイ訪問の大きなお手伝いとなります。更に追加の教育教材もあるでしょう。プログラムの中で紹介されたトピックを強化するために、先生と生徒さんに差し上げるエディケーショナルカラーリング、アクティビティーブックがあります。エブリンのカウアイ島訪問と滞在費用はおおよそ$2,500です。モンクシールのインフレータブル創作費は$4,500。エブリンは実際$6,000 の価値があるものを追加請求なしで、贈与して下さるそうです。大変ありがたいものです。パケット、ワークシートの本、カラーリングシート、ゲーム、歌、アクティビティーに関係したものから成る追加の教材はおおよそ$2,000。これらの教材は下の写真にあるワークシートを含む。そしてこれらは、地元の子供向けの教材を創作する達人の、ルーシッド出版の協力関係で作られた。ツアーをハワイ、パシフィックの子供達に届ける料金一定してませんが、航空運賃、荷物、送迎, 宿泊を含みます。Indigogoを通しての寄付金はツアーの費用として使われます。ストーリーブックシアターは引き続き,ツアーの資金となる補助金のサポートが必要です。皆様のご協力宜しくお願いします。海洋哺乳動物の教育についてストーリーブックシアターはザトウクジラのインフレータブルツアーで2002年からハワイの沢山の子供達に逢ってきました。このユニークで魅力的なザトウクジラのインフレータブルのプログラムでこれからの子供達にパシフィックザトウクジラ、その移動回遊、海洋エコシステムのルールを歌、ゲーム、手話、そしてお話を通して教えます。ツアーは年間、5000人以上の子供に出逢。そして今、さらに世界の子供達逢える為に皆様のお手伝いでインフレータブルのモンクシールを創作したいのです。どうぞご協力をお願いいたします。/ストーリーブックシアターについてストーリーブックシアターは子供達にパフォーマンスとヴィジュアルアートを通して、３０年以上にも渡って教育プログラムを提供してきました。私達の主な目的は環境とアートの教育の普及の働きかけ、文化の多様性の分ち合い、グローバルそして市民権の理解の促進、子供達にアートメディアやパフォーマンスの参加と経験,お話を通して子供と家族に伝達し支援する。更に詳しい情報はこちらのサイトにてwww.storybook.orgエブリンとアートフェスティバルについてエブリンロスのアートフェスティバルがオーストラリアのアデレードで開催された。彼女は今回のカウアイ島のストーリーブックシアターにてのハーモニーメロディーのインフレータブルクジラのクリエーターだけでなく、コミュニティーそして世界に環境の意識と創作の楽しみをシェアするのに２００種に渡るインフレータブルの生き物を創作してきた布のマスターです。彼女は ナイロン動物園*のクリエーター女王で、彼女の創作は環境危機への意識を高めてくれる。彼女の作品は主なフェスティバル、ギャラリー、オーストラリアや香港や韓国、とアメリカ、カナダ、ブラジル、アフリカ、そしてニュージーランドで見られてきている。*http://evelynrothoz.com/photos-2/index.html先生と学校が直面するチャレンジ学校、先生が全てそうである訳でないが、クリエイティブなプログラムを教えるにあたり、 全米共通学力標準、国のテスト,ひき続き増える管理業務等で動きがとれない為、殆どの学校は不利な立場にある。これらの学校は 教育活動範囲全体をカバーし、限られた資源をを充実する必要がある。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　 ストーリーブックシアターの解決策ストーリーブックシアターは明確なフォーカスでプログラムを生み出し発展することに情熱を注ぐ非営利団体です。私達はスタッフが学校にはない活気があり魅力のあるプログラムを作り出すための助成金、資金支援,クラウドファンディング*を求めています。そういうことで、学校は先生やスタッフの事前準備なしでストーリーブックシアターにプログラムの配達を電話一本でできると言う事です！*インターネット等で資金調達の方法の一つ世界で最も絶滅の危機にある哺乳類の教育への助けに加え、あなたの貢献は、楽しい特典付きで、あなた自身そしてあなたの団体方々へと届くでしょう。大変な経済の中で、誰もが私達のキャンペンへの寄付金をできない事は十分理解しておりますが、他にも皆様ができる事があります:　このキャンペンができ限りの沢山の方々に渡る様に知り合いや友達、沢山の方にこのIndigogo を使ってメール伝えたり、FBでシェアしたり、広めて下さい。宜しくお願いします。",18.0,2,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Evolution of LessonPlanPro</h3>
<p>After attending a personal growth workshop (PSI Basic Seminar)more than 2
years ago, I wrote a mission statement that I posted on LinkedIn, without
having any idea of how I would ever accomplish it:</p>
<p><b>""Utilize my 20+ years
of experience in publishing/communications, non-profit management, and
orchestra education to create a viable income source for underpaid musicians

very successful site that caters primarily to elementary teachers of core
academic subjects. LessonPlanPro focuses on supporting <b><i>arts </i></b>programs at all levels — a segment of the teaching
profession with very unique needs and challenges.</p>
<p>I have been working on transforming this concept into a startup
while continuing to teach full-time as a high school orchestra director, a career
that demands quite a few more hours than 40 per week! People who told me “it
will take 10 times longer and 10 times more money than you expect to start a
business” were correct! I came to my senses and realized I will be so much
more successful if I reach out for support.</p>
<p>I am so excited now to have the backing of two committed
partners and two amazing advisers. What’s missing is the capital to upgrade the
website and do a proper marketing launch. For the last two years, I have
invested <u>all</u> of my personal savings and disposable income, as well as
nearly every second of free time, into making this project a reality. A recent cancer
diagnosis has thrown a wrench into my plans. The time has come to go outside of

<p>Our next generation of women leaders is suffering. The American College Health Association reported in 2011 that 91% of female college students felt “overwhelmed.” USA Today reported last year that female college freshmen’s emotional health hit an all-time low. Only 46% surveyed would rate their emotional health as “above average.” This pressure to “do it all” and to do it perfectly is manifesting itself in low self-esteem, poor relationship choices, anxiety, depression, eating disorders and suicides.</p>
<p>Living away from home for the first time, the stress of wanting to succeed, adapting to new routines and studies, trying to make new friends, getting insufficient sleep, feeling pressure to use alcohol and drugs, worrying about money – it all takes a toll.</p>
<p>After her own personal experience with depression, Dr Tanya wants to encourage women of all ages to make their health &amp; well-being a priority, not an afterthought. Dr. Tanya seeks to specifically engage college-aged/millennial women (undergraduate &amp; graduate) around the globe in a discussion on mental/emotional wellness.  <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Dr Tanya has also launched a national pledge campaign, <i>Stress Free Sorority (SFS) </i>that invites women to </span><strong style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""><a href=""http://www.drtanyadouglasholland.com/StressFreeSorority/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">TAKE THE PLEDGE </a> </strong><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">and seeks to</span><strong style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""> </strong><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">promote discussions and increase awareness around emotional and physical well-being.</span></p>
<p>The Pledge:</p>
<p>• <strong>MONITOR</strong> and be honest about my feelings</p>

<p>• <strong>TALK</strong> to someone if I feel overwhelmed, depressed, or suicidal</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p></p> <p>In 2013, with the support of over 50 contributors, the <i>Developing Leaders in Women's Health Award</i> successfully supported one exceptional student to attend the Women's Mental Health Congress in Lima, Peru.  Ideally, the 2014-2015 Award Campaign seeks to exceed our funding goal in order to open the door for more deserving young women to benefit. Imagine the impact that these students will have, armed with their new found knowledge to educate others on their campuses and beyond! Together, we can erase the myths and the stigma that surround mental health issues. <br/></p>

</div>","Introduction 
Our next generation of women leaders is suffering. The American College Health Association reported in 2011 that 91% of female college students felt “overwhelmed.” USA Today reported last year that female college freshmen’s emotional health hit an all-time low. Only 46% surveyed would rate their emotional health as “above average.” This pressure to “do it all” and to do it perfectly is manifesting itself in low self-esteem, poor relationship choices, anxiety, depression, eating disorders and suicides.
Living away from home for the first time, the stress of wanting to succeed, adapting to new routines and studies, trying to make new friends, getting insufficient sleep, feeling pressure to use alcohol and drugs, worrying about money – it all takes a toll.
After her own personal experience with depression, Dr Tanya wants to encourage women of all ages to make their health & well-being a priority, not an afterthought. Dr. Tanya seeks to specifically engage college-aged/millennial women (undergraduate & graduate) around the globe in a discussion on mental/emotional wellness.  Dr Tanya has also launched a national pledge campaign, Stress Free Sorority (SFS) that invites women to TAKE THE PLEDGE  and seeks to promote discussions and increase awareness around emotional and physical well-being.
The Pledge:
• MONITOR and be honest about my feelings
• ENGAGE in activities to manage and minimize stress
• TALK to someone if I feel overwhelmed, depressed, or suicidal

What We Need & What You Get
 


Dr Tanya is on a mission to raise funds to support the attendance of of ONE (aiming for 2) college student (graduate or undergraduate) at the 6th World Congress on Women’s Mental Health in Tokyo, Japan in March 22-25, 2015. Together, we will collaborate on an international scale to learn about

Social, economic, ethical, cultural and biological factors that affect women’s mental health
Women’s roles in marriage, family and society, and how it affects their mental health
The causes, effects and elimination of domestic violence/abuse on women
Better education and public information about women’s mental health
Gender-specific treatment and prevention
And much more!

 Where Do Your Donations Go? 

FUNDS raised will off-set student's travel & registration, to include:








The Impact
 In 2013, with the support of over 50 contributors, the Developing Leaders in Women's Health Award successfully supported one exceptional student to attend the Women's Mental Health Congress in Lima, Peru.  Ideally, the 2014-2015 Award Campaign seeks to exceed our funding goal in order to open the door for more deserving young women to benefit. Imagine the impact that these students will have, armed with their new found knowledge to educate others on their campuses and beyond! Together, we can erase the myths and the stigma that surround mental health issues.

I have had the privilege of wearing the cloth of the nation, serving you, for over 30 years. I need your help. More specifically, our children, and in many respects your children, need your help.</p>
<p>I am a member of the Scarlet and Gold Committee of Arizona and we are raising money for college scholarships, as part of the Marine Corps Scholarship Foundation, for the children of Marines and Navy Corpsman who served with Marines.</p>
<p>Our goal this year is $1million dollars. We have never asked for the help of everyday Americans. Marines pride themselves on taking care of each other and never being a burden to others. I am convinced that American people care for their Marines and Navy Corpsman as much as they do each other. So, I am asking for your help.</p>
<p>I am asking, no, I am confident that American People will help us raise at least $25,000 towards our goal of $1million.</p>
<p>The money we raise will go directly towards the scholarships for the children of Marines and Navy Corpsman who served with Marines. Those who donate in excess of $250 will receive an invitation to our 11 May 2013 Awards Dinner.</p>
<p>A short story—in April 2008 two young Marines stood their post in a town known as Ramadi in Iraq. It was considered the most dangerous place on earth at the time. The two Marines had just taken their post and given the normal orders …no unauthorized personnel or vehicles are to pass. Shortly after assuming their duties, a truck turned into the ally way and picked up speed. It was apparent that it was not going to stop. The two Marines did their duty. They fired into the truck, stopping it just short of where they were posted. It exploded. They did not survive.</p>
<p>Sadly, this is not uncommon in combat. Marines are killed, and many suffer wounds that will be with them for a lifetime. This incident, however, was caught on a nearby surveillance video camera. The video showed that the entire event took six seconds. The last views of the camera showed the police officers fleeing as any normal person would do. The truck was picking up speed. The Marines never wavered; the truck was stopped, and in an instant, it exploded. Had the truck been able to get past the Marines it would have ended up in a barracks area where Marines and their Iraqi counterparts sleep.</p>
<p>One of the Marines, a young corporal, had a wife, two children, and a mother and sister that lived with him. His salary was about $23,000 annually. His children, and the many other children of Marines and Navy Corpsman, should they want to go to college, will not be stopped because of a lack of funding. That is why the Scarlet and Gold Committee is in full support of the Marine Corps Scholarship Foundation. That is why we are going to raise $1million this year. That is why I am asking everyday American People to participate in this effort.</p>
<p>I ask that you contribute what you can; if you cannot please pass along to your friends and shipmates what we are trying to do.</p>

<p>At the Community Mediation Center (CMC) we know that Conflict Transformation Training Changes Lives.  We’ve been helping people find peaceful ways of solving conflict for 13 years, serving more than 30,000 people in the Kansas City area, with mediation, dialogue facilitation and training. CMC is a non-profit 501(c) 3, and no one is turned away because of a lack of ability to pay for service.  A small staff and many volunteers go to sites that are convenient for participants, and provide processes for respectful interaction, resulting in a plan to move forward in peaceful ways. </p>
<h2>Preventing Headlines by Changing Lives</h2>
<h3>Safe and Connected Communities</h3>
<p>This project, Safe and Connected Communities, will provide a conflict resolution training experience for Kansas City residents in areas that are high risk for conflict and violence.  The training will teach the principles of Restorative Justice; all parties affected by conflict are included in plans to make things as right as possible moving forward.  A circle format will invite learning and a deep connection between participants, forming a core group of individuals who will support each other during and after the experience.  Participants will create a project to take back to their communities that will hold up the concepts of Conflict Resolution they have learned.</p>
<h2>The Problem:</h2>
<p>Homicide is the leading cause of death for persons aged 16-40 in Kansas City, Missouri.  Homicides account for more than 75% of KCMO’s violent crime in an area labeled the ‘Urban Core’ which accounts for only 9% of the city’s land mass (30 out of 320 square miles). Studies show that violence stems from unresolved interpersonal conflict, often beginning as a misunderstanding and escalating to out-of-control reactions to simple situations.  Although most residents attempt to live their lives in a law-abiding manner, persons overwhelmed by life, and dealing with social and economic woes, have created a different norm. </p>
<h2>Our Solution:</h2>
<p>Your contribution allows us to put trained peacemakers as ""boots-on-the ground"" in our neighborhoods. Violence is a learned behavior and can be affected by combining evidence-based and innovative interventions.  Every community houses bright and energetic people who have a great capacity to foster and create positive change.  Safe and Connected Communities brings training and hands-on experience in conflict resolution to residents in the community who are best poised to spread the skills to others around them, creating a different norm from the inside out. <em><strong>Peace going viral!</strong></em></p>
<p>Executive Director Annette Lantz-Simmons, MA: “I have witnessed hundreds of examples of reconciliation between parties that never dreamed they could come together, talk through their issues and co-create a plan to move forward in peaceful ways.  There is a new wave of collaboration and respect that is washing through our area.  We are helping to stir the waters!”</p>
<h2>What We Need:</h2>
<p>We need $19,950 to provide conflict resolution training experience for 3 groups of up to 25 participants, 5 sessions each group, meeting weekly for 5 weeks.</p>

 Acrobatics is a parkour and freerunning gym that features aerial 
fabric, tumbling, martial arts, dance, and other acrobatic arts.  The 
parkour and freerunning classes were originally taught out of 5280 
Gymnastics; one of the top gymnastic gyms in the state.  Soon these 
classes were being offered in three different gyms in order 
to accommodate student enrollment.  It has become clear that a dedicated
 facility is needed to accommodate the program.  Urban Acrobatics is now
 a 14,000 square foot facility dedicated to movement and acrobatic arts.</p><p>   Today, 
students continue to grow in skill and  in number.  Urban Acrobatics is 
in a position to set the new standard for fun, fitness, and safety in 
the acrobatic sports community. With your help, this gym the will 
provide training equipment for kids, soft landing mats, and exciting new
 parkour obstacles.  Your

   Urban
 Acrobatics is a parkour and freerunning gym that features aerial 
fabric, tumbling, martial arts, dance, and other acrobatic arts.  The 
parkour and freerunning classes were originally taught out of 5280 
Gymnastics; one of the top gymnastic gyms in the state.  Soon these 
classes were being offered in three different gyms in order 
to accommodate student enrollment.  It has become clear that a dedicated
 facility is needed to accommodate the program.  Urban Acrobatics is now
 a 14,000 square foot facility dedicated to movement and acrobatic arts.   Today, 
students continue to grow in skill and  in number.  Urban Acrobatics is 
in a position to set the new standard for fun, fitness, and safety in 
the acrobatic sports community. With your help, this gym the will 
provide training equipment for kids, soft landing mats, and exciting new
 parkour obstacles.  Your

big or small, we want to help make it happen! Weather it involves

addition to  offering classes  spanning from  woodworking,
metalworking, pattern making, jewelry making, and forging, we want to
offer rotating ""boutique"" classes that will specialize in a

<p>     We

local talent as well as to give each of our students the opportunity
to succeed by using those talents in a real-world setting. Many of

<p>     One
thing that we are especially passionate about is teaching  young

campaign you will be helping to keep Industrial Art alive and well.
Without early exposure to shop class many kids will fall through the
cracks and miss out on the opportunity to discover that they like
making things, or the inclination to pursue a career as a designer,
wood worker, welder, mechanic, machinist or artist. We recognize a
real need for education and exposure to Industrial Art and we want to
provide a place to champion creativity and opportunity.</p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">
<b>The

</h2>
<p>     ""…the
skilled trades are undervalued in America. They are undervalued in
the American educational system that has systematically eliminated
shop class. They are undervalued in the collective consciousness that
views them as lowly, “blue collar”, dirty, unprofessional. But,
the funny thing is that there is one place where they are actually
not undervalued at all, and that is in the marketplace, which has
seen a greater and greater demand for the skilled craftsman, be he a
carpenter, electrician, machinist, mechanic, and so on. On account of
his being in demand, the skilled tradesman has his choice of jobs,
needs answer to no one, and earns a living wage, perks that are not
to be scoffed at in this economic environment.""</p>

<p>Hi there!  My name is
Miranda and I am a math teacher at Woodridge High School in Peninsula, Ohio.  I have been teaching for eight years.  I have a Bachelors degree in Finance and
Accounting and a Masters in Curriculum and Instruction.  Teaching
is my passion and I enjoy opening my students’ eyes to the wonders of
mathematics. </p>
<p>Recently, Ohio has changed its graduation requirements to
include Algebra 2.  This course requires
a TI-84 Graphing Calculator.  Many of my
students are unable to afford this piece of technology, 57% of them actually.  I often call this calculator a lifeline
because it is so extremely important to the understanding of Algebra 2
concepts.  I am advocating for these kids
so they can get an advantage where one might not otherwise exist.   Imagine trying to type an email without a computer, hammering in nails without a hammer, or mowing ten acres of grass with a push mower.  </p>
<p>If you contribute, you will be affecting the lives of high
school students for years to come.  I
will continue to use these calculators like a textbook, collecting at the end
of each year, and allowing upcoming students to benefit from your contribution.  Students will get higher GPAs, higher ACT
scores, get into great colleges and become outstanding members of society.  </p>
<p>I need $10,000 to buy enough graphing calculators for my
students.  Kids are our future and I just
want to help them get that chance to make the most of theirs by showing them
that math can be easy and fun with technology. 
Every $100 will buy one graphing calculator.  </p>
<p>Every year the state asks us, as teachers, to do more with less.  Common Core Standards and requirements have made
teaching a challenge.  Having this tool
for my students will allow me to get through more concepts and the students
will gain a deeper understanding of math.</p>
<p>Help me show students that math opens doors!  The higher a student goes in math the more
money they will make over their lifetime. 
Math is powerful and I am the facilitator that can show them the way! </p>

          We are Novancia Business School students in Paris, France. Our program as a Master's of International Business Developing & Consulting, consisting of a group of 15 awesome international students from 12 diverse countries, ranging from Egypt to Belgium. We joined a meeting group of Parisian students from Novancia which functions to promote social interaction between new international students and the existing local student body. So far we have thoroughly enjoyed our experiences with the group, from social gatherings, to information sessions, to tours of Paris. As a result, we would like to give back to the organization so that it continues to exist for future international students who will follow in our footsteps. Please help us reach our goal so that we can provide the platform for friendships and fun times in the future!Nous sommes des étudiants internationaux

réunions d’informations, ainsi que les visites de la ville de Paris.

<p>This summer, STAR Education and Project STEPS will expand the mathematical minds of<strong> 100 low-income 9th graders with our 3-week CSI: SFV CAMP conducted at California State University Northridge (CSUN).</strong></p>
<p>Our intensive camp experience introduces students to the real-world excitement of science, technology, engineering, and math. Students will conduct DNA experiments, explore crime scenes, use algebra to investigate footprints and heights, dust for fingerprints, and finally solve their own murder mystery. Our goal is to not only have fun, but to also expose students to higher levels of math and science that might encourage future careers as well as college educations.</p>
<p>Students from 4 middle schools in the San Fernando Valley are already partially funded through a Gear Up grant, which aims to raise college attendance among low-income students. However, these funds cover only a fraction of the entire camp cost.<br/><br/><strong>The most important aspect of this camp is the capstone event where students will use math and science to solve a murder mystery brunch at Saddle Ranch Restaurant in Universal City Walk,</strong> giving the students an even closer look at how their new skills apply to the real world. We've recruited CSI actors and forensic experts to lead this exciting event, but we currently do not have funding to cover all 100 students attending this field trip.</p>
<p>Your gift will help bring math and science to these students with a hands-on, real-world experience while also giving them a positive, summer camp adventure with their classmates and teachers.</p>
<p>Here’s what your gift can do…</p>
<p><strong>$25</strong>  Support one student's trip to CSI Murder Mystery Brunch, including transportation and unlimited food and drink<br/><strong>$50</strong>  Cover the cost of two students to attend the CSI Murder Mystery Lunch<br/><strong>$100</strong>  Purchase curriculum / materials for the CSI Murder Mystery Lunch</p>
<p><strong>$500  </strong>Sponsor an entire camp team for one school</p>
<p><strong>$1500</strong>  Be the sole sponsor for the event.  We will make a banner that says ""Sponsored by X"" and make sure your name or company is mentioned throughout the Murder Mystery!</p>
<p><br/><strong>We believe this real-world experience is ESSENTIAL to students connecting with the math and science they've learned at camp as they learn to apply it outside the classroom.</strong> We hope they will leave inspired not only about going to college, but also eager to explore the many interesting careers available in math, science and related fields.<br/><br/>For as little as $25, you can give one of these students a learning experience they will never forget. You can also make a difference by sharing this campaign on your Facebook or emailing it to interested friends and family. Thank you for partnering with us! All donations are tax deductible.</p>

<p>My name is Dakotah and I have been practicing yoga for 5 years. I am a Buddhist, freelance writer, vegetarian, and musician. My yoga began at a local community college and has taken me as far away as China. Having been self-taught for the last several years, utilizing a number of valuable resources including /r/yoga, I have grown and excelled.</p>
<p>The time I spent traveling China taught me much about the world, providing me opportunity not only to experience Eastern culture but also offering interaction with travellers from all over the world. My horizons were never so broadened. I had the chance to pay my respect to the Leshan Buddha as well as to do yoga in temples and parks across the country.</p>
<p>I later lived in the Live Music Capitol of the World: Austin, Texas. During my time there, I, for the first time in my life, learned to make music. I have now been playing the ukulele for 2 years and owe much of my musical knowledge to my time in Austin, specifically at the Kerrville Folk Festival.</p>
<p>This summer, I intend to make a 6-week pilgrimage to further advance myself. The plan is to attend the Kerrville Folk Festival and then study yoga at the Asheville Yoga Center, earning a Yoga Alliance certification. This month and a half would allow me to develop my creative side and help pave my future.</p>
<p>By receiving this certificate, I will be able to teach yoga professionally. I have always dreamed of helping spread happiness to people and opening their eyes to yoga; this is my chance to make this a reality. Regardless of any perks and such, if this campaign helps me to succeed in my journey, I vow to teach a free class at least twice a month for a year to repay the cosmic energy.</p>
<h3 dir=""ltr"">What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What I'm asking for is help to pay for the actual 3-week Yoga Teacher Training class. By registering early, this entire immersion will cost only $1900 plus approximately $200 for books. The rest of the money I have requested will help pay for the air travel and lodging. I have some savings that will be helpful and can cover my basic expenses and some of the airfare but I can't afford to cover the entire cost of the class.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.youryoga.com/ayc/teacher-training/200-hour/Total-Yoga-Immersion-Asheville.html#apply"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.youryoga.com/ayc/teacher-training/200-hour/Total-Yoga-Immersion-Asheville.html</a></p>
<p>All the money raised will go directly to registration costs, travel bookings, transportation, and, if needed, feeding me on my travels. I will be able to live very cheaply while attending the folk festival but am not sure what to expect when I arrive in North Carolina.</p>
<p>Donating to this campaign means encouraging me to spread my message of love by bringing more yoga into people's lives. It will be helping me to find a career I can love by getting me to take the next step in my own life.</p>
<h3 dir=""ltr"">Perks</h3>
<p>For $5, I will meditate on whatever you wish for a few minutes, sending positive energy in your direction. I can focus a mantra of power to you or thoughts of healing restoration to a sick friend or anything else.</p>
<p>For $11, I will consult my tarot deck on your life. I was a semi-professional reader on 6th Street when I lived in Austin and consider myself rather adept with the cards. Preferably, you will give me some background information on your life beforehand and I will email you a detailed synopsis but, if nothing is provided, I can give some general oversight with surprising accuracy. Ask about love, your career, your house and family, or even your travel plans</p>
<p>For $23, you will become a patron of my art. I have been writing as a hobby since I learned how to write and had my first poem published when I was 14. This perk allows you to choose up to ten topics for me to put into poetry, though I'd recommend picking a single theme for all 10 poems. These will not be hastily scrawled but well-thought out compositions.</p>
<p>The next three tiers, at $33, $77, and $255, are your chances to reap the benefits of my education. By supporting me while I become certified to teach yoga, you will be guaranteed one-on-one time with me, via Skype, to both receive guidance for your practice as well as pick my brain for useful yoga knowledge. I will be ""fresh out of the academy"" and able to offer perspective from my tutelage. Even if you're interested in pursuing a path teaching yoga yourself, this time could be spent familiarizing yourself with my experiences getting certified.</p>
<p>For $42, I will take the time to create a unique and creative video for you of me playing any two songs your ears desire on my ukulele. I'm no Van Halen or Frank Sinatra or Kamakawiwo'ole but I'll make it sound good. I can also change lyrics to make it more personal for you or dedicate the video to a particular person. Included will be separate audio tracks for each song to put on an mp3 player or what-have-you.</p>
<p>For $89. you commission a painting. You are free to pick anything you want it to be of though results will vary. Each painting will get scads of time put into it because, honestly, I'm a pretty slow and time-consuming painter, hence the price bracket. I will say, this one's a bit of a risk if you're not into art. If you are into art, though, this perk delivers.<br/><br/></p></div>","Short Summary

What I'm asking for is help to pay for the actual 3-week Yoga Teacher Training class. By registering early, this entire immersion will cost only $1900 plus approximately $200 for books. The rest of the money I have requested will help pay for the air travel and lodging. I have some savings that will be helpful and can cover my basic expenses and some of the airfare but I can't afford to cover the entire cost of the class.
http://www.youryoga.com/ayc/teacher-training/200-hour/Total-Yoga-Immersion-Asheville.html
All the money raised will go directly to registration costs, travel bookings, transportation, and, if needed, feeding me on my travels. I will be able to live very cheaply while attending the folk festival but am not sure what to expect when I arrive in North Carolina.
Donating to this campaign means encouraging me to spread my message of love by bringing more yoga into people's lives. It will be helping me to find a career I can love by getting me to take the next step in my own life.
Perks
For $5, I will meditate on whatever you wish for a few minutes, sending positive energy in your direction. I can focus a mantra of power to you or thoughts of healing restoration to a sick friend or anything else.
For $11, I will consult my tarot deck on your life. I was a semi-professional reader on 6th Street when I lived in Austin and consider myself rather adept with the cards. Preferably, you will give me some background information on your life beforehand and I will email you a detailed synopsis but, if nothing is provided, I can give some general oversight with surprising accuracy. Ask about love, your career, your house and family, or even your travel plans
For $23, you will become a patron of my art. I have been writing as a hobby since I learned how to write and had my first poem published when I was 14. This perk allows you to choose up to ten topics for me to put into poetry, though I'd recommend picking a single theme for all 10 poems. These will not be hastily scrawled but well-thought out compositions.
The next three tiers, at $33, $77, and $255, are your chances to reap the benefits of my education. By supporting me while I become certified to teach yoga, you will be guaranteed one-on-one time with me, via Skype, to both receive guidance for your practice as well as pick my brain for useful yoga knowledge. I will be ""fresh out of the academy"" and able to offer perspective from my tutelage. Even if you're interested in pursuing a path teaching yoga yourself, this time could be spent familiarizing yourself with my experiences getting certified.
For $42, I will take the time to create a unique and creative video for you of me playing any two songs your ears desire on my ukulele. I'm no Van Halen or Frank Sinatra or Kamakawiwo'ole but I'll make it sound good. I can also change lyrics to make it more personal for you or dedicate the video to a particular person. Included will be separate audio tracks for each song to put on an mp3 player or what-have-you.
For $89. you commission a painting. You are free to pick anything you want it to be of though results will vary. Each painting will get scads of time put into it because, honestly, I'm a pretty slow and time-consuming painter, hence the price bracket. I will say, this one's a bit of a risk if you're not into art. If you are into art, though, this perk delivers.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<strong>WHAT IS KISSIDUGU?</strong>  </h3>
<p><em>Kissidugu - </em>""a safe place"" or ""place of refuge"" in the Kissi language of Guinea, West Africa.</p>
<p>And that is what your generous support will help create, a safe place; a school where youth of Guinea are being fed and educated in a sustainable and supportive environment.</p>
<p>We are The Kissidugu Foundation, a nonprofit organization. Our mission is to create sustainable and equitable opportunities for individuals and communities to access and promote cultural arts through music, dance, education and civic dialogue. The Foundation intends to inspire people of all colors, cultures, and backgrounds to connect to themselves, to one another, and to their community. Building the Kissidugu School of Music, Dance &amp; Education in Guinea is the Foundation’s primary initiative.  It will provide education opportunities, sustainable employment and access to information and resources that would otherwise be unavailable.  The school will not only scholarship Guinean Youth but will also host international students for intensive study and cross-cultural exchange. We are so very passionate about this amazing project and excited to get you involved!</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Kissidugu Dance &amp; Drum Theatre was founded in 2004 after its first dance &amp; drum conference, Camp Merveilles, in 2003.  Over the past 10 years, under the direction of West African master teacher-performer, Fara Tolno, Kissidugu Drum&amp; Dance Theatre has been dedicated to bringing performance, art, and culture to communities across the United States and abroad. The Camp Merveilles conference has continued to be an annual event in Boulder, CO since 2003. Fara and staff have taught African dance and drumming to the faculty and students of schools from the elementary to university level;sharing dance and music through workshops in communities across the US and theatrical residencies with established dance companies.</p>
<p>Since receiving non-profit status, Camp Merveilles and the Kissidugu Dance and Drum Theatre have become projects of The Kissidugu Foundation and will continue with community outreach and education in the U.S.  Currently, The Kissidugu School of Music, Dance &amp; Education is the foundation's number one focus.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We need to raise $15,000 to purchase the land for the Kissidugu School of Dance, Music &amp; Education. It is six acres of beautiful oceanfront property that is fertile and has areas of rich soil for growing food. This land will be home to the Kissidugu School of Dance, Music &amp; Education, where dreams are made manifest and traditions are upheld. </p>
<p>$15,000 for SIX ACRES!  Your dollar goes a LONG way!</p>
<p>We will be going to Guinea in December to finalize the land purchase with your generous support!</p>
<p>At this time, we are anxiously awaiting our ""Letter of Determination"" stating that we are a TAX EXEMPT non profit. Currently we are a non-profit in the state of Colorado, but are not yet tax exempt. We can retroactivate donations to be tax deductible ONCE we receive the letter, but until then we cannot. SOOO, knowing that many of you would probably like to receive a tax write off from your donations, we have decided to ask for A LOT of you to help us with small donations. IF you feel inspired to give more, and would like us to retroactivate the donation when the time comes, please let us know, we would be happy to provide that for you!</p>
<p>So that being said, you will receive small tokens of our deep appreciation, and become part of the creation and team of The Kissidugu School of Dance, Music &amp; Education.  And most importantly you will know you are doing something great on the planet! </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>The impact of the School in Guinea is huge.  Crops will be grown on site providing food and nourishment for the attendees as well as providing opportunities for surrounding villagers. In addition, the youth of Guinea have begun to lose the knowledge of their traditional music and dance. The school will serve as a living library of these traditions, giving the opportunity for Guinean Artists to pass down this ancestral knowledge. Not only will the School give Artists and Educators a place to teach, reside, and support their families, but will be a long term source of livelihood and valuable education for the youth and surrounding communities.</p>
<p>The School has four major focuses:  Food &amp; Agriculture, Technology, Language, and Traditional Dance, Music and History. The school will start small with five resident teachers and 20 scholarshipped students from Guinea each year. In addition there will be an outreach program that trains educators and teachers from Guinea, so that they can take the skills and information learned and share it with their villages and towns.  In this way we create a ripple effect that can spread to other communities, reaching beyond our faculty and student body. The School will be sustained by the annual tuition received from international students and on-going agricultural endeavors.</p>
<p>We will use recycling, upcycling and alternative building methods; using materials such as tires and plastic bottles, therfore cleaning up surrounding areas as the school is implemented.  The intention of the Kissidugu School is to be a model of what is possible for other Guinean communities in the realms of sustainability.</p>

The Wichi Art School, under the auspices of the Bhadra Kali Social Work and Development Association, has been providing primary school services to the children of ""Harijans"" or ""Dalits"" (once called ""Untouchables"" before untouchability and caste discrimination was banned in India).  The Wichi school focuses on art and music, especially tabla, the engaging traditional drums of India.  You can see an article about our early work HERE.

We also encourage our students to develop their minds through yoga, meditation and study, though we never force religion on any of our students.


The Wichi School has been funded by a few private individuals, but recently they have had to withdraw their support due to their own financial pressures.  At the same time, our school has been forced to look for a new location.  We now hope to buy a building to house our school.



In India, a few dollars can make for many rupees, but it will still take many dollars for us to resettle our school, and get the resources to take on more students (one of our most important goals).
Here is a video of one of our dance recitals:

<b>About the Writers:</b><p></p>
<p>
<b>Ananthi:</b></p>
<p>
Ananthi’s
 father Mr.Ganesan, 46, has been living with HIV/AIDS for the last eight
 years and is now infected with multiple diseases. Despite his ailing 
health, he still feeds his family of five by working as a tricycle 
loader – a day job in the scorching Chennai heat, transporting heavy 
loads from one end of the city to another. Ananthi’s mother is a 
housemaid and works in more than four homes a day to provide additional 
support for the family. Mr.Ganesan has three children.  Anand is the 
eldest and studies ITI (a technical under-graduation course) while also 
assisting his father by working as a tricycle loader.  Ananthi (our 
child-writer) is the second child and just got promoted to 9<sup>th</sup> grade.
 In addition to her school routine, she helps her mother with cooking 
and other household work.  Akash is the third child and is in 7<sup>th</sup> grade.  In addition to his family's dire situation, Akash faces the challenge of being a slow learner, and yet he still pushes himself to continue his studies.</p>
<p>
<b>Isharani:</b></p>
<p>
Isharani’s
 mother, Elizabeth, is the only earning member of the family, supporting
 her ailing parents and two minor children. The first child, 
Ajithchandran, just completed 12<sup>th</sup> grade
 and is awaiting his results. He is also a volleyball district-level 
player and aims to go on to a higher level in the sport. Our 
child-writer, Isharani, is the second child and has just finished 10<sup>th</sup> grade.
 She is a trained Bharat Natyam (Traditional dance of Tamil Nadu State) 
dancer and hopes to continue to pursue her passion for dance.</p>
<p>
<b>Srinivasan</b></p>
<p>
Our
 child-writer Srinivasan, 13, is a hearing-impaired child (deaf and 
mute). His father was just thirty-six years old when he died last year 
(in 2013) due to a massive heart-attack.  He collected old papers for 
recycling. After his death, all the family responsibilities were 
relegated to little Srinivasan and his mother.  His mother, who had been
 a house-wife until 2013 now finds herself working three jobs in 
different industries, including cleaning the roads for Chennai 
Corporation.  Srinivasan’s younger brother is Danabal, a 6-year-old is 
in 1<sup>st</sup> grade. The youngest child, Jenifer, is 5 years old.  
She is also deaf &amp; mute and will begin school this year. 
Additionally, this family has more dependents which include both 
Srinivasan’s grandmothers and his distant cousin, Yamini, 6, whose parents committed suicide due to financial problems.</p>

<p>
<b>Bala Murugan: </b></p>
<p>
An
 independent filmmaker from Madurai, Bala has worked as an Assistant 
Director and cameraman in several Tamil short and feature films.</p>
<p>
His
 passion for movie making and unfading love towards children has brought
 him closer to this project. He hopes to bring the best out of the kids 
so that some day when they grow up, they can look back and draw 
inspiration from the wonders they created under his tutelage. He is 
currently working as an assistant with Arun Arumugam (see below) on a 
bi-lingual Tamil/English feature film.</p>
<p>
<b>Arun Arumugam:</b></p>
<p>
With
 more than 12 years of experience as an Associate Director in the Tamil 
Film industry, Arun brings a myriad of talents to the table. He started 
his career as an AD for renowned directors like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandiraj"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Pandiaraj</span></a> &amp; <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikraman"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Vikraman</a> and went on to co-direct a few feature films.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Michael. I am a 21 year old student from Cape Town, South Africa. In December 2011 I travelled for an AIESEC international internship to Hyderabad in India where I spent two months living and working in a children's home called Courtesy Foundation.</p>
<p>During this time I became like a big brother to the sixty children living in the home, I had the most amazing time of my life. The children have very little, their clothes are often tearing and they don't all have shoes, but they are full of joy and love and taught me an important lesson about life.</p>
<p>Throughout the two months, together with a few Brazilian and an Egyptian intern, we would eat every meal sitting with the kids, making sure not to elevate ourselves from them in any way, we bought them cookies and gifts, celebrated Christmas with them and flew kites for Sankranti (Indian harvest festival in January) and stood and saluted the Indian flag with them during the national anthem on Republic Day.</p>
<p>These kids love going to school, the home has its own small English language school on a plot next door, and you will never hear them say anything bad about their school day, though they get upset if they don't finish their homework on time.</p>
<p>I have been back to visit them once already in June 2012 when I surprised them and spent a further three weeks with them. I have fallen utterly and completely in love and not a day goes by that I don't miss the hugs from Kumar or Balu's smile or the great food.</p>
<p>When I went in June I brought them t-shirts which friends and family helped pay for. Now in January I've decided I want to make a bigger and longer lasting contribution to their lives. I want them to have books to read, reading was something I have always enjoyed and something I attribute a lot of my learning to rather than school, and its important for children to read so that they develop their language proficiency. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Books in India, thankfully, are affordable. If you've ever wanted to pig out on a bunch of Stephen King's India is the place for you. I am trying to raise a mere $500 which may not seem like much, but in India this is equivalent to 25,000 rupees. With a children's book selling for an average of 300 rupees in a retail book store this would be enough to purchase 70 books and have 4000 rupees to spare for some shelving etc.</p>
<p>Now consider that I am planning to negotiate with book shops and possibly buy some second-hand books as well I am hoping this amount will be enough to get 100-150 books for the 60 kids at the home. This way every kid will always have a book to read and another to choose from without them having to fight and they will have enough books to last them a year or two considering a distribution for age group and language (their native tongue is Telugu, however they also learn Hindi and English in school).</p>
<p>The kids are aged 4 - 14 and mostly are in classes from Lower Kindergarten (LKG, age 4) to 4th class (age 10). So a variety from picture books to more elaborate children's books would be needed.</p>
<p>What do you get? Well, this isn't a commercial enterprise and no one is making a profit out of it or producing a good. So I can't offer to send you a product or anything of that sort.</p>
<p>However, you will get the great satisfaction of having made a tangible impact on 60 childrens' lives (not an anonymous donation that disappears in the depths of a multi-national NGO).</p>
<p>I will also share photos of the books, the book shelves and the kids reading and depending on your contribution will send you a printed photo with a thank you note on the pack. If you're erally generous I might even ask one of the kids to write you a letter ;).</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>These 60 children come from diverse family backgrounds. Some are HIV orphans and suffering of HIV and AIDS themselves (a few in the final stages of the disease). Others are orphans or semi-orphans and others have been taken away from their families or the families can't take care of them any longer.</p>
<p>The home is a tiny organisation, started with just a few kids. They have an office with a few staff doing all the fundraising, but the magic happens at the home on the outskirts of Hyderabad. The manager has a wife, three kids and his mother to take care of, yet earns a salary of abour $120 and will still gladly spend his money on a birthday cake for one of the kids. </p>
<p>He spends most nights away from his family to stay at the home and is the most gentle, loving and caring man I have ever met and I can truly say that he is a great friend of mine.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Hi, my name is Michael. I am a 21 year old student from Cape Town, South Africa. In December 2011 I travelled for an AIESEC international internship to Hyderabad in India where I spent two months living and working in a children's home called Courtesy Foundation.
During this time I became like a big brother to the sixty children living in the home, I had the most amazing time of my life. The children have very little, their clothes are often tearing and they don't all have shoes, but they are full of joy and love and taught me an important lesson about life.
Throughout the two months, together with a few Brazilian and an Egyptian intern, we would eat every meal sitting with the kids, making sure not to elevate ourselves from them in any way, we bought them cookies and gifts, celebrated Christmas with them and flew kites for Sankranti (Indian harvest festival in January) and stood and saluted the Indian flag with them during the national anthem on Republic Day.
These kids love going to school, the home has its own small English language school on a plot next door, and you will never hear them say anything bad about their school day, though they get upset if they don't finish their homework on time.
I have been back to visit them once already in June 2012 when I surprised them and spent a further three weeks with them. I have fallen utterly and completely in love and not a day goes by that I don't miss the hugs from Kumar or Balu's smile or the great food.
When I went in June I brought them t-shirts which friends and family helped pay for. Now in January I've decided I want to make a bigger and longer lasting contribution to their lives. I want them to have books to read, reading was something I have always enjoyed and something I attribute a lot of my learning to rather than school, and its important for children to read so that they develop their language proficiency. 


What We Need & What You Get
Books in India, thankfully, are affordable. If you've ever wanted to pig out on a bunch of Stephen King's India is the place for you. I am trying to raise a mere $500 which may not seem like much, but in India this is equivalent to 25,000 rupees. With a children's book selling for an average of 300 rupees in a retail book store this would be enough to purchase 70 books and have 4000 rupees to spare for some shelving etc.
Now consider that I am planning to negotiate with book shops and possibly buy some second-hand books as well I am hoping this amount will be enough to get 100-150 books for the 60 kids at the home. This way every kid will always have a book to read and another to choose from without them having to fight and they will have enough books to last them a year or two considering a distribution for age group and language (their native tongue is Telugu, however they also learn Hindi and English in school).
The kids are aged 4 - 14 and mostly are in classes from Lower Kindergarten (LKG, age 4) to 4th class (age 10). So a variety from picture books to more elaborate children's books would be needed.
What do you get? Well, this isn't a commercial enterprise and no one is making a profit out of it or producing a good. So I can't offer to send you a product or anything of that sort.
However, you will get the great satisfaction of having made a tangible impact on 60 childrens' lives (not an anonymous donation that disappears in the depths of a multi-national NGO).
I will also share photos of the books, the book shelves and the kids reading and depending on your contribution will send you a printed photo with a thank you note on the pack. If you're erally generous I might even ask one of the kids to write you a letter ;).


The Impact
These 60 children come from diverse family backgrounds. Some are HIV orphans and suffering of HIV and AIDS themselves (a few in the final stages of the disease). Others are orphans or semi-orphans and others have been taken away from their families or the families can't take care of them any longer.
The home is a tiny organisation, started with just a few kids. They have an office with a few staff doing all the fundraising, but the magic happens at the home on the outskirts of Hyderabad. The manager has a wife, three kids and his mother to take care of, yet earns a salary of abour $120 and will still gladly spend his money on a birthday cake for one of the kids. 
He spends most nights away from his family to stay at the home and is the most gentle, loving and caring man I have ever met and I can truly say that he is a great friend of mine.
The kids, though they have little, are incredibly joyous and always happy. They most amazing thing is seeing the shine in their eyes when a visitor comes and no matter how small a donor's contribution they will all crowd around the entrance of the home as the donor leaves and shout bye and think you.
I have never met such well behaved and truly ""good"" children. However, though they learn English and Hindi in school their skill, especially in English, is lacking. They don't have anyone to speak English to and no books to practice with.
With the organisation struggling to meet their overheads every month to keep the children fed and warm and the teachers paid I want to help out with these books to give the kids a better chance at a good education and a better life when they grow up, because if anyone deserves it, they do.


Other Ways You Can Help
Other ways to help? Sure, you can collect books with friends and family and send them to the home itself! This would be after I've established the basic library and would be a great way to extend it further.
If you're in Hyderabad you should also come visit sometime during January when I am there and feel free to bring books, toys, food, clothes etc. or just bring some friends and some music and play with the kids for an afternoon!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>My dream is to empower the youth by encouraging true bravery through the understanding of the self and subsequent realization of children’s own unique potential. My goal is to integrate self-development and dignity courses into our educational system, establishing critical life skills and techniques for children to acknowledge themselves and their peers as worthy individuals.</p>
<p>There seems to be an underlying but recurrent belief in our society of human inadequacy, whether it not being eligible for a university degree, taking a leadership position or simply being a good enough mother. This belief is cemented in children’s education very early on and leads to anxiety, stress and fear, as they get older. Thus, I think it is fundamental to make a positive impact in the world, starting with people in a young age to create a stronger change in the future and it is to accomplish this purpose that I gratefully receive donations.</p>
<p>To achieve this goal I will enroll a graduate education at Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado by the end of August 2013. I plan to dedicate the next three years in studying and practicing somatic psychology.</p>

<p>Throughout my life I dealt with questions about being different from others, not only in my opinions but also in my way of looking and everything else that comes along with simply just “being”. </p>
<p>Growing up in a Comorian* and Danish home and with an international education, I am accustomed to being surrounded by different cultures and languages both at my workplace, in my spare time, and while studying.</p>
<p>I have a strong interest in people and their personal development and therefore I have chosen to take my master's in psychology at this particular university that has a strong focus on the student’s personal growth to become a practicing psychologist.</p>

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>Auburn University Students for Life is the pro-life and human rights organization on Auburn's campus. We strive to make campus friendly to mothers and help those in need around Auburn and Opelika. We do so by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Running diaper drives to raise money to buy supplies for women's shelters.</li>
<li>Assist in any capacity with the founding of a non-profit home for student mothers.</li>
<li>Spread information about resources for those with an unexpected pregnancy.</li>
<li>Create a positive and pro-woman environment at Auburn University.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>While we stay active on Auburn's campus, we're raising money to attend the March For Life in Washington D.C. This is what your donations will go to:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are raising money to bring 50 students from Auburn University and the University of Alabama at Birmingham to Washington D.C. We are planning on flying from Atlanta on January 20, 2014 and returning on Jan. 22, immediately following the March for Life. While in D.C., we will attend the annual Students for Life of America Conference, take part in the March for Life and possibly other related events.</li>
<li>Helping AUSFL does more than make you feel warm and fuzzy inside - we will give  signed cards with pictures of all participants at the march to all donors, club sweatshirts to those who donate over $75, and we will put the names of donors of more than $150 on the back of the club sweatshirts.</li>
<li>If we don't reach our goal, we will still put the money towards the trip. However, not reaching our goal will mean students will have to pay nearly $300 to attend the trip, and the number of those going will significantly decrease.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Attending the March for Life will do more than give these college students a trip to the capital. These are other benefits from our pilgrimage</p>
<ul>
<li>Students who attend the annual SFL conference and march for life will meet pro-life people their age from around the country - a rarity for our movement</li>
<li>Attending the March for Life and SFL conference is an amazing opportunity for students to stand up for what they believe in.</li>
<li>This trip isn't a vacation - it's educational. We become inspired and get new ideas on how to bring the pro-life mission home.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Pioneer Project is a program designed for students who want to spend a semester immersed in homesteading, traditional crafts, and wilderness adventure.  It is designed for purpose-seeking students who'd like to become active community members and empowered self-starters.  It is designed to remind people of the deep confidence that grows from a foundation of self sufficiency; the deep inner and outer awareness that stems from a connection to the natural world; and the fulfillment that comes from the patient creation of crafts with one's own hands.  It is an experimental mixture of progressive education, eastern philosophy, back-to-the-land idealism, fine craft, and outdoor adventure.  It is intent on spurring growth and transformation in each student, and by extension, contributing to a more sustainable, aware, and enthusiastic society.  It is our 10-year dream that has been evolving and coming into focus (Read more at our <a href=""http://www.pioneerproject.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""website"">website</a>).</p>
<p>Our dream is well on its way to manifesting.  We have students enrolled, a campus to host them, and a wonderful crafting community to introduce them to - not to mention some fine wilderness right at our doorstep.  Indeed, the stars are aligning here in this enchanted valley in Brasstown, North Carolina to make our dreams a reality.</p>
<p>We are two months away from its launch in September 2013.  Whoa!  We have spent much of the last 10 years preparing for this moment in direct and indirect ways.  As a couple, we have worked and volunteered with more than 15 educational organizations and are intent on applying our experience to create a powerful program (read our bios <a href=""http://www.pioneerproject.org/#!staff/c18rg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>).  This project will be the culmination of hundreds of hours of dreaming, planning, recruiting, studying, and believing in dreams coming true. The Pioneer Project is woven from our inner fibers that emerges from the intersection of what we love to do and how we believe we can contribute to a better society.  It is at that intersection that the magic seems to happen - where the universe conspires on your behalf so that you may find support to fulfill your purpose.  We are seeking that support here on Indiegogo. </p>
<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p>So what do we want from you?  Well, we are seeking funds to purchase a small inventory of outdoor equipment to outfit our wilderness expeditions.  The wilderness component of our program is integral to helping our students forge a deep connection to the natural world, reflect on their purpose, learn to live simply, conquer challenges as a team and push their comfort zones.  It is also the component with very high startup costs, which is why we'd love your help!  Below is our list of items needed and price estimates from various gear shops. </p>

<p><strong>A note on our funding goal</strong></p>
<p>Although our grand total is $8,280,we recognize it is a lot! So, we have set a lower, more realistic goal of $3500. This will still allow us to purchase priority items first (camping gear), then paddling gear, then climbing gear, so that we can establish a full inventory of one department at a time. This will allow less reliance on outfitters all around.</p>
<p>We are also keeping the campaign goal low because Indiegogo takes a higher cut if the goal is not reached.  So despite setting a lower goal, we would still love to raise the grand total if we're able to!<strong> <br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>What's in it for you?  Our PERKS!</strong></p>

<p>We're also including some of the bigger, more adventurous endeavours we offer, so you can get a taste of what the region offers and how we use it to help our students reach their fullest potential.  You, too, can feel the excitement of embarking on an adventure you might not have thought you'd do and feel the sense of accomplishment after putting in a couple miles on a mountain trail to take in amazing views, or from a day of paddling and facing your fear about white water.  Alternatively, you can take in the peacefulness of the humble homestead as you learn a craft and enjoy a home-cooked meal. </p>
<p>Redeeming these perks can happen within a one year period.  We have a busy Fall ahead, so it may be Spring before we can redeem.</p>

<p>We need your help! Over 5 million Americans currently have Alzheimer's and that number is expected to TRIPLE by 2050.

That is why we have developed a plan to distribute the film “I Remember Better When I Paint” on a broad nationwide basis. For the film is not just another story; it is a powerful case study, showing how life can take on new meanings despite the impact of memory impairment.<br/><br/>“I Remember Better When I Paint” was inspired by the true life stories of people who experienced the renewing power of creative engagement.  One such person was the artist Hilgos, who, after being afflicted, became very reclusive, withdrawing from almost all social interactions. As the disease took hold, it became increasingly difficult to connect with Hilgos, even for her own daughter, the film’s co-director.<br/><br/>But, this is a heartwarming story, as her daughter was able to see a pathway to connect with her mother again. On one particular visit, she was having a very difficult time communicating with her mother. In an effort to find anything that would reach her, she asked: “Mother, do you want to paint?” And, to her amazement, Hilgos responded, “Yes, I Remember Better When I Paint.” These words were the catalyst for the film and book of the same name.<br/><br/>The film takes us through her journey as she picks up a brush, begins to paint again—and recovers a sense of identity and fulfillment.<br/><br/>I Remember Better When I Paint, narrated by Olivia de Havilland, is the first international documentary about the positive impact of art and other creative therapies on people and how these approaches can change the way we look at Alzheimer's. Among those who are featured are noted doctors and Yasmin Aga Khan, president of Alzheimer’s Disease International and daughter of Rita Hayworth, who had Alzheimer’s and also painted.<br/></p>
<p>We have shared the film through community screenings at the Metropolitan Museum in New York, The School of the Art Institute of Chicago, The Phillips Collection in Washington, DC, medical schools and in foreign venues from Paris to Dublin to Hong Kong. The film has also been broadcast on television in local markets including New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC.

The film ""shows a new pathway for engaging with a loved one you thought was lost..."" comments Gail Sheehy, renowned author and journalist. Yes, the feedback has been wonderful.

<h3>So what is all of this?</h3>
<p>First off; HELLO, I AM GRIMALKIN. From the Atheism+ forums. I am going to Skepticon 6- a huge and awesome Skeptical/Atheist convetion- but there is a problem; Not absolutely everyone in the forums (and the rest of A+...) gets to go to Skepticon because, while Skepticon is free, planes and hotels and all of that is not. This simply will not do. I would fix it, but I don't have unlimited money. However, my sources tell me that YOU, internet, do have unlimited money somehow. Or perhaps a finite amount of money but a little bit to spare. Would you perhaps give a little so we can have travel and hotel grants for A+ people who want to go but can't because of money?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What we need:</h3>
<p>While it changes from place to place, a safe number for what it costs to get to Skepticon from within the continental US is around $700, for a roughly $300 flight and a 4 night stay at the reduced hotel rate. While we'll give each grant receiver exactly what they need, $700 is our base goal to fund at least one generic person (but hopefully we go over!). We will ensure that the money is used properly, either through buying the tickets/booking rooms on their behalf, or better solutions should they arise.</p>
<p>Of course, there's always the sad chance that we don't hit our goal... or the chance that we hit out goal SO WELL that we have more money than we need to fund people. In both of those scenarios, the money will be donated to Skepticon.</p>

<p>Besides the knowledge that you made an already awesome convention that much more awesome, we also have perks courtesy of our more creative A+ members. They're varied, some are cool, and some are silly (most of mine are silly) but hopefully they sweeten the deal a little.</p>

<p>Hi, my name is Jason He, a <strong>typical Asian </strong>guy. Albeit a generalization, it pretty much boils down to the fact that I follow instructions well. Life to date for me can be simply condensed into uncomplicated stages: I immigrated to the US as a kid, studied hard in school, attended a good liberal arts college on a full-tuition scholarship, then studied some more. After graduation, I followed an equally standard career track - first in consulting, then banking, and finally at a hedge fund. Yet gradually, I woke up to the realization that life has got to be more than following everyone else’s expectations. I’d never taken a stand on anything. Do I have what it takes to stand on my own two feet? Can I <strong>create</strong> something? But what?</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 90px;"">      <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQm6IIjxRU_t37A20vZNxUUqJoXMUoH-SDaZ1y57hdIVkK4UNFh"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The answer to what I was looking for came shortly after my <strong>son </strong>was born. Reflecting on my own path, the one thing that stood out was the <strong>power </strong>of<strong> language</strong>. This power shaped my surroundings and made me the person I am today. So naturally I wanted my son to learn his mother tongue, Mandarin Chinese. After sifting through a slew of <strong>antiquated</strong> learning materials and worst of all, <strong>gimmicks</strong>, I was disappointed, but excited. I was excited that there may be something I could do to make a difference.</p>
<p>I began reading anything and everything I could find on Chinese and language learning. The deeper I dug, the clearer it became that this sleepy field needs a serious makeover. Having worked in stressful industries, I am a firm believer of <strong>productivity hacking</strong> – exploiting ways to achieve more with less. The more I dissembled and understood the inner workings of Chinese, the more I realized that simply by adopting a <strong>rational</strong> and <strong>sensible</strong> learning approach and marrying the principles of <strong>time management</strong> with <strong>cognitive best practices</strong>, it was entirely possible to anyone to GET this seemingly difficult language. Little by little, I pieced together the framework for a <strong>holistic</strong> <strong>approach</strong> to hacking Chinese. After speaking and confirming with friends and language enthusiasts, I knew I had something of value.  It’s a road not taken, but one thing I was certain was that it would be a <strong>shorter path</strong>.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 90px;"">   <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRlM1SYSu2vnPGkR0UQFEy1xka3wNkSAPLmxk2HUR78YGuNf2wcag"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2><strong>Just An Average Guy Who Refuses to Believe in the Status Quo<br/></strong></h2>
<p>I'm not a linguist. And initially my knowledge of Chinese was only confined to having grown up with the language. But for what I'm not, I make it up for being a pragmatist with a passion for <strong>pushing boundaries</strong>. My time spent following polymaths and my training in finance have taught me one thing, and that is to really <em>get </em>something, question everything and be sensible. Applied to learning, this means investing effort to master the principles and drivers which in turn generate the <strong>greatest return</strong>. Unfortunately, much of the existing materials direct a learner’s efforts on acquiring the <em>what</em> (typically through sheer <strong>rote memorization</strong>), without realizing that <strong>the <em>what</em> is simply a byproduct of the <em>how</em></strong>. A learner not taught the how and cannot see the big picture is like a traveler who has lost <strong>sight</strong>. In the journey to conquer a new language, what are the chances for the blind person to successfully make it across to the other side? Fortunately, there are sound principles that anyone can follow. I highlight four below that are cornerstones of Serika. These guiding stars can give ""sight"" to the learner so he/she is able to confidently walk the shortest path to the destination:</p>
<p><strong>Deconstruction</strong> – <em>dissemble Chinese into its <strong>core functional parts</strong>, then trim every part to its <strong>essence</strong> and eliminate anything that adds <strong>unnecessary complexity</strong></em>. <em>Learn only what you will use.</em> Unfortunately, this deconstruction process is missing in many of the existing materials which indiscriminately overload one with aspects of the language without giving consideration to its <strong>utility</strong>. Learning tones in Chinese is very important, but learning <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">marking rules</span> for tones returns zero practical value. Likewise, learning Pinyin facilitates character acquisition but memorizing obscure Pinyin rules does not. Similarly, character acquisition should focus on achieving comprehension, not in reproducing characters by hand (at least not initially), which unnecessarily taxes one’s mental capacity that can be better used for acquiring a larger vocabulary bank to aid in conversational fluency. In short, <strong>unselective learning</strong> curricula dilute a learner’s ROI on time and money invested and at worst can outright take a learner down the wrong path.</p>
<p><strong>Controlled Sequencing - </strong><em>purposely<strong> prioritize</strong> the core material in an optimal sequence to facilitate learning in a natural, sensible order</em>.  Chinese is a <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">tonal language</span>, which is often challenging for first-time learners. As a result, tone should be the first point of contact in learning Chinese. <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Grammar</span> on the other hand, is the <strong>natural flow</strong> of the language. Therefore, it should never be <strong>memorized</strong> but rather exposed in its natural setting only when one has reached the stage of sentence production. In addition, Chinese grammar is relatively simple in construct (e.g. lack of inflections, Subject-Verb-Object sentence structure) but is complicated by nuances in word order, aspects, etc. A learner under traditional methodologies would spend considerable time memorizing the various nuances in Chinese grammar without regard for practical ROI. The more effective order of learning grammar should be tiered on its utility insofar as facilitating sentence production. Exposure to the more nuanced grammar topics should be held back and <em>released</em> purposely after one is comfortable in handling the most frequent conversational topics. Sequencing learning curricula this way ensures that 1). The learner gains <strong>progression</strong> naturally in pace with his or her’s overall capabilities, and 2). complexities do not prematurely distract a learner’s attention from acquiring skills of immediate utility.</p>
<p><strong>Power Functional Characters – <em>stacking</em></strong><em> is a powerful linguistic mechanism in Chinese that aids in the formation of characters and words in an intuitive manner</em>.  A learner can achieve the greatest results by focusing effort to learn how this formation mechanism works and also by learning the most <strong>frequently used functional characters</strong>, which together make up a useful majority of the modern Chinese vocabulary bank. It follows that further enhancement of character acquisition can be achieved by optimally exposing a learner to “new” characters that are either combinations or derivatives of more basic components that a learner is <strong>already familiar</strong> with so as to minimize the cognitive load required to learn any “new” character.</p>
<p><strong>Web Interactivity – </strong>an interactive web system can provide a <strong>multi-sensory</strong> learning environment that can supercharge the overall learning experience. The effectiveness of such concepts has been documented in many scientific studies. By combining the content with an effective <strong>visual layout</strong>, <strong>intelligent customization</strong> and <strong>gamification </strong>techniques and <strong>social</strong> features, a web-based platform provides a holistic learning experience that is greater than sum of any of the individual learning components. More importantly, interactive features can introduce <strong>stake</strong>, which motivates learners and help stimulate and maintain a high interest level throughout the course.</p>
<p>Simply stated, the end goal should be to make sure that every second of a learner’s time is spent efficiently on material that is effective.</p>

<h2><strong>I Need Your Help</strong></h2>
<p>Have you always wanted to pick up Chinese but never had the time? Are you afraid that you cannot learn it? Are you currently studying Chinese but are frustrated by the material or lack of progress? Do you want to impress natives by knowing even what they may not know about Chinese? I believe Serika can get you to your destination. But first, I need your help.</p>
<p>I have spent hours creating the content from scratch. I’ve also hired a web developer to build the web platform. But to get the entire system to its full functional form, I need additional funding for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Retain a professional web development team to code the full set of customized back-end web applications, including an intelligent test engine, flash card system, dash board, and a multitude of community and social functions and features</li>
<li>Hire designers to create a suite of visual layouts to enhance the look and feel of the content delivery system. This is because I firmly believe that elegant and effective visual presentation can make or break the learning experience</li>
<li>Retain hands to turn fun and interesting contents available on the web into fresh and engaging Chinese learning materials</li>
</ul><p>How great I can make the final system depends on how much funding I can raise. With your help, I will have the best shot at creating a fully functional system that delivers the best learning experience and results.</p>
<p>Even if you cannot contribute, I would be more than grateful if you can help spread the word on Facebook, Twitter, or simply tell anyone that you think might be interested or can benefit from this project. Thank you!</p>

<p><b>What PEF Needs:</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>      The funds that the PEF uses to
provide grants and awards comes from a number of sources.  Some of
our more significant sources include our TOPS gift card program,
private donations, our Celebration Circle program and our two annual
fund raisers:  the Lizzard Ball (in the spring) and June &amp;
Roger's annual Labor Sunday Potluck Party (in late summer).  Because
we were unable to organize a Lizzard Ball in the spring of 2013 we
find ourselves needing to augment our summer fund raising efforts in
the hopes of making up the difference in time for the 2014 grant
review process.  It is our hope that we can raise substantially more
than our $800 target.  If we fail to meet our target then some
local ideas and projects will likely go unfunded and we would likely have to
refuse more project than we accept for the first time in our decade
of service. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Not able to contribute money?  Maybe you can contribute your time.  The Peace Education Fund board nedds to fill out a few more spots.  If you would be able to make it to 12 to 20 meetings a year (usually on the second Mondays of the month in the early afternoon) please send an email to JuneLicence@fundpeace.org .</p>

<p><b>Please Note: </b></p>
<p>The Riverside-Salem UCC church processes financial transactions for the Peace Education Fund.  When you make a financial contribution the recipient will appear as ""New York Conference of the United Church of Christ"" but your contribution will actually go to the Peace Education Fund.<br/></p>

<p><strong>My Story: </strong></p>
<p>Hello all. I am young 22 year old and recent graduate with a passion for cultural diversity, education, bettering the lives of children, and giving back to the world in any way that I can. I've recently decided to spend the youth of my 20's pursuing my passions by teaching English abroad in an effort to enrich the lives of young ones while simultaneously broadening my own horizons. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What are you supporting?</strong></p>
<p>I will be taking off to Thailand in September for at least six months, if not longer, and I am looking for your support in my journey over to the beautiful land of smiles. I'm going with the TEFL Heaven group to teach English to Thai children of all ages. </p>
<p>The donations will support my TEFL qualification, as well as, the travels and expenses to get myself there. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p>English is not an easy language to learn - especially in those areas of the world, such as Thailand, that have limited resources. Sometimes the hardest places to reach out too are the ones that need the most help. This is why I chose Thailand to go teach English and be a helpful resource to their young students. </p>
<p>I've been blessed with the opportunity to teach and live in Thailand, work with children and fully emerse myself into a completely different culture. I cannot think of a better way to spend the next 6 months, or even a year, other than spreading my knowledge and helping the young students of Thailand overcome this language barrier. </p>
<p>I am taking a giant leap of faith by going on this journey, but am chasing my dreams and trusting my intuition that this is where I should be. Any donation is much appreciated and promised to be used in good faith. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thanks for reading and thank you for your donation. </p>

<p>In November I received word that I had been accepted into the Social Responsibility and Personal Well-being course at the University of Mount Union.</p>
<p>This semester I’ve been learning about our world and how to improve it. Already we’ve learned about sustainability, global warming, social justice, and so much more! I’m grateful for this opportunity to be in a class with other people who are interested in improving the world. </p>
<p>This class also includes a service trip over Spring Break. Originally we were going to go to El Salvador, but due to travel warnings we are now going to the Dominican Republic. </p>
<p>In the Dominican Republic, I will be working with West Indies Christian Ministries. I’ll be painting and doing construction on their school, and I will get to work with kids all week. It will be such an incredible experience and I am so excited to go!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 class=""H3""><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h2>
<p>In order to go on this trip, I need to raise funds. I thought I would try a different approach-- an online campaign.  Here’s where the money is going:</p>
<ul>
<li>Airfare</li>
<li>Room and board</li>
<li>Food for the week</li>
<li>Transportation</li>
<li>Supplies for construction/painting</li>

<li>Donations of $5 or more will receive a shout out on my Facebook page and a signed photograph of everyone on the trip.</li>
<li>Donations of $25 or over will receive the above, and a small souvenir from the Dominican Republic.</li>
<li>Donations of $75 or over will receive the above and a piece of amber jewelry, a stone abundant in the Dominican Republic.</li>
</ul><p>If you can’t give monetarily, please help me spread the word by passing this along via email and to your Facebook friends.</p>

<h2 class=""H3""><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
<p>I’m really looking forward to this trip. It’s going to have a huge impact on the children we’re going there to see. I will be stuffing my suitcase full of food, toys and clothes to leave behind when I come back to the U.S. I’m also learning Spanish songs and learning games to share. I cannot express in words how excited I am to spend a week with these kids.</p>
<p>I’ve always loved service trips, but I know that this one will be something special. This is my very first out-of-country service trip. I’m excited to learn about a new culture, to learn more Spanish, and to come out of this trip with more life lessons.</p>

Our Story

Hi,

 
Our Names are Kimberli Resinos and Janey Paredes.  We are sophomores at James Monroe High School who believe
in our community.

We have worked hard to maintain excellent grades and were
recently honored with receiving the American Youth Foundation’s National
Leadership Award.  We have a strong
desire to become leaders to help our community and need your help.
We are looking for sponsors to help us achieve our goal of raising $2270 so
that we can attend The American Youth Foundation’s National Leadership
Conference that takes place in Michigan, this August (5th-12th).  The cost of the conference
is $610/person, the plane tickets are $425/person and camping supplies are
about $100/person.
We are looking for any amount, large or small to help us achieve our goal.  If you contribute, we will keep you informed
of our experience at the conference.
We can’t wait to be the change we wish to see in our community!  Thank you for taking the time to hear our
story.


The Impact
We want to realize our leadership potential and explore new things to bring back to our school and community.


What We Need & What You Get
We have reserved our spots in the NLC and airlines on credit, but our families cannot afford to pay it back.  We know we can raise enough money to not burden our families with the cost of our high aspirations.  We cannot wait to show people what progress we have made!

<p><span><strong>Keep in Touch</strong></span></p>
<p><span>We believe, that address books should be about relations instead of just numbers and letters. We change our phone numbers, photos, job titles and e-mails on a regular basis throughout life, but we still remain the same person with an ever-expanding network of relations that needs to be held up-to-date. Therefore address books should help us to keep in touch with friends, family and colleagues as years pass by in the ever-changing world of late modern society.</span></p>

We believe, that address books should be about relations instead of just numbers and letters. We change our phone numbers, photos, job titles and e-mails on a regular basis throughout life, but we still remain the same person with an ever-expanding network of relations that needs to be held up-to-date. Therefore address books should help us to keep in touch with friends, family and colleagues as years pass by in the ever-changing world of late modern society.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p><span class=""agText"">The North Oldham High School Speech Team (which was founded in 2003 when the school opened) has had its MOST SUCCESSFUL SEASON YET!  We have grown from 3 members back in 2003 to 32 members this year (check out our page on Facebook to see pictures of the team members and notes on our competition season - the page is listed under 2010-2011 North Oldham High School Speech Team).  </span></p>
<p><br/><span class=""agText""></span></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><span class=""agText"">And to think it all started in 2003 with a trio of students riding to a competition in a mini-van!  My, how we have grown!</span></p>
<p><br/><span class=""agText""></span></p>
<p><span class=""agText"">We have traveled to many tournaments across the state this year and have placed in the top overall sweepstakes category at nearly every competition.  We have had high numbers of finalists each time and many repeat champions!  This year, we are proud to have 5 
NOHS students to represent our school and the KCFL state speech league at the National Grand Tournament in Washington, DC this coming Memorial Day weekend! <br/></span></p>
<p><span class=""agText""><br/></span></p>
<p><span class=""agText"">The students work throughout the year to raise money for the team.  Because we don't receive any funding whatsoever, we must work constantly to raise funds for competition fees, transportation, scripts and supplies, etc.  We produce drama productions, sell cookies, sell poinsettias, work concessions stands,, etc. And since we have 32 students on the team, our monetary needs have essentially doubled this year.  These students are continuing to do what they can when it comes to our cookie sales and productions, but we REALLY need your help to not only get these FIVE students to nationals, but also to get a head-start on our budget for next year.  We anticipate having 35 students on the team next year, so please do your part to help these students!</span></p>
<p><br/><span class=""agText""></span></p>
<p><span class=""agText"">We are currently the <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">NUMBER ONE</span> team in our county, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">NUMBER TWO</span> in our region, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">NUMBER FOUR</span> with the KCFL state speech league, and <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">NUMBER SIX</span> in the state for the Kentucky HS Speech League!  <br/></span></p>
<p><span class=""agText""><br/></span></p>
<p><span class=""agText"">That's why we need YOUR HELP!  We are asking that you please donate to our cause--get these 5 students to nationals and also help us with next year's needs!  We are a small school and it is difficult to find sponsorships for our students--and they deserve this honor without having to worry about the money issue.</span></p>
<p><br/><span class=""agText""></span></p>
<p><span class=""agText"">In short, we would be honored if you could donate and help these talented, honorable, sweet, wonderful students to be the best they can be--especially on the national level!  We will always make you proud!</span></p>
<p><br/><span class=""agText""></span></p>
<p><span class=""agText"">SPECIAL NOTE:  If you are an alumni member of a speech team, then you especially know the importance of keeping our funds up for the season!  I am hoping that my former team members (from both BGHS AND NOHS) will help us for sure!<br/></span></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><span class=""agText"">I believe in the importance of competitive speech activities.  I fell in love with the activity when I was in the 6th grade.  I went on to compete on the middle school, high school, and college levels.  And I have been coaching speech teams since 1999.  From my wonderful students at Bowling Green High School to my most recent speech team kiddos at North Oldham High School, I consider it an HONOR to be a part of these students' lives.  <br/></span></p>
<p><span class=""agText""><br/></span></p>
<p><span class=""agText"">Being a part of the speech team is not just about competition--sure, the trophies are nice to have, but it teaches so many other positive things.  I can honestly say that the speech team community is a family.   And once you become a part of that activity, you have lifelong family members that support, love, and keep you in their hearts.  Speech also does SO MUCH for a person's confidence.  Many of us who now are coaches were speech team members in middle and high school in our home towns.  Some of us even competed on the college level.  Once you are a part of the speech team community, you never truly leave it.  The confidence you receive from being a part of speech is a major factor.  You use the public speaking skills forever in both your personal and career paths.  And we have all different types of students in this activity--that's the beauty of it.  It is an accepting, warm, and special team to be a part of for the rest of your life.  <br/></span></p>
<p><br/><span class=""agText""></span></p>
<p><span class=""agText"">Most of our students go on to college and pursue majors in everything from communications to teaching to engineering to nursing.  They go to college with confidence and determination.  And after having spent thousands of hours preparing and competing in the speech world, they know that the speech world has better prepared them for the real world.  We are proud that our students are Rhodes Scholars, Governor's School for the Arts students, Governor's Scholars, National Merit Scholars, and Gold Key Art students.   And, of course, regional and state champs--and now headed for nationals!  We are proud that we have had students compete on the national level every year since 2003.  We have had team members reach the semi-final round of competition on the national level--always a feat!</span></p>
<p><br/><span class=""agText""></span></p>
<p><span class=""agText"">Our students compete in 12 various events--and many of them are triple or quadruple entered at each tournament!  All while maintaining their GPA status and other commitments!<br/></span></p>
<p><span class=""agText""><br/></span></p>
<p><span class=""agText"">As their mentor, I am truly proud that they are kindhearted, caring, giving people who are a joy to coach and call a part of my family!  I can't imagine my life without it.  But we can't do it without your monetary help--so please support us!<br/></span></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get<span class=""agText""><br/></span>
</h3>
<h3><span class=""agText"">The costs of these tournaments include 
travel expenses, entry fees, hotels, and food.  Any leftover monies will be utilized for next year's competition season.  We can certainly go over our requested fundraising amount--and hope we do so!  Every dollar makes a difference!<br/></span></h3>
<h3><span class=""agText"">The $2500 we are asking 
for would cover the hotel costs and airfare for our 5 students competing at the NCFL Grand Nationals Tournament in Washington, DC May 26-30, 2011.  Washington, DC is an expensive place to visit--and we are not allowed to drive due to school board rules and regulations.  <br/></span></h3>
<h3><span class=""agText"">We would appreciate your help--<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span></span></h3>
<h3><span class=""agText"">And if we happen to raise more than $2500 we will use
 the extra money to offset our upcoming expenses for next year (we typically need up to $7,000 to operate for the year). <br/></span></h3>
<h3>
<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">And now for the perks!  We want to give you a gift for helping out our team!</span><br/>
</h3>
<h3><span class=""agText"">Anyone who donates between $10 and
 $49 will receive a signed photo of our national competitors--so much fun!  We will take the photo in DC and then send it to you upon our return!<br/></span></h3>
<h3><span class=""agText"">Any person who 
donates between $50 and $99 will receive one of our fun NOHS Speech Team t-shirts--signed by the ENTIRE team plus the nationals photo!<br/></span></h3>
<h3><span class=""agText"">Any donor who gives $100 to $299 will receive a special souvenir from our nationals trip (that's right, a little ""thank you"" from our nation's capitol), the signed t-shirt, and signed photo!</span></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">And lastly, any person who donates $300 or more will receive the souvenir, shirt, photo, and a COMPLIMENTARY ONE-HOUR FAMILY PORTRAIT SESSION from Coach Rosemary Cundiff-Brown's photography studio!  Details about the session are available on request--session will be either in-studio or at one local location.  And you may gift the session to someone if you are not local.  Or you can make a trip to Louisville for your session!  <br/><br/>Check out our work at <a href=""http://www.monarch-photography.com/#/family/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Family Portraits"">www.monarch-photography.com</a><br/></span><br/>

<p><strong>Progress</strong></p>
<p>Until launching this crowdfunding campaign on 9th October, I put up a team, a title and a theme and I realized the first <a href=""http://adelinapeltea.com/book-interviews/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">11 interviews</a> on 3 continents and scheduled many more to follow. Already the knowledge gathered is impressive. I will share quotes and previews, but I want to sit and analyze the information, structure it, give it an interesting shape (packing it in a nice art of seduction) and publish it in December this year.</p>

<p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is it about?</strong></p>
<p>The book addresses founders of early stage tech startups  that want to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>how to gather and interpret customer feedback in product development</li>
<li>what it takes to get to product-market fit</li>
<li>how to do user acquisition</li>
<li>how not to scale prematurely</li>
<li>how to use metrics to understand growth potential and to convince investors to fund</li>
<li>how to form a team with the needed skills at different stages of development</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p>Being based on <a href=""http://adelinapeltea.com/book-interviews/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">100+ interviews</a> with entrepreneurs, investors and specialists, the book will provide practical know-how, case studies, recent tools and paths to follow.</p>

<p><strong>How and why would I support you through the making-of?</strong></p>
<p>We launched this crowdfunding campaign and we would be happy to receive support. All of you who believe in our work before the launch and back us up will get mentioned in the book as supporters and will receive different perks. It is nice to see early interest while we work on it.</p>
<p><strong>What is the story behind it?</strong></p>
<p>There are lots of tech startups  that develop a product before checking the market fit, just based on assumptions. You can hear them while pitching that they use words like “I think”, “customers will have to” etc. There are lots of founders that are great technical or business people, but lack marketing knowledge and do not know how to reach potential customers best. There are  all sorts of books but with few practical examples and most of the showcases are only from US and not other areas.</p>
<p>Adelina Peltea, author of the book, realized all these gaps, especially while working on her startup (ytalent). She noticed that the best way to learn is by talking to other founders about deep things that are not disclosed in media stories. Then why not share the learning with other entrepreneurs? Consultancy would be great, but most early stage entrepreneurs would not afford it. Then the idea of publishing a book came along, which would make founders have affordable access to all the knowledge gathered from 100+ interviews. Besides, the revenues from book sales can be used as seed investment in Adelina’s startup, ytalent. That is a way to test if the learning from the book is actually actionable and can lead to success.</p></div>","Prelude
In order to play “the game” and win, the new generation of entrepreneurs needs “coaching“. What if you can have access to advice on building profitable startups from many other entrepreneurs, investors and specialists?
Still, reading theory on how to play doesn’t make you necessarily a good player. You need practice. What if you can see how others do it practically, at different development stages and with different backgrounds?
And also, is not really easy to understand something new, unless you make analogies. What if this new adventure is described to you as a parallel to something you already know very well and you like to do?
If this sounds appealing to you, I invite you to read my upcoming book: Customer Seduction. It will help you build a profitable tech startup by showcasing how other startups seduce(d) their customers.
It will offer you 100+ perspectives of well known entrepreneurs, investors and specialists from various industries and locations. It will be very practical, with plenty of examples, case studies, tools to use, paths to follow.
And it will be easy to follow, being presented as an analogy with the art of seduction (examples: how to build long term relationships with your customer aka retention, how to make customers fall in love at first sight aka design, user experience etc.)

Progress
Until launching this crowdfunding campaign on 9th October, I put up a team, a title and a theme and I realized the first 11 interviews on 3 continents and scheduled many more to follow. Already the knowledge gathered is impressive. I will share quotes and previews, but I want to sit and analyze the information, structure it, give it an interesting shape (packing it in a nice art of seduction) and publish it in December this year.
Until then, it would be great to see your support! Be our ANGELS in this campaign!
Yours truly,
Adelina

 
FAQ
What is it about?
The book addresses founders of early stage tech startups  that want to know:

how to gather and interpret customer feedback in product development
what it takes to get to product-market fit
how to do user acquisition
how not to scale prematurely
how to use metrics to understand growth potential and to convince investors to fund
how to form a team with the needed skills at different stages of development
 
Being based on 100+ interviews with entrepreneurs, investors and specialists, the book will provide practical know-how, case studies, recent tools and paths to follow.
Who is behind the book?

Author: Adelina Peltea 
Project Development: Catalina Dogaru
Community Development: Monica Pascanu 
Product Development: Mihai Zamfir
When and where will it be launched?
Launch is scheduled for 14th December 2012. It will be at first a digital book available at international level.  
Where can I check more details and previews?
An updated list of the work in progress of all the interviews with founders, investors and specialists can be found here. The blog offers details on the making-of (examples: interview stories, previews). A sample interview is available here.
I am an interested future reader. How can I get involved?
We are building a community around the book  that can submit suggestions and give feedback. We will take into consideration different needs you might have and can be covered by the book. So just let us know what you need and want to know. To interact, please join our social networks (facebook and twitter).
How and why would I support you through the making-of?
We launched this crowdfunding campaign and we would be happy to receive support. All of you who believe in our work before the launch and back us up will get mentioned in the book as supporters and will receive different perks. It is nice to see early interest while we work on it.
What is the story behind it?
There are lots of tech startups  that develop a product before checking the market fit, just based on assumptions. You can hear them while pitching that they use words like “I think”, “customers will have to” etc. There are lots of founders that are great technical or business people, but lack marketing knowledge and do not know how to reach potential customers best. There are  all sorts of books but with few practical examples and most of the showcases are only from US and not other areas.
Adelina Peltea, author of the book, realized all these gaps, especially while working on her startup (ytalent). She noticed that the best way to learn is by talking to other founders about deep things that are not disclosed in media stories. Then why not share the learning with other entrepreneurs? Consultancy would be great, but most early stage entrepreneurs would not afford it. Then the idea of publishing a book came along, which would make founders have affordable access to all the knowledge gathered from 100+ interviews. Besides, the revenues from book sales can be used as seed investment in Adelina’s startup, ytalent. That is a way to test if the learning from the book is actually actionable and can lead to success.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Jungle to Jungle makes science exuberant, wild, accessible, and most of all fun! It's ""webducation"" for kids and adults the world over.  Wading in the black waters of the Amazon, petting tapirs and crocodiles, and tromping through the most dangerous and exciting jungles in the world! Sound like a place for middle school students? Not really... which is why we take students on <span style=""font-style: italic;"">virtual </span>field trips to exotic ecosystems around the world. Jungle to Jungle educates young people about the wild places all around them and teaches them to become adept in the latest technology.

<p><br/></p>
<p>Science, tech, and international social skills all taught through the students' very own social networking site.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The program is designed to augment the standard middle school life science classroom curriculum and fulfills and exceeds national and state science education standards.<br/></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>We change the lives of students around the world by connecting them with each other and getting them excited about far off places. In this way, we encourage and educate them to be conscious world citizens.</div>

<div>Students today have so many exciting things going on around them, and we believe that school should be one of them. The education system hasn't changed in 100 years, but everything else has.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p>About a month ago, I released my free Naked Marketing manifesto.</p>
<p><strong>The premise was simple: marketing has gotten too complicated.</strong></p>
<p>All marketing is really about is aligning what you’ve got with what people want and then telling them about it, and used the metaphor of an intimate relationship to explain these steps in simple terms.</p>
<p>The response was overwhelming.</p>
<p>The manifesto has been shared and downloaded THOUSANDS of times, and critically acclaimed by industry thought leaders like Copyblogger Media’s Brian Clark, and Gini Dietrich, recent co-author of the bestselling Marketing in the Round.</p>
<p>Dozens of spin-off resources were created (and have racked up a collected tens of thousands of views themselves!), and there has been an enormous amount of discussion and excitement in the community.</p>
<p>Clearly, I hit a nerve.</p>
<p>Along with all that discussion, there has been an implicit (and sometimes explicit!) interest in learning more – like this response from Mary Jaksch (from Write to Done and A-List Blogging Bootcamps):</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>Oh, my - that manifesto is f%&amp;*)$# hot, Danny!</em></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>The manifesto immediately revealed some fundamental mistakes I'm doing in my marketing ... ouch!</em></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>You're an awesome marketer ... WOW!</em></p>
<p>It quickly became clear to me that the manifesto might have shown them what they were doing WRONG, but it didn’t give them everything that they needed in order to get it RIGHT.</p>
<p>So I finally asked the simple question...</p>
<h3>Does anyone want me to write a book about Naked Marketing?</h3>
<p>First, I asked a few of my colleagues.</p>
<p>Then I reached out to some of my students, and then I asked all of my followers to fill out a survey telling me whether they would be interested in a book that shows, step-by-step, how to do everything that I describe in the Naked Marketing manifesto.</p>
<p>And the answer? It was a resounding YES, YES, YES from all over the world.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">It doesn’t get much clearer than that!</span></p>
<p>Well, if everybody wants me to do this, how could I say no? ;-)</p>
<h3>BUT (the infamous “but” again)...</h3>
<p>I’ve been teaching marketing for a long time, with great results, but this is going to be my first time writing an entire book about the subject.</p>
<p>I’m excited and eager to do it, but I want to make absolutely sure that people actually want to read this book if I write it, and that it will be out-of-this-world AMAZING if I do.</p>
<p>And I’m pretty sure that the way books usually get written, that isn’t going to happen.</p>
<p>Here’s how books usually get written:</p>
<ol>
<li>The author has an idea for a great book, ideally because of a huge groundswell of interest from their community. <strong>(Check)</strong>
</li>
<li>The author goes away to a cabin or something for six months, to write in isolation. <strong>(Errr, not wild about that part)</strong>
</li>
<li>The author publishes the book, which reflects what the author *thought* the community wanted back when he started writing six months earlier. <strong>(That doesn’t sound promising at all!)</strong>
</li>
</ol><p>Maybe it’s just me, but this really DOESN’T sound like a recipe for success!</p>
<p>Which is why I’ve decided to do things a little bit differently:</p>
<h3>I want YOU to help me write this book!</h3>
<p><strong>Instead of going away for six months and writing in seclusion, I want to write this book <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">in collaboration with the people who need it the most</span>.</strong></p>
<p>I want to share my ideas with you as I write them, develop them in collaboration with you, and get your feedback and input before I waste time writing stuff that you aren’t interested in reading.</p>
<p>Then I’ll write up my ideas, and share them with you – every section and chapter – the moment that I’m done writing them. That way...</p>
<ul>
<li>You’ll be able to apply these ideas right away, and report back about what you’ve done and how it worked.</li>
<li>You’ll be able to tell me what you like and what you don’t, so that I can make the book better than it ever could be if I was writing it alone.</li>
</ul><p><strong>This is a different way of writing a book, and I think it’s the best way – <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">maybe the ONLY way</span> – of writing a book about this subject that will be truly amazing.</strong></p>
<p>Now, I’m sure you’ve already realized that getting involved means investing a small amount of your hard-earned money to this project.</p>
<p>There are two very good reason why this is true:</p>
<h3>Reason #1: Books Cost Money</h3>
<p>Yes, it’s true – there are costs involved in writing and publishing a book.</p>
<p>There’s proofreading and typesetting, there’s cover design, there’s ordering review copies to make sure it’s setup properly, and a whole bunch of other odds and ends.</p>
<p>And believe me, those odds and ends add up!</p>
<p>My last book, Engagement from Scratch!, was paid for by WebFaction and Photos.com; both organizations very generously sponsored the project, to the tune of about $6,000.</p>
<p>I’m not trying to raise nearly as much for this one; all I’m aiming for is $2,500 to cover basic project expenses.</p>
<p>But since this book is really for YOU, I think it’s only fair that you help to pick up the tab – to the tune of at least $25.</p>
<p>Especially because...</p>
<h3>Reason #2: I Won’t Do This Alone!</h3>
<p>I don’t want to spend the next six months of my life writing this book if you don’t absolutely want me to.</p>
<p>Let’s face it – filling out surveys is easy, but it’s when you have to spend a bit of your own money that you really demonstrate that you’re committed to something.</p>
<p><strong>And I really do need you to be committed.</strong> I need your help to make this book amazing, and if you aren’t willing to even put a tiny bit of money into the project, I have to question how invested you’ll be in the entire process of doing this.</p>
<p>Besides, you’ll be in on this entire project from the very beginning, and that’s really valuable – much more than the tiny amount of money that it’ll cost to get involved.</p>
<p>Plus, if you decide to participate, you’ll get all kinds of perks...</p>
<h3>Special Perks for my Writing Team!</h3>
<p>I want to give you every reason to get behind this project, so I’ve put together a huge list of exciting perks that you can get when you join my Writing Team, like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Privileged access to the book materials before anybody else</strong></li>

<li>Free access to the live <strong>Naked Marketing Bootcamp training</strong> series I’m developing</li>
<li>
<strong>1-on-1 marketing and business strategy advice</strong> and coaching from me <em>(I usually charge $250 for 45-minutes)</em>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Acknowledgement, mention, and exposure in the book</strong> when it’s released</li>
</ul><p>The full list of perks is listed on the side of the page, and just to be clear, <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">the perks are CUMULATIVE</span> – so if your investment gets you the signed hardcover, for example, it’ll also get you participation in the project.</p>

</div></div>","Our Story
Since 1946, Pine Canyon Camp has changed lives, serving youth, families and special needs groups.  From May 8 through June 25, 2011, the Horseshoe 2 Fire ravaged 80% of the incomparable Chiricahua Mountains (222,954 acres), destroying some of the most unique vegetation and ecosystems in the world.  
In the middle of this fire area lies the once active Pine Canyon Camp and Retreat Center.  The 15 acre Camp area (leased National Forest land) was mostly untouched by fire; the buildings were saved from fire damage by the firefighters (thank you!!!).  However, the runoff from the subsequent record monsoon rains of July through September 2011 (8.64 inches of precipitation) ran unchecked. The fire left the watershed above Pine Canyon Camp unprotected.  The Camp property has become unusable from the flooding and damage to the Camp’s grounds, facilities and equipment, as well as the road destruction, stream channel movement, and water system intake damage.
We need your help.
 
What We Need
Priorities include: re-establishing access by repairing the roads, rechanneling the stream channel, and establishing erosion control measures for now and the long-term to protect this fragile environment as well as the assets and usability of Pine Canyon Camp.
We are requesting funding to pay for the rental of heavy equipment needed to do the work of moving the dirt and rock that filled the creek channel, destroyed the access road and flooded the buildings.  It is also imperative to put long-term erosion control measures into place in order to protect the natural resources and promote forest recovery.  We have volunteers, both skilled and unskilled labor, ready to do the work necessary (we could always use more!).  We have located a dozer to rent for a reasonable rate and are estimating three months of work for this initial phase to reopen Camp.  Including labor, equipment rental fees,  maintenance, fuel, and materials, we are estimating a cost of $25,000 to complete the clean-up, repairs and erosion control.

Why is Pine Canyon Camp important?
Youth Camp
     One day I spied a pretty little girl about 8 or 9 years old, named Diane*, sitting at a picnic table.  I sat down across from her and casually asked her how her day was going.  She told me how fun it was in Arts & Crafts that morning.  I asked her if she made any new friends this week. She told me about a couple of the girls in her cabin and her counselor.  Somewhere in our discussion she told me that she had been recently adopted.  She told me about how she and her brother used to be homeless, living on the streets with their mother.  Her mother’s “medication” was just too expensive to afford a house to live in.  Sometimes, she said, they would sneak into the back door of her grandma’s house and grandma would feed them. They were really hungry!  
     At Camp she didn’t have to worry about being hungry (mmm . . . it was good!), she didn’t have to worry about where she was going to sleep, AND she could make friends and have fun! She was like everyone else when she was at Camp; she didn’t have to worry about anything when she was at Camp except just being a kid!
 
Camp Hope
     I met Ed*, an autistic 50+ year old man during our camp for developmentally disabled adults, Camp Hope.  The first year I met him, he spent the entire week on the porch at the one smoking spot available, chain-smoking.  He didn’t look at anyone and he didn’t speak to anyone.  He only came off the porch to eat and to go to bed.  Ed’s group home and Camp counselors told me that he looked forward to his week at Camp all year long.  By his third year, he was off that porch, occasionally participating.  By his fifth year, he was holding full conversations, maintaining eye contact, and participating joyfully in most of the Camp activities.
     In a few short years Ed went from an uncommunicative, closed off individual to a cheerful, talkative, happy man and a joy to be around.  He was helpful to his fellow campers and when he arrived home, he was an active member of his group home and community.
 
Strength for the Journey  
     On the last evening at the closing Campfire for our Strength For the Journey retreat (for HIV+/AIDS adults and their caregivers), Jane* stood up to speak.  What she said astounded us all.  She was 38 years old, had grown up on the streets and, like her mother, prostituted herself in order to buy her next high.  She ended up in jail for prostitution; while there she learned she was HIV+.
     That evening she told us “I thank God for giving me this disease.”  We all gasped.  “Because of this disease, I got to come to this retreat – I’ve never been to a place like this.  What I learned here is that I get to actually live whatever life I have left, instead of always looking for my next high, then being too drugged up to actually live.”
     Jane has since married her long-time boyfriend and has worked to regain her health, physically and emotionally.  It hasn’t been easy, but she continues to work towards her goal, with the help her friends she made at Camp.
 
* Names have been changed.
 
Studies done by the American Camp Association (ACA) show that one week spent at summer camp has the following benefits:
·        Children become more self-confident and experience increased self-esteem; 
·        Children develop more social skills that help them make new friends;
·        Children grow more independent and show more leadership qualities;
·        Children become more adventurous and willing to try new things;
·        Children become more aware of the natural environment;
·        Children become better citizens.
Camp is good for families as well.  Studies done by the California Parks and Recreation Society (CPRS) show that:
·        Camping reduces stress in an increasingly demanding and stressful world.
·        Camping enhances overall health and well-being – critical to personal quality of life.
·        Camping significantly reduces health care costs – fitness and well-being reduces both the incidence and the severity of illness and/or disability.
·        Camping helps people live longer adding up to 2 years to life expectancy.
·        Camping builds strong families – the foundation of a healthy community.

<h3>Help Frans study Shugendo in Japan</h3>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.ihreiki.com/images/uploads/frans200.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin: 5px;""/>Frans Stiene is a committed Reiki teacher who, in July 2012, has the unique opportunity to begin Shugendo training in Japan. YOU can help him to raise the funds to go.</p>
<p>Frans has been studying and teaching the system of Reiki from a Japanese perspective since 1999 all around the globe. Those of you who know Frans know that he is 100% committed to his roles as a Reiki teacher and as a student of the practice. His generosity in sharing his path with others is a stand-out amongst Reiki teachers.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that there is little verifiable information about the system of Reiki and its founder available in Japan. Even though this is the case, Frans has made it his mission to try to gain as much insight into what the intentions behind the system were as well as what influenced the founder in its creation.</p>
<p>Shugendo is a Japanese practice that the founder of the system is believed to have practiced and we can see its influence on many of the traditional practices taught in the system of Reiki. Wouldn't it be incredible if there was a better understanding in the Reiki community about these practices?</p>
<p>Recently, an opportunity has come up for Frans to begin training with a Shugendo teacher in Japan. It is rare for a westerner to have this chance and the International House of Reiki wishes to support Frans in this endeavour.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.ihreiki.com/images/uploads/Washington%2020101.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin: 5px;""/>We hope that you, too, would like to support Frans in furthering his knowledge and energetic skills. As a teacher he is in the perfect position to be able to give back to the community from this experience. You get the benefit of his hard work and committment. And we hope this is just the beginning for Frans' further study of Japanese practices.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>How much does he need?</h3>
<p>We worked out he needed approximately $3550 (Australian) to cover travel, living and teaching expenses.  That is broken down into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flight to Japan from Sydney $1000</li>
<li>Accommodation $1000</li>
<li>Food $500</li>
<li>Donation for Training $750</li>
<li>Extras (like Indiegogo %) $300</li>
</ul>
<div>(7% of what you contribute goes to Indiegogo and if we dont reach our goal then they receive 12%)</div>
<h3>What do YOU get out of this?</h3>
<p>If you support Frans in his training, then he would like to support you directly back. You'll see on the right hand side some of the perks we have created just for you. No matter which perk you help out with, you will still get something personal in return.</p>
<p>All money raised will go towards getting Frans to Japan whether we receive the entire goal required or not. Naturally, we hope to acheive the goal AND if we receive more than the goal set out above we will be put it forward to further training for Frans in Japanese practices.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What Difference Will This Training Make?</h3>
<p>We don't have much time to get this money together - so we need to reach our goal as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>The impact that this training in Japan will have on Frans' teachings will be significant, lifting even further his ability to connect energetically with students and to transfer teachings that will change people's lives for the better.</p>
<p>Frans' constant research over the years has shown that he is a teacher who doesn't give up and understands that to be the best teacher he can, he has to walk his talk. Frans doesn't just teach out of books, he teaches out of experience, and we hope to further this level of experience by sending him to Japan.</p>
<p>And one more thing... the more knowledge that the global Reiki community has about the system of Reiki, the better it is for practitioners everywhere - whether they study directly with Frans or not. Trained and experienced teachers like Frans give greater credibility to the system as a whole, making the system of Reiki the perfect complementary health &amp; spiritual practice of choice.</p>

Makerbot 2 printer and materials to fabricate Robohand mechanical device (hand
prosthesis) prototypes for both research and distribution to children with
amniotic band syndrome and finger amputees. </p>
<p><br/>
We believe that the affordability and functionality of these hand devices can
help children with underdeveloped hands (from amniotic band syndrome or other
cause) reach developmental motor milestones and grow with a sense of
inclusiveness and social acceptance. We'd also like to distribute these
Robohands to individuals with injured, amputated, and/or underdeveloped hands
(war veterans, amputees, etc) to help them return to engagement in meaningful
activities (work, sport, art, etc.) while positively impacting their
independence and self worth.</p>

<p>We are currently working with Richard Van As,
founder of Robohand and narrator of the video above. We are also in contact and supported by an occupational therapist that works with child amputees at Miami Children's Hospital.</p>
<p>We are currently constructing a proposal to our
department chair for more funding if our initial pilot project is successful.
This will increase the number of Robohands we're able to create and the amount
of people we can help.</p>

The sooner research starts, the sooner it can be recognized and prescribed to
those that need it. This can reach underdeveloped countries with limited
resources. This can help day to day people return to their lives (work, sport,
art, etc.) after finger amputations. This can give children born with
underdeveloped hands a chance to grow and play with a sense of belonging and
purpose. We want to do more than help people get hands; we want to help people
live happier and more meaningful lives.</p>

Culturs also has a marketplace in the web magazine, and all proceeds from that market will support Culturs' so that the publication can continue to bring great content, free of charge, to this deserving audience and increase global awareness of this population. You can rest assured that every donation will further the cause and go to good use.  While reaching our funding goal will help us expand, any amount will go a long way to providing free, quality content to our readers, viewers and audience! The Marketplace also is where we help support deserving organizations in the U.S. and around the globe.  Check out our press release for more details.  The ImpactOur founder, Doni Luckutt, has an MBA and ran a successful global business for 15 years.  She has been a member of the media for more than two decades and plans to tap those skills to get the word out about this campaign and Culturs. Luckutt's Trinidadian and Costa Rican heritage make her ethnically- and culturally-blended, while her world travels make her a TCK, Military Brat, and Global Nomad. Taking her first international trip at age 2 months, Luckutt lived in 7 countries before adulthood and travel to many more.Our team consists of seasoned photographers, videographers, writers, global experts and more, all of whom currently volunteer their time to create the Culturs product.  The entire team is committed and energized by this audience and the work we do.  We look forward to energizing the community as well!Culturs' internal list, plus our media partnerships in international print, web, and television gives us a reach of multiple millions across the globe!  During this campaign, we will unveil these media partners! We strive to continue creating partnerships that help grow the readership and take this unique content to as many people as possible. And!  We have so many exciting things in the works that will be announced throughout the campaign -- like our celebrity friends, and amazing, once-in-a-lifetime perks!  But rest assured, our contributors and community will be the first to know.  Think of it this way: Some of the world's most coveted events, people and occasions can now be part of your inner circle. And your contributions help us get there. #CantWaitToShare    Other Ways You Can HelpWe'd love if everyone could donate, but getting the word out is a great help as well!  Use the Indiegogo social media links to easily send our information to five friends you think could help us reach our goal or forward to their friends.  Together, we can make this happen!Check out our perks!  We have some cool gear, trips and celebrity perks still being solidified....check in often to see what's new!Welcome to Culturs.guru.  Welcome HOME.",15.0,1,"1 Campaign

<div>I am a 19 year old student from the Dominican Republic. I am currently attending university here. <br/><br/>Since I can remember, I have always liked history, travelling and I have been fascinated with the scandinavian way of living. This is why I decided to apply to a bachelor degree in history at a university in Norway. This country is by far my favourite place on earth and this is why I have decided to go there but there are some obstacles I have to pass before reaching my goal, and the economic obstacle is one.<br/><br/>I want to become a teacher in the field of history and social sciences. I would like to give something positive back to our society by becoming a qualified and good teacher. In Norway education is almost perfect so I can not think of any other place that could give me the chance to become what I want to be.  This campaign is very important for me as it can be a life changing 
opportunity and can give me the opportunity to get quality education, something I can not find in my own country, in order to become a
 qualified proffesional. I will be an amazing

<p>Culture Relay’s mission is to create female leaders of tomorrow through a year long program that uses running to teach leaderships skills to high school girls.  We have partnered with schools across the world to create a virtual classroom. We prepare girls to run the world by teaching them how to set goals, overcome challenges, develop grit, and get results. Training together to run a half marathon is the first step. Once they cross the finish line, they exercise all they have learned on local projects approved by their business mentor. </p>

expanding our program to other US states and countries


                       


  How we evaluate success 
 Working with the associate Dean for Research at University of Alabama, we have created a pre and post program evaluation to understand the efficacy of Culture Relay's impact.  This test consists of 30 questions regarding self confidence, body image, exercise, nutrition, and leaderships skills.
Along with our pre/post program evaluation, we also measure 4 outputs:



#
of Graduating Participants

# of participants who complete the race
# of steps/strides in training
# of incubator projects

My name is Guido Nisenson, I am a sound engineer and music producer from Argentina living in Spain and I have been working  all over the world recording musicians for more than 30 years. I met with Jigme and the Exile Brothers in February 2014 in Dharamsala, India, through my friends at Playing For Change who had met and recorded them a few years earlier. Since the moment I met with Jigme and his community, I realized that their main need was related to what I had been doing all my life: recording and producing music.Guido has worked with Playing For Change on several occasions as both a sound engineer for the PFC Band shows and a recording engineer, and he has traveled with the crew to places such as Morocco, India, Spain, Brazil and the USA.
The goal of this new project is to create a community recording studio in Dharamsala, teach essential skills on how to produce recordings and how to manage the studio and equipments, setting up the foundation of a sustainable educational music program.By contributing to this project you will help preserve and transmit a universal heritage and give a voice to a stateless community in need of inspiration and new ways to express its cultural identity through music. In February
2014, I went to Dharamsala to meet with the Exile Brothers and study the possibility
of creating this recording studio and music program in the area of McLeod Ganj (Dharamsala). During my two-month stay I initiated the training of local musicians to the art of recording and mixing and recorded 2 albums with them.It is now time to return and take this collaboration to the next level by setting up the recording studio with them and continuing to train them on using the equipments, producing their own music, recording local artists and encouraging them to share their musical talent in the community.---BUDGET: 8000 USD83,75 % of the budget of the project will be allocated to buy recording equipments, the rest will cover the flight to Delhi.I already managed to get 2 computers donated, a basic audio interface and a few pieces of recording equipment through my networks.

Sustaining
the operating budget:The recording equipment and training represent an investment that will create opportunities to help sustain the project. 
The will be cultural exchanges with Western musicians who can come to learn traditional

Construction program:<br/>Houses with ecological techniques, backyard agriculture. Formative Program: our<br/>methodology. Recreation Program: visit to swim, to the movie theater, parks,<br/>museums, etc.<br/>We actually serve on average 120 people daily, which spans an average of 50<br/>families. </p><p><strong><em>SHARING THE FIRE:</em></strong></p><p>We have been working with this community for over 20 years;<br/>6 of which we have been working a curriculum created by Gracia Esteva (pedagogic<br/>counceler), and they include Freinet, Freire, Education for Peace, The 4<br/>Tolteca Agreements by Don Miguel Ruíz and Creative Transformation by John David<br/>García (RIP) educational techniques. We propose –based on the evolution- that if we replicate<br/>Evolutional Key Moments in the history of humanity, we gain access to ancestral<br/>memories which make sinapsis in their brains; thus leading to an ethical and<br/>creative society. We state that there are no morals in any social level; that<br/>honor is lost and we can not appeal for values that are not there…  we create the pre-value:</p><p>The older takes care for the younger</p><p>The one that knows more teaches the one that knows less</p><p>The only prize is to learn</p><p>The only punishment is to not be creative</p><p>This, alongside the workshops given by Gracia Esteva and the<br/>4 Toltec Agreements create an ethical society; starting in Caminando Unidos and<br/>spreading amongst the neighbourhoods where we live. Even though it is a<br/>curriculum that takes place with marginal-conditions population, foreign<br/>volunteers, people working here and not living in the neighbourhood and<br/>everyone that Works or has been involved in Caminando Unidos has been touched<br/>by this methodology and have addopted it in their lives. This proves the<br/>methodology Works no matter which social conditions we live in. </p><p>We plan to avoid normalizing the unbearable; there is<br/>violence  and bullying and we have<br/>erradicated that… we refuse to normalise it and we have changed it. Violence<br/>reduced to 0% in the first 12 months, and for the next 5 years bullying<br/>dissapeared. We have received national and foreign volunteers, and ther´s<br/>been universities that have seen our path and asked us to reply our model; and<br/>even though we have the material for the documentation, we have not the knowledge<br/>to generate a manual. Caminando Unidos has funcioned out of donations; the<br/>proposal to generate a video and a manual alongside our workshops is that we<br/>become able to make a trade with them and charge for them. Caminando Unidos ´s<br/>dream is for our youngsters to travel around the world to share our methodology<br/>and our knowledge. Your donation is very important because you directly support<br/>our youngsters and children, you certify our job and become yourself a maker of<br/>this dream which is Caminando Unidos.</p><p>WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET</p><p>Our intention is to hire 4 professionals who give us<br/>training in video, audio, script-writing <br/>and edition. We need to buy cameras, microfone, computer and edition<br/>programs.</p><p>Likewise we need documentarysts to process the existing<br/>information, to teach us show to create better instruments of documentation and<br/>the design and printing of the manuals.</p><p>The final outcome will be a video and a manual, also our<br/>workshops to be replicated.

Construction program:Houses with ecological techniques, backyard agriculture. Formative Program: ourmethodology. Recreation Program: visit to swim, to the movie theater, parks,museums, etc.We actually serve on average 120 people daily, which spans an average of 50families. SHARING THE FIRE:We have been working with this community for over 20 years;6 of which we have been working a curriculum created by Gracia Esteva (pedagogiccounceler), and they include Freinet, Freire, Education for Peace, The 4Tolteca Agreements by Don Miguel Ruíz and Creative Transformation by John DavidGarcía (RIP) educational techniques. We propose –based on the evolution- that if we replicateEvolutional Key Moments in the history of humanity, we gain access to ancestralmemories which make sinapsis in their brains; thus leading to an ethical andcreative society. We state that there are no morals in any social level; thathonor is lost and we can not appeal for values that are not there…  we create the pre-value:The older takes care for the youngerThe one that knows more teaches the one that knows lessThe only prize is to learnThe only punishment is to not be creativeThis, alongside the workshops given by Gracia Esteva and the4 Toltec Agreements create an ethical society; starting in Caminando Unidos andspreading amongst the neighbourhoods where we live. Even though it is acurriculum that takes place with marginal-conditions population, foreignvolunteers, people working here and not living in the neighbourhood andeveryone that Works or has been involved in Caminando Unidos has been touchedby this methodology and have addopted it in their lives. This proves themethodology Works no matter which social conditions we live in. We plan to avoid normalizing the unbearable; there isviolence  and bullying and we haveerradicated that… we refuse to normalise it and we have changed it. Violencereduced to 0% in the first 12 months, and for the next 5 years bullyingdissapeared. We have received national and foreign volunteers, and ther´sbeen universities that have seen our path and asked us to reply our model; andeven though we have the material for the documentation, we have not the knowledgeto generate a manual. Caminando Unidos has funcioned out of donations; theproposal to generate a video and a manual alongside our workshops is that webecome able to make a trade with them and charge for them. Caminando Unidos ´sdream is for our youngsters to travel around the world to share our methodologyand our knowledge. Your donation is very important because you directly supportour youngsters and children, you certify our job and become yourself a maker ofthis dream which is Caminando Unidos.WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GETOur intention is to hire 4 professionals who give ustraining in video, audio, script-writing and edition. We need to buy cameras, microfone, computer and editionprograms.Likewise we need documentarysts to process the existinginformation, to teach us show to create better instruments of documentation andthe design and printing of the manuals.The final outcome will be a video and a manual, also ourworkshops to be replicated. This all has a cost of u$ 80,000, our goal is toreach 50,000 USD. We are willing to pay the difference; however if we exceedthe goal we can create better quality manuals and each extra dollar will beused to improve the conditions inside our community house. If we dont reach ourgoal we wont be able to to begin the documentation and info-processing process.With your donation you will be able to get amazing perks;like your own kit to start a fire, a mud piece created by our children,pictures, or your name written on our donors Wall. THE IMPACTThis dream coming true it will impact directly to our membres families; and wewill begin replicating this model as of 2015 with at least 3 universities andtheir social work students.Just like it happened with our 2 ecological houses in theneighbourhood; we hope to ignite an ethical and creative spreading of ourmethodology.

Welcome to this campaign! My name is Rashlin and I have been working closely with the HMGC, a community based organisation for 3 years.  Working with these girls, the most hardworking and driven that I have met, has not only humbled me, but driven me to make sure they get what they deserve!  The centre teaches girls like Carolyne and Pracxedes core values, and supports the development of their entrepreneurial, social and life skills to help them break out of the vicious cycle of poverty. 



In the slums there are very few resources: water; sanitation; electricity. HMGC acts as a home away from home, providing safe water, free food and education. HMGC has dedicated mentors who love, care and support the young women who participate. Those who have passed through this centre have found good educational opportunities, moved on to responsible jobs, are educating their siblings, and have experienced better living conditions overall. Many even come back to mentor other girls, in turn creating a virtuous cycle.


As the founder of the centre, Shariffa Keshavjee told me: ""To know how to do something isn't enough - these women who have been previously overlooked now need confidence.""

This campaign aims to raise money to pay for university and college fees for 10  girls who have graduated from the centre,  and continue to support the day to day running of the HMGC, which includes providing free education and food, dental care, counselling sessions and AIDS awareness. HMGC has previously been nominated for the World Challenge (as shown in the video) and acknowledged by the World Bank. 


What We Need & What You Get


University education for 4 girls: £8000 (This covers fees for 2.5 years)

Medical training for 1 girl: £1200

Catering school for 5 girls: £1800

Cost of running the centre for two years: (This covers food for the girls, medical checks, dental care, classes for HIV awareness and lessons in computing and girl guide training): £12,000


The Impact



Contributions will allow the girls to to attend medical school, universities and colleges around Kenya. This will allow them to have a brighter future, give back to their communities, and provide financial security for their families.


Although Kenya has achieved gender parity, this does not mean universal access to education.  Currently, only half of secondary school age girls are enrolled in further education, due to factors including poverty, inadequate infrastructure, and HIV. Thus, due to socio-cultural norms, when push comes to shove in these situations, boys' education is given higher preference over girls'.

Up to this point, the school has been used as an unstructured artistic space where lovers of music and the arts can come to express themselves, but we are looking to renovate the current studio into a space truly conducive to the creative spirit of our students.  </p>
<p>In 2011, famed Cameroonian guitarist As'a Telong established the As'a Telong Music Academy in Dschang <b><i>with a vision of giving his students an opportunity to not only learn music but also infuse their young minds with creativity and passion</i></b>. With no emphasis on music education in their schools in addition to enormous price tags on purchasing instruments, Cameroonian youth do not usually have the opportunity to learn music. It may be surprising to find that in a country such as Cameroon, where music and dance is a pivotal part of culture, learning music is reserved for a select few elite with expendable income, but not for everyone. <b><u>ATMA's mission is to change that</u></b>. </p>
<p>As Dschang is a longtime <b>Peace Corps</b> post, the As'a Telong Music Academy has a history of collaboration with four Peace Corps Volunteers; at present, <b>Justin Park</b> (Education 2013-2015) and <b>David Anctil</b> (Youth Development 2014-2016) work at ATMA teaching Piano and Singing respectively. Between As'a, Justin, David, and several other teachers who <b><u>volunteer</u></b> their time and talents, children at ATMA are offered a variety of courses : <b>Guitar</b> (all levels), <b>Piano</b> (all levels), a group <b>Chorus</b>, <b>Music and Solfege</b>, <b>Traditional Dance</b>, <b>Percussion</b> (all levels), and a <b>Sanza</b> workshop, where students apprentice with our Sanza master to create the unique African instrument to sell to profit the school. </p>
<p>While each course demands a specific price which is as competitive (<i>affordable</i>) as possible, <u>the huge majority of students at ATMA are on scholarship</u>, and trade some services (sweeping the floors, cleaning the dance mirror) for the opportunity to take classes at the academy while they contribute financially what they can. Considering the financial state of many residents of Dschang mixed with a typical disinterest on the parents' behalves that their children pursue musical education, <b><i>every child and young adult who takes music or dance classes at ATMA does so because they have a strong personal passion for music that urges them to look past these obstacles and pursue their dreams</i></b>. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Our group consists of nine students and three teachers from Benjamin Franklin High School in Baltimore, MD.  Our school is located in south side of the inner-city between Brooklyn and Curtis Bay.  </p>
<p>For the first time ever, we are trying to take an international service trip to Ecuador.  This June, we hope to spend nine days traveling, immersing ourselves in a different culture, practicing our Spanish language skills, and serving others. </p>

<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>We would really appreciate donations, as our students and teachers are trying to fully fund their trips without placing too much of the burden on our families.  Our group is working tirelessly to fundraise the entirety of our expenses, and we would be extremely thankful for any contribution.</p>
<p>While our group needs to raise over $25,000, we hope to raise $6,000 through donations on indiegogo.  </p>

<h2><strong>---</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>Who is Solar Ship? </strong></h2>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">The idea to build a solarship for Africa started on February 5, 1983 with a mission to deliver critical supplies to remote areas. The first flight was planned to take off from Cape Town and land in the areas around Lake Tanganyika and Lake Victoria.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Since 1992 we have been involved in dozens of charitable projects in Canada's north with First Nations communities as well as communities across Africa. These projects have created partners for Solar Ship throughout eastern and southern Africa, Madagascar and northern Canada. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">We built and flew the first prototype in 2009. We have built 3 additional prototypes since then and have been flying since 2010 with regulatory approval.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">This IndieGoGo campaign was created to fund Solar Ship's first mission to Africa.</span></p>
<h2 class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">What is a Solarship?</span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Powered by the sun and assisted by helium, the solarship is a hybrid aircraft —part bush plane, part airship. It’s a reliable, sustainably powered form of air transport able to operate where there are no roads or fuel supplies - it can take off and land in areas as small as a soccer field. The blend of aerodynamic lift, aerostatic lift and solar creates cost efficient air transport for areas with minimal or no infrastructure. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""><strong>Watch the videos below to learn more about the solarship.</strong></span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""><strong><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4vG4jmqPn4&amp;feature=plcp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Solar Ship Test Flights"">Solar Ship Test Flights</a></strong></span></p>
<p class=""p2""><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf_2E2IPk1M&amp;feature=plcp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Introduction to Solar Ship""><span class=""s1""><strong>Introduction to Solar Ship</strong></span></a></p>
<h2 class=""p4""><span class=""s1""><strong>The Mission</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">We take off from Cape Town and we stop every 500km to pick up a fresh round of medical supplies from our partners and deliver them to villages in the surrounding area. We do this ten times over forty days and finish in the Great Lakes region of Africa including Burundi, the country that inspired the idea in the first place.</span></p>
<h2><span class=""s1"">Where We Are Now</span></h2>
<p><span class=""s1"">Solar Ship was awarded a grant to build the next generation solarship and fly critical supplies to First Nations communities in the North.</span></p>
<p><span class=""s1"">This means the funding required to develop the components and fly in North America are secured. What is not secured, is a dedicated solarship for Africa.</span></p>
<h2><span class=""s1"">Why Do We Need Money Now?</span></h2>
<p><span class=""s1"">While our North American mission is underway, we plan to be building, testing and training our pilots for the African mission, which will be launched immediately after the northern Canada project. </span></p>
<p><span class=""s1"">To put costs into perspective, the mission to Canada's north costs $6.2 million.</span></p>
<p><span class=""s1"">If we raise at least $1M here on IndieGoGo, we can cover the travel and operating costs needed to complete the African mission.</span></p>
<p><span class=""s1"">100% of the funds raised on this campaign will be used to cover these costs.</span></p>
<h2><span class=""s1"">Solar Ship's Micro-Sponsorship Program</span></h2>
<p><span class=""s1"">You'll see in our perks section that we've created space on the ship for your logos, messages and ideas. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Solar Ship has created a micro-sponsorship program to fund the launch of this breakthrough technology into the most threatened places on earth. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">You can sponsor the mission and the technology by purchasing ""patches"" of logo space on the solarship which will also be reproduced digitally on our website. Sponsors can be anyone - individuals, organizations, or corporations.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1""><img alt=""Solar Ship Banner"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://solarship.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Solarship-org-Pixel-Ship_web.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Solar Ship Banner""/><br/></span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">When you buy a patch, you have an opportunity to advertise your business, cause, or brand. You can buy as many patches as you like, as long as they are available. The more patches you purchase, the more prominent your image will be, both on the web and the aircraft itself.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">We would like to use this platform to lower the costs of delivering this technology to the poorest places with the highest transport costs. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">In the event of overfunding, we will extend our African mission and deliver more critical supplies to more places. </span></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>What is a Patch?</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">A patch, or a group of patches, represents one sponsor’s logo space. These patches will form a banner that will be permanently fixed on the leading edge of the solarship. The banner will be reproduced on our website and kept online for at least 5 years. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">There are 8,000 patches available.  </span></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>How It Works </strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">After the campaign is complete, you will be asked to send us a hi-res image as well as an associated web link of your choice. Your image can be a corporate logo, a text-based message or a photo, the choice is yours. </span></p>
<h3 class=""p2""><span class=""s1""><strong>Expected Schedule</strong></span></h3>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Website Launch - March, 2013</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Northern Canada Mission - Summer 2014</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">African Mission - Fall 2014</span></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">How Much do the Patches Cost?</span></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The FAMILY PATCH costs $125. It is roughly 1/4 the size of the green patches below. Looks small here, but will be highly visible on the solarship.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">One GREEN patch costs $500.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">One RED patch (the size of 4 Green patches) costs $2,000.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">One BLUE patch (the size of 6 Green patches) costs $3,000.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">One YELLOW patch (the size of 25 Green patches) costs $10,000.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">On the website, the patches will be clearly visible with a zoom feature and a link to a URL provided by you.</span></p>

Who is Solar Ship? 
The idea to build a solarship for Africa started on February 5, 1983 with a mission to deliver critical supplies to remote areas. The first flight was planned to take off from Cape Town and land in the areas around Lake Tanganyika and Lake Victoria.
Since 1992 we have been involved in dozens of charitable projects in Canada's north with First Nations communities as well as communities across Africa. These projects have created partners for Solar Ship throughout eastern and southern Africa, Madagascar and northern Canada. 
We built and flew the first prototype in 2009. We have built 3 additional prototypes since then and have been flying since 2010 with regulatory approval.
This IndieGoGo campaign was created to fund Solar Ship's first mission to Africa.
What is a Solarship?
Powered by the sun and assisted by helium, the solarship is a hybrid aircraft —part bush plane, part airship. It’s a reliable, sustainably powered form of air transport able to operate where there are no roads or fuel supplies - it can take off and land in areas as small as a soccer field. The blend of aerodynamic lift, aerostatic lift and solar creates cost efficient air transport for areas with minimal or no infrastructure. 
Watch the videos below to learn more about the solarship.
Solar Ship Test Flights
Introduction to Solar Ship
The Mission
We take off from Cape Town and we stop every 500km to pick up a fresh round of medical supplies from our partners and deliver them to villages in the surrounding area. We do this ten times over forty days and finish in the Great Lakes region of Africa including Burundi, the country that inspired the idea in the first place.
Where We Are Now
Solar Ship was awarded a grant to build the next generation solarship and fly critical supplies to First Nations communities in the North.
This means the funding required to develop the components and fly in North America are secured. What is not secured, is a dedicated solarship for Africa.
Why Do We Need Money Now?
While our North American mission is underway, we plan to be building, testing and training our pilots for the African mission, which will be launched immediately after the northern Canada project. 
To put costs into perspective, the mission to Canada's north costs $6.2 million.
If we raise at least $1M here on IndieGoGo, we can cover the travel and operating costs needed to complete the African mission.
100% of the funds raised on this campaign will be used to cover these costs.
Solar Ship's Micro-Sponsorship Program
You'll see in our perks section that we've created space on the ship for your logos, messages and ideas. 
Solar Ship has created a micro-sponsorship program to fund the launch of this breakthrough technology into the most threatened places on earth. 
You can sponsor the mission and the technology by purchasing ""patches"" of logo space on the solarship which will also be reproduced digitally on our website. Sponsors can be anyone - individuals, organizations, or corporations.

When you buy a patch, you have an opportunity to advertise your business, cause, or brand. You can buy as many patches as you like, as long as they are available. The more patches you purchase, the more prominent your image will be, both on the web and the aircraft itself.
We would like to use this platform to lower the costs of delivering this technology to the poorest places with the highest transport costs. 
In the event of overfunding, we will extend our African mission and deliver more critical supplies to more places. 
What is a Patch?
A patch, or a group of patches, represents one sponsor’s logo space. These patches will form a banner that will be permanently fixed on the leading edge of the solarship. The banner will be reproduced on our website and kept online for at least 5 years. 
There are 8,000 patches available.  
How It Works 
After the campaign is complete, you will be asked to send us a hi-res image as well as an associated web link of your choice. Your image can be a corporate logo, a text-based message or a photo, the choice is yours. 
Expected Schedule
Website Launch - March, 2013
Northern Canada Mission - Summer 2014
African Mission - Fall 2014
How Much do the Patches Cost?
The FAMILY PATCH costs $125. It is roughly 1/4 the size of the green patches below. Looks small here, but will be highly visible on the solarship.
One GREEN patch costs $500.
One RED patch (the size of 4 Green patches) costs $2,000.
One BLUE patch (the size of 6 Green patches) costs $3,000.
One YELLOW patch (the size of 25 Green patches) costs $10,000.
On the website, the patches will be clearly visible with a zoom feature and a link to a URL provided by you.

This image is not to scale. It is intended to give you a general idea of how large the patches are relative to one another.
Additional Perks:
For $25,000
