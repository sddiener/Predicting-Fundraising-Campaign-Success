<div>The GTRS Intelligent Guitar is a brand-new electric guitar brand powered by MOOER Audio. Over the past 10 years, MOOER Audio have been hard at work creating state of the art digital effects algorithms and sampling technology for guitar, amp, and cabinet simulations.  In October of 2019, we started collaborating with instrument designer Kenji Wong on developing the GTRS line as MOOER’s first fully integrated electric guitar effects system.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>With GTRS, it is our mission to bring the latest audio technology to musicians while honoring a long guitar tradition. We believe that with the GTRS series, passionate musicians can play more often at home or on the road without sacrificing their tone (or their back).</div>
<div> </div>
</div>
<div><div><div><p>The GTRS ecosystem starts off with the one-of-a-kind guitar equipped with the GTRS Intelligent Processor System. This guitar is designed to function with and be controlled by its dedicated mobile application to offer seamless integration of traditional guitar features and modern digital simulation technology. The GWF4 Wireless Footswitch is also available to provide complete control of your tone during live performance, recording, or practice sessions.</p></div></div></div>

<p>The GTRS Intelligent Guitar is designed to adapt to a variety of situations for a variety of guitar players. No matter if you're new to guitar or a seasoned professional, the GTRS Intelligent Guitar can meet your needs.</p>
<p>The GTRS Team has been hard at work on balancing traditional electric guitar sensibilities and modern simulation technology. As a result, GTRS was designed by experienced instrument builders and built with high-quality materials. Working with the built-in Intelligent Processor System makes the GTRS guitar more practical for guitar players to use anywhere, anytime.</p>
<p>The GTRS Intelligent Processor System includes 9 classic guitar simulations, 126 guitar effects, 40 drum grooves, 10 metronome variations, and an 80-second looper. All settings can be quickly edited through the GTRS app with more simulation files and effects planned to be released in the future. The Super-Knob and GWF4 wireless footswitch enable quick preset changes during live performance and the built-in chargeable &amp; replaceable battery frees you from low battery anxiety. Guitarists can even use a single OTG cable to set up a live stream while performing.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>For Guitar Beginners and Pros</strong></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1623052666/blrmhvnn3hcmxgup1m64.jpg"" src=""""/>GTRS includes multiple categorized presets for quickly selecting different tones. Beginners can simply select a preset in their favorite style without having to worry about creating their own custom tones. By using the GTRS app,  presets can be easily downloaded from other users or artists. the GTRS app also has a built-in guitar chord dictionary, drum machine, and tuner so theres no need to switch between apps. You can also use another mobile device to play tracks when you practice. </p>
<p>For guitar beginners, it can be discouraging to spend hours trying to recreate the same tones as your guitar heroes. We believe the easier it is to recreate your favorite sound, the more motivated you will be to learn. Over time, beginners can learn more about different guitar effects without having to invest tons of money on different pedals and guitars just to find out what they like.</p>
<p>It's quite big task for guitarists on tour - all the pedalboard, amps, equipment and set up become increasingly difficult to haul and distract from the enjoyment of the tour and the music. GTRS aims to solve this problem by providing a product that can be setup and controlled by a mobile application, but doesn’t solely rely on while playing. After setting all presets in the GTRS guitar and/or Footswitch, players can quickly switch between all presets on the fly without fiddling with their phone or tablet.</p>

<p>The first Standard 800 model features an American basswood body, roasted Canadian maple neck, and a rosewood fingerboard that feels great in the hand. The Custom S-S-H alnico pickup configuration was specifically chosen to provide the maximum amount of tonal flexibility while adhering to tried-and-true guitar designs. With the GTRS system turned off, all the functionality of a ""normal"" guitar remains and your Standard 800 can still be plugged in to your favorite amp, pedals, or effects unit.</p>

</div></div>","The GTRS Intelligent Guitar is a brand-new electric guitar brand powered by MOOER Audio. Over the past 10 years, MOOER Audio have been hard at work creating state of the art digital effects algorithms and sampling technology for guitar, amp, and cabinet simulations.  In October of 2019, we started collaborating with instrument designer Kenji Wong on developing the GTRS line as MOOER’s first fully integrated electric guitar effects system.
 
With GTRS, it is our mission to bring the latest audio technology to musicians while honoring a long guitar tradition. We believe that with the GTRS series, passionate musicians can play more often at home or on the road without sacrificing their tone (or their back).
 

The GTRS ecosystem starts off with the one-of-a-kind guitar equipped with the GTRS Intelligent Processor System. This guitar is designed to function with and be controlled by its dedicated mobile application to offer seamless integration of traditional guitar features and modern digital simulation technology. The GWF4 Wireless Footswitch is also available to provide complete control of your tone during live performance, recording, or practice sessions.
 


 

The GTRS Intelligent Guitar is designed to adapt to a variety of situations for a variety of guitar players. No matter if you're new to guitar or a seasoned professional, the GTRS Intelligent Guitar can meet your needs.
The GTRS Team has been hard at work on balancing traditional electric guitar sensibilities and modern simulation technology. As a result, GTRS was designed by experienced instrument builders and built with high-quality materials. Working with the built-in Intelligent Processor System makes the GTRS guitar more practical for guitar players to use anywhere, anytime.
The GTRS Intelligent Processor System includes 9 classic guitar simulations, 126 guitar effects, 40 drum grooves, 10 metronome variations, and an 80-second looper. All settings can be quickly edited through the GTRS app with more simulation files and effects planned to be released in the future. The Super-Knob and GWF4 wireless footswitch enable quick preset changes during live performance and the built-in chargeable & replaceable battery frees you from low battery anxiety. Guitarists can even use a single OTG cable to set up a live stream while performing.
 
All-in-one GTRS Intelligent Processor System

The GTRS Intelligent Processor System is the key difference from traditional guitars. This small black box includes MOOER's top tech for samples, simulations, and effects algorithms. Everything is built-in to the GTRS Intelligent Processor System to work smoothly while playing your guitar and switching between presets and settings. You can use the Super-Knob to change your saved presets directly or you can connect the Intelligent Guitar System to your Android/iOS/iPad OS devices for more detailed tweaking.
The Intelligent Guitar System includes guitar amp modelling, cab simulation, a variety of guitar effects, and guitar simulation. Multiple output options make it easy to use GTRS in a variety of playing situations.

 
Say Goodbye to Traditional Effects Boards

GTRS has inherited years of audio algorithms from previous MOOER multi-effects pedals. We have chosen 126 high quality effects that can be accessed through the GTRS Intelligent Processor System.  With the GTRS APP, all the effects parameters can be easily edited and saved as presets. Individual effects in the effects chain can also be rearranged for maximum customization.

 
GTRS Guitar Simulation


GTRS Intelligent guitar also includes the latest MNRS technology for guitar simulation.  There are 9 classic guitar sims built-in to the GTRS Intelligent Processor System. Each guitar sim will be downloaded automatically when selected from inside the app. The initial release will feature 9 guitar sim choices such as a '58 Les Paul, a '52 Tele, a 60s Strat, and others with several more planned for future updates.

 
For Guitar Beginners and Pros
GTRS includes multiple categorized presets for quickly selecting different tones. Beginners can simply select a preset in their favorite style without having to worry about creating their own custom tones. By using the GTRS app,  presets can be easily downloaded from other users or artists. the GTRS app also has a built-in guitar chord dictionary, drum machine, and tuner so theres no need to switch between apps. You can also use another mobile device to play tracks when you practice. 
For guitar beginners, it can be discouraging to spend hours trying to recreate the same tones as your guitar heroes. We believe the easier it is to recreate your favorite sound, the more motivated you will be to learn. Over time, beginners can learn more about different guitar effects without having to invest tons of money on different pedals and guitars just to find out what they like.
It's quite big task for guitarists on tour - all the pedalboard, amps, equipment and set up become increasingly difficult to haul and distract from the enjoyment of the tour and the music. GTRS aims to solve this problem by providing a product that can be setup and controlled by a mobile application, but doesn’t solely rely on while playing. After setting all presets in the GTRS guitar and/or Footswitch, players can quickly switch between all presets on the fly without fiddling with their phone or tablet.

 


 
About the Guitar

The first Standard 800 model features an American basswood body, roasted Canadian maple neck, and a rosewood fingerboard that feels great in the hand. The Custom S-S-H alnico pickup configuration was specifically chosen to provide the maximum amount of tonal flexibility while adhering to tried-and-true guitar designs. With the GTRS system turned off, all the functionality of a ""normal"" guitar remains and your Standard 800 can still be plugged in to your favorite amp, pedals, or effects unit.


 

 
About GTRS Intelligent Processor System

<p>Nathan George and his friends noticed that music has become small, convenient, and personal. Although music is intimate, it has become very isolated and constrained. They wanted to create a product that lets music be big, bold, and shared — a product that sets music free. The Kube Sound team shares a simple but meaningful idea that music should complement space, not compete with it. To bring this vision to life, they called upon the best in engineering, design, and manufacturing. Audio experts united not only by their drive for perfection but also by their love for music. The result is Kube4, a portable speaker designed for the outside world. The team likes the sound of it, and they think you will too.</p>

</div></div>","It's meant to be shared at sound levels that stir the soul. With massive output and a portable design, Kube4 is made to move you.
After our wild success with the original Kube, shipping to over 40 countries and completely selling out last summer, we're back with a redesigned, next gen speaker.

 
 

An ergonomic handle and a lightness of just 21 pounds make Kube4 the most portable - and frankly, the only practical - device in its class.

 

 

 

 
 

Just how high can Kube4 turn it up?

 

With the most cutting-edge mesh WiFi technology, use our advanced multi-room or multi-stream features to play music in sync across the whole house - or choose different songs for different spaces.

 

Enjoy over 10 times the range you’d get with a traditional bluetooth speaker with mesh WiFi technology. With a range of up to 300 feet, the party doesn’t stop until you say so.

 

With up to 40 hours of battery life, Kube4 keeps the party going all weekend long, day and night.

 

With water resistance rated at IPX5, Kube4 is not only perfect indoors, but in the great outdoors too - rain or shine.

 

With deep bass and true highs, Kube4 delivers balanced sound without clipping or distortion - even when you crank it all the way up.

 

Turn it on and press play. No wires, cables, or outlets needed.

 

Seamlessly syncs with Wifi instead of just Bluetooth, so your device’s notifications won’t crash the party.

 

Connect a microphone to Kube, and you have an instant PA system right at your fingertips.

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

Elegant design doesn’t stand out like other party box speakers, no more tacky LED lights necessary

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
Nathan George and his friends noticed that music has become small, convenient, and personal. Although music is intimate, it has become very isolated and constrained. They wanted to create a product that lets music be big, bold, and shared — a product that sets music free. The Kube Sound team shares a simple but meaningful idea that music should complement space, not compete with it. To bring this vision to life, they called upon the best in engineering, design, and manufacturing. Audio experts united not only by their drive for perfection but also by their love for music. The result is Kube4, a portable speaker designed for the outside world. The team likes the sound of it, and they think you will too.
 


 
 

 
 

 

We are able to ship worldwide. VAT and GST not included. Please see reward for details on the shipping cost that applies to you.
 

We plan to ship starting in October 2021 We will keep you up to date on our progress and the expected delivery date of your order.

And if you're teaching an interactive class, like only dance classes, yoga or a field trip, you can switch on the binaural microphones so your students are immersed in your environment.And best of all, the FinaLace app can transcribe your class automatically, so you can send out class notes with one tap on the app when you record a video or audio class.Since launching this campaign, we've been overwhelmed with how many of our backers from the previous two Sabinetek campaigns came back to support us again. We are so grateful for your continued support and glowing reviews.Reviews of our previous products which use some of the same technology including super low latency Bluetooth stereo, noise suppression, wireless mixing, real-time monitoring and AI transcription. When you listen to something that's recorded with FinaLace, you'll hear what happens to your right on the right, and what happens to your left on the left. The central lead vocal microphone is a breakthrough application in immersive 3D recording. It provides an excellent experience when you're recording vlogs, or when you're in calls or live streaming. What makes FinaLace unique in the world of binaural audio, is that it doesn't just have two binaural microphones, but it has a third microphone dedicated to voice pickup. This 3-channel setup allows you to create both immersive content with a clear voice track which you can toggle on or off.At Sabinetek we're no strangers to this technology. In fact we pioneered wearable binaural recording, and we've been producing full-size binaural microphones that have been a community favorite for years.The difference between one mic on your phone and FinaLace is huge. Listen to the difference between recording the same scene on your phone, and the recording made with FinaLace. The difference is incredible!Last year we launched AudioWow on Kickstarter, and over 2,500 backers brought it to life. AudioWoW was our first portable audio product with a built-in sound card bringing audio to life like never before. FinaLace also has a built-in sound card, integrated with digital sound effects, plus the benefits of great-sounding earbuds and binaural audio recording. Transparency mode is another new feature on FinaLace. With transparency mode, you decide how much or how little you want to hear from the outside world. If you're in the zone with your music, simply shut off the world outside, but if you need to hear ambient sound such as traffic and talking to people without taking off the FinaLace, the binaural mics lets sound pass through the earbuds.Unlike the transparency mode of other sport headphones, our technology is based on the real time monitoring of microphone and built-in digital sound effects. You can adjust the volume of the ambient sound you want to hear and add 3 levels of noise suppression to ensure safety without too much noise. Use the SmartMike+ as receiver for any device with a 3.5mm jack audio input. FinaLace and SmartMike+ share a proprietary Bluetooth protocol giving you quality wireless audio recording. For live streaming you can use T/R mode, but note that phones and computer only work with a stereo input, and not 3D audio.Using FinaLace is really as simple as downloading our app, connecting FinaLace with Bluetooth and being ready to rock ’n roll. It simplifies the process for content creators. No post-editing is needed unless you want to. Traditional processes to create content may take 5 to 10 hours in post editing. With our app it just takes 10 minutes for content to be ready to share.  Also, to make life easier for our backers, we've decided to merge the apps for SmartMike+, AudioWoW, and FinaLace into one.       SabineTek was founded in June 2014 by a group of acoustics, telecommunications, and electronic engineering experts with a commitment to connecting the world through sound. The company has been leading the way in cutting edge wireless digital audio transmission technology research and development. SabineTek creates and builds innovative products that equip content creators in the music, entertainment, education, live streaming, health and many other industries with powerful, out-of-the-box audio recording solutions. SabineTek’s proprietary acoustic communication technology can be widely used in headset, microphone, sound card, and speaker equipment by connecting to mainstream smart systems. Its own branded products such as SMIC, SOLO KTV earphones, FMike, SmartMike+, AudioWow, and Finalace are consistent winners at CES—the world’s leading consumer electronics event—winning CES Innovation Awards in 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021.  Innovators and rigorous engineers by day, but avid musicians by night. Can you guess who wins the annual karaoke contest during the office Christmas party?  With impeccable R&D, supply chain, and e-commerce in Asia and marketing teams in China, Europe, and the US, SabineTek has positioned itself as a global leader that seamlessly commercializes innovative technology into consumer products that meet emerging global trends and sell directly to customers. This is our third crowdfunding campaign, after SmartMike+ and Audiowow have successfully shipped to backers across the world. We've already made pre-production samples and our factory is ready to roll as soon as the campaign is over.",39.0,2,"4 Campaigns

<p>You probably didn't know that many of these critters make amazing sounds. And that 90% of these sounds remain unknown to science.</p>

<p>When I heard that people only know 10% of the sounds audible in your average pond, I decided to figure out how to manufacture a less expensive, contact-based hydrophone that the little kid in all of us could use to explore this nearby audible world.</p>
<p>I would like to see <strong>hundreds of citizen science explorers out there collecting these sounds</strong>, isolating the best ones and sharing them online with each other, making music out of them, enjoying the mysteries in our backyards.</p>
<p>The Aquabeat is priced reasonably enough so many people can afford them. All you need to use it is a small audio recorder (TASCAM DR-05 or Zoom H2N for example), and headphones or a portable speaker to enjoy.</p>

<h3>Where Are These Hydrophones Made?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>These hydrophones are being manufactured in China with the assistance of Gejing Jiang, who has made the ESunPride underwater speakers I have used to make music with whales for years. He graduated from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, and previously worked as an engineer of the South China Sea Institute of Oceanography, the Chinese Academy of Sciences. </p>
<p>The hydrophones are being manufactured by Shenzhen Xinyatu Sound Electronics Co., Ltd. in Guangdong Province, China . Their major products are piezoelectric elements, and they have 140 employees.</p>
<p>The first shipment of Aquabeats has already arrived, here's what they look like:</p>

When Model X is taken out of the charging case, it turns on automatically.
Model X then automatically enters pairing mode, discoverable from Bluetooth source device around.
When Model X is put back inside the charging case, it automatically disconnects from the source device and turns off.
 We have been developing some of the highest quality audio for more than 4 years, ranging from full-range dynamic drivers, balanced armatures to planar magnetic drivers.  10mm dynamic driver used in the Model X is a pinnacle of driver efficiency tuned specifically to work with its true wireless Bluetooth module at its maximum capability.  The driver inside Model X stands out largely for the following reasons:
Its circumference is 10mm, making it one of the biggest driver size fitted into a compact and ergonomic true wireless earbuds.
10mm is the ideal size of transducer to achieve high-fidelity both in terms of the sonic quality and volume output.
Its driver diaphragm is coated in graphene material, which markedly increases rigidity of the diaphragm while keeping its weight at the minimum resulting in an ultra-low distortion and a fast, transient response throughout the frequency range.
  Intuitive touch gesture control allows seamless operation of Model X and provide fluid and unobstructed user-experience.
Tap Once : Play / pause music, answer / end phone calls
Tap Twice : Previous / skip music track
Tap and Hold : Volume control
Tap Three times : Activate voice control (Siri / Google Assistant)
 True wireless solutions have been going through turbulent changes for the last 3 years.  Initial solutions have been plagued with severe drawbacks in the basic functions.  We've developed and scrapped over 10 different solutions in the course of 3 years, and finally reached the level of connection stability we were targeting with the Model X via matured Bluetooth 5.0 protocol.With Bluetooth 5.0, you get the strongest, most reliable connection and seamless connectivity between your devices. Strong connection and speed allows more detailed and robust audio fidelity transmission and zero audio-video lag.Beyond speed and strength of connectivity, Bluetooth 5.0 provides enhanced security compared to its previous versions to keep your personal information secure. Model X is a byproduct of countless designs to ensure universal fitment for various ear shapes and sizes.  The nozzle length is purposely elongated to be inserted deep into the ear canal and the round and compact earbud body allows it to fit ergonomically in the concha.Universal and ergonomic design provides numerous unique benefits that improve the user experience of Model X.  Such benefits are as followed:
Universal fitment without needing additional ear hooks or guide.
Maximum noise isolation up to 23dB from deep insertion of nozzle.
Model X is rated at IPX-5 sweatproof, ideal for most sports application.  Its ergonomic / secure-fit design combined with sweatproof capability makes Model X your perfect work-out companion.Being truly wireless means that the Model X never gets in your way, but helps you get to where you want to be. We developed Model X to have strong and secure connectivity to your device with a working distance of 35 ft, so you never drop a call, lose connection, or miss a moment.Model X uses a custom-made LDS antenna to increase bandwidth and signal reception while reducing interference and unwanted noise.  Additionally, pocket connectivity test has been performed using iPhone XS / Pixel 3 / Galaxy S9 / V40 in the front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right pockets over an extended period of time to ensure no connectivity loss occurred during normal commute. Built-in, low-noise, high sensitivity microphone with cVc noise-cancellation allows clear stereo phone calls on-the go.SoundDriver Diaphragm: GrapheneDriver Unit: 10mm Custom-Tuned Dynamic TransducerFrequency Response: 20Hz - 20kHzImpedance: 32 OhmsSensitivity: 90dB @ 1kHzProprietary Digital Signal Processing (DSP)High-Fidelity SoundPassive Noise Isolation up to 20dBConnectionsBluetooth Version: 5.0Bluetooth Protocol: HFP 1.7 / HSP 1.2 / A2DP 1.3 / AVRCP 1.6 / SPP1.2 / PBAP 1.0Supported Codec: AAC-LC / AAC / SBCTrue Wireless Stereo BluetoothUser-InterfaceCapacitive Touch Gesture ControlSupports Volume Control, Music Playback, Answer / End Call, Control Voice Assistant (Siri / Google Assistant)IPX5 SweatproofMicrophonescVc Noise Cancellation for Clear CallDual Omni-Directional MicrophonesBattery and PowerModel X with Charging Case: Up to 25 Hours Listening TimeModel X (single charge): Up to 5 Hours Listening Time @ 70% VolumeModel X has already gone through prototype stage of development and is in a pilot production stage and securing raw material.  The fund from Indiegogo will allow us to scale our production to speed up delivery lead-time of Model X. It was the respect for all musicians of the past, present and future.

Strong connection and speed allows more detailed and robust audio fidelity transmission and zero audio-video lag.Beyond speed and strength of connectivity, Bluetooth 5.0 provides enhanced security compared to its previous versions to keep your personal information secure. M5-TWS is rated at IPX-5 sweatproof, ideal for most sports application.  Its ergonomic / secure-fit design combined with sweatproof capability makes M5-TWS your perfect work-out companion. M5-TWS automatically turns on, enters pairing mode and turns off when you are done using it.
When M5-TWS is taken out of the charging case, it turns on automatically.
M5-TWS then automatically enters pairing mode, discoverable from Bluetooth source device around.
When M5-TWS is put back inside the charging case, it automatically disconnects from the source device and turns off.
   Intuitive touch gesture control allows seamless operation of M5-TWS and provide fluid and unobstructed user-experience.

And nothing should get between you and your favorite music. Not tangled cables, environmental noise, or long-wear discomfort.Introducing ZenPods, ultralight noise-canceling earbuds with True Wireless Stereo technology, bringing high-quality music and voice into your ears, no matter where you are.





When it comes to earbuds, every gram counts. ZenPods are designed for all-day comfort. Each earbud weighs just 4.2g, 22% lighter than Apple AirPods Pro. Feel the music, not the earbuds.Some earbuds start to hurt after you wear them for a while. We went through thousands of iterations to come up with a premium ergonomic design that comfortably fits in most people’s ears. Whether you’re commuting, Zooming, or working out, ZenPods were designed to stay in place with less fatigue.In a noisy environment, it can be tempting to turn up the volume on your earbuds. Experts say that this can result in discomfort and even hearing loss. ZenPods have Active Noise Cancellation technology (ANC), which can reduce ambient noise by up to 30dB. ANC is the smart way to hear what you want to hear.The built-in microphone detects and picks up the ambient sound, the advanced ANC algorithm then counters it with accurate anti-noise wave, cancelling the ambient sound by combining the ambient sound wave and anti-noise wave.Hearing is believing. ZenPods deliver a deep bass, warm midrange, and crystal-clear treble thanks to a 13mm composite dynamic driver. Fine-tuned by acoustic engineers for Hi-Fi performance, ZenPods let you hear your music the way it was meant to be heard. “Can you hear me now?” ZenPods’ noise cancellation technology works both ways. With Environment Noise Cancellation (ENC), the ambient noise from your surroundings is greatly reduced. Planes, trains, and office noise won’t stand between you and your conversation.ENC function will be activated automatically when you are having a phone call. The microphone will recognize your voice from ambient sound. Then the ENC algorithm will cancel these ambient noises and enhance your voice during your call.Active Noise Cancellation can be a little too immersive sometimes. In situations where you’re crossing a busy street or waiting for announcements at the airport, you probably don’t want to “cancel” your environment. Snap back to reality with Transparency Mode. The built-in environmental microphone will let sounds from the outside flow right in.ZenPods use Bluetooth 5.0 for a stable connection and high-speed communication. Designed for high-performance gaming and video streaming, ZenPods will lower latency to industry-leading 80ms latency when you enter mobile game, by increasing the bandwidth performance and enhancing the signal reception. You can enjoy your game or movie without the annoying latency of other wireless earbuds. ZenPods will automatically pair with your phone when you take them out of the case, another perk of using Bluetooth 5.0. No need to navigate the Bluetooth menu on your phone every time you want to use your ZenPods.Want to pair with Apple Watch? No problem. You can connect ZenPods with Apple Watch.ZenPods are  rated IPX5 for dust and water resistance. Whether you’re sweating from a workout or walking in the rain, ZenPods can handle it.Navigate your music, manage calls, and adjust your listening mode with intuitive touch controls. Triple-tap on your ZenPods to activate your phone’s voice assistant to get directions, play music, make a call, and much more. ZenPods are compatible with Siri and Google Assistant.",48.0,2,"13 Campaigns

<p><u><strong>HOW WE DESIGNED AND BROUGHT THE AVANCO HEAR TO THE WORLD</strong></u></p>
<p><strong><i><u>DESIGN</u></i></strong></p>
<p><strong>With the Avanco Hear we wanted to create Wireless Hearing Aid Earbuds that were powerful, different from everything else on the market and had lots of amazing unique functions, but still small enough so that they could fit completely into your ear.</strong></p>
<p><strong>To achieve this we studied the ear sizes of over 200 people before we came up with the Avanco Hear design</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528454341/swvlpm7mixoatypbscvs.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><u><strong>ENGINEERING PROCESS</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>With the Avanco Hear we have redefined Digital Signal Processing and produced a really powerful Audio Quad Core Computer for your ears.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each casing is manufactured using a 3 part process that uses a special Medical Grade Flexible Silicon that is designed to fit all ears. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Avanco Hear is IPX7 Waterproof.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Charging is Wireless and all connectivity is via Bluetooth.</strong></p>

The technology inside the Avanco Hear is engineered and designed to reduce power consumption by up to 65%. This means a massive boost to battery life for Voice calls, Music Streaming and everyday use.
 
THE AVANCO HEAR BRINGS YOU VOICE RECOGNITION

 
There are no buttons to press on the Earbuds as Voice recognition and your Avanco Hear App eliminate the need to touch your earbuds at all when they are in your ears.
 
THE AVANCO HEAR - THE ONLY EARBUD YOU'LL EVER NEED!
The Avanco Hear will replace your Headphones, Headsets, Earbuds and Hearing Aids.
SPEECH will be clearer
MUSIC will sound amazing
MOVIES will be engaging using your own Personal Theatre Sound System
SOUNDS in your everyday environment will have an enhanced clarity that you never thought was possible.
FUEL GUAGE IN EACH AVANCO HEAR EARBUD
Using the App you will always know how much charge is in your Avanco Hear Earbuds.
If your charge level goes below 10%, a Voice Alarm will tell you to re-charge your Avanco Hear earbuds.

HOW WE DESIGNED AND BROUGHT THE AVANCO HEAR TO THE WORLD
DESIGN
With the Avanco Hear we wanted to create Wireless Hearing Aid Earbuds that were powerful, different from everything else on the market and had lots of amazing unique functions, but still small enough so that they could fit completely into your ear.
To achieve this we studied the ear sizes of over 200 people before we came up with the Avanco Hear design

ENGINEERING PROCESS
With the Avanco Hear we have redefined Digital Signal Processing and produced a really powerful Audio Quad Core Computer for your ears.
Each casing is manufactured using a 3 part process that uses a special Medical Grade Flexible Silicon that is designed to fit all ears. 
Each Avanco Hear is IPX7 Waterproof.
Charging is Wireless and all connectivity is via Bluetooth.
 
THE AVANCO HEAR - THE FUTURE OF WIRELESS EARBUD TECHNOLOGY
We firmly believe that the Avanco Hear stands out in the Hearing Aid & Earbud markets - there is nothing out there like it!

</div></div>","Made for those who want to envelop themselves in the rich and vibrant experience of multidimensional sound, Edifier's new NeoBuds Pro feature innovative acoustic technology that digitally returns sound with the highest fidelity ever achieved by a pair of wireless earphones.
 
 
 

The NeoBuds Pro are the first True Wireless Stereo earbuds to achieve Hi-Res Audio certification. Expertly tuned by our world-class acoustics team to deliver professional studio-grade sound, the NeoBuds Pro reach a frequency response of 40KHz, to perform extreme audio quality like no other in-ear device has ever done before.
 
 
 Edifier leverages the innovative digital Active Crossover technology to process sound through a bi-amping with DSP based active crossover—a custom-designed dynamic driver captures exceptionally deep bass, while the Knowles balanced armature achieves pure highs, to blow you away with an acoustic experience that borders on perfection.
 
 
 It's silence that makes sound absolute. To bring you the ultimate audio experience, Edifier designed the NeoBuds Pro with intelligent active noise cancellation (ANC) algorithms that remove surrounding noise up to 42dB, while standard earbuds only go up to 30dB. Choose from a high/comfortable mode to adjust your ANC preference, and get ready to hear your music all the way through.
 
 
 Two microphones to capture your voice during phone calls may be enough, but it's the third that makes all the difference! With a total of six built-in microphones, three per earbud, the NeoBuds Pro use four microphones to direct your voice when you're on the phone, filtering it out of surrounding noise. The two additional microphones are specifically designed to suppress wind noise, adding an extra layer of crystal-clear quality to the conversations that matter most.
 
 

 
 






 
 
 
 


Connect, interact and update your NeoBuds Pro with our Edifier App, and get full control of your audio performance right at your fingertips. Choose from four sound modes: High/Low ANC, Ambient Sound and Standard, or adjust your listening preferences by customizing the EQ and other parameters.At Edifier, we have developed our digital sound algorithms to deliver a quality of sound you've probably never experienced before.
 
  With unique wireless technology, NeoBuds Pro provide up to 24 hours* of continuous playback of your favorite music. The NeoBuds Pro are your everyday, all-day ear companions.
 
  Both the NeoBuds Pro and their case support fast charging speed. Plug them in for just ten minutes and enjoy over an hour of music!
 
  When it comes to gaming and entertainment, reactivity is the key! With our Gaming Mode, the latency boasted by NeoBuds Pro is reduced to as little as 80ms, so you can hear what you see as fast as the real thing.  
 
 Edifier always aims for the best, and not just in design. When it comes to data transmission and processing, NeoBuds Pro boast among the highest standards on the market for the TWS industry.1. The Low-Latency High-Definition Audio Codec (LHDC) delivers higher resolution Bluetooth audio streaming.2. Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) enables lossless digital compression of audio beyond the MP3 standard.3. Low-Complexity Subband Codec (SBC) seamlessly transfers data to Bluetooth audio output devices such as headphones or speakers.
 
  With ear tips specially designed to prevent bacterial growth caused by daily wear-and-tear, NeoBuds Pro can maintain a sanitation rate of up to 99.8%, ensuring the health of your ears no matter how often you use NeoBuds Pro.
 
 
 NeoBuds Pro are IP54 certified for maximum durability and protection. Our designers and engineers have found the right balance to bring powerful, high-res sound, even in challenging weather conditions.
 
 
 With an ultra-secure fit and a lightweight, functional design, our earbuds make high-resolution listening an all-around comfortable experience anytime throughout your day. The NeoBuds Pro  will fit your lifestyle flawlessly to let you do everything you love to the fullest.  
 
 
 We designed the NeoBuds Pro case with a brushed aluminium panel and a front LED stripe that dynamically blinks when opened or while charging. Wear your NeoBuds Pro and buckle up, your exploration of infinitive sound is about to begin.

Therefore, using tripods or stabilizers when recording is highly recommended for keeping the phone out or interference. ※ DirectionalityEach 10mm cardioid high sensitivity condenser mic can pick up sound from a particular area which reduces the pickup of unwanted sounds remarkably, other than omnidirectional mics which capture audio in every direction.Aligned with the dual rotatable microphone design, RHK26 performs perfectly in creating a pleasant sense of width.Perfect for multiple-sound scenarios, such as interviews and meetings.※ Long Distance Voice PickupCollect clear sound from a maximum distance of 9 meters.Perfect for recording in large conference rooms and lecture rooms. ※ No suffer from low-battery anxietyYou don't need to wait for the phone to be fully charged, or stop all the work when the phone is needed to be charged.Just charge your phone through the charging port at the bottom.It is MFi certified with a guarantee of safe and effective charging. We take a bold step of integrating a pre-set modes function in RHK26 for quick-start demands.  Why not trying to get rid of the annoying and complicated tuning process on some applications?Listen to the record and the differences of different modes.

Designed to fit any showerhead, it's also made from 100% recycled ocean plastic. We're listening to more content at home than ever before. If you're like us, you've got music and podcasts streaming at all hours. But there's one place in the house that's tough to get good sound — the shower. Existing waterproof speakers just don't cut it. So, we made a speaker that you'll love using in the shower, every day.Say hello to Shower Power Shine — the LED light edition. Unlocked as one of our stretch goals, we will now offer this version of Shower Power in our rewards or any existing backer can upgrade for just an additional $29 via our add-ons. While the final design of this edition is in its final stages, here's a glimpse of what it may look like. And now for a serious question...Who's ready to make shower raves a thing?   Our Hydropower speaker was designed to never leave you without music in the bathroom. Once installed, Shower Power never needs to be removed. And that's all thanks to our proprietary hydropower system. Our hydropower system works like a water wheel in a dam. Before the flow from your shower reaches the showerhead, it rotates an internal impeller, which is connected to a mini-generator that charges a battery. The moment water starts to flow, Shower Power starts to charge.Want to really get into the weeds about how hydropower works? Check out our FAQ section to deep dive.  Shower Power automatically turns on when the water flow starts. It uses Bluetooth to connect to your device, so all you need to worry about is what podcast you're going to listen to next. Our proprietary “sound wave” diffuser sends sound in all directions for a 360-degree immersive audio experience, despite the small size. Brushing your teeth at the sink and want a little extra sound in the bathroom? We created an extra mini Bluetooth waterproof speaker that pairs with Shower Power. So you can create a surround sound system in your bathroom.As well as using renewable energy to power it, Shower Power is also made with 100% recycled ocean plastic. And in 2020, we made it our mission to eliminate single-use plastic from our packaging too. Our end goal is to make more sustainable tech products throughout the product development process — from idea through mass production. We kept this goal in mind when we designed Shower Power. So, it was important for us to select our materials thoughtfully and carefully. We worked with RTP to develop a plastic compound that was made from 100% recycled ocean plastic, which uses 15 recycled bottles in every speaker. Not only that, but it had to be engineered to work in the shower — so it’s super durable and also 99.9% antimicrobial.The minimalist and elegant design comes in three colors — crisp white, matte black and chrome. The colors will be unlocked as the campaign grows. See our initial stretch goals of their timeline (final goals to be confirmed in the first week of the campaign).     Shower Power has been designed to fit on any showerhead (in any country), including fixed, handheld, and rain. So you don't need to worry about a complicated installation. And, once in place, it does not affect shower pressure or water usage.

It has a built-in battery so you can play it at home or on the go. You will be making music within minutes with the same ease of clicking away on a keyboard.BuildBuild your BeatBox from the ground up/from scratch. BeatBox comes un-assembled as we believe making it is 50% of the fun itself! There’s no soldering involved. Everything is either quick connection or screwed on! LearnLearn to create and play your own songs. The best way to learn the BeatBox is hands-on through tutorials on our music production app. 4 integrated tutorials for 4 different styles of music with video instructions will be in the BeatBox app, including live performance tutorials for each, so you can finally flex on your friends with ease. CreateCreate your own fire beats! No need to purchase another DAW for this controller. With the BeatBox app, you can create custom beats on-the-go using your smartphone.    Music is the gift that keeps on giving. We all listen to it, tap our feet to it and groove to it, but not all of us play it.Playing music can be as rewarding as it is challenging. For many, it has taken years of blood, sweat, and tears. That’s why many people are put off by the thought of starting to learn and make music, but with BeatBox, we’ve created a way for you to enjoy music with a push of a button. In a world where only 20% of children learn music and 70% of adults wished they could play, it’s time to jump into the excitement of music and leave your doubts at the door. Do-It-YourselfThe BeatBox gives true meaning to ‘DIY music’. With the build-it-yourself aspect, it is the perfect choice for established and aspiring music makers. Ever tried building a DIY electronics kit and be like, “what now” afterward? Compared to most DIY projects on the market, the Beatbox has more use-value after creation. The BeatBox is an approachable MIDI controller intended to make music production a fun activity for everyone. It is great for a beginner because there is no need to get anything else to get started! Hardware and Software In OneMost MIDI controllers on the market require you to purchase additional software in order to use it. This software can be expensive and confusing to navigate. If you don’t have access to or understand the setup process of a DAW, it can leave you unsure where or how to begin. With BeatBox, we are also giving you the software you need to use it so all you have to do is simply connect to your smartphone to make music. There is no need to break the bank to make beats. If you happen to already have software that you love, you can still use the BeatBox because the BeatBox is compatible with most third party DAWs. Portable and ConvenientThe BeatBox gives you the option to experience both a traditional bedroom studio setup like, and a “live performance” component that’s been missing from the music production world. You can take your beats and perform anywhere. Trust us, nothing draws as big of a crowd as live produced electronic music. 
The BeatBox gives ‘DIY music” a true meaning. With its makeshift creation, it’s the perfect choice for beginners interested in STEM, coding, and music. BeatBox takes the serious, professional identity of a midi controller and turned to make beats more of a fun activity to engage in for everyone. It’s the all-in-one solution for an entry-level player, there’s no need to get anything else!The ordinary beat-making device requires you to use a laptop or desktop computer to run a DAW to produce music. If you do not have access to a computer or familiar with using DAWs, you will have difficulty learning to create music. Standalone MIDI drum machines are available on the market but are rather expensive. With Beatbox, you simply connect to your smartphone to make music.Compared to traditional bedroom studio on a laptop setup, the Beatbox gives you more of a “live performance” component that’s been traditionally missing from the music producer world, take your beats and perform anywhere, like those guys with acoustic guitars on a college campus (but cooler).  You don’t have to splurge on expensive software to use the BeatBox because we’ve made a smartphone app that has everything you need. It comes preloaded with a full library of sounds for you to play with. We’ve also included a number of tutorials to get you comfortable with using the BeatBox. Each button on the box can be mapped to the note, beat, or sample you want. You can layer a high-hat, kick and snare over any song, or you can create a completely original melody. The possibilities are endless. In the BeatBox app, you can load up samples either from your local or cloud storage, edit/rearrange the samples, record/playback, arrange a track with the built-in 16 step sequencer, mix audio between 4 channels per project, create a quick loop with our 4 layer looper function, and more! We are always coming up with new ideas and features to implement in the app and with your help, we’ll be able to develop it even further.The Beatbox is fully MIDI mappable, meaning that it will work with most of the DAW software on the market. The hardware also has a few built-in MIDI settings for popular DAWs on the market for better workflow. We are also working on a controller editor software that lets you come up with a firmware MIDI setting that makes the most sense for your workflow. 
We know, we know, up until this point we’ve only been talking about beginners; but the BeatBox offers something unique to the professional producers too. Or, if you are a beginner dreaming of going pro, the BeatBox is a piece of gear that can grow with you.Check out what the one-and-only, Austin Texas native, very talented, our #1 collaborator Flobama has to say about the BeatBox.  3 Colorways to choose fromFrom Left to Right - The OG, Bubblegum, and Rhythmo Technics.The original cardboard BeatBox is a great way to not only express your creativity through music, but also design. Create your own BeatBox design and fill it with color, doodles, graphics, stickers and more. We can’t wait to see what you will come up with. Make sure to show off your designs and send them to us!  We are also giving away access to the box’s flat cutout file and 3D stl file for laser cutting and 3D printing.

</div></div></figure></div></div>","The world of digital multi-effects and simulators has managed to offer great sounds in the past decade. But it still imposes a lot of limitations on how guitarists can assemble their setups. Unless you want to spend thousands of dollars or go around with devices that are immense. The new MOD Dwarf offers unprecedented patching freedom, new plugins for download every month, and plenty of power to use as many simultaneous plugins as you want. This is an open platform for effects, amp simulations, cabinets, virtual instruments, synthesizers, and MIDI utilities and everything else you would like to install and bring along with you inside a standalone device.  
 
 
 This is our third-product. MOD created the MOD Duo, the MOD Duo X. Now we are excited to introduce the product we always wanted to make. The MOD Dwarf completely changes the game:
It facilitates access to open-source technology
It allows bringing plugins to gigs in a stage-ready, very compact box. 
It transforms this experience, already present in MOD products, much cheaper than we were able to provide until this point.
 

 
 
 There are thousands of developers around the world working on great-sounding open-source plugins. It turns out that most musicians never get to know about it. MOD has established a bridge by curating these digital creations and making them available for everyone. This is the first time musicians and developers have a rock-solid dedicated platform to connect them.  
 
 The MOD Plugin Shop offers more than 300 hundred plugins ready to download with one click. We are constantly updating the offer so users have access to the best sounds and new effects, virtual instruments and utilities every month. Apart from that, new creations are always brewing in the backroom from the MOD Plugin Shop in a place for the braves and adventurers called MOD Labs.  
  MOD LABS: ENTIRE GALAXIES OF PLUGINS ON YOUR HANDS This is a place for the braves. A place for cultivating sonic experiments. The MOD Labs houses open-source plugin development, Arduino-based hardware creation, and beta tester programs. But you don't need to be a creative coder to explore these lands. Any user can easily opt-in to delve into more 400 plugins hosted inside the MOD Labs and take their sound ambitions to new realms of experimentation. THE PEDALBOARD FEED The Pedalboard feed is a user-friendly solution to share your patches with the MOD community without having to export files. Just click the share buttons, record a quick sound and it's done. You can even upload your patches in incognito mode, and use the URL to keep your patches safe on the cloud or share it only with your friends. Feeling curious about what other users are creating with their MOD products. Just access the feed and download patches that self-assemble inside your MOD Dwarf in seconds. 
 
 Inside the tough enclosure, the MOD Dwarf houses a Quad-core 64 bit ARM CPU running at 1.3GHz , with 8 gb storage, and 1 gb RAM. This allows you to run several plugins simultaneously, including those that demand more CPU, such as pitch-shifters. Try to find a competitor at this price point that can run nine pitch-shifters at the same time. Of course, you can save hundreds of patches inside the MOD Dwarf. But if you prefer, just throw all your favorite plugins in one board and play around with a truly multi-purpose, without having to worry about anything else. More power also means ultra high-fidelity to model analog circuitry, high-quality amps, convolution cabsims, convolution reverbs and polyphonic synths. We've created a beast that can go with you everywhere.  
  This has been a key topic around multi-fx units: how many plugins can you use simultaneously and in which way can you patch them? We don't want to join the discussion, so we simply allow you to decide for yourself. Without imposed restrictions. CREATE PATCHES ON THE FLY 
 Assemble patches from the device with only a couple of clicks and spins. Three system-dedicated push-buttons and the shift button allow for easy navigation and editing. Or open the graphical interface from any tablet, smartphone or computer to createcomplex rigs.  THE GRAPHICAL INTERFACE 
 With an intuitive drag & drop system, nailing your sound was never so easy and fun.  MOD's matchless graphic interface opens allows for as many parallel paths as you want. Duplicate, join or feedback signals. Everything is possible. Color-coded cables help you keep track of your audio, midi and internal-CV signals even on the most complex scenarios. Everything can be assigned to controllers on the device.  Enjoy the truly modular DNA only the MOD Dwarf has to offer. 
 
 MADE IN GERMANY As prices drop, a lot of the music gear out there has become more fragile. Some of the best-sellers multi-fx have quirked lines, slightly bent knobs, and sloppy overall finishing. The MOD Dwarf will be made in Germany, carefully produced at the highest standards, and resistant enough to withstand thousands and thousands of gigs. 
 THE ENCLOSURE Monolithic die-cast aluminum enclosure with laser engraving. The body is one single piece of metal, without openings or folded metal sheets. We don't play with plastic. This strong shell is powder-coated in black, offering the highest resistance against scratches, dents and absolutely no chance for paint flaking. THE KNOBS We think of knobs as science. Really. Knobs are too important to use shelf alternatives. That's why every MOD device has knobs designed from scratch. The knurled surface will remain present to allow better grip, as the encoders will present an optimum degree of resistance for enhanced precision. Needless to say, you can address any parameter you want to your knobs. This is a MOD device, after all. THE FOOTSWITCHES The MOD Dwarf footswitches are soft-touch, momentary, non-latching pieces. While common latching footswitches are necessarily toggled, on this type of footswitch all the activation is decided via software. This makes it extremely flexible for different functions such as toggle, list navigation, trigger, bypass, push and hold or tap. We've been using the same footswitches model for the last 5 years These are from CSI, the same brand used by MXR and other brands recognized by having long-lasting products. LONG-LASTING DESIGN Enclosures, knobs, and footswitches are made of aluminum rather than plastic. The components in all MOD Devices are designed to be resistant to time and rough use. 
 
 The MOD plugin shop offers more than 300 free plugins ready for download. You don't need to scroll through file lists in download sections from websites, neither install drivers or firmware updates. Everything happens inside the browser-based interface. Just click on the Plugin Shop and get your plugins with one single click.
 
Play with the classics or experiment with innovative new creations from developers all around the world. We are constantly polishing new plugins and making them available every month.
 Load your own Impulse Responses: Apart from the large collections of high-quality impulse responses built in the MOD cabinets, the Dwarf allows you to load your own IR via a newly developed file-handling system. Just plug the Dwarf yo your computer or use a USB stick to transfer your IR files and use an IR Cabinet shell to bring your favorite tones everywhere. WHY OPEN-SOURCE PLUGINS The way we see it, manufacturers should not be the only detainers of the power to choose what users can or cannot have access to. There's an open-world out there, populated by plugins of great quality created by talented developers. We want to open the gates to this world, so everyone can enter and make use of it. That's why MOD products run LV2 plugins, a modern, open and extensible plugin standard designed for real-time operation. CREATE YOUR OWN EFFECTS WITH MAX/MSP Oh yes, you can do that too! We offer an integration developed together with Cycling 74, which allows anyone to create plugins with the Max environment. Export your own plugins in gen~ and use it on your gigs inside the MOD Dwarf. Oh, and we offer an SDK builder that you can use to create a graphical interface in a couple of minutes. 
 The high-quality AD-DA circuitry provides an audio-interface quality level rarely found in mass-market digital sound processors. AUDIO-INTERFACE Yes, the MOD Dwarf works as an audio interface. But it also does much more than that. The audio-over-USB function allows you to route your signal with or without processing it by your patches, as well as to manage physical and virtual I/O. And that's not only for audio. The MOD Dwarf also allows bidirectional MIDI via USB, which you can address to a specific or to the MIDI aggregator. As a class-compliant audio and MIDI devices, the MOD Dwarf is compatible with leading DAWs and plugins:  
 
 

 
 
  
 TEACHERS LOVE MOD DEVICES “The MOD has almost entirely ended the need for dragging around a large pedalboard. With endless customization possibilities, Midi functionality, looping capability, it has become the go-to processor for all areas of my playing, practicing and teaching”.- Dan Bowden, Professor of the Guitar Department at Berklee College of Music ""Incredibly exciting! There's a game element to MOD. It's freedom in a box!"" - Katarina Tigerlight, Effects Instructor at BIMM 
 We are based in Berlin and have talented individuals working from the Netherlands, France, the USA, and Brazil. We created the MOD Duo and the MOD Duo X. These products are used by thousands of musicians and have been praised by several publications and Youtube creators. But we had a consistent piece of feedback: not everyone could afford those products, and to really offer freedom to everyone, we needed to create something more affordable. That's why we decided to kick off the development of the product we always wanted to create. That's the MOD Dwarf. A compact and powerful solution that is much more affordable than any other unit in the market with similar capabilities. It is possible to offer cutting-edge technology at decent prices. If you believe in that premise as much as we do, please help us to make it happen. WE HAVE PARTNERED UP WITHOUR PRODUCTSMOD Duo  Our first products produced on a large scale, The Duo inaugurated the MOD platform and drove the evolution of our open-software mindset. MOD Duo X  Created after we recognized the necessity of a tabletop solution with more controls, for several of our users who loved the MOD Duo to produce and perform electronic music.   MOD Footswitch The MOD Footswitch seamlessly connects to your MOD devices to extend the actuators you can use to control your effects.

RISK AND CHALLENGES



 
As this is our second crowdfunding endeavor, many ""rookie mistakes"" that could compromise the fulfillment of the campaign have already been addressed. Before launching the crowdfunding phase of the MOD Dwarf, the company has successfully conducted a crowd investment campaign at Seedmatch - https://www.seedmatch.de/investmentchancen/modd... - in order to guarantee to have the necessary funds for the process. In terms of manufacturing, this is our third product and, since the 2014 MOD Duo campaign, we have been building solid relationships with reliable manufacturing partners. Nevertheless, out-of-our-control situations like the one recently caused by the Coronavirus can cause delays that are to be avoided but always possible. Our delivery date of December 2020 is still achievable, even with the Coronavirus pandemic impacts. If there is a recrudescence of the situation we will inform all campaign backers accordingly. Last but not least, the software development is on a safe track.

This can be a way to draft songs before hiring a real person to sing them, but vocal synthesizers are more often used to feature on songs, giving the songwriter more creative freedom and flexibility not available in a real voice. Synthesizer V Studio is a vocal synthesizer that excels in realism and expressiveness, especially with its AI capabilities, and offers unmatched opportunities for user control with a focus on ease of use that makes it unique among competitors. Synthesizer V allows users to purchase vocals of their choosing in a variety of languages, tones, and vocal ranges, including both standard style and AI powered voices. Synthesizer V’s AI vocals are unique in how quickly they process changes, and how realistic their results can be while still maintaining a high level of user control and input.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619314141/idxk9ivzt5ogiqjl6n4b.png"" src=""""/></p><p>SOLARIS is an AI voice library that we at Eclipsed Sounds, LLC are creating for the vocal synthesis program Synthesizer V Studio by Dreamtonics Co., Ltd.

Be sure to pledge for any crowdfund-limited items before it ends, and thank you so much for your support!This campaign accepts external contributions for contributors who cannot process payments through Indiegogo. Please see the Updates tab for more information on contributing through these means. According to the terms of service, these funds cannot be contributed into the Indiegogo campaign pool of funding, so this page will be frequently updated to show current growth. Similar to how text-to-speech is used to have your computer “read words aloud,” vocal synthesizers let you write music and have your computer “sing” it. This can be a way to draft songs before hiring a real person to sing them, but vocal synthesizers are more often used to feature on songs, giving the songwriter more creative freedom and flexibility not available in a real voice. Synthesizer V Studio is a vocal synthesizer that excels in realism and expressiveness, especially with its AI capabilities, and offers unmatched opportunities for user control with a focus on ease of use that makes it unique among competitors. Synthesizer V allows users to purchase vocals of their choosing in a variety of languages, tones, and vocal ranges, including both standard style and AI powered voices. Synthesizer V’s AI vocals are unique in how quickly they process changes, and how realistic their results can be while still maintaining a high level of user control and input.SOLARIS is an AI voice library that we at Eclipsed Sounds, LLC are creating for the vocal synthesis program Synthesizer V Studio by Dreamtonics Co., Ltd. SOLARIS will be an English vocal recorded by pop artist Emma Rowley. The SOLARIS vocal product is represented by the character “SOLARIS,” whose mature and powerful design is inspired by the theme of a sun goddess. SOLARIS is meant to represent the limitless possibility of a singer “at your fingertips.” What can I do with SOLARIS?With SOLARIS, you can:
Create original, expressive English singing vocals without hiring a singer
Have access to a vocalist for any lyrics and melody you can imagine
Make detailed drafts for a human vocalist so you don't need multiple takes to get it right
Change any aspect of your created vocals, from breathiness to intensity
Currently, there is only one other native English language vocal available for Synthesizer V. With the SOLARIS project, we intend to expand the options available on this engine for the vast community of English language vocal synthesis users and extend the reach of Synthesizer V outside of the existing vocal synthesis landscape. With your contributions, SOLARIS will become a reality and open the door for more English language Synthesizer V singers.Vocal synthesizer development is expensive. Up until now, everything for the SOLARIS project has been funded out of pocket by our team members. In order to complete this project, we need to attain funding from outside sources. Given the nature of the vocal synthesis community, we felt that the best way to create SOLARIS would be to harness the passion that fans and vocal synthesis users have shown overwhelmingly in the past. With your support, the SOLARIS project can be realized.INITIAL GOAL: $40,000If we reach our initial funding goal of $40,000, we will be able to:
Create the SOLARIS AI English library for Synthesizer V Studio in conjunction with Dreamtonics. An AI library will allow for expressive, realistic vocals to be produced that can suit any needs of the user
Pay our vocalist, recording artist and former Broadway performer Emma Rowley, for her time and recordings involved in this project.
Produce beautiful, detailed key artwork for the SOLARIS project with talented illustrator Superstellar
Produce the crowdfund rewards, including paying the guest artists like Edlinklover, MystSaphyr, and staySOCKY who worked with us, paying for manufacturing, packaging, shipping rewards to their final destinations
Commission original demonstration songs from skilled vocal synthesis users such as VocaCircus/Circus-P and GHOST who have already signed on to work on demonstration pieces.
STRETCH GOAL: $55,000Additional funding will go towards:
Improving the quality of SOLARIS’ singing capabilities with more AI training data, allowing for alternate pronunciation selections, clearer performance at difficult pitches, and an overall improvement to tone and realism
Additional key artworks such as a full reference sheet for the SOLARIS character, and artwork for an alternate design for SOLARIS
 Incomplete FundingIf we are not fully funded, we will try to come up with the remaining necessary funds on our own to complete the SOLARIS project. This will result in massive delays in reward fulfillment and library completion until these funds are realized, however, we will do our utmost to fulfill them and complete the project. In this scenario, we will update frequently on our status throughout this time and keep you involved via our website and social media accounts. If we are not able to come up with the remaining funds on our own within 6 months of the final day of the crowdfund, pledges will be fully returned to backers.Eclipsed Sounds, LLC is a small business focused on creating high quality English-language digital vocal instruments. We have been working for over 2 years in collaboration with Dreamtonics to bring the SOLARIS project to fruition, and so far have worked together to create a test version of SOLARIS using the standard Synthesizer V synthesis method. If you have heard of us prior to this project, we formerly produced sanctioned fan merchandise for other vocal synthesis characters, but we moved our full focus toward this project as soon as merchandise sales ended. MEET THE TEAMEclipsed Sounds Teamkhanadee (Elijah Damon) | CEO

<h3>The Wristbands:</h3>
</div><p>What you see here is the evolution of our product. We started with experimental tags which we bought from <a href=""https://mbientlab.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://mbientlab.com/</a></p><p>Our first few firmwares were designed to run on those tags and we still use them on a daily basis and until our electronic prototypes become available mid April.</p><p>In parallel we had an industrial designer design a first version of the wristband and PCB enclosure, our first mechanical design.</p><p>Next we had our own PCB design created and with it, we had to adapt the initial mechanical design. We are now at a stage where the PCB and the mechanical design are final, and we move into prototype production.</p><p>What you can see in the following picture are various stages of our development. </p><p>The current parts have all been 3d printed.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616421841/wetrnnibmncxdsz5lx7y.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Here you can see a screenshot from our GERBER files, it shows our final PCB design.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616421886/ldiue8fxu743ycgchgal.png"" src=""""/></p><p>In the following picture you can see screenshots of our final mechanical design, with the PCB sitting in the PCB enclosure.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616421911/upotxyhub1idq9ktgsqk.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616421937/ip6wdje2z4vz100jenqh.png"" src=""""/></p><p>As soon as we get the electronic prototypes we will place them into 3d printed PCB enclosures. This will help us make sure that the mechanical parts and the PCB fit tightly together. Once done, we will move into production with the mechanical parts, which we expect for mid June. </p><p> </p><h3>The App:</h3><p>Below is a supplementary video that clearly shows our current prototype's functionality and demonstrates the range of features which will be available upon release: </p><div><div>

Mictic is the Swiss-made Interactive Audio AR wearable that turns your movements into sound. It doesn’t matter if you already have a Grammy or have never picked up a musical instrument, with Mictic you’ll be expressing yourself the minute you put the wristbands on and connect via Bluetooth. We’re inviting the Indiegogo community to participate in the launch of Mictic through your contributions (and by being among the first to put on the wristbands when we release a limited first run in September). We’ve worked with major label artists and professional dancers in every genre to get here. But now we want to see what you’ll do with it out in the real world -- You the unruly, untamable public.  How: We’ve packed centuries of Swiss engineering into Mictic and brought it into the digital era. And are the first wearable device that is a true musical instrument and not just a controller for Midi or other interfaces. The wristbands use our to translate your arm movements into included instrument sounds like electric guitar, drums, cello, and genre-based soundscapes like EDM and HipHop.You can even play with our sci-fi and game experiences. More instruments and sounds will be available for upload all the time, including in partnership with artists you love.Why: We’re coming to you now because we want you to be among the first wave of Mictic users. We want real tech savvy music fans to get the first batch of the wristbands and show us, and the world, what wild and beautiful things they help you create. 
When: Contribute to our Indiegogo campaign and you’ll get the limited first run of Mictic before anyone else. Whether you perform on a stage, in a studio, or simply on TikTok, you’ll be able to incorporate Mictic into what you do before anyone else.The artist in you will love experimenting with this new musical tool with literally no rules, no one to tell you what you can’t do. How does it work?The wristbands contain sensors that detect movement and motion with supreme precision and accuracy.   You can connect the sensors with your smartphone via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Strap Mictic to your wrists  Connect your Smartphone via Bluetooth  Pair with the Mictic App Pick your Instrument or sound experience  Let the Magic happen!  All sounds from the following demo videos were recorded 100% live!A short demo video to give you a sneak peek of how our Rock Soundscape works:

The Buzz! As seen in: 

 
Mictic on the news:
Last week Mershad Javan, CEO of Mictic,  joined 'Cheddar Innovates' to discuss how this new wearable translates movement into musical tones and sound effects, and how this is going to change the way we interact with music.
Here is a short clip of the product demo - feel free to watch the whole video here!

We got featured on Mashable in their Future Blink section - a sneak peek at the innovations that will change our everyday lives in the future. 

 
Check out Mictic on Reuters TV...


 
and on BBC Turkey.

 

 
The Wristbands:
What you see here is the evolution of our product. We started with experimental tags which we bought from https://mbientlab.com/Our first few firmwares were designed to run on those tags and we still use them on a daily basis and until our electronic prototypes become available mid April.In parallel we had an industrial designer design a first version of the wristband and PCB enclosure, our first mechanical design.Next we had our own PCB design created and with it, we had to adapt the initial mechanical design. We are now at a stage where the PCB and the mechanical design are final, and we move into prototype production.What you can see in the following picture are various stages of our development. The current parts have all been 3d printed.Here you can see a screenshot from our GERBER files, it shows our final PCB design.In the following picture you can see screenshots of our final mechanical design, with the PCB sitting in the PCB enclosure.As soon as we get the electronic prototypes we will place them into 3d printed PCB enclosures. This will help us make sure that the mechanical parts and the PCB fit tightly together. Once done, we will move into production with the mechanical parts, which we expect for mid June.  The App:Below is a supplementary video that clearly shows our current prototype's functionality and demonstrates the range of features which will be available upon release: 

 
Here is a video showing the experimental version of the App a bit more in detail: 
 At the moment we are switching to the beta version which you can see in this video: The initial product launch will be available for iOS users only. But no worries as the Android version will follow very soon after.  Here is a small preview of the first iteration app design and settings!   Below a list of features which are integrated in the first app version: Instruments:- Acoustic Guitar- Electric Guitar- Cello- Drums - Violin   Soundscapes:- Hip Hop - Trap - Latin - EDM- Rock
 

Games:

</div><p>At Phazon, we believe people deserve truly wireless headphones that are both comfortable &amp; stable, have great sound quality and look good.</p><p>In designing our earbuds, we have been inspired by those two pain points:<br/>1. Inconvenience from the headphone wires, especially during sports activities.<br/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">2. While working relentlessly on the project we came up with something truly innovative:</span></p><p><b>Phazon is making the world’s first one-size-fits-all wireless earbuds - guaranteed not to fall off.</b></p><p>Wireless earbuds have been around recently. However, they offer very poor comfort and stability. While they claim that inserts (plastic or foam) can fix the problems, we know it won’t. Have you already tried earbuds with inserts? It just doesn’t work well in an active environment. We plan to change all that with our product and patent pending form factor. That’s right, with a simple twist motion, everyone gets a snug fit with only 1 size and 0 inserts.</p><p>How is our one-size-fits-all earbuds different from any other product? Knowing that there is an inner ear pattern that everyone shares, we made many iterations to find our fit. With our twist motion, the fit is so solid that you can literally dive into the water and it will stay in place. It's a completely snug fit. Any sports from casual jogging to skydiving will let you listen to music flawlessly.</p><p>In the wireless earbud industry, it’s critical to have that great snug fit. After all, you surely don’t want to lose your earbuds while playing sports!</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479924296/xpxvgikosjhbcbp3hcil.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479924341/k0vky6mpojvgy4qffcua.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479941787/uyfp965ouk8yo34oaehb.png"" src=""""/></p><div><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479941807/uhdhwoa6di0jhemzj2ai.png"" src=""""/></div><div> </div><div><b>COLOR SELECTION: You'll be prompt to choose your color shortly after purchase</b></div><p><br/><b><b>THIS IS WHAT YOU'LL GET IF YOU PLEDGE NOW</b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449022159/o9vbuxffrtcibm3qnyqp.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449179268/ry1idrulxsfow2cbxfrs.png"" src=""""/></p><p>You'll also be able to download our free mobile app!</p><p> </p><h4>We've reached 4 stretch goals so a big THANK YOU ;)<br/><br/><b>1st Strech goal: Midnight blue color</b>

<p>The exciting and innovative concept of the Phazon wireless earbuds surfaced in March 2014. Chris had become frustrated with his gym experience due to the constant encumbrance of his earbuds. The earbud wires would always get tangled, fall out of his ears or detach from his music player. The constant interruption proved to be of significant annoyance, so he sought a solution to his problem.</p>
<p>Looking for an immediate solution he went on to look for an earbud that had Bluetooth connectivity, a good fit and sleek design. Upon doing online research he found that none of his three basic needs would be met by any current product.</p>
<p>At this point, new team members joined in, as they began researching and developing this new technology; an innovative take on the Bluetooth system was developed. Meanwhile, Chris started looking to build the world’s most comfortable and stable earbud by doing lots of iterations with the help of an industrial designer. The entire concept is something truly innovative to the everyday consumer. The product concept was inspired by the gap in the current global marketplace.</p>
<p>Phazon has a very simple objective: provide customers with a quality listening experience that is free of constraints. This high quality experience is one of the driving forces of Phazon. The earbud itself is a compact piece of technology, which boasts a sleek design. Available in 5 different colors the earbud has a snug fit and is smaller than a quarter. Using innovative methods the company has been able to shape the earbud so that it would comfortably fit without causing pressure to the user or fall out. Phazon currently has a utility patent pending on both the fit and design aspects. As a wireless device, it connects via Bluetooth to any nearby music player with supporting software, such as standard smartphones.</p> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479942486/lfu8tflcjz6dt43oxrva.png"" src=""""/></p>

</div></div>","At Phazon, we believe people deserve truly wireless headphones that are both comfortable & stable, have great sound quality and look good.In designing our earbuds, we have been inspired by those two pain points:1. Inconvenience from the headphone wires, especially during sports activities.2. While working relentlessly on the project we came up with something truly innovative:Phazon is making the world’s first one-size-fits-all wireless earbuds - guaranteed not to fall off.Wireless earbuds have been around recently. However, they offer very poor comfort and stability. While they claim that inserts (plastic or foam) can fix the problems, we know it won’t. Have you already tried earbuds with inserts? It just doesn’t work well in an active environment. We plan to change all that with our product and patent pending form factor. That’s right, with a simple twist motion, everyone gets a snug fit with only 1 size and 0 inserts.How is our one-size-fits-all earbuds different from any other product? Knowing that there is an inner ear pattern that everyone shares, we made many iterations to find our fit. With our twist motion, the fit is so solid that you can literally dive into the water and it will stay in place. It's a completely snug fit. Any sports from casual jogging to skydiving will let you listen to music flawlessly.In the wireless earbud industry, it’s critical to have that great snug fit. After all, you surely don’t want to lose your earbuds while playing sports!   COLOR SELECTION: You'll be prompt to choose your color shortly after purchaseTHIS IS WHAT YOU'LL GET IF YOU PLEDGE NOWYou'll also be able to download our free mobile app! We've reached 4 stretch goals so a big THANK YOU ;)1st Strech goal: Midnight blue color
 2nd Strech goal: Equalizer app But wait, what is an EQUALIZER?In simple terms: it enhances the sound, based on your favorite music style. So let's say you like rap music, the equalizer will boost the bass. If you like classic music, it will boost the treble.3rd Strech goal: Battery indicator + T-Shirts giveawayBeside than having a simple native battery display on your phone, we'll also implement a more accurate battery level indicator in our app. Because many people wear t-shirts when they workout, well, why not a free Phazon t-shirt (Superpowers included)! 4th Strech goal: Sunset colorThe Sunset color is finally available! The earbuds require a simple connection with any Bluetooth device, such as a smartphone.... and a smartwatch!

 


  
Sound quality is a BIG priority for us – obviously! That’s why from the beginning we consulted with a world renowned sound specialist. With his advice, we not only choose the best electronic components when designing the product, but also the optimal way to have great sound.
With our dynamic driver, you can expect excellent all around sound from bass to treble, as opposed to balanced armature driver. You can experience the best bass sound quality on the truly wireless earbuds market .
In addition, we are actually using the same speaker as major high end audio companies.
 
After consulting with top audiologists and doing multiple iterations, we found out something interesting. Combining our special form factor with a simple twist motion, everyone is having a comfortable and stable earbuds experience.Yes. It fits everyone - guaranteed - from teenagers to seniors. We agree that every ear is unique and we have found a unique way to fit them all. The inner part of the ear is basically the same for everyone, with our form factor and a simple twist motion, everyone will get a comfy and stable fit. After testing our earbuds with over 500 people, they all agreed that the fit was comfortable and stable (100%). That's why we are pretty confident in our statement.Here's is our special form factor (feel free to play around with):Still not sure of our fit? We took our earbuds for the ultimate test, check the video right below!  Our charging case can hold at least 1 extra charge for the earbuds. There is also a convenient keychain hole on top so you can easily carry it with you. You'll be able to charge the case with a micro USB. Check out below our quick demo of the charging case prototype!  Don't panic! We have an app for this!Available for iOS and Android devices! 
 

The one size fits all: A patent pending twist motion that allow the earbud to sit tightly but comfortably in your ear. Just pair it to your phone and Voilà! No apps, no wires, one button only! You use only one or both earbuds and the process is the same, with a simple push of a button you are ready to sync the earbuds to any phone with Bluetooth.

<p><strong>Q: What about left handed people, can we play it too?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes! Please select the $49 <strong>""Left Handed Rockers Unite!""</strong> Perk to reserve your left handed MI Guitar and share with other lefties that want to rock. We need 1,000 reservations to justify the engineering and tooling costs. If we receive 1,000 reservations, we will ask you to finalize your order through our perk management portal. Magic Instruments will create an order and you will receive a Purchase Agreement indicating the purchase price of the device ($299 USD), plus estimates of any applicable taxes, duties, transport and delivery charges, and any other applicable fees. If you proceed with the order, we will apply your Reservation Payment towards the order payment. Until you enter into a Purchase Agreement, your Reservation may be cancelled at any time, in which case you will receive a full refund of your Reservation Payment. If we do not collect 1,000 reservations before the end of the campaign, we will not manufacture a left handed model of the MI Guitar and refund your reservation via PayPal. This is only a reservation and you understand that we will not hold your Reservation Payment separately or in an escrow or trust fund or pay any interest on your Reservation Payment. </p>
<p><strong>Q: What if I'm a lefty, but already pre-ordered a right handed MI Guitar?</strong></p>
<p>A: The very least, you'll still get your right handed guitar. But if we can get 1,000 or more left handed rockers interested, we will ask for your preference through our perk management portal before we start manufacturing.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How do I select the color of my guitar? Are there any other colors other than black or white?</strong></p>
<p>A: We will ask for your color selection after the completion of the campaign through the perk management portal. At this time, we are only offering black and white, but may offer more colors if there is a large demand of 5,000 units or more.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why, where, and how will you be collecting sales tax?</strong></p>
<p>A: Magic Instruments is required by law to collect state sales tax for orders shipped to California, Illinois and Pennsylvania, as our company and our fulfillment partner have a physical presence in these states. For backers with shipping addresses in those states, our perk management portal will calculate sales tax and allow you to pay with any major credit card after the campaign has finished and before we ship perks to backers. Note that if we open up additional fulfillment locations in additional states, we will be required by law to charge sales tax for residents of those states.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How are you handling international orders? (Continued)</strong></p>
<p>While this Reservation secures the approximate delivery priority within your region, it does not constitute the purchase or order of Magic Instruments’ products. When the start of production for your Reservation nears, we will ask you to finalize your order. Magic Instruments will create an order and you will receive a Purchase Agreement indicating the purchase price of the device, plus estimates of any applicable taxes, duties, transport and delivery charges, and any other applicable fees. If you proceed with the order, we will apply your Reservation Payment towards the order payment. Until you enter into a Purchase Agreement, your Reservation may be cancelled at any time, in which case you will receive a full refund of your Reservation Payment. This refund policy is only valid for international backers.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How much does the MI Guitar weigh?</strong></p>
<p>A: Approximately five pounds.</p>

<h2><strong>READ ABOUT US</strong></h2>
<p>The Dreampad pillows, which use the same type of technology as the Aurras, have received rave reviews from the press.   </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1604339667/kd9aygi6sfqjvoouxohd.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>WHAT DO YOU WANT TO HEAR?</strong></h2>
<p>Aurras was designed so you can listen to anything, with the best listening experience possible. The Aurras device utilizes a built-in equalizer to optimize whatever you're listening to. Whether your bedtime or naptime routine involves music, podcasts, or audiobooks — you’ll be listening with quality and comfortability.</p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>QUALITY SOUND MADE FOR YOU</strong></h2>
<p>How can you possibly have good audio going <i>through</i> a pillow?  First, we've designed the Aurras to use bone conduction technology, which creates a unique resonance that permeates the entire pillow.</p>
<p> </p>

</div>
<p>Second, we pair the Aurras with a 1-Watt Bluetooth amplifier with a built-in equalizer to optimize the sound for what you’re listening to.  The Bluetooth amplifier includes a bass booster to provide enhanced low-end vibrations, which has been found to help support relaxation and sleep.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605278000/b7hat1cdky5zzxpvbn3m.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If your sleeping partner is the type who needs a quiet room, and your oscillating fan or audiobook is bothersome, the Aurras is the perfect solution to a comfortable sleep environment for both parties. No more bothering someone else with your audio, or waking up in the middle of the night to a missing or low battery earbud, or needing to untangle your headphone cords just to sleep in your go-to position. </p>

<p> </p>
<h2><strong>HOW DOES IT WORK?</strong></h2>
<p>The Aurras is a thin, discrete, personalized speaker for under your pillow that only you can hear.  It is designed to provide enough output to get through your pillow, but without broadcasting the sound throughout your bedroom.  </p>
<p>It's like magic, but it's science.  </p>

<p> </p>
<p>It's simple to use: </p>
<ul>
<li>Plug the aux cable into the included Bluetooth amp</li>
<li>Power on and pair to your phone</li>
<li>Choose an EQ setting - podcasts, audiobooks, or music</li>
<li>Slip the Aurras under your pillow</li>
<li>Select your content on your phone - podcast, audiobook, music, nature sounds, shows</li>
<li>Adjust the volume as needed</li>
</ul>
<p>It's as simple as that.  The Bluetooth amp has a battery and will need charging, available with the included USB charging cable.  </p>

<h2><strong>RELAX EASIER AND SLEEP BETTER</strong></h2>
<p>The Aurras and Dreampad products were designed and built with the goal of helping our customers get into a healthier sleep pattern with the most natural medicine available— sound and music. Over the years, Dreampad pillows have helped tens of thousands of people with serious sleep problems with the simple yet unique implementation of bone conduction technology.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h2><strong>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</strong></h2>
</div><div>
<p>Our biggest challenge is making sure we can finalize our first mass production batch in order to get the product to our backers before the end of the year.  This requires a big push in November, and early December.  We will be expediting the shipment for a limited quantity of Aurras to make sure they’re delivered as soon as possible. </p>
<p>Our team of audio designers has finalized the prototypes and all approvals are complete.  In order to save time and improve product quality assurance, we have procured a custom-designed test fixture to rapidly test each module.</p>

<p>We are working hard to raise a minimum of $20,000 to get us through the final stages of certification, production, quality control, packaging and shipping.  We plan to complete a specified quantity, ship by air, and then put on doorsteps, into hands, and under pillows.  Here's what we've been doing, and what we have to do, to meet these goals:</p>

<h2><strong>DREAMPAD:  PIONEERS IN MUSIC FOR SLEEP</strong></h2>
<p>The creators of Dreampad have been delivering high-quality music pillows for sleep and relaxation since 2014.  The Dreampad pillow was developed based on the idea of “bone conduction,” a discovery made by the notorious deaf composer Ludwig van Beethoven in the 18th century. In bone conduction listening, certain devices can vibrate and produce sound waves, ultimately producing a calming response in the body. Based on this therapeutic insight, the vibrational music technology was embedded into these pillows to create a relaxing and restful bedtime sound experience.</p>

<p>However, we all have that perfect pillow— the pillow that somehow manages to survive the updates in our bedding— the pillow with our personal indent in it.  The Aurras was born as the next step in the sleep sound evolution, creating beautiful, and isolated audio.</p>

Our warehouse and logistics center</i></p><p> </p><p> </p></div>","In early 2018, after testing as many wireless earbuds as we could, we found that the low priced ones had only basic features and the premium ones were very expensive.That's when we decided to set a new standard in the wireless earbuds market, developing the most thoroughly designed product, at an affordable price. Rather than focusing on a single feature and ignoring the rest, we undertook a deep development of every detail of HYPHEN.  Initially, we analysed the market to isolate the features that users cared about the most. We identified the 9 main factors and their solutions.  

Pairing and connection
Control

Sound quality
Listening distance

Ergonomic Fit


Battery Life and Portability

Design
Water Resistance
Integrated Wireless Charging

Once we made sure we could fit every feature in such a small budget, we set out to find the best suppliers for each component.We then focused on creating a team of developers composed of the most experienced engineers in the fields of bluetooth, audio quality and battery life.The following table speaks for itself:  Still absent from 99% of models on the market, wireless charging is the future of portable devices. In a product that is meant to be used everyday, we couldn’t ignore its convenience. No need to buy clumsy adaptors, Hyphen features integrated wireless charging. Of course a long battery life and portability of the device are inversely proportional. Some users value more a tiny EDC product, others prefer a longer battery life at the expense of portability. HYPHEN will let you listen for up to 28 hours in one of the smallest cases on the market. Thanks to Hyphen's fast charging technology, you will be ready to play in just 15 minutes. Right now, most wireless earbuds only offer limited control, such as play/pause or waking up a virtual assistant. HYPHEN will give you a level of control over your phone never seen before. Use our Advanced Touch Control to stay off your device.  Double tap on right earbud for next song, double tap on left earbud for previous song. Tap to answer or hang up calls. Hold on right earbud to increase volume, hold on left earbud to decrease it. Triple tap on any earbud while music is off to activate your device's virtual assistant.   In a product that sits in your ears most of the day, an awesome design is essential. After all, nobody wants to look like an alien!Our team worked on tens of different designs, taking inspiration from Swiss details care and precision, and Italian research for the relationship between man and object.We settled on a combination of organic lines and acute edges, for earbuds that are perfect from a business meeting to a run in the rain.  Being able to move and exercise without the earbuds falling off is crucial for a worry less experience. HYPHEN's shape is based on the analysis of dozens of different ear shapes, to achieve the best comfort and grip in every situation. We chose a mix of soft touch plastic and a glass like surface for a pleasant feel in the ear and in the hand.   What immediately sets cheap earbuds apart from premium ones is the quality of the audio.Thanks to the Advanced Audio Distribution Profile support, HYPHEN delivers precision-tuned sound. Our high quality speaker provides for a full-range listening experience, satisfying even at lower volumes.Hyphen’s noise isolating ergonomic tips will give you the silence needed for a crisp and clear audio delivery.  A complex pairing process is typical in earbuds that were designed with only hardware in mind. This is a common issue to both low and high priced products, and it's one of the most frustrating usability issues.With Bluetooth 5, HYPHEN will have the most reliable connection possible, for instant pairing and a seamless communication with your smartphone. This means extremely detailed sound dimensions and zero audio-video lag.Being able to freely move around the house while listening to music without carrying your smartphone is important for many users. That's why we have designed Hyphen to work flawlessly even at a distance of 15 meters (49 ft).   Never worry about damaging your HYPHEN, with an IPX5 waterproof rating you will be able to face even the worst weather conditions.

The structure and premise of this podcast is grossly under represented among podcasts, which are often just two dudes talking endlessly.
The guest catalogue is FIRE.
We won't stop developing our skill in this medium. We expect to start a little rough around the edges, and will continue polishing nonstop til our ENTIRE audience can see themselves reflected in our program.
 
Times Are Tough and Many Of Us Are Strapped
If you can't contribute a significant amount you can still help the mission by spreading the good word!

</div><p><br/> </p></div>","Mine S is a cleverly designed, intuitive modular controller that puts the power to create efficiency in your hands. Using an easy swap-in/swap-out design, you can create the controller that you need to best use the software for your music, light show, visual effects, video editing, and more. Don’t let cumbersome controllers disrupt your creative workflow, get a seamless, customized experience with Mine S.



Pick and choose which modules you need, how many, and how you want them to be configured for the perfect layout.
Designed in Italy
Self-recognition of modules (Type, orientation and position)
Protocols available: MIDI, HID, OSC, DMX, Art-Net
6 types of modules



Mine S is able to recognize the position, orientation and type of module inserted. That means it can more easily map the controller and get you started on your creative endeavor faster. Our company, Specialwaves, will also send updates for firmware and software so you’ll have the opportunity to add new features, keeping you as up to date as possible.
 





 
There are a lot of reasons why you may need a customizable and reconfigurable modular controller.

Need the perfect setup that makes sense for you
Your software works best with a particular layout
Need to switch quickly from one configuration to another
Working with a new piece or upgraded software
Changed up your workflow

Other  controllers on the market aren’t versatile enough to meet user needs. With Mine S you don’t need to buy new controllers for new tasks, simply reconfigure and you’re back to work!  Mine S is the perfect tool to work within the studio, as well as live events. It’s so compact and easy to switch up on the fly, so you’re ready to go in minutes. Want to use multiple pieces of software at the same time? No problem! Mine S can handle it with an easy interface. Mine S can even configure the module features in an advanced and precise way (i.e. linear or logarithmic curve), saving that particular configuration so you can use it later when you need it again.  Many of you are multi-talented and need diverse applications for various jobs - even for different kinds of software. Luckily the Mine S can accommodate you, controlling lights today, and your VJ set tomorrow!    Mine S is versatile enough for all preprogrammed and last minute requests. For example, you can control a music or video track before a theatre or arena event, or add one or more channels for controlling a new effect - like a fog machine -  in a live set. Your creativity knows no bounds!  With Mine S you can create a unique control surface that matches perfectly with the layout of the software are you using, eliminating user error that comes from switching back and forth from device to screen! 
 
Mine S comes with its own proprietary, intuitive Controller Editor software, which is compatible with most music, VJing, laser show, lighting software, and video/photo editing programs, providing for advanced control of connected modules and protocols. 
 
Users often require an advanced setup in order to fulfill complex tasks. Many controllers on the market are hard to personalize because they are pre-programmed to work in only one way, but often users need different workflow features compared to the one installed by the manufacturer.
 
With Mine S you can quickly and efficiently configure each module and its functions. For example, you can set up the brightness and colors of the LEDs, the speed and incremental value of the encoders, and the curve of action of the slider and pots.

 
Mine S can communicate via different protocols: MIDI, HID, OSC, DMX, and the Art-net protocol. You can even control more than one software and/or protocol at a time for maximum flexibility and fluid transition from one task to the next.

</div></div>","The Timekettle Team announced that it has been named a CES® 2021 Innovation Awards Honoree for its Timekettle M2 Translator Earbuds in the Wearable Technologies category.
Back in 2017, our WT2 campaign launched with tremendous success - the world's most intelligent live translator that enthralled nearly 300K users across the globe. It's currently one of the best-selling translators on Amazon to date.
We listened to our user's experiences to see if we could up our game. After some fine-tuning, we are back with a fully immersive and highly sophisticated pair of earbuds capable of pumping out Hi-Fi music and interpreting many different languages offline. It is a complete answer to your translation needs - the Timekettle M2.


Using WiFi or a cellular network, M2 can translate up to 40 languages, including 93 unique accents. Why 93 accents, you may ask? We understand that not one country has one generalized accent (you'll already know this if you've met a Newyorker in Cali!). To bridge the gap between dialects, Timekettle M2 ensures recognition accuracy is high, allowing you to converse effortlessly wherever you are.
 
Another exciting feature is our Offline Speech Translation technology, which allows you to translate between English and Spanish, French, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and Russian:

No longer will you be traveling abroad, scrambling for WiFi to ask a simple question in the train station to the airport. With Offline Speech Translation, you’ll be fully prepared to get the answers you need to make your journey hassle-free!
 

Scroll to ""HOW TO ENABLE OFFLINE TRANSLATION"" at the bottom of the page.
 
Advanced Engineering
The Timekettle M2 embraces the most advanced technology, and did we mention its highly fashionable style designed for extended wear and comfort?

40 Supported Languages and 93 Accents with WiFi/Data Access

Find out the entire language list in alphabetical order at the bottom of the page.
 
Multifunctional
Our versatile translator is also a fully immersive lifestyle product that can be used to take phone calls and listen to music too!

User Friendly
Turn on the M2 to instantly reconnect to your smartphone in the blink of an eye with Bluetooth 5.0. Play your favorite style of music, or conveniently switch to our app whenever you need to translate with ease.

Touch Mode
For two-way conversations, simply tap the force sensor to activate voice pick-up to simultaneously translate all your spoken sentences. At the tap of a button, feel the freedom to have a natural conversation with friends or business partners from different nationalities.

Lesson Mode
Can you imagine being able to understand instantly what is being said during a lecture or presentation in another language? The M2 captures speech from your surroundings with astonishing clarity so you can quietly listen to translations without disturbing other attendees.

In another country and want to understand the local news? Use the M2 to understand what is being said instantly. It can also be used for movies and general TV!

 
Speaker Mode
A perfect addition as a travel essential - M2 makes you feel safe and confident when communicating in a foreign language. Need to ask for directions, the M2 has you covered. Want to order food or purchase a product, the M2 can translate your questions directly through your phone speaker!

<p>A rhythmic LED beam corresponds with your playing and lights up each time your PocketDrum hits a drum. Like the vibrations, the lights will dynamically reflect the intensity of your drumming, glowing brighter when hit harder and less bright when played softly.</p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1566603344/hacqamahng8npwwl0ihl.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>The PocketDrum vibrates differently for each drum and varies its intensity based on how hard you are playing. The harder or softer you play, the PocketDrum responds with a corresponding vibration, which allows you to better focus on the dynamics of your drumming.</p>

<p>Each drum is set to a different sound, CRASH CYMBAL, CLOSED HI-HAT, BASS DRUM, SNARE, and HIGH TOM, (Cowbell and more Cymbal to come!), so you know which drum you’re hitting and when. Each drum will also respond to the intensity at which you hit the drum.<br/> </p>

<p>PocketDrum only has a 6ms latency from when you hit the drum to when the sound is triggered. This is 76.6% lower than all other competitors. What this means is that PocketDrum feels like the real thing!</p>

</div></div>","==============================================================Thank you all for your overwhelming support in the past 2 months!! We could never be this far without all your support! Even though our campaign has ended, you can still get your PocketDrum set at InDemand and we are working with many other channels to make sure you can always get your most portable drum set in the future. We are working on fulfillment right now, and we will ship your PocketDrum in November!Again, great thanks for all your support！Don't forget to follow us on Facebook and get the newest update for your PocketRing!!!!==============================================================
The PocketDrum is your personal, portable drumkit! Bluetooth-enabled drumsticks connect to our AeroBand App and allow you to add rhythm to your life, anywhere you go. Learn the basics of rhythm, jam freely, or play along with the app, all without the burden of a full drumkit.
 

 
The PocketDrum is the perfect solution of professionals and amateurs alike. A Portable, Noiseless, practical pair of drumsticks that allow you to play and practice the drums anywhere you go. The Bluetooth enabled sticks to connect wirelessly to your AeroBand App, which gives you access to a CRASH CYMBAL, CLOSED HI-HAT, BASS DRUM, SNARE, and HIGH TOM, ( Cowbell and more Cymbals to come!).
 

PocketDrum is extremely easy to set up, with no camera or surface setup needed.

The highly reactive PocketDrum (latency of only 6ms) vibrates with each hit, with different vibrations based on the bounce of drum and force of the hit. The drums also deliver different sounds based on the force of the hit, allowing you to better control your dynamics.
 

 
Enjoy 10 hours of continuous play, with one battery charge, using three modes on your PocketDrum app including Tutorial, Free Mode, and Game Mode. Increase your skill anywhere, anytime with PocketDrum!
 

When PocketDrum meets the professional!
 



By learning and working with the musical and technological professionals, we want to provide you the most realistic sound & drumming experience when you use PocketDrum
 

 



A rhythmic LED beam corresponds with your playing and lights up each time your PocketDrum hits a drum. Like the vibrations, the lights will dynamically reflect the intensity of your drumming, glowing brighter when hit harder and less bright when played softly.
 


The PocketDrum vibrates differently for each drum and varies its intensity based on how hard you are playing. The harder or softer you play, the PocketDrum responds with a corresponding vibration, which allows you to better focus on the dynamics of your drumming.
 


Each drum is set to a different sound, CRASH CYMBAL, CLOSED HI-HAT, BASS DRUM, SNARE, and HIGH TOM, (Cowbell and more Cymbal to come!), so you know which drum you’re hitting and when. Each drum will also respond to the intensity at which you hit the drum. 


PocketDrum only has a 6ms latency from when you hit the drum to when the sound is triggered. This is 76.6% lower than all other competitors. What this means is that PocketDrum feels like the real thing!
 

 

Check out the professional drumming starting at TIME[4:03]!
 
 


 

 
We achieve our technology though our specific Inertial AI chip and our unique space calculating algorithm. These core technologies make PocketDrum be able to capture your movement in 3-dimensional space with accuracy and know exactly which drum you are drumming at and how hard you drum so that PocketDrum could bring you the real and instant vibration feedback that boosts your virtual drumming experience to the next level!
 

 

 

Follow the rhythms provided to get comfortable with drumming. The perfect start point for non-drummers, find the rhythm that's in us all!

 

Create your own rhythms and play to the beat of your own drum!

 

Game time! Test your ability to follow the beat, challenge your friends in a vs. mode, and share your score online.

Game time, beat your friends on speed and accuracy!

<p>Audio input can come from any source, making Timetosser integrate well in any situation. Use it in a DJ-setup, in the studio or on stage in a live set.</p>

<p>The novelty of Timetosser lies in the way it is used: the user is not simply enabling an effect, but has to actively and skillfully play the instrument. Although it takes some practice to master, the live-performance aspect of Timetosser ultimately gives artists greater expression in their performances. </p>

<h3>Tempo sync</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>In order to let Timetosser be aware of the tempo of the incoming music, you have different options. The first option is to use the tap-tempo key to <strong>tap along with the beat</strong>. Timetosser will actively listen to the music and track the tempo, making sure that it stays in sync with the beat.</p>
<p>Another option is to <strong>sync to MIDI-clock</strong>. By connecting the supplied mini-jack to DIN-5 adapter cable to the <strong>MIDI/Sync IN</strong> input, Timetosser is able to synchronise to an incoming MIDI-clock signal.</p>
<p>The sync input also supports <strong>analog gate voltages</strong>. Just connect your gate signal to the sync input directly.</p>
<p>Having <strong>both a MIDI-input <i>and</i> output</strong> means these will be usable from within your DAW software when Timetosser is connected to your computer. But the true advantage comes when Timetosser is used in standalone-mode. Since Timetosser detects the tempo of the incoming audio, the <strong>MIDI-output</strong> can be used to send out that tempo. This means you can synchronise your MIDI-gear and have them play in time with anything you feed into Timetosser. We’re very excited about the possibilities this brings: <strong>blur the lines between DJing and live performing</strong> by having synths and drum machines play alongside your tracks!</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Timetosser audio plugin / USB connectivity</h3>

After developing a VST-plugin incorporating this concept, he decided to build a standalone hardware prototype for his graduation project at the HKU in 2007. His (Dutch) thesis about the underlying principle can be found <a href=""http://www.prototim.nl/het_timetossing_principe.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. </p><p>Although it more or less worked, it was a very basic and crude device. Oscar, being an industrial designer and a flatmate of Tim at the time, was playing a lot with it and became enthusiastic about developing it further.  Years later, the idea was still very much alive between the two of us and with the advent of things like crowdfunding and 3D-printing, we decided that building an improved, more sleeker prototype was something we should definitely do. After spending many evenings after work, we managed to produce two prototypes that were more up to date. Because we were still experimenting, one had RCA-connectors, while the other had jack-plugs.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/029/211/367/d5256222a37cf1c13b2cf21bc870d09a_original.gif?ixlib=rb-2.1.0&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1590403588&amp;auto=format&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=bfb7b6b790b7ea8a400080e7d4bc35e1"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3>Why crowdfunding?</h3><p>In October 2017 we went on our first public show at Amsterdam Dance Event. This festival turned out to be a turning point for us, as it was our true introduction to a growing worldwide music scene. Because we received so much positive response, we grew a lot more confident in Timetosser's potential. It's features were still open for discussion, so meeting people involved in the music industry proved to be very useful as a resource for new ideas and further improvements. </p><p>After ADE, things really picked up and alter.audio was getting official. Timetosser traveled the world to get reviewed by several renowned DJ's and musicians, from who we received terrific feedback. Multiple parties took an interest in Timetosser, but after our experiences at the Sonar 2018 Startup Garden we became certain that launching a crowdfunding campaign was the way to go. We have collected all feedback,  implemented many ideas for improvement and created a production-ready prototype. Now we are ready. It is time to get Timetosser made! </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1594129249/dvbdwoxfqaztoveyjj0b.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1594129265/u1r9vbh7mytkgpoe7ofa.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/X21NiiEjUZE?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><div style=""text-align: center;""> </div><div> </div><h2>We Would Love Your Support</h2><p>The alter.audio Timetosser is almost a reality!

Audio input can come from any source, making Timetosser integrate well in any situation. Use it in a DJ-setup, in the studio or on stage in a live set.
 



 
The novelty of Timetosser lies in the way it is used: the user is not simply enabling an effect, but has to actively and skillfully play the instrument. Although it takes some practice to master, the live-performance aspect of Timetosser ultimately gives artists greater expression in their performances.

Tempo sync
 
In order to let Timetosser be aware of the tempo of the incoming music, you have different options. The first option is to use the tap-tempo key to tap along with the beat. Timetosser will actively listen to the music and track the tempo, making sure that it stays in sync with the beat.
Another option is to sync to MIDI-clock. By connecting the supplied mini-jack to DIN-5 adapter cable to the MIDI/Sync IN input, Timetosser is able to synchronise to an incoming MIDI-clock signal.
The sync input also supports analog gate voltages. Just connect your gate signal to the sync input directly.
Having both a MIDI-input and output means these will be usable from within your DAW software when Timetosser is connected to your computer. But the true advantage comes when Timetosser is used in standalone-mode. Since Timetosser detects the tempo of the incoming audio, the MIDI-output can be used to send out that tempo. This means you can synchronise your MIDI-gear and have them play in time with anything you feed into Timetosser. We’re very excited about the possibilities this brings: blur the lines between DJing and live performing by having synths and drum machines play alongside your tracks!
 

 
Timetosser audio plugin / USB connectivity
 
Besides being a standalone device, Timetosser can also be connected to your computer. This way, it becomes a USB audio interface and controller for the Timetosser audio plugin (VST & AU). 
The audio plugin is a virtual Timetosser that can be dropped as an effect on an audio track in your DAW. One of up to eight plugin instances can be selected and controlled from the hardware unit. 
 

 
Timetosser's firmware can be upgraded through USB with the application that will be downloadable from the alter.audio website.

 About alter.audioThe idea came to Tim back in his student days when he was fiddling around with the music software package “Reason”. After developing a VST-plugin incorporating this concept, he decided to build a standalone hardware prototype for his graduation project at the HKU in 2007. His (Dutch) thesis about the underlying principle can be found here. Although it more or less worked, it was a very basic and crude device. Oscar, being an industrial designer and a flatmate of Tim at the time, was playing a lot with it and became enthusiastic about developing it further.  Years later, the idea was still very much alive between the two of us and with the advent of things like crowdfunding and 3D-printing, we decided that building an improved, more sleeker prototype was something we should definitely do. After spending many evenings after work, we managed to produce two prototypes that were more up to date. Because we were still experimenting, one had RCA-connectors, while the other had jack-plugs.  Why crowdfunding?In October 2017 we went on our first public show at Amsterdam Dance Event. This festival turned out to be a turning point for us, as it was our true introduction to a growing worldwide music scene. Because we received so much positive response, we grew a lot more confident in Timetosser's potential. It's features were still open for discussion, so meeting people involved in the music industry proved to be very useful as a resource for new ideas and further improvements. After ADE, things really picked up and alter.audio was getting official. Timetosser traveled the world to get reviewed by several renowned DJ's and musicians, from who we received terrific feedback. Multiple parties took an interest in Timetosser, but after our experiences at the Sonar 2018 Startup Garden we became certain that launching a crowdfunding campaign was the way to go. We have collected all feedback,  implemented many ideas for improvement and created a production-ready prototype. Now we are ready. It is time to get Timetosser made!      We Would Love Your SupportThe alter.audio Timetosser is almost a reality! Please support alter.audio and join us in the most exciting project of our lives :) Follow us on InstagramFollow us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterJoin our mailing list  PartnersMade in Belgium, designed and engineered in the Netherlands. Timetosser is being made with European quality by working with JTC Micro Electronics as our production partner. JTC has over 20 years of experience in PCB assembly for heavy duty appliances, including military guidance systems and public traffic control. As such, JTC is able to deliver top-notch reliable systems with excellent durability.  Risks and challengesWhile we have years of professional experience designing and creating products, setting up our own company is a new endeavour for us. We are well-informed and have great people helping us, including people who have successfully delivered a crowdfunding project before. The delivery date mentioned with each of the rewards is an indication, not a promise. Every Timetosser consists of many components. If any of these components becomes unavailable or has stocking issues, we might have to push back the delivery date. We have a list of alternative distributors for most of the components to avoid this issue, but there are still parts for which we rely on one source. We endeavour to make Timetosser a high-quality product that meets (and hopefully exceeds) your expectations and we will do our best to get it to you on time.  Environmental commitments Long-lasting designTimetosser is built to last.

<p><strong>PortCaster</strong>™<strong> </strong>is the World's Smallest, Mobile Mixer and USB-C Audio Interface. It's designed for content creators, who record or live-stream to Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitch, and other platforms. It makes it easy to add music, sound effects and guests to your podcast or stream.</p>
<p>About the size of a passport, this product is very portable, so it's great for any type of recording, especially when traveling. It's Made in USA and for a limited time it's very affordable!</p>

<p> </p>
<p>PortCaster offers four channels of audio mixing and easy connections to professional XLR microphones, smartphones and other sources; it uses advanced technology that allows the user to control the podcast, add live vocal sources and sound effects through a comprehensive set of production controls. PortCaster easily connects to most cameras for video work.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Focus on Sound Quality</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1600243870/n1fifuzynymswtqz919k.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>There are over a million podcasts today and that number is constantly growing. With this much competition, how are you supposed to stand out from the crowd? The answer is simple — improve what really matters — the sound quality.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Most podcasters use their phone to record and stream, but you know better. Let's face it, your phone has a great camera, but its built-in microphone leaves much to be desired. That's because the mic in the smartphone is designed primarily for phone calls and not for pristine quality recordings. The resulting audio can have drop-outs,  sound muddy and lack clarity.  None of this helps when you are trying to get your point across!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Same with USB Mics. They try to be the jack of all trades. They pack features and gimmicks for at a low price. Designers have to use cost reduction and that results in extra noise in the recordings. The best way to achive great sound quality is to use a professional mic and a great preamp with A/D converter. That's where PortCaster comes in.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Managing a live show is stressful enough. PortCaster is designed to improve sound quality and bring that stress way down. It is loaded with features to make your job easier. And that lets you <strong>focus on what matters -- your content, your guests and your audience.</strong></p>

<p>PortCaster includes a special feature call-in radio hosts use when taking phone calls. It's called Mix-Minus and it works to prevent annoying audio feedback from traveling back to the caller through the phone line. Mix-Minus is available in big radio station equipment, but until now, was unheard of in this price range.</p>

<p>Let's face it, Instagram™ is a great streaming platform, but there is one drawback — the sound is mono. Until now this has been very frustrating, because most people are accustomed to creating programs in stereo. When you stream a stereo program to Instagram, it only takes the left channel, so anything on the right channel is lost forever. If you had your guest on the right channel, they will not make it to your Instagram stream. </p>

<p>All PortCaster models make it easy to record a high-quality remote interview using any cell phone or tablet. Just connect the USB-C audio jack and use the phone to record or stream!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the R4D model, the interview can also be recorded onto the SD-card. The built-in 24-bit/48kHz stereo recorder in the R4D model offers “One-Touch Record”.  Capture the program locally, while simultaneously streaming online, for an unmatched level of flexibility.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>All this functionality is available in a portable unit, no larger than a passport. PortCaster measures  only 121 mm (4.76″) (L), 70 mm (2.76″) (W), 36 mm (1.42″) (H).</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1600744513/ydc995jn4ti5tneijapa.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>An internal, rechargeable battery (R4M, R4D models) charges from any USB jack and this sets <strong>PortCaster </strong>apart from other portable audio interfaces. Two built-in boutique mic preamps allow connecting up to two microphones or one mic plus a remote guest over the phone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The updated Jasmine™ mic preamps feature 48V Phantom and 65dB of clean gain, making it easy to connect any microphone, including the acclaimed Shure SM7B. To help better control recording levels, PortCaster offers soft-knee, analog, optical limiters for both Host and the Guest, for a truly professional sound. Analog limiters right at the inputs are superior to their digital counterparts, because they can catch the audio peaks before they get to the A/D converter. If distortion comes through all the way to the A/D converter, it will be recorded this way and no digital processor can fix that.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1600045987/cefrvqytxybu9y5in2cf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>PortCaster is designed for live broadcasting and features easy and intuitive operation. It uses tactile analog controls, which are laid out logically and can be accessed without looking, which is important for a busy host, who is running the show and managing the guest at the same time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1600243846/srftik0zzlm2gozhjunx.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>To help survive the stress of a live show, PortCaster is made of aircraft aluminum and purposely avoids any distracting screens or complicated menus. You can run over it with a car (we did) and your PortCaster will continue to work! You cannot do this with cheap plastic imitations! Professional-grade reliability means your product will deliver many years of quality service. </p>

<p>As far as specs are concerned, PortCaster is superior in pretty much every dimension. It can work with any microphone and has less noise than devices costing twice as much. It's smaller than a typical field recorder and features a rechargeable battery, so you can stop spending on AA's. It features easy tactile controls, so you can keep your eyes on the action, not hunting through the menus. Finally, it fits in your pocket, so you can take it anywhere you go. Try doing that with a large mixer!</p>

About the size of a passport, this product is very portable, so it's great for any type of recording, especially when traveling. It's Made in USA and for a limited time it's very affordable!
 

 
PortCaster offers four channels of audio mixing and easy connections to professional XLR microphones, smartphones and other sources; it uses advanced technology that allows the user to control the podcast, add live vocal sources and sound effects through a comprehensive set of production controls. PortCaster easily connects to most cameras for video work.
 

Focus on Sound Quality

There are over a million podcasts today and that number is constantly growing. With this much competition, how are you supposed to stand out from the crowd? The answer is simple — improve what really matters — the sound quality.
 
Most podcasters use their phone to record and stream, but you know better. Let's face it, your phone has a great camera, but its built-in microphone leaves much to be desired. That's because the mic in the smartphone is designed primarily for phone calls and not for pristine quality recordings. The resulting audio can have drop-outs,  sound muddy and lack clarity.  None of this helps when you are trying to get your point across!
 
Same with USB Mics. They try to be the jack of all trades. They pack features and gimmicks for at a low price. Designers have to use cost reduction and that results in extra noise in the recordings. The best way to achive great sound quality is to use a professional mic and a great preamp with A/D converter. That's where PortCaster comes in.
 
Managing a live show is stressful enough. PortCaster is designed to improve sound quality and bring that stress way down. It is loaded with features to make your job easier. And that lets you focus on what matters -- your content, your guests and your audience.
 

Connect Like Never Before

PortCaster helps you connect online with higher audio quality. Core applications of the product are Livestreaming, Storytelling, Web meetings and Worship. We already have customers in all of these areas and they are very happy with the existing product called MixerFace. PortCaster takes that a step forward.
 

 

 

 

 

Core Features

PortCaster is loaded with professional features that make your job easier as a podcaster, VO or a live streamer. From our amazingly quiet Jasmine mic preamps, to Mix-minus for remote calls, to the long lasting, rechargeable battery, to the built-in SD card recorder, you simply won't find this much value anywhere else! Here is quick glance at the core features. 


 

Mix-Minus Feature

PortCaster includes a special feature call-in radio hosts use when taking phone calls. It's called Mix-Minus and it works to prevent annoying audio feedback from traveling back to the caller through the phone line. Mix-Minus is available in big radio station equipment, but until now, was unheard of in this price range.

 
The best part of PortCaster is that you don't need to be a recording engineer to use this feature. Just connect your phone to via a 3.5mm TRRS cable, and you're all set!
 

Remote Guests

Now you can have a remote guest join you over the phone! You can use iPhone, iPad or Android devices to connect remote guests. They can also join you over Facetime, Zoom, Webex, etc.
 

 
PortCaster employs sophisticated electronics to handle the mixing for a phone call, letting you relax and focus on delivering your best performance as a podcast host!
 

Local Guests

Of course, if your guest is local, you can have them join you in person. Stream live together, and take advantage of both XLR inputs and 48V phantom, to power your favorite mics.
 

 
PortCaster features the improved version of our acclaimed Jasmine Mic Preamp, which now delivers 65 dB of clean, low-noise gain and handles the most demanding microphones with ease!
 

Instagram Knob

Let's face it, Instagram™ is a great streaming platform, but there is one drawback — the sound is mono. Until now this has been very frustrating, because most people are accustomed to creating programs in stereo. When you stream a stereo program to Instagram, it only takes the left channel, so anything on the right channel is lost forever. If you had your guest on the right channel, they will not make it to your Instagram stream. 
 

 
PortCaster fixes all that! It has a special MONO knob that takes your Left and Right outputs and sums them to perfect MONO, so that nothing is lost and all of your audio makes it to its final destination. What a relief!
 

Music Knob

PortCaster makes it easy to add music of sound effects to any podcast. We've built-in a line-level input jack and a conveniently located MUSIC knob. This lets you mix in background music or effects from another device.
 

 
Let's say you have an MP3 player laying around. Use it to play your jingle as you introduce the podcast or to play the background music for the entire duration! Use it to play applause, or any other sound effects — the possibilities are endless!
 

Follow the Pros

From Broadway to Hollywood, entertainment professionals rely on CEntrance for sound quality and innovation. What makes a radio station sound good? Consistently clear audio. After years of making recording and broadcast equipment for the pros, we know what it takes to give you that special edge. We know what it means to cut through the noise and make your podcast stand out. These are the few of the radio stations, which use CEntrance equipment:
 

 
CEntrance is well-known in the Voiceover world. Who-is-who of the VO narration community uses our products. Here are some of the top VO artists, who endorse CEntrance:

 
Sound like a professional with PortCaster. Its high-quality circuitry and uncompromising design  will elevate your sound to broadcast studio-level, dramatically improving your production values! Caution: Not a plastic toy! PortCaster delivers solid results!
 

Built on the Acclaimed MixerFace

Our own MixerFace™ took the audio recording world by storm when it  launched in 2017.  It sold thousands of units and was reviewed in the best music publications. It's used at CNN, ESPN an other stations around the world. We received dozens of unsolicited endorsements from the biggest musicians and broadcasters. Just look at the happy faces below!
 

 
MixerFace™ features a rechargeable battery. It turns any smartphone into a portable live-streaming device, with 24-bit/192 kHz audio quality.  It is popular for on-the-go content creation and is often called ""The Swiss Army Knife of Audio"". As more customers began using MixerFace to create talk shows, they requested an easy way to add a live caller to the podcast. With PortCaster, CEntrance made it easy for a caller to join you on the phone.
 

Special Unveiling!

The first-ever live stream using PortCaster was a very special event. Legendary Musician and Artist, George Clinton of Parliament-Funkadelic, premiered his new art collection in a conversation with Perez Art Museum Miami! The show was streamed live on Youtube and we are very proud to say that George Clinton, who likes our products, chose the PortCaster to handle the sound for the event! A prominent Video producer, DJ and Tech Wizard, DJ Ace was working this live stream. Kudos to him for making it sound so great with PortCaster.
 
George Clinton is regarded as one of the foremost innovators of funk music. In 1997, he and Parliament-Funkadelic were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and then, in 2019, were honored with the pinnacle Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.
 

 
Here is the link if you want to watch the livestream:  George Clinton Livestream.
 

But Wait, There is More!

Here is a truly special opportunity that comes around once in a lifetime. George Clinton has graciously agreed to paint a pair of CEntrance headphones (which he likes), for a special giveaway! We've seen the end result, it's a work of art! Here is George, actually painting the headphones:

 
So here is the connection to our campaign. We will be giving away these one-of-a-kind, museum piece headphones to one lucky winner among the first 200 people who back the campaign, so hurry to get your name in the hat*! You have to act fast in order to be among the first 200 people to sign up. We will announce the winner once we have 200 backers.
 
We are so jealous! Some R&B and Hip-hop music fan out there is about to get very lucky!
 

Amazing Perks

We have prepared amazing perks for you! Enjoy great savings on PortCaster, but act quick, because the best deals won't last. Each price tier has only 50 pcs available and the price will go up as soon as 50 pcs are depleted. We are offering two models in this campaign:
 

 
- PortCaster R4M (Mobile Broadcasting Interface) model offers great analog and digital technology and also, a rechargeable battery, so you can record anywhere. Retail price of this model is set at $299.99
 

 
- PortCaster R4D (Digital Broadcasting Interface) model  offers all that, plus a built-in micro SD Card recorder, so you don't even need a phone to record. Retail price of this model is set at $399.99
 

 
But wait, there is more! We have also prepared matching headphones and microphones! Our acclaimed Cerene dB headphones are in demand by audiophiles and musicians alike. They are very comfortable to wear and feature transparent, natural sound — great for working on audio or just kicking back and enjoying the tunes.
 

 
Our custom PivotMic XY stereo microphones come in a precision-matched pair. They feature low-noise, cardioid, directional capsules with Japanese technology, and 20Hz...30kHz frequency response. Both are available for immediate shipment.
 
We designed our headphones and microphones to be compatible with both MixerFace and PortCaster. If you decide to choose PortCaster with headphones,  you can start enjoying the headphones right away, while you wait for the fulfillment of the main perk.
 

Full Feature List

All PortCaster models make it easy to record a high-quality remote interview using any cell phone or tablet. Just connect the USB-C audio jack and use the phone to record or stream!
 
In the R4D model, the interview can also be recorded onto the SD-card. The built-in 24-bit/48kHz stereo recorder in the R4D model offers “One-Touch Record”.  Capture the program locally, while simultaneously streaming online, for an unmatched level of flexibility.
 

 
All this functionality is available in a portable unit, no larger than a passport. PortCaster measures  only 121 mm (4.76″) (L), 70 mm (2.76″) (W), 36 mm (1.42″) (H).

 
An internal, rechargeable battery (R4M, R4D models) charges from any USB jack and this sets PortCaster apart from other portable audio interfaces. Two built-in boutique mic preamps allow connecting up to two microphones or one mic plus a remote guest over the phone.
 
The updated Jasmine™ mic preamps feature 48V Phantom and 65dB of clean gain, making it easy to connect any microphone, including the acclaimed Shure SM7B. To help better control recording levels, PortCaster offers soft-knee, analog, optical limiters for both Host and the Guest, for a truly professional sound. Analog limiters right at the inputs are superior to their digital counterparts, because they can catch the audio peaks before they get to the A/D converter. If distortion comes through all the way to the A/D converter, it will be recorded this way and no digital processor can fix that.

PortCaster is designed for live broadcasting and features easy and intuitive operation. It uses tactile analog controls, which are laid out logically and can be accessed without looking, which is important for a busy host, who is running the show and managing the guest at the same time.
 

Built Tough

To help survive the stress of a live show, PortCaster is made of aircraft aluminum and purposely avoids any distracting screens or complicated menus. You can run over it with a car (we did) and your PortCaster will continue to work! You cannot do this with cheap plastic imitations! Professional-grade reliability means your product will deliver many years of quality service. 
 

 

Goes Anywhere You Go

PortCaster fits in the pocket, allowing you to travel light and have the piece of mind that you can create content anywhere inspiration strikes you.
 

 

PortCaster vs. Alternatives

As far as specs are concerned, PortCaster is superior in pretty much every dimension. It can work with any microphone and has less noise than devices costing twice as much. It's smaller than a typical field recorder and features a rechargeable battery, so you can stop spending on AA's. It features easy tactile controls, so you can keep your eyes on the action, not hunting through the menus. Finally, it fits in your pocket, so you can take it anywhere you go. Try doing that with a large mixer!

In the Press

CEntrance makes products for  recording professionals and audiophile customers. This dual focus allows us to keep our eye on sound quality, while ensuring professional-grade reliability.  Here are some publications, which profiled us over the years:

 

About the Brand

CEntrance develops portable audio devices with exceptional performance and sound quality. The name is pronounced “sentrance” and means “at the core”. Our product line is focused on personal audio, inspiring the tagline: “Making Audio Personal™” and reflecting our dedication to serving customers, quality and perfection. Stereophile Magazine suitably dubbed CEntrance products “Affordable Digital Excellence,” a sign of approval from the renowned ""golden ears.""

With our passion for sound rooted in pro audio, we continue doing what we do best – delivering innovative recording and playback products that delight customers with their sound quality and ease-of-use.
 

Development and Delivery


We anticipate the following delivery schedule. PortCaster is based on an existing MixerFace product. All the tooling is already done. Main technology, such as audio and battery charging circuitry, two optical limiters, USB-C interfacing, etc., has already been proven in other products and therefore we don't expect any issues, since there is a lot of reuse.
 

 
R&D is complete and we have prototypes. Campaign funds will go towards purchasing components and mass production.
 

Risks and Challenges

This is our 8th crowdfunding project, so we've been through this process before and have thousands of satisfied customers. We have sufficient staff to see things through and ensure customer satisfaction.
We build our product in the USA, but like many companies, we source some parts from Asia. This year is special because of travel restrictions, so we have worked extra hard to secure the most reliable suppliers for this project. We have known these partners for over 10 years, so our relationships are strong — this helps to overcome adversity.
We are always transparent in our communication with our customers. Expect regular status updates, in which we will share project progress, all the way to shipping date. We like crowdfunding because of the special connection we develop with our customers and this project is not an exception. It will be fun!

PaMu Scroll's big upgrade from Bluetooth 4.2, Bluetooth 5.0 offers Higher Speed, Longer Range, and Powerful Sound.


The PaMu Scroll sounds similar to Apple's Airpods, but with deeper bass and crisper highs, which sounds richer and clearer.


Connect to any of your devices that use Bluetooth technology:
·       Android phones, tablets, and other mobile devices
·       Apple iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Macbook
·       Any other devices with Bluetooth technology

Its mini ergonomic design comes with different sized ear tips (S/M/L) to best fit your ears.  Simply place the PaMu Scroll and twist into your ears.   They will never fall out, even when running, working, exercising , or engaging in any other activities.




Don't worry about hiding the PaMu Scroll when running on a rainy day because the PaMu Scroll has been given an IPX6 rating.  This means that the PaMu Scroll can get wet, whether it’s a light spray or exposure to heavy rain. They are also dust resistant, which makes them perfect for when riding bikes, ATV’s, motorcycles and other powersports vehicles.



Activate Siri through the PaMu Scroll. Two taps lets you talk to Siri without taking your phone out from your pocket.
 
 



Never worry about losing power when you go out! Enjoy the PaMu Scroll with non-stop music for up to 3.5 hours on every charge.

<p>Thinking of cutting the cord for your next earbuds purchase?Cancelling significant  noise across almost all frequencies but also use less power?DSI Supersonic earbud is the solution.</p>
<p>There are quite a few factors to consider when buying wireless earbuds, things like sound quality, battery life, and fit. Well, we’ve thought of all those factors and then some. This is why we at DSI are proud to bring our newest product, the Supersonic Noise Cancelling earbuds to Indiegogo.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1578332421/fkpm07hqvrubfsx2v89k.jpg"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1578332442/xu5o8fcezdfc5hgpryhy.jpg"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1578332484/wjz7a8e9uozlje5l4nuy.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We use Hybrid Active Noise Cancellation to significantly reduce low-frequency sound by up to 95%. We’ve achieved this by integrating dual microphones—one feed-forward and one feed-back—into the body of our design to catch more of the ambient sounds around you. Once those ambient sounds are detected, the noise cancelling feature goes into effect. On its own, the result of this feature is impressive. The quality of whatever you’re listening to will be virtually untarnished by the sounds of the outside world. The sound is isolated up to 35dB which makes these one of the top wireless earbuds portable design you can easily use on loud public transport when you want to have some “yourself time”.And just as impressive is the energy saving design inherent to our noise cancelling technology. You’ll get a superior noise cancelling effect at a fraction of the energy expenditure of many similar products. </p>

<p>Our earbuds are packed with advanced audio technology. The 6mm driver inside each earbud is incredibly small, yet unbelievably powerful. Our  Noise Cancelling Processor  combines Digital Noise Cancelling, 24-bit Audio Signal Processing, and a Digital-to-Analogue Converter with a headphone amplifier. For those who might not know what to make of these specs, just be prepared to expect stunning sound with minimal distortion.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1579586149/gjxy7reoejnmxiznrvgp.png"" src=""""/>DSI achieves high resolution sound by employing aptX technology.We used Qualcomm aptX HD  to answer the growing demand for high resolution audio.

Thinking of cutting the cord for your next earbuds purchase?Cancelling significant  noise across almost all frequencies but also use less power?DSI Supersonic earbud is the solution.
There are quite a few factors to consider when buying wireless earbuds, things like sound quality, battery life, and fit. Well, we’ve thought of all those factors and then some. This is why we at DSI are proud to bring our newest product, the Supersonic Noise Cancelling earbuds to Indiegogo.

We use Hybrid Active Noise Cancellation to significantly reduce low-frequency sound by up to 95%. We’ve achieved this by integrating dual microphones—one feed-forward and one feed-back—into the body of our design to catch more of the ambient sounds around you. Once those ambient sounds are detected, the noise cancelling feature goes into effect. On its own, the result of this feature is impressive. The quality of whatever you’re listening to will be virtually untarnished by the sounds of the outside world. The sound is isolated up to 35dB which makes these one of the top wireless earbuds portable design you can easily use on loud public transport when you want to have some “yourself time”.And just as impressive is the energy saving design inherent to our noise cancelling technology. You’ll get a superior noise cancelling effect at a fraction of the energy expenditure of many similar products. 

Our earbuds are packed with advanced audio technology. The 6mm driver inside each earbud is incredibly small, yet unbelievably powerful. Our  Noise Cancelling Processor  combines Digital Noise Cancelling, 24-bit Audio Signal Processing, and a Digital-to-Analogue Converter with a headphone amplifier. For those who might not know what to make of these specs, just be prepared to expect stunning sound with minimal distortion.DSI achieves high resolution sound by employing aptX technology.We used Qualcomm aptX HD  to answer the growing demand for high resolution audio. This enhanced codec supports 24-bit music quality over Bluetooth. This means listeners can hear even the smallest details in their music.
With our powerful noise cancelling technology, you may find yourself getting lost in the richness and depth of a song, or in the engrossing voice of a podcaster, or in the high-end sound design of an action-packed Hollywood production. That’s great! But sometimes it’s helpful or even important to hear what’s going on in the outside world.And we’ve got you covered with Ambient Sound Mode (ASM), a feature that channels the sounds of the outside world back into your ears. With our simple and intuitive touch controls, activating or deactivating ASM is a cinch.To activate Ambient sound mode,Touch and hold the touchpad until you hear ""Turn on ambient sound."" Next, you will hear ""Ambient sound turned on"" that means the feature is activated.To disable Ambient sound mode, touch and hold the touchpad until you hear ""Turn off ambient sound."" When you hear ""Ambient sound turned off,"" that means the feature is deactivated.Ambient Sound Mode turns off automatically during a call . The mode comes back to its previous state after the call.DSI Supersonic noise cancelling wireless earbuds offer true wireless freedom thanks to our bluetooth 5.0 Q chipset wireless technology.It’s especially unbearable when you are watching a movie or playing games. DSI features Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity to transmit sound faster in a stable and secured way.  DSI Supersonic noise cancellation earbuds  can reach a maximum of 100ft without any interruptions.Ready to charge your earbuds? Simply snap them into place inside of the included charging case and the charging process will begin immediately. On a full charge, the earbuds offer 12 hours of power, plus the case itself carries an additional 360 hours of charge time. For 3 to 4 hours of daily use, a fully charged case will let you enjoy wireless music for up to a month between charges. When it’s time to finally charge the case, you can use a USB-C cable or wireless charger.DSI Supersonic also supports wireless charging.You can power up your charging case case without worrying about usb cables.Our ultra thin wireless charger is designed to perfectly match DSI, but it can charge all of your devices.

<p>Each earbud comes with the <strong><span style=""color: #990000;"">Ambrose Diaphonic Ear Lens</span></strong> (ADEL™), one for each ear.  The lens is a thin, patented membrane that absorbs the harmful pneumatic pressures that cause hearing loss and prevent the speaker and eardrum from working optimally.  <br/><br/>The benefits of this include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will also find you have <strong><span style=""color: #990000;"">reduced audio fatigue</span></strong>, which comes from discomfort when the tiny muscles in your ear ache from protecting the eardrum and resisting pneumatic pressure for too long.  </li>
<li>You will have <strong><span style=""color: #990000;"">less occlusion effect</span></strong> - the distorted booming or echo-like sound of your own voice when speaking.  </li>
<li>Finally, you will be able to ""<font color=""#990000""><b>score your life to music</b></font>"" - go about your day with sealed ears yet be able to carry on a conversation while enjoying your music or maintaining awareness in an office or other busy environment with external sounds as far in the background or foreground as you desire.</li>

<i>Q. </i><i>Everyone seems to have earbuds for listening to music nowadays. What makes the  ADEL™ Drum Earbud different from the hundreds of brands out there?​</i><i> </i>
</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">A.  Our patented ADEL™ technology does something no other earbud on the market does - it protects your ear from the effects of pneumatic pressure.  The problem with conventional earbuds is that when they plug up the ear canal, there is no where else for the pneumatic pressure to go except right up against your drum, and eventually you experience hearing loss.  We have tested our products at the world's top-ranked audiology research center - Vanderbilt University Medical Center, which determined that our earbuds do indeed allow people to listen to music at dramatically lower volumes that preserve hearing.  We have shared the results within this Indiegogo page and on our website.</li>

<i>Q. </i><i>What exactly does a ""second eardrum"" do?​</i><i> </i>
</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">A.  Our patented ADEL™ technology is effectively an artificial eardrum.  But instead of taking sound energy and transferring it to the ossicles, it acts as a protector, ""taking the bullet"" for the real ear drum when dangerous levels of pressure are exerted into the ear canal.  You could also think of it as a safety valve that takes the pressure off the ear drum.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<i>Q. How can </i>ADEL™<i> be both safe and have a better sound.  Isn't it one or the other?​</i><i> </i>
</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">A.  Life is full of trade-offs but not in this case. We protect your ear by removing the stiff air that results from sealing the ear canal.  No more eardrum battering ram.  Now the speaker and the eardrum and move freely just like they would if you were in the free space of a concert hall.</li>

<i>Q. </i><i>Are you coming out with a wireless earbud?​</i><i> </i>
</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">A.  We have been approached by wireless earbud makers but at this time their devices all lack audio quality.  We chose to first establish a reputation for audiophile quality sound.  That is why top performing artists choose ADEL™ products.  We can, however, improve the audio quality of a wireless earbud.</li>

<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<i>Q. So is this hearing aid?</i><i>​</i><i> </i>
</li>

</ul><ul>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<i>Q. What is the benefit of a hybrid earbud?​</i><i> </i>
</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">A.  A hybrid earbud uses dynamic speakers and balanced armatures. Dynamic drivers generally have larger diaphragms with much lower mass and therefore have a tendency to be faster and smoother with lower distortion and much better bass, midrange and transient response than balanced armatures.  Balanced armature drivers have the problematic property of producing nonlinear distortion at much lower driven levels than dynamic drivers.  However balanced armature speakers are very efficient producers of specific frequencies and therefore are useful for creating very loud higher frequency sounds.  While marrying dynamic drivers with balanced armatures commonly results in a wider audio spectrum, the high frequencies produced by balanced armatures have commonly been known to sound harsh or ""brittle"" - like breaking glass instead of brilliant silk.  That's where our elegant ADEL™ technology comes to the rescue: the normally harsher high frequencies produced by the more efficient balanced armature high frequency designs are beautifully smoothed and opened up by proper focusing of the ADEL™ Drum membrane (our second ear drum), resulting in an incomparable listening experience which is able to be heard distinctly at low volumes without needless environmental isolation.   Our Hybrid ADEL™ Drum is a breakthrough in in-ear audio fidelity featuring incomparable bass and midrange acoustics beautifully married with extremely open, smooth and silky balanced armature high frequencies, which are typically much harsher using other approaches.</li>

Earbud Features/Choices
Each earbud comes with the Ambrose Diaphonic Ear Lens (ADEL™), one for each ear.  The lens is a thin, patented membrane that absorbs the harmful pneumatic pressures that cause hearing loss and prevent the speaker and eardrum from working optimally.  The benefits of this include the following:

You will also find you have reduced audio fatigue, which comes from discomfort when the tiny muscles in your ear ache from protecting the eardrum and resisting pneumatic pressure for too long.  
You will have less occlusion effect - the distorted booming or echo-like sound of your own voice when speaking.  
Finally, you will be able to ""score your life to music"" - go about your day with sealed ears yet be able to carry on a conversation while enjoying your music or maintaining awareness in an office or other busy environment with external sounds as far in the background or foreground as you desire.

 

Speaker

10mm Drum - Single 10mm moving coil speaker. Delivers bass that exceeds top-of-the-line over ear headphones. Still capable of clear mids and highs, with adjustable bass that is focused with the tensioner.
11mm Drum - Features a Cardas Audio moving coil speaker. This allows for very crisp and cohesive sound.  The Cardas speaker incorporates a powerful Neodymium magnet, a patented technique that prevents performance degrading eddy-currents.
11mm Drum Hybrid - Features the Cardas speaker, paired with a balanced armature speaker.  The result:  great bottom end, smooth mids,  forward treble and very good top end extension.

 

Tensioner

Hex Set - Tighten or loosen tensioner with a small Allen key that comes with this option, giving you the ability to match the match the impedance of each ear drum to maximize sound energy transfer, as well as achieving a desired sound signature.
Thumbscrew - allows user to adjust tensioner while earbuds are in your ears, giving you  the ability to match the impedance of each ear drum easier than with an external tool  to maximize sound energy transfer, as well as achieving a desired sound signature.

 

Connector & Cord

Hardwired - 3' cord permanently attached to each earbud.
2 Pin - Allows you to conveniently remove and customize the cord.

 

Eartips
Comply™ Foam Tip provides a more secure grip than silicone tips so the earbuds stay in your ear during workouts or other activity; Softer than silicone and more comfortable, eliminating canal fatigue, adding to the safety of your hearing.
 

On-Cord Microphone
Allows users to use ADEL™ Drum Earbuds in conjunction with a cell phone to make & receive calls.
 

Grille & Casing

High Impact Plastic - The grille is constructed of the same color high impact plastic as the horn (the part that the ear tip is attached to, and speaker casing). 
Aerospace Grade Aluminum - An option with higher perks, a machined aluminum grille adds a touch of aesthetics   Once you experience it you won’t want to listen any other way.  Once you experience it you won’t want to listen any other way.

PaMu Quiet offers all the best.PaMu Quiet applies Qualcomm's flagship chip, QCC5124, supporing the best sound quality in the market. Qualcomm aptX Classic, SBC, AAC decoding, 48kHz/16-bit LPCM audio.Ready For Multi-Frequency Brilliance?PaMu Quiet Lets You Listen Loud to;BONE-RATTLING BEATS from the super-deep sub woofer;DEEP RICH BASSLINES thanks to outstanding elasticity;FULL & BRIGHT MIDS for a textured sound;CRYSTAL-CLEAR TREBLE so you hear every nuanceEXCLUSIVE CUSTOMISED SPEAKERThe combination of the following delivers an unprecedented sound experience and performance with beautiful balance across the full frequency range:10mm LARGE DRIVER enhances the depth of the bassAGILE PEN TITANIUM COMPOSITE DIAPHRAGM delivers good ductilityPRECIOUS TITANIUM METAL produces awesome sound quality at high frequenciesPRECISION-DESIGNED SOUND CAVITYWe designed over 10 iterations of PaMu Quiet’s sound cavity before hitting the sweet spot.Our brilliant sound cavity delivers              • AMAZING NOISE CANCELLATION              • PERFECT SOUND QUALITY              • A BIG REDUCTION IN EAR PRESSURE for more comfortYou never have to sacrifice comfort for sound quality with PaMu Quiet. Your ears get the best of both worlds.              BEAUTIFUL SOUND              INCREDIBLE COMFORTHow do we do it? We’ve conducted careful research into 2 key areas that cause discomfort to wearers of earbuds:THE STETHOSCOPE EFFECTThis is a popping sound that can be heard in some earphones when walking or talking. It’s caused by completely sealing the in-ear silicon earplugs. We’ve eliminated the stethoscope effect by designing our earphones with precision vents to open the silicon and equalize the pressure. So you get the same brilliant bass, with better comfort.EAR PRESSURE REDUCTIONOur precision designed sound cavity results in a big reduction in pressure for your enhanced listening comfort.

Fitness Technology and Music, designed with the technology of Personalized A.I. Voice Coaching, Smart Heart Rate Sensor and SOUL FIT App. Real-time Personalized Voice Coaching, powered by BiomechEngine™, differentiates BLADE from other sports earphones. Unlike other products which only track and report the basic data, such as running time, cadence, speed, etc, BLADE offers more by capturing and analyzing your motion data to deliver real-time personalized coaching advice.  With the BiomechEngine™ collecting all your training data and evaluating them in real-time, SOUL’s Personalized A.I. Voice Coaching is able to monitor your running form and provide instant feedback to correct your posture seamlessly. With a proper running posture, risk of different kinds of running injuries, such as Runner's knee, Hamstring issues and etc, would be greatly minimized.A good running form minimizes the energy wasted from unnecessary motions and thereby maintains the running efficiency. With A.I. Voice Coaching, a better running form could be maintained to help you run faster and longer distance. For example, BLADE is able to monitor your step width to see if it is correct, as a narrower step width reduces unnecessary side movements, saving your energy.In the past, to extract such a large amount of running form data, a high level of scientific equipment was a must; however, thanks to BiomechEngine™, the world’s first biomechanics solution developed by Beflex Inc., founded by a group of professional researchers from KAIST in Korea, we are now able to track and monitor our running form anytime and anywhere with just a pair of tiny earbuds.    Unlike other tracking devices, BLADE's built-in Smart Heart Rate Sensor does not only monitor your body condition during workout, but also provides you with instant coaching advice by alerting you once the target heart rate zone has been reached. When beginning a workout session, you may need to gradually build up to a level that is within your target heart rate zone. Such function enhances your training efficiency and avoids over-training.  

We understand that the accuracy of heart rate sensor is essential to your training, so we have teamed up with Valencell, the leading innovator in high-performance biometric sensor technology for wearables and hearables, to incorporate their HRM solutions into BLADE and bring the most reliable monitoring function to you.

 
Your effort is a waste if you do not have a set of right information to review and analyze. Running distance and pace are essential but these data do not tell you about the full picture of your training performance. With BLADE, data of your running form and heart rate condition will be collected in real-time and automatically synchronized into SOUL FIT app.Other than that, all these data will be visualized into meaningful number and charts which enable you to monitor your training progress anytime. Not only basic tracking data is provided, but also information of running form and evaluation of injury risk, which both are not available from other sport earphones, or even other tracking wearable. BLADE is designed with Bluetooth 5.0 technology to enable 2X faster data transfer speed and 4X range of data transmission. Simply speaking, BLADE provides not only a stronger connection, but also ultimate sound quality as a result of the minimum audio data loss in transmission.Comes along with an USB Type-C Charging Case with fast charging function, BLADE delivers the best sound quality for up to 96 hours on-the-go, almost 24 times of full marathon races.With the IPX7 waterproof design, BLADE can be fully submerged up to 1 meter in water for 30 minutes. BLADE is designed for every condition: From excess perspiration as a result of arduous training, to extreme climate during any outdoor activities. Developed with a pair of 5.8mm powerful dynamic drivers, BLADE delivers superior sound quality with rich bass and balanced mids and highs seamlessly by the Advanced Audio Coding (AAC), which achieves better sound quality than MP3 format at the same bit rate.We would like you to get indulged in the immersive sound quality from BLADE, but we do also concern about your safety when walking across busy junctions or during night run. So we design BLADE with Transparent Audio Mode which allows you to hear the surrounding whenever you need to.

 

BLADE is attached with Freebit™ C-shape Ear Hooks to guarantee a secure fit. The perfectly designed contours keep both earbuds securely in place at all times. In addition to the comforty factor, the build of BLADE produces a passive noise isolation effect, which is able to keep all extraneous audio interference to a minimum. Stop pressing your old true wireless earphones inside your ears, just for changing a song. BLADE is designed with a Smart Touch Interface for you to control playlist, answer calls and activate your Siri or Google Assistant, simply with just a tap and most importantly, you don’t need to hurt your ears anymore.No longer suffering from Mono Call (Output sound from only one side of earphones) with your existing true wireless earphones, BLADE is engineered for Stereo Call which means that both sides of earphones will output the voice from another side of your call.What is more, thanks to the MEMS Mic, which featured with matched sensitivity, flat frequency response and a high signal to noise ratio, your friends can now hear you clearly wherever you are at home or crowded area.No more hassle to connect your BLADE with smartphones. Simply take out the earbuds from charging case and they will be automatically paired up right away.We do not only provide you with two color options for BLADE, but also the options of which leather cover to go along with the charging case. With magnetic design, you could easily change the leather cover with just a flip.If you are an online influencer/ brand owner/ athlete/ etc., let us know as we would like to design the customized leather cover for you!BLADE allows you to connect with the world anytime during your training, just a touch away to activate your Siri or Google Assistant. We design BLADE as the Ultimate Solution to cater to the need of fitness enthusiasts and music lovers, but we won’t just stop from here.

We want artists around the world to be able to pick up the instrument, turn it on and play - no need to connect to any other equipment. Being an electronic instrument, you can of course output the audio signal or MIDI messages straight from the Lumen.












Why Make an Electronic Handpan?
Acoustic handpans, from their origins in Switzerland to the many varieties available today, all have a number of things in common:

A beautiful, vibrant sound
Distinctive playing style
Rare
Expensive
The last two are the key: artists around the world struggle to get hold of them. We want to change that.
A second hand Hang, the instrument which originally inspired the Lumen, has been seen on eBay for over $9000. Even modern acoustic alternatives sell for upward of $2000.








So, where to from here?

 The prototype you see in our launch video is what we've managed to achieve on our own. In order to take it to the next level, we need to hand it over to an industrial design team - and we already have an award winning team standing by.
Once the project is funded, we'll work closely with them to work out all of the details, hopefully adding some extra features as we go.
Paul Boyter, a renowned percussionist (and star of our launch video), will be providing assistance from the performance side, while Soniccouture will be doing the instrument sampling and sound design.

 Measured from the light source at a brightness of 6000 optical lumens (2000 ANSI lumens), the optical engine offers high dynamic contrast ratio.

<br/><strong>SpeakEasy Stereo System | Sets Itself Apart</strong>
</h3>
<p>Designed for those who want to enjoy the highest quality sound of music, the ability to control compatible devices throughout the home, and manage every day tasks – all with the power of your voice.</p>
<p>You can listen to the SpeakEasy Stereo System on it's own, or connect it wirelessly to The Como Audio Bluetooth Turntable and enjoy your record collection.</p>
<p>Founding CEO Tom DeVesto started Como Audio with the single goal of creating beautiful music systems that allow simple and easy access to the myriad of music content available to today’s music enthusiast. SpeakEasy Stereo System takes this simplicity to the next level with the Google Assistant built-in.<i> </i></p>

<h3>
<strong>True High-Fideli</strong><strong>ty Stereo System</strong>
</h3>
<p>Unlike one-piece ""stereo"" smart speakers which offer little to no channel separation, or manipulate the sound in an attempt to simulate stereo sound, SpeakEasy Stereo System is a true two channel, Hi-Fi system. Once the wire from the SpeakEasy Speaker is connected, the two units provide an authentic stereo image and generous sound stage, just like music was meant to be heard.</p>
<p>Should your Wi-Fi network become unavailable, you'll continue to experience stereo sound from both units when streaming via Bluetooth from the Como Audio Turntable or your smart phone. Since the SpeakEasy Speaker takes its power from SpeakEasy's stereo amplifier, an external power supply is not needed. And since the SpeakEasy Speaker is wired, it won't take additional bandwidth from your network.</p>
<h3><strong>Sound Quality | Designed to Play Music </strong></h3>
<p>Each unit features  a ¾” soft dome tweeter and 3” custom, dual voice coil woofer. Along with the custom DSP equalization, the result is great high-fidelity sound, reproducing your favorite music as it was recorded.</p>
<p>The rear port further enhances low bass frequencies while conveniently doubling as a carry handle.  A 25 watt per channel Class D digital amplifier supplies plenty of volume, while a nearly ½” thick MDF cabinet holds everything together with a distinguished look. Supported audio codecs include HE-AAC, LC-AAC, CELT/Opus, MP3, Vorbis, Wav, and FLAC.</p>

<h1>""Good morning, good afternoon or good evening, wherever you maybe, welcome to the PureSounds Headset Project!"" </h1>
<p>(Inspired by the C2C host George Noory)</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h1>Background (Typical Scenario)</h1>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I am sure I am not the only one who came up with a burning desire to perfect the sound quality of both earphones and microphone of most headsets. Usually, it is so frustrating to find out that it just does not work, especially the microphone part. Sometimes, it barely works and is definitely not up to your satisfaction. It can be laden with all kinds of noises, hums, pops, clicks, statics and contact losses. After paying decently or sometimes dearly, you find that it offers very little value for your money.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><br/></span></p>
<h1><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Early Prototypes Success</span></h1>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">So, I went a step further and created a prototype.</span><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/134506/files/20131015104600-early_prototype.png?1381859160"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em;""/><br/></p>
<p><i>My early crude PureSounds prototype</i><br/></p>As you rightly guess, yes, it failed fantastically! I believed in ""first things must fail"" motto, so it did not set me back at all. I kept on modifying and learning from mistakes until one day when I perfected it. So perfect that I was asked by a factory representative how I achieved it.<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/134512/files/20131015104956-16.jpg?1381859396"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<i>PureSounds' real performance on a PC with -47dBFS noise floor</i><br/><p></p>
<p>Later, I sold a bunch of those early crude prototypes that I called SECM to people all over the world! I had to stop making them, as I went to study at the university. (SECM means Super Excellent Computer Microphone!)<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h1>Back on Track</h1>
<p>(...... some miseries here ......) Then I got a few jobs, saved up a bit of money to continue what I enjoy doing; innovating. First thing that came to my mind was my PureSounds headset project.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h1>What is a PureSounds Headset</h1>
<p>If you are curious about what a PureSounds headset is or wonder if it is yet another mega sound headset project, please let me tell you that it has more to offer! In fact, it is a funky multipurpose headset. <br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/134518/files/20131015105156-1.jpg?1381859516"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em;""/><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>With a PureSounds headset, not only that you could enjoy great music whenever and wherever you want, you no longer need to scream into your microphone when you speak or bare the noise, clipping, cracking and statics. All these plus the best build quality materials and last, but not least, at a very reasonable price.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/134530/files/20131015105356-2.jpg?1381859636"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><i>PureSounds headset, a true value for money!</i><br/></p>
<p>It’s a truly plug and play device that works on any computer or audio system. No software is needed. The electronic circuit board inside the headset processes the voice data in real-time with no alteration.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/134541/files/20131015105629-4.jpg?1381859789"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>You can use the PureSounds headset to listen to music. It will be built with a pair of highest quality double rare earth magnet speakers for you to enjoy your great music in its purest and richest sounds; from the faintest tumbling bass to the loudest bursts.</p>
<p>You can use the PureSounds headset to talk to your loved ones via your computer. Thank to the noise cancelling ability of the embedded circuit, your voice will sound in the most natural way. Your love ones on the other side will not be able to differentiate whether you are talking via your computer or next to them!</p>
<p>You can use the PureSounds headsets to run a call centre or telesales business. Because of its superb microphone sound quality, no doubt you will save a lot of time and money looking for another one. In fact, you will never need to.</p>
<p>If you are a voice over artist or record an audio diary every now and then, you will find the PureSounds headset extremely useful. Moreover, it is also suitable for gaming, voice recognition, pod cast, audio/video conferencing, streaming, etc. The sky is the limit to your imagination.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h1>dB or dBFS (Sorry, if it spins your head, it spins mine already!)</h1>
<p>Manufacturers like to quote according to their best interests. Sometimes this translates to misleading, confusion or misunderstanding, especially when it comes to the use of dB which is a logarithmic unit to express performance of microphones and speakers.</p>
<p>On the dB scale, the electret condenser microphone used in my PureSounds headset would typically have the manufacturer's quote of S/N of 69dB and the sensitivity of -87dB. The formula to measure S/N is 20log(VS/VN), and the formula for sensitivity is V/Pa @ 1kHz.</p>
<p>While these values give you some technical details, you are left with no practical clue to how well your microphone or speaker will perform when you plug them into your computer or sound system that works on a different rules and principles.</p>
<p>On your computer, signals are represented by bit rate and depth. This makes sense because your computer works with bits of 0s and 1s, not dB! Computer programs such as Audacity or any sound recording program somehow has to translate this logarithmic ratio dB to something that your computer can cope with, i.e., dBFS which means decibel full scale. </p>
<p>On a typical computer, it usually ranges from -60dBFS to 0dBFS. Your room noise such as your typing, breathing, clock ticking (if you have a rather loud one), people walking on the pavement outside of your house can range from -55dBFS to -47dBFS. When a human starts speaking, it can range from -43dBFS all the way to 0dBFS and beyond, but your computer can only cope to 0dBFS max, thus making your recorded voice clipped when you speak loudly into your microphone!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h1>Microphone Performance and Specifications</h1>
<p>I have carefully designed the circuit used in the PureSounds headset to faithfully capture and reproduce the whole audible spectrum from 20 to 20kHz. Its measured sensitivity ranges from faintest to bustling city traffic sounds (0 to 90dB or -60dBFS to 0dBFS). <br/></p>

<p>I do not particularly have a big risk or challenge in successfully completing my PureSounds headset project.

<p>The only real risk I can think of is either I get into a freak accident and could not use my hands to build the headsets or some of the semi-finished headsets from the good old factory in China arrive damaged or wrong, despite the DHL's top notch service, thus delaying the production to a few more weeks or a month at worst I guess!</p>
<p>To overcome myself from getting into a freak accident, I will well look after my health and safety in and around the house and my garage.</p>
<p>To overcome any potential shipping problem of the bulk shipment of my custom-made headsets from the good old factory in China, I will make sure, double check, if necessary, triple check everything is right. Despite these precautions from my side, should any unforeseeable mishap arrive, I will try my best to resolve it and I ask for your understanding to lend me some more time.

(Inspired by the C2C host George Noory)

Background (Typical Scenario)
I am sure I am not the only one who came up with a burning desire to perfect the sound quality of both earphones and microphone of most headsets. Usually, it is so frustrating to find out that it just does not work, especially the microphone part. Sometimes, it barely works and is definitely not up to your satisfaction. It can be laden with all kinds of noises, hums, pops, clicks, statics and contact losses. After paying decently or sometimes dearly, you find that it offers very little value for your money.

Early Prototypes Success
So, I went a step further and created a prototype.

My early crude PureSounds prototypeAs you rightly guess, yes, it failed fantastically! I believed in ""first things must fail"" motto, so it did not set me back at all. I kept on modifying and learning from mistakes until one day when I perfected it. So perfect that I was asked by a factory representative how I achieved it.



PureSounds' real performance on a PC with -47dBFS noise floor
Later, I sold a bunch of those early crude prototypes that I called SECM to people all over the world! I had to stop making them, as I went to study at the university. (SECM means Super Excellent Computer Microphone!)


Back on Track
(...... some miseries here ......) Then I got a few jobs, saved up a bit of money to continue what I enjoy doing; innovating. First thing that came to my mind was my PureSounds headset project.

What is a PureSounds Headset
If you are curious about what a PureSounds headset is or wonder if it is yet another mega sound headset project, please let me tell you that it has more to offer! In fact, it is a funky multipurpose headset. 



With a PureSounds headset, not only that you could enjoy great music whenever and wherever you want, you no longer need to scream into your microphone when you speak or bare the noise, clipping, cracking and statics. All these plus the best build quality materials and last, but not least, at a very reasonable price.

PureSounds headset description


PureSounds headset, a true value for money!
It’s a truly plug and play device that works on any computer or audio system. No software is needed. The electronic circuit board inside the headset processes the voice data in real-time with no alteration.





You can use the PureSounds headset to listen to music. It will be built with a pair of highest quality double rare earth magnet speakers for you to enjoy your great music in its purest and richest sounds; from the faintest tumbling bass to the loudest bursts.
You can use the PureSounds headset to talk to your loved ones via your computer. Thank to the noise cancelling ability of the embedded circuit, your voice will sound in the most natural way. Your love ones on the other side will not be able to differentiate whether you are talking via your computer or next to them!
You can use the PureSounds headsets to run a call centre or telesales business. Because of its superb microphone sound quality, no doubt you will save a lot of time and money looking for another one. In fact, you will never need to.
If you are a voice over artist or record an audio diary every now and then, you will find the PureSounds headset extremely useful. Moreover, it is also suitable for gaming, voice recognition, pod cast, audio/video conferencing, streaming, etc. The sky is the limit to your imagination.

dB or dBFS (Sorry, if it spins your head, it spins mine already!)
Manufacturers like to quote according to their best interests. Sometimes this translates to misleading, confusion or misunderstanding, especially when it comes to the use of dB which is a logarithmic unit to express performance of microphones and speakers.
On the dB scale, the electret condenser microphone used in my PureSounds headset would typically have the manufacturer's quote of S/N of 69dB and the sensitivity of -87dB. The formula to measure S/N is 20log(VS/VN), and the formula for sensitivity is V/Pa @ 1kHz.
While these values give you some technical details, you are left with no practical clue to how well your microphone or speaker will perform when you plug them into your computer or sound system that works on a different rules and principles.
On your computer, signals are represented by bit rate and depth. This makes sense because your computer works with bits of 0s and 1s, not dB! Computer programs such as Audacity or any sound recording program somehow has to translate this logarithmic ratio dB to something that your computer can cope with, i.e., dBFS which means decibel full scale. 
On a typical computer, it usually ranges from -60dBFS to 0dBFS. Your room noise such as your typing, breathing, clock ticking (if you have a rather loud one), people walking on the pavement outside of your house can range from -55dBFS to -47dBFS. When a human starts speaking, it can range from -43dBFS all the way to 0dBFS and beyond, but your computer can only cope to 0dBFS max, thus making your recorded voice clipped when you speak loudly into your microphone!

Microphone Performance and Specifications
I have carefully designed the circuit used in the PureSounds headset to faithfully capture and reproduce the whole audible spectrum from 20 to 20kHz. Its measured sensitivity ranges from faintest to bustling city traffic sounds (0 to 90dB or -60dBFS to 0dBFS). 

45dBFS (normal human voice to room noise)

-43dBFS (Faintest voice a human can make)
Having said that, electrical noise such as high frequency switching noise, statics, pops, clipping or cracking has no place in my PureSounds headset. This has been one of the most stringent design requirements from the start.
Frequency response : 20 - 20kHz
S/N : 69dB
Sensitivity : -87±3dB SPL @ 1kHz

After setting up the languages for both meeting participants, the built-in microphones will be automatically grouped into two clusters and each assigned to a specific participant to pick up his voices for translation. Within seconds, the translated audio will be broadcasted almost immediately for the audience to hear, and meanwhile, be transcribed and displayed on the screen to see Were the two participants to share a pair of True Wireless Stereo earbuds connected to Langogo Summit Pro via Bluetooth, they could hear the audio in their intended target language from their corresponding earbud for seamless and effective communication.

Understanding while hearing a foreign speech or lecture is as easy as pressing a button. Not only does Langogo Summit Pro faithfully record it, but also transcribes it in both native and translated languages to show on the screen for the listener to view in real-time. 


 

  Getting a quality one-on-one interview or trying to communicate with a foreigner has never been easier.

Simply press the talk button and talk into the microphone what you want translated. Releasing the button broadcasts the translated voice to your audience immediately who can then speak into the microphone, and Langogo Summit Pro will work vice versa. It’s so foolproof that anyone can use it straight out of the box.

Langogo Summit Pro is great for your on-the-go translation needs. Whether you are trying to read the menu at a restaurant, or the exhibit label in a museum when traveling overseas, you could snap a photo of it using Langogo Summit Pro, and promptly, the translated image will be visible on the screen and audible through the loudspeakers.
The 8MP rear camera with fast autofocus and OCR technology recognizes 46 different languages.

Our pursuit of excellence has finally led to the development of a TWS earbud that is unparalleled in sound quality - even against that of audiophile-grade wired in-ear monitors - and has the latest technological advancements that make it perfect for the active lifestyle. On top of this, the T2000 is the first of few TWS earbuds which implement ultraviolet lights within the charging case to ensure every listening session is clean and healthy. The TINHIFI T2000 utilizes dual dynamic driver and crossover technology to combine the power and detail of a 9mm and 8mmm Nitinol Dynamic Diaphragm. The Nitinol diaphragm is a custom innovation that combines nickel and titanium to create the ultra-fast membrane response necessary for a clear and translucent sound. This technology provides an acoustic performance that normal dynamic drivers are simply incapable of, and even faster transient responses than that of special beryllium coated drivers. These drivers are implemented with our in-house passive crossover network that separates the sound frequencies to perfectly match the performance of each driver. The latest DAC and Bluetooth chipsets further ensure a seamless and coherent listen like never before. Add an ergonomic design and you’ve got an unparalleled sound quality in a perfect fit. Now, whether you’re a Hi-Fi audiophile enthusiast or an on-the-go daily runner, you can enjoy the immersive world of high-fidelity audio anywhere, anytime!  

 
 
Our goal in creating the T2000 was not to make another average TWS earbud. It was to take high-fidelity musical listening to a whole new level, while also adding the comfort and freedom of a TWS system. The T2000 has the option to switch between wireless and wired modes to best fit the needs of the listeners. While the sonic performance of the T2000 is unparalleled in both modes, we understand that many audiophile enthusiasts enjoy a wired performance using their favorite music device. Hence, in the wired-mode with the included MMCX 4-core OCC copper cable, the T2000 performs passively, allowing the music device’s sound characteristic to power the earphone. This is also perfect for lower-battery situations. But don’t worry, the 650mAh battery of the T2000 with Quick Charge provides up to 3-4 hours of playback, ensuring it’s always ready for wireless listening. Enjoy your music anytime, anywhere, and anyhow you desire! The choice is yours.  We at TINHIFI have always been first and foremost focused on excellent sound quality. The history of our T-series lineup, with the T1,  T2, T2 Pro, T3, T4, and P1 audiophile-grade in-ear monitors, has always been praised worldwide, and we see the T2000 as a continuation of this legacy.  The T2000 features dual dynamic drivers composed of an industry breakthrough material - the Nitinol diaphragm. The nickel and titanium driver balances out the smooth and harsh sonic properties of these metals to deliver a sound unlike that of any other driver. While expensive to manufacturer, we decided to use two of these revolutionary drivers, one for the lows and mids, and the other for the highs, to maintain coherency and smooth transition in the tonal balance.While expensive to manufacturer, we decided to use two of these revolutionary drivers, one for the lows and mids, and the other for the highs, to maintain coherency and smooth transition in the tonal balance. The 9mm driver imparts a deep and powerful bass and smooth mids to highlight the vocal textures, while the 8mm driver resonates transparent and crystal clear highs that shines every detail within the music. Unlike other TWS earbuds, we specially engineered the acoustic cavity of the T2000 to create life-like imaging of the sound that will perfectly unify the sounds from the two drivers. Every thought and effort was poured into the acoustic design of the T2000 to ensure an uncompromising Hi-Fi music experience. We've improved upon our own high standards of manufacturing from the T-series in-ear monitors. Our team has worked tirelessly to guarantee the finest build quality to make sure your T2000 is durable for any terrain and long-lasting.  Beyond the drivers themselves, a great High-Fidelity audio requires a Digital to Analog chip to power the speakers. This is why we have implemented the latest CSR DAC chipset into the T2000, thus delivering an immersive and ultra-clear sound. The latest RTL8763BFP Bluetooth 5.0 chipset further ensures a latency-free seamless listening experience.  The T2000 Charging Case with Fast Charge and built-in UV Light System also serves as a housing for the included MMCX cable. Our team has worked hard to design an all-inclusive case for the T2000 that is still in a practical and convenient size. The T2000 case fits into any pocket and is a perfect fit for any occasion!  We have tested many designs for the T2000. Due to its wireless design, we knew we had to make the fit perfect to prevent any drops, worries, and discomforts. The shape of the T2000 was taken from molds of the human ears to make sure every curve matches perfectly with the contours of the ear. Whether you are walking around, running, or dancing, the T2000 will stay comfortably in your ears - worry-free. Now, you can enjoy your music all-day, without thinking twice about your earbuds.      As sophisticated components are equipped in the earphone set (including both earbuds and ear case), please follow the safety instructions carefully,

Moreover, 2 selectable operating modes support 2x current or 2x voltage, as needed by depending on the type of connected headphones. Then, we took a further step for details by adopting an analog volume control.

</div></div>","Says who? EarStudio is the world’s first and only 24bit Bluetooth receiver designed to deliver studio-quality sound through your ears WIRELESS - using your existing wired headphones, earphones or even speakers. This thumb-sized gadget packed with technologies supports Qualcomm’s aptX HD codec, which allows you to stream 24bit hi-res music wireless. Unluckily for the iPhone users, the aptX HD codec has never been of their interest - but don’t you worry. EarStudio automatically enhances 16bit music into 24bit sound. Meaning, whatever device you are using(iPhone or Android), whatever the source is(from Spotify streaming to hi-res music files), you will be able to enjoy 24bit sound through EarStudio.    EarStudio places the most focus on the sound quality along with convenience and affordability. We use CSR 8675 Qualcomm Chip and 2x DACs of AK4375a. Noise free, jitter free. To brief you through the journey of EarStudio’s operation, EarStudio reproduces the sound over Bluetooth into 88.2KHz/24Bit through Radsone’s patented DCT technology which reduces subtle digital noise and cleans the jitter from Bluetooth streaming.Dual DACs with analog volume controlEarStudio has optimized circuit architecture, proprietary DualDrive technology, using 2 independent Hi-Fi DACs and Amplifiers. Unlike other dual DAC audio systems, the fully differential audio signal path directly goes to the output jack, with NO switch components in the way, delivering pure signal without any loss or distortion, and with enough power. Moreover, 2 selectable operating modes support 2x current or 2x voltage, as needed by depending on the type of connected headphones. Then, we took a further step for details by adopting an analog volume control. Digital volume adjustment has the downside because it scales down PCM audio sample before the D/A conversion, resulting in harsh sound and the loss in sound detail, SNR, as well as THD. EarStudio offers analog volume control to keep the optimal audio performance even at low volume level using Programmable Gain Amplifier (PGA) which is the best way to control the volume.Full Balanced and single ended outputEarStudio offers two outputs: A single-ended/double current 3.5mm jack and full-balanced/double voltage 2.5mm Jack.    The Overview How to use  World's first studio-quality 24bit sound playback through BluetoothEarStudio supports the Qualcomm aptX HD codec, which allows you to receive 48KHz/24bit audio via Bluetooth. What’s even more special about it is that it will reproduce 24bit sound from any music streaming through over 16bit codec such as SBC, aptX or AAC. The magic behind it is Radsone's patented technology called DCT which big names in the industry(LG, Audio Technica, Astell&Kern etc) have adopted in their latest products.As an official member of Qualcomm’s CSR eXtension program, we are one of the few R&D teams in the world with the capability of handling CSR Digital Signal Processor, especially CSR8675. EarStudio is a total assembly of our technologies, algorithms and years of dedication for high-quality Bluetooth audio streaming.DCT(Distinctive Clear Technology)DCT technology solves fundamental digital audio problems by eliminating the subtle digital noise inherent in all digital sound. The longer you listen, DCT, a kind of advanced dithering will be done for a natural pattern, and it improves the masking curve associated with audio signals to virtually eliminate quantization errors. Meaning, DCT makes the sound more precise and natural, and users will be able to listen in detail. This technology is patented including USA and Japan.DCT eliminates quantization errors, thereby generating analog-like natural patternsSpectrogram after DCT demonstrates improved masking curve with noise suppression. Details are emphasized while maintaining the overall shape.Click to experience DCT through the Android Radsone music app now!Click to experience DCT through the iOS Radsone music app now!DCT BlueDCT Blue is a newly developed version of DCT specialized for Bluetooth streaming. Of course, EarStudio is the first product in the world to showcase the technology - its proprietary precise Sample Rate Adjustment scheme enables jitter-free wireless audio streaming as shown below.  EarStudio is the first Bluetooth receiver in the world equipped with 2 external Hi-Fi DACs. Our proprietary DualDrive technology doubles the given HW performance by using 2 external DACs(Asahi Kasei AK4375a), pure-balanced 2.5mm port and a customized 3.5mm port. This improves the dynamic range for headphones, especially in the bass band. EarStudio’s 350mAh battery provides 14 hours of continuous playback. You could literally listen to music all day without charging! Typical Bluetooth receivers usually have much shorter playback time, mostly under 10 hours. Even with its extensive battery life, EarStudio only weighs 20g, lighter than one AA battery (24g)! EarStudio provides a regular single-ended 3.5mm jack and a pure-balanced 2.5mm jack that doubles the output power and cancels out unwanted DC offset and noise from analogue component.Single-ended, 2x current mode fits low impedance headphones and full-differential, 2x voltage mode fits high impedance headphones. Meaning, EarStudio effortlessly drives ANY type of low/high impedance headphones you own. The digital volume control operates on a fixed-bit field; in that case, the DAC cannot make the fractional part of the number and degrades sound quality especially in low level.When adjusting the analog volume down to a certain level with EarStudio, the signal peak is decreased as well as noise floor; resulting in no loss in SNR as shown above. The EarStudio supports analog volume control(when controlling the volume via the app or the buttons on the device) which maintains the sound quality. EarStudio also offers a USB port through which you can play lossless music even while charging.  Unlike most other devices, we will be supporting Device Firmware Updates for your EarStudio. This means that our further updates, optimization and bug fixes will be done at your home in a matter of seconds, not having to send the actual product to us. Keep your EarStudio software fresh for the rest of your life! All EarStudio backers will have free access to the EarStudio iOS/Android mobile application! Through this app, the users will have detailed control over the sound and hardware.          DEMO

The design will look familiar, and that’s because when something fits and feels right, there’s no reason to change it. And the sound? Explorer delivers natural, detailed sound, far better than any smartphone.</p><div>
<p>The reason for this is simple: smartphones have to be thinner, faster, and lighter, and to do all of the things we’ve come to expect from them without a hitch. That takes a lot of creativity and ingenuity on behalf of the engineers that design them, but it also makes a smartphone a “jack of all trades, master of none”. Sound quality is not the first priority — if it’s a priority at all.</p>
<p>The Explorer, on the other hand, is a custom-built portable listening device. It’s got all the good parts needed to make great sound — stuff that just won’t fit into a phone. Explorer’s also got enough power to make any kind of headphone really kick. Or, as George would say:</p>
<blockquote>""Nearly half of the PC board inside the Explorer is stacked with dedicated audio circuitry. The high-quality TI / Burr Brown PCM1792 chip is the same DAC that has been sourced for ultra-high-end audiophile desktop DACs and CD players, some of which cost well over $1,000. It delivers natural, detailed sound that is far more realistic than anything a smartphone is designed to produce. The Explorer’s powerful dedicated amp section gives it the ability to drive not just popular “studio” or “prosumer” headphones, but real, professional music production-grade headphones that normally require a dedicated amplifier - the type that are actually used in studios for mixing and mastering.”</blockquote>
<p>The Explorer has its versatile side, too. By running our player on Android, we’ve given it more than just high-quality sound — we’ve made it a streaming device. We give our users the option of using stock Android or our proprietary, easy-to-use User Interface (UI),  and we’ve included support for TIDAL and other key Android apps in both the UI and stock Android OS.</p>
<p>Have your own HiFi music library that you want to bring with you onto the Explorer? No problem! The Explorer is designed to be fully compatible with most digital file formats, including WAV, AIFF and FLAC. It also comes standard with 64GB of internal memory, and has a MicroSD slot that allows you to upgrade to a total capacity of 192GB.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We’re really proud of the Explorer, and even thought about making this campaign all about it. Between its amazing sound  and unique design, we already know everyone is going to love it.</p>
<p>But we have big ambitions, and a Hi-Fi player needs a listening companion... </p>

HeadFi.org - Finder X1 Review/Impressions/Discussions Thread
 The Explorer The Explorer comes stock with four different color options:  Mahogany - Maple - Zebra Wood and EbonyAlong  with our earphones, we’ve been developing the Explorer, a high-fidelity portable audio player that runs on Android and is designed for all music lovers. The design will look familiar, and that’s because when something fits and feels right, there’s no reason to change it. And the sound? Explorer delivers natural, detailed sound, far better than any smartphone.
The reason for this is simple: smartphones have to be thinner, faster, and lighter, and to do all of the things we’ve come to expect from them without a hitch.

It delivers natural, detailed sound that is far more realistic than anything a smartphone is designed to produce. The Explorer’s powerful dedicated amp section gives it the ability to drive not just popular “studio” or “prosumer” headphones, but real, professional music production-grade headphones that normally require a dedicated amplifier - the type that are actually used in studios for mixing and mastering.”
The Explorer has its versatile side, too. By running our player on Android, we’ve given it more than just high-quality sound — we’ve made it a streaming device. We give our users the option of using stock Android or our proprietary, easy-to-use User Interface (UI),  and we’ve included support for TIDAL and other key Android apps in both the UI and stock Android OS.
Have your own HiFi music library that you want to bring with you onto the Explorer? No problem! The Explorer is designed to be fully compatible with most digital file formats, including WAV, AIFF and FLAC. It also comes standard with 64GB of internal memory, and has a MicroSD slot that allows you to upgrade to a total capacity of 192GB.
 
We’re really proud of the Explorer, and even thought about making this campaign all about it. Between its amazing sound  and unique design, we already know everyone is going to love it.
But we have big ambitions, and a Hi-Fi player needs a listening companion... 
The Finder X1
  The Finder X1 is our titanium-housed earphone, and it is ridiculously durable. The solid titanium housings, thick shielded cable, and unique internal strain relief design all combine to make the most durable earphone in existence. We’re so confident about how tough these mothers are that we’re providing a no-questions-asked 3 year warranty — they’re really that tough. Click here to watch them get run over by dozens of cars during LA rush hour traffic — they survive with barely a scratch, and still sound just like they’d been pulled fresh from the box.Speaking of sound, the Finder uses a unique new driver — that’s the little speaker-thingie — to deliver the most detailed and ALIVE sound of any dynamic-driver earphone on the market. The driver is built from German-made PEEK (Polyether Ether Ketone), a super-strong polymer, so they can be incredibly thin, but still durable.Head audio-geek George says: “This makes them ultra-responsive, enhancing the detail and fidelity of the sound they produce, and allows them to reproduce more impactful deep sub-bass, adding to the realism of the sound, while preserving a clean midrange and detailed treble, and avoiding the muddy, bloated mid-bass of many trendy headphones — the Finder’s bass is powerful and rumbly, but doesn’t cloud the rest of the sound, leaving the mids and treble to shine through.”In other words: they sound like live music, and kick ass. Where You Come In
The Finders are ready to go. We’ve already begun mass production and have a few hundred units ready to ship. We’ve finished our design of the Explorer, and are almost ready to put it in your hands. We need your support to work out the last few details of our user interface, and help move the product into mass production. By launching these two high-quality audio products on Indiegogo and selling them at a reasonable retail price, we hope to help spread the love of music, worldwide.
 

Doing Good Through the 
Power of Music

We founded this company because of our love for music, and that passion has pushed us to have plans beyond just making these products. We are a company with a global vision — a vision of a future where everyone can appreciate music the way it’s meant to be appreciated, both by listening and playing. We want to use our products, and all of our resources, to spread the love of music to as many people as possible.
 

As a first step, we’ve partnered with Seattle Music Partners for our campaign. SMP is a locally-funded, grassroots program serving the city of Seattle by providing free music lessons to underprivileged children. These kids grow up in the heart of Seattle, a budding and prosperous city, and yet they have limited access to instruments and instruction.
We believe in Seattle Music Partners, the power of music, and our products. We want to harness the power of music to unite people and do good for the world. If that sounds naïve and new-agey, we’re sorry. This is very real for us.
If you feel as we feel, please support our campaign — we give you our word that we’re not here just for handouts. We plan on giving you far more than your money’s worth, both in this campaign and in the years to come.

<p>To us, Newmsnr is a work of passion. Although we are engineers and tech pros by vocation, we are dreamers at heart. <strong>Our goal is to make people's lives better</strong> anyway that we can. As we designed our cutting-edge earbuds, we were always thinking of you, our valued customers. We want you to feel like these are the last and only earbuds you will ever need (or want!)</p>
<p>A year ago, we started manufacturing TWS(true wireless) earbuds. We found most of the TWS earbuds designed for sports were not really suited for sports enthusiasts. Thus we started thinking why can't we create one? Therefore, <strong>after a year's worth of research and development,</strong> we finally made our own TWS earbuds which are <strong>affordable</strong>, <strong>easy to use</strong>, <strong>and ideal for everyday use</strong> or <strong>intensive sports activity</strong>. </p>

Most earbuds on the market are struggled with signal interference, exceeding the Bluetooth range, and have the issue with the music will be automatically stopped.Additionally, most market earbuds are highly dependent on the proximity of the device. Ultimately, most current market earbuds cannot be used without a device present. Traditional TWS Earbuds vs.Sportfy Internal Storage EarbudsThat's when we decided to create an earbud that is truly device free and unimpeded by distance. One that works independently but still provides premium sound quality at an affordable price. Sportfy allows you to be free from limitation and listens to music anytime any place.  Leave Your Phone BehindSportfy earbuds double as media players, so you can leave your phone behind! Offering 512MB internal storage, upload your favorite workout playlist and exercise device-free. Helping you to concentrate on what you are doing and keeping you entertained.  While other devices over-complicate the pairing process, thus driving up the prices and lowering the durability of their products, the Bluetooth 5.0 compatibility in Sportfy means that pairing is never difficult.

Sportfy Earbuds In Pool Real Footage 

 

Having sold TWS earbuds on Amazon for nearly two years, we have generated lots of positive feedback. Confidently shop with us, knowing that all our products are well-tested, professionally engineered, and come highly-rated among Amazon users.
 


 

If you love our project, please do share to your friends/families:-D  

 
 You get to choose from three different earbud sleeve sizes, all of which come with your earbuds. We have also packed in a USB cable! Don't worry: everything is snug and secure for shipping. 

 
 

To us, Newmsnr is a work of passion. Although we are engineers and tech pros by vocation, we are dreamers at heart. Our goal is to make people's lives better anyway that we can. As we designed our cutting-edge earbuds, we were always thinking of you, our valued customers. We want you to feel like these are the last and only earbuds you will ever need (or want!)
A year ago, we started manufacturing TWS(true wireless) earbuds. We found most of the TWS earbuds designed for sports were not really suited for sports enthusiasts. Thus we started thinking why can't we create one? Therefore, after a year's worth of research and development, we finally made our own TWS earbuds which are affordable, easy to use, and ideal for everyday use or intensive sports activity.",52.0,4,"1 Campaign

The noise reduction scheme applied here is the result of research executed at the VUmc Medical Center in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.<br/>It is not just based on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), but on the SNR of signal fluctuations, as speech is an ever changing signal and it are those changes that carry much of the information.

The ear buds dampen the surrounding sounds, while the hearable presents an improved version of those sounds through those ear buds. By applying a microphone array and the aforementioned noise-reduction scheme, this results in a lower noise volume and clearer speech.</p><p>To accommodate for mild and moderately impaired listeners, one of eight different hearing profiles can be chosen to optimize their perception. Suggestions for the choice can be based on estimates of pure-tone sensitivity, on the results of selective speech-in-noise tests, or simply on the experiences of the listener. Profiles can be replaced very easily, so also a trial-and-error method can be used. For normally-hearing users, a flat profile will be used.

After it installs the appropriate and latest version of firmware, you can choose settings and update or upgrade your SnowOwl (via over the air firmware upgrade capability), control device functions, and setup audio streaming.We have designed our platform so that it gives consumers all the tools they need to easily create, store, and apply audio. This allows them to optimize their speech reception performance under challenging conditions and more generally to deal with high noise levels, regardless of their hearing ability (limited to mild-moderate hearing losses).Giving consumers tools for self education, tools to assess and manage loudness exposure, and tools to assess audio profile/hearing capability are an important part of what we call our “system-approach”. It allows consumers to make better informed decisions on their hearing care and offers them total freedom of choice. In this vision, we also feel that consumers should have the option to ask assistance/counselling of a caretaker or health care professional. Therefore, the platform also has capability to remotely fine tune devices (only with permission).Our main goal of noise reduction is optimizing the understandability of speech.  When there is more noise in the environment, everybody automatically talks louder. However, normally-hearing people only increase their volume to a level where normally-hearing listeners can just understand them.For hearing-impaired listeners that means that the speech levels are always a handful of dB too soft for them and they miss out in the conversation. Our aim is to give them back those 4 to 6 dB, so they can partake normally in the conversation again. Therefore, we reduce the noise by 5 to 6 dB, instead of reducing it as much as possible.In addition, it is crucial to apply a noise reduction scheme that does not damage the speech. The noise reduction scheme applied here is the result of research executed at the VUmc Medical Center in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.It is not just based on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), but on the SNR of signal fluctuations, as speech is an ever changing signal and it are those changes that carry much of the information. This results in the SNR in the modulation domain. So, we want to boost the fluctuations in the speech-noise mixture as appropriately as possible. The applied LINE-1 noise suppression scheme is covered by multiple US patents. This noise suppression scheme is a single channel noise suppression scheme that we have applied for the left and right audio channels independently. This enable the brain to keep using the spatial information. It was developed at the VUmc Medical Center in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and is based on the comparison of the actual frequency spectrum of an audio frame to the estimated frequency spectrum of the noise. It has proved to enhance speech perception in hearing tests in both normally-hearing and hearing-impaired listeners.SnowOwl is intended for listening to your environment through a combination of ear buds and the wearable. The ear buds dampen the surrounding sounds, while the hearable presents an improved version of those sounds through those ear buds. By applying a microphone array and the aforementioned noise-reduction scheme, this results in a lower noise volume and clearer speech.To accommodate for mild and moderately impaired listeners, one of eight different hearing profiles can be chosen to optimize their perception. Suggestions for the choice can be based on estimates of pure-tone sensitivity, on the results of selective speech-in-noise tests, or simply on the experiences of the listener. Profiles can be replaced very easily, so also a trial-and-error method can be used. For normally-hearing users, a flat profile will be used. It is the combination of noise reduction and hearing profiles that optimizes the listening experience when using our hearable to make conversing under noisy conditions easier.  Right now, we are looking to you for help raising $25,000. This start-up capital will cover the costs of manufacturing, marketing, and distributing SnowOwl on a wide scale. As a thank-you, we plan on sending out SnowOwl at a discounted rate to anyone who contributes at least that dollar value to this campaign.If you are a hearing provider interested in carrying this unique next generation wearable into your practice, you can order one of the provider packages. One of the many things that let the SnowOwl stand out is that you can service those products via in-store or remote services. SnowOwl is not a Hearing Aid. It is intended for everybody that has a need for improved speech in noise capabilities. For people who are struggling with mild or moderate hearing problems, a whole new generation of hearable and wearable are getting on the market that have some speech-in-noise improvement capability. Our Audio platform and the SnowOwl are bringing this to a totally new level.. SnowOwl is a device that assist in many challenging situations, for a wide variety of audio profiles. Everybody can think of situations where they are in need of this handy high quality tool that makes parties, festivals, restaurants and other high-noise environments easier to navigate.The biggest risk with our project is in finding the right manufacturing partners. Our Audio platform 2.0 has not yet been released, however the core audio features are all fully developed and tested. Because of the sensitivity of SnowOwl, we need to work only with people who are reliable and who understand the importance of what we are doing. We intend to choose our partners very carefully.Beyond making a monetary contribution, you can help us by sharing our campaign with all your friends and family. Go ahead and post the campaign URL on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and any other social media platforms you use. The more people are aware of what we are doing beforehand, the smoother the SnowOwl launch will go.We appreciate all contributions, monetary and non-monetary, and we extend to you, our supporters, our deepest gratitude.",26.0,0,"1 Campaign

Production DocumentationOur factory has more than 10 years experience when it comes to production of complicated shapes of electronic products. There are four different factories working together to produce the components necessary for production. Each process and component is taken care of with an experienced technical team. Our main engineer has more than 10 years worth of industrial working experience.Our factory can produce up to 10,000 pieces each month in the main factory.Identification of the electronic devices will be according to the standards set by different countries e.g. ROSE, CE etc. Materials used to make the products are eco-friendly and under the management of quality control. Age testing and function testing is also done by the quality control team to make sure everything is perfect.         AD'OM Prime and AD'OM Premium are nearly complete. We’re currently ramping up at our factory and are ready to meet the estimated delivery times.We’ve done our very best to forecast demand and create a solid production plan.We have eight years experience with manufacturing in China. We’ve learned a lot during this time, but sometimes forecasts don’t always hit the mark. Should we miss projections, we’ll let you know why and make it right as quickly as possible. Supply Chain RiskWe’ve spent the past year building a very capable team who work hard to ensure smooth delivery of all our products. However, component delays and unexpected shortages can occur. If this happens, we’ll be sure to keep you informed and work to quickly solve the problem. Terms and ConditionsBackers that are not satisfied with our product and want to return it, have to pay for the shipping costs.",34.0,6,"1 Campaign

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;""><b></b></span></p>
<p><span>How can I reach you?</span></p>
<p><i>You can send us any questions, concerns, or ideas directly through Indiegogo or email us at contact@optinvent.com</i></p>
<br/><p>Where will you ship to?</p>
<p><i>We ship worldwide!</i></p>
<br/><p>What’s the battery like?</p>
<p><i>A 2000mAh battery powers the ORA-X, and the battery life will vary based on how it’s used--just like any other mobile device. Camera, WiFi, and GPS will consume battery when left on, but we estimate the average battery life to be eight hours. </i></p>
<br/><p>How do I re-charge the ORA-X?</p>
<p><i>The standard ORA-X recharges with a micro USB, and the Luxe edition comes with a docking stand.</i></p>
<br/><p>Will the ORA-X display hurt my eyes? </p>
<p><i>The ORA-X is not different from any other monitor or projection device -- ideal use is not recommended.</i></p>
<p><i><br/></i></p>
<p>What if I have a vision problem?</p>
<p><i>The ORA-X compatible with most eyewear so you can use it while wearing your own glasses.  Contact lenses are of course no problem.</i></p>
<br/><p>How do I type on the ORA-X?</p>
<p><i>We’re developing a program called EyeSpeech with partner called Telepath Eye. The program will type using a corousel input method with the touchpad to allow for more fluid text input. </i></p>
<br/><p>What is “pass through mode”?</p>
<p><i>As a user, you can choose to employ this mode so that you’re not isolated from the environment. The ORA-X uses the microphone to take in ambient, environmental sounds to keep you safe. </i></p>
<br/><p>What version of Android does the device run and how do firmware updates work?</p>
<p><i>Our prototypes are currently running on Android 4.4.2.  This may or may not be upgraded by the time we launch.  If we do upgrade the firmware after launch, we will notify you and send instructions on how to update the firmware easily.  Currently we don't have OTA firmware upgrade capabilities but this may be possible in the future.</i></p>
<br/><p>Can I get a refund?</p>
<p><i>Your contribution and pledge to our campaign is non-refundable and binding. We will abide by Indiegogo’s policies in case of conflict. </i></p>
<div>
<p></p>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
<p>Why
did your funding goal change?</p>
<i>
We had quite a few people ask us if we would still make the ORA-X if we
didn’t reach our funding goal.  In order to dispel those concerns we asked
Indiegogo to change our funding goal and they agreed to do so. The goal does
not in any way affect our ability to manufacture ORA-X or fulfill your perks.
It should just gives more confidence to existing and new backers that we are
dedicated to making the ORA-X a reality. We chose to run a “Flexible
Funding” campaign, meaning everyone will get their perks with or without a
goal.</i><br/>

</div></div>","ORA-X: Headphones ReimaginedORA-X are more than a pair of headphones -- they are a wearable tablet. These smart headphones work on the flexible Android platform, so right out of the box they are ready to use and personalize based on your favorite apps, or ready to load new programs of your own creation! With an average eight hour battery life, ORA-X’s technology can be utilized throughout the entire day in a variety of ways. Whether you’re a certified technophile or a music lover who wants to take their audio experience to the next level, our headphones will revolutionize the way you interact with and create media.
“After all, even the biggest technophobes out there probably feel pretty comfortable throwing on a pair of headphones. ORA-X turns one of the most commonplace gadgets on earth into something futuristic and exciting.”-- Jacob Kleinman, TechnoBuffalo
“...it's not simply an extension of your phone like the Apple Watch but a fully-functional complimentary device.”-- Andrew Tarantola, Engadget

This is the next step in headphones.
The future of augmented reality packaged in a pair of sleek, high end noise isolating headphones with 50 mm drivers for full rich bass. ORA-X headphones enhance and expand the listening experience in order to create an interactive visualization of whatever you’re hearing. You can watch new music videos, see notifications about your favorite artists and much more.  “...the ORA-X is an over-the-ear style headphone that features a flip down display. With this, the display becomes optional, so when you don't want to use it you can move it out of your direct line of view.”-- Jared Dipane, Androidcentral
Proven pioneers in augmented reality.
We’ve been working on augmented reality hardware for over 8 years and have 13 patents on our core technology. With the ORA-1 AR Glasses we proved we were up to the challenge of designing, building and delivering advanced augmented reality hardware. With the ORA-X we’ve taken the ORA-1’s patented technology and created an entirely new device category.
“Optinvent…[has] been working on AR glasses for a long time, and they really know what they are doing when it comes to wearable transparent display.”-- Eliane Fiolet, Ubergizmo



Designing the future. 
For the developer, this isn’t just a pair of headphones. This is your chance to design the future. We’re creating a community for developers to build apps of their own creation on the open source, Android platform. We have two different developer’s kits that will put you in the mix with our staff and automatically enrolls you hackathons, giveaways, and more.

“Just as Pebble built an audience of developing enthusiasts when it first launched, so Optinvent hopes to do the same for the ORA-X.”--Chris Davies, Slash Gear

How does ORA-X work?
You
can interact with the ORA-X through a touchpad or via voice commands to play music, launch applications, navigate
menus, and take pictures or video.

The ORA-X is an Android computer in
the shape of stylish headphones and includes a retractable see-through projection display.
The virtual video content will be overlaid on the
environment, AR style.  The ORA-X is not an immersive device that will block the
outside world.
It is a mobile device that lets you enjoy
audio and video content and run applications wherever you go.
 Two ModesORA-X AR Headphones have an adjustable display and camera
that can be placed in front of the eye or pivoted up and out of the way changing them into a traditional
Headphones.Furthermore, the display arm rotates 180° so you can use the ORA-X on the right or left side.

ORA-X is the perfect companion for music lovers on the go.  Not only can you listen to your favorite music with high fidelity audio wherever you are, 
but you can also watch visual content on the go, see notifications, and much more with the see-through AR display and Android OS. ORA-X is a new platform, its 
applications will grow, helping and entertaining in ways we haven’t 
yet imagined.












Experience ORA-X


This is how people react to the ORA-X when they try it.  Results guaranteed ;-)
Shot at TechCrunch Disrupt in SF on the 21st of September:





The Details
We’ve designed the ORA-X to handle the most challenging augmented reality applications with ease. Powered by a dual core processor with GPU, it features a capacitive touchpad, camera, microphone, and inertial and ambient light sensors. Integrated Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS last for hours thanks to its high capacity rechargeable battery. 





















Impressive Tech & Design at an Affordable Price
Early birds will be the first to get the ORA-X for nearly half off the retail price.  The other pledge levels also offer a great savings over what the ORA-X will sell for in retail.  This is our way of saying thank you to our Indiegogo backers.  The MSRP of ORA-X is planned to be around $600 when it launches. The special Luxe edition features a fashionable color scheme in white, aluminum, and blue/gray leather and comes complete with its own docking stand for charging and linking the ORA-X.  A total value of $700 that we're offering to our Indiegogo backers for $549.  That's a savings of $150!








Where We’re At
With the industrial design and first electronic board complete and manufacturers in place, we are ready to go to production once we have your support. Right now, we are looking to build up our developer community, design easy to use, ready to go apps for the ORA-X and launch a terrific app store. The most exciting part about supporting this campaign? You’re helping to revolutionize the future of  augmented reality because we want your input! Your contributions will help fund:

Frequently Asked Questions


How can I reach you?
You can send us any questions, concerns, or ideas directly through Indiegogo or email us at contact@optinvent.com
Where will you ship to?
We ship worldwide!
What’s the battery like?
A 2000mAh battery powers the ORA-X, and the battery life will vary based on how it’s used--just like any other mobile device. Camera, WiFi, and GPS will consume battery when left on, but we estimate the average battery life to be eight hours. 
How do I re-charge the ORA-X?
The standard ORA-X recharges with a micro USB, and the Luxe edition comes with a docking stand.
Will the ORA-X display hurt my eyes? 
The ORA-X is not different from any other monitor or projection device -- ideal use is not recommended.

What if I have a vision problem?
The ORA-X compatible with most eyewear so you can use it while wearing your own glasses.  Contact lenses are of course no problem.
How do I type on the ORA-X?
We’re developing a program called EyeSpeech with partner called Telepath Eye. The program will type using a corousel input method with the touchpad to allow for more fluid text input. 
What is “pass through mode”?
As a user, you can choose to employ this mode so that you’re not isolated from the environment. The ORA-X uses the microphone to take in ambient, environmental sounds to keep you safe. 
What version of Android does the device run and how do firmware updates work?
Our prototypes are currently running on Android 4.4.2.  This may or may not be upgraded by the time we launch.  If we do upgrade the firmware after launch, we will notify you and send instructions on how to update the firmware easily.  Currently we don't have OTA firmware upgrade capabilities but this may be possible in the future.
Can I get a refund?
Your contribution and pledge to our campaign is non-refundable and binding. We will abide by Indiegogo’s policies in case of conflict. 





Why
did your funding goal change?

We had quite a few people ask us if we would still make the ORA-X if we
didn’t reach our funding goal.  In order to dispel those concerns we asked
Indiegogo to change our funding goal and they agreed to do so. The goal does
not in any way affect our ability to manufacture ORA-X or fulfill your perks.
It should just gives more confidence to existing and new backers that we are
dedicated to making the ORA-X a reality. We chose to run a “Flexible
Funding” campaign, meaning everyone will get their perks with or without a
goal.",32.0,3,"1 Campaign

Records in downtown Berkeley, California.  After a seven year run in Albany, I moved the studio to its present location.  I've been here for nearly seven years as well, and most of the original equipment, especially the mixers, have started to make the transition from ""vintage,"" to ""garbage.""</p><p>Having recently had the opportunity to work extensively with the Behringer X32 mixing console, I realized the potential value this piece of equipment could add to my client projects.  The backbone of this Studio Retool plan is to replace both of my mixing consoles with either the Behringer X32, or perhaps its bigger, studio version, the Midas M32.  If funded, this campaign will begin a complete rewire of the studio, with one of these cutting-edge consoles at its heart.</p><p>As many of my clients are mid-project right now, I didn't want to raise my rates and force this update.  So I am offering blocks of studio time at a discounted rate, to be used to complete and existing projects or even start a new on on the new gear.</p><p>There was one goal when I started Skeptical Records and Artspoke Recording Studios almost fifteen years ago in the Northern California East Bay.  That goal was, and still is, to bring the power of the recording studio to independent musicians, building on my musical and technical nature, training, and experience.  My clients have provided the motivational and financial support that has brought the studio to where it is today.  It is my hope that  sharing this opportunity to be involved with the upgrades in the studio will continue to provide me and my clients with the  most bang for our buck.</p><p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p><p>I'm pre-selling studio time, in discounted blocks, to upgrade the studio's mixing console.  If funded, the studio will close down for several days in early March of this year to facilitate the wiring in and commissioning of the new mixing console and potential support gear.</p><p>The first goal to hit is $3500.  This would provide enough money and time to remove my existing 1979 Tascam M520 mixing console, and purchase the Behringer X32 and the proper cabling and connectors to wire it into the studio.</p><p>Should we hit the second goal,  $5000, I will purchase and commission the Midas M32 instead, which would provide similar recording and mixing support as the Behringer X32, but is made of higher quality components, and has some additional functionality.</p><p>Goal 3 is $7000.  This will allow enough time and budget for me to remove my 1979 Soundcraft Series 2400 mixing console as well, and convert that area of the control room to a more tailored sound creation and video editing suite.  Additional new gear at and above this goal

the studio, I am adjusting my role to focus more on my responsibilities with my label, Skeptical Records.  Not only will these discounted blocks of studio time help you save money on studio time, it

  As a tech and the owner of  dozens of pieces of vintage and space-age electronic equipment, my primary goal in making this upgrade to the studio is to add some horsepower to the heaviest lifting components, starting with the mixing console.  A new one means a 38-year leap forward in time and technology!  It will also replace my ADA converters, and has many other super powers that 1979 was just dreaming about.</p><p>The rewiring will be no small feat.  I have personally rebuilt and commissioned both of my vintage mixers more than once, and am the last to finally admit that their warmth and charm have honorably graced enough recording and mixing.  It will be emotionally difficult, for sure, but it will also represent more than a simple set of engineering challenges.   The M520 isn't too heavy, but most of the hundreds of connections coming to and from it will have to be rerouted and changed.  I will store it in my garage at home until I have the time to rebuild and sell it.  I have a separate business plan brewing to cut the Soundcraft into mic pre's and Eq's and sell them as individual ""lunch boxes"", but that's another story.</p><p>These two digital mixers, the X32 and M32, share the same Operating System, which is downloadable in the form of an application that runs on any computer.  This software is the same that controls every detail of every setting on the mixer, and save as many as you like to a thumb drive, which can then be uploaded into the mixer itself.  The software is available for free -- I have already downloaded and installed it, and created what will soon become my initial setups for the board, including color-coded, named channel strips, EQ and compression, and even headphone routing!  The very first thing I will do after unboxing the new mixing console, will be to plug in a thumb drive with my setup file, and set the entire console my way.  :)  I have a few presets already.  One is for testing all the new analog wiring

new clients are of course welcome!  I do plan to change the way I do business once this retool is complete, and will need everyone's help implementing changes in booking, scheduling, billing, funding, and accounting.  Odoo.com is a San Francisco company that provides amazing online project management tools, to which I will subscribe in March.  This will allow every project to keep its accounting,

time between March 15 and December 15, 2017.  Any discounted time block can be toward any single session, but only one block can be used toward any single session.  So if we have a 4-hour session, you could use one 3-hour block toward the session, and then just pay for the one other hour - and, the blocks will cover the more expensive/later hours.  More on the new studio booking and billing

High internal damping, reduce resonance</strong><br/>The 12mm acrylic is very suitable to make a speaker enclosure as it has high internal damping, sound wave hitting the acrylic panel is absorbed and sound wave reflection is stopped, making the mid-low frequency clean. Different materials have different resonance frequencies, resulting in different sound characters. Glass speaker has a natural tendency to ring, giving overly bright balance and the brittle sound. Acrylic speaker has great density which gives a non-resonant enclosure. The sound character is naturally warm, similar to peer wood. ONEclassic2 sounds like a high-end speaker with a spacious and involving sound.  </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484542832/jnppg3nesp4rke8uiua8.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>News: Innovative 5.1 TRUE WIRELESS SURROUND</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484542865/l4c3lrfcvrgvp1lugfzh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>We just launch a new campaign: <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/oneaudio/151555925?token=6bcddb09"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">World's only 5.1 surround without speaker wire &amp; power cord</a> of wireless personal surround theatre.</p><p>This system use the same DECT wireless technology of ONEclassic speaker, if you want to get some more than stereo enjoyment, you may go there for details.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484542937/xmubu8kxnhpxzckkqcc1.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>Production version</h3><p>ONEclassic2 is our production version of see-through speaker.

What are included in the speaker kit ?</strong></p><p>A pair of ONEclassic speaker, USB dongle for stereo play, 2 pcs 150W adaptor (110-220V) white colour and 2 pcs 1.5m power cord (you can choose of US, EU or UK plug)</p><p><strong>General: b. Which countries does DECT cover ?</strong></p><p>DECT covers 110 countries. Generally, DECT has 2 major regions: DECT6 for US, and EU DECT for Europe. Other countries like South America, Asian and Australia are supported. J-DECT is under development. Please specify your country in the order.</p><p><strong>General: c. How is the warranty ?</strong></p><p>We offer 15 months warranty from the date of shipment. We cover normal fail claim. You can ship back us at your expense, or we can send you spare parts for replacement.</p><p><strong>General: d. How durable is ONEclassic ?</strong></p><p>Acrylic is a highly durable material. It can last for 20 years. Long-time exposure in strong sunshine may destroy its transparency and extremely high humidity (&gt;90%) may shorten speaker driver life span.</p><p><strong>Operation: e. How can I use ONEclassic to setup surround system ?</strong></p><p>Surround is setup by 5 pcs of speakers and subwoofer. If you start with ONEclassic, you can place it as front speaker. Then, turn on 3 more speakers, any models of ONEaudio speaker. You can use our wireless subwoofer, or use a LFE receiver (ONEbox.bass) to connect its output to your active subwoofer. Then pair all speakers to a surround mode dongle or ONEaudio console box.</p><p><strong>Operation: f. What size of room does ONEclassic fit for ?</strong></p><p>ONEclassic fits for room size 8-40m2. Perfect size is 10-20m2. Different room size results in different character in tone absorption and reflection. You can use tone balance selection to control treble level. Generally, larger room needs more treble.</p><p><strong>Operation: g. Do I need to burn-in the speaker ?</strong></p><p>ONEclassic needs 100 hours burn-in to reach its steady state. 24 hours burn-in is done on our side. For each operation, ONEclassic needs about 10 minutes to warm up, sound will go smoothly afterward. Power off (by press power key) mode or standby mode does not affect warm up time. Please don’t plug out the power adaptor, you will need further 6 hour to warm up the adaptor.</p><p><strong>Operation: h. How do I manage volume control to get the best sound quality ?</strong></p><p>Player (eg. Window Media Player and iTune) volume is controlled by attenuate signal level; bit resolution is lost. Please keep player volume to maximum to retain full resolution.Use computer speaker volume (mixer volume)to do volume control. This is a volume command sent to speaker to change amplifier gain, bit resolution is kept unchanged. ONEclassic has volume up/down keys which control amplifier gain, bit resolution is also kept unchanged.</p><p><strong>Operation: i. What kind of music file is recommended for ONEclassic to play ?</strong></p><p>Raw wave file 44.1KHz 16bit ripped from CD is good enough for playing high fidelity music. We strongly advise not to use cooked file with sound processing, e.g. XRCD, LPCD or K2HD. Sound processing is added to high-resolution music files by up-sampling technique to generate a spread sound stage, good for headphone but bad for speaker. Stream audio (Youtube, Spotify) has high data compression, strong sound effect is being added to compensate detail lost in compression.</p><p><strong>Operation: j. How does the play device affect the sound ?</strong></p><p>Generally, play device, like WinPC and iMac, should play music at the same quality. Only a bit difference in sound character : Win PC will play sound balance and full detail, iMac will play sound soft and comfort. Smart device (iPhone or Android phone) may play in a bit low quality,sound quality mostly depends on USB audio clock stability.</p><p><strong>Operation: k. How should I place the speakers ?</strong></p><p>Don’t put speaker on soft plane or hollow cabinet. Speakers should be put 1.2-2.0m apart, ear level height, at less 0.2m away from the rear wall. Use of speaker stand is prefect, metal speaker stand will have bright treble, wooden speaker stand will have soft mid bass.<br/>We tailor made a 24” speaker stand for ONEclassic. It is made of 25mm acrylic plastic of 21Kg each.Its sound character is in between wooden and metal stand. Please visit our web site for ordering.</p><p><strong>Operation: l. Can ONEclassic have more connections ?</strong></p><p>ONEclassic supports up to 3 transmitters, dongle or console box. Console box is a multi-input device to bridge up the speakers. Choice of input: WiFi, USB, Toslink and local RAM server. Console box is in the final stage development, it will be launched in December 2016.</p><p><strong>Others: m. Why does the conventional bi-wires speaker still have phase error problem ?</strong></p><p>Bi-wires speaker still have passive crossover filter inside. The only difference from single pair wire speaker is that HF and LF filter is separated. Those filters will induce phase error. Even if you use bi-amplifiers to drive the speaker, phase error problem cannot be removed.</p><p><strong>Others: n. Why does ONEclassic use Class D amplifier ?</strong></p><p>Class D amplifier is not commonly used in audiophile grade product. Class D amplifier has excellent power efficiency, high damping factor (new generation closed loop Class D amplifier), low microphonic pick up and low sensitivity to power supply quality. Class D has ‘straight’ transfer character.Slightly distorted signal going to amplifier results in very poor sound. We need to make sure signal is perfectly undistorted so as to deliver clean and pure sound.</p></div>","We are the world's first to use DECT technology in Hi-Fi grade audio. You can follow our previous campaigns:ONEclassic: 4K DECT speaker that sound 200K setupONEmicro: The most natural audiophile speaker, big sound in small bodyIntroductionMany people are looking for see-through speaker to fit their home décor. 2 well-known brands (Waterfall and Crystal cable) use glass to build see-through audiophile grade wired speaker, price is extremely high (USD50-100K) that most of us can’t afford.We don’t like glass because of its brittle sound, pale green edge and risk of breaking down. Glass might even cause danger in shipping. Therefore, we use an expensive and safe material, Acrylic, to make the speaker cabinet, making them more like pieces of art instead of boxes of wood. ONEclassic2 blends in your interior, revealing your exclusive taste for innovation and design.   They love usAffordable see-through speaker1. Crystal ShinyWe use laser to cut 12mm acrylic panel with a 45° cutting edge. Each cutting edge is carefully polished to high gloss. Joint edges are single and create a multi-reflection of light, shining brightly under the sunlight. ONEclassic2 is both a pleasure to look at and listen to.  2. Purely colourless and fully transparentAcrylic is high quality material with 100% colourless, perfect match with any colour while glass is always tinted with pale green. Acylic is 360° fully transparent with shiny edge. You can see it straight through even from the narrow edge. For glass, you could not see what is behind the edge. You can easily fit ONEclassic2 into any house as an elegant décor.3. Neat wireless designExtra cables would only detract the elegant look and do little for the sound. Inside the speaker, you can clearly see the secret part, PCB, which is set firmly on the aluminum plate. Outside the speaker, there are no heat sink and bulky interconnection speaker cables.4. Safe and durableGlass speaker with sharp corners may cause danger, if knocked over could shatter. Acrylic is not fragile as glass. You can place your ONEclassic2 anywhere you like, no need to worry about breaking up into heaps of sharp pieces by your children or pets.Acrylic panels are bonded together by soften welding which softens the acrylic surfaces so that they merge to one piece. This chemical bond formed by soften welding is much stronger than the physical bond by gluing, giving them more than 20 years life span.5. High internal damping, reduce resonanceThe 12mm acrylic is very suitable to make a speaker enclosure as it has high internal damping, sound wave hitting the acrylic panel is absorbed and sound wave reflection is stopped, making the mid-low frequency clean. Different materials have different resonance frequencies, resulting in different sound characters. Glass speaker has a natural tendency to ring, giving overly bright balance and the brittle sound. Acrylic speaker has great density which gives a non-resonant enclosure. The sound character is naturally warm, similar to peer wood. ONEclassic2 sounds like a high-end speaker with a spacious and involving sound.  News: Innovative 5.1 TRUE WIRELESS SURROUNDWe just launch a new campaign: World's only 5.1 surround without speaker wire & power cord of wireless personal surround theatre.This system use the same DECT wireless technology of ONEclassic speaker, if you want to get some more than stereo enjoyment, you may go there for details.Production versionONEclassic2 is our production version of see-through speaker.

All-in-one, Simple and easyThere is no more amplifier or CD player. All you need is just a small USB dongle which streams high quality audio from PC or mobile device. Now, you can simply play audiophile music from your smart phone. Spend less time setting up speakers and more time listening.    2. More than stereo  Not only HiFi quality, DECT technology can also support multi-channels concurrent transmission. ONEaudio successfully developed the world’s first true wireless 5.1 surround. This can be formed by combining the ONEclassic2 and any models of ONEaudio wireless speakers.    3. Firmware upgradeA USB port is equipped in ONEclassic. You can use your WIN/PC to upgrade the speaker through the USB port. We will provide free upgrade for forward compatibility and sound improvement.What’s new in ONEclassic2 You might like to know more about ONEclassic before you look into new design in ONEclassic2.  For more details about ONEclassic technical aspect and design concept, please browse ONEclassic campaign .1. Improved structural design, a sense of art Every acrylic piece is cut at 45° by laser, then polish each cutting edge to give crystal shinny outline. Every cabinet is handmade by our craftsman and every single edge is carefully polished to ensure a smooth edge and shininess. 2. Powerful amplifiers, more accurate soundPowerful amplifiers with higher current output are used to improve the damping factor. Higher damping factor helps ONEclassic 2 to deliver a fast and solid bass, perfect for jazz and classical music. 3. Audio grade adaptor, clean and silent background Quality of power supply is critical to sound quality. We upgraded the power adaptor to audio grade, having lower noise level and higher instant current. With the audio grade adaptor, ONEclassic 2 has more silent and clean background.4. Improved power circuit, better punching bass We doubled the capacitance of power reservoir to give higher instant current supply to amplifiers. We used more metalized capacitors on each group of power line. We re-layout PCB to achieves power feeding lines have equal sharing of power.5. New tweeterONEclassic 2 features a silk dome tweeter. The silk dome has low distortion and higher frequency response. The tweeter is covered by anti-magnetic shielding to reduce electromagnetic emission.6. New firmwareWe did lot of changes to improve the DECT audio sound: more accurate timing, more precise filters, higher resolution signal depth, more reliable wireless connection, more routing flexibility, lower current consumption result of lower spurious emission, and some minor changes. 7. Longer communication range Our radio engineers redesign antenna matching circuit, communication range is improved by 20% range up to 30m. SpecificationRadio band : 1.9GHz DECT Channel Air codec : OPUS 480Kbps lossless Drivers : Celestion 6.5"" paper cone woofer Heco 2"" silk tweeter Cable : ϕ3.5mm 120 strands pure copper wire ϕ2.5mm 20 strands silver coated wire Size : 350 (H) x 200 (W) x 285 (D) mm Weight : 10.5kg (23lbs) per speaker Adaptor : 24V6A 150VA with PFC, input 110~220V Output power : 120W (80W woofer, 40W tweeter) per speaker Freq. response : 55-38000Hz Crossover freq. : 3.2KHz, 3.6KHz, 4.2KHz, 4.4KHz Distortion : Amplifier output 0.007% @1KHz Acoustic output 0.1% @1KHz, 0.06% @10KHz Power consumption : Standby power 0.25W Playing 120% of power output @Po>40W Audio mode support : Stereo, surround Transmitter support : 3   The teamPress kithttps://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0AjtvTudGvdZk1zblo5aFpYTVURisks and challenges1. ONEclassic is handmade product, it might have deviation on workmanship, we will keep it at highest standard.2. Qualification process is completed, major components are ready, only have a very low risk of shipment delay.3. The recipient is the importer of the shipment and must comply with all laws and regulations of the destination country. Orders shipped outside of Hong Kong may be subject to import taxes, customs duties and fees levied by the destination country. The recipient of an international shipment may be subject to such import taxes, customs duties and fees, which are levied once a shipment reaches the recipient's country. Additional charges for customs clearance must be fulfilled by the recipient; ONEaudio has no control over these charges, nor can we predict what they may be.4. Customs policies vary widely from country to country; backer should contact your local customs office for more information. When customs clearance procedures are required, it can cause delays beyond our original delivery estimates. However, ONEaudio is happy to provide any assistance wherever possible.FAQGeneral: a. What are included in the speaker kit ?A pair of ONEclassic speaker, USB dongle for stereo play, 2 pcs 150W adaptor (110-220V) white colour and 2 pcs 1.5m power cord (you can choose of US, EU or UK plug)General: b. Which countries does DECT cover ?DECT covers 110 countries. Generally, DECT has 2 major regions: DECT6 for US, and EU DECT for Europe. Other countries like South America, Asian and Australia are supported. J-DECT is under development. Please specify your country in the order.General: c. How is the warranty ?We offer 15 months warranty from the date of shipment. We cover normal fail claim. You can ship back us at your expense, or we can send you spare parts for replacement.General: d. How durable is ONEclassic ?Acrylic is a highly durable material. It can last for 20 years. Long-time exposure in strong sunshine may destroy its transparency and extremely high humidity (>90%) may shorten speaker driver life span.Operation: e. How can I use ONEclassic to setup surround system ?Surround is setup by 5 pcs of speakers and subwoofer. If you start with ONEclassic, you can place it as front speaker. Then, turn on 3 more speakers, any models of ONEaudio speaker. You can use our wireless subwoofer, or use a LFE receiver (ONEbox.bass) to connect its output to your active subwoofer. Then pair all speakers to a surround mode dongle or ONEaudio console box.Operation: f. What size of room does ONEclassic fit for ?ONEclassic fits for room size 8-40m2. Perfect size is 10-20m2. Different room size results in different character in tone absorption and reflection. You can use tone balance selection to control treble level. Generally, larger room needs more treble.Operation: g. Do I need to burn-in the speaker ?ONEclassic needs 100 hours burn-in to reach its steady state. 24 hours burn-in is done on our side. For each operation, ONEclassic needs about 10 minutes to warm up, sound will go smoothly afterward. Power off (by press power key) mode or standby mode does not affect warm up time. Please don’t plug out the power adaptor, you will need further 6 hour to warm up the adaptor.Operation: h. How do I manage volume control to get the best sound quality ?Player (eg. Window Media Player and iTune) volume is controlled by attenuate signal level; bit resolution is lost. Please keep player volume to maximum to retain full resolution.Use computer speaker volume (mixer volume)to do volume control. This is a volume command sent to speaker to change amplifier gain, bit resolution is kept unchanged. ONEclassic has volume up/down keys which control amplifier gain, bit resolution is also kept unchanged.Operation: i. What kind of music file is recommended for ONEclassic to play ?Raw wave file 44.1KHz 16bit ripped from CD is good enough for playing high fidelity music. We strongly advise not to use cooked file with sound processing, e.g. XRCD, LPCD or K2HD. Sound processing is added to high-resolution music files by up-sampling technique to generate a spread sound stage, good for headphone but bad for speaker. Stream audio (Youtube, Spotify) has high data compression, strong sound effect is being added to compensate detail lost in compression.Operation: j. How does the play device affect the sound ?Generally, play device, like WinPC and iMac, should play music at the same quality. Only a bit difference in sound character : Win PC will play sound balance and full detail, iMac will play sound soft and comfort. Smart device (iPhone or Android phone) may play in a bit low quality,sound quality mostly depends on USB audio clock stability.Operation: k. How should I place the speakers ?Don’t put speaker on soft plane or hollow cabinet. Speakers should be put 1.2-2.0m apart, ear level height, at less 0.2m away from the rear wall. Use of speaker stand is prefect, metal speaker stand will have bright treble, wooden speaker stand will have soft mid bass.We tailor made a 24” speaker stand for ONEclassic. It is made of 25mm acrylic plastic of 21Kg each.Its sound character is in between wooden and metal stand. Please visit our web site for ordering.Operation: l. Can ONEclassic have more connections ?ONEclassic supports up to 3 transmitters, dongle or console box. Console box is a multi-input device to bridge up the speakers. Choice of input: WiFi, USB, Toslink and local RAM server. Console box is in the final stage development, it will be launched in December 2016.Others: m. Why does the conventional bi-wires speaker still have phase error problem ?Bi-wires speaker still have passive crossover filter inside. The only difference from single pair wire speaker is that HF and LF filter is separated. Those filters will induce phase error. Even if you use bi-amplifiers to drive the speaker, phase error problem cannot be removed.Others: n. Why does ONEclassic use Class D amplifier ?Class D amplifier is not commonly used in audiophile grade product. Class D amplifier has excellent power efficiency, high damping factor (new generation closed loop Class D amplifier), low microphonic pick up and low sensitivity to power supply quality. Class D has ‘straight’ transfer character.Slightly distorted signal going to amplifier results in very poor sound. We need to make sure signal is perfectly undistorted so as to deliver clean and pure sound.",36.0,2,"1 Campaign

<span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;'>What's wrong with my phone's headphone jack?</span><br/>
</h4><div>
<p>You like going places and listening to music. You pack lightly when you travel, because it’s all about the experience and ease. You don't want to carry a separate music player for two reasons—first, they are expensive, and second, you already have your phone! So, you load your music onto your phone, pack your favorite headphones and go!</p>
<p>But, when you plug your awesome headphones into your phone, something’s not right. Something's missing from your music. It sounds caged-in. It lacks impact, clarity, and emotion. Your music just isn't ALIVE.</p>
<p>The truth is that phones, laptops and tablets aren't designed by musicians and your phone is not an audiophile device! It was designed with the average consumer in mind, so it includes mid-grade parts to save costs.What a bummer! You hear the sound quality difference, and this gets very frustrating! </p>
<p>Fortunately, there is an answer.</p>
<p>It’s called DACportable and it comes from CEntrance, a leader in personal audio. For the last 15 years we've built equipment for recording studios, performance stages and broadcast facilities worldwide. We've designed mixing consoles, recording equipment, and home stereo systems for music professionals – the most demanding ears out there.</p>
<p>DACportable is the answer to bad portable sound. We packaged an awesome audio system inside a small but durable anodized aluminum case! Now you can listen to music in a whole new way using your phone, tablet, laptop or desktop. DACportable will breathe new LIFE into your music.</p>

<h4>
EQ side controls </h4>
<div>
<p>Let's take a look at the user controls. On one side, you can access our legendary <b>HiFi-M8</b> EQ. Users of our flagship HiFi-M8 DAC report that these controls are the ""hidden gem"" of that product. We also feature them in DACportable. The Bass Kicker switch offers a slight, precisely dialed amount of added bass impact. The Top Extender is designed to add a silky-smooth, musical extension at the very top of the audio range. Both controls operate in a subtle way to gently enhance the listening experience and provide better matching to your headphones. In the OFF position, the EQ is bypassed, so your music remains completely unchanged.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456339093/o7y0mhvl6mhavnzz8kp4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span>Moving over to the power side, we see the Charger input on a standard USB Micro A jack, the Power button and the gold-plated 3.5mm Headphone jack. Above the power button, the four LEDs indicate battery status. When charging DACportable's internal battery, the Charger input should be connected to a 5V / 2.1 A wall power supply (such as the one that comes with iPad). This input works only for charging.
</span></p>
<h4><br/></h4>
<h4>Volume Side Controls</h4>
<p></p>
<p>On the opposite side, we see the analog Gain Switch that features 20 dB of gain adjustment, allowing you to use the output for headphones or for line output, and a Volume Knob featuring digital tracking, for perfect channel balance. The volume control is designed with ergonomics in mind and positioned to facilitate easy, one-handed adjustment, while on the move.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456339784/xdobzejpewzfhlw9nali.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
On the remaining side we see the second USB Micro A jack for connection to audio sources and a Streaming Light that comes on when audio is playing. Note that DACportable doesn't take any power FROM the connected source device, such as phone or tablet, nor does it provide power TO the connected device. DACportable is power-neutral. It uses its own rechargeable battery and doesn't ""steal"" any power from the phone, allowing you to enjoy hours of uninterrupted music playback.</p>

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">You are probably wondering what's under the hood. No problem! We don't mind sharing. </span></p>
<div>
<p><b>Upgraded Power</b></p>
<p>DACportable takes 5V from a USB charger and filters the living daylights out of it before it gets to the audio circuitry, to make sure all noise is kept out of your music. Internally, DACportable has seven power supplies and multiple filter stages, creating different voltages to power its high-end digital and analog circuitry.</p>
<p><b>Upgraded Amp</b></p>
<p>During the very successful <b>HiFi-Skyn</b> design effort, we developed <b>Amp Extreme</b>, a headphone amplifier circuit that delivers high power and ultra low distortion, making headphones sing loud and clear. DACportable has Amp Extreme built in! </p>
<p><b>Upgraded DAC</b></p>
<p>DACportable also shares the DAC chip with HiFi-Skyn. We use the brand new AK4490 from AKM. CEntrance is an official 3-rd party developer for AKM, so not only do we have access to best parts, but we also know how to use them.  Analog circuitry is known as ""black art"", but we've perfected it over the last 15 years.</p>
<p><b>Upgraded USB</b></p>
<p>The asynchronous USB interface is handled by the brand new XMOS U8 chip. CEntrance is also a 3-rd party development house for XMOS. We help them build their parts into other companies' products and this gives us unprecedented level of support straight from the chip developers. Naturally, you can depend on our tech.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4>Designed For Any Headphones
</h4>
<p>Some headphone models remain customer favorites due to their special sonic signature. Yet, these headphones are not efficient enough to be driven directly from the cell phone. A powerful amplifier is needed. And the amp needs a power supply. This is why die-hard audiophiles carry stacks of gear—batteries, DACs, and amps:</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456467251/zdotexolstkztpnn2stj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>DACportable changes all that. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Our past products were powered from USB. But the amount of USB power is limited, making it hard to achieve really loud output. In such products we always had to make compromises on output power. Now that we have an internal battery, we can really amp it up for most demanding headphones. DACportable pumps out enough power to drive almost anything!</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Which Headphones should I use?</h4>
<p>We get that question a lot. You are in luck. You can use pretty much any high-end headphones. Because DACportable has a powerful headphone amp, it will match up not just with the ultra-sensitive IEMs, but also with the high-end models from AKG, Audeze, Beyerdynamic, Fostex, HiFi-Man, Master and Dynamic, Mr. Speakers, Sennheiser, and many others. Very few DAC/Amps can boast this kind of performance, but DACportable can! </p>
<p></p>
<p>We engineered DACportable to take the digital signal out of your phone, tablet of computer, process it and convert it to analog using the same technology found in our award-winning audiophile products, and amplify it to a powerful, crystal-clear signal that will drive any headphones, with pristine highs and powerful bass.</p>The CEntrance DACportable is an awesome sound card inside a small lightweight case. It delivers your music in unmatched audio fidelity and on top of that, packs a long-lasting battery! DACportable is perfect for those extended shifts at work, while working out, on long flights, or at home, when you need some quality tunes but the phone's own buzzy sound just wouldn't cut it.<br/><p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h4>Your iPhone is no Match for Your Cool Cans</h4>The smartphone is a great digital music player, but its headphone jack sucks! You may have awesome headphones, but your iPhone won’t get the best out of them—the sound will be muddy, lack clarity and punch, to say nothing about feeble bass.<br/>If you are into audio quality, these headphones are the real deal. But your iPhone doesn't support these headphones. That's the problem we solve with DACportable.<br/><p><br/></p>

<h4>Risks and Challenges</h4>
<p>We are proud to say that this is our fourth Indiegogo campaign. Every time it's a learning experience and we are getting better and better with each one. The benefit to you, the customer, is that you are dealing with a company that has gone through this process more than once and has hundreds of satisfied customers from our previous campaigns. We know how to deliver. We are ""driven to ship"".  Let us briefly share what we've learned, so you could see how we improved over time.</p>
<p>
<br/></p>
<p>The key to campaign success is <i><b>simplicity  </b></i>and <i><b>predictability</b></i>.</p>
<ul><li>Our latest campaign for <b>DACport HD</b> only took 3 months from start to finish. This is unheard of in the industry, but we did many things right. The product was based on existing technology, prototyping had been complete before campaign start, and no third parties were involved. The result -- swift project execution and many satisfied customers. That's how we prefer to move forward.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Prior to that we ran the <b>HiFi-Skyn</b> campaign<b>.</b> That one took a little longer because we had to obtain permissions from Apple, Inc. Today, that's all behind us. We have delivered the bulk of the units to customers and are finishing up. Users are very happy and report that the wait was worth it. Lesson learned? Don't rely on 3-rd party approval. Find a way to ship without it. In this new campaign we will do just that -- we won't be waiting for third parties.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Our very first campaign was called <b>MixerFace</b> and that's where we had to do the most learning. The product was too complex, the design wasn't done when we started, customers kept requesting additional features. All of that has snowballed, creating unfortunate delays. Lesson learned? Don't bite off more than you can chew. Go simple, go fast. In this campaign, we are using existing technology, proven in previous products, so challenges are minimized.</li></ul>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We have a goal of shipping units in July 2016. Your support will help us speed up mass-production, acquire parts, and hire additional manpower to get units shipping asap.  If we don't meet the funding goal, we will still continue with the project and will bring this revolutionary product to market. We believe in this product concept and will make it happen. We've done this on our own with DACport, DACmini, HiFi-M8, and other products, but here we are looking to speed things up via crowd-funding. So speed is the main risk, which you can help mitigate by contributing today and sharing. Help us deliver the product as fast as possible!</p>

DACportable builds upon the legacy of our award-winning DACport Classic and adds the most requested features: Rechargeable Battery and Sonic Shaping filters. It comes from our team's years of experience in Audio Research and Development. This is our most advanced Personal D/A Converter and Amplifier, period. It will make your phones, tablets and computers sound their best without draining their battery!

What's wrong with my phone's headphone jack?

You like going places and listening to music. You pack lightly when you travel, because it’s all about the experience and ease. You don't want to carry a separate music player for two reasons—first, they are expensive, and second, you already have your phone! So, you load your music onto your phone, pack your favorite headphones and go!
But, when you plug your awesome headphones into your phone, something’s not right. Something's missing from your music. It sounds caged-in. It lacks impact, clarity, and emotion. Your music just isn't ALIVE.
The truth is that phones, laptops and tablets aren't designed by musicians and your phone is not an audiophile device! It was designed with the average consumer in mind, so it includes mid-grade parts to save costs.What a bummer! You hear the sound quality difference, and this gets very frustrating! 
Fortunately, there is an answer.
It’s called DACportable and it comes from CEntrance, a leader in personal audio. For the last 15 years we've built equipment for recording studios, performance stages and broadcast facilities worldwide. We've designed mixing consoles, recording equipment, and home stereo systems for music professionals – the most demanding ears out there.
DACportable is the answer to bad portable sound. We packaged an awesome audio system inside a small but durable anodized aluminum case! Now you can listen to music in a whole new way using your phone, tablet, laptop or desktop. DACportable will breathe new LIFE into your music.





We make it easy to listen to music in high definition. Rediscover your own music collection, or enjoy streaming from Tidal, Spotify, Slacker, Pandora, and many others. Now you can access amazing audio quality at a truly affordable price!

A Bit of History
In 2009 CEntrance was the trailblazer. We made audio history with the release of a revolutionary product called DACport. It defined the cutting edge in portable Hi-Fi and single-handedly created a new product category. DACport, a cigar-shaped D/A converter and headphone amplifier, delivered audiophile sound to any high-end headphones and gave thousands of people access to high-quality music.






DACport's amazing sound earned it a place on Stereophile magazine's highly coveted ""Recommended Components List"" for 6+ years. It was featured on the cover and received numerous industry awards. This is unmatched by any other brand! Here is what Stereophile's John Atkinson had to say about DACport:


               



A Classic, Remixed
Later, an updated version called DACport HD added High-Resolution audio and became smaller, lighter, and more ergonomic. DACport HD was crowdfunded right here on Indiegogo and sold thousands of units within months of introduction. 
  




Here is what our customers said about DACport HD:
The quality of my listening experience from Spotify with the M&D headphone paired with DACport HD is truly awe-inspiring. I cannot emphasize enough how amazing and how truly impressed and blown-away I am with the sound from DACport HD!
Dominique JamesCEntrance released many exciting recording and playback products. Products such as MicPort Pro and AxePort Pro, endorsed by the Hollywood elite. Products such as DACmini and HiFi-M8, named ""Best DAC ever tested"" by CNET:





Introducing DACportable
Today we are excited to introduce our most advanced portable DAC/Amp. The battery-powered DACportable. This is what our customers have been waiting for. 
People with phones and tablets love to listen to music. But no one wants to carry around additional equipment, such as amps and battery packs. Our quality-minded customers demanded a self-powered DAC/Amp. Today, we are proud to deliver.

Gone are external batteries. Gone are amplifier stacks. DACportable simplifies everything! Small and lightweight, jam-packed with Sonic Goodness, DACportable does it all. And yet, it's extremely travel-friendly. As frequent travelers ourselves, we designed it to pack well. Most importantly, this amp is really loud! Your headphones will be happy, and so will you!



DACportable is a lot like HiFi-M8, but much smaller and with full Hi-Rez support!
The CEntrance design team is known for its work with semiconductor leaders such as Texas Instruments, XMOS and AKM. We are listed on their websites as an official 3-rd party design firm. We have helped over 100 consulting clients such as Benchmark, Lavry, McIntosh, and Korg deliver great audio products to market.
When developing DACportable, CEntrance has taken advantage of our special relationships and utilized modern approaches to portable power and audiophile sound quality. Major advances in technology allowed us to achieve further miniaturization and sonic improvements. We put Hi-Fi in the palm of your hand.


What Does it Work With?
DACportable is designed to support a wide variety of digital sources, from laptops to desktops, to tablets, to phones. The unit is plug-and-play on Mac OS. As a famous driver developer firm, we have drivers for Windows XP through 10. Linux and newer Android devices are supported out of the box. iOS is supported as well!** You really cannot go wrong with DACportable. It will bring sweet music to your ears, no matter what you use for playback at work, at home, or in between.



Features at a Glance




Borrowing from our flagship products DACmini and HiFi-M8, we used expensive, audiophile-grade components such as resistors, amplifiers and power supplies to dramatically raise the bar on sound quality. DACportable makes it possible to truly enjoy hi-res files on your phone. Here are the main features:

             

Performance Parts




Most Awesome Headphone Amp. Clean, quiet and powerful Amp Extreme™, ""The best amp ever"", according to CNET.

Legendary HiFi-M8™ Analog EQ. Highlight the Bass and treble! Back by popular demand is our silky-smooth top extender and punchy bass kicker. 

Amazingly Musical DAC. Our premium, Velvet Sound DAC from AKM is used in the world's most expensive recording and playback gear.

Rotary Volume Control with 256 precision steps. Volume control with digital tracking keeps channels in perfect balance, always.




Technical Innovations
A Li-Po rechargeable battery delivers 8 hours* of sweet music to your ears.
Seven regulated internal power supplies provide full isolation from digital.
Two USB inputs: Charge the internal battery fast, while still playing music!
Two Picosecond clocks with JitterGuard™, our jitter removal technology.
Two output level settings - LOW for Line output and HIGH for Headphones.
The unit will auto shut-off when inactive. It's OK if you forgot to turn it off.





EQ side controls 

Let's take a look at the user controls. On one side, you can access our legendary HiFi-M8 EQ. Users of our flagship HiFi-M8 DAC report that these controls are the ""hidden gem"" of that product. We also feature them in DACportable. The Bass Kicker switch offers a slight, precisely dialed amount of added bass impact. The Top Extender is designed to add a silky-smooth, musical extension at the very top of the audio range. Both controls operate in a subtle way to gently enhance the listening experience and provide better matching to your headphones. In the OFF position, the EQ is bypassed, so your music remains completely unchanged.

Moving over to the power side, we see the Charger input on a standard USB Micro A jack, the Power button and the gold-plated 3.5mm Headphone jack. Above the power button, the four LEDs indicate battery status. When charging DACportable's internal battery, the Charger input should be connected to a 5V / 2.1 A wall power supply (such as the one that comes with iPad). This input works only for charging.


Volume Side Controls

On the opposite side, we see the analog Gain Switch that features 20 dB of gain adjustment, allowing you to use the output for headphones or for line output, and a Volume Knob featuring digital tracking, for perfect channel balance. The volume control is designed with ergonomics in mind and positioned to facilitate easy, one-handed adjustment, while on the move.


On the remaining side we see the second USB Micro A jack for connection to audio sources and a Streaming Light that comes on when audio is playing. Note that DACportable doesn't take any power FROM the connected source device, such as phone or tablet, nor does it provide power TO the connected device. DACportable is power-neutral. It uses its own rechargeable battery and doesn't ""steal"" any power from the phone, allowing you to enjoy hours of uninterrupted music playback.






Under the Hood
You are probably wondering what's under the hood. No problem! We don't mind sharing. 

Upgraded Power
DACportable takes 5V from a USB charger and filters the living daylights out of it before it gets to the audio circuitry, to make sure all noise is kept out of your music. Internally, DACportable has seven power supplies and multiple filter stages, creating different voltages to power its high-end digital and analog circuitry.
Upgraded Amp
During the very successful HiFi-Skyn design effort, we developed Amp Extreme, a headphone amplifier circuit that delivers high power and ultra low distortion, making headphones sing loud and clear. DACportable has Amp Extreme built in! 
Upgraded DAC
DACportable also shares the DAC chip with HiFi-Skyn. We use the brand new AK4490 from AKM. CEntrance is an official 3-rd party developer for AKM, so not only do we have access to best parts, but we also know how to use them.  Analog circuitry is known as ""black art"", but we've perfected it over the last 15 years.
Upgraded USB
The asynchronous USB interface is handled by the brand new XMOS U8 chip. CEntrance is also a 3-rd party development house for XMOS. We help them build their parts into other companies' products and this gives us unprecedented level of support straight from the chip developers. Naturally, you can depend on our tech.

Designed For Any Headphones

Some headphone models remain customer favorites due to their special sonic signature. Yet, these headphones are not efficient enough to be driven directly from the cell phone. A powerful amplifier is needed. And the amp needs a power supply. This is why die-hard audiophiles carry stacks of gear—batteries, DACs, and amps:



DACportable changes all that. Our past products were powered from USB. But the amount of USB power is limited, making it hard to achieve really loud output. In such products we always had to make compromises on output power. Now that we have an internal battery, we can really amp it up for most demanding headphones. DACportable pumps out enough power to drive almost anything!



Which Headphones should I use?
We get that question a lot. You are in luck. You can use pretty much any high-end headphones. Because DACportable has a powerful headphone amp, it will match up not just with the ultra-sensitive IEMs, but also with the high-end models from AKG, Audeze, Beyerdynamic, Fostex, HiFi-Man, Master and Dynamic, Mr. Speakers, Sennheiser, and many others. Very few DAC/Amps can boast this kind of performance, but DACportable can! 

We engineered DACportable to take the digital signal out of your phone, tablet of computer, process it and convert it to analog using the same technology found in our award-winning audiophile products, and amplify it to a powerful, crystal-clear signal that will drive any headphones, with pristine highs and powerful bass.The CEntrance DACportable is an awesome sound card inside a small lightweight case. It delivers your music in unmatched audio fidelity and on top of that, packs a long-lasting battery! DACportable is perfect for those extended shifts at work, while working out, on long flights, or at home, when you need some quality tunes but the phone's own buzzy sound just wouldn't cut it.

Your iPhone is no Match for Your Cool CansThe smartphone is a great digital music player, but its headphone jack sucks! You may have awesome headphones, but your iPhone won’t get the best out of them—the sound will be muddy, lack clarity and punch, to say nothing about feeble bass.If you are into audio quality, these headphones are the real deal. But your iPhone doesn't support these headphones. That's the problem we solve with DACportable.

We have a goal of shipping units in July 2016. Your support will help us speed up mass-production, acquire parts, and hire additional manpower to get units shipping asap.  If we don't meet the funding goal, we will still continue with the project and will bring this revolutionary product to market. We believe in this product concept and will make it happen. We've done this on our own with DACport, DACmini, HiFi-M8, and other products, but here we are looking to speed things up via crowd-funding. So speed is the main risk, which you can help mitigate by contributing today and sharing. Help us deliver the product as fast as possible!

platter, a squared wooden case and a complex piece of mechanics  - the 
tonearm - in such an old - style - furniture called 'Turntable'.</p><p>Days
 of horse - drawn carriages are  passed, at last, but the turntable with
 its basic design remained the same for about a century.</p><p>To 
revolutionize the classic turntable design with all its drawbacks, such 
as heavy weight, size, playing mechanism and vulnerability to vibration 
and to achieve the highest sound quality we concentrated on only the 
vital components, using high-quality materials.</p><p> The result is an 
engineering masterpiece producing playback audio quality, barely 
surpassed even by the most sought after turntables. In ATMO SFERA 
Turntable there is no gimmick accessory, it is solely focused on 
music-making components, with the finest Italian taste for industrial 
design.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463599449/a956c8fe30e186fbeeb1ba446ce21dd2_original_deoutl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463599496/cdaeb9da522e2a7f42485fcb491169d5_original_fxvdlk.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Here we reveal the golden key of achieving higher sound quality from a truly different design.</p><p>Imagine the turntable (EVERY turntable) as a <b>gigantic spring</b>;
 more the weight, the dimension etc. more the spring.
Every spring squeezes itself to absorb energy and so does the turntable;
 then it releases that energy causing buzzes, noises and muddiness in 
the audio range.
The simplest method the vast majority of the turntable designers use to 
avoid this is to add a <b>huge mass,</b> so: heavier platters, heavier turntable plinths and so on.</p><p>But
 -according to physics- there is a different mode to cope with  those 
undesirable effects: to reduce energy stored into the turntable base and
 into the turntable platter, the interfaces to the revolving 
long-playing record.
To achieve this goal we use a light platter, a very small, low-torque 
motor and leave the record freely floating (almost...) into air.</p><p>This
 (not so) simple trick gives to vibrations no free room to  flow through
 the mat and the platter, virtually disappeared in our design and to 
reach the turntable pickup
Even the most famous brands of commercial turntables in the market have 
not been able to solve this problem <b>But We Have</b>:</p><p>ATMO SFERA has the secret in its name: <b>Atmosphere in Space.</b>
 Atmosphere around us is the only Platter that does not generate energy 
back to the record because it uses the air as a Platter. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463599546/0b7aa09515f089412f705c444eaf0a55_original_e9vcd7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463599573/dac8e1642ed41cb70612d33c31265666_original_uclr7q.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>We designed the ATMO SFERA for everyone from the first - time record

create this delicacy in sound quality ATMO SFERA is designed by a team 
of Italian engineers, breaking boundaries by introducing a (almost) 
disappearing platter as a new paradigm in turntable design.Modern urban lifestyle simply doesn't need another gigantic round 
platter, a squared wooden case and a complex piece of mechanics  - the 
tonearm - in such an old - style - furniture called 'Turntable'.Days
 of horse - drawn carriages are  passed, at last, but the turntable with
 its basic design remained the same for about a century.To 
revolutionize the classic turntable design with all its drawbacks, such 
as heavy weight, size, playing mechanism and vulnerability to vibration 
and to achieve the highest sound quality we concentrated on only the 
vital components, using high-quality materials. The result is an 
engineering masterpiece producing playback audio quality, barely 
surpassed even by the most sought after turntables. In ATMO SFERA 
Turntable there is no gimmick accessory, it is solely focused on 
music-making components, with the finest Italian taste for industrial 
design.Here we reveal the golden key of achieving higher sound quality from a truly different design.Imagine the turntable (EVERY turntable) as a gigantic spring;
 more the weight, the dimension etc. more the spring.
Every spring squeezes itself to absorb energy and so does the turntable;
 then it releases that energy causing buzzes, noises and muddiness in 
the audio range.
The simplest method the vast majority of the turntable designers use to 
avoid this is to add a huge mass, so: heavier platters, heavier turntable plinths and so on.But
 -according to physics- there is a different mode to cope with  those 
undesirable effects: to reduce energy stored into the turntable base and
 into the turntable platter, the interfaces to the revolving 
long-playing record.
To achieve this goal we use a light platter, a very small, low-torque 
motor and leave the record freely floating (almost...) into air.This
 (not so) simple trick gives to vibrations no free room to  flow through
 the mat and the platter, virtually disappeared in our design and to 
reach the turntable pickup
Even the most famous brands of commercial turntables in the market have 
not been able to solve this problem But We Have:ATMO SFERA has the secret in its name: Atmosphere in Space.
 Atmosphere around us is the only Platter that does not generate energy 
back to the record because it uses the air as a Platter. We designed the ATMO SFERA for everyone from the first - time record 
listener to the audiophile vinyl enthusiast. You don't need to set up 
your cartridge or purchase additional outboard gear such as phono 
pre-amps, amplifiers. (although you have the option to). All of these 
are included in our integrated design.Turntable • Platterless design, a unique design where the record spins in air flawlessly and smoothly • Belt-Driven, Two speed (33/45 RPM) turntable

<h1>A Brave New Music Player World</h1>
<p>Digital music players have come a long way since the advent of the Apple iPod. It's not enough to just have a device that carries your music library with you anywhere you go. These days, people are looking for a digital audio player that delivers aesthetics, functionality and sound quality at a price point that impresses.</p>
<p>One such manufacturer that's been making waves with their line of digital audio players is Luxury &amp; Precision. Their most recent product, the L5 Pro, was highly praised for both its physical build as well as its incredibly sound quality. With over <a href=""http://www.head-fi.org/t/760848/new-and-improved-luxury-precision-l5-pro-32bit-dsd-dap-with-akm-ak4490-touch-screen-rosewood-blackplate"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">1,000 discussion posts</a> in its own thread and in-depth product reviews from members <a href=""http://www.head-fi.org/products/luxury-precision-l5-pro-32bit-portable-lossless-music-player/reviews/14254"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">twister6</a> and <a href=""http://www.head-fi.org/products/luxury-precision-l5-pro-32bit-portable-lossless-music-player/reviews/14302"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">cleg</a>, you can read all about the device on Head-Fi.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At north of $800, t<span>he
Luxury and Precision team was well aware that the L5 Pro did not cover the
entire spectrum of demand. They've been in the process of making a product that
builds on what they learned creating the L5 Pro while simultaneously dropping
the price to a more affordable level.</span></p>
<p>Luxury and Precision designed the L3 with many of the same great internal pieces as the L5 Pro and will be offering it when it comes to market at $400, a price point that's going to be hard to beat. </p>
<p>The company's been very encouraged by the western reception of their previous products, and to really get the word out and to help get manufacturing kicked off, Luxury and Precision will be offering <b>bold</b> early adopters a chance to get their latest and greatest product at the best prices it will ever be offered at.</p>

<h3><strong>Features</strong></h3>
<p>Luxury and Precision's line of products has really lived up to the name. Whether it was the LP5 or L5 Pro, the team sourced best-in-class components to ensure that listeners only get the latest and greatest. The L3 maintains this tradition and doesn't skip on the internals.</p>
<p>A main design consideration of the L3 was designing a product with an extremely low noise floor. At -115 dB testing with a 32 Ohm load, the distortion level was less than 0.0017%, providing a jet black background with even the most sensitive in ear monitors.</p>
<p>Flexible use case is an important function the Luxury &amp; Precision team took to heart. Armed with headphone out (3.5mm), balanced out (2.5mm), line out and SPDIF out options, it's got everything you need to plug in and play no matter what kind of setup you're currently rocking.</p>
<p>Of course, the L3 is balanced out done right. Equipped with a dual DAC, dual OP amp true balanced architecture, we've got pictures below for your viewing pleasure.</p>
<p>The L3 also comes with a USB DAC plug, allowing you to double up on its functionality and plug into a PC to take over sound functions and improve audio quality.</p>

<h3><strong>Design</strong></h3>
<p>The L3’s been in the works for a while now. In fact, before the original L5 was ever listed on the market, we were already in the process of hand soldering together an early test unit of the L3.</p>
<p>All three of the players use a 6-layer PCB stackup. The L3 and L5 Pro share many internal components while also maintaining the same digital circuit architecture.</p>
<p>In our opinion, an important step of creating a high quality DAP is to separate the digital and analog signals cleanly.  Digital circuitry is very noisy, whereas analog circuitry is vulnerable to noise. We accomplish this with different approaches in each of the devices.</p>
<p>In the LP5’s PCBA, the device separates the two in a vertical format. The top half of the PCB is a digital circuit while the bottom half consists of the analog circuits. Between the two is a ground plane.</p>
<p>The L5 implements this slightly differently. One entire side of the board is completely digital, while the other is entirely analog, and the wires are kept apart by a ground plane.</p>
<p>The L3 is designed specifically for use with sensitive IEMs, and the most important thing is design a device that maintains a jet black background free of noise. Because the L3 has a smaller area to work with, the circuits on the device are all on one side of the board. To avoid interference between the digital and analog circuits, we implemented a similar design to the LP5’s vertical division with multiple ground planes: There are two layers of ground planes in the digital circuits that help block interference, and three layers of ground planes in the analog circuits. In addition, the analog portion is shielded so that there’s no chance of external interference.</p>

<h3><strong>Measurements</strong></h3>
<p>Let’s start this section off by saying measurements don’t tell the whole story. Numbers are just a part of the whole, and having impressive measurements doesn’t ensure that the music you hear from a digital audio player will be reproduced faithfully.</p>
<p>But relying only on subjective impressions without any insight into how a device measures would just be taking a complete stab in the dark. We prefer to marry the two – design something that doesn’t have any glaring measurement issues, but also sounds good to our team’s ears.</p>

<h3><strong>Re: DAC Chip Choice</strong></h3>
<p>This was one of the more difficult choices that had to be made. We decided on using the CS4398. It's true that spec-wise, the SNR doesn't measure quite as well as other chips that have more impressive numbers, notably (and one that was previously up for consideration) the ES9018.</p>
<p>Here’s where our human subjective impressions came into play. The team didn’t like how the SABRE chip sounded with the player. After extensive testing and listening, we ended up choosing to implement the DAC chip that made the player sound the most open and natural. We hope after you take a listen that you'll agree with our choice!</p>

Digital music players have come a long way since the advent of the Apple iPod. It's not enough to just have a device that carries your music library with you anywhere you go. These days, people are looking for a digital audio player that delivers aesthetics, functionality and sound quality at a price point that impresses.
One such manufacturer that's been making waves with their line of digital audio players is Luxury & Precision. Their most recent product, the L5 Pro, was highly praised for both its physical build as well as its incredibly sound quality. With over 1,000 discussion posts in its own thread and in-depth product reviews from members twister6 and cleg, you can read all about the device on Head-Fi.

At north of $800, the
Luxury and Precision team was well aware that the L5 Pro did not cover the
entire spectrum of demand. They've been in the process of making a product that
builds on what they learned creating the L5 Pro while simultaneously dropping
the price to a more affordable level.
Luxury and Precision designed the L3 with many of the same great internal pieces as the L5 Pro and will be offering it when it comes to market at $400, a price point that's going to be hard to beat. 
The company's been very encouraged by the western reception of their previous products, and to really get the word out and to help get manufacturing kicked off, Luxury and Precision will be offering bold early adopters a chance to get their latest and greatest product at the best prices it will ever be offered at.




Features
Luxury and Precision's line of products has really lived up to the name. Whether it was the LP5 or L5 Pro, the team sourced best-in-class components to ensure that listeners only get the latest and greatest. The L3 maintains this tradition and doesn't skip on the internals.
A main design consideration of the L3 was designing a product with an extremely low noise floor. At -115 dB testing with a 32 Ohm load, the distortion level was less than 0.0017%, providing a jet black background with even the most sensitive in ear monitors.
Flexible use case is an important function the Luxury & Precision team took to heart. Armed with headphone out (3.5mm), balanced out (2.5mm), line out and SPDIF out options, it's got everything you need to plug in and play no matter what kind of setup you're currently rocking.
Of course, the L3 is balanced out done right. Equipped with a dual DAC, dual OP amp true balanced architecture, we've got pictures below for your viewing pleasure.
The L3 also comes with a USB DAC plug, allowing you to double up on its functionality and plug into a PC to take over sound functions and improve audio quality.



Design
The L3’s been in the works for a while now. In fact, before the original L5 was ever listed on the market, we were already in the process of hand soldering together an early test unit of the L3.
All three of the players use a 6-layer PCB stackup. The L3 and L5 Pro share many internal components while also maintaining the same digital circuit architecture.
In our opinion, an important step of creating a high quality DAP is to separate the digital and analog signals cleanly.  Digital circuitry is very noisy, whereas analog circuitry is vulnerable to noise. We accomplish this with different approaches in each of the devices.
In the LP5’s PCBA, the device separates the two in a vertical format. The top half of the PCB is a digital circuit while the bottom half consists of the analog circuits. Between the two is a ground plane.
The L5 implements this slightly differently. One entire side of the board is completely digital, while the other is entirely analog, and the wires are kept apart by a ground plane.
The L3 is designed specifically for use with sensitive IEMs, and the most important thing is design a device that maintains a jet black background free of noise. Because the L3 has a smaller area to work with, the circuits on the device are all on one side of the board. To avoid interference between the digital and analog circuits, we implemented a similar design to the LP5’s vertical division with multiple ground planes: There are two layers of ground planes in the digital circuits that help block interference, and three layers of ground planes in the analog circuits. In addition, the analog portion is shielded so that there’s no chance of external interference.

Measurements
Let’s start this section off by saying measurements don’t tell the whole story. Numbers are just a part of the whole, and having impressive measurements doesn’t ensure that the music you hear from a digital audio player will be reproduced faithfully.
But relying only on subjective impressions without any insight into how a device measures would just be taking a complete stab in the dark. We prefer to marry the two – design something that doesn’t have any glaring measurement issues, but also sounds good to our team’s ears.


Re: DAC Chip Choice
This was one of the more difficult choices that had to be made. We decided on using the CS4398. It's true that spec-wise, the SNR doesn't measure quite as well as other chips that have more impressive numbers, notably (and one that was previously up for consideration) the ES9018.
Here’s where our human subjective impressions came into play. The team didn’t like how the SABRE chip sounded with the player. After extensive testing and listening, we ended up choosing to implement the DAC chip that made the player sound the most open and natural. We hope after you take a listen that you'll agree with our choice!



Specs


16 GB internal memory, micro SD up to 128 GB
Digital to Analog Chip: Cirrus Logic CS4398
OP Amp: Crown 18120 (x2)
Headphone Amplifier Chip: Crown 1812A (x2)

Timeline, Risks and Challenges


Because manufacturing factories and times are already
secured, we anticipate that Luxury and
Precision will be able to deliver on the promotion very quickly.
We hope to start shipping out to backers by the end of April
but if we experience higher-than-anticipated demand or unforeseen manufacturing difficulties, the schedule may be pushed
out further to meet the team's rigorous quality expectations.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p> It's finally time to say goodbye to tangled wires and bulky headphones. The Truebuds team has developed a breakthrough wireless in-­ear headphone that fits comfortably in your ears and lasts 6 hours on a single charge, which is currently the longest battery life in the market. Use the portable charging case and get another full charge in only 45 minutes. </p>
<p>In early market testing, the two main pain points of current wireless earphones on the market were size and battery life. We took that to heart and optimized Truebuds to both be the smallest in the market and to have the longest battery life, in order to make the best completely cordless earbud out there.</p>
<p>The small size doesn't mean you should expect little in terms of sound quality. Here's what makes Truebuds sound great:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use of balanced armature audio transducers which offer very low noise distortion, and which are optimally tuned to specific frequency ranges.</li>
<li>Use of the AptX codec ensures that the sound you hear over Bluetooth is CD-like quality. AptX uses special bit rate reduction techniques to offer Bluetooth sound that is indistinguishable from corded headphones.</li>
<li>A proprietary-designed module creates ultra-low latency between both Bluetooth earbuds, so you hear exactly the same thing in both ears with no difference whatsoever.</li>
<li>An ambient noise cancelation module is included to make sure that when your Truebuds are in your ear, the music is all you can hear.</li>
</ul>
<p>Truebuds were designed with fashion and comfort in mind. They are the smallest Bluetooth earbud, which makes them fit inside your ear without any extra bulkiness. The metallic finish gives them a cool, futuristic look, so people will be asking you where you got those cool earbuds.</p>

<p>Yes. GAMO offers full 3D emulation with support for popular surround sound modes (7.1, 5.1, 5.0, 2.1, 2.0). In addition, the dual-drivers produces a fully immersive and three-dimensional experience.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>2. I’ve been burned in the past with Kickstarter and Indiegogo projects that either were very, very late, or never even shipped. What is my risk with the GAMO?</strong></p>
<p>Your risk is minimal because GAMO is beyond the research and development stage – GAMO is in the production stage! Currently, we are prepared to produce 5000 GAMO earphones and can only expect to produce more after the crowdfunding stage. The current prototype has been through 6 rounds of user-testing, and has begun the final stage of testing. Based on testing results, possible modification might be required. Additionally, while we fully expect to start shipments in November, we could experience some delays We are confident that you will experience GAMO very soon!</p>
<p><br/><strong>3. Does GAMO require additional plug-ins or softwares to deliver its 3D sound mode function?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely not! We understand that most gaming headsets or earphones make use of an external software or control unit for its surround sound function. That is why we worked very hard to produce GAMO, a pair of all-in-one gaming earphones that delivers top notch 3D sound quality.<br/><br/><br/><strong>4. Is GAMO compatible to all consoles and platforms?</strong></p>
<p>If you play games on multiple platforms, you are in luck! Use GAMO with any device with a 3.5mm output, including Nintendo Switch, Xbox, PS4, VR, and mobile devices. When you are using GAMO with PC and MAC, simply plug it in with the 3.5mm Audio Adapter Cable that comes with the box as part of the standard accessories pack.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>5. Does GAMO work after its battery runs out?</strong></p>
<p>If you are using it under the Music Mode, it does not require any battery. Only when GAMO is under 3D Game Mode or 3D Cinema Mode will it require battery. Even after the battery runs out, GAMO still functions as a pair of high quality hi-fi audio earphones.<br/><br/> </p>
<p><strong>6. What is GAMO’s warranty policy?</strong></p>
<p>To ensure a great experience,  GAMO has a 1 year warranty policy, promising to repair your GAMO when necessary.<br/><br/> </p>
</div></div>","In the world of high-intensity FPS, TPS and fast-paced racing games, you need a competitive advantage to take down your enemies. Meet GAMO, the world’s first exclusive gaming earpiece with 3D ReCutting™ Audio. With GAMO, you can truly hear your surroundings for the first time.  
GAMO is revolutionary because it tracks and locates critical sound details and delivers this information to your ears with a powerful dual-driver system. These details will help you find enemies, accelerate your decision-making and improve your chances of winning.





With other game headsets, you have a general idea of which direction your enemy is, but you couldn’t accurately locate them based on sound alone. Unlike the others, GAMO is the first game headset to utilize cutting-edge technology to take your audio experience to the next level. Forget about finding enemies based on estimation and instead pinpoint them with extreme accuracy. 

With GAMO’s advanced technology, feel like you’ve entered the digital world and truly immerse yourself in the game for the first time. Hear everything on the X, Y, and Z axis and hear everything even things outside your field of vision.





 

This 3D virtual algorithm is based on two sound sources – the left and right earpieces.
Although the traditional virtual algorithm is based on seven (or five) sources, your headphones can only pump out two of these fields (left and right), making it impossible to sense direction accurately.
Sound positioning is cranked out imprecisely by only separating the low, mid and high frequencies. This misses all of the essential frequencies you need to hear for an immersive experience.  
The algorithm individually processes different sounds into genres including footsteps, gunshots, and surrounding sounds.The system renders the rich details of the game world and creates a virtual audio space, allowing you to pinpoint every sound with dynamic accuracy. You will hear better, further, even differentiating the change of distance of your enemies. 





Most gaming headsets only use single driver technology. This essentially makes them one-trick devices and will fail to deliver the user an immersive, multi-directional sound. 
Dual drivers are the superior setup because they offer detailed layer separation, can produce sound at high volumes without distortion, and provide a dynamic range. In addition, audiophiles tout dual-driver headphones for their efficiency as the drivers work to separate different frequencies to each driver, resulting in an immersive, three-dimensional sound experience. If you demand the best quality sound in your games, you need a dual-driver system. 



GAMO features a novel game-changing material, graphene driver diaphragm, which is of unparalleled pliability and thinness. With GAMO’s graphene-drivers, you hear everything and every frequency on the spectrum. This means that the low-end sounds are punchy, the midrange sounds are clear, and the high frequencies are sharp without any tininess. 

GAMO is the perfect all-in-one audio solution for anyone that takes their games seriously but also consumes other forms of media. Built into GAMO are three modes: 3D Game Mode, 3D Movie Mode, and Music Mode. Switch between the three modes on the fly for the perfect listening experience.
GAMO gives you an edge on knowing where and what your enemies are doing. Allow your ears to pick out even the slightest details from footsteps to gunshots and environmental noises.



With 3D Cinema Mode, immerse yourself in your favorite movies and rediscover hidden audio clues you’d never heard before.
Once you hear your favorite songs with GAMO, you'll never want to use another pair of earbuds again.

The current prototype has been through 6 rounds of user-testing, and has begun the final stage of testing. Based on testing results, possible modification might be required. Additionally, while we fully expect to start shipments in November, we could experience some delays We are confident that you will experience GAMO very soon!
3. Does GAMO require additional plug-ins or softwares to deliver its 3D sound mode function?
Absolutely not! We understand that most gaming headsets or earphones make use of an external software or control unit for its surround sound function. That is why we worked very hard to produce GAMO, a pair of all-in-one gaming earphones that delivers top notch 3D sound quality.4. Is GAMO compatible to all consoles and platforms?
If you play games on multiple platforms, you are in luck! Use GAMO with any device with a 3.5mm output, including Nintendo Switch, Xbox, PS4, VR, and mobile devices. When you are using GAMO with PC and MAC, simply plug it in with the 3.5mm Audio Adapter Cable that comes with the box as part of the standard accessories pack. 
5. Does GAMO work after its battery runs out?
If you are using it under the Music Mode, it does not require any battery. Only when GAMO is under 3D Game Mode or 3D Cinema Mode will it require battery. Even after the battery runs out, GAMO still functions as a pair of high quality hi-fi audio earphones. 
6. What is GAMO’s warranty policy?
To ensure a great experience,  GAMO has a 1 year warranty policy, promising to repair your GAMO when necessary.",65.0,1,"1 Campaign

They are easy to use in virtually any environment and they look fantastic. This is yet another chapter in our effort to continuously improve MINFORT’s products and offerings to better serve our audience and give them the best audio experience as possible in a wide variety of situations and circumstances. We strive to make quality audio products that sound as good as they look, and that look incredible.● Real 12mm solid hardwood in Teak, Oak, Walnut, and Padauk. (NOT veneered)  ● A powerful amplifier boasting main channel : 10W + 10W and 20W sub-woofer .● “True Wireless”: Completely wireless speakers allowing for truly flexible, sonically perfect              placement whether close together or far apart.  ● The MIN628 offers 10+ hours of use per full battery charge (typical use case at mid-volume). ● Original beautiful design with Hi-Fi quality sound. The MIN660 is designed to be used as your primary indoor speaker. Hi-Fi quality, powerful sound that is convenient, flexible, and beautiful in virtually any indoor space.The MIN660 has 3 distinct sound chambers designed to reduce interference of sound between the main speakers and subwoofer. By reducing the interference, the sound is remarkably clear while distortion is minimized even at high volume. You’ll have to hear it to believe it.The subwoofer is located at the bottom of the speaker which is elevated from the underlying surface by gold-plated pyramid feet providing stability and clarity of low-frequency tones and a stylish accent to the design.Single adjustable subwoofer / Reflex enclosureThe reflex speed of the speakers is paramount for powerful bass that doesn’t distort or reverberate. To ensure tight and punchy bass, the MIN660 has a reflex enclosure which allows for a quicker, more precise, powerful output.Powerful bass isn’t for everyone or every situation. Jazz or classical music listeners may prefer a subtle bass level. Hip hop or funk listeners may prefer it to be more pronounced. The MIN660 features a single knob that allows for control of the 5.25 inch subwoofer to fit the listener’s preference.Above is a visual of the MIN660’s adjustable subwoofer located at the bottom of the speaker with a large 5.25” diameter.Demonstration MIN660 / Please adjust to high qualityDemonstration patented thumping bass/ Please adjust to high qualityThe Combination for a Thumping BassMIN660 embeds an amplifier board chips to power the 40W 2.1 stereo system. The unique 3 sound chamber design reduces interference between the subwoofer and main speaker, making the sound crisp and clear.Antenna to boost Bluetooth signalBluetooth speakers offer convenience and flexibility. The problem with many devices is when the source goes out of range. The connection cuts  in and out and ruins the listening experience.That’s why we’ve added a Bluetooth antenna jack to boost the Bluetooth performance. This means the connected device will stay solidly connected at a range up to approximately 60 feet (20 meters) without interruption or drops.The speaker operates perfectly fine without the antenna with a similar range to other Bluetooth devices as well, but the ability to increase the range is there if you want or need it.Half the size of the MIN7Minfort’s MIN7 is a powerful speaker beloved by our customers and the predecessor of the MIN660. However, the MIN660 replicates the same performance level of the MIN7 at near half the size of the MIN7. Small but mighty!The MIN660 packs the same punch as the MIN7 at half the size with the iconic design styling for which MINFORT is known. The MIN628 is designed as a high-end portable option. The stylish bronze handle makes it easy to carry anywhere you want to go. For those who want the quality of a high-end system in any environment, this is the speaker for you.The MIN628 is made to travel anywhere, but it sounds and looks good enough to be your primary indoor speaker. Plug it in and enjoy your favorite music in any room. When it is time to get outside, premium sound can come with you wherever you go.Demonstration sound quality / Please adjust to high qualityThe MIN628 also features a single knob that allows for control of the 3 inch subwoofer to fit the listener’s preference.With two distinct sound chambers, the different components are separated allowing the MIN628 to achieve a superior sound quality for a portable speaker.Iron bronze handleThe portability based on the size and convenient bronze handle makes it the perfect speaker to bring anywhere whether it is to the office, on vacation, or just outside with some friends.Replaceable batteryThe MIN628’s 1000mah lithium battery allows for 10+ hours of play on a single battery charge (when plated at mid-volume). That’s enough time to get through a whole day out with friends or through a night of partying without worrying about the speaker going dead. If there’s ever an issue with the battery, it can easily be replaced.True wireless paring min660 and min628​MIN660 and MIN628 can be connected by Bluetooth, which makes any movie scene more immersive.Most speakers need cables to connect. The MIN660 and MIN628 can easily connect wirelessly to the same source. You can combine multiple MIN660’s, multiple MIN628’s, or you can mix and match providing an immersive superior listening experience in virtually any environment.Handcrafted in Taiwan/ Elegant yet Simple/4 Wood OptionsThe speaker housings are handcrafted by the honorable senior carpenter, Master Shifu, who has over 30 years of carpentry experience and unparalleled skill. The product assembly, testing, and packaging are all done by hand in-house to ensure quality and care at every step.The housing is made from joined solid hardwood panels (12mm x 20 – 30mm width). Since we use real hardwood, each speaker has a unique pattern that is one of a kind, like a fingerprint.When designing the speakers, we had a very specific look in mind. One that would look elegant and cozy in the home. Our team and Master Shifu determined the best way to create a rich and glossy appearance that was also water and scuff resistant was to use a special transparent protective coating. This not only makes the appearance of the speaker more luxurious, but also ensures it will last and look great for years to come.（color for reference only）Teak A noble wood from Southeast Asia. It has high tensile strength, high oil content, and tight grain, which make it a durable and highly weather-resistant hardwood. It makes for an attractive option to house the speaker at the mid-range of the hardwood color palette.Walnut Walnut generally has a relatively straight grain that becomes wavy towards the root. The color can range from dark brown to an almost rich purplish-brown. It is resilient, decay resident, and holds its shape exceptionally well. These characteristics make it ideal for use in high-end furniture and cabinetry and make it an excellent choice for speaker housing.OakOak is a heavy, strong hardwood with a light coloration and a mostly straight wood grain. It becomes especially rich when finish is applied. It has a classic course texture and is highly durable, strong, and resilient with a beautiful appearance.Padauk     (color for reference only)Padauk is moderately heavy, strong, and stiff with exceptional stability. It has a unique dark reddish-orange hue which darkens to a rich reddish-brown color. It is extremely resistant to decay and is regarded as notoriously durable among the woodworking community.All the hardwood options are exceptionally durable and long-lasting. The choice comes entirely down to your taste and preference. There are no wrong answers!New ""600 series"" of MB design by William and Travis.The 600 series, including the MIN660 and MIN628, each contains 2 amplifier board chips that power the 40W 2.1 stereo system, a powerful amplifier with 10W + 10W tweeters & woofers and 20W subwoofer. The system utilizes Digital Signal Processing (or DSP) to enhance vocal processing. The result is loud, clear vocals that audiophiles crave. The MIN660 and MIN628 each have 2 silk dome tweeters, 2 paper cone woofers, and 1 subwoofer. These 5 drivers make for the loudest and clearest sound possible.
The silk dome tweeters give a crystal-clear sound on the high-range frequencies
The paper cone woofers produce loud, clear, and warm mid-range frequencies that allow for clear and discernable vocals with rich detail.
The polypropylene cone subwoofer creates powerful bass with low distortion. It is injection-molded with rubber yielding a high-strength bond between the cone and its surroundings.
Each driver types deliver different ranges of frequency. Though a woofer could produce a low frequency like that of a subwoofer, it would be of an inferior quality. Each driver is tuned specifically to deliver within the ideal frequency range for which it was designed. The combination of these three drivers makes for the perfect mix of components for the best clarity, accuracy, and overall audio experience.If you’ve ever heard a song on a sub-par system and then heard that song on a nice pair of headphones, you likely noticed a difference. Much of this difference has to do with the fact that high-end headphones are calibrated accurately to ideally project the various frequencies.Calibrating is an important process. If even slightly off, the sound quality will be noticeably disappointing. Many headphones and speakers on the market today are not calibrated accurately or even calibrated at all. That is why many have inconsistent and unpleasant performance that can sound wrong.
The high-frequencies are often too sharp, which can often feel piercing to the eardrum and generally unpleasant.
The bass is often too strong making the music sound generally distorted and difficult to hear clearly as the bass masks the other frequencies.
For this reason, we have experts tune our speakers so that all the rich detail of the music can be discerned and experienced. Nice, smooth, strong, punchy, and clear. That’s the listening experience from our well-calibrated speakers.   Specs for MIN 660:• 2 x Tweeter 1” 6Ω• 2 x woofer 3” 4Ω• Subwoofer 5.25” 4Ω• 40 watts amplifier• Bluetooth 4.2 version• USB player / flac, wav, mp3 files• Line in and out• Weight : 2.27lb• Dimensions:  12mm wooden panel (oak/teak/walnut/padauk)• Amplifying chip (put what chipset you used)Specs for MIN 628• 2 x Tweeter 1” 6Ω• 2 x woofer 3” 4Ω• Subwoofer 3” 4Ω• 40 watts amplifier• Bluetooth 4.2 version• USB player / flac, wav, mp3 files• Line in and out• Weight : 1.36lb• Dimensions: 12mm wooden panel (oak/teak/walnut/padauk)         We, Travis and William, are the co-founders of MINFORT.

</li></ul></h4>
<div>Probably not. We asked everyone what extra features they most wanted to see in the headphones and the top requests were over-the-ear cushioning for comfort, removable cord so the headphones can still be used if the cord ever gets damaged, and a mic for gaming. We've already included these features in the headphones that were originally supposed to be stretch goals only. We decided to go the extra mile and give everyone the features they wanted whether we reached our stretch goal or not.</div>
<div>Wireless and Bluetooth were not popular requests, however a lot of people asked for RBG LED lights. We originally wanted to add this as a stretch goal, but during prototyping tests, we noticed several issues that would make changing LED lights a bad feature to add. With single colored headphones, the clear plastic over the lights can be color tinted, so even in bright sunlight, the headphones will have vibrant color accents. With color changing LEDs, the clear plastic must be translucent white to allow different colors to shine through, but that also means the colors will be easily washed out in daylight. Adding more power to the LED doesn't help much since sunlight is extremely bright, and it will drain the battery very quickly. We can't just put in bigger batteries either, since the battery must power both LED lights and external cat ear speakers. Too many batteries will cause weight issues in the headphones and make them too top heavy. In the end, we decided it's best to have one single color per headphone that looks great no matter where you are versus many colors that will get washed out the moment you go outside. </div>

Please e-mail our customer service at AxentWear@brookstone.com with your full name, address, Indiegogo account name, and the details of your issue. We will put you in a special list to make sure you get what you intended to order. 



Will the headphones be wireless or have Bluetooth? Will it have changing RBG LED lights? What about as stretch goals?

Probably not. We asked everyone what extra features they most wanted to see in the headphones and the top requests were over-the-ear cushioning for comfort, removable cord so the headphones can still be used if the cord ever gets damaged, and a mic for gaming. We've already included these features in the headphones that were originally supposed to be stretch goals only. We decided to go the extra mile and give everyone the features they wanted whether we reached our stretch goal or not.
Wireless and Bluetooth were not popular requests, however a lot of people asked for RBG LED lights. We originally wanted to add this as a stretch goal, but during prototyping tests, we noticed several issues that would make changing LED lights a bad feature to add. With single colored headphones, the clear plastic over the lights can be color tinted, so even in bright sunlight, the headphones will have vibrant color accents. With color changing LEDs, the clear plastic must be translucent white to allow different colors to shine through, but that also means the colors will be easily washed out in daylight. Adding more power to the LED doesn't help much since sunlight is extremely bright, and it will drain the battery very quickly. We can't just put in bigger batteries either, since the battery must power both LED lights and external cat ear speakers. Too many batteries will cause weight issues in the headphones and make them too top heavy. In the end, we decided it's best to have one single color per headphone that looks great no matter where you are versus many colors that will get washed out the moment you go outside.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

Individual = Versatility and Freedom 
Encased = Ideal Outdoor Audio Solution 
 

Traditional wireless stereo speakers have wire between the left unit and the right unit, while our technology enables the pair to work with no visible string attached. Because our speakers are truly wireless, they can cover both big open spaces or small room flexibly with optimized true stereo sound.

The speakers can be used together to provide stereo sound up to 50 ft (15 meters) without any wires.
You can choose to link your GoDuo to play distinct synchronized stereo or have each speaker act as an individual device. Have complete flexibility and control over your sound.

Link for synchronized stereo

Unlink for individual playing

Our goal was to design an uncompromising high fidelity stereo experience that offers stunning audio at an affordable price. We're only working with the best in the business. Our speakers have been tuned by the former Director of Acoustic Engineering of Philips with the EQ tested and adjusted in the same audio lab that manufactures for SONY and Samsung.

<p>The acrylic glass was thoroughly polished to ensure smoothness and an ideal reflection effect.</p>

<p>For an artistic speaker like Gravity, excellent sound quality is crucial.</p>
<p>The unsymmetrical design has the support and display on one side of the speaker. To balance the structure, we added weight to the body, which created difficulty for the acoustic structure.</p>

<br/>
<br/><p>To produce a powerful and hifi quality sound from a small body has always been a problem in this industry. We worked with our engineers, who have 13 years of experience in audio products, our supplier, who is also supplier for Bose and JBL, and our partner acoustic experts Dirac from Sweden. We worked very hard to come up with the ideal solution for Gravity.</p>

Also from ""certain angles"" the whole speaker can look like it's floating. ——THE VERGEThe Gravity, then, is a symbol of Meizu's heritage of design and music. ——EngadgetSeeming to hover midair, Meizu's Gravity is the David Blaine of speakers.——YAHOO!TECH The design story about ""Missing Design"", told by Designer Kosho Tsuboi. The video was shot in Japan.

If you can't see the video, you can also watch the video here. 





















High quality acrylic glass guarantees a clear display and a low weight.



Aluminum body for superior texture.



Polyester fiber specially designed for high-end speakers. It's dust-proof and won’t diminish the transmitting of sound.



The acrylic glass was thoroughly polished to ensure smoothness and an ideal reflection effect.
The aluminum panel went through atomization to align its color with that of the mesh, which is wrapped tightly on the body, making it hard to tell the difference between these two materials.







For an artistic speaker like Gravity, excellent sound quality is crucial.
The unsymmetrical design has the support and display on one side of the speaker. To balance the structure, we added weight to the body, which created difficulty for the acoustic structure.




To produce a powerful and hifi quality sound from a small body has always been a problem in this industry. We worked with our engineers, who have 13 years of experience in audio products, our supplier, who is also supplier for Bose and JBL, and our partner acoustic experts Dirac from Sweden. We worked very hard to come up with the ideal solution for Gravity.





Customized
speaker units that improves the sound performance in limited hardware.


Passive
double resonant diaphragms + dual drive units = enhanced bass.


Reduced
distortion rate, made possible by the most advanced chip from Texas Instruments.

Re-creating
the original music scene, made possible by Dirac Power Sound of Sweden.

The Sphere microphone is a very high quality mic in its own right. One output of the mic is a forward facing cardioid and the other is a rear-facing cardioid. You can just connect the front output and use that as a conventional cardioid microphone, leaving the rear channel disconnected.</p><h5 style=""padding-top:20px;"">Is the Sphere L22 microphone digital or analog?</h5><p>The Sphere microphone hardware is entirely analog. The Sphere modeling technology occurs in the digital domain using an audio software plug-in, which supports UAD, VST2, VST3, AU and AAX Native. The UAD version can run on a Universal Audio Apollo with guaranteed low latency processing.</p><h5 style=""padding-top:20px;"">Can I use the Sphere microphone with any preamp I want?</h5><p>Yes, as long as it has 48V phantom power and two available channels; although we have some recommended guidelines which will generally produce the best results. We strongly recommend using a preamp with precision-matched gain controls, to make setting levels super easy.</p><p>Audio recording interfaces with digitally controlled preamps, such as the Universal Audio Apollo series (excluding Apollo 16), RME Fireface UFX, and the Apogee Duet or Quartet, are a great choice for use with Sphere. With these interfaces the gain between two channels can be linked, so equal level will always be maintained.</p><p>Pure analog designs with stepped attenuators, such as a Neve 1073 or a Millennia HV-3D, can also work very well, as long as they are not overloaded and are instead used in their linear range.</p><p>If the preamp has adjustable input impedance, we generally recommend using the highest setting, which in some cases can provide slightly better gain matching between channels.</p><p>Visit the <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><a href=""http://townsendlabs.com/prelist/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Recommended Preamps</a></span> page for a list of over 250 preamps and audio interfaces that have precision matched inputs.</p><h5 style=""padding-top:20px;"">Can I use the Sphere plug-in on material recorded with some other microphone?</h5><p>While there is nothing stopping you from doing that, the results will most likely be extremely poor. The Sphere microphone is specifically designed and calibrated to work with the plug-in. There are very tight tolerances on frequency response and polar response of the Sphere L22 microphone, so that the modeling is consistent from mic to mic. But even more importantly, the microphone is dual-channel, which encodes the directional information for the plug-in which would be entirely lost with a single channel microphone.</p><h5 style=""padding-top:20px;"">Does the included Sphere plug-in use copy protection?</h5><p>No copy protection is used.</p><h5 style=""padding-top:20px;"">How accurately are Sphere microphones matched?</h5><p>Generally, any two Sphere microphones are extremely well matched and can be used, with excellent results, as a stereo pair or for other critical applications. Nonetheless, for Indiegogo only, we are offering matched sets with even tighter matching that goes above and beyond what is normally available.</p><h5 style=""padding-top:20px;"">How accurate is Sphere microphone modeling?</h5><p>The Sphere microphone uses a large diaphragm condenser capsule, and is optimized to model large diaphragm mics most accurately. For vintage large diaphragm condenser microphones, in particular, our target is to meet or exceed the accuracy of currently available reissues, clones or other modern versions of the corresponding mic. In most cases we achieve or surpass that standard of accuracy.</p><p>For other types of microphones, such as dynamics, ribbons, and small diaphragm condensers, the models are generally accurate when used on-axis. Beyond about 45 degrees off-axis the models may deviate substantially, but still maintain the same overall polar pattern. Generally this means that for these models close miking will be more accurate than distant miking.</p><p>The Sphere microphone uses a capsule with very tight tolerances, so that the models will sound consistent no matter what mic hardware is used. These tolerances are typically much tighter than most current or vintage microphones.</p><h5 style=""padding-top:20px;"">Does Sphere technology model nonlinear distortion of microphones?</h5><p>Yes, it models the subtle harmonic characteristics of tube and FET mics, but it does NOT model the full overload characteristics. The Sphere microphone is designed to have a large amount of headroom and dynamic range, so it can handle a very soft and very high sound pressure levels. Our approach provides maximum headroom even if the original microphone being modeled doesn’t have as much headroom. We believe this is a major benefit of the technology, since an overloaded microphone is rarely a desirable thing.</p><h5 style=""padding-top:20px;"">Does Sphere technology model the noise and hum of microphones?</h5><p>No. The Sphere microphone is designed to have a very low amount of noise. This approach provides the user with the lowest noise possible, even if that is substantially lower than the original mic being modeled.</p><h5 style=""padding-top:20px;"">What kind of cable does the mic use and is it included?</h5><p>The included 10 foot cable has a 5-pin XLR female connector, which connects to the Sphere microphone, and a dual 3-pin XLR on the other side, which connects to your preamp. Equivalent cables are available from various other manufacturers.</p><h5 style=""padding-top:20px;"">I want to record in stereo. How can I do that using a Sphere microphone?</h5><p>With two Sphere microphones you can record stereo using any standard miking technique, such as ORTF, XY, or spaced pair, just as you would with two conventional microphones. But it is also possible record a 180 degree coincident stereo arrangement from a single Sphere microphone. You can even have the front of the microphone have one model and the rear have a different mic model.</p><p>For more information see the Stereo Recording chapter in the Sphere Hardware and Software Guide, which can be found in the “Doc” tab.</p><h5 style=""padding-top:20px;"">Do you plan on modeling additional microphones?</h5><p>Definitely. Some are already under development.</p><h5 style=""padding-top:20px;"">Will there be charges for plug-in updates, such as for additional mic models?</h5><p>We have no plans to charge for software updates for the bundled Sphere plug-in, but we are considering releasing other plug-ins as separate products.</p><h5 style=""padding-top:20px;"">I already have a great microphone collection. Why should I buy Sphere?</h5><ol>
<li>Even the best mic collection has its limits. What if you want multiple U47s or U67s for different sources? Unless you are Ocean Way, most studios are lucky to have one U47 or U67.</li>
<li>Vintage mics of the same type can sound very different depending on age, condition, and original production. For example, there are a number of distinctly different sounding flavors of U47s, such as those with an M7 capsule, an original K47 capsule and a later production K47 capsule with plastic diaphragm mounting ring. With Sphere you can have them all.</li>
<li>Auditioning and switching between mics can be tedious, and might tire a vocalist.</li>
<li>Don’t risk trashing your vintage U47 by putting it on a guitar amp or kick drum</li>
<li>Don’t risk blowing out a ribbon mic with a plosive or a loud source</li>
<li>Adjust the polar pattern and mic type while tracking and after recording!</li>
<li>You can actually adjust the amount of proximity effect of the microphone</li>
<li>With Off-Axis Correction™ you can greatly reduce bleed from other instruments</li>
<li>Use the mic in adverse acoustic environments, such as a hotel room. With Off-Axis Correction you can reduce the influence of poor acoustics.</li>
<li>Take it with you on the road, leaving your irreplaceable vintage mics at home.</li>
<li>When paired with an Apollo or Apollo Twin you have access to a complete world-class vocal or instrument signal chain at your fingertips, all with ultra-low latency processing.</li>
<li>Has a substantially lower noise floor than virtually any vintage microphone, and most modern ones as well.</li>
<li>Requires far less time and money for microphone maintenance (VF-14 tubes are expensive if you can find one)</li>

Manufactured to extremely tight tolerances, the L22 ensures that modeling is consistent and accurate.Realtime UAD ProcessingWith Universal Audio Apollo, achieve extremely low latency (approx. 1.6 ms round trip at 96 kHz) for guaranteed real-time performance. Also supports native AAX, VST and AU.Polar Pattern ModelingBecause Sphere captures the three-dimensional response of target microphones, it precisely emulates the polar patterns and other off-axis characteristics of vintage microphones which are essential to their unique sound. 

Re-Mic Sphere Tracks
Select mic type, polar pattern and other settings both before and after tracking. 

 

Adjustable Proximity Effect
No need to move a microphone solely because of too little or too much bass due to proximity effect. Great for punching in a vocal where distance from the mic varies from take to take.

Dual Mic ModelsDual Mode in the Sphere plug-in makes possible phase-coherent mixing of multiple virtual mic models from the same physical microphone, before or after tracking. It's also possible to adjust the relative phase alignment of the two mics with the Align control.Record In Stereo (With One Mic)With just one Sphere L22 mic it’s possible to make coincident stereo recordings, and even have different mic models on the left and right channels, using the Sphere 180 plug-in.Axis ShiftVirtually rotate the axis of the mic to give a more off-axis sound before or after tracking.Off-Axis Correction™Create more accurate polar patterns to reduce bleed and room coloration before, or after, tracking. For more information see the Off-Axis Correction chapter in the Sphere Hardware and Software User Guide.Polar MeterThe Sphere plug-in features a visually informative (and very cool) Polar Meter that dynamically displays the direction and level of sound being picked up by the microphone, as well as the currently selected polar pattern.Low NoiseThe microphone hardware has a self-noise level of 7dB-A SPL, well below most vintage microphones and comparable to many of the best modern microphones.High SPL HandlingThe L22 can handle in excess of 140dB SPL before clipping and is remarkably rugged. It won’t be damaged by high SPLs or air blasts as some vintage microphones can be.Using a dual-capsule microphone with dual-outputs makes it possible to more completely capture the soundfield—including the directional and distance information otherwise lost with a conventional single-channel microphone. This allows the Sphere system to precisely reconstruct how different microphones respond to the soundfield.In contrast, other microphone modeling technologies apply EQ to filter the sound from what is essentially a conventional microphone. This is fundamentally no different from using EQ to process a recorded track.The Sphere L22 microphone modeling system comprises this precision dual-channel microphone, plus an audio plug-in for your DAW. The software plug-in does all of the DSP processing used to create the microphone models. Using a plug-in, instead of DSP processing built into the mic, has the major advantage of allowing the user to change all of the modeling settings, such as mic type and polar pattern, after the audio is recorded.For more information about the technology behind Sphere take a look at the Sphere™ Technology Whitepaper.(NOTE: Hi-res audio files can be downloaded by clicking on the ""down arrow"" in the Soundcloud player.)Audio Comparisons with Vintage MicsWe have also created Sphere L22 A/B comparison tests, which directly compare the Sphere microphone models and the original microphones the models are based on. Each set of audio files comes in an ""A"" version and a ""B"" version, where the model and the original are randomly assigned to A or B, so that the test is blind.Head over to our website to find out more and to download the files.Precision Microphone

<p>Totally original in its design, Ark is a two-piece speaker system that combines a detachable mini Sound Bar and a powerful ported subwoofer Bass Station. Ark’s clever dual speaker design works seamlessly together to bring a new dimension to your music, movies and gaming. </p>
<p>Regular portable speakers have average sound power, but poor bass, and regular home speaker systems have good sound power, but are not portable. Ark is your perfect balance of portability and power. The dual parts can be connected into a single speaker unit that uses our Magnatec wireless charging technology, or positioned separately while still working in unison. You can even add any number of additional subwoofer Bass Stations to your Ark speaker system to bring unmatched customized levels of sound quality across a single room or your entire home.</p>

<p>We are coming to Kickstarter because we want to build a trusted and sustainable backer community of early adopters who appreciate real product innovation. Our vision is to continue the journey we have started of becoming a global player within the home and portable audio market.</p>
<p>Kickstarter community, we see you as playing a significant role in our vision and future, your commitment and feedback will help us reach our goal and beyond... With your help we can put our revolutionary, tried and tested, Cowin Ark speaker into mass production.</p>
<p>So if you are ready to experience a speaker revolution, please support our campaign. It could be a little, or it could be a lot, but every supporter takes us one step closer to our goal, and one step closer to you having an Ark of your own.</p>
</div>
</div>","Totally original in its design, Ark is a two-piece speaker system that combines a detachable mini Sound Bar and a powerful ported subwoofer Bass Station. Ark’s clever dual speaker design works seamlessly together to bring a new dimension to your music, movies and gaming. 
Regular portable speakers have average sound power, but poor bass, and regular home speaker systems have good sound power, but are not portable. Ark is your perfect balance of portability and power. The dual parts can be connected into a single speaker unit that uses our Magnatec wireless charging technology, or positioned separately while still working in unison. You can even add any number of additional subwoofer Bass Stations to your Ark speaker system to bring unmatched customized levels of sound quality across a single room or your entire home.















Ark is not just about flexibility; it was built to deliver superior sound. Two speaker drivers, passive radiators and a 3.5” ported subwoofer come together to deliver a new dimension to your audio and music.










Build out your Ark system with extra Bass Stations to bring unmatched, customized levels of sound quality across a single room, or your entire home. You can have an unlimited number of Bass Stations in the same room for ultimate sound intensity or you can have one in different rooms and take the Sound Bar with you to each room. Give some Bass to your Bluetooth!

Most importantly, Magnatec syncs the Bass Station and Sound Bar so they’re ready for playing your music and audio in super-rich sound across the full acoustic range.

<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>We’re TUNAI – a company founded with the belief to <strong>bring the best gadgets to consumers at an affordable price.</strong> Started by a group of friends with diverse backgrounds, from IC design to fashion, TUNAI solved the problem of finding the tech gadget you need at a price you can actually afford. Founded in 2014, we have delivered various supporter-backed projects to happy customers around the world.</p>
<p>After a successful launch of our TUNAI DRUM, the High-Resolution Bass Enhanced Audiophile Earphones crowdfunded on Kickstarter (we <strong>reached 100% of the funding goal in just 3 days and have more than 10,000 happy customers</strong>), we decided to launch TUNAI PIANO to deliver a more balanced sound quality for classical and acoustic enthusiasts. We have worked hard with a team of audio experts in Taiwan and Europe and our factories based in Taiwan, which manufacture some of the best audio products in the world, to <strong>develop a special solution that incorporate the special ceramic drivers to deliver crystal-clear and lively sound quality at a reasonable price.</strong></p>

<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges:</h2>
<p>Like any hardware project, there are risks and challenges associated with manufacturing and supply chain logistics. </p>
<p>Our production manufacturers are all Taiwanese companies; some of our component suppliers have factories based in China. We specifically looked for suppliers based in Taiwan so that it’s easier for us to mitigate and react quickly to the issues that rise with manufacturing the products. However, as part of our components are sourced from China based factory, there are still risks with sourcing and overall quality control. Overall, both TUNAI and our manufacturing partners have successfully managed the production and logistic issues so far with our other products in the past, so we believe we will be able to deliver PIANO to you on time.</p>

What people are saying about TUNAI PIANO:

*In the interview, we compare TUNAI PIAO (Retailed at $59.99) with British audio brand RHA model T10i (with more than 100 reviews and 4 stars rating on Amazon & 8/10 rating at CNET; retailed at $199.95)*

 

Experience clean, unadulterated sound with our top-class ceramic driver:
TUNAI PIANO is built just like high-end earphones, only without the $100+ price tag. TUNAI PIANO uses one dynamic driver plus one ceramic driver to create nicely layered presentation with excellent timbre.
Our ceramic driver, usually only featured in higher-end earphones, comes with excellent sound details, providing less distortion in extended high frequency and a natural tonality. TUNAI PIANO produces excellent clarity and airiness with sharp and focused notes, enabling you to capture every little detail in your playlist.

 
The 13mm dynamic driver is larger than the drivers featured in products within the similar price range. The result is clean, clear, detailed mid-range and refined instrumentals. The large dynamic driver is also able to produce a solid, but not overwhelming, bass with superb texture and punchiness. TUNAI PIANO offers a balanced and immersive sound experience that is comparable to high-end earphone that is priced between $100-$200. 

 

Improved Noise-Cancellation Performance
Continual testing and improvement allows us to achieve superior passive noise cancellation of up to 30dB (compare to normal earplug of 18dB). Listen to the clip below to hear the difference:

 

Bonus Feature for True-to-Life Audio Experience:
1. Comfort & Ergonomic design
Similar to our previous Drum earphone, TUNAI PIANO is available in four sizes of silky soft earbuds to ensure that every ear gets a snug fit. A great fit helps to ensure that outside noise won’t interrupt your music. Pop cover on and off easily for convenient washing - keep them (and your ears) clean!

We present to you...midiglue(midi + glue)A compact MIDI converter & MIDI effects unit.midiglue is a control box that can interconvert between MIDI, USB-MIDI, CV/GATE. It also acts as a MIDI effects unit, a sequencer, and an instrumental performance supporter. Plus, it also comes with a preset editor which can extend the pre-existing presets into your own desired MIDI effects. -----------------------------------------------------------------MIDI, USB-MIDI, CV/GATEの相互変換やルーティングが可能なコントロールボックスで、あらゆる電子楽器を有機的に連携させることができます。MIDIエフェクト・シーケンサ・演奏補助機能なども付属しており、ユーザーによる拡張のためのエディタも付属します。 Function #1 : Interconversion between different types of input/outputmidiglue supports USB MIDI host device, legacy MIDI, CV/GATE/SYNC, Footswitch. midiglue can convert signals between any combination of the above.In addition, you can also split, merge, route, and assign multiple parameter to a CC (Control Change).-----------------------------------------------------------------入出力タイプとして、USB MIDIのホスト・デバイスや、レガシーMIDI、CV/GATE/SYNC、Footswitchをサポート。これらすべての間での相互変換が可能です。加えて、スプリットやマージ、ルーティング、CCの複数パラメータへのアサイン等も行うこともできます。 Function #2 : Multi MIDI effects unitmidiglue is not just a MIDI converter. This hardware itself is a MIDI effector. From delay to pitch shifting, to sequencer and code assigner, many rich presets has been pre-installed for you.These effects can be switched like a multistomp. midiglue can be used for any kind of needs.-----------------------------------------------------------------midiglueには多彩なMIDIエフェクトが、プリセットとしてインストールされています。 ディレイやピッチシフト・コードアサイナーなど、受け取った入力に対してMIDIエフェクトを適用して出力したりするものや、 シーケンサやパターンジェネレータなど、入力がなくても単体でトリガーとして機能するものなど、多くのものを用意しています。これらのエフェクトは、マルチストンプのように切り替えることが可能です。 midiglueは、用途に応じて様々に動作を変化させることができるのです。
And... Fully-Programmable
You can create your own MIDI effects, or create some complicated routings. You can create these using a software editor that we have developed. The software editor is like a form of modular patching. midiglue will provide you with perfect functions, just for your live performances.-----------------------------------------------------------------必要に応じて、新しいMIDIエフェクトを作ったり、複雑なルーティングをすることができます。モジュラーのパッチングのような形式で、ソフトウェアエディターを用いて設定を行うことができます。 midiglueは、あなたのライブセットに完全にフィットしたコントロールを提供します。midiglue editorのモックアップ。記述されているプログラムは、冒頭の動画最後のデモ演奏で用いているエフェクトのものです。
Examples of connections using midiglueWe'll show you some examples of a connection settings using midiglue .If you wanted to create a setting like this, you would have had to purchase a converter that only offers a single function (Converting. Of course!) for an unreasonable price, or a laptop and an audio interface that would've taken up more space than a single gadget.With midiglue, you can adapt to any kind of situation with just a single device! -----------------------------------------------------------------midiglueを用いたライブセットの例を紹介します。今まではこのようなセットを構築するために、理不尽に高価で単一の機能しかないコンバーターを購入したり、ガジェットよりかさばるラップトップとオーディオインターフェースが必要だったかもしれません。midiglueを使えば、１台ですべてのケースに対応できます。 ?Example of converting USB MIDI to a legacy MIDI or CV/GATE

Incredibly powerful audio technology you’d normally find in a recording studio has been engineered to fit in your pocket, enabling you to do your best creative work wherever you are. Whether you’re a recording artist, or you just love great sounding audio, AudioWow puts studio-quality recording and playback in your pocket.   200K stretch goal is unlocked now. Buy AudioWow now, get an external microphone adapter along with the pack for free*! 
   If you’ve ever recorded a video or a song, you know that good audio is the most important part of any creative work. But to record a song, podcast video or vlog, you’re either stuck using big bulky studio equipment or using your AirPods or phone's mic, which just doesn’t sound good, let alone help you mix multiple audio signals. AudioWow replaces your traditional studio setup with a tiny device and a powerful app to enable you to do your best work wherever you are.   
 Just like an amazing podcast mic, or a mixing panel, AudioWow is a tool, and it’s up to you what you create with it. However, we think AudioWow is particularly useful to do these things:  If you’re a singer or musician you know inspiration comes at any time, with AudioWow you always have a recording studio with you. Whether you want to jam out and mix your guitar into your vocals, or record over an existing track, AudioWow lets you create studio-quality music wherever you are.  Record instrumentals and vocals on individual channels
   Your fancy podcast mic doesn’t always travel with you, so AudioWow lets you record and mix podcasts on location. Because it can mix background music with your voice, your podcast comes out ready to share without the need for any post-production. You can even connect two AudioWow’s to your phone to record your podcast on separate channels. 
   AudioWow connects with your smartphone or GoPro to record crystal clear audio for your content. Your Instagram stories, TikToks or field journalism will sound radically better because AudioWow has a crystal-clear microphone that is clipped closer to your mouth and clever algorithms enhance the sound quality as it records. 
  
 Calls, Zooms and admin are part of any creator’s life (unfortunately, we know), with AudioWow you’re never that person who “we can’t hear very well”. Connect AudioWow to your laptop during conf calls or use it to record and annotate calls, you can even read back the details of the conversation in text, if you need to look up any important details. Active noise reduction on the microphone means you can take calls even when you’re walking outside!  
 
 
 
  If you’re wondering how all this works, allow us to break it down for you. AudioWow is a modular system, you can connect two AudioWows to one phone, or combine it with other Bluetooth devices (more on that later) but let’s look at one AudioWow for now.     Just like a mixing panel, AudioWow has multiple inputs and outputs. You can record your voice via the built-in microphone, plug in headphones for an additional microphone and real-time monitoring. Inside the AudioWow the audio gets enhanced and leveled out before sending it over Bluetooth to your phone. Your phone in turn can send background music to the AudioWow to mix it in with your vocals and instrument. 
  AudioWow works out of the box with any Bluetooth device like your phone or laptop to give you endless recording options and combined with the app you’re unlocking some of the most powerful features.    If you’re like us, you know there’s nothing better to hone your craft than by singing your favorite songs by other artists. But it’s notoriously difficult to find the backing track of the latest music, so we’ve designed a unique feature: de-vocalization of any track! Just snap your fingers when you’re listening to music, and the AudioWow app filters out the original voice (sorry Lady Gaga) and lets you record your own vocals over the track. 
  The app gives you a full, 5 band visual equalizer to tune your audio to perfection. Digital effects let you add reverb, noise reduction, and gives you full control over all your settings. 
  The AudioWow app knows what you’re saying, it transcribes calls in real-time allowing you to save important conversations and it also saves the entire conversation on two separate channels, splitting your audio and that of the person you’re calling with, so you never miss a word. 
 
 One feature we’re particularly proud of is our advanced accessibility support for those with different hearing abilities. AudioWow lets you automatically add subtitles to your videos, which is a great way to make your content more accessible. We realized that more often than not creators don’t have an accessible version of their videos, because creating captions is a time-consuming process. That’s why we felt we could help creators everywhere improve the accessibility of their content by developing the auto-subtitle generator. Our guest-vlogger Peter put AudioWow to the test, comparing the audio quality of AudioWow to the sound of his iPhone while on a trip to a tropical location with lots of background noise.  
 
 
We also asked our friend Ricardo to use his guitar skills to record a demo where he uses AudioWow to record his voice and guitar which are both mixed and leveled out on the AudioWow. 

 


 

 


 One smartphone can connect to two AudioWows simultaneously to record individual audio tracks. It's the perfect option for podcasts, interviews, or if you want to keep separate instrumental and vocal tracks for post-production.  Last year we successfully funded our first project, SmartMike+ (check here for the campaign details), which is the perfect companion for AudioWow, especially during live streams.  Some apps don't support the high-quality audio standard over Bluetooth that AudioWow uses. That means that although you can use it with any app, to get the absolute best results on Snapchat, Instragram, TikTok and Twitch and other 3rd party apps, you can use the SmartMike+ as a receiver, which connects to your AudioWow over our proprietary Bluetooth protocol. You simply plug a SmartMike+ into your phone's 3.5mm jack and connect your audio to it wirelessly from AudioWow.If you're a frequent streamer or video creator, we've created a special Live-Streaming kit, which includes a SmartMike+ and a cable kit (3 Poles TRS cable for GoPro & DSLR x 1, 4 Poles TRRS cable for live streaming x 1).To use the Live-streaming kit is easy: 
  Press the button to start/stop the voice/phone-call/video recording. In the app, you can also customize the double-press for your frequently-used functions: De-vocal on/off, Play/pause the music, Flip the camera, or start/stop the phone call recording.    AudioWow uses the latest Qualcomm CSR Bluetooth Chipset and high-performance DSP. The built-in 6 mm condenser microphone's sensitivity is -36dB and the SNR(Signal to Noise Ratio) is 70dB, for delivering the high-quality sound for both video and audio recordings.  AudioWow also provides free OTA upgrade(Over-the-Air upgrade, no cables needed, upgrade the device through the in-app) so that users can get all the latest features from Sabinetek! 
 
  *TWS Pack includes 2 sets of AudioWow. One smartphone can connect to 2 AudioWow simultaneously. The sound from 2 AudioWow will be recorded in 2 separate soundtracks.

<h2>Pulse Analog Audio Components</h2>
<p>Digital audio, with all of it’s endless possibilities and advancements, falls short in a few key areas. First off, no matter how high your DAC’s sampling rate is, you’ll never be able to hear it ALL, as there’s simply not enough bandwidth or a high enough slew rate for high resolution audio playback.</p>
<p>Secondly, the grounding of a digital audio system is generally not centralized and/or well managed which contributes to the ever present issue of grounding loop noise. Thirdly, the impedance matching of the audio source and next stage doesn’t match well, resulting in the need to keep swapping out audiophile cables to compensate for the mismatch.</p>
<p>Our solutions for these complex problems are actually relatively simple. With the release of the following Pulse Analog components, we’re able to accomplish the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>Every Pulse Analog components featured here provides an ultra-high bandwidth with super fast slew rate resulting in your music being true to itself. Highs will be smooth, yet defined and not overbearing, while still allowing you to hear the difference between your high resolution music files in comparison to normal CD quality files.</li>
<li>With our currently available LPS4 and our soon to be released LPS8 super regulator controlled power supply, you’ll have a single device to supply power to your entire audio source system without the ground loop or reintroduced ground noise. Pulse LPS4 has been proven work so well that it received the “Greatest Bits Award” from AudioStream for its ability to pair not only with our Pulse DAC but a variety of other source gear as well. Go ahead, give the review a read.</li>
<li>From DAC (analog output) to Pulse Preamp, from Pulse Preamp to Pulse Power Amp. The output impedance and input impedance of next device is always incredibly well designed and perfectly matched by the LH Labs engineering team, making the whole system work in unison with sound perfection as the ultimate end-result.</li>
</ul>
<p>Without further ado, we’d like to introduce you to the complete Pulse Analog suite of components.</p>

<h2>Pulse Power Amplifier</h2>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441235749/zemkjrsl1yi9hvn1hazo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>Amplifiers have a very simple, but very important task. They take the audio signal from their input, amplify the signal by adding more ""juice,"" then pass it along to your loudspeakers. It sounds easy, but it's actually quite difficult to make amplified audio sound ""unamplified.""</p>
<p>With this in mind, we decided to attend to the amplification process, with a focus on a more efficient use of power. Ultimately, we developed three solutions that improve the sound quality, and ensure that everything can fit inside a very small footprint.</p>
<ul>
<li>Multi-Zone Class A (MCA): With our innovative MCA Amplification, Pulse Power Amplifier automatically adjusts to the most efficient amplification level to fit your listening volume.</li>
<li>Bipolar Instant Power (BIP): With BIP Boost technology, Pulse Power Amplifier holds power in reserve for sonic events that have more ""boom."" Pulse Power Amplifier’s bipolar power design will make the power output slew rate faster than ever. You need more bass power, you’ve got it, instantly.</li>
<li>Ultra-Wide Bandwidth: True to LH Labs' design philosophy, Pulse Power Amplifier has an extremely wide effective bandwidth.
Smart power management: With an automatic shut-off mode, Pulse Power Amplifier provides power when you need it and smart energy management when you don't.</li>

<h3>One Configuration To Rule Them All</h3>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Pulse Tube Headphone Amplifier is built with a hybrid solid state/tube topology with dual 6922/6DJ8 tubes in the voltage amplification stage, with a constant current source to make it more linear.</span><br/></p>

<h3>Circuit Topology</h3>
<p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441324009/pqtdxqrbtn7fgs6ueb6c.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Pulse Headphone Amp's voltage amplification stage works directly with its analog volume control circuit. By doing it this way, it won't attenuate your music in the first buffer stage of headphone amp like other devices (which decreases the SNR performance). It's the best variable gain design available, by maintaining the best noise floor and signal to noise ratio.</p>
<p>We know the importance of slew rate, which is defined as the rate at which voltage can change within the amp over time. Our current feedback structure is placed at the output, keeping Pulse Headphone Amp's slew rate above 2000V and preventing odd order distortion anomalies. Many of our competitor's slew rates clock in at only 20 to 100V.</p>
<p>To address the issue of power reserve, Pulse Headphone Amp's output stage keeps twice its rated power in reserve just in case you want the cannons in Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture to feel like they're taking aim right at you.</p><p></p><p></p><p><br/></p><p></p><h5>Amplifier Component Exchange (ACX)<br/><img border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://lhlabs.com/geekpulse3/images/h5_border-bottom.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
</h5><p>The Amplifier Component Exchange is a module that inserts into Pulse Headphone Amplifier that allows you to swap out its active components (transistors and OpAmps). Basically, it's tube rolling... except it's with active components instead of tubes. All you have to do is follow a simple procedure that we provide you with, and you can swap in your favorite active components anytime without affecting your warranty.</p><p>The core value of ACX is simple. A lot of audiophiles buy different amplifiers just because they want to find the best sound characteristics to fit with their headphones, or vice versa. Larry and Gavin do this all the time, too. Tube rollers do the same thing looking for audio nirvana. ACX enables you fine tune the sound without buying any NEW amplifiers. Too good to be true? No. No, it isn’t.</p><p>We feel very strongly about ACX, and have decided to add it to every HPA. It increases our cost, but it adds so much additional value, that we think it’s worth it. Don’t worry, this addition doesn't affect your price. Each HPA will come with a pair of ACX #1 modules installed by default, and you have option to get other ACX modules.</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Future Upgradeable</strong><br/>With ACX, your Pulse HPA is completely upgradeable. If you don't want to commit to additional modules now, you can do it later. The only risk is that the price for each module will be higher later.</li>
<li>
<strong>User Serviceable</strong><br/>ACX modules are easily swapped in and out. All you have to do is “Read the manual first”! And power down your Pulse HPA, pop the top, remove two screws, pull out one module, insert another, replace the two screws, stick the top back on, and power up.</li>
</ul><p>Remember, you’re not forced to buy only ONE. You can pick as many as you like. Have fun with it! You could even trade them with your Geek Force friends.</p><p>Please note: These ACX modules are <strong>not waterproof. You should not throw it into the fire. If you sit on it, it will break. Handle with care.</strong></p><p><strong>Five ACX-I Options</strong></p><ul>
<li>
<strong>ACX-I #1: Included</strong><br/><p>This input module comes standard in your Pulse HPA. In features quad JFET transistors plus dual OPA1652 OpAmps biased to pure Class A. This is the structure when we want to have the best bang for the bucks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>ACX-I #2: $89</strong><br/><p>This input module features quad transistors plus dual OPA2604 OpAmps biased to pure Class A. These are the same OpAmps that we use in our first prototype Geek Out. To our taste, they have a traditional “Burr-Brown” sound. They’re a little bit dark, and a little laid back. Classic!</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>ACX-I #3: $109</strong><br/><p>This input module features quad transistors plus quad AD797 OpAmps biased in pure Class A. These OpAmps are famous for their transparency and clarity. If you’re a “clinician” (like Gavin in happy mode), this module is for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>ACX-I #4: $129</strong><br/><p>This input module features ultra low noise quad transistors plus dual OPA1612 OpAmps biased in pure Class A. These are the same OpAmps we use in the IV stage of Pulse X Fi DAC. They’re very detailed, but still organic sounding. This combination is Larry’s personal favorite for classical music out of the five options we offer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>ACX-I #5: $169</strong><br/><p>This input module features ultra low noise quad transistors plus dual famous AD8620 OpAmps biased in pure Class A. Of all our options, these OpAmps are the most precise, the most technically perfect, high speed and low noise.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3><br/></h3><h3>The History of Pulse Headphone Amplifier</h3>
<p>Back in 2009, Larry was on a quest to promote the importance of high-resolution audio. He had been building the first 32 bit/384 kHz bit perfect resistor ladder DAC, and so he was traveling to speak who anyone who would listen, which included a visit to Intel, one of his first investors, and International CES in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>At the time, he was demonstrating his DAC using a headphone rig. He'd chose the HD800 over-ear headphones from Sennheiser as his reference, but he couldn't find a headphone amp with a wide enough bandwidth to reveal the beautiful nuances of 384 kHz digital music; nor could he find an amp with enough power to effortlessly drive his big cans. He needed a fully-balanced, dual-mono amp with a DC coupled, non-negative feedback output. And since he was demoing 384 kHz music, he needed a bandwidth of at least 200 kHz.</p>
<p>He couldn't find such a beast, so he built it himself.</p>
<p>The feedback he received from his demonstrations was remarkable. Interestingly enough, he found that even people who didn't self-identify as audiophiles were touched by the music they heard through his rig.</p>
<p>After this experience, he went to work and finished the development of Da Vinci DAC. The headphone amp, sadly, has only been enjoyed by a very few people since. Now six years after its first development, we're excited to offer you the improved version of his latest (but not first) headphone amplifier: Pulse Headphone Amplifier.</p>
<h3><br/></h3><h3>Power Supply</h3>
<p>Pulse Headphone Amplifier comes with an ultra low noise 12V DC switching power supply. However, we highly recommend that you use Pulse Tube HPA with our Pulse LPS4. Pulse Tube HPA requires 1.2A 12V, one 500mA 12V output from LPS4.</p>
<h3><br/></h3><h3>Pulse Headphone Amp FAQ's</h3>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> The Pulse HPA is not fully discrete but is it still op amp based? Wouldn’t that make it similar to the Pulse DAC headphone out except with a lot more power?</p>
<p>A: Pulse Tube HPA is an opamp/discrete + solid state/tube hybrid. ""More power"" is one difference, but there are at least three other major differences:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pulse HPA has THREE dedicated headphone output circuits, optimized for IEM's, standard headphone, and hard-to-drive cans. While Pulse DAC uses a gain switch (similar to other popular headphone amps), Pulse HPA uses separate, dedicated circuits.</li>
<li>Pulse HPA features an optimized analog volume control. If you use Pulse DAC is concert with your Pulse HPA, you have a combination of digital and analog volume controls. We'll publish an article on our blog about this soon.</li>
<li>Pulse HPA has no digital circuitry. It's pure analog!</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Has it been confirmed anywhere if a single LPS4 can look after both the Pulse and HPA? I assume it uses one of the 12v rails?</p>
<p>A: Yes. Please see the updated power supply area for a description.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Is it required to purchase separate tubes for Tube HPA?</p>
<p>A: Yes. We offer a pair of JJ E88CC/6922 Tubes here on the campaign for $49.</p>

Pulse Analog Audio Components
Digital audio, with all of it’s endless possibilities and advancements, falls short in a few key areas. First off, no matter how high your DAC’s sampling rate is, you’ll never be able to hear it ALL, as there’s simply not enough bandwidth or a high enough slew rate for high resolution audio playback.
Secondly, the grounding of a digital audio system is generally not centralized and/or well managed which contributes to the ever present issue of grounding loop noise. Thirdly, the impedance matching of the audio source and next stage doesn’t match well, resulting in the need to keep swapping out audiophile cables to compensate for the mismatch.
Our solutions for these complex problems are actually relatively simple. With the release of the following Pulse Analog components, we’re able to accomplish the following.

Every Pulse Analog components featured here provides an ultra-high bandwidth with super fast slew rate resulting in your music being true to itself. Highs will be smooth, yet defined and not overbearing, while still allowing you to hear the difference between your high resolution music files in comparison to normal CD quality files.
With our currently available LPS4 and our soon to be released LPS8 super regulator controlled power supply, you’ll have a single device to supply power to your entire audio source system without the ground loop or reintroduced ground noise. Pulse LPS4 has been proven work so well that it received the “Greatest Bits Award” from AudioStream for its ability to pair not only with our Pulse DAC but a variety of other source gear as well. Go ahead, give the review a read.
From DAC (analog output) to Pulse Preamp, from Pulse Preamp to Pulse Power Amp. The output impedance and input impedance of next device is always incredibly well designed and perfectly matched by the LH Labs engineering team, making the whole system work in unison with sound perfection as the ultimate end-result.

Without further ado, we’d like to introduce you to the complete Pulse Analog suite of components.


Pulse Power Amplifier
Amplifiers have a very simple, but very important task. They take the audio signal from their input, amplify the signal by adding more ""juice,"" then pass it along to your loudspeakers. It sounds easy, but it's actually quite difficult to make amplified audio sound ""unamplified.""
With this in mind, we decided to attend to the amplification process, with a focus on a more efficient use of power. Ultimately, we developed three solutions that improve the sound quality, and ensure that everything can fit inside a very small footprint.

Multi-Zone Class A (MCA): With our innovative MCA Amplification, Pulse Power Amplifier automatically adjusts to the most efficient amplification level to fit your listening volume.
Bipolar Instant Power (BIP): With BIP Boost technology, Pulse Power Amplifier holds power in reserve for sonic events that have more ""boom."" Pulse Power Amplifier’s bipolar power design will make the power output slew rate faster than ever. You need more bass power, you’ve got it, instantly.
Ultra-Wide Bandwidth: True to LH Labs' design philosophy, Pulse Power Amplifier has an extremely wide effective bandwidth.
Smart power management: With an automatic shut-off mode, Pulse Power Amplifier provides power when you need it and smart energy management when you don't.

Two Configurations

*Special note: Only one S100 is required for a stereo sound system.  However, if you choose to pre-order the M200 mono block's you'll need TWO of them to make stereo sound.  Pricing of the M200 is per amplifier.  


Pulse Tube Headphone Amplifier
You've gone and done it. You've spent a good amount of money on a set of headphones. You've spent time with them and you think they sound superb. But can they do better? Enter our solution to your question, Pulse Headphone Amplifier. 
One Configuration To Rule Them All
Pulse Tube Headphone Amplifier is built with a hybrid solid state/tube topology with dual 6922/6DJ8 tubes in the voltage amplification stage, with a constant current source to make it more linear.


Circuit Topology
Pulse Headphone Amp's voltage amplification stage works directly with its analog volume control circuit. By doing it this way, it won't attenuate your music in the first buffer stage of headphone amp like other devices (which decreases the SNR performance). It's the best variable gain design available, by maintaining the best noise floor and signal to noise ratio.
We know the importance of slew rate, which is defined as the rate at which voltage can change within the amp over time. Our current feedback structure is placed at the output, keeping Pulse Headphone Amp's slew rate above 2000V and preventing odd order distortion anomalies. Many of our competitor's slew rates clock in at only 20 to 100V.
To address the issue of power reserve, Pulse Headphone Amp's output stage keeps twice its rated power in reserve just in case you want the cannons in Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture to feel like they're taking aim right at you.Amplifier Component Exchange (ACX)
The Amplifier Component Exchange is a module that inserts into Pulse Headphone Amplifier that allows you to swap out its active components (transistors and OpAmps). Basically, it's tube rolling... except it's with active components instead of tubes. All you have to do is follow a simple procedure that we provide you with, and you can swap in your favorite active components anytime without affecting your warranty.The core value of ACX is simple. A lot of audiophiles buy different amplifiers just because they want to find the best sound characteristics to fit with their headphones, or vice versa. Larry and Gavin do this all the time, too. Tube rollers do the same thing looking for audio nirvana. ACX enables you fine tune the sound without buying any NEW amplifiers. Too good to be true? No. No, it isn’t.We feel very strongly about ACX, and have decided to add it to every HPA. It increases our cost, but it adds so much additional value, that we think it’s worth it. Don’t worry, this addition doesn't affect your price. Each HPA will come with a pair of ACX #1 modules installed by default, and you have option to get other ACX modules.

Future UpgradeableWith ACX, your Pulse HPA is completely upgradeable. If you don't want to commit to additional modules now, you can do it later. The only risk is that the price for each module will be higher later.

User ServiceableACX modules are easily swapped in and out. All you have to do is “Read the manual first”! And power down your Pulse HPA, pop the top, remove two screws, pull out one module, insert another, replace the two screws, stick the top back on, and power up.
Remember, you’re not forced to buy only ONE. You can pick as many as you like. Have fun with it! You could even trade them with your Geek Force friends.Please note: These ACX modules are not waterproof. You should not throw it into the fire. If you sit on it, it will break. Handle with care.Five ACX-I Options

The History of Pulse Headphone Amplifier
Back in 2009, Larry was on a quest to promote the importance of high-resolution audio. He had been building the first 32 bit/384 kHz bit perfect resistor ladder DAC, and so he was traveling to speak who anyone who would listen, which included a visit to Intel, one of his first investors, and International CES in Las Vegas.
At the time, he was demonstrating his DAC using a headphone rig. He'd chose the HD800 over-ear headphones from Sennheiser as his reference, but he couldn't find a headphone amp with a wide enough bandwidth to reveal the beautiful nuances of 384 kHz digital music; nor could he find an amp with enough power to effortlessly drive his big cans. He needed a fully-balanced, dual-mono amp with a DC coupled, non-negative feedback output. And since he was demoing 384 kHz music, he needed a bandwidth of at least 200 kHz.
He couldn't find such a beast, so he built it himself.
The feedback he received from his demonstrations was remarkable. Interestingly enough, he found that even people who didn't self-identify as audiophiles were touched by the music they heard through his rig.
After this experience, he went to work and finished the development of Da Vinci DAC. The headphone amp, sadly, has only been enjoyed by a very few people since. Now six years after its first development, we're excited to offer you the improved version of his latest (but not first) headphone amplifier: Pulse Headphone Amplifier.
Power Supply
Pulse Headphone Amplifier comes with an ultra low noise 12V DC switching power supply. However, we highly recommend that you use Pulse Tube HPA with our Pulse LPS4. Pulse Tube HPA requires 1.2A 12V, one 500mA 12V output from LPS4.
Pulse Headphone Amp FAQ's
Q: The Pulse HPA is not fully discrete but is it still op amp based? Wouldn’t that make it similar to the Pulse DAC headphone out except with a lot more power?
A: Pulse Tube HPA is an opamp/discrete + solid state/tube hybrid. ""More power"" is one difference, but there are at least three other major differences:

Pulse HPA has THREE dedicated headphone output circuits, optimized for IEM's, standard headphone, and hard-to-drive cans. While Pulse DAC uses a gain switch (similar to other popular headphone amps), Pulse HPA uses separate, dedicated circuits.
Pulse HPA features an optimized analog volume control. If you use Pulse DAC is concert with your Pulse HPA, you have a combination of digital and analog volume controls. We'll publish an article on our blog about this soon.
Pulse HPA has no digital circuitry. It's pure analog!

Q: Has it been confirmed anywhere if a single LPS4 can look after both the Pulse and HPA? I assume it uses one of the 12v rails?
A: Yes. Please see the updated power supply area for a description.
Q: Is it required to purchase separate tubes for Tube HPA?
A: Yes. We offer a pair of JJ E88CC/6922 Tubes here on the campaign for $49.

Hello we are from Amplify and we live in a small town in Croatia called Zadar.
My idea started when I began seeing how stagnate portable music industry is. That's when I decided to reimagine the core function of bluetooth speakers.
With our device you will be able to get big sound in a small package.

Specification
Audio input:

Bluetooth v4.Stereo input various versions of the Bluetooth connection
Aux input 

Output impedance:

8ω(best), 4/6/8/16ω impedance can drive speakers 
Output power: add pre-5532 output foot
powered 25V
6ω impedance output 2x50w 
8ω impedance output 2x40w dual-channel  

What it is & how it works
It is a portable amplifier that can potentially make any speaker portable. You just plug in your speaker and you are good to go.
How it works:

Do you know that big thing that sits under your desk? It's called an amp and we figured out a way to make it smaller...a lot smaller, while keeping it's power! Our product has an integrated battery so you can take it places you never imagined you would bring your amp to. It uses new technology that eliminates the need for a big amp. It takes the best of both worlds: The power and the quality of a home speaker and the portability of a bluetooth speaker but instead of costing 200$, like regular bluetooth speakers, you only pay 80$ for a much greater experience.

<p><strong>You'll be asked for your favourite tube when commissioning your order.</strong></p>
<h3>Oh, what are ""Nixie tubes"" ?</h3>
<p>The word ""Nixie"" was formed from the words Numeric Indicator eXerimental No. 1  and first introduced 1954 by Burroughs Corporation from USA as a brand name for numeric displays. Nixie tubes were used until the mid of the 1970's as displays in measuring devices, calculators, TV sets and the very first computers. The evolution of modern style display types like Numitron, VFD, LED and LCD, which have a very low supply voltage (battery power supply) eliminated these Nixie tubes from the market, and they are not produced anymore. In the former USSR Nixie tubes were produced as surplus in vast quantities until the beginning of the 90's –  and from this sources are these tubes.  But even these supplies are soon running short. And when they're gone, they're gone. The tubes are taken from ""NOS"", what means New Old Stock. They were never used before and spent their first thirty or more years forgotten in some warehouse. The principle of the Nixie tubes is based on a ""cold cathode discharge"" and it is used today a million times e.g. in small neon bulbs of illuminated mains power switches.</p>

<p>The IN-9 Bargraph tubes in the IN-9 Nixielyzer are a specialized construction of such a neon bulb, it can produce a current depending variable glow hight lenght when a current regulated voltage of around 140 V is applied, and it was used in the USSR for example as a simple device to monitor the mains voltage range.<br/> </p>

Very long lifespan of the Nixie tubes (10++ years)

 
Argon or Neon filled tubes ? 

You'll be asked for your favourite tube when commissioning your order.
Oh, what are ""Nixie tubes"" ?
The word ""Nixie"" was formed from the words Numeric Indicator eXerimental No. 1  and first introduced 1954 by Burroughs Corporation from USA as a brand name for numeric displays. Nixie tubes were used until the mid of the 1970's as displays in measuring devices, calculators, TV sets and the very first computers. The evolution of modern style display types like Numitron, VFD, LED and LCD, which have a very low supply voltage (battery power supply) eliminated these Nixie tubes from the market, and they are not produced anymore. In the former USSR Nixie tubes were produced as surplus in vast quantities until the beginning of the 90's –  and from this sources are these tubes.  But even these supplies are soon running short. And when they're gone, they're gone. The tubes are taken from ""NOS"", what means New Old Stock. They were never used before and spent their first thirty or more years forgotten in some warehouse. The principle of the Nixie tubes is based on a ""cold cathode discharge"" and it is used today a million times e.g. in small neon bulbs of illuminated mains power switches.

A simple russian IN-9 mains voltage meter, found on Ebay
The IN-9 Bargraph tubes in the IN-9 Nixielyzer are a specialized construction of such a neon bulb, it can produce a current depending variable glow hight lenght when a current regulated voltage of around 140 V is applied, and it was used in the USSR for example as a simple device to monitor the mains voltage range.

<p>Plugfones were initially dreamed up after Shaun, our co-founder, found himself too preoccupied with his own thoughts while working tirelessly in a glass factory. After searching in futility for a set of earplugs that would also play music, he began scraping together funds to assemble prototypes in his garage. By testing them himself and on colleagues, he made the requisite changes to produce a product that perfectly straddled the line between earplug and earphone.</p>

<p>Conventional earbuds, even those designed to cancel noise and costing hundreds of dollars, aren’t comfortable for all-day use. Plugfones were engineered as earplugs first, which means that your ears won’t fatigue after wearing these on a 12 hour shift or while shooting your AR-15.</p>
<p>Even if you aren’t working in the field or in a factory, having a set of earplugs makes everyday scenarios far more tolerable: riding the subway, sleeping alongside a snoring partner, maintaining focus in the gym, mowing the lawn, or keeping outside distractions at bay while gaming. Or, for the crazy ones, <b><i>skydiving</i></b>!</p>
<p></p>
<p>The issue, of course, is that typical earplugs are boring. <i>Really</i> boring. Plugfones Liberate enables you to enjoy the spoils of an earplug without going insane. While your ears are being protected, you’ll be treated to top-notch aural excitement. Beyond streaming music, you’ll also be able to take incoming calls without having to expose your ears to unsafe levels of loudness even for a moment.</p>

<h1>Certification process</h1>
<p>The Liberate, just like our <a href=""https://www.plugfones.com/product/contractor/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">existing wired Plugfones</a>, have been tested by a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory (NRTL). A third-party firm, Michael &amp; Associates, Inc., was employed to rigorously test our products according to U.S., E.U., and Australian standards. Our new Liberate headset received an ANSI certified NRR (<a href=""https://www.osha.gov/dts/osta/otm/noise/hcp/attenuation_estimation.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Noise Reduction Rating</a>) of 26.</p>

Liberate works to reduce your ear’s exposure to loudness, enabling you to enjoy music at lower volumes while protecting one of the most important senses you have: the ability to hear.</p>

<p>Because Liberate is designed to be worn for extended periods of time, we’ve designed the earplug tips to be user-replaceable. We recommend silicon tips be swapped out every four weeks, and foam tips every one to two weeks. We toss in four total sets of tips (two silicon and two foam sets) with each Liberate. Replacement sets in quantities of ten are available on our website for $7.99.</p>

<p>Seating a Plugfone in one’s ear canal is fundamentally different than seating a conventional earbud. If you’re an avid earbud wearer, remember to seat the Plugfone Liberate more deeply than you normally would -- it’s an earplug, after all! </p>

<p>We generally recommend to seat the Liberate without music already playing. Once you seal out external noise, then turn on your music. If you can hear the low-end resonate, you’ve successfully seated your Liberate!</p>
<h1>Design</h1>
<p>Designing a product like the Liberate requires months of planning, tooling, re-tooling, and if we're honest, another round of re-tooling. We're big fans of exploring prototypes and getting behind the scenes tours of our favorite gadgets, so we wanted to share a few initial drafts, drawings, and renditions that we generated en route to a finalized product.</p>

</div></div>","Introducing Plugfones LiberatePatent PendingNoise-isolating earbuds are far from novel, but the Plugfones Liberate flips a common equation on its proverbial ear: we’ve engineered a product that’s earplug first, earbud second. Building on what we’ve learned for the past 6 years producing WIRED Plugfones, we’ve SEVERED the cable with Plugfones Liberate.These Bluetooth 4.0 earplugs offer the same top-notch aural quality as our wired Plugfones, but without the hassle of a 3.5mm connector.Plugfones LiberateAt The GymEach Liberate headset has a Bluetooth 4.0 antenna, a fully sweatproof design, a noise-reducing inline microphone for voice calls, ruggedized play/pause, volume up, and volume down buttons, song progression buttons, and a water resistant USB charging connector. You can expect the battery to last 8 hours on a full charge, enabling you to easily get through extended shifts without having to source power.While Traveling

Our roots

On The Jobsite
Plugfones were initially dreamed up after Shaun, our co-founder, found himself too preoccupied with his own thoughts while working tirelessly in a glass factory. After searching in futility for a set of earplugs that would also play music, he began scraping together funds to assemble prototypes in his garage. By testing them himself and on colleagues, he made the requisite changes to produce a product that perfectly straddled the line between earplug and earphone.

Plugfones Liberate
We’ve been doing this for nearly six years, and count the likes of Goodyear, La-Z-Boy Manufacturing, and Tyson Foods as customers.
Changing the mold

Preliminary Designs
Conventional earbuds, even those designed to cancel noise and costing hundreds of dollars, aren’t comfortable for all-day use. Plugfones were engineered as earplugs first, which means that your ears won’t fatigue after wearing these on a 12 hour shift or while shooting your AR-15.
Even if you aren’t working in the field or in a factory, having a set of earplugs makes everyday scenarios far more tolerable: riding the subway, sleeping alongside a snoring partner, maintaining focus in the gym, mowing the lawn, or keeping outside distractions at bay while gaming. Or, for the crazy ones, skydiving!

The issue, of course, is that typical earplugs are boring. Really boring. Plugfones Liberate enables you to enjoy the spoils of an earplug without going insane. While your ears are being protected, you’ll be treated to top-notch aural excitement. Beyond streaming music, you’ll also be able to take incoming calls without having to expose your ears to unsafe levels of loudness even for a moment.


Certification process
The Liberate, just like our existing wired Plugfones, have been tested by a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory (NRTL). A third-party firm, Michael & Associates, Inc., was employed to rigorously test our products according to U.S., E.U., and Australian standards. Our new Liberate headset received an ANSI certified NRR (Noise Reduction Rating) of 26.


As you’d expect, we’re big advocates of protecting your hearing. It’s an element of our lives that we often take for granted, and it’s difficult to recognize small but meaningful diminishment to how acutely we’re able to hear. 

While Landscaping
If you commute daily on a subway, are exposed to loud machinery, or routinely find yourself in noisy environments, it’s not enough to simply drown out the external world with loud music. Liberate works to reduce your ear’s exposure to loudness, enabling you to enjoy music at lower volumes while protecting one of the most important senses you have: the ability to hear.

At The Shooting Range
Plugfones in the Media
""I was able to head out onto the busy CES show floor and hear nothing except for the sweet sounds of U2."" - Reviewed
“I could have used a pair of these when I lived in the Lower East Side of Manhattan and drunken NYU students were screaming at each other at 3 in the morning.” -David Goldman, CNN Money

David Goldman, CNN Money
Technically Speaking

In-Flight
Because Liberate is designed to be worn for extended periods of time, we’ve designed the earplug tips to be user-replaceable. We recommend silicon tips be swapped out every four weeks, and foam tips every one to two weeks. We toss in four total sets of tips (two silicon and two foam sets) with each Liberate. Replacement sets in quantities of ten are available on our website for $7.99.

Foam and Silicone Replacement Plugs
Seating a Plugfone in one’s ear canal is fundamentally different than seating a conventional earbud. If you’re an avid earbud wearer, remember to seat the Plugfone Liberate more deeply than you normally would -- it’s an earplug, after all! 

At The Gym
We generally recommend to seat the Liberate without music already playing. Once you seal out external noise, then turn on your music. If you can hear the low-end resonate, you’ve successfully seated your Liberate!
Design
Designing a product like the Liberate requires months of planning, tooling, re-tooling, and if we're honest, another round of re-tooling. We're big fans of exploring prototypes and getting behind the scenes tours of our favorite gadgets, so we wanted to share a few initial drafts, drawings, and renditions that we generated en route to a finalized product.

It is too good to be true. What discounts can be expected after the Super Early Bird?</strong></p><p>First of all, please trust the quality of PaMu. Our team, Padmate, has worked in the audio industry for more than 17 years! We develop and fabricate for major brands including Monster, Intel, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Padmate has top tier engineers to develop these innovative audio products for you! We also own the best factories in the audio industry all over the world! We have done a lot of OEM and ODM programs, but now we want to go directly to our customers because we have the dream of developing the best audio devices for all of our customers.  This is why we can and want to offer an amazingly low price for our early bird perks.  We cannot cover the cost at this low price, but it will be super good to do our branding and benefit our first batch fans. Of course, these discounts are so big that we can only offer limited quantities at this price. Once the cost reaches the budget, the early bird discount will be gone. The Super Early Bird perk is the best discount you will get – back the PaMu now before it sells out!</p><p><strong>2) When is the expected delivery?</strong></p><p>We planed to start shipping in March, however, Pamu is much more popular than we expected. We are already in the process of production, and the expected shipping time will be in<strong> early April</strong>. We will ship in batches.</p><p><strong>3）What’s the IP rating of these earphones? Can I take a shower with your earbuds?</strong></p><p>By using a water-repellent sealing design, we keep the inside dry and fully functional. These earbuds aren’t afraid of sweat or rain or a shower. Here is the PaMu water proof testing video</p><div>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/YNOjdikJy34?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>Test conditions: Water flow rate 10L/minutes, last for 30 minutes. The distance between PaMu earphones and stream nozzle is 0.5 meter. Normal IP 5 condition is 5 minutes, we tested it for 30 minutes, they works well. So, you can definitely wear PaMu to take a shower.</p>
<p>PaMu earphones are more than IP 5, but our team usually make conservative statements. PaMu will definitely bring a lot of more surprises to you!!!</p>
</div><p><strong>4) Are there plans for more colors to be offered?</strong></p><p>We plan to designing more colors for our PaMu fans to choose from in our future products. Now we have only two colors available.</p><p><strong>5) What version Bluetooth does PaMu use?</strong></p><p>PaMu uses Bluetooth 4.2 because there are far less devices that can connect to Bluetooth 5.0. We are considering Bluetooth 5.0 in our next product.</p><p><strong>6) What is the warranty policy if I receive a defective set?</strong></p><p>We value our users, and we blieve in our products. If there is a problem due to manufacturer's defect, we will replace your PaMu.</p><p><strong>7) How do I get my Order ID?</strong></p><p>You can find your Order ID by logging into your Indiegogo account and clicking on ‘My Contribution’.</p><p><strong>8) Why does it take 2 hours to charge the battery case？</strong></p><p>Two hours is the maximum charging time with lower current chargers, such as charging from your PC's USB port.  Most of the time, you will need less than 2 hours to get both the earbuds and the charging case fully charged.</p><p><strong>9) What type of antenna do you use?</strong></p><p>We use LDS, and we chose the only mobile device that uses typical vmlinux. Although the cost of the LDS antenna is higher, it is of better quality, performance, and stability for the Bluetooth connection.</p><p><strong>10) Can you hear calls through both earpieces, and can one be used at a time while the other can charge?</strong></p><p>When you answer a phone call, only one earbud will hear the phone. The two earbuds can be used separately only when each earbud is far away from each other.  If the two earbuds are within range of each other, they will automatically pair.</p><p><strong>11) How can I change the color from white to black？</strong></p><p>Indiegogo does not allow you to change the selected color - please email us with your Order ID and colour choice and we will update the color for your order.</p><p><strong>12）What’s the IP rating of these earphones? Can I go swimming with your earbuds?</strong></p><p>By using a water-repellent design, we're able to keep the inside dry and fully functional. Pamu is IP 5. These earbuds aren’t afraid of sweat or rain! But it can’t be submerged in water for a long time.  So, this means it can’t be used during swimming.  We will design a new generation of earbuds that can be worn while swimming in the future.</p><p><strong>13）What’s the PaMu’s advantage of bass effect compared to other earphones？</strong></p><p>Our 10mm dynamic audio driver is Biodiaphram cell. It is designed to deliver sound of balanced deep low bass without saricficing the mids and the highs. So PaMu has a special technique for bass effect.</p><p><strong>14）How does the noisy cancellation work? Is there a switch?</strong></p><p>Our NC means Passive noise reduction, not Active NC.Our earplugs are patented in-ear design, not only can block noise but also comfortable.</p><p><strong>15) Does PaMu can  reach the decode  level of APTX?</strong></p><p>Our earphones can reach the decoding level of SBC and AAC. At present, the rf signal of the APTX decoding scheme in the market is not stable now, so we need to balance the stability of rf signal and the clear effect of audio decoding. PaMu will give fans a great sound experience.</p><p><strong>16) Bluetooth 4.2 TWS earbuds usually have dropout issues when there are a lot of interference (other 2.4Ghz devices broadcasting/sending/receiving). How will you avoid this issue with BT 4.2 used to communicate between the 2 earbuds? </strong></p><p>2.4GHz is vulnerable to be interfered in an environment of intense human interference, and our RF engineers are aware of this and have tested it accordingly. After a lot of actual testing and improvement .Now compared with SONY\ APPLE and other brand headphones, PADMATE in the TWS peer RF interference ability is among the leading.</p><p><strong>17) Does it have charging cables and other appendix?</strong></p><p>This item included one pair PaMu earbuds with a charging case and one charging cable, an instructions book and 3 pair ear-tips of S, M, L size.Thanks!</p><p><strong>18) Does your  products have sound delay?</strong></p><p>We use the latest technology and pass multiple tests to solve the problem of bluetooth connection delay. In normal useing, there will be almost no bluetooth delay or broken line.</p></div>","What? Why no black AirPods, you say?

Pamu is IP 5. These earbuds aren’t afraid of sweat or rain! But it can’t be submerged in water for a long time.  So, this means it can’t be used during swimming.  We will design a new generation of earbuds that can be worn while swimming in the future.13）What’s the PaMu’s advantage of bass effect compared to other earphones？Our 10mm dynamic audio driver is Biodiaphram cell. It is designed to deliver sound of balanced deep low bass without saricficing the mids and the highs. So PaMu has a special technique for bass effect.14）How does the noisy cancellation work? Is there a switch?Our NC means Passive noise reduction, not Active NC.Our earplugs are patented in-ear design, not only can block noise but also comfortable.15) Does PaMu can  reach the decode  level of APTX?Our earphones can reach the decoding level of SBC and AAC. At present, the rf signal of the APTX decoding scheme in the market is not stable now, so we need to balance the stability of rf signal and the clear effect of audio decoding. PaMu will give fans a great sound experience.16) Bluetooth 4.2 TWS earbuds usually have dropout issues when there are a lot of interference (other 2.4Ghz devices broadcasting/sending/receiving). How will you avoid this issue with BT 4.2 used to communicate between the 2 earbuds? 2.4GHz is vulnerable to be interfered in an environment of intense human interference, and our RF engineers are aware of this and have tested it accordingly. After a lot of actual testing and improvement .Now compared with SONY\ APPLE and other brand headphones, PADMATE in the TWS peer RF interference ability is among the leading.17) Does it have charging cables and other appendix?This item included one pair PaMu earbuds with a charging case and one charging cable, an instructions book and 3 pair ear-tips of S, M, L size.Thanks!18) Does your  products have sound delay?We use the latest technology and pass multiple tests to solve the problem of bluetooth connection delay. In normal useing, there will be almost no bluetooth delay or broken line.",27.0,1,"4 Campaigns
