This October, alongside Jersey City's Art House Productions, we'll be producing Alexander Janosek Doyle's new play, <i>Is That Danny DeVito?</i>, an absurd comedy parodying <i>Waiting for Godot</i>. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Written in the style of the absurdist comedies of

for a perpetually delayed bus to return them from their New England campsite to
their beloved Garden State.</p>
<p>As they wait, Dusty (Julian Gordon) and Geoff (David
Gazzo) pass the time with the help of bizarre locals (Natasha Edwards &amp;
Carlo Fiorletta) and conversations on topics ranging from the millennial experience to celebrity culture, pop
entertainment, literature, New Jersey, and whether or not a man unseen to the
audience is Danny DeVito.</p>

</div><div>Founded by acclaimed director, actor and overall geek Daniel Wood, The Rogues Gallery is a theater company dedicated to producing plays with geek themes. The spark of the idea for this theater company was born at <a href=""http://prime.paxsite.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">PAX Prime</a> 2010, in front of an audience of 550 geeks during a standing ovation for the world premier of Cameron McNary's play ""Of Dice and Men"", about a group of 30-something Dungeons &amp; Dragons players. It was a monumental experience which <a href=""http://www.penny-arcade.com/news/post/2010/9/10"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">famously made Tycho's mom cry</a>. </div><div>Now Daniel and Cameron are teaming up once again to bring you his newest brilliant incarnation, ""Shoggoths on the Veldt.""</div><div><br/></div><div>
<span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">What's This All About Then? </span>
</div><div>
<p>Putting on a professional play is expensive. Putting on a professional play that includes the kind of special effects necessary for a good CTHULHU story even more so. The $5,000 we raise will be used to design props of eldritch horror, purchase exotic weapons for epic stage fights, create gorgeous period costumes designed by award winning costume designer Julia Evanovich and, of course, as any good CTHULHU story needs, build <b>giant tentacles</b> with which to assault our heroes. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px;"">But Why Give To This Show? </span></p>
</div>
</div><div> <p>Because nobody else is doing anything like this.  Because we want to bring genuine, unabashed geekery to the stage; the kind of geekery that has been shamefully absent from live theater. Because we're just a small crew of scrappy scoundrels in the big, black 'verse of Seattle theater. Raising <b>$5,000</b> is infinitesimally tiny compared to the budget of a theater like the Seattle Rep, but for a crew like us it feels like trying to make the Kessel run in less than 12 parsecs. Unlike the Seattle Rep, we don't have access to tens of thousands of dollars in government grants and we don't have the backing of Rich White People and their large corporate money. </p>
<p>What we have is you. </p>
<p>And we're telling all new stories--exciting, fun, original stories--stories those big theaters don't want to tell you. All of our money is going to the artists instead of bloated administrative costs. All of our money is going toward innovation and creativity and adventure. And we need you to succeed.<br/></p>

The Rogues Gallery, a Geek Theater Company proudly presents the world premier of ""Shoggoths on the Veldt,"" a CTHULHU adventure comedy by Cameron McNary. Directed by Artistic Director Daniel Wood.






""When famed Victorian explorer Melford Pumbleshire is torn to pieces by something horrible and unseen while on safari in Deepest, Darkest Africa, his redoubtable fiance Euphonia Riggstone must lead an expedition to put his unquiet spirit to rest. In this globe trotting thriller, romance, betrayal, and a two-fisted adventure ensue as Euphonia must deal with perfidious cultists, an amnesiac ghost, ancient horrors and... the Shoggoths on the Veldt!""






 So Who Are You?
Founded by acclaimed director, actor and overall geek Daniel Wood, The Rogues Gallery is a theater company dedicated to producing plays with geek themes. The spark of the idea for this theater company was born at PAX Prime 2010, in front of an audience of 550 geeks during a standing ovation for the world premier of Cameron McNary's play ""Of Dice and Men"", about a group of 30-something Dungeons & Dragons players. It was a monumental experience which famously made Tycho's mom cry. Now Daniel and Cameron are teaming up once again to bring you his newest brilliant incarnation, ""Shoggoths on the Veldt.""
What's This All About Then? 

Putting on a professional play is expensive. Putting on a professional play that includes the kind of special effects necessary for a good CTHULHU story even more so. The $5,000 we raise will be used to design props of eldritch horror, purchase exotic weapons for epic stage fights, create gorgeous period costumes designed by award winning costume designer Julia Evanovich and, of course, as any good CTHULHU story needs, build giant tentacles with which to assault our heroes.  





But Why Give To This Show? 

 Because nobody else is doing anything like this.  Because we want to bring genuine, unabashed geekery to the stage; the kind of geekery that has been shamefully absent from live theater. Because we're just a small crew of scrappy scoundrels in the big, black 'verse of Seattle theater. Raising $5,000 is infinitesimally tiny compared to the budget of a theater like the Seattle Rep, but for a crew like us it feels like trying to make the Kessel run in less than 12 parsecs. Unlike the Seattle Rep, we don't have access to tens of thousands of dollars in government grants and we don't have the backing of Rich White People and their large corporate money. 
What we have is you. 
And we're telling all new stories--exciting, fun, original stories--stories those big theaters don't want to tell you. All of our money is going to the artists instead of bloated administrative costs. All of our money is going toward innovation and creativity and adventure. And we need you to succeed.



Risks & Challenges If we don't raise this money then we will have to perform the play with shoe string and duct tape and pay our artists with a complimentary cheese platter. WE ARE SOMEWHAT INNOVATIVE. But not even we would be able to overcome that disaster.

We wish to offer an artistic home and a creative haven for our actors, directors, writers, and audiences. We welcome you to join us on this exciting journey into our very first full length production.</h4><div><br/></div><i>I Gelosi</i>, by David Bridel, tells the story of Italy's first great traveling theatre troupe. In the late 16th century the Gelosi company takes the provinces by storm, thanks to the beauty, wit and charm of Isabella Andreini, one of the very first women ever to play on the stage. Invited to perform at the Court of King Charles IX of France, the Gelosi become the toast of Europe - until they risk the wrath of the Pope with a virulent theatrical satire...<p><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></i></p><p><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I Gelosi</i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">, is, fittingly for us, a story of the birth of a new theatre company. We follow an ensemble of enthusiastic players and their passions, joys, and despairs, both on and off the stage. In a form of meta-theatre, some serious questions are asked: Who, if anyone, should have authority over the artists' expression? Do we do theatre for fame, for profit, for food, for the love of poetry, or do we do it for a political agenda, revenge, or perhaps out of a deep desire to make sense of our own existence and purpose in life, to heal wounds, uplift hearts, and make a change for the better in the world? </span><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><b>We need to raise $10,000  to cover our production costs.</b></p><p>That $10,000 covers:</p><ul>

We wish to offer an artistic home and a creative haven for our actors, directors, writers, and audiences. We welcome you to join us on this exciting journey into our very first full length production.I Gelosi, by David Bridel, tells the story of Italy's first great traveling theatre troupe. In the late 16th century the Gelosi company takes the provinces by storm, thanks to the beauty, wit and charm of Isabella Andreini, one of the very first women ever to play on the stage. Invited to perform at the Court of King Charles IX of France, the Gelosi become the toast of Europe - until they risk the wrath of the Pope with a virulent theatrical satire...I Gelosi, is, fittingly for us, a story of the birth of a new theatre company. We follow an ensemble of enthusiastic players and their passions, joys, and despairs, both on and off the stage. In a form of meta-theatre, some serious questions are asked: Who, if anyone, should have authority over the artists' expression? Do we do theatre for fame, for profit, for food, for the love of poetry, or do we do it for a political agenda, revenge, or perhaps out of a deep desire to make sense of our own existence and purpose in life, to heal wounds, uplift hearts, and make a change for the better in the world? We need to raise $10,000  to cover our production costs.That $10,000 covers:
Performance space rental at Six01 Studios in Burbank
Rehearsal space rental in Glendale
Raw materials to build the world of our play in a warehouse space
Actor/Designer pay
Lighting and Equipment rental
Costumes
Publicity

<p><i>100 Aker Wood</i> is the first full-length play by Theodore Wolf, who
 graduated from Cornell University in 2013 with a bachelor's degree in 
humor (that's not a joke, it actually happened). Theodore won the 
Heermans-McCalmon Dramatic Writing Competition at Cornell for his short play, <i>King's Gambit</i>,
 which caught the attention of a talent manager in Los Angeles. 
Following graduation, Theodore moved to LA, where he pitched shows to 
networks and took an ungodly number of coffee meetings . After being 
asked to make a pilot ""a little more <i>50 shades</i>,"" he left California to 
return to his original love of playwriting. He is a proud member of the

Under the glow of the GIANT POLYHEDRAL CRAGGROCRAG, amidst the chatter of a GIANT TALKING SKULL, 1700+ attendants yelled in one voice while a bird-man drop-kicked a neon villain in the face. <br/><br/>We now prepare for our 9th party! Thanks to you—the MULTIVERSE—PWR has  become something far beyond what we ever could have imagined. It remains FREE TO ATTEND even as we mount mammoth costs. Here's what we want to do for our next show.<br/><br/>In our ongoing journey to make each of our parties bigger and more bonkers than the last, we've turned our eyes to the sea; we're going underwater. Halloween is the greatest of all party holidays. And so to celebrate, we're going to convert 4th Tap Brewery into a haunted, sunken paradise complete with skeleton pirates, gold, tentacles, barnacled jack-o-lanterns and weird fish! We invite you with us to take a SKELETON CRUISE! Treasure and horror await in equal measure those who venture into the briny deep!</p><p>In a wrestling ring at the bottom of the sea, Dan ""the Man"" Ziglar will stake the PARTYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP BELT in a match with the mighty Dock Master! The anchors and harpoons will surely fly in this NO-HOLDS-BARRED fight to the finish! <br/><br/>Meanwhile, HELLSPORT, inc, continues to tighten its stranglehold on PWR. Can we overthrow these corporate monsters, or will a new dark age swallow PWR? Can our heroes stem the dark tide of chaos? This story, and many others, will be told!<br/><br/>New chapters in the chronicles of Theodosia,  Chad Blitz, Pink Eye, Kippy (age 13), Chubby Uncle Juan and Puggin'Head, the Intergalactic Express, Pasta Man, Luigi Primo, Hot Dog, Dadbod, Baron Zahkey, the Night Mayor, and more all continue this October! And it's all aboard a mouldering, ghostly ship! <br/> </p><h2>What is this money used for?</h2><p><span>$4600 is a lot of money! What’s it going toward?</span></p><p>First, an important recitation: PWR is free and we want to keep it free. PWR is for everyone, even if they can't afford to pay cover at a show. We'd like to keep from having to charge admission for as long as we can.</p><p>PWR is also now a 80-person organization putting on a show for 1700 people. One and a half thundo! Increased expectations beget increased (and wholly worthwhile) costs: we spent just north of $9000 to create WRESTLEVANIA and $11,000 on SLIP N SLAM.</p><p>Through diligent saving and prudent investment, we've managed to <i>reduce</i> the Indiegogo amount for SLAMHAIN by about $1000. That's a big thundo! And it's all on the backs of our beautiful volunteers who submit themselves to the Multiverse out of love. We've survived more than two years as we've grown into the massive wrestling party you know today—and we're not slowing down! Accept no impostors! HELL RIGHT.</p><p>But we still have to deal with the effects of the end of summer, and our newest seasonal expense: COOLING. While it won't be as hot as hot as our July show, we don't want to take any chances, and quality swamp cooler rentals cost $400 apiece. We want to have at least one in the venue so everyone has a comfortable, safe party experience. We’re also paying for the services and equipment of EMTs—now that we’re well over a thousand attendees strong, we want to make sure no catastrophe prevents Trve Kvlt Party Violence.</p><p>Some of the cool things your donations have let us do include:</p><ul>
<li><p>Art and design. We have an extremely talented team of designers who transform the venue into an art piece by using garbage. 4th Tap was turned into a NEON NICKELODEON POWERZONE by their selfless capable hands. Though most of our resources are scavenged from trash bins and thrift stores, filling a venue of our size with cool decorations—and the storage to keep them preserved show after show!—costs money.</p></li>
<li><p>Safe space/security: PWR is a party for everyone. Our performers have always followed anti-sexist/homophobic/transphobic/racist guidelines, and we wanted to make sure that comfort extends to our audience. We’re proud of our security phone line. Any member of the audience may use this number to report gross behavior at the show, and we resolve the problem, no questions asked. Your support lets us keep reaching toward a goal of ULTIMATE PARTY VIOLENCE for everyone.</p></li>
<li><p>Paying artists. Capitalism is whatever, but we work hard to make sure everyone who contributes art gets some money in exchange—whether our art team, our powerful tech wizards, our video crew, or our performers.</p></li>
<li><p>Projection and lighting. Huge audiences compel us to try to use every part of our venue—so that all audience members can find a comfortable view of the show. We’ve found a ton of bargain-barrel prices on new lights, new projector equipment, and new mounts. SKELETON CRUISE will be our best-looking show yet.</p></li>
</ul><p>For transparency: this Indiegogo doesn’t cover all of adolescent PWR’s expenses, but it takes care of a majority of them.

At our last event, your support allowed us to bring our imaginations to life and create a Nickelodeon games-and-sports-themed battle arena. Under the glow of the GIANT POLYHEDRAL CRAGGROCRAG, amidst the chatter of a GIANT TALKING SKULL, 1700+ attendants yelled in one voice while a bird-man drop-kicked a neon villain in the face. We now prepare for our 9th party! Thanks to you—the MULTIVERSE—PWR has  become something far beyond what we ever could have imagined. It remains FREE TO ATTEND even as we mount mammoth costs. Here's what we want to do for our next show.In our ongoing journey to make each of our parties bigger and more bonkers than the last, we've turned our eyes to the sea; we're going underwater. Halloween is the greatest of all party holidays. And so to celebrate, we're going to convert 4th Tap Brewery into a haunted, sunken paradise complete with skeleton pirates, gold, tentacles, barnacled jack-o-lanterns and weird fish! We invite you with us to take a SKELETON CRUISE! Treasure and horror await in equal measure those who venture into the briny deep!In a wrestling ring at the bottom of the sea, Dan ""the Man"" Ziglar will stake the PARTYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP BELT in a match with the mighty Dock Master! The anchors and harpoons will surely fly in this NO-HOLDS-BARRED fight to the finish! Meanwhile, HELLSPORT, inc, continues to tighten its stranglehold on PWR. Can we overthrow these corporate monsters, or will a new dark age swallow PWR? Can our heroes stem the dark tide of chaos? This story, and many others, will be told!New chapters in the chronicles of Theodosia,  Chad Blitz, Pink Eye, Kippy (age 13), Chubby Uncle Juan and Puggin'Head, the Intergalactic Express, Pasta Man, Luigi Primo, Hot Dog, Dadbod, Baron Zahkey, the Night Mayor, and more all continue this October! And it's all aboard a mouldering, ghostly ship!  What is this money used for?$4600 is a lot of money! What’s it going toward?First, an important recitation: PWR is free and we want to keep it free. PWR is for everyone, even if they can't afford to pay cover at a show. We'd like to keep from having to charge admission for as long as we can.PWR is also now a 80-person organization putting on a show for 1700 people. One and a half thundo! Increased expectations beget increased (and wholly worthwhile) costs: we spent just north of $9000 to create WRESTLEVANIA and $11,000 on SLIP N SLAM.Through diligent saving and prudent investment, we've managed to reduce the Indiegogo amount for SLAMHAIN by about $1000. That's a big thundo! And it's all on the backs of our beautiful volunteers who submit themselves to the Multiverse out of love. We've survived more than two years as we've grown into the massive wrestling party you know today—and we're not slowing down! Accept no impostors! HELL RIGHT.But we still have to deal with the effects of the end of summer, and our newest seasonal expense: COOLING. While it won't be as hot as hot as our July show, we don't want to take any chances, and quality swamp cooler rentals cost $400 apiece. We want to have at least one in the venue so everyone has a comfortable, safe party experience. We’re also paying for the services and equipment of EMTs—now that we’re well over a thousand attendees strong, we want to make sure no catastrophe prevents Trve Kvlt Party Violence.Some of the cool things your donations have let us do include:
Art and design. We have an extremely talented team of designers who transform the venue into an art piece by using garbage. 4th Tap was turned into a NEON NICKELODEON POWERZONE by their selfless capable hands. Though most of our resources are scavenged from trash bins and thrift stores, filling a venue of our size with cool decorations—and the storage to keep them preserved show after show!—costs money.
Safe space/security: PWR is a party for everyone. Our performers have always followed anti-sexist/homophobic/transphobic/racist guidelines, and we wanted to make sure that comfort extends to our audience. We’re proud of our security phone line. Any member of the audience may use this number to report gross behavior at the show, and we resolve the problem, no questions asked. Your support lets us keep reaching toward a goal of ULTIMATE PARTY VIOLENCE for everyone.
Paying artists. Capitalism is whatever, but we work hard to make sure everyone who contributes art gets some money in exchange—whether our art team, our powerful tech wizards, our video crew, or our performers.
Projection and lighting. Huge audiences compel us to try to use every part of our venue—so that all audience members can find a comfortable view of the show. We’ve found a ton of bargain-barrel prices on new lights, new projector equipment, and new mounts. SKELETON CRUISE will be our best-looking show yet.
For transparency: this Indiegogo doesn’t cover all of adolescent PWR’s expenses, but it takes care of a majority of them. Below is our complete budget.Show Expenses: $1645Misc: $50Props: $200Art: $650Food: $100Promo materials: $100Security: $160Insurance: $385Printing: $200Operational Expenses: $850Ring Repairs: $150Discretionary Show Expenses: $300New Projects Capital: $400Other Expenses: $3832Artist pay: $2100Indiegogo fees & fulfillment: $1732
Extremely Hype Swag
 
Whoa! Are you ready for this?
It's the Donor T-shirt Design, only available to you through the Indiegogo! Whoa! Brought to you by PWR artist Zug Goodina—it's spooky! Scary! And it appears on the Donor Shirt and Raglan tee. Whoa! {note: This is a rough draft of the image - the final version will be even more detailed and radical!}

 
Below, the die-cut pin! It looks even hyper in real life.

 
Here's the pillowcase! Professor Snooze will fireman's carry you quickly to the Dream Realm once your cheek presses against this bad boy!

What do we have here? Why, it's the Theodosia and Bench Horse Wrestlebuddies!

<p><b>Help fund the October reading of
""The Battles.""</b></p>
<p>Hi Theatre Lovers!   </p>
<p>Ned Massey here, the author of the
new musical, ""The Battles."" The show is so close to a pivotal step in
its development, and I hope you can help us make that step a reality.</p>
<p>“The Battles” is about a painting
competition that took place between Leonardo Da Vinci and Michelangelo in
Florence, Italy around the year 1500. But more than that, it’s about how fear
and bigotry can infect individuals and society. It’s about how terribly easy it
is, sometimes, to shut out love. Both artists’ lives were shaped by the hatred
directed toward homosexuals in the Renaissance, and the show explores how each

""The Battles.""
Hi Theatre Lovers!   
Ned Massey here, the author of the
new musical, ""The Battles."" The show is so close to a pivotal step in
its development, and I hope you can help us make that step a reality.
“The Battles” is about a painting
competition that took place between Leonardo Da Vinci and Michelangelo in
Florence, Italy around the year 1500. But more than that, it’s about how fear
and bigotry can infect individuals and society. It’s about how terribly easy it
is, sometimes, to shut out love. Both artists’ lives were shaped by the hatred
directed toward homosexuals in the Renaissance, and the show explores how each
of them—despite their visionary work—wrestled with shame and doubt in a way
that may be all too familiar to contemporary audiences.
  I've been working on “The Battles”
for the past 5 years, and it's finally ready
to present to theatre professionals!
Musical theatre at even this level of
presentation --a staged reading-- is very expensive, but I am incredibly
fortunate to have much of the funding in place. We need just a little more to

</p><p>I’m thrilled to tell
you about the world premiere of <a href=""http://www.barabbastheatre.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>H5x7</i></a>, my new adaptation of Shakespeare’s <i>Henry V</i> to be performed by seven actors.
Get it? <i>H5x7</i>? This will be the second
production of <a href=""http://www.barabbastheatre.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Barabbas Theatre</a>, a company I founded last year for the
highly successful world premiere of Alexandra Petri’s <a href=""http://www.barabbastheatre.com/productions/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Never Never</i></a>. If you didn’t see it, click the link
and read our outstanding reviews.</p>
<p>In keeping with our
core belief that great theatre can come in many forms, we’re pivoting from
contemporary tragicomedy to Shakespearean history this year. With <i>H5x7</i>, we take our cue from the Chorus of
<i>Henry V, </i>who urges the audience to
use its imagination to aid the players in portraying the momentous events of
King Harry’s campaign for the French crown during the Hundred Years’ War. In
that spirit, seven actors–four men and three women–will play 30 roles, aided by
the simplest of sets, props, and costumes. The siege at Harfleur, the antics of
the Eastcheap crew, the glorious and terrible Battle of Agincourt, and Harry’s
wooing of France’s Princess Katharine will all be brought to life through the
skill of the ensemble cast and your willingness to “eke out our performance
with your mind.”</p>
<p><b>Barabbas Theatre has set itself a high
bar for artistic excellence. To live up to that standard we need your help.</b> Our expenses for <i>H5x7</i> will come to about $3,500. About 35% of that goes to paying the
artists involved in bringing the play to life. About 28% is taken up by fees
paid to Capital Fringe—they provide the venue, technical equipment, box office,
some marketing, and insurance. Another 26% will go toward getting people in the
seats. The remaining 11% is what we have left for the set, props, and costumes.</p>
<p>We’re trying to raise
$2,500 to help meet these expenses and are asking you to consider making a
donation to our company. </p>
<p></p>
<p>I know you receive
many requests for money for many worthy causes. But I’m asking you to recognize
the intrinsic value of great theatre by supporting the world premiere of <i>H5x7</i>. Barabbas Theatre puts artistic
merit above all else. We began proving that with <i>Never Never</i>, and we aim to enhance our reputation with <i>H5x7</i>. I hope you agree that this mission
is worthy of your support.</p>

WHERE YOUR MONEY IS GOINGYour contribution will help pay the amazing performers that are working on this piece with me - Osamu Uehara, Sumi Matsumoto, and Mel Khaw.  We started rehearsing in the fall of 2015 and a $20 contribution will help pay for one hour of rehearsal rental.We are hoping to show the full length version of ""Shadows of Hiroshima"" in film festivals throughout the world.  Part of your contribution will pay for post-production editing, color corrections, and sound editing of the entire video.   

  The ImpactYour contribution will help to create a continued awareness of the ongoing prejudices that continue to repress us today.
  Risks & Challenges

 

The challenge is to get as many people to see""Them"" and ""Shadows of Hiroshima"" outside my wonderful and supportive circle of friends who will help to spread the word.

<p>Folk Dance Remixed believes in diversity, creativity and spreading joy. Our shows and workshops show off the best that can be achieved when people work together, sharing their cultures, their music, their dance moves - their positivity! Our inspiring workshops get families up and dancing together and strangers holding hands and laughing within minutes, our work truly touches all that come into contact with it!<br/><br/>Our current show, Step Hop House, depicts the coming together of diverse travellers to new land and how they work and play together – mixing together folk, hip-hop, live music, Bollywood, capoeira, African, contemporary, beatbox and maypole traditions into a funky folkyness!</p>
<p>What We Need &amp; What You Get</p>
<p>We need £2250 from our crowdfunding appeal to help us devise new shows and participatory workshops for children, young people, families and adults.</p>
<p>Your help will enable us do more education work with young people and artists – training them and dance leaders with new choreography, devising new approaches of teaching, and working with musicians to make great accompaniments.</p>
<p>Your help will secure the creativity and research needed to bring new ideas and formats to rehearsal, and enable the company to spend valuable time developing our innovative brand of funked up folkyness to delight audiences across the country. It will contribute to studio time for the artistic directors to experiment and devise; rehearsal costs for the company; costume development; technical experimentation and equipment (those maypole ribbons need to be shiny and perfect each time you see them!).</p>
<p>Every £1 donation helps make our grants and support go further and helps secure our hard work and innovation. Our crowdfunding donations will be combined with our current Arts Council England grant, and our in-kind support from partners East London Dance and the English Folk Dance and Song Society.<br/>Please donate what you can to keep this joyous and eclectic company pushing forwards into the ground breaking territory. Every £1 helps keeps us creating! THANK YOU!</p>
<p>The Impact</p>
<p>Our work brings people together – it creates connections, makes people laugh and enjoy a dynamic and colourful spectacle. Don’t take our word for it – here’s some comments from people that have worked with us and seen our work themselves:</p>
<p> “It was wonderful to see so many young people from across the North West performing at the beginning of U Dance 2016.  The blend of traditional folk dance and contemporary hip hop clearly enabled all the young people to express their individuality.  The piece seemed to bring folk dance to life for a new generation and the energy and obvious enthusiasm of the performers was infectious!  It was great to see traditional folk dance embraced as a vibrant part of young people’s dance in the UK.” </p>
<p>Ginny Brown, Head of Education &amp; Training, Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We received some wonderful comments about your performances and workshops and how they were engaging and inclusive as well as visually stunning!</p>
<p>Rachel Wood, Arts Development Officer, Oldham Council</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The dancers were wonderful, as were the musicians, and I was thrilled to see the fantastic ceilidh take-up at the end, bought a lump to my throat as these things always do when done so well.</p>
<p>Michael Hambridge, Arts and Cultural Development Officer, Hastings Borough Council</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Street Dance the Maypole was a brilliant visual focal point, filling the space with colours and energy. The teachers were quick to adapt the level of the workshop to the ability of the participants ... everyone really enjoyed themselves!</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Thank you again for making the show energetic and dynamic – everyone enjoyed your performance!  </p>
<p>Rozina Ahmed, Senior Events Officer, Events for London, Mayor’s Office</p>
<p> ‘I just wanted to say how much I enjoyed the show last night – a great mix of dance styles blended into a cohesive performance full of energy, skill and a real sense of joy!  Lovely costumes and colourful props created a terrific environment in which to perform.  All the elements worked well (I loved the “mumming” reference!) and I can see the potential (as you surely can) for this to grow into a bigger show with educational aspects and huge workshop potential.’  </p>
<p>Barry Goodman, President of The Morris Federation</p>
<p>Opportunity to see cutting-edge real/ genuine “folk dance” of today. The sensational performance – when it finished I wanted to see it again, immediately. Loved the mix, meld and marriage of styles that is creating a new tradition.</p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>Hi! My name is Lauren Scott. I am currently a junior at Colorado State University studying Theater and Business. Last year I had the amazing opportunity of being cast in CSU's production of <i>Alice in Wonderland. </i>It was an immensely fulfilling experience I won't soon forget. I played the role of The Duchess and was nominated for an Irene Ryan award through the Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival. What does this mean? It means that on February 17th I get the opportunity to head to Ellensburg, Washington where this year's festival is being held to compete for this amazing scholarship and honor as well as network with potential future employers. The audition process for the Irene Ryan is to perform a monologue and, with a scene partner, perform two contrasting scenes. I have chosen the immensely talented Mason Weiss to be my scene partner. Both of us have already been working extensively to find the perfect scenes to work on for the next two months. But, we can not get out to Washington for this spectacular opportunity without your help. With your contributions and help in sharing what we are trying to achieve out in Washington, Mason and I will be able to afford travel costs (flight and bus) as well as the cost of the hotel for the week and the registration cost of the festival. Please help us take advantage of this unmatched opportunity to follow our dreams of working in this impeccable industry that is theater!</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Here is an extremely rough estimation, per person, of what kind of funding we need and where it will go:</p>
<p>Flight: $400 (round trip)</p>
<p>Shuttle: $80 (round trip)</p>
<p>Hotel: $150</p>
<p>Festival registration: $83</p>
<p>If all of this is exactly correct, which at this point it is not the exact costs but very good estimates, we are looking at $713 for Mason and $713 for me, Lauren. </p>
<p>But, it is not all about us. We appreciate all the help and support each and everyone one of you are willing to give us whether that is sharing our campaign with friends, contributing $1, or anything else. So, we have come up with some very special perks just for you:</p>
<p>1) If you can contribute just $5, not only will you being helping us on our journey to Washington, but you will also receive a personalized ""thank you"" from Mason and I.</p>
<p>2) If you can contribute $20, you can receive a digital diary of pictures from our time in Washington.</p>
<p>We appreciate all of you and the time you are willing to give our campaign!</p>
<ul> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Theater is something that can be enjoyed by all and can create some very special conversations that nothing else can. Mason and I want to be able to pursue our goal of performing, something we each have a deep passion for. This is one of the greatest opportunities we will have to get our names out there and further our theater training with other students and faculty from across our region. </p>
<p>This will also have an immense impact on how people perceive theater in Colorado. Our university has a growing, outstanding program that we want to be able to showcase to others. This opportunity will also prove that Colorado, and Fort Collins specifically, has some amazing talent. This trip could have the potential of bringing light to all this university and community has to offer. </p>
<ul> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>This scholarship is extremely competitive and requires quite a large amount of time and energy. However, Mason and I are more than ready to soak up all the opportunities and learning experiences we will surely gain from this experience. Like I briefly mentioned earlier, we have already taken steps to find the ideal scenes to show off all our talent. We have also set up meetings with faculty and a showcase to be performed in January for us and our fellow CSU nominees to get feedback on our work. Overall, we are going into this adventure with positive attitudes and excitement to just have a fun, fulfilling experience. </p>
<ul> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>As college students, we understand that sometimes it is not realistic to contribute monetarily to things you are passionate about. And that is okay! Help us get the word out through your own personal group of friends, family, and colleagues. Use Facebook, Twitter, or any other form of communication to get the word out about our campaign. We hope that you believe in and can support our goal to get out to Ellensburg, Washington for the Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival in any way you can!</p>

1) If you can contribute just $5, not only will you being helping us on our journey to Washington, but you will also receive a personalized ""thank you"" from Mason and I.
2) If you can contribute $20, you can receive a digital diary of pictures from our time in Washington.
We appreciate all of you and the time you are willing to give our campaign!
 
  The Impact Theater is something that can be enjoyed by all and can create some very special conversations that nothing else can. Mason and I want to be able to pursue our goal of performing, something we each have a deep passion for. This is one of the greatest opportunities we will have to get our names out there and further our theater training with other students and faculty from across our region. 
This will also have an immense impact on how people perceive theater in Colorado. Our university has a growing, outstanding program that we want to be able to showcase to others. This opportunity will also prove that Colorado, and Fort Collins specifically, has some amazing talent. This trip could have the potential of bringing light to all this university and community has to offer. 
 
  Risks & Challenges This scholarship is extremely competitive and requires quite a large amount of time and energy. However, Mason and I are more than ready to soak up all the opportunities and learning experiences we will surely gain from this experience. Like I briefly mentioned earlier, we have already taken steps to find the ideal scenes to show off all our talent. We have also set up meetings with faculty and a showcase to be performed in January for us and our fellow CSU nominees to get feedback on our work. Overall, we are going into this adventure with positive attitudes and excitement to just have a fun, fulfilling experience. 
 
  Other Ways You Can Help As college students, we understand that sometimes it is not realistic to contribute monetarily to things you are passionate about. And that is okay! Help us get the word out through your own personal group of friends, family, and colleagues. Use Facebook, Twitter, or any other form of communication to get the word out about our campaign. We hope that you believe in and can support our goal to get out to Ellensburg, Washington for the Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival in any way you can!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We are a tiny high school theatre troupe trying to put on a show that won't bust the budget.  Unfortunately, due to time constraints, budget issues and many other events, we don't have a band or the money for a band.  We are trying to raise enough funds to cover the cost of the computer program to run it for us. <br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The production really is for the students.  They get the chance to perform or help backstage and become part of a real production.  If we don't raise enough funds, it will be next to impossible to run a similar program for the students next year.  <br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need about $2500 dollars to cover the cost of the computer program for a band as well as some of the performance rights.  The school is helping with the cost of set, location, costumes, props, etc.  Without this money, we will be in the hole and have to try other fundraising methods to recover the lost funds.<br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Get the word out!  The show is on Dec 7 and 8 at the Norman Rothstein Theatre in Vancouver.  The kids want to play to full houses (and ticket sales will help with the cost as well).  Tickets are $12 for adults and $10 for students.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p></p>
<p><b><i>Introducing Us..</i></b>.</p>
<p>This is a play based on our story. We are husband and wife team, Craig and Shelly. We weren't always husband and wife, in fact, for most of our  story we weren't even together... cue pivotal plot moment in the form of surprise parenthood, and that's where <i>And Then There Were 3</i> kicks off. Two new parents struggling hilariously to find themselves, their identities and battle through the mind field that is parenthood. Our story started where the play does, 7 years ago and being theatre makers we got to the point of wanting to share it.</p>
<br/><p><b><i>Why we want to do this...</i></b></p>
<p>What started as a comic review, progressed into more of a vessel for us. A vessel to share our story,  to admit that parenting can be ridiculously hard, to shed light on the fact that dad's get Post Natal Depression too,  and a way for us to help other parents realise that they are not alone.  Parenting isn't always easy, kids don't come with instruction manuals, and if you are up the creek like we were, here's our way of handing you a paddle. Not a paddle in the form of answers, but one that shows others have been there before. The show also has a very resounding through line about always following your dreams. Getting this play up and running professionally is one of ours...  Of course we also like to laugh... a lot... so we threw in a ninja!</p>
<br/><p><b><i>What you will help us achieve...</i></b></p>
<p>Our goal is to have this show touring nationally and then internationally. The money raised from this campaign will help us produce the premiere performance of <i>And Then There Were 3</i> in Canberra Australia, as the first step in our goal towards taking this story all over the world. If we get the full amount we will be able to produce this first production in a fully professional capacity, pay all our cast and creatives properly and through its first few performances hopefully soothe some parents, inspire others and of course; laugh the socks off hundreds of unsuspecting <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">theatre goers.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p></p>
<p><span><i><b>Where will the money go?</b></i></span></p>
<p><span>If we raise $10,000, it will cover the bare minimum production cost. The set, the sound and the lighting.... this means no one working on the project gets paid (or if they do it comes from our considerably empty pockets (and there is only so far lint goes!).)</span></p>
<p>If we raise $25,000, the extra $15 grand goes to paying our production artists reasonable fees to deliver the project - this means our musician, to create original music for the show,(and he's awesome and talented!) a designer for the set, costumes, props and puppet, and a lighting designer... </p>
<p>The full $45,000 would cover all the above plus our actors to rehearse and perform the show (which at equity rates is approx $4500 each), give us some money toward publicity,  cover a directors fee and also cover the cost of a much needed babysitter so we can actually rehearse the show!</p>
<p>Obviously if we don't raise the full amount, we will make sure our artists get paid first (at least something) and we will find money to feed the kids elsewhere... (Yes imagine mini violin playing in the background)...</p>
<p><span><i><b>What you can get...</b></i></span></p>
<p>The most intangible but important reward you will get by supporting this show is the satisfaction of knowing you have; helped other parents feel identified, supported and connected; inspired people to find their own identities and follow their dreams; and of course you are supporting artists, acknowledging their creative contributions deserve remuneration. You will also be one of the first people to support a production that has the potential to be the next big thing!</p>
<p><b><i>The Perks</i></b></p>Ever wanted to be an executive producer? Get a preview of a new show before anyone else? Send advice from a precocious Mother In Law to a friend or acquaintance? Have a Skype conversation with a whisky drinking baby puppet, meet the cast and crew to a show, or have them record a thank you message especially for you?... Have a look at all the perks we offer and find the one right for you! <p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Supporting this project means; supporting and creating a voice for parents, raising awareness of Paternal Post Natal Depression, supporting talented artists, bringing joy and laughter to hundreds of theatre goers and believing in a world where we all have the ability to craft our own paths and create our dreams...</p>
<p>Craig and I have a long history in theatre, co founding our own theatre company in 2002 and producing over 20 productions. We wrote our first show (<i>The Toilet Monologues</i>) together 8 years ago, with a couple of kids shows written in between, and have come together now to create <i>3</i>, which is easily the best work we have created together - helped greatly by the professional dramaturgy of Peter Matherson (Dramaturg credits include: Sydney Theatre Company, Melbourne Theatre Company, La Boite and Australian Council for the Arts.) It's raw, it's real, it's honest - and it is incredibly funny!</p>
<p>We really feel that this story has 'legs' and the ability to touch many people. We just need your help in these first stages to get it up and off the ground running! A great premiere production will mean hugely increasing our chances of being picked up for a national tour and this show reaching more  people and going further than a tiny studio theatre season. </p>

<p>My name is Ashley Malloy and I am a senior at Central Connecticut State University pursuing a BFA degree in theatre performance.</p>
</div>
<p>This summer, I am producing and performing in the one woman show, My Name is Rachel Corrie. This impactful piece chronicles Rachel's journey from her home in Olympia, WA to the Gaza Strip, where she discovers her purpose in life through the International Solidarity Movement and develops a deeper humanitarian and political consciousness. The play is comprised exclusively of Rachel's writings, and takes us up to the fateful moment of Rachel's death. </p>
<p>Rachel Corrie planted herself in the path of an Israeli bulldozer that was aiming to demolish a Palestinian family's home. Although she was completely visible to the driver, Rachel's body was crushed, and she died only moments after. She is an icon in the Palestinian community, representing an enduring hope and indomitable spirit, elements which fuel the non-violent resistance she practiced and preached.</p>
<p>I am taking this project on as an actor looking to grow as an artist, as well as an ally of Palestine who believes in the power of creative resistance against the occupation.</p>
<p>ALL funds raised from the production will go directly to The Freedom Theatre in the Jenin refugee camp. This theatre redirects young people's  violent inclinations towards the Israeli occupation by equipping them with artistic skills they can use as their new tools of resistance. </p>
<p>Since the theatre was founded by actor Juliano Mer-Khamis in 2006, dozens of young men and women have found a safe haven where they can express themselves without limitations they are usually presented with in their day to day lives. Actors of the Freedom Theatre have ventured to the US where they have met such luminaries as Tony Kushner and Paula Vogel. Their work has been featured at the New York Theatre Workshop, where their production of The Island by Athol Fugard will run for a limited time this September. You can learn more about the Freedom Theatre at the link below:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.thefreedomtheatre.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.thefreedomtheatre.org/</a></p>
<p>Your donations will go towards costumes, props, printing programs, and other details that are integral to the production. Any extra funds will go directly to the Freedom Theatre to add to money raised from the production. Please donate whatever you can comfortably provide. And know that your generosity is empowering the creative cultural resistance of Palestinian youth by bringing Rachel Corrie's story to life.</p>

<p>My Name is Rachel Corrie will be performed September 5th, 6th, and 7th at 7:30 in Davidson Hall, room 123 at Central Connecticut State University. There is a suggested donation of $5.00. The show runs approximately 70 minutes, and there is no intermission.</p>

<p><b>Arts Alliance presents Urinetown!</b></p>
<p>Arts
Alliance is the oldest and largest student arts group at Northwestern
University. It is a non-profit organization founded by a collection of groups
looking to share space, and has grown to become one of the largest student arts
organizations in the country. Its annual season consists of four mainstage
shows including The Dolphin Show, America's Largest Student Produced Musical,
and the management of three Satellite groups: Thunk A Cappella, Graffiti
Dancers, and Mee-Ow Improv &amp; Sketch Comedy.</p>
<p>Arts
Alliance’s primary goal is to provide diverse, accessible, and fulfilling
artistic experiences to enrich students from all different parts of the
Northwestern University community. Arts Alliance is rooted in its long-standing
traditions and continues to seek out new artistic opportunities. It provides a
positive atmosphere in which students can learn and work alongside a supportive
board to create exciting, professional-quality productions.</p>
<p>This
year, Arts Alliance is proud to present <i>Urinetown:
The Musical</i> as its early fall show.<span> 
Urinetown satirizes capitalism, populism and legal system in general,
but it also parodies other Broadway classics. 
The musical takes place in a town where the public amenities are run by
the government and the citizens must pay in order to use the bathroom.  Urinetown asks audience members to laugh, to
cry and to take a second look—whether that be at our government or conventional
musical structures.  </span></p>

<p><i>Urinetown </i>is
one of the first plays of the school year, and so it is especially geared
toward making freshmen aware and excited about the theatre on Northwestern’s
campus.<span>  We want to inspire
freshmen—whether they are theatre majors or not—to take advantage of the amazing
opportunities Northwestern theatre has to offer.  Whether that be continuing to see shows on
campus throughout the year, auditioning, or working on a production team, we
want to encourage students to continue to have a connection to the theatre community
at Northwestern and beyond.  </span></p>
<p>From the perspective of future
audience members, we hope that their reaction walking away after the show
includes not only a respect for and enjoyment of theatre, but also a conscious
response to the demographic diversity of the audience.<span>  We hope that the theatre is filled with a
wide range of people from different parts of campus, including people of many
majors, ethnicities, and ages.  We hope
these people feel excited and empowered to discuss the show with each other and
to carry its message and their experience with them after they leave the
theatre.</span></p>
<p>Above all else we hope to bring
the joy of theatre to the Northwestern community.<span>  For us, this can only be accomplished if we
can make <i>Urinetown </i>accessible to all
parts of campus, with a focus on freshmen and non-theatre majors.  The theatre community at Northwestern has so
much to offer, and whether incoming students apply as theatre majors, or simply
just enjoy seeing shows, their participation perpetuates that joy of theatre.
We hope that our production of <i>Urinetown</i>
builds on the appreciation and love for theatre that already exists on
Northwestern’s campus by motivating new theatre goers to experience more
theatre and old theatre lovers to see their craft in a different light.</span></p>

<p><font size=""5""><span style=""line-height: 30px;"">About Inclined Dance Project...</span></font></p>
<p></p>
<p>Inclined Dance Project began in January 2009 as informal rehearsals between director Kristen Klein and her friend's and fellow dance colleagues from The Boston Conservatory. Initially started as a way to experiment with movement and various choreographic exploits, these experimental rehearsals eventually took shape leading Kristen Klein to found Inclined Dance Project, with the company premiering in July 2009. </p>
<p>Our 2013 Company Dancers include: Amy Campbell, Christina Chelette, Chie Mukai, Morgana Phlaum, Jennifer Radcliffe, and Lucy Stack.</p>
<p>Inclined Dance Project is now in it's 4th year of making work, but in those 4 years we have yet to produce our own individual season. The company has toured and performed Kristen Klein's work through the platforms of Festivals, Showcases, and Split-Bills, building our audience and expanding the company's repertoire. Since 2009 we have created over 12 original works, and we are currently working on completing our very first full length work <i>Stuck Together Pieces</i> (which will be another milestone for IDP!). We'll be self-producing our very own weekend of performances this Fall and premiering the completed <i>Stuck Together Pieces</i> in November. And we need your help!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Help Support Our Dream...</h3>
<div><p>Being a small, independent dance company in NYC is tough business. For the past 4 years, ALL of the company's expenses have been covered by Artistic Director Kristen Klein from her own funds. This means a lot of part-time jobs, a lot of budgeting, and a lot of serious planning on her part! Rehearsal space, venue costs, costumes, dancer compensation, music fees, video/photography costs...it all adds up. In order to produce our first Inclined Season we need a bit more than Kristen's pocket change to put on the best show we can. That's where you come in! With your support, we can make the following dreams come true:</p></div>
<ul>
<li><p>The successful production of Inclined's first Independent Season at the Center for Performance Research. No more split-bills, no more festivals...just a full weekend showcasing Inclined's amazing dancers and Kristen Klein's choreography. Its been 4 years of waiting and planning...help us make this happen!</p></li>
<li>
<p>The completion of our first full length work, <i>Stuck Together Pieces</i>. This piece has been almost a full year in the making! Focusing on improvisation combined with set choreography, the piece targets the themes of connecting, re-connecting, and disconnecting among human beings. The piece has been presented in partial segments at workshops and venues throughout 2012-2013 including The Muse, The Sgorous Theater, and The Flea Theater. The completed work will be premiering at the Center for Performance Research in November 2013.</p>

<li>Portland deserves a great, cool, quirky, fun, and professional unscripted theatre troupe, and they finally have one.  We are The Unscriptables, and we present long-form unscripted shows in a variety of genres.  The founders, Andy Barrett and Trenton Shine, have been working together for 20 years, writing, directing, producing, and performing.  Our dedicated and talented cast helps us bring the audience a unique, entertaining, and satisfying theatre experience.</li>
</ul><h2>Campaign Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>We are launching this campaign to raise funds for our 2013-2014 season.  We really want to raise the bar this year, and as with all ambitious projects, money is usually a factor.  With adequate funding, we can bring to life shows that we've talked about for years.  We are always striving to push the envelope creatively, to create that ""wow"" factor our audience has come to expect.  This can't be done without the help of many people.  That's where you, our supporters, come in.</li>

Ich habe keine Nachricht. Ich bin weder Politiker, noch Priester, noch ein Publizist oder Werbedienst. Ich will das Theater von allen seinen Missionen befreien, und es an und für sich gelten lassen. Alles was ich habe sind Bilder, Wahrnehmungen, Texte, die mich bewegen, Musik, die mich erschüttert, Erfahrungen... Damit gehen wir auf die Bühne und konfrontieren sie mit dem notwendigen Kriterium des Theaters: Raum. Ich habe und will nicht mehr als diese Elemente, da ich den semantische Raum frei halten möchte, um aus der Konfrontation der genannten Materialien mit dem physischen Raum vollkommen unerhoffte semantische Zusammenhänge entstehen lassen zu können. Meine Absicht ist nicht beabsichtig, vorsätzlich oder absichtlich. Wenn das Theater endlich autonom werden will, sollte es auch autonom arbeiten, ohne dem Text, der Aussage, oder sonst irgendetwas Zweitrangigem etwas zu schulden. Nichts ist von vornherein gegeben, alles ist zu konstruieren! Das Resultat, könnte man mit Deleuze sagen, sind Perzepte.</span></span></p>

If I were to express my message, it would be my lack thereof. I don't want to say anything. I am not a politician, nor a priest, nor publicist, nor pundit. I want to liberate theater from all its purported missions, to let it be itself, all by itself. What I have are images, sensations, texts which affect me, music which makes me tremble. With these elements, we will attack the stage, allowing them to confront the necessary criterion of all theater: space.
Beyond these elements, I neither have nor want more. I want to keep open all possibilities of meaning, so that from this confrontation can be born unexpectable semantic links and connections. My intention is not intentional. If theater is to be autonomous, it should work in an autonomous manner, without being beholden to the text, the message, or any other element which is not properly theatrical. Everything will be constructed out of this confrontation, this clash between space and sense. The result, we could say with Deleuze, will be percepts.
This work will be a theatrical, performative research. To allow for this confrontation of sense and space, without teleology or a priori expectations, will demand much of the actors : great patience, generosity and productive power. The actors themselves, then, will take part in the creation of the work. It is not, then, about a director's imposition: the result will be, rather, a collective creation. I will not take the position of the subject of supposed knowledge. I would like to open a space of insecurity, doubt, ignorance, without the need to perform as the one who knows. The work will be without a master. It will be a process that will be thought, proposed, and performed by ourselves.
About the aesthetic we will be searching for: I consider that naturalism remains our biggest enemy. Let us search for abstraction in theater. Let us search for defiguration, for transfiguration. Let us go there with force. Let us strive beyond ourselves.
The actors will have to give themselves over with both body and soul, risking in this uncertain space their “mental health,” approaching the very limits of madness. Everything will be done without compromise. It is only here where we can find our creative power.
I'm not afraid of human pathos. A non-pathetic pathos.
About me: Born in Germany, I spent 5 years in Montreal, Canada. I studied psychology, and finished a bachelor's degree in France. It was in France that my discovery of theater changed the direction of my life. Since then, all my decisions have been directed towards theater and towards the possibility of free creation. I began by acting, but quickly came to the mise en scène. Last year I staged Le songe ou un jeu de rêve(“A dream play”) by A.Strindberg, interspersed with texts by Dostoyevsky, Rilke, Lautréamont, Baudelaire and others. This prior work was for me a sort of stylistic prefiguration, taking the form of a theatrical construction site: http://theatre-vitez.com/2012/05/festival-3-jours-et-plus-4/
By contributing to this project, you will help young creators realize their fundamental need: production, a production freed from the alienation of monetary exigencies. At the same time, you will help to defend a free theater, a theater which is absolutely necessary, a theater which is political without committing itself to a 'political message'. It is the variation around the standard (to again borrow the words of Deleuze).
Though this will not cost a great deal, there are costs involved. Here is a prognostic budget:
 








Expenses


 




Costumes


150,00 €




Accessories


150,00 €




Paint


30,00 €




Transport


100,00 €




Rehearsal space, rent for 40 days


1000,00 €




Printing


50,00 €




TOTAL


1480,00 €



As you can see, our largest expense will be the renting of a stage for rehearsal. At the time of writing, we are looking for spaces which will allow us to work for free. In general, however, our only options are cooperative organizations which are also short on funding, or spaces in which it is only possible to work for a very short time once a week. For our project, such conditions will not suffice. This would necessitate the exclusion of many theatrical elements, such as lighting, sound and stage design, due to logistical constraints. The rest of our budget is proof that we are making 'poor theater' (to borrow a term from Grotowski).In the event that some money remains after the completion of this project, it will be used for the second part of the diptych, Esquisse # 2: une ode, to be created by a larger team in the upcoming year.
What do you get for your contribution? Normally the first question in our capitalistic society. In fact, this is a hard question to answer when our 'product' is theater, because it is not a mechanically reproducible art form (which is, by the way, its beauty, its cruelty, its strength, its uniqueness). Of course you can get a free entrance to a show if you are in Marseille. If not you will at least get a postcard.
If you give a bit more, we will write about you. Yes! It's not a material compensation, but a personal one. A team of young men and women will write about you, perhaps on the other side of the world, and even if they don't know you at all. And if you give even a little more, we will send the texts to you.
If by chance giving is not a possibility, but you nevertheless are interested in the project we are working on, you can also share it with friends and family and spread the word.
If you have any questions, we would be happy to answer them. Don't hesitate. We will keep this site updated, and get a video of our next rehearsal session. The photos you are seeing come from our first three days of work.
Thank you for your interest,M.S.

(German will follow)
Si je peux dire une chose, c'est que je ne veux et ne peux rien dire. Je n'ai pas de message à livrer. Je ne suis ni prêtre, ni politicien, ni publicitaire. Tout ce que j'ai, c'est des images, des sensations, des émotions, des textes qui me secouent, des musiques qui m'ébranlent, des expériences. C'est avec cela que j'irai sur le plateau. C'est ces images, sensations, émotions, textes, musiques, etc que je confronterai à un des critères définitionnels nécessaires du théâtre, c'est-à-dire à l'espace. 
À part ces éléments, je n'aurai rien de plus. Je veux garder l'espace sémantique ouvert pour que cette confrontation des matériaux avec un espace (physique) donné puisse ouvrir des espaces sémantiques insoupçonnés. Ma démarche n'est justement pas intentionnelle, je n'ai pas dessiné un dessein. Mais si le théâtre veut devenir un jour un art autonome, il faudrait qu'il commence à travailler d'une manière autonome, c'est-à-dire ne plus rien devoir au texte, au message ou à tout autre élément secondaire. Rien n'est donné d'avance, tout est à construire! Le résultat, pourrait-on dire avec Deleuze, seront des percepts.
Il s'agira d'un réel travail de recherche. Confronter librement, sans à-priori, ouvertement, ces matériaux au plateau, demandera aux acteurs et actrices une patience, une générosité, une force de proposition. Il s'agira d'un réel travail de création de la part des acteurs/actrices. C'est dans ce sens qu'il s'agira d'une création quelque part collective. Je ne prendrai aucunement la position du savoir supposé. Je ne saurai pas, pas plus que n'importe qui d'autre. Je voudrais qu'on ouvre un espace d'insécurité, de doute, de non-savoir sans que je sois obligé de jouer le rôle de celui qui sait. En d'autres mots, j'aimerais arriver à une existence de travail théâtral sans maître, que nous pensions, agissions et créions par nous-mêmes.
Pour ce qui est de l'esthétique que j'aimerais rechercher, je considère que le naturalisme demeure l'ennemi absolu. Cherchons l'abstraction au théâtre. Cherchons la défiguration. Mais allons y avec puissance. Allons au delà de nous-mêmes. Les acteurs devront se plonger corps et âme dans cette espace incertain, au risque de leur santé mental, se promenant sur la limite de la folie. Chaque proposition de jeu doit être sans retenue, au risque de tout, sans compromis; et ce serait là dedans qu'on trouvera un plaisir et une réelle puissance.
N'ayons pas peur du pathos humain. D'un pathos non-pathétique.
Un mot sur moi : né en Allemagne, j'ai vécu cinq ans à Montréal (Québec), Canada. J'y ai commencé à étudier la psychologie et j'ai terminé ma licence 3 en France. Durant cette année, j'ai découvert le théâtre et rien de moins que le sens de ma vie. Depuis-lors, tous mes choix sont dirigés vers le théâtre et une possibilité de créer librement. Je suis entré au théâtre en jouant, mais j'ai touché rapidement à la mise en scène. L'année dernière, j'ai mis en scène Le songe ou un jeu de rêve d'August Strindberg intercallé avec des textes de Dostoïevski, Rilke, Lautréamont, Baudelaire et autres. Ce travail préfigurait alors ce présent projet en tant qu'il s'agissait d'une mise en place d'un vaste chantier théâtral: http://theatre-vitez.com/2012/05/festival-3-jours-et-plus-4/
En contribuant à ce projet, vous aidez des jeunes créateurs à pouvoir travailler et donc à réaliser leur nécessité; et dans ce cas, à défendre un théâtre libre, un théâtre qui croit qu'il est crucial, qu'il est absolument nécessaire dans notre société, un théâtre qui est profondément politique même en ne l'étant pas explicitement, qui est une variation autour de l'étendard standard (en parlant encore une fois avec des termes deleuzien).
Même si cela n'a pas un prix exorbitant, cela coûte quelque chose. Voici un budget prévisionnel :







Dépenses


 





Costumes


150,00 €




Accessoires


150,00 €




Maquillage


30,00 €




Transports


100,00 €




Résidences, loyer pour 40 jours


1000,00 €




Impressions


50,00 €





TOTAL


1480,00 €


Comme vous pouvez le voir, le plus grand montant va au loyer d'une scène où nous pouvons répéter. Nous sommes, bien entendu, aussi à la recherche des locaux qui pourraient nous être prêtés gratuitement, mais la plupart du temps, il s'agit de locaux associatifs et alternatifs qui soit demandent, eux aussi, dû à leur situation, une participation financière, soit offre une possibilité de répéter un temps court une fois par semaine par exemple. Je considère que ce ne sont pas des conditions possibles pour le travail que nous voulons délivrer, car ceci demande d'exclure des éléments théâtraux comme la lumière, le son ou la scénographie du processus de création. Le reste dans le budget montre que nous faisons du réel théâtre pauvre (Grotowski). Si jamais il devrait y avoir un surplus d'argent, celui-ci ira directement dans la création de la seconde partie du diptyque Esquisse # 2 : une ode, laquelle sera créé l'année prochaine avec une plus grande équipe. 
Que recevez-vous pour votre contribution? (Normalement, la première question dans notre système capitaliste.) En fait, il n'est pas facile d'y répondre lorsque notre produit final est du théâtre considérant qu'il s'agit d'un art techniquement non reproductible (ce qui fait, d'ailleurs, sa beauté, sa cruauté, sa force et son unicité). Bien sûr vous recevrez une invitation à une représentation si vous êtes dans le coin. Sinon, nous vous enverrons au moins une carte postale. Si vous donnez un peu plus, nous écrivons sur vous. Oui! Il ne s'agit pas d'une récompense matérialiste, mais plutôt mentale, spirituelle. Une équipe de jeunes hommes et femmes écrivent sur vous, peut-être à l'autre bout du monde, s'ils vous connaissent ou non. Si vous donnez encore un peu plus, nous vous enverrons une lettre avec ces écrits.
Si jamais vous ne pouvez donner de l'argent, mais que vous appréciez le projet que nous proposons, vous pouvez partager l'information avec vos ami(e)s et votre famille et faire passer le mot.
Si vous avez quelconques questions, nous serions heureux de vous répondre. N'hésitez surtout pas. Nous essayerons de tenir ce site à jour et y mettre un vidéo des prochaines répétitions. Les photos que vous voyez viennent de nos premiers trois jours de travail.
Merci beaucoup de votre intérêt,
M.S.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wenn ich etwas sagen kann, dann dass ich nichts sagen kann und nichts sagen will. Ich habe keine Nachricht. Ich bin weder Politiker, noch Priester, noch ein Publizist oder Werbedienst. Ich will das Theater von allen seinen Missionen befreien, und es an und für sich gelten lassen. Alles was ich habe sind Bilder, Wahrnehmungen, Texte, die mich bewegen, Musik, die mich erschüttert, Erfahrungen... Damit gehen wir auf die Bühne und konfrontieren sie mit dem notwendigen Kriterium des Theaters: Raum. Ich habe und will nicht mehr als diese Elemente, da ich den semantische Raum frei halten möchte, um aus der Konfrontation der genannten Materialien mit dem physischen Raum vollkommen unerhoffte semantische Zusammenhänge entstehen lassen zu können. Meine Absicht ist nicht beabsichtig, vorsätzlich oder absichtlich. Wenn das Theater endlich autonom werden will, sollte es auch autonom arbeiten, ohne dem Text, der Aussage, oder sonst irgendetwas Zweitrangigem etwas zu schulden. Nichts ist von vornherein gegeben, alles ist zu konstruieren! Das Resultat, könnte man mit Deleuze sagen, sind Perzepte.
Es handelt sich um eine wahrhaftige theatrale Forschungsarbeit. Diese Materialien frei, ohne a-priori, offen mit der Bühne zu konfrontieren erfordert von den Schauspielern Großzügigkeit, Geduld und Stärke in ihren künstlerischen Vorschlägen. Die Schauspieler müssen somit eine wahrhaftig kreative Arbeit leisten. Aus diesem Grund ist dieses Projekt in gewissen Maßen ein kollektives Schaffen. Ich werde keinesfalls die Position des vermuteten Wissenden einnehmen. Ich werde nicht wissen, nicht mehr und nicht weniger als jeder andere auch. Ich möchte einen Raum der Unsicherheit, des Zweifels, des Nicht-Wissens öffnen, ohne dass ich die Rolle desjenigen übernehme, der weiß. In anderen Worten, ich möchte zu einer theatralen Arbeit ohne Vorbild, Meister oder Führer gelangen, in der wir selbst und eigenständig denken, agieren und schaffen.
Die Ästhetik betreffend denke ich, dass der Naturalismus immer noch unser größter Feind ist und dies auch bleibt. Lasst uns nach Abstraktion im Theater forschen! Nach Entstellung! Nach Verwandlung! Aber lasst uns in die Arbeit mit Macht und Stärke gehen. Lasst uns über uns selbst hinaus gehen. Die Schauspieler werden sich mit Kopf und Seele in diesen unsicheren Raum werfen müssen, ihrer “Geistesgesundheit”wagend, auf der Grenze des Wahnsinns wandelnd. Jeder Vorschlag, jeder Akt auf der Bühne muss sich ohne Grenzen, ohne Kompromisse vollziehen, in der Gefahr vor allem; und nur dort werden wir die Kraft und die Macht, die wir suchen, finden können.
Ich habe keine Angst vor dem menschlichen Pathos. Einem nicht-pathetischen Pathos.
Ein kurzes Wort über mich: In Deutschland geboren, emigrierte ich für fünf Jahre nach Montreal, Kanada, wo ich anfing Psychologie zu studieren. Ich schloss meinen Bachelor in Frankreich ab. In diesem Jahr entdeckte ich das Theater und nichts weniger als den Sinn meines Lebens. Seit dem sind alle meine Entscheidungen auf das Theater und die Möglichkeit, irgendwie frei schaffen zu können, ausgerichtet. Ich bin als Schauspieler ins Theater gedrungen, aber arbeitete schnell in der Rolle des Regisseurs. Letztes Jahr inszenierte ich „Le songe ou un jeu de rêve“ („EinTraumspiel“) von August Strindberg, durchbrochen von Texten unterschiedlicher Autoren wie Dostojewski, Rilke, Lautréamont, Baudelaire u.a. Diese Arbeit erwies sich in dem Sinne als Präfiguration des jetzigen Projekts, als dass sich dort die Konzeption des Theaters als einer großen theatralen Baustelle herausgestellte hatte. (http://theatre-vitez.com/2012/05/festival-3-jours-et-plus-4/)Indem sie dieses Projekt unterstützen, helfen Sie jungen Schaffenden daran zu arbeiten, das ihnen unbedingt Notwendige realisieren zu können, und in diesem konkreten Fall verteidigen sie ein freies Theater, ein Theater, das glaubt, dass es in unserer heutigen Gesellschaft absolut notwendig ist, ein Theater, das, wenn auch nicht explizit politisch, absolut politisch ist : Eine Variation des Standartmaßes (um noch einmal mit Deleuzes Worten zu sprechen).
Dies kostet, wenn auch nicht allzu viel, eine gewisse Summe. Hier ist ein Kostenvoranschlag:








Ausgaben


 




Kostüme


150,00 €




Accessoires


150,00 €




Maske


30,00 €




Transport


100,00 €




Probebühne, Miete für 40 Tage


1000,00 €




Druckkosten


50,00 €




TOTAL


1480,00 €



Wie sie sehen können, fliesst das grösste Budget in die Miete einer Probebühne. Wir versuchen selbstverständlich auch Räume zu finden, die uns umsonst geliehen werden, doch meistens handelt es sich um Vereine, die auch knapp bei Kasse sind, oder um Räume, die wir nur für eine kurze Zeit einmal wöchentlich haben könnten. Unter diesen Bedingungen halte ich jedoch die Arbeit, die wir leisten wollen, für unmöglich. Es würde bedeuten, sämtliche theatrale Elemente wie Licht, Ton und Bühnenbild aus dem kreativen Prozess aus logistischen Gründen ausschließen zu müssen. Anhand der übrigen Kosten können Sie bemerken, dass wir ansonsten armes Theater(Grotowski) machen. Falls ein Teil des Geldes übrig bleiben sollte, wird es direkt in die Produktion des zweiten Teils des Dyptichons, Esquisse # 2: une ode, fließen. Esquisse # 2 werden wir nächstes Jahr mit einem größeren Team in Angriff nehmen.
Und was erhalten Sie für ihren finanziellen Beitrag? (Normalerweise immer die erste Frage in unserem kapitalistischen System.) Diese Frage ist gar nicht leicht zu beantworten, wenn unser „Endprodukt“ Theater, d.h. eine technisch nicht-reproduzierbare Kunstform, ist. Natürlich werden Sie eine Einladung zu einer Vorführung und freien Eintritt erhalten. Wenn Sie aber nicht in der Gegend sind, werden Sie zumindest eine Postkarte bekommen. Falls Sie ein wenig mehr geben können, werden wir über Sie schreiben. Es ist keine materielle Belohnung, aber eine geistige. Ein Team junger Männer und Frauen wird über Sie, ob bekannt oder nicht, vielleicht am anderen Ende der Welt, schreiben. Wenn Sie uns noch ein bisschen mehr unterstützen, werden wir Ihnen einen handschriftlichen Brief mit den verschiedenen Texten über Sie schicken.
Falls Sie uns nicht finanziell unterstützen können, aber unser Projekt trotzdem interessant finden, können sie diese Informationen gerne mit ihren Freundinnen und Freunden und ihrer Familie teilen.
Falls Sie irgendwelche Fragen haben sollten, zögern Sie nicht. Wir freuen uns Ihnen zu antworten. Wir werden versuchen, Sie über diese Seite auf dem Laufenden zu halten und ein Video unserer nächsten Probe hochzuladen. Die Photos, die schon zu sehen sind, stammen von unseren ersten drei Tagen Arbeit.Besten Dank für ihr Interesse,M.S.

<h2>My Story</h2>
<p>Hello, my name is Courtney Robertson and I am currently studying a BA Honours Degree in Contemporary Dance Performance at The Scottish School of Contemporary Dance.</p>
<p>In October I travelled to Groningen, The Netherlands where I performed in The Grand Theatre as part of ‘Super Special Questions’ a collaborative project. Following great success in The Netherlands I have been offered to complete the last four months of my training as an apprentice with professional dance company named Club Guy &amp; Roni who are based in Groningen.</p>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>This is an exceptionally unique opportunity for me to expand my dance experience in a professional environment and further my studies abroad. I am extremely keen to explore dance further afield and in the near future return to Scotland bringing back what I have learned. I feel this is an important step between graduating and entering the professional dance industry and know this would be an extremely valuable experience for me.</p>
<h2>What I Need</h2>
<p>Through funding I hope that my travel and living expenses will be covered helping me for fill this unique offer to the fullest. Between flights to and from the Netherlands, standard living expenses and extra dance classes/workshops I am asking for £1000 to enable me to achieve my goals.</p>
<h2>What You Get In Return</h2>
<p>If you are also passionate about dance and the integration between different cultures and dance communities your contribution will be highly valued and appreciated. You will have contributed to my oppertunity to gain many exceptional skills and experiences which will enable me to give back to the dance community in Scotland and grow and expand as a professional artist.</p>
<p>Thankyou for your time!</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hello! We are Off Off Broadzway! We were voted Runner's Up for Best Sketch Comedy Group in Chicago by the Chicago Reader's Poll. Chicago loves us, don't get us wrong. They treat us right. Sold out shows every year at the Chicago Sketch Comedy Festival, great reviews from the Chicago Tribune, Time Out Chicago, Metromix, etc... But you know who's begging for us? New Orleans! So we're headed back there this March! We are so excited to see friends we made last year and make new ones! Plus we heard Brad Pitt is going to be in town that weekend, so he'll probably want to hang out.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We love being in this group. We love performing for you. We love that you bring your friends and co-workers and you help us spread the word. We do SO many shows and still want to do more. And honestly guys, we put every last cent we make back into this group. And every year our costumes get more awesome, our props more ridiculous, our possibilities grow because of YOU and your support. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So this is the deal. We want to bring this show to as many people as possible. We went to New Orleans last year and it was a perfect fit. We are booking shows there again in March and we know from last year that it isn't going to be cheap. Round-trip airfare for the 6 of us, hotel, transportation and not to mention the rent for the Theater. That about covers it. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Here's what you get...We are now produced by Cowardly Scarecrow Theater Co, a 501(c)(3) non for profit, so any donation you make can be written off on your taxes.

Check out our list over there-------&gt;<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Indiegogo allows us to exceed our goal. SO please know that if (big IF) that happens, that's going to get the Broadz some amazingly spectacular stuff for our Spring show, like giant feather fans or....actually probably giant feather fans. They're really expensive and we've wanted them for years...<br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Can't afford it? No prob! We totally get it, but you can still help by spreading the word! We already know you're good at this, because you've gotten us this far! Tweet your little hearts out!

<li>Last but not least, with any extra we may have, we would love to give a little something back to our actors and tech staff if at all possible!</li>
</ul><p>For those of you doing math, you will notice that all those numbers add up to even more than our goal. We have a little money towards it, but we're hoping for as much as we can get.

<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>

<p>You can read scenes and go to shows and take classes but nothing gives you the confidence and the pride of doing a show, in a theatre - not a studio space or in a park, but a real theatre.

<p><strong>“INNATE” will be an hour long documentary capturing bboying, often called breakdancing, as a true art form. The film will explore what happens when bboys are taken out of competitions, staged performances, and movies. Using minimal dialogue to keep the focus on the dance, the documentary combines stunning landscapes and explosive dancing to engage the audience into what bboying has become since the 1980s.                                      </strong></p>
<p><strong>THE EVENT</strong></p>

Everyone on this project is passionate, inteligent and highly creative. Passion doesn't pay the bills.
I am lucky enough to have attracted the best talent - take a look at the bios for Director (Che'Rae Adams) and Social Media Outreach Consultant (Cindy Marie Jenkins*). Amazing - right?

<p>Hello! My name is Cristal Gonzalez, author and performer of the one-woman show, LA SOMBRA. Born and raised in the <em>campesino</em> town of Watsonville, CA. <em>Mi voz es campesina</em> (A farmworker’s voice), <em>hija de una madre soltera</em> (daughter of a single mother) <em>y escribo del corazon</em> (I write from the heart.) I’ve been doing theater since I was a child, continued by passion for <em>teatro</em> at San Jose State University where I obtained a B.A in Theater Arts. SJSU awarded me with the Reed Award for Excellence in Acting and 1<sup>st</sup>place in Oral Interpretation (2010). Shortly after graduating I continued to exercise and develop my skills as a performer with El Teatro Campesino, for over a year. In March 2012 ETC gave a home to LA SOMBRA in a successful weekend production.</p>
<p><strong>LA SOMBRA:</strong></p>
<p>LA SOMBRA is a play that deals with the issue that many women face, domestic violence. This play invites you to explore all the <em>sombras</em> (shadows) that outline your own reflection. It focuses on a young couple Celi and Army- a relationship whose love is lingering on a breath of hope:<strong> <em>la necia esperanza, que mañana, el cambiara</em>.</strong> Celi must confront her past and present shadows to find her own <em>sombra </em>(shadow).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Cuando me perdi en ti-      / When did I lose myself in you-</em></p>
<p><em>Dejando ni un rostro de lo que yo fui? / Leaving no trace of who i used to be.</em></p>
<p><em>Cuando te di tanto poder sobre mi? / When did I give you so much control over me?</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>¿Por que hablar, si es mucho mas fácil callar ? Why speak, if it’s easier to remain silent?</strong></p>
<p> As a young writer and performer I continue to seek opportunities to share our stories on-stage. All stories, especially the ones we’ve kept quiet for years, the stories that live within our skins, the stories that need a witness in order to heal, the stories we are told MUST not be talked about, <em><strong>“de esas cosas no se habla.</strong>” Pero es precisamente esas historias que nos causan dolor, son de esas historias que tenemos que aprender a hablar. </em>La Sombra deals with <strong>domestic violence</strong> a universal theme that cross-culturally has been kept in shadows. Why do we stay? Why are we silent?  Why did I stay? Why was I loyal to him but not myself? This play is an invitation for dialog to begin. <strong>If we don’t share our stories then we stand alone in our experiences.</strong></p>

Every performance begins with a blank canvas on the performance space. Throughout the piece the dancers will paint using different parts of their bodies, thus, marking the canvas. The movements are set and choreographed, but the artwork created is different every time. Each performance will display the final canvas and a canvas of performances prior, allowing the audience to observe the similarities, differences, irregularities and subtleties of live performance. This piece is a big endeavor, the biggest each has ever been a part of.

</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
<b>The
Cambrians [KAYM-bree-uns]</b> is
a brand new, Chicago-headquartered dance production and media
company. The Chicago Tribune called our first undertaking, <b>The Nexus
Project</b>, ""hard to describe, but easy to watch"", and we love
that. We use large collaborative processes that coordinate the very
best performers with numerous choreographers from many different
communities. These processes create genre-bending, interdisciplinary
performances which challenge the notion that progressive art can't be
accessible. We strive to make sure that as many voices as possible
have an influence in the art we put on stage. Working with artists
from many perspectives allows us to build art rooted in the human
experiences that connect us all.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Contributions to this campaign go directly to the building of <b>The Cambrians’ Theater in a Box</b>. The <b>Theater in a Box </b>is a community resource that consists of a 1,296 sq ft collapsible sprung floor, an excellent sound system and an 18-fixture LED lighting rig. We'll be able to set this theater up in neighborhood venues throughout Chicago and beyond for performances.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">When we're not using our equipment, we'll be renting it (at maintenance-level prices) to dance and theatre peers throughout the Chicagoland area. This sort of equipment is normally reserved for high-budget companies and corporate events–as such the current rental rates are far beyond the reach of most small-scale performing arts companies. We don't think dancers should need a multi-million dollar budget to dance on a floor that protects their bodies. We don't think small dance and theater companies should have to pay the same rental rates as massive pop and Broadway shows to use high-capacity technologies like LED lighting.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We've secured some funding toward realizing the<b> Theater in a Box </b>already. It's central to our philosophy that our resources are sharable whenever possible. This campaign supports the final $10,000 we need to see it through to the end.</p>

<h1>Why a Freaking Theater In a Box?</h1>
<h3><br/></h3>
</div>
<p>
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
Good
question! <b>The
Cambrians</b> 
perform extended runs of four weeks or more in non-traditional spaces
(think auto garage) for small audiences of 50-100 people. Renting
stage equipment two or three times a year for a month or more at a
time gets expensive in a hurry. In other words, over the next two
years, the cost to rent equipment for our shows would be <b>significantly
higher</b>
than the cost of building and purchasing our <b>Theater in a Box</b>, which contains
equipment that's better than what we could afford to rent. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">  <br/>Also, the
fact of the matter is that many dance artists in Chicago often
struggle to meet their basic production needs–a good floor, sound,
and light. The <b>Theater in a Box</b> is our creative solution to this
problem: a sensible sharing of resources to help the Chicago dance
and performing arts community we love execute its creativity to the
fullest.</p>

</div></div>","Who We Are





The
Cambrians [KAYM-bree-uns] is
a brand new, Chicago-headquartered dance production and media
company. The Chicago Tribune called our first undertaking, The Nexus
Project, ""hard to describe, but easy to watch"", and we love
that. We use large collaborative processes that coordinate the very
best performers with numerous choreographers from many different
communities. These processes create genre-bending, interdisciplinary
performances which challenge the notion that progressive art can't be
accessible. We strive to make sure that as many voices as possible
have an influence in the art we put on stage. Working with artists
from many perspectives allows us to build art rooted in the human
experiences that connect us all.
Visit our website WWW.THECAMBRIANS.COM to get to know us in depth!







  What You're Helping Us Create


Contributions to this campaign go directly to the building of The Cambrians’ Theater in a Box. The Theater in a Box is a community resource that consists of a 1,296 sq ft collapsible sprung floor, an excellent sound system and an 18-fixture LED lighting rig. We'll be able to set this theater up in neighborhood venues throughout Chicago and beyond for performances.  
When we're not using our equipment, we'll be renting it (at maintenance-level prices) to dance and theatre peers throughout the Chicagoland area. This sort of equipment is normally reserved for high-budget companies and corporate events–as such the current rental rates are far beyond the reach of most small-scale performing arts companies. We don't think dancers should need a multi-million dollar budget to dance on a floor that protects their bodies. We don't think small dance and theater companies should have to pay the same rental rates as massive pop and Broadway shows to use high-capacity technologies like LED lighting.
We've secured some funding toward realizing the Theater in a Box already. It's central to our philosophy that our resources are sharable whenever possible. This campaign supports the final $10,000 we need to see it through to the end.










Why a Freaking Theater In a Box?





Good
question! The
Cambrians 
perform extended runs of four weeks or more in non-traditional spaces
(think auto garage) for small audiences of 50-100 people. Renting
stage equipment two or three times a year for a month or more at a
time gets expensive in a hurry. In other words, over the next two
years, the cost to rent equipment for our shows would be significantly
higher
than the cost of building and purchasing our Theater in a Box, which contains
equipment that's better than what we could afford to rent. 
  Also, the
fact of the matter is that many dance artists in Chicago often
struggle to meet their basic production needs–a good floor, sound,
and light. The Theater in a Box is our creative solution to this
problem: a sensible sharing of resources to help the Chicago dance
and performing arts community we love execute its creativity to the
fullest.

While spaces catering to mainly cis-gay men operate on a regular basis, spaces for other queer people exist in more marginal forms, appearing in monthly and ad-hoc events. These spaces continue to be where young people escape to navigate their position within queer identity in Singapore. Here, the nightclub is a messy utopia, where desire plays out and identity is continually constructed. Much of its dynamics remain offline as protection for the community; bringing these gestures into a performance space safely visibilises these lived experiences.<br/> <br/>The source material was generated through time spent documenting these spaces, as well as Charmaine’s ethnographic series, How They Love, which features interviews with people in the queer community, as well as photographs lensing the way queer desire is performed for the camera.

<h3>Who We Are </h3>
<p>Marc Blanchard and Scott Kuipers are two Toronto based creators.</p>
<p>​Marc is from London, Ontario and Scott is from Prince Edward County. They met and completed their training together at the Ryerson University Theatre School.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Every live performance carries with it inevitable risks and challenges. Here are some situations we could run into: </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Dear Contributor,</p>
<p>We are a small dance shoe maker and supply dance shoes to people and communities mainly on a national basis at present. We have been in operation for only a few years but have seen the demand for dance shoes grow quite quickly as the dance phenomenon takes off around the world.</p>
<p>So far we have been supplying to the average higher end of the socio-economic spectrum, which is where the bulk of people who dance are sourced from. However, due to the high cost of dancing and learning to dance, it is quite prohibitive to the lower end of the socio-economic range and the poor and disadvantaged and they never end up being able to experience the health, social, self-esteem, and other benefits that are derived from this popular pasttime.</p>
<p>Our dream now is to bring dancing to this lower end of the spectrum and allow these people to finally participate in this great craze. The benefits it will bring will be immeasurable.</p>
<p>The only way we can achieve this goal is to ask everyday folk such as yourself to help with a contribution to get this project off the ground. We aim to have at least 10,000-20,000 new dancers around the underpriveleged world by the end of 2012, with many many more within the coming years (500,000 or more people). In order to do this we will need a fair amount of working capital (i.e. money), so we ask you to contribute what you can and hopefully we can raise an amount that can help us bring this dream to reality! Please help!</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Get in contact with us and let us know if you are able to help us spread this dream by letting us know of the local communities, people, or groups who we would be able to get involved in the dance craze who currently would not be able to due to being from a low socio-economic group, are disadvantaged, or otherwise unable to participate due to the high cost or lack of facilities in their area.</p>

<p>Hello, my name is Sky Van Vliet.  I am a young dancer and aerialist, as well as an actress and model.  But mostly, I love to perform!  And I have been performing for most of my life!</p>
<p>As an aerialist, I have been very fortunate to be able to use an aerial rig owned by a friend.  But it now seems that the rig will no longer be available for me to use.  While my parents have been amazing supporters of all of my passions for the performing arts, they are just barely able to pay for my dance tuition every month.  So $3,500 for an aerial rig, cable ladder and new crash mat is just not in the budget since my dad is the only one working right now.  </p>
<p>By having my own aerial rig, I can perform at more events and be able to help cover the cost of tuition for the 9 weekly dance classes I currently take. And I would be able to perform at more charity events that are close to my heart because I would own my own equipment and would not be dependent on someone else's schedule.  I would also be able to teach aerial classes!</p>
<p>If my campaign gets funded, I will use the equipment to inspire and do good things.  I WILL PAY IT FORWARD!  I have been so lucky to have the opportunity to train and perform.  I just want to have the tools that will allow me to keep on doing what I am so passionate about!  Peace , Love and Aerial Dance!</p>

<h3><strong>Who are we?</strong></h3>
<p>The Brigata is a<span> company of actors, designers, and writers who stage readings and productions of their own plays. Last year, <em>T</em><span><em>he Violence of My Affection</em> performed at Chicago's A Red Orchid Theatre. This year, we're bringing this poetic and beautiful play to New York City!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>What are we doing this time?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>On January 11 and 12, we'll stage readings of the new draft of <em>The Violence of My Affection</em>, an original play by</span></span> Gaetano Marangelli, at The Tank, a non-profit theater in Midtown Manhattan. On January 13, we'll present previews of <em>The Violence of My Affection</em> and new plays by Gaetano Marangelli and Marta Mondelli. </p>
<p><strong>Why is this important to us?</strong></p>
<p><span>The staged readings and preview of <span><em><em>The Violence of My Affection</em></em></span> serve as the foundation for our production of the play this year. </span>As a new company, we want to find new audiences for our work, and presenting these performances at The Tank during t<span>he Association of Performing Arts Presenters Conference in New York on January 11, 12, and 13 offers us a wonderful opportunity to do that.<br/></span></p>
<p><strong>What is this play about?</strong></p>
<p><em>The Violence of My Affection</em> is the story of an Italian actress whose love of language binds, then severs her marriage to an American scholar. When their son, a journalist, tells her of her husband’s sudden death, she refuses to believe him—until she reveals to him the cause of her husband’s demise.</p>
<p>The play’s principal character, Sofonisba Bellini, evokes the power of Greek heroines. Her evolving stages of English diction mark both the ascent of her power and her descent into sorrow and anguish. ""Marangelli's principal character is not your typical victim of pain and suffering,” wrote Chicago Stage Style of the premiere production, “who doesn’t know how to feel sympathy for the world that rejected her. Her inner mental workings create a magical play."" </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What do we need?</h3>
<p>The Tank has given us its stage for our performances, but we still need to cover our stage rent expenses for rehearsals, the cost of props and costumes for our previews, and--most importantly--stipends for our designers and actors!</p>

<h2>About our Director and our Project</h2>
<p>My name is Barbara Brandt and I am the Founder and Artistic Director of Direction Dance Ensemble.  I am a dancer, choreographer, classically trained actor and musician.  DDE is my way of using the gifts I have to try to make the world around me a better place.  It is something I'm intensely passionate about - each of us has a responsibility to society, to speak to the issues of the day and to make a positive impact on the world around us.  I try to use my art to do that.  The majority of the works that DDE produces deal with topical issues.  </p>
<p>We are raising funds at this time to support our upcoming joint performance with Repertory Ballet of New York.  The pieces we are creating for this performance address a wide variety of issues: the joys of being a woman, the universal effect that war has on the individuals and their relationships (on both sides), and the struggle that a young gay man has to accept himself.  </p>
<p>Your contributions will help us to pay the dancers, to rent rehearsal space, to build costumes and to pay musicians who are composing the original music we use.  Your dollars are immensely important to our work - without them we cannot continue to grow.  DDE plans to build on its performance base into a company that uses dance as a teaching and healing enterprise.  None of this is possible without the generous support of our sponsors.</p>

Stories of
Substance” uses drama, humor and music in a creative, powerful, and
efficient way to educate students about making healthy choices. It raises
awareness about vital information, and a strong connection is forged with the
emotions behind substance use, domestic violence, sexual conduct, bullying, self-esteem, depression, and internet safety. 

The
performance is written and performed by young adults and is developed from
actual stories. The cast - peer educators, take
the real stories and develop an interactive and engaging performance.  The
audience can feel and learn. Some of the actors have experienced the scenes
they are portraying. The cast share their experience through the scenes as well
as in the talk back discussion after each performance, reaching their peers in
a very powerful way.


The Impact
Stories of substance (SOS) is all about real stories, real people. Using theatre as an educational
tool is not a new concept, but we take it a step further by combining three
powerful tools:  theatre, peer education
and real stories. Theatre is chosen as a medium for learning because it allows
an audience to respond on a “feeling” level. We want our audience to
""feel"" the information before they think ""that will not happen
to me'. 

Many times, students come up to the cast after shows to relate to a scene they saw on stage, or share with us their own, personal story. Other times, they will reach out to us online. Whichever way they do, our goal is to help them, ""stop and think"" about the choices they have made and continue to make.

<h3>Short summary</h3>
<p>Hello there!</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I am an actress and author currently working on a site-specific piece that will be performed at 'On the Verge', a Festival for emerging artists happening in Liverpool in October. </span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">After training and working as an actress in France and Italy, I got into the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland (formerly RSAMD) where I had the amazing opportunity to perform at the Globe and in Beijing.</span></p>

I would like to continue raising awareness about it and I am currently researching and developing a new piece of work that involves site-specific and physical theatre.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>What I need</h3>
<p>Whatever amount is raised, it will be a huge help towards:</p>
<p>1) Buying the props and costumes needed for the piece. And also a few umbrellas for the audience members if it happens to rain...</p>
<p>2) Paying the very important people who are involved in making this challenging and ambitious piece of work, including the writer/director, the performers and the editor of the sound. </p>
<p>3) Marketing the show by designing and printing flyers, posters, as well as a fancy programme to guide the audience members through the piece.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I hope this piece makes people question the notion of beauty in our society, the influence of the media, including magazines and social media, that constantly make us feel inadequate by feeding our insecurities. Most importantly, I hope it creates a dialogue about something that is secret, taboo, because of the shame involved and that it encourages those who are affected by eating disorders, or know someone who might be, to seek advice and help.</p>

Hello there!
I am an actress and author currently working on a site-specific piece that will be performed at 'On the Verge', a Festival for emerging artists happening in Liverpool in October. 
After training and working as an actress in France and Italy, I got into the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland (formerly RSAMD) where I had the amazing opportunity to perform at the Globe and in Beijing.
While I was there, I also directed my first devised movement based piece entitled Watch me Disappear performed in a ladies’ bathroom at the Arches in Glasgow, that touched on the issue of eating disorders and body image.

<h3>The Scoop</h3>
<p><i>The North Plan</i> is Street Corner Arts' return to the fast-paced, politically-charged world of Jason Wells, writer of their 2011 hit, <i>Men of Tortuga</i>.  This pitch-black comedy will have its regional premiere at Hyde Park Theatre (511 W. 43rd St.) in Austin, Texas from December 6 to December 21, 2013. Check out the ""Gallery"" for our show poster and (soon) bios and pics of the cast!<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>The North Plan</i> tells the story of Carlton
Berg, a bureaucrat for the U.S. State Department, who runs off with the top secret
enemies list of a ruthless faction that has seized power in Washington creating a state of martial law.  Unfortunately for Carlton, the chase has come to an end in
a police station in the Ozarks town of Lodus, Missouri. With a pair of Department of Homeland Security agents on the way, Carlton's last hope arrives in the form of fellow prisoner Tanya
Shepke, a motor-mouthed redneck who's turned herself in for drunk driving and has a penchant for raising hell.<br/><br/><span>The

<h3><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></h3>For this campaign, we are raising $4000 of our $8000 budget.  Here's what each giving benchmark purchases:</span><p></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>$500: the royalties for the show</li>
<li>$1250: royalties and one week of theatre rental</li>
<li>$2000: royalties and two weeks of theatre rental</li>
<li>$2750: royalties and entire production theatre rental</li>
<li>$3500: royalties, theatre rental &amp; material costs for the set, lights and sound</li>
<li>$4000: royalties, theatre rental, material costs for the set, lights and sound &amp; rehearsal space rental</li>
</ul>Any funds above the designated goal will go towards the actors and designers first and foremost and, then, towards covering the rest of the production costs (marketing materials, concessions, etc.)<p></p>
<p>Street Corner Arts believes VERY STRONGLY in paying the actors and designers that kindly give of their time and energy while, oftentimes, working a second and, sometimes, even a third job.  We hire many of the most-talented professional actors and designers in the Austin area.  Your contributions will continue to make that possible.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Additionally, your gifts will entitle you to a number of perks depending upon your giving level.  Donors can receive tickets to <i>The North Plan</i> and even the opportunity for a pre-show cocktail party for the donor and a group of friends.  Make sure that you check out all of the different perks listed on the right.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>The Impact</b></h3>Unfortunately, the ticket price to our productions covers only about 30-40% of the cost of the show.  To rephrase that, theatre is a pricey endeavor.  We know that.  But we feel that it is well worth the cost.  The feedback that we have received from our 3 previously produced plays has been phenomenal.  Long after the lights have gone down on the stage, our audience members have continued to discuss the ideas and the themes of the plays---in the lobby with the cast and crew, on social media, even through emails and phone calls.  That is what is so exciting about live theatre.  The immediacy and the intimacy.  We are so grateful for your continued support and, by funding this project, you will allow the conversation to continue.<p></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The All Stories Theater Company based in Massachusetts is an informal association of artists dedicated to bringing a diverse array of compelling, exciting theater to audiences in the Boston/Providence area - and beyond.</p>
<p>We're founded on some key ideas. One is that life is short, so don't wait around to do your art - get out there and do it!  Another is: if you're calling yourself an artist, you have a responsibility to actively contribute as one- so get out there and do it! Yet another is:  if you believe theater would benefit from this or that change --- on stage,  behind the scenes or  even in the audiences, don't just say things need to change - get out there and do it!</p>
<p>We believe in being proactive, in having high standards and high ideals, in a variety of voices, in community interaction.  Most of all, we believe in the indispensible value of stories.</p>
<p>....Yeah, we know everyone says that, but, for real, we totally do.</p>
<p>And, so, on August 10th and 11th, in a program of one act plays called ""All Stories Are True,""  our company is going to bring in a gigantic amalgam of stories to the stage of Blackburn Hall in Walpole MA. And we're going to tell the living heck out of them.</p>
<p><br/>Will you help us do this?</p>
<p>We are looking for some financial backing to help defray the cost of our venue, marketing, and other details. We also believe in paying artists - even just a little - and aim to give our writers, directors, and actors -- most of whom are professionals - a tiny thank you stipend for their hard work.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have two major expenses: place and people. We can't do a show without both, so we think this is money well spent.</p>
Our venue rental for the two nights will be a total of $500. Which is rather amazing....</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We have we have seven writers to supply with a  stipend. And then there are the directors and actors, too. You know- Holly, Mark, Judith, Leeanna, Erin, Liz, Alex, Kyp, Kadian, Libby, Richie, Kristin, Mai, Sarah, Ann Marie, Chanelle, Stasia, and maybe another one or two. And perhaps a cat or a small reptile. Does anyone have a turtle? We would put about $300 into this piece of our budget....the artists, not the turtle...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Additional costs: printing of scripts and marketing materials, rental of basic equipment as needed (like room dividers, props, sound, etc.) will round out the last $200.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As you can see from our perks list, we're are offering our backers not only a chance to help with this program, but a place in our new company's  community. We don't just want your money: we want YOU. And our perks aim to lure you in. Bwahahaha.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Plus, you know, we do want your money.</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
If you back us, you're backing the idea that artists shouldn't wait around to be artists. You're saying you believe in taking chances, being proactive, risking failure, that whole ""be the change you want to see""  thing. You're backing one more shoestring company that wants to join its voice with the voices of all the other shoestring companies that make up the backbone of the world of theater. You're backing the beginning-- the beginning of our story. And you're making yourself part of it.</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
Spread the word with social media. You have friends and followers we don't know. Reach them for us.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>There are also tools on indiegogo that you can use to communicate with others about our campaign if you're a member of this fine site</div>

I've written and directed ten minute plays on the community theater level, and guest directed a one act play at the College of Southern Nevada. I also wrote the award winning play, <em>When Mom Died on Saturn</em>, produced by the Las Vegas Little Theater, and co-created the late night sketch comedy show, <em>MOTHER FUPPETS</em>.</p>
<p>Now, I have the opportunity bring my art to life, and I need your help!</p>
<p><strong>This is how we will make a difference...</strong></p>
<p><em>Romeo and Juliet - Queen Mab's Tale</em> has never been done before. Ever. It's a brand new fresh take on the classic tragedy. I have added Queen Mab, a dream witch made famous from Mecutio's much debated dream monologue, into a character in the production that gallops through Romeo and Juliet's head spinning them into a web of dreams and deja vu, while being accompanied by a team of atomi, or dancers, who make up the set, the magic, and the very being of Queen Mab herself.</p>
<p>I want to excite the young people with art, and entertain the old with a twist. Start a new conversation! Create a trend! I can see this thing in my head, and I can't wait to show the world this crazy beautiful dream-like adaptation.</p>
<p><strong>This is what we need to pay for...</strong></p>
<p>Right now my bases are loaded with actors and technical designers who aren't just talented, but are some of the most passionate people I've ever known. They deserve the best:</p>
<p>costumes and props</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The People's Puppets of Occupy Wall Street is a collective of puppeteers and artists from many disciplines who pool their inspiration, energy and resources to spread Occupy Wall Street's core message of economic and social justice. Using art's unique power to envision other worlds and explore sustainable alternatives, The People's Puppets have created hundreds of puppets for Occupy gatherings and in solidarity with allied organizations, community groups, and unions since October 2011. </p>
<p>Jack and the Corporate Beanstalk is our latest outreach attempt to educate and excite the 99% about taking back power from the 1%.  A workshop version was performed  at the Greenpoint Theatre Festival &amp; the full length version wil premiere at The NYC International Fringe Festival during August as well as at Bread and Puppet Theater in Septemebr, and many street corners throughout New York City.</p>
<p><br class=""Apple-interchange-newline""/><em>Summary: </em><span>Out of work Jack goes to college to get some magic beans and grow a beanstalk to visit the Giant Job Creator in the sky -but once Jack is saddled with debt they're still at the mercy of the Corporate Giant! In this puppet music spectacle, the audience has to get involved and help Jack take back the Golden Goose for the 99%!</span></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The $1000 covers rent for the several months we've been working on this project, materials and building supplies for the puppets and set pieces, and storage space and transportation of large puppets and set pieces.  We have maintained a multi-use art space for the last 10 months opening our doors to hundreds of artists, activists, and other members of the community.  Any money we raise beyond our goal will help us keep the doors open to our art studio that much longer. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We live in a time where economic injustice and its social and environmental impact have reached a point where we have no choice but to reorganize ourselves around new principles of transparency, horizontalism, and mutual aid.  We hope this show will help spread that message, and encourage more citizens to become actively engaged in discussing the many problems facing our society, and being part of the soliutions to these problems.</p>
<p>To this end, we have invited members of community organizations and Occupy groups to be in the final song of our performance so that the audience can talk more with people from groups like: Center for Progrssive Economics, the IWW, Alternative Banking Working Group, and others.</p>
<h3>Performances</h3>

<strong>This fundraiser is to help with three things</strong>:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Venue hire</strong> – we’ve got a great space at C Venues, one of the largest hubs of theatre and new writing at the Edinburgh Fringe. But being in such a great space requires a little bit of money.</li>
<li>
<strong>Publicity</strong> – we’ve got a great show, with a great hook. Fans of anything or everything will love this show, but we need to tell people about it. We need posters and postcards. Flyers and programmes.</li>
<li>
<strong>Costumes</strong> – we have a couple of particular costumes that we need to get <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">absolutely right</span>. If you’ve ever been to a Convention, you know how good the costumes are. In particular, our main character is dressed as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Doctor"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the Fifth Doctor</a> throughout the show. We want to get that costume as close to perfect as possible. The shows hinges on this costume being as close to perfect as possible. Plus, there's a costume that appears in the final scene that also needs that attention to detail, but... spoilers!</li>
</ol><p>And that’s it. We’re going to Edinburgh – and we want to make the show as amazing as we can. Because the better the show is in Edinburgh – it’s a World Premiere – the more opportunity we’ll get to tour the show.</p>
<p>Star Jennifer Lusk will be back in Australia in 2014, and plans are afoot for the Melbourne and Adelaide Fringe festivals – but <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">if we raise over and above our goal</span>, a few more dates in London and the UK over the next twelve months is entirely possible. And it will help Binkaboo Productions get a running start on those Aussie festivals in the next couple of years.</p>
<p>So, if you can't be or won't be in Edinburgh, your donation will help make sure we can bring the show to you.</p>
<p>Check out the rewards we have for you - messages from Edinburgh, signed posters, an annotated version of the script with commentary from the entire team, free tickets for Edinburgh (and 2-for-1 specials when we tour near you). Any generosity will be much appreciated and rewarded as best we can - including our eternal gratitude.</p>

<p><i>Meet
 <b>Vincent DiDonato </b>(<i>Lou Martini, Jr.</i>), the single, lonely and reluctant new owner of <b>CENTENNIAL CASTING</b>, a metal-casting shop in downtown New York City. <i> The business was started by Vincent's mother and now, after her unexpected death, it is his.</i> <br/></i></p>
<p><i>While cleaning out his mother's office, he stumbles across a stack of 
head-shots from eager actors submitting photos for what they mistakenly 
assume is an “entertainment-casting” office.  Struck by the photo of one
 down-on-her-luck actress, <b>Edie Keaton</b> (<i>Alicia Harding</i>), Vincent is convinced by his best
 friend and foreman <b>Doo Doo </b>(<i>Anthony Patellis</i>)<b></b>, to pretend to be a casting director in 
order to meet the young lady. <br/></i></p>
<p><i>The metal-shop is converted into a 
professional casting office, Edie arrives for an “interview” and sparks 
fly as Vincent begins living a hilarious double life of show business 
and sheet metal, only to realize that this elaborate ruse is 
jeopardizing any chance of truly winning Edie’s love. Waist-deep in 
deception, Vincent struggles to find a way to reveal the truth to Edie 
without losing her forever. A heart-warming, hilarious romantic comedy,

 Vincent DiDonato (Lou Martini, Jr.), the single, lonely and reluctant new owner of CENTENNIAL CASTING, a metal-casting shop in downtown New York City.  The business was started by Vincent's mother and now, after her unexpected death, it is his. 
While cleaning out his mother's office, he stumbles across a stack of 
head-shots from eager actors submitting photos for what they mistakenly 
assume is an “entertainment-casting” office.  Struck by the photo of one
 down-on-her-luck actress, Edie Keaton (Alicia Harding), Vincent is convinced by his best
 friend and foreman Doo Doo (Anthony Patellis), to pretend to be a casting director in 
order to meet the young lady. 
The metal-shop is converted into a 
professional casting office, Edie arrives for an “interview” and sparks 
fly as Vincent begins living a hilarious double life of show business 
and sheet metal, only to realize that this elaborate ruse is 
jeopardizing any chance of truly winning Edie’s love. Waist-deep in 
deception, Vincent struggles to find a way to reveal the truth to Edie 
without losing her forever. A heart-warming, hilarious romantic comedy, 
filled with twists and turns, catharsis and cannolis, this is the story 
of two ordinary people in an extraordinary situation who find dreams can
 come true, at CENTENNIAL CASTING.

With your support we want to take our show to the Edinburgh fringe this August. Although we have been able to create the show itself with no funds we have had to find as many creative ways to help pay for our trip as possible. We have taken a business course on the side of our studies to win funding and we pitched our idea to a room of corporate business students in the form of an accapella song to help pay for initial venue costs.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Village Playwrights was founded over 30 years ago and is New York City's longest standing LGBTQ play writing group.  It was founded to create a place where LGBTQ playwrights could have their plays read in a supportive environment.   The group meets to read plays the second and fourth Wednesday of the month at the LGBT Community Center in New York's West Village. There is no charge to the playwrights.  In 2014 the Gay Holiday Short Play Reading Festival was started.  The Village Playwrights Intensive Play Writing, a 12 hour course that teaches play structure, was offered in 2016.  And we have produced group productions of our writers' short plays.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Because we don't charge the playwrights to have their plays read, we rely on donations to cover our costs.  The LGBT Community Center has recently doubled our rental fee.  In the past we were able to cover our costs from the optional donations given by playwrights attending our meetings.  We now find, with the rising rent, we will need to seek additional funds.  $500 will pay for 2 months of meetings at the LGBT Community Center.</p>

<p>New York City used to be the place to learn the craft of play writing.  But the cost of space is challenging the ability of playwrights to produce and develop their works.  This is unfortunate because the city offers a large and vibrant audience base that playswrights need to develop their works.  Your donation, no matter how small, will help the Village Playwrights continue serving New York City playwrights.</p>
<ul></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>One of the biggest challenges of doing theater is finding an audience.  We have an advantage of being the only LGBTQ playwriting group in New York City and have the potential of drawing a large audience to our events.  To achieve this, however, we need to improve our visibility.  It is our hope that this IndieGoGo campaign will help not only to raise money but also let people know how we serve the LGBTQ community.  </p>
<ul></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Help us by being an audience member at our bimonthly meetings, 8 pm the second and fourth Wednesday of the month at the LGBT Community Center, 208 W. 13th St., NYC.  It's a great way to see professional actors in plays that are relevant to modern LGBTQ audiences.</p>
</div></div>","Short Summary
The Village Playwrights was founded over 30 years ago and is New York City's longest standing LGBTQ play writing group.  It was founded to create a place where LGBTQ playwrights could have their plays read in a supportive environment.   The group meets to read plays the second and fourth Wednesday of the month at the LGBT Community Center in New York's West Village. There is no charge to the playwrights.  In 2014 the Gay Holiday Short Play Reading Festival was started.  The Village Playwrights Intensive Play Writing, a 12 hour course that teaches play structure, was offered in 2016.  And we have produced group productions of our writers' short plays.

What We Need & What You Get
Because we don't charge the playwrights to have their plays read, we rely on donations to cover our costs.  The LGBT Community Center has recently doubled our rental fee.  In the past we were able to cover our costs from the optional donations given by playwrights attending our meetings.  We now find, with the rising rent, we will need to seek additional funds.  $500 will pay for 2 months of meetings at the LGBT Community Center.

<h3>We are Canterbury Shakespeare Festival...</h3>
<p>We are an up-and-coming alfresco theatre experience that is dedicated to bringing the Canterbury and Kent communities together in a mutual love and celebration of the Bard and his works. We are comprised of a permanent committee of eight enthusiastic executives, with a raft of experience in theatre production, theatre education and performing and visual arts design. In their own way; each acts as a facilitator, to the army of volunteer actors, directors and other production team members that make up the rest of the Festival.</p>
<p>This year marks the second time that CSF will bring the Bard to Canterbury. With its continuation, the number of shows the Festival is producing has doubled, seeing adaptations of <i>As You Like It</i>, <i>Macbeth</i>, <i>The Merchant of Venice</i> and <i>Twelfth Night</i> being brought to some of the city's most picturesque green spaces this summer. In addition, CSF has begun to offer workshops and other outreach opportunities to schools in the local area, in order to help engage young people with one of theatre's greatest talents and the art in general.</p>
<p>Canterbury Shakespeare Festival does not function without the support of the public. The bitter irony is that in order to provide the best possible experience to our community - both the volunteers who make the Festival happen and the audiences who come to enjoy it - we must ask for funding and donations from it. However, these contributions help us to costume our actors; provide set and props to our directors; hire exciting and immersive venues; continue our work engaging young people year-round, and spread the word of the Festival to as many people as possible, growing our community and bringing it together.</p>
</div><div>
<p>The £1000 for which we are asking this year will take us the last step of the way toward making 2016's Festival truly great! Although many of our initial outlays have been covered, such as venue hire and insurance costs; there are a number of small expenses that the money from this campaign will ensure aren't bank-breaking:</p>
<ul>
<li>Costuming can always been improved, and small, characterful accessories and highlights often make great last-minute additions.</li>
<li>The production of CSF merchandise would provide stylish (just look at our fantastic artwork and imagery!) and often practical mementos of the occasion, being offered in the first instance to our backers as rewards.</li>
<li>The Great British weather can often provide some challenges to producing an outdoor theatre festival. This money could provide some effective solutions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another way in which CSF could benefit from these funds, would be to use them to hold its first end-of-festival gala: a celebration of what we're confident will be another highly successful Festival, to which representatives from the press; notable local arts patrons, and some other members of the public would be invited. Such an event would cement our relationships with a number of our supporters and really help establish our intent to keep growing and improving.</p>
<p>As ever, any funds raised beyond the cost of the Festival will be reinvested into next year's effort. In this way, its quality will only continue to improve.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We at CSF realise that not everybody is able to contribute financially, but there are still plenty of ways that you can help us out, even if that is so:</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>A descendant of a slave, Al Arnold, tells his journey of embracing his Confederate heritage. His ancestor, Turner Hall, Jr., a Black Confederate, served as a body servant for two Confederate soldiers and an orderly for General Robert E. Lee. Hall's life's journey eventually led him to Hugo, Oklahoma where he established himself as the town's most distinguished citizen receiving acclaim from Black and White citizens alike for his service. In 1938, his journey continued to Pennsylvania as the last Civil War veteran from his community to attend the final Civil War veteran reunion, as a Black Confederate. He also traveled to New York City and was interviewed by the national talk radio show, ""We, The People"" in 1940.  This Stage Play highlights Hall's Journey through the discovery of an amazing African American Confederate discovery presented to us by Hall's great-great grandson, Al Arnold,  in his book, ""Robert E. Lee's Orderly A Modern Black Man's Confederate Journey.  Al tells the story of Turner Hall, Jr., his personal Confederate journey and how family and faith has brought harmony to his new found heritage. Arnold argues for the revitalization of the lost Black history of the Civil War era. He bestows dignity and honor on his Confederate ancestor and challenges the traditional thoughts of modern African Americans. Arnold rests in his faith as the uniting force that reconciles our colorful past to our bright future. This play is the journey of a unique genealogy discovery and how one African American man came to understand his Confederate heritage in the South during a time of racial unrest.</p>

A dream that told the story of two kids that climbed a mountain to meet the big and magical tree of wishes. This curious tree has the power to grant wishes for whoever is able to get to it. Clarita and Pancho are two kids that want to overcome their very particular disabilities through the wishes they expect will come true.This show talks about how we can communicate through means we thought were impossible and how “disabilities” will never be an obstacle to fulfill our dreams.Clarita and Pancho is a totally original musical story that will tell the adventures of these two kids accompanied by three luminous story tellers that will sing and dance in rhythms of the 60’s; the era of teased hairstyles, Motown and clothes that irradiated colors. All of this will be shown in the best style of Broadway in a musical that will surely entertain every member of the family, not just children.Creative sheet:

Why are we looking for help?Financing a play, let alone a musical, has become an incredibly difficult task in our country, in our current times. Production costs go from great costumes and ambitious scenography to the composition of original music created specifically for the play. Plus, the work of our creative team is incredibly valuable and we really want to pay them the way they deserve to be paid.This is why we ask for your collaboration. Every help we can get will be appreciated and you will be helping us build the culture of our country.

Un sueño que contó la historia de dos niños que subieron una montaña para encontrarse en la cima con el mágico y grande Árbol de los Deseos. Este curioso Árbol tiene el poder de cumplir un deseo a todo aquel que logra llegar a él. Clarita y Pancho son dos niños que quieren superar discapacidades muy particulares a través de deseos que esperan cumplir.Este es un espectáculo que habla de cómo podemos comunicarnos a través de medios que creíamos imposibles y de cómo las discapacidades nunca serán un obstáculo para alcanzar nuestros sueños.Clarita y Pancho es una historia musical completamente original que contará, a través de la música, la aventura de estos dos niños acompañados de tres luminosas narradoras que cantarán y bailarán al ritmo de sonidos que nos llevarán a los años 60’s, la era de los grandes peinados, el Motown y la moda llena de colores. Todo esto estará resumido en un musical al estilo Broadway que divertirá no solo a los pequeños de la casa sino a toda la familiaFicha creativa:

The story is highly entertaining, humorous and informative.  It contains many surprises and unexpected turns, including breaking the barrier between the actors and the audience, engaging the public in a surprise conversation, and more - all while keeping the show at a high professional level in all of it's aspects. Currently, the musical is in development at the Shostakovich School of Art, Music and Dance, that provides extraordinary training and nurturing of  the artistic talents of it's  Performing Arts students.</div>
<div>
<div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Musical ""Central Park"" has grown since it's inception, from a dream envisioned by a small group of like minded artists, to a vibrant multifaceted production that has already taken place in three locations in the metropolitan New York Area.</div>
</div>
<div> </div>
<p>What we have achieved has been remarkable but we are not resting on our oars. That is why we are seeking support from fellow art fans and music lovers for the creation of KTA (Kids-Teenagers-Adults) Theater. This will be a first-of-its-kind as it will harness more talents in ways never thought achievable. We have great plans and our ambition is unshaken, what we lack is only your support.  The world is waiting for the realization of this dream of many, and you can make it happen with your contribution.</p>

<p>The purpose of this created theater isn't just to draw publicity to it's many performances, that interest a large audience, but to spark an interest in children and teenagers of all possible ethnic backgrounds for the arts. We believe that what is taught in school and in theater will attract children and especially teenagers and contributes to their strength as individuals, personal growth and mental immunity against the influence of the streets.  </p>

</div><p><strong>Arnold Shvetsov</strong> is a graduate of Moscow’s renowned GITIS (State Academy for Theatrical Arts, Moscow).</p><p>His work in Russia includes Goldoni’s <i>THE QUARRELS IN CHIOGGIA</i> at the Zlatoust State Theater, <i>DOUBLE DOUBLE</i> by Elice &amp; Rees at Stanislavsky Moscow Drama Theater in Moscow and adaptations of the Grimm Brothers tale FRAU HOLLE as well as O’Henry’s THE RANSOM OF RED CHIEF, which has been running for more than 20 years (over 1000 performances!) at the Gogol Moscow Drama Theater in Moscow.</p><p>In the United States, directing credits include TWO POODELS by Simon Zlotnikov at the Aborns Art Center at the Henry Street Settlement, Chekhov’s UNCLE VANYA at the 78<sup>th</sup> Street Theater Lab and the Stravinsky opera MAVRA at Merkin Hall. Arnold also helmed a production of ISADORA AND SERGEI by S. Nazarenko that played at the Wondering Stars, the Russian-American Musical Theater in New York. In the last few seasons, Mr. Shvetsov has worked with Classical Presentations LLC directing the new production of QUEEN ESTHER by A. Markov and musical CENTRAL PARK by D. Pruzhansky and A. Shvetsov that had its world premieres at JCC In Manhattan, as well as ONE DAY AT THE OPERA THEATER by D. Fernandes, N. Leoni, A.Shvetsov at 92 Y Street, New York. Arnold staged <i>CHAGALL. COLOR OF LOVE</i> by Z. Sagalov, at the Chicago “By The Way"" Theater.</p><p>Currently, he is set to impart the wealth of his experience and expertise to student as a part of his passion. This is very promising and delay cannot be afforded.</p><div><h1>When successfully funded…</h1></div><p>The first production, for which we are lined up, will be the musical by composer Dina Pruzhansky ""Central Park"". The story's synopsis involves children characters, who in a course of their play, find themselves in New York's Central Park, where they encounter various adventures situations and meet new ""magical"" friends. The musical is set for children,teenagers and adult performers (singers/actors/dancers) accompanied by orchestra. Our play may also accommodate several chorus scenes to include a group of children, some of whom may also play smaller parts in other scenes.</p><p>Not so long ago, the first production of the musical was held at the JCC of Manhattan. It was received with great enthusiasm by both young and adult viewers and the press. Currently the second edition of the musical is being prepared, which will involve even more young and adult participants. Central Park - one of the trademarks of the Big Apple. We are convinced that our performance will be the hallmark of KTA Theater and attract not only local residents, but also visitors of New York. </p><div><h3>The Impact</h3></div><p>It would be of a great benefit and an unparalleled gift for the younger generation; by allowing them to work together with professional performers. Young actors would receive an invaluable experience from cooperating with  seasoned directors, composers, choreographers and other professionals in the arts.</p><p>Performances would be held at numerous theaters in New York and even beyond it's borders.</p><p>Young actors will study drama, voice, choreography, stage movement and stage speech. The acquiring of knowledge and creativity skills will enable young talents to apply their skills later in their life paths. Classes in the arts make human beings evolve spiritually and mentally, no matter what profession they're in. The Shostakovich school has received a great number of tokens of appreciation from the pupils' families.</p><p>KTA Theater will have its own rehearsal spaces at the school, but theater rental for public performance, as well as the creation, stage crew fees,and production materials are expensive. We invite you to become sponsors and friends of our theater for children and adults.</p><div><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3></div><p>Our biggest challenge is not having this theater. This has made learning and musical self-expression unconsciously restricted. Students that will give anything to have their inner voice expressed in form of dance and music have been made to wait with disappointment due to the lack of production funds.</p><p>Our students should be encouraged to take the stage by storm and blow the world away with their amazing talents. They are born with these traits of greatness and our function and passion is harnessing and polishing it. Not having this theater has severely limited us in all that we do, but this is not yet fatal as we can quickly improve with funding and your support.</p><div><h4>Other ways to help</h4></div><p>Some people just can’t contribute financially, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help.

The plot of the Musical ""Central Park"" with music by Dina Pruzhansky and book by Arnold Shvetsov, takes place in Central Park, NYC.  A family decides to spend a day at the park - and once they enter the Park, the adventures begin. The musical, that is built to be enjoyed by the whole family, features musical, dance and drama numbers for performers of all ages. The story is highly entertaining, humorous and informative.  It contains many surprises and unexpected turns, including breaking the barrier between the actors and the audience, engaging the public in a surprise conversation, and more - all while keeping the show at a high professional level in all of it's aspects. Currently, the musical is in development at the Shostakovich School of Art, Music and Dance, that provides extraordinary training and nurturing of  the artistic talents of it's  Performing Arts students.


 
The Musical ""Central Park"" has grown since it's inception, from a dream envisioned by a small group of like minded artists, to a vibrant multifaceted production that has already taken place in three locations in the metropolitan New York Area.

 
What we have achieved has been remarkable but we are not resting on our oars. That is why we are seeking support from fellow art fans and music lovers for the creation of KTA (Kids-Teenagers-Adults) Theater. This will be a first-of-its-kind as it will harness more talents in ways never thought achievable. We have great plans and our ambition is unshaken, what we lack is only your support.  The world is waiting for the realization of this dream of many, and you can make it happen with your contribution.
The Musical ""Central Park"" is sponsored , in part, by the Shostakovich School of Music, Art, and Dance in Brooklyn, NY.  To find out more about the Shostakovich School, click here.
The school is celebrating its 35 years, over the course of these 35 years approximately 10,000 students have graduated. The school takes part in many charitable concerts and also hosts it's own accounting concerts for the students' progress. Several tens of thousands of viewers have come to see the performances of talented current and graduate students.

STAGE DIRECTOR and LIBRETTIST Arnold Shvetsov.

Arnold Shvetsov is a graduate of Moscow’s renowned GITIS (State Academy for Theatrical Arts, Moscow).His work in Russia includes Goldoni’s THE QUARRELS IN CHIOGGIA at the Zlatoust State Theater, DOUBLE DOUBLE by Elice & Rees at Stanislavsky Moscow Drama Theater in Moscow and adaptations of the Grimm Brothers tale FRAU HOLLE as well as O’Henry’s THE RANSOM OF RED CHIEF, which has been running for more than 20 years (over 1000 performances!) at the Gogol Moscow Drama Theater in Moscow.In the United States, directing credits include TWO POODELS by Simon Zlotnikov at the Aborns Art Center at the Henry Street Settlement, Chekhov’s UNCLE VANYA at the 78th Street Theater Lab and the Stravinsky opera MAVRA at Merkin Hall. Arnold also helmed a production of ISADORA AND SERGEI by S. Nazarenko that played at the Wondering Stars, the Russian-American Musical Theater in New York. In the last few seasons, Mr. Shvetsov has worked with Classical Presentations LLC directing the new production of QUEEN ESTHER by A. Markov and musical CENTRAL PARK by D. Pruzhansky and A. Shvetsov that had its world premieres at JCC In Manhattan, as well as ONE DAY AT THE OPERA THEATER by D. Fernandes, N. Leoni, A.Shvetsov at 92 Y Street, New York. Arnold staged CHAGALL. COLOR OF LOVE by Z. Sagalov, at the Chicago “By The Way"" Theater.Currently, he is set to impart the wealth of his experience and expertise to student as a part of his passion. This is very promising and delay cannot be afforded.When successfully funded…The first production, for which we are lined up, will be the musical by composer Dina Pruzhansky ""Central Park"". The story's synopsis involves children characters, who in a course of their play, find themselves in New York's Central Park, where they encounter various adventures situations and meet new ""magical"" friends. The musical is set for children,teenagers and adult performers (singers/actors/dancers) accompanied by orchestra. Our play may also accommodate several chorus scenes to include a group of children, some of whom may also play smaller parts in other scenes.Not so long ago, the first production of the musical was held at the JCC of Manhattan. It was received with great enthusiasm by both young and adult viewers and the press. Currently the second edition of the musical is being prepared, which will involve even more young and adult participants. Central Park - one of the trademarks of the Big Apple. We are convinced that our performance will be the hallmark of KTA Theater and attract not only local residents, but also visitors of New York. The ImpactIt would be of a great benefit and an unparalleled gift for the younger generation; by allowing them to work together with professional performers. Young actors would receive an invaluable experience from cooperating with  seasoned directors, composers, choreographers and other professionals in the arts.Performances would be held at numerous theaters in New York and even beyond it's borders.Young actors will study drama, voice, choreography, stage movement and stage speech. The acquiring of knowledge and creativity skills will enable young talents to apply their skills later in their life paths. Classes in the arts make human beings evolve spiritually and mentally, no matter what profession they're in. The Shostakovich school has received a great number of tokens of appreciation from the pupils' families.KTA Theater will have its own rehearsal spaces at the school, but theater rental for public performance, as well as the creation, stage crew fees,and production materials are expensive. We invite you to become sponsors and friends of our theater for children and adults.Risks & ChallengesOur biggest challenge is not having this theater. This has made learning and musical self-expression unconsciously restricted. Students that will give anything to have their inner voice expressed in form of dance and music have been made to wait with disappointment due to the lack of production funds.Our students should be encouraged to take the stage by storm and blow the world away with their amazing talents. They are born with these traits of greatness and our function and passion is harnessing and polishing it. Not having this theater has severely limited us in all that we do, but this is not yet fatal as we can quickly improve with funding and your support.Other ways to helpSome people just can’t contribute financially, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help. So even if you love this idea but lack the resources to pledge to its success, there are some other ways you can use to ensure this.You can win a Amazing gifts by spreading the word!

<h3>""JABEZ The Rainmaker"" @ SOUNDBITES 5.0</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Tom Hyndman a Composer/Book writer/Lyricist of Musical Theatre. My Musical Theatre introduction began in college in Maryland, where I studied with Sarah Schlesinger (Chair of The Tish School of Musical Theatre Writing at New York University.) My musical ""FICTITIOUS"" had it's premier reading at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington D.C.and ""World Wide Podcast ""Live"" Podcast "". From there ""Fictitious"" has had several performances in New York and Washington D.C. and was selected into the Off Broadway Alliance's Mentorship Program in New York City. Recently, I have been studying Musical Development with Stephen Schwartz ( Pippin/Godspell/ Wicked) at the ASCAP/Disney/Dreamworks Workshop in New York. Also, now in development is my new Musical ""Jabez The Rainmaker"" The Story of Cinco de Mayo.</p>
<p>""JABEZ The Rainmaker"" is the story of a young Mexican teen in the 1880's ,who has been appointed ""Tribal Rainmaker"". Problem is...He has no idea how to make it rain and to make matters worse....He is scared to death of thunder and lightening ! More than once the show has been referred to as ""Aladdin in Mexico"".   I will be presenting an excerpt performance from this  Romantic/Musical/Comedy on Memorial Day 2018 at the Signature Theatre in NYC.</p>
<p>This will be  the first major step into the world of live theatre for ""JABEZ The Rainmaker"". That's why this first step is so important. You don't often get a second chance to present at this level. That is why it is imperative for one to bring their ""A"" game to the spotlight.  My hope is to bring a polished performance, that will create a hunger and thirst for the audience to want to see and hear more.</p>
<p>This is why your participation is so important and needed. As many of you know everything is a little more expensive in NYC. Especially when it comes to mounting any type of production  there. Although, SOUNDBITES is an annual  ""Benefit""/ ""Not for Profit"" event. It still has many expenses to be met. ""Theatre Now New York "",""Musical Theatre International"" and ""Disney Theatrical"" are covering the major cost, such as the Theatre rental, Advertisement, Sound and Lighting and 180 hours of free Rehearsal Space and Ticket Processing Expenses. </p>
<p>Each show is responsible for finding and hiring a Director, stage manger, choreographer , Musical Director, cast, musicians ,costumes and props. These are out of pocket expenses I will need to raise hopefully with your help.    The goal to fund this performance is achievable, with help from  contributors such as you. </p>

<h3>A boy, a girl, and a band class. </h3>
<p>2007. Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. A high school band class. A new teacher from Toronto wants to be an inspiration to his jaded students but is afraid to come out to them. A boy bullies a girl in insidious ways until she takes matters into her own hands. An act of violence at a school dance fractures the community. <i>A Bear Awake in Winter</i> is a dark, funny, and difficult story about the fight to stand up for yourself.</p>
<p>Written and directed by <a href=""http://alijoyrichardson.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ali Joy Richardson</a> (proud Maritimer-band-geek turned Toronto-theatre-artist), the play has been selected for the mainstage of Toronto's curated <a href=""https://fringetoronto.com/festivals/next-stage"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Next Stage Theatre Festival</a>. This is an unparalleled opportunity to showcase this play (and outstanding team) to a wide audience and key industry leaders.  </p>
<p><i>A Bear Awake in Winter</i> amplifies teenaged and queer perspectives in the #MeToo conversation and was a finalist for the 2018 Safe Words New Canadian Play Award. It was developed in residency with the Canadian Stage Company’s RBC Emerging Artist Program.</p>
<p><strong>Cast: </strong>Michaela Di Cesare, Andy Trithardt, Danny Pagett, Bria McLaughlin, Natasha Ramondino, Andrew Di Rosa, &amp; Hershel Blatt<br/><strong>Creative team: </strong>Ali Joy Richardson, Bryn Kennedy, Lucy McPhee, Steph Raposo, &amp; Neil Silcox<br/><strong>Produced by:</strong> <a href=""http://www.binoculartheatre.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Binocular Theatre</a> (Ali Joy Richardson &amp; Bryn Kennedy)</p>

<h3>Join the band. </h3>
<p>Your contribution will support:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paying our cast &amp; creative team - a fearless team of 12 (most of us are young artists for whom Next Stage Theatre Festival is a significant professional step)</li>
<li>Renting/transporting instruments - can't have a band without 'em</li>
<li>Rehearsal spaces - alas, this play doesn't fit in Ali's apartment</li>
</ul>
<p>We're grateful to have some of our production costs covered by the Toronto Arts Council and in-kind support from Theatre Passe Muraille. We need your help to raise the remaining funds for this ambitious production. </p>

</div></div>","A boy, a girl, and a band class. 
2007. Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. A high school band class. A new teacher from Toronto wants to be an inspiration to his jaded students but is afraid to come out to them. A boy bullies a girl in insidious ways until she takes matters into her own hands. An act of violence at a school dance fractures the community. A Bear Awake in Winter is a dark, funny, and difficult story about the fight to stand up for yourself.
Written and directed by Ali Joy Richardson (proud Maritimer-band-geek turned Toronto-theatre-artist), the play has been selected for the mainstage of Toronto's curated Next Stage Theatre Festival. This is an unparalleled opportunity to showcase this play (and outstanding team) to a wide audience and key industry leaders.  
A Bear Awake in Winter amplifies teenaged and queer perspectives in the #MeToo conversation and was a finalist for the 2018 Safe Words New Canadian Play Award. It was developed in residency with the Canadian Stage Company’s RBC Emerging Artist Program.
Cast: Michaela Di Cesare, Andy Trithardt, Danny Pagett, Bria McLaughlin, Natasha Ramondino, Andrew Di Rosa, & Hershel BlattCreative team: Ali Joy Richardson, Bryn Kennedy, Lucy McPhee, Steph Raposo, & Neil SilcoxProduced by: Binocular Theatre (Ali Joy Richardson & Bryn Kennedy)

Join the band. 
Your contribution will support:

Paying our cast & creative team - a fearless team of 12 (most of us are young artists for whom Next Stage Theatre Festival is a significant professional step)
Renting/transporting instruments - can't have a band without 'em
Rehearsal spaces - alas, this play doesn't fit in Ali's apartment

We're grateful to have some of our production costs covered by the Toronto Arts Council and in-kind support from Theatre Passe Muraille. We need your help to raise the remaining funds for this ambitious production. 

Strike a chord.

en 1969, DAN s'est consacré au métier d'acteur dès ses plus jeunes
années, suivant, puis animant les ateliers scolaires où il joue
déjà Labiche, Courteline, Tchéckov, Anouilh, Camus.

<p>  C'est
donc tout naturellement qu'il a suivi les cours d'Art Dramatique de
Muriel Chaney au conservatoire de Nice dont il sortira gratifié d'un
premier prix à l'unanimité en 1991.</p>
<p>Dans
la même période sa rencontre et son travail d'acteur avec Daniel
Mesguich (1987)  vont lui ouvrir
les horizons de la créativité et de la démesure de la scène.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Après
un bref passage au cours Florent, et une année riche au sein de la
troupe de l'Alliance Française de Grasse (direction artistique
Georges Descrières) où il jouera Goldoni dans tout le sud de la
France, il décide de se consacrer essentiellement au théâtre
décentralisé et participe à la vie des quartiers et de villes et
villages dans cet esprit jusqu'en 2008. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ces
deux décennies lui offriront l'opportunité de créer et jouer de
multiples spectacles <br/></p><p>De
faire quelques apparitions sur le grand écran :  <span>
« Déjà mort » réalisé par Olivier Dahan / Casting :
Olivier Carbone, « Femme fatale » réalisé par Brian de
Palma.... </span>
</p>
<p>
Ainsi que dans la
petite lucarne :   « Brigade niçoise », « Famille
d’accueil »...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Mais surtout de
créer « La Compagnie Métamorphose ».</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Installé sur le Bassin d'Arcachon, et toujours dans la même
philosophie décentralisée,<span> il  revient sur le devant de la scène
en montant «</span><u><span> juste
la fin du monde</span></u><span> »
de J.L. Lagarce (où sa mise en scène remarquable sera soulignée
par une belle interprétation du rôle de Louis) puis «</span><u><span> Diablogues </span></u><span>», d'après R.Dubillard joué jusqu'au Théâtre de
Ménilmontant. Dans le même temps il sera le créateur et
l'organisateur du festival de spectacle vivant </span><u><span>ScèneFolies</span></u><span><u>.</u></span></p><p><span><u>Fidèle aux valeurs de partage et de transmission, il donne de nombreux ateliers et stages en milieu scolaires et pour des organismes à caractère social.<br/></u></span></p>

Dan est
actuellement en répétition avec  Aloïs Christ, auteur, pour<span> la
création de sa pièce :</span>   «

quand j’imagine la dernière nuit de Rimbaud à Aden, c’est à
une fiction que je songe. L’ébauche sera vite remisée dans un
tiroir 3 ans durant, avant que je ne l’exhume, les idées plus
claires. Ce sera un monologue, réaliste mais pas biographique.</p>
<p>Que s’est-il
passé ce soir du 8 mai 1891, à quelques heures d’embarquer sur
l’Amazone pour un retour contraint en France ? Quelle tempête
supposée agita ce crâne si singulier ? Voilà ce qui m’a
intéressé, hanté, pour tout dire.</p>
<p>	Les
spécialistes pourront me réfuter, je m’en moque. C’est en
amateur que je m’invite à cette soirée, du latin <i>amator…celui
qui aime.</i> Et s’il me fallait une
reconnaissance, je la tiens de Laurent Terzieff qui soutint mon
travail en 2005, avant qu’il ne trouve un éditeur en 2010, un petit
éditeur belge (tiens, tiens…) faute d’éditeur français partant
pour cette aventure immobile.</p>
<p>	10 ans, 16
versions et bien des projets avortés plus tard, c’est Philippe
Geneste, professeur de français  qui, découvrant <i>Comédie
de la Soif</i>, l’offre à Dan de Millo,
comédien avec lequel il travaille depuis plusieurs années. Le texte
lui plaît aussi. Il cherche un monologue. Nous nous rencontrons,
nous tombons rapidement d’accord. Ses idées de mise en scène et
d’interprétation me séduisent. Chose rare, nous avons à peu près
la même musique en tête pour faire chanter ce texte…</p>
<p>Son énergie,
son enthousiasme ramènent à la vie un projet que j’avais fini par
enterrer. Qu’il en soit encore remercié ici, tout comme Philippe
Geneste qui a permis cette rencontre.</p>
<p>Grand merci

<br/></div>","Compagnie Métamorphose est une association de promotion, et de création de spectacles, de festivals et d'événements en rapport avec l'Art et la culture, sous toutes ses formes et origines.Cette association fonctionne sans aucune subvention d'aucune sorte afin de poursuivre un chemin sans concession, seules les contributions volontaires et les artistes sont les piliers de nos projets !Les deux dernières réalisations de Compagnie Métamorphose ont été ""Juste la fin du monde "" de Lagarce et "" Diablogues "" de Dubillard, dans des registres tout à fait différents. En 2013, Compagnie Métamorphose a cristallisé le festival ScèneFolies, grâce à la volonté de tous les artistes qui s'expriment sur la vidéo en lien ci-dessus.Ce projet avec lequel je viens vers vous aujourd'hui, c'est le rêve de tout acteur et de tout spectateur.Une création, vierge de toute interprétation, immaculée. Jamais dite, jamais jouée, cette pièce est un morceau de bravoure, un texte fort et cinglant comme rarement donné !Un texte à vivre!  Rimbaud  en Afrique, loin du poète de ses jeunes années, un homme au bilan d'une vie d'aventures et de voyages, de folie.Pour ces (presque) deux heures de scène : Un acteur un texte et... Cinq panneaux  Un aperçu du rendu avec de simple panneaux rigides La toile cyclorama tendue permet les projections.Comme illustré iciqui seront le décor de cette chambre d'hôpital d'Aden en Afrique, en ce 8 mai 1891.Cinq panneaux de toile, cyclorama ignifuge de 2,5 mètres par 3 montées sur tubes d'aluminium. Chacun de ces panneau revient à 550 euros et permettra la diffusion de lumières servant de scénographie. Bien sûr 5 x 550 = 2750, les 250 euros supplémentaires correspondent aux frais de PayPal et Indiegogo, tout simplement. Sur un budget prévisionnel de 6000 euros, ont été déjà financés les lumières et le son, ainsi que les journées de répétitions, les costumes et maquillages, l'enregistrement en studio de la bande sonore. Une aide sera la bienvenue pour boucler l'addition. Il nous faut le matériel pour la réalisation de ces panneaux. Nos fournisseurs sont la société Volver France pour les toiles et cyclorama et la société Centurions pour les éléments de structure aluminium.Bien entendu, en plus des compensations mentionnées, nous pourrons fournir copie des factures d'achat aux contributeurs ( afin de justifier de notre démarche et de l'utilisation des fonds récoltés ), ainsi qu'un justificatif au fin de dégrèvement fiscaux. Nous avons besoin de vous en ces temps où la culture et la création sont de plus en plus malmenées... Contribuez, même peu, même un peu.D'avance merci.Quelques mots sur l'acteur
 « Dan De Millo »Né
en 1969, DAN s'est consacré au métier d'acteur dès ses plus jeunes
années, suivant, puis animant les ateliers scolaires où il joue
déjà Labiche, Courteline, Tchéckov, Anouilh, Camus.

  C'est
donc tout naturellement qu'il a suivi les cours d'Art Dramatique de
Muriel Chaney au conservatoire de Nice dont il sortira gratifié d'un
premier prix à l'unanimité en 1991.
Dans
la même période sa rencontre et son travail d'acteur avec Daniel
Mesguich (1987)  vont lui ouvrir
les horizons de la créativité et de la démesure de la scène.

Après
un bref passage au cours Florent, et une année riche au sein de la
troupe de l'Alliance Française de Grasse (direction artistique
Georges Descrières) où il jouera Goldoni dans tout le sud de la
France, il décide de se consacrer essentiellement au théâtre
décentralisé et participe à la vie des quartiers et de villes et
villages dans cet esprit jusqu'en 2008. 


Ces
deux décennies lui offriront l'opportunité de créer et jouer de
multiples spectacles De
faire quelques apparitions sur le grand écran :  
« Déjà mort » réalisé par Olivier Dahan / Casting :
Olivier Carbone, « Femme fatale » réalisé par Brian de
Palma.... 


Ainsi que dans la
petite lucarne :   « Brigade niçoise », « Famille
d’accueil »...


Mais surtout de
créer « La Compagnie Métamorphose ».


Installé sur le Bassin d'Arcachon, et toujours dans la même
philosophie décentralisée, il  revient sur le devant de la scène
en montant « juste
la fin du monde »
de J.L. Lagarce (où sa mise en scène remarquable sera soulignée
par une belle interprétation du rôle de Louis) puis « Diablogues », d'après R.Dubillard joué jusqu'au Théâtre de
Ménilmontant. Dans le même temps il sera le créateur et
l'organisateur du festival de spectacle vivant ScèneFolies.Fidèle aux valeurs de partage et de transmission, il donne de nombreux ateliers et stages en milieu scolaires et pour des organismes à caractère social.




Dan est
actuellement en répétition avec  Aloïs Christ, auteur, pour la
création de sa pièce :   «
Comédie de la soif, la dernière nuit de Rimbaud à Aden » en partenariat avec la salle "" L'Accordeur "" de Saint-Denis de Pile ( 33910 ) que nous remercions ici de sa confiance et son implication dans cette aventure.




Le mot de l'auteur, Aloïs Christ :	En 2002,
quand j’imagine la dernière nuit de Rimbaud à Aden, c’est à
une fiction que je songe. L’ébauche sera vite remisée dans un
tiroir 3 ans durant, avant que je ne l’exhume, les idées plus
claires. Ce sera un monologue, réaliste mais pas biographique.
Que s’est-il
passé ce soir du 8 mai 1891, à quelques heures d’embarquer sur
l’Amazone pour un retour contraint en France ? Quelle tempête
supposée agita ce crâne si singulier ? Voilà ce qui m’a
intéressé, hanté, pour tout dire.
	Les
spécialistes pourront me réfuter, je m’en moque. C’est en
amateur que je m’invite à cette soirée, du latin amator…celui
qui aime. Et s’il me fallait une
reconnaissance, je la tiens de Laurent Terzieff qui soutint mon
travail en 2005, avant qu’il ne trouve un éditeur en 2010, un petit
éditeur belge (tiens, tiens…) faute d’éditeur français partant
pour cette aventure immobile.
	10 ans, 16
versions et bien des projets avortés plus tard, c’est Philippe
Geneste, professeur de français  qui, découvrant Comédie
de la Soif, l’offre à Dan de Millo,
comédien avec lequel il travaille depuis plusieurs années. Le texte
lui plaît aussi. Il cherche un monologue. Nous nous rencontrons,
nous tombons rapidement d’accord. Ses idées de mise en scène et
d’interprétation me séduisent. Chose rare, nous avons à peu près
la même musique en tête pour faire chanter ce texte…
Son énergie,
son enthousiasme ramènent à la vie un projet que j’avais fini par
enterrer. Qu’il en soit encore remercié ici, tout comme Philippe
Geneste qui a permis cette rencontre.
Grand merci
bien sûr à L’Accordeur de Saint Denis de Pile de recevoir Dan en
résidence pour peaufiner cette création et  l’accueillir ce 19 juin 2015 pour la première.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

creating a dance film that honors and celebrates the architecture of the new

<h2>How It All Started</h2>
<p><i>Why interdisciplinary? </i></p>
<p>Why have just a chocolate chip cookie when you can
have an M&amp;M cookie with chocolate chips? Growing up in Florida, I could
never settle on that or making just one art. I ran from theatre to dance
rehearsal to voice lessons. So I guess you could say I grew on solid artistic
and academic endeavors- but never together. When I moved to Mississippi for
college, I focused on dance but used other art forms to fuel my choreography.
My last year of school there was a tornado that destroyed the performing arts
center- forcing students to find alternative avenues for choreography. In a
twisted way (literally!), I am thankful for that tornado because it was here
that <b>I found a love for video art that encompasses movement, architecture, and
historical and scientific context</b>. Through the creation of my first and second
dance films, I become aware of the connectivity dance merged with film brought
to a community. So now I am seeking to connect, bridge, and fill the gaps in my
new community, Austin, Texas, by continuing to make interdisciplinary dance
accessible through the creation of new work.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1069815/files/20141203202143-Dalet2.png?1417666903"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><i>So you’re new to the professional world?</i></p>
<p>“Emerging choreographer” is the word kids like to use
these days. I graduated in May 2014. A week later, my choreography was shared
for the first time professionally to the Tampa, Florida community and a month
after I packed my bags and moved to Austin, Texas. These past six months have
been spent making my video art accessible to communities at a national and
international level, teaching interdisciplinary dance making to elementary
students in schools, rehearsing for a dance that functions as both concert and
film, and brainstorming, dreaming and devising a plan for how to make
interdisciplinary dance accessible, affordable, and relatable to local and
national communities. </p>
<p><i>So are you working independently? </i></p>
<p>Yes and no. It’s complicated. Yes, because I am an independent choreographer without non-profit status. No,
because I have an amazing group of dancers who are just as passionate about
interdisciplinary dance works that educate and enhance a community. Though I
act as an artistic director, I work collaboratively with other artists.</p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: normal;""><i>Are you receiving any other funding? </i></p><p></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Nope! That is why <b>I seriously need you!</b> My last semester
of school I received a $1,000 award for creative/multidisciplinary research
&amp; through careful budgeting these funds have supported the success of
artistic endeavors the past six months but now that is fizzling out. I have
researched and applied for countless independent artist grants but they are
hard to come by and highly competitive.</span><br/></p>

<br/></div>","""Teel's work is rich in multidisciplinary references- pushing the limits in dance."" -Stigmart10 Videofocus Biennial, 2014My name is Morgan Teel and I am on
a mission to create, develop, and share interdisciplinary dance, in the forms
of live performance and inclusion of video art production that perpetually
challenges and artistically stimulates.It is important to me that my
choreography is accessible and interactive in the Austin community, as well as
nationally and internationally. Being interdisciplinary, what makes my creative
work unique is that it serves as a bridge between disciplines, cultures, and communities--
creating a dance film that honors and celebrates the architecture of the new
urbanist community, Seaside, Florida, is just one way I plan to do this in 2015.
How It All Started
Why interdisciplinary? 
Why have just a chocolate chip cookie when you can
have an M&M cookie with chocolate chips? Growing up in Florida, I could
never settle on that or making just one art. I ran from theatre to dance
rehearsal to voice lessons. So I guess you could say I grew on solid artistic
and academic endeavors- but never together. When I moved to Mississippi for
college, I focused on dance but used other art forms to fuel my choreography.
My last year of school there was a tornado that destroyed the performing arts
center- forcing students to find alternative avenues for choreography. In a
twisted way (literally!), I am thankful for that tornado because it was here
that I found a love for video art that encompasses movement, architecture, and
historical and scientific context. Through the creation of my first and second
dance films, I become aware of the connectivity dance merged with film brought
to a community. So now I am seeking to connect, bridge, and fill the gaps in my
new community, Austin, Texas, by continuing to make interdisciplinary dance
accessible through the creation of new work.So you’re new to the professional world?
“Emerging choreographer” is the word kids like to use
these days. I graduated in May 2014. A week later, my choreography was shared
for the first time professionally to the Tampa, Florida community and a month
after I packed my bags and moved to Austin, Texas. These past six months have
been spent making my video art accessible to communities at a national and
international level, teaching interdisciplinary dance making to elementary
students in schools, rehearsing for a dance that functions as both concert and
film, and brainstorming, dreaming and devising a plan for how to make
interdisciplinary dance accessible, affordable, and relatable to local and
national communities. 
So are you working independently? 
Yes and no. It’s complicated. Yes, because I am an independent choreographer without non-profit status. No,
because I have an amazing group of dancers who are just as passionate about
interdisciplinary dance works that educate and enhance a community. Though I
act as an artistic director, I work collaboratively with other artists.
Are you receiving any other funding? Nope! That is why I seriously need you! My last semester
of school I received a $1,000 award for creative/multidisciplinary research
& through careful budgeting these funds have supported the success of
artistic endeavors the past six months but now that is fizzling out. I have
researched and applied for countless independent artist grants but they are
hard to come by and highly competitive.
This Is Where You Come In
What we need: MOOLAH’S! To be exact,
$2,000.
Here is the 2015 budget in a
nutshell:


Artistic Staff: $355


Travel: $650


Space Rental: $350


Equipment Rental/Purchase: $90


Supplies/Materials: $185


Marketing/Promotion: $185


Production/Exhibition Costs: $185


What exactly does this all go
towards?
In general, it will go towards paying my artistic staff because their quite amazing, the
creation of new work, and sharing this work with communities through visual
and participatory engagements. For example, in January I will be traveling to
Seaside, Florida for a multidisciplinary residency in which I will create a new
dance film, host a critical discussion about video art with college students,
and engage the community with participatory workshops. I am thrilled that my 2015 season encompasses creating new work in my current community as well as the community I grew up around in Seaside, Florida!

</h3><h3></h3><p><strong>Hollywood 1949. A time when the movies were king and the movie stars merely pawns for the studio bosses. </strong></p>
<p>A time when passion was lauded but sex never discussed. So when naive young actor, Patrick Glass, embarks on a scandalous homosexual love

<p>The play’s
inception began back in late 2005 when writer Dylan Costello was living in Los
Angeles. Spending an unusually rainy day watching classic movies from the
golden age of Hollywood, Dylan became fascinated by the reality back then of
gay actors such as Montgomery Clift and Rock Hudson and how they dealt with
hiding their true sexuality amongst the cogs of the great Hollywood Machine.
Further research into the era uncovered truths and lies about the attitudes
towards homosexuality in the 1940’s movie industry, especially when the
moralistic Production Code was in full force, forbidding even the hint of
sexually ambiguous behavior on the silver screen. This was Hollywood after all,
a twisted utopia where image, control, money and power were the only things
that mattered. A place where the reality never matched the fantasy – and a
world that required the forced suppression of one’s homosexuality should one
want to keep their movie career. But this was the 1940s and you would think
that these homophobic attitudes would have been gradually erased over the last
few decades. But the sad truth is that they haven’t and still to this day, gay
actors are being asked to choose between their sexuality and their career… and
so the Hollywood closet is as full as it ever was.</p>
<h3>So this play deals with the important issue of homophobia?</h3>
<p>Indeed. The play highlights attitudes towards homosexuality, showing 
that the homophobia of over 70 years ago can still exist today and 
awareness of it must still continue without complacency. We want 
audiences to watch this play and be moved by its message, to show how 
damaging homophobia truly is - told through the story of it existing in a
 different era whilst realising that times have not changed as much as 
people think despite advancements in attitudes towards homosexuality.</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FTFE4s9_1jCw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DTFE4s9_1jCw&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FTFE4s9_1jCw%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><h3>So who are Giant Cherry Productions?</h3>Giant Cherry Productions is
 a UK-based non-profit company that was created with a singular vision in mind - to bring a 
wave of new LGBT productions to the global film, theater and television 
scene. Our simple manifesto is to have LGBT characters, stories and 
themes represented in the same way as non-LGBT - ie - to be seen as 
'normal'.<br/><br/>We pride ourselves on striving to put on original 
works, some controversial, some that push the envelope. We believe that 
creativity should be about taking risks, challenging audiences' 
perceptions and provoking their thoughts and imaginations.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/998946/files/20141109091624-giantcherrylogo.jpg?1415553384"" src="""" style=""""/></p>We believe it is vitally important for the gay community to see 
itself represented on film, stage and television. Issues are universal, 
regardless of sexuality. We are all human beings who all live, love and 
lose just like everyone else. We have love stories, we have tragedies. 
Sexuality shouldn’t be an issue. So we believe it’s always appealing to 
see plays, movies, TV shows where characters have the same problems as 
everyone else – and they just happen to be gay.<br/><br/>Over the past few
 years, our work has been nominated for (and won) several awards and our
 reputation is growing to an extent where we are proud to have this chance to bring a production to the US for the first time.<p></p><h3>And Giant Cherry are partnering with Chicago-based Glitterati Productions on this play. Tell us more about them.<br/>
</h3><p>
</p><p>Glitterati are well renowned on the Chicago theater scene and was founded in 2005 to produce Ken Ludwig's <i>Moon
Over Buffalo</i>, which ran for three months at Theater Building Chicago. Since
that time, the company has been involved in productions of <i>Gypsy </i>and <i>No, No, Nanette, </i>a
staged reading of<i> Mr. Shaw Goes to
Hollywood </i>at Victory Gardens, and along
with Pride Films and Plays, Glitterati co-produced the critically acclaimed
production of David Drake's <i>The Night Larry Kramer Kissed Me </i>at Luna
Central. Up next is a new musical,<i> Heavenly Evening, </i>which brings
together Judy Garland, Ethel Merman, Beatrice Lillie, Cole Porter, and Noel
Coward. Music and lyrics by Robert Benson with a book by John Nasca.</p>
<h3>So this is the US premier of 'The Glass Protege' in Chicago?</h3><p>Yes, indeed. Giant Cherry Productions is excited and honored
to be bringing its signature production <i>The
Glass Protégé</i> to Chicago theater audiences. Writer Dylan Costello first
connected with the Chicago theater community when his play <i>Hello Norma Jeane </i>was one of five finalists in Pride Films and
Plays’ 2011 Great Gay Play and Musical Contest. Dylan flew to Chicago from
London for the enhanced staged reading of <i>Hello
Norma Jeane</i> in 2012 and was so impressed by the work of director John Nasca
on the piece that he introduced John to his newest play <i>The Glass Protégé,</i> and a co-production was soon born. Giant Cherry
has always been impressed with the quality and reputation of Chicago theater,
seeing it as a valuable and extremely worthwhile market that easily rivals New
York. Having the chance to bring this production to the Windy City only
highlights the importance of the exciting Chicago theater scene and the many
talented creatives that inhabit it, for the reputation of this very meaningful
theater community extends far beyond the confines of the United States.<br/></p><h3>What we need and what you get<br/>
</h3><p>This play is getting a buzz already and we want to build upon and 
utilise this energy to achieve success in bringing our work to as wider 
an audience as possible. We feel tackling the play's issues and themes 
on homophobia head-on in an uncompromising way will only strengthen our 
reputation as a company focusing on LGBT issues. It's important that 
it's a success so that our reputation can increase which will in turn 
make more people aware of our passion for LGBT productions, visibility 
and rights a human beings in general. Our passion is to develop further 
as a company at what is a momentous time for us.<br/><br/>We have reached a
 point with the success of our previous productions in that we now are 
becoming a company that people are aware of - and more importantly - 
want to work with. Our reputation is as such as we have had - and still 
have - famous names wanting to be part of our projects and we want to be
 able to afford all those that wish to work with us, in that we can 
continue to build on our increasing good reputation.<br/><br/>This 
activity is also important to us in the uniqueness of the fact that this
 production will be running in both the UK and USA within two weeks of 
each other. This is the first time we have had the same play being 
produced on both sides of the Atlantic and this fact alone is increasing
 the awareness of our company and getting people talking about our 
artistic endeavors.</p>
<p>But none of this comes cheap. Our LGBT productions rely majorly on 
funding and investment from donors. Costs of a typical theater 
production include sets, costumes, marketing, hire of the theater, etc.<br/></p>
<p>We also have a super-talented cast and crew already signed up for the 
production who passionately believe in - and want to be part of - this 
exciting new play.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1028366/files/20141119030409-The_Glass_Protege_Full_Cast_Shot.jpg?1416395049"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>How will my contribution help? <br/>
</h3><p>The Glass Protege is our signature production and one that we 
feel very proud of. We want the show to be the best it can possibly be. 
Even just the smallest contribution will go a long way to helping find 
that essential item of costume or pay for refreshments for the actors 
during the busy rehearsal period. But more importantly, your 
contribution will ultimately enable the important message in this play 
to reach the audience that it needs. It's a time when LBGT rights are 
becoming more widespread but at at the same time, LGBT rights in other 
countries are being eroded in terrible ways. Homophobia is still alive 
and well and this show will tell the damaging effects it can have on 
those - and how their lives are destroyed - because of falling victim to
 it. Closeted Hollywood stars, your fun neighbor or the cute guy that 
serves you in the local bar, their sexuality will still be seen as 'an 
issue' by sadly so many. We had men from a certain generation come to 
see the original production of this play four years ago and received 
messages from them long after telling how the play affected them, as if 
it was their story being told on stage. The story of being gay in an era
 which criminalized them for being so. If this new version of the same 
production can reach and affect people in the same way, then it's a job 
well done. And your contribution, no matter how small, will help make 
that happen.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1028416/files/20141119031730-Britt-Marie_Sivertsen_as_Candice.jpg?1416395850"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p> </p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you are unable to contribute, that doesn't mean you still can't help:</p> <ul>

<h2>The Big Picture:</h2>
<p>In association with <strong>Bonne Compagnie Collective,</strong> independent dance artists <strong>Elke Schroeder </strong>and <strong>Christine</strong> <strong>Birch </strong>are in the process of creating <em><strong>Soft</strong> <strong>Limits</strong></em>, a new full-length work of dance theatre to premier in September 2014.</p>
<p>Under the mentorship of <strong>Iñaki Azpillaga</strong> (of the Brussels-based dance company <strong>Ultima Vez</strong>) Elke will be choreographing and performing this work with the dance talents of<strong> Christine Birch, Jane Alison McKinney, Sérgio Mendes, Kate Nankervis, Danielle O'Reilly </strong>and<strong> Brodie Stevenson</strong>.  This project will also include the musical direction of <strong>Valerie Calam</strong>, lighting design by <strong>Simon Rossiter</strong> and make-up and prosthetics by <strong>Joey Hinds. </strong></p>
<p>(*For more detailed <strong>bios</strong> of the artists please see below, and for inspiring images, dancers' photos and juicy videos, see our <strong>gallery</strong>).</p>
<p>In <strong>June 2013</strong>, <strong>Elke</strong> and <strong>Christine</strong> will be travelling to Brussels for an intensive 2 week research residency.  This first period of creation and movement coaching will be led by <strong>Iñaki</strong> and attended by <strong>Sérgio </strong>and<strong> Danielle.  </strong>There will be several dance artists invited into the process from the Brussels contemporary dance community (and the other dancers mentioned above will be joining in later creation processes).</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>And this is where we need your help!</h2>
<h3><strong>This is where everything starts!<br/></strong></h3>
<p>This research/residency period is <strong>invaluable</strong> to the creation of <em>Soft Limits</em>.  Even though we have to travel to make it happen, this residency will allow for:</p>
<p><strong>Concentrated research time: </strong> We will be in the studio working on movement research for 5 hours/day during the 2 week period - a lot of work can be done in this time as we'll have little interruption!</p>
<p><strong>Immersion in the Brussels dance community:  </strong>Brussels is the heart of the Euro dance scene and we will have the opportunity to soak in its different dance aesthetic by participating in morning classes and working in-studio with talented international dance artists.  This means we will deepen our knowledge of floorwork and partnering, necessary components of the <em>Soft Limits</em> vocabulary.  We will be breaking out of our physical comfort zone!       </p>
<p><strong>Mentorship with Iñaki:</strong>  It is truly a rare and exciting opportunity to be mentored by such a brilliant dance mind - and on his own turf!  He has also hand-picked the dance artists that will be joining us and volunteering their time to ""play"" with us in the studio.</p>
<p>This is just the <strong>first stage</strong> of our creation process.  From this, we will bring back a large amount of material and choreography that we can mold in our upcoming research/creation periods in Toronto.  In addition, we will be able to <strong>share </strong>the dance knowledge with our Toronto dance family.  We will be bringing <strong>Iñaki </strong>to Toronto to continue the mentorship process, as well as to lead workshops in partnering and technique (hosted by the <strong>TO Dance Community Love-In</strong>).</p>

<h2 class=""MsoNormal"">A little introduction to the concept of <em>Soft Limits</em>:</h2>
<h3>Definition: Soft Limits (from the practice of BDSM)</h3>
<p>Limits which are not necessarily set in stone. They may be flexible, may be pushed or may change over time and/or with experience or knowledge of that type of (sexual) play.  Soft limits require a cautious approach and, while appealing, can still generate an uncomfortable amount of fear.</p>
<h3><strong>Intrigued?  </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Here are few words from choreographer Elke Schroeder:<br/></strong></h3>
<p>""The concept for this dance piece comes from my studies at UWaterloo where I have been researching sacred ritual and its relationship to sexuality and the body.  As society becomes more sexually free, how does this effect relationships (to self and others), gender roles, and norms, and how is this reflected in media, choice of clothing, and ""personal"" ritual?  In sexuality, where is the line between sacred and profane?</p>
<p>In <em>Soft Limits</em>, I want to explore these themes through an apt medium: the dancing body.  Specifically, I want to express ideas of restriction versus freedom, adornment/clothing, fluidity of gender roles and game-playing.  This last idea of ""play"" is particularly rich for me - think of all of the games we played as children that could very quickly turn ""adult"" if played out in a certain way... Twister... Show and Tell...  Truth or Dare... Blind Man's Bluff... Tag... </p>
<p><em>Soft Limits</em> will be a piece that challenges on every level.  The movement vocabulary will be physical to the extreme - virtuosic technique interwoven with intricate partnering. The dancers in this work are compelling performers and I will encourage them to take risks both in creation and onstage.  I want to give the audience an experience that will shock and amaze but still be easy to connect with."" </p>

<div>
<h2>The Dirty (Practical) Details:</h2>
<p>For this leg of the process, we're looking to raise <strong>$7,000.00.</strong>  Here is where the funds will go:</p>
<p> - <strong>return flights</strong> to Brussels for Elke and Christine</p>
<p> - <strong>mentorship fees</strong> (at a reduced rate!) for Iñaki</p>
<p> - <strong>artists' fees </strong>(at a reduced rate) for the dancers involved</p>
<p> - <strong>studio rental </strong>in Brussels</p>
<p><strong> - accommodations</strong> (at a reduced rate!)</p>
<p> <strong>Food</strong> and any other costs will be coming from the artists themselves and any money that we raise above our goal (and anything left over from after the residency) will be put towards our <strong>next creation</strong> period in Toronto in September 2013. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>And Now, Something More Exciting!</strong></h2>
<p>We can't express enough how much we appreciate your support.  In return for your generous donations, we can offer you some creative gifts to express our gratitude.  As strong women, we decided to channel Greek Goddesses for our funding perks - we hope they make you smile. :)</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Other Ways You Can Help:</strong></h2>
<p>As dancers, we understand that not everyone can give monetarily... Would you consider helping us by sharing our campaign?  Help us by <strong>creating buzz</strong> for <em>Soft Limits!  </em></p>
<p>Do you have any <strong>contacts in Brussels</strong>?  We would love to connect with people living there (dancers and non-dancers alike) and possibly find a place to stay that would not be too expensive...?  We would also love to hear from you if you have connections for <strong>reduced flights</strong> or anything else you think we may need for our residency.</p>
<p>We also accept: love letters, hugs and high fives ;)</p>
</div>
<div> </div>
<h2><strong>The Finale:</strong></h2>
<p><strong><br/></strong>We are extremely passionate and driven artists and are excited at the impact that <em>Soft Limits </em>could have - on the audiences that see it, on the Toronto Dance community and on ourselves as dance artists.  We want to contribute to the evolution of contemporary dance in Canada by pushing at its limits with our work, and this research period Brussels is this work's first step.  As individuals, we have been part of many successful dance projects, and now we want to pool our talents in the creation of this new and exciting dance piece.</p>
<p><br/>With every ounce of our beings, we thank you for your support.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
These are tough times, as we are all aware. The global economic collapse of the past few years have all but gutted the funding to the arts in the United States. As such defunkt theatre finds ourselves in a position of an unexpected funding shortfall for the 2013 season leading into a major dual production of the landmark plays <em>The Children’s Hour</em> and <em>The Boys in the Band</em>. These pieces of theater provide a vital mirror to our society’s struggle with equality, humanity and diversity.</div>

<br/>Why should you care? How can you help?  These are both valid questions.  We are seeking emergency funding to fill the gap. Every little bit helps.  (and hey, all donations are entirely tax deductable)</div>

Herstory/History : a pair of landmark plays in repertory: <em> The Children’s Hour</em> by Lillian Hellman and <em>The Boys in The Band</em> by Mart Crowley.  Two of the earliest depictions of homosexuality in mainstream culture, these plays have been rarely seen in recent years  but they still have a great deal to say about the gay experience in America.  Lillian Hellman’s first play, <em>The Children’s Hour</em> is the story of two women falsely accused of a sexual relationship and the devastating consequences of that lie.  The nine men that make up <em>The Boys in the Band</em> were among the first positive depictions of openly gay men in America.   Director Jon Kretzu collaborates with defunkt theatre to produce two evenings of theater that mirror and inform each other, showing us both how far we have come as a society, and how far we have yet to go.<br/> <br/>*Note: <em>The Children’s Hour</em> will be performed at The Back Door Theater on Hawthorne Blvd, and<em> The Boys in the Band</em> will be site specific in an alternate location.  May 10th through June 16th 2013.</div>
