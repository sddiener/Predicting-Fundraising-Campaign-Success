The Story

This project is the result of a 15+ year journey that began with feeling the pull between two different worlds. Mainstream rock and worship. This project is the first taste of that new sound.

The BandBorn and raised in Ontario Canada, Josh began pursuing music at a young age and stepped into the industry in his late teens. Numerous collaborations have led to a #1 hit on radio & songs on television and movie soundtracks. He has multiple nominations and won Juno’s, Dove and Gospel Music Awards. He has toured across Canada and the US with  Manafest, Thousand Foot Krutch, Drew Brown and Sky Terminal.

This IndieGoGo campaign has been launched to fund the completion of this EP. There are some awesome perks packages and will be trying to add new things along the way. If there is something you would like to see, reach out and let’s see if we can make it happen.

<p>Homespun
is a multi-venue music festival that takes place over a four day period in July
in the Medway Towns usually in around 7 or 8 venues. It began in 2013 and has had three successful years. This year it will run from 20th to 23rd July.<br/></p>
<p>The aim
is to celebrate the best of Medway music together with some interesting acts
from other parts of the country.</p>
<p>The
festival is run by a small band of volunteers with the assistance of the wider
music community in Medway. Most gigs are free and the cost of the bands is
covered by the venues, mainly pubs. For the small number of larger gigs we sell
tickets to cover the cost of venue hire, sound equipment and artists. In 2015
we broke even for the first time. </p>
<p>The
ethos of Homespun is to be a grass roots community led festival. We want to
keep that feel. We don’t want to suddenly have a big bang and fall on our
faces, and neither do we want to change the balance away from local artists.</p>
<p>But we
would like the ability to grow the festival organically, gradually reach more
people, and attract some more interesting and better known bands from outside
the area. </p>
<p>We
narrowly missed out on booking a couple of exciting acts last year simply
because the financial risk was a bit too eye watering. No one gets paid for
being a Homespun organiser and that will remain the case, but we’d rather avoid
putting large amounts of our own money at risk.</p>
<p>The
money we raise will help us to</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Book
more interesting and/or well-known bands</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Be
able to use better sound and lighting equipment</p>
<p><span>-<span>  Do more p</span></span>ublicity
and promotion to attract more people and in turn to spread to more venues.</p>
<p>We don’t
need massive amounts of money to do this, we are still aiming to run a tight
ship and break even wherever we can. Any money not used will roll over to next
year.</p>

  Other Ways You Can Help Some of you just can't contribute and we totally understand; but that doesn't mean you can't help. Here are some ways you can:  Tell other people about this!

So, really, there are two funding goals: $5000 for ""...Bowling Green..."" and $19,485 for ""Only Love.""</p><p><strong>Here's the original pitch I wrote well before the Bowling Green incident occurred:</strong></p><p>Hi. I'm Noah Budin. Many of you reading this already know me and my music. You're here because you like my music and would love to have more of it in a format that would allow you to have a physical copy in your CD player or bytes on a digital device. That's why I'm here, too. (If you'd like to hear some of my songs, click here <a href=""http://www.noahbudin.com/music.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.noahbudin.com/music.html</a> and see what I have posted on my Music page on my website.)</p><p>People often ask me what kind of music I play and write. I used to struggle with that answer because, while I'm an old folk singer at heart, I draw from so many musical influences. But, lately, I've started describing the songs I write, and the ones I choose to play, as ""message music."" Not ""hit you over the head message music."" Just songs with words that I think are useful and important. For me, it all starts with a lyrical idea about something meaningful to me, my acoustic guitar, and a strong melody. When I have those three things lined up, I usually end up with a song that I'm passionate about playing and sharing, and that people enjoy listening to.</p><p>The climate is right for another Noah Budin CD. My new record - tentatively titled <i>Only Love</i> -   will only be realized with your help.</p><p>The goal is high: $19,485<i> (REVISED: $24,485 to include the second project).</i> That's not an arbitrary number. I've done a lot of research and pricing, and to do this project the way I believe it should be done, the way I think it deserves to be done, will take that amount of money. This figure includes pre-production, studio time, musician and producer's fees, post-production (mixing, mastering, etc.), artwork, duplication, and eco-friendly packaging. A full prospectus and detailed cost breakdown is available upon request.</p><p>Like every fundraising campaign, I'm offering perks. I don't have many. The real perk will be the new music with its messages of hope, healing, peace, and love, recorded with the best musicians available, in a professional studio, in a diverse and multicultural atmosphere of love and respect, so that we may be able to put just a little more comfort and inspiration into the world. That, of course, may a perk for me. If you look on the right side of the screen (or wherever it shows up on your device) you'll see the physical perks I'm offering: CDs, songbooks, concerts, etc. If there's anything you'd like but don't see, contact me and we'll talk. Oh, and you can contribute in any amount you want, not just the ones listed. You'll get the perks associated with the level just under the amount you gave (e.g. If you donate $75 you'll get the $50 perks) until you get to the next level.</p><p>Here's another thing about my CDs: I don't make any money from them. And I certainly don't make any money directly from this fundraising campaign. One hundred percent of this money goes directly into making the CD. But, historically, my CDs alone are not a substantial income generator, nor do I really expect them to be. Commercially, they're great calling cards. They're a great way to get people familiar with my music, which, hopefully, leads to more live performances, which is what I really love.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488382216/lom2rnhcnwuoxc57fuiz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>And, really, I just want people to have my music. Also, so far, I only seem to record one album every ten years. So, if you do the math ... the price tag really isn't that bad.</p><p>I craft my songs very carefully. I labor over the selection process. I do not put any filler on my albums. Every song serves a purpose.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488382244/yi70fopwpewiq0dvyxt4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>There are several fundraising platforms. I chose Indiegogo because, unlike other platforms, they let you keep whatever part of the goal you've raised at the end of the campaign, even if you haven't reached your goal. So, what happens if I don't raise the entire amount? I take what I get and go to work. I do the best I can with what I have. I may have to scale back and/or it may make the entire process take longer. But, at some point, I will have a viable product. And so will you. Once the funds are raised and I know what I'm working with, I'll set a timetable and publish a projected release date.</p><p>That's about it. Thanks for reading. I hope you'll consider giving in any amount. But, even if you can't, you can still help. Please share this campaign on social media and in any other way you can think of. These kinds of campaigns rely on wide exposure. Use the Indiegogo share tools.</p><p>Thanks again.

That, of course, may a perk for me. If you look on the right side of the screen (or wherever it shows up on your device) you'll see the physical perks I'm offering: CDs, songbooks, concerts, etc. If there's anything you'd like but don't see, contact me and we'll talk. Oh, and you can contribute in any amount you want, not just the ones listed. You'll get the perks associated with the level just under the amount you gave (e.g. If you donate $75 you'll get the $50 perks) until you get to the next level.Here's another thing about my CDs: I don't make any money from them. And I certainly don't make any money directly from this fundraising campaign. One hundred percent of this money goes directly into making the CD. But, historically, my CDs alone are not a substantial income generator, nor do I really expect them to be. Commercially, they're great calling cards. They're a great way to get people familiar with my music, which, hopefully, leads to more live performances, which is what I really love.And, really, I just want people to have my music. Also, so far, I only seem to record one album every ten years. So, if you do the math ... the price tag really isn't that bad.I craft my songs very carefully. I labor over the selection process. I do not put any filler on my albums. Every song serves a purpose.There are several fundraising platforms. I chose Indiegogo because, unlike other platforms, they let you keep whatever part of the goal you've raised at the end of the campaign, even if you haven't reached your goal. So, what happens if I don't raise the entire amount? I take what I get and go to work. I do the best I can with what I have. I may have to scale back and/or it may make the entire process take longer. But, at some point, I will have a viable product. And so will you. Once the funds are raised and I know what I'm working with, I'll set a timetable and publish a projected release date.That's about it. Thanks for reading. I hope you'll consider giving in any amount. But, even if you can't, you can still help. Please share this campaign on social media and in any other way you can think of. These kinds of campaigns rely on wide exposure. Use the Indiegogo share tools.Thanks again. And remember: Music brings us together, and together we can be strong.P.S. Starting at the $100 level, all perks are negotiable. If you'd like to contribute, but don't want or need the items or services offered, message me - we can work it out! I'm happy to work with you and meet your needs. Thanks!",3.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>Sono un musicista indipendente italiano dal 2008 in circolazione, ho pubblicato tre album come <i>Margaret Lee</i>, uno con il nome <i>Vuoto Pneumatico</i>, uno in collaborazione con Friedrich Cané (<i>del movimento dei cieli</i>) ed infine svariate collaborazioni per documentari o spettacoli teatrali firmandoli col nome Giacomo Marighelli. Ho usato il termine indipendente per questioni di facile comprensione, ma da ora in avanti me ne distacco; se amate le definizioni, parliamone come ""musica d'autore"".

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">T H E   P R O J  E C T</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 26px;"">Hi, my name is Andy Feller. I’ve been writing songs since I was 12. I started playing guitar a little bit before that, been playing music for a while now.</span></p>
<p>Nothing else brings me as much joy as playing music, the writing process and hashing out songs.</p>
<p>Up to this point, everything I have done as far as recording has been demo type quality so I’m super excited to  finally have some legit recordings going. I have been in studio with Josh Niles, he has a really awesome, cozy spot here in Nashville. Josh is such a good dude and has helped me a lot getting everything focused on what we are trying to go for. It’s been so cool seeing these songs finally start to come to life. </p>
<p>We’re doing 5 original songs, and we also brought some awesome talent in.</p>
<p>Will Chapman from Colony House came in and tracked the drums on the EP. He brought a lot of cool energy. He’s a really good guy and I’m stoked about the drum parts he laid down!</p>
<p>The dude himself Adrian Walther tore it up in the studio as well. We hashed out some really cool synth parts, I'm excited about those elements of the album for sure!</p>
<p>Of course I did some tracking as well which was super cool. Lots of singing to say the least! We used a ton of different guitars and amps to really dial in some rad tones. </p>
<p>At this point the project is unfortunately on pause due to lack of funding. We have just about everything tracked, but all the songs are still needing to be mixed and then mastered. Studio time must be booked and until then it will continue to be pushed back.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>T H E   I N V I T A T I O N</h3>
<p>I invite you to be a part of this process with me! It is not only an honor and a joy to involve others in this process, but it is also essential. Here is how you can be a part:</p>
<p>Your contributions will be going towards studio hours, mixing, mastering, &amp; physical merchandise production.</p>
<p>In return, you’ll receive the incentive package of your choice as a special thank you! </p>
<p>Please remember that if you want to help but don't really care about the rewards you can always enter ANY dollar amount on the pledge page, even as little as $1! Every little bit helps and every single pledge is appreciated!</p>
<p>Your contribution is VERY important to me, if I have any money that comes in over the goal it will not be wasted. I'm asking for the lowest possible amount I need to complete this EP. Any additional funds I make will go towards getting this music farther like filming a music video, booking show dates, advertising &amp; PR. I promise to put your money to good use. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>T H E   I M P A C T </h3>
<p><strong>It's difficult to express how much this EP would help.</strong></p>
<p>I've had these these songs and ideas in my head for a long time time now and it would be amazing to have the opportunity to get them released.</p>

Hi, my name is Andy Feller. I’ve been writing songs since I was 12. I started playing guitar a little bit before that, been playing music for a while now.
Nothing else brings me as much joy as playing music, the writing process and hashing out songs.
Up to this point, everything I have done as far as recording has been demo type quality so I’m super excited to  finally have some legit recordings going. I have been in studio with Josh Niles, he has a really awesome, cozy spot here in Nashville. Josh is such a good dude and has helped me a lot getting everything focused on what we are trying to go for. It’s been so cool seeing these songs finally start to come to life. 
We’re doing 5 original songs, and we also brought some awesome talent in.
Will Chapman from Colony House came in and tracked the drums on the EP. He brought a lot of cool energy. He’s a really good guy and I’m stoked about the drum parts he laid down!
The dude himself Adrian Walther tore it up in the studio as well. We hashed out some really cool synth parts, I'm excited about those elements of the album for sure!
Of course I did some tracking as well which was super cool. Lots of singing to say the least! We used a ton of different guitars and amps to really dial in some rad tones. 
At this point the project is unfortunately on pause due to lack of funding. We have just about everything tracked, but all the songs are still needing to be mixed and then mastered. Studio time must be booked and until then it will continue to be pushed back.

T H E   I N V I T A T I O N
I invite you to be a part of this process with me! It is not only an honor and a joy to involve others in this process, but it is also essential. Here is how you can be a part:
Your contributions will be going towards studio hours, mixing, mastering, & physical merchandise production.
In return, you’ll receive the incentive package of your choice as a special thank you! 
Please remember that if you want to help but don't really care about the rewards you can always enter ANY dollar amount on the pledge page, even as little as $1! Every little bit helps and every single pledge is appreciated!
Your contribution is VERY important to me, if I have any money that comes in over the goal it will not be wasted. I'm asking for the lowest possible amount I need to complete this EP. Any additional funds I make will go towards getting this music farther like filming a music video, booking show dates, advertising & PR. I promise to put your money to good use. 

T H E   I M P A C T 
It's difficult to express how much this EP would help.
I've had these these songs and ideas in my head for a long time time now and it would be amazing to have the opportunity to get them released.
A well-recorded EP would create so many opportunities for me. I've recorded demos, and have clips on my phone, but nothing I've done up to this point will even compare to what I will be releasing. This project is also critical to my music's ability to be spread and with your help this dream will become a reality.

I love to create imaginative concert programmes that combine the very old and the very new, through compelling themes that override our compulsion to separate music into different styles.<br/></p><p>I think it's important for professional musicians like me to provide opportunities for a broad range of people not only to listen to, but also to participate in making unusual music, including innovative modern, as well as specialist early music, because participating in the creation of an art form helps us all to better appreciate its value and its beauty. To that end, I am fundraising to support an exciting collaboration between my community singing group, Timeline Choir, the composer Kerry Andrew and her pioneering vocal trio, Juice.<br/></p><p>I founded Timeline Choir in 2014 to provide imaginative, inspiring choral singing opportunities for people with a range of ability levels, from beginners to experienced musicians. In contrast with the many amateur choirs that rely on popular standard repertoire, I want to establish Timeline Choir as a group that not only encourages beginners to take up singing, but also inspires them to perform cutting-edge new music, push boundaries and challenge preconceptions, bringing experienced and inexperienced singers together in ambitious yet inclusive projects. Members of the choir are not required to read music, but are encouraged pay close attention to how they use their voices, work hard and be open-minded. The choir rehearses weekly in two locations, Cambridge and Surrey, and I travel between the two places to conduct both choirs.</p><p>READ MORE:</p><p><a href=""http://www.stefconner.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.stefconner.com</a></p><p><a href=""http://www.timelinesongs.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.timelinesongs.org</a></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469288722/Waes_Hael_long_1_fowjjf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p><p>Timeline Choir, 2014<br/></p><p><b>Why Bard-Song?</b><br/></p><p>This November, Kerry Andrew, Juice and Timeline Choir will collaborate to produce a vibrant Shakespeare-inspired concert of vocal music, in honour of the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare’s death.

We’re singing the Elizabethan pieces in Original Pronunciation (Shakespeare’s accent), so you’ll hear all the fabulous rhymes, puns and peculiarities that get lost when the music is sung in Modern English.

The docu-series will be launched online and in conjunction with a strong social media strategy.  Our goal is to create music and a documentary that will inspire and empower in all aspects of life (Love, Family, Friends, Hardship).

    Risks & Challenges

With any project comes risks and challenges. However with the guidance of entertainment industry expert Bill Herndon (M2M Studios) and Jody Orellana (7 Sails Management) we feel confident that their years of experience working in the music industry and TV/Film will help us achieve our creative goals.  We are also so blessed as a family to have two great parents who really believe in the dream, to the point that they are also putting in their own money to help make our dreams come true for I M Coble.  We are a resourceful and determined family and we will face any challenge head-on. And with your help we will get to Nashville and record a great album and documentary.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Old Parish Churchyard in Irvine Scotland contains many historical graves, from friends of Robert Burns, one of the possible inventors of the screw propellor, a resurrectionist (graverobber), the family of a UK Prime Minister to the founder of the Glasgow Herald newspaper. There are also many other individuals with interesting and noteworthy stories of their own. </p>
<p><br/>The local authority has labelled some of the headstones as unsafe and may have to remove even more of them, so we thought it was time to make a searchable online record of the remaining headstones before any more history is lost.</p>
<p>We have already taken photographs of the main part of the churchyard and created a clickable map to allow these to be viewed through the <a href=""http://irvinescotland.info"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">IrvineScotland.info</a> website. However to complete the work we need help. We need to put time into transcribing all the headstones to make them completely searchable. There is also a second part of the churchyard which needs to be recorded and if we gain enough funding there is work that can be done to save the headstones themselves. We'd like to have the time to improve the clickable map, adding zoom functions and improving the rough and ready version currently in place. And we would love to have the time to research the context of the headstones to reveal the full stories and history they represent.</p>
<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>My name is Fred Moody, I'm a web developer by training although I've spent a large portion of the last decade running a brewery. I was recently made redundant, and with spare time on my hands I started looking into the history of my home town, Irvine Scotland. Although I've brought up two sons in the town, I am not originally from Irvine and with work taking up much of my time while I have lived here I knew little of it's history.</p>
<p>I found that for a ""New Town"" it has hundreds of years of history. Visiting the Irvine Old Parish Churchyard to see some of the fascinating headstones there, I found many of the headstones have been marked by the Local Authority as unsafe and potentially ready to be removed, destroying a site of historical significance.</p>
<p>Since I now operate my own web development company, which donates 10% of its time to charitable activity, I decided that to record this history before it's lost we have to act now.  I have spent time throughout the dreich Scottish summer taking multiple pictures of each of the stones in the main churchyard and adding them to a clickable map. However the scope of this project is outside of what can be achieved in the very limited time available and spending all the time the company dedicates to charities on this one activity takes away from what we can do for other charitable projects. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What we want to do</h3>
<p>With contributions from you, we intend to. . .</p>
<ul>
<li>Transcribe the remaining text from each and every headstone that has been added to the map.</li>
<li>Photograph the remaining headstones in the second part of the churchyard.</li>
<li>We will improve the mapping system used on the website to power the clickable map.</li>
<li>We will research the history of the headstones, putting information about the individuals interred and putting them into context with the history of the town and area.</li>
<li>We will support efforts to preserve the churchyard.</li>
<li>We will digitally record other historic sites around Irvine to promote the town and it's history to the world.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What you get</h3>
<p>This project is mainly to record and document the history of the town, so no major rewards can be offered for your help, however what we can promise you is that:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will be listed on the website as a contributor (unless you would rather remain anonymous).</li>
<li>You will receive updates about the project, with access to images and progress before it is released to the general public.</li>
<li>We will release a video recorded in the Old Parish Churchyard, thanking each contributor.</li>
<li>A warm and fuzzy feeling inside, knowing that you've helped a project to record a historic place before it is permanently lost.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Any contribution helps and allows us to work on our goals to complete this project, even if you can only offer a small amount it all adds up and will help us to do a little more to get this project complete. The more we get, the more we can do. We have endless ideas, many historic places exist in Irvine that are yet to be accurately documented and if this project is successful then documenting and bringing historic churchyards online from across Ayrshire will allow people descended from Ayrshire folk to search and locate their ancestors and the strange and wonderful characters that make our history so vibrant.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If we don't act now to record these headstones before they are damaged by time, or removed by the local authority for health and safety reasons, then they (and the nuggets of information they contain) will be lost.

<p><b>Hello fr</b><i><b><b>iends,</b><br/></b></i><br/>We're <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/3piecemeal/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">3 Piece Meal</a> - an experimental indie rock trio that dabbles in the art of bringing people together via progressive guitar riffs, groovy bass lines, funky beats, and thought provoking lyrics. But behind all that, we're 3 college students who aspire to live life making music, and using it to connect with and hopefully inspire, other people.</p>
<p>The band consists of Akiba Davis from Maine, Diego Baraona from El Salvador, and Asir Arif from Bangladesh. We met in Clark University about 7 months ago, and instantly hit it off. We've played over 40 shows since, most of them local. We've been working on our debut album for the past 5 months. We were initially expecting funding from our college, but we did not end up receiving that. We are already 70% of the way done with the recording process, and are going to need a helping hand in order to produce and distribute the album to you!<br/></p>
<p></p>

<p>This 9-track debut album that we're releasing is in fact a concept album about contemplating social and political revolution. The songs tend to raise awareness about various, important issues of war for profit, sexism, climate change, corporate capitalism, and more. A lot of people are already aware of many issues, but constantly find themselves in a runt when it comes to actually doing something. A lot of the album talks about how it is definitely hard to do our part and give back sometimes, but it's certainly far from impossible. In fact, we can still do a lot without having to make major sacrifices. Ultimately however, even though we aim to create art that makes people think, we're excited to see what you take away from our music, and how you use it!<br/><br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Check out this unmixed instrumental preview of our album! This is pretty raw and we're still recording vocals, but this will definitely give you a glimpse into the album's sound so far!</span><br/></p>

</div></div>","Who We Are & Why We Need Your Help 


Hello friends,We're 3 Piece Meal - an experimental indie rock trio that dabbles in the art of bringing people together via progressive guitar riffs, groovy bass lines, funky beats, and thought provoking lyrics. But behind all that, we're 3 college students who aspire to live life making music, and using it to connect with and hopefully inspire, other people.
The band consists of Akiba Davis from Maine, Diego Baraona from El Salvador, and Asir Arif from Bangladesh. We met in Clark University about 7 months ago, and instantly hit it off. We've played over 40 shows since, most of them local. We've been working on our debut album for the past 5 months. We were initially expecting funding from our college, but we did not end up receiving that. We are already 70% of the way done with the recording process, and are going to need a helping hand in order to produce and distribute the album to you!


If you can help us complete our debut album, you will definitely be helping us kickstart our careers. You will most importantly play a huge role in supporting young, independent musicians who do music for the purposes of bringing people together, strengthening the indie music scene, and spreading important messages about multiple social and philosophical issues.

What's So Cool About This Album?


This 9-track debut album that we're releasing is in fact a concept album about contemplating social and political revolution. The songs tend to raise awareness about various, important issues of war for profit, sexism, climate change, corporate capitalism, and more. A lot of people are already aware of many issues, but constantly find themselves in a runt when it comes to actually doing something. A lot of the album talks about how it is definitely hard to do our part and give back sometimes, but it's certainly far from impossible. In fact, we can still do a lot without having to make major sacrifices. Ultimately however, even though we aim to create art that makes people think, we're excited to see what you take away from our music, and how you use it!Check out this unmixed instrumental preview of our album! This is pretty raw and we're still recording vocals, but this will definitely give you a glimpse into the album's sound so far!

What We Need - What You Get!
 We need to raise at least 3000 US dollars to successfully finish and market our album. Here's where all the money will go to:- Album Production - mixing and mastering ($1000)
- Album sleeve/poster design - 4 panel wallet  ($600)
- Equipment - software plugins, acoustic panels, accessories ($200)
- Printing 200 CDs - ($400)- Social media promotion/advertisement/putting album up online - ($400)
- Additional miscellaneous costs - ($100)


The album is being produced by Rakat Zami and the album design/art is being done by Tilok Adnan from LINE. They're friends of ours who have agreed to give us a great deal on their services! Also, big shout out to Jon McClees for helping us with video and photography all this time!
We Have Many Unique & Amazing Perks!

<h3>Hello Everybody!</h3>
<p>It's Brett. I am a pianist and keyboardist and am starting my own solo recording project. I have been playing with many different artists over the last few years. Primarily you've seen me playing with Marcus Miller. I am ready now to make my own musical statement as an artist and need your help to see the vision through. I am so excited to share my new music with you. It is something I believe in wholeheartedly and feel that it is important to share with all of you. This campaign will help me achieve this goal of creating the music and getting the album out to you. Being an independent artist is tough nowadays and you really need a great support system to achieve your artistic goals. I need your help and I'm so pumped for you to be a part of this journey with me!</p>
</div><div>
<p>I'm in need of $10,000 to help me in this endeavor. This is not the total budget that I need, however it would put a huge dent in the costs of this recording. The money received  will be going straight into the recording process for example: studio time, production costs, and other guest musician costs. There is a lot of time, effort, and collaboration that goes into making a recording. I want to give you the BEST possible product and in order to do so... I need money. There are some pretty fantastic perks and incentives a part of this campaign that I think all of you will be interested in. There are small donation perks as well as very big donation perks! Any donation makes a difference and means so much to me. So please find a perk that speaks to you the most and please DONATE! </p>
<p>The music I am working on is so exciting. It is young and fresh and HONEST! I am putting my whole heart and spirit into all of the writing and playing. The vibe of the recording includes Indie Rock elements, Electronic/Minimalist elements, with some chocolate on it!! haha. I think you will all be able to grab on to a piece of this music and I truly believe it will speak to your soul.</p>
<p>So please share and spread the word about my campaign. Put it on your Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and all your social media outlets. Tell everybody you know!!  Not only am I excited to complete this project, I am so looking forward to having you all a part of the process and the journey!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are seeking $16,000 for our first round of funding. This amount of money will sufficiently get a prototype of the application on peoples phones. Since this start up is a mobile app, there isn't anything tangible that big investors can put their hands around and say they want to invest a large amount. In the future, we will be seeking funding from bigger players for upwards of $100,000. However, until we have a prototype of the app that one could try out on their phone, we cannot  seek professional investing for vast amounts. Thus, we have decided to self-fund and reach out to friends and family.</p>
<p>We don't know exactly how long this will take but we hope that it is as soon as possible. We are ready to begin development of the app with our first music API license and AWI server space moments after we reach our amount. M3 is currently listed as an app concept on freelancer and upwork, two websites to hire app developers, with more than 50 highly professional developers nearly begging to develop the app. In order to develop M3 for the best possible quality product, we contacted many developers. Our favorite developer, requires $9,000 for the creation of the app, $6,000 for the Soundcloud API music licence and $750 for the software space from microsoft. We expect the grand total to be $16,000. Awards and investments can be noted in the perks section. In addition, the M3 team has a market strategy that they are ready to implement and begin as soon as the process starts. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> M3 is going to connect and network millions of people through the common love of music all through their smartphone. M3 links social media features from the top media platforms in 2016 while also maintaining a strong fundamental presence of music- creating the only music app that truly connects people. Our app is precisely what the media world is lacking music wise and what the music world is lacking media wise within app markets. In the short term, the impact of the revenue that is earned is simply more hard work available for us because these are just the starting stages. In the long term, M3 is a movement to share music through your media like never before as your money will lead the way to an eventually successful, iconic, and innovative smartphone application. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As of today, our biggest step is obtaining funding. We have talked to a couple connections we have in the entrepreneurship world and most have them have said that they can definitely see the app getting funded but for the advanced and larger round after we have an app out there. Once M3 has a prototype available, we will start to market the app and expand it to our first 50,000 users. We expect to reach out to professional investors once we can include a prototype in our investment meeting instead of just words of what an iPhone app would be like. This is why we need your help. We have a road map for the companies actions for the first year of the applications launch but we need to get the app in motion. When more risks arrive, the M3 team feels passionately about the cause while persevering and come out on top of our challenges. As of today, we are waiting on one person that believes in our goal. We have high hopes for M3 - an app that will be much more than an awesome and interactive social media music app . M3 will be the ultimate networking application for music in the 21st century.</p>

M3, also known as Mobile Music Media, was founded in January 2016 and is currently owned by Samuel Terrasson and Seydouba Kourouma, current students at Syracuse University and Flaggler College. Although we are students in college, the M3 campaign deserves the extensive time, energy, and revenue that it requires for the final product, and we will fall nothing short of those requirements.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Your ongoing support of my music as singer/songwriter has enabled me to do so much over the years and I love you for it. The one thing that is missing is an album and this is where I need that one final helping hand. After thousands of lonely hours, most things are in place. Recording is done, mixing and mastering is done and the artwork is done. The manufacturing of the actual CD is the only thing left. You can help me produce my brand new ""PreFuture"" album just by making a small financial contribution.  </p>
<p>Making and playing music is a passion for me and something that I will keep on doing, regardless. But getting the music out to you guys is something that requires resources I just don't have without asking for help. So don´t hesitate to donate, to contribute, to a part of the PreFuture.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Total goal: $1000 - This will pay for the completion of the album and pay for the manufacturing of the CDs. </p>
<p>All backers will receive a never heard and unreleased song that won´t feature on the album itself. Backers above a certain level will receive a digital downloadable CD or an actual CD, depending on what you want. Everyone will be rewarded regardless of what level you pledged. Check out the other perks, there is something for everyone. </p>
<p>Please consider sharing this campaign in your social media posts.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The first songs were written in the 90´s and almost 20 years down the line, the songs have been tweeked and finetuned to reach as close to perfection as I can make it. Make dreams come true with whatever your contribution contains.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There really aren´t any risks in this venture because there is something for everyone. The challenge is sorted by sharing this :-)</p>

<h3>LILY - Begrav Mig Under ett Fjäll</h3>
<p><strong>Lily</strong> is a punk-infused folk trio from Umeå. We sing mostly about bicycles, mountains and death. We have been playing together since 2010 and are now about to release our first <strong>full length album</strong>.</p>

<h3><strong>What happens if we don't get all the money</strong></h3>
<p>The record will be printed anyway, but it will take a lot longer time before we can make it happen with less money. And by helping us out financially we poor artists don't have to put up all our own money to make this happen.</p>
<p>To keep the integrity of the project, we have no sponsors etc. All costs are payed by what we get from this campaign, and the rest is from our own pockets.</p>

<h3><strong>The Story of the Space Wizard</strong></h3>
<p>Music is healing.</p>
<p>When I was eleven years old and learned to play my first instrument, I instantly recognized that I was tapping into one of the most powerful forces in the universe. What I discovered was a new language—something that freed me in opening the gates to my heart.</p>
<p>It all started with the electric guitar, but soon I found myself trying to learn and master a broad range of sound. My journey through the cosmos has shown me the magic Celtic harp, piano, and—the most mysterious expression of them all—electronic music.</p>
<p>Planes of Consciousness is an album that I feel best represents the many facets of who I really am. It marks a major change of focus from fast, trance music to funky, organic glitch-hop and downtempo with vocals. What I created is a unique blend of healing beats and rhythms that invites dancing and celebration.</p>
<p><i>And, who doesn't want to dance and celebrate?</i></p>
<p>The years of experience that are hiding behind Planes of Consciousness are fun to recount. It’s not often that I give myself a chance to look back at where I’ve been. Let’s see…</p>
<p>I have released two full-length albums and two EPs under the Planewalker name, as well as four full-length albums and over ten EPs and singles under my collaborative side projects: Chaos Control and Mister Chill’R.  </p>
<p>In the last several years, I have had the great privilege of remixing songs by and sharing the stage with some of the most recognized electronic music producers in the world, including Phutureprimitive, The Polish Ambassador, Kalya Scintilla, Desert Dwellers, Ott, Rabbit in the Moon, Bluetech, Random Rab, Bird of Prey, Kaminanda and Govinda.</p>
<p>Currently, I tour and perform across the United States both as an electronic music artist (Planewalker) and as a Celtic harpist with my father, Michael Martin Murphey, as one of his band members. I recently performed with the Kansas City Orchestra for a crowd of over 7,000 people at the 10th Annual Symphony in the Flint Hills. I definitely could not have done all this had it not been for the support of my friends, family, and loyal fans.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>My Vision and Why I Need Your Help</strong></h3>
<p>It’s taken me decades to get to where I am today, but I’m finally to the point where a successful crowdfunding campaign is possible.</p>
<p>My vision for Planes of Consciousness goes far beyond the music itself.</p>
<p>What I see:</p>
<p>*  <strong>A full stage show</strong>, with fire performances (by me!) and belly dancing (thankfully, not by me!)</p>
<p>*  <strong>Vinyl albums</strong>. I promise, they’re not just for hipsters.</p>
<p>*  <strong>Album flash drives</strong>. These days, even grandma knows what these are.</p>
<p>*  Only the finest <strong>t-shirts</strong>, <strong>sweatshirts</strong>, and <strong>tank tops</strong> featuring my album art.</p>
<p>To kick off the project, I have organized an<strong> album release party on July 21 at Taos Mesa Brewing </strong>that features the debut performance of our full stage show with my dance troupe along with performances by five other talented music producers and DJs including Ecometric, Adem Joel, Kanizzle, Tasstik and Trillwax. This show is being produced to high standards, and will cost over $2,000 on its own to promote and execute. High quality flyers, a large sound system, several high-powered video projectors, an intelligent lighting system, and the cost of bringing other talented performers in from far away and paying them to perform isn't going to be cheap!</p>
<p><strong>What's in It for YOU:</strong></p>
<p>I think one of the greatest gifts of finding success in life is being able to share more fully with others. </p>
<p>Even if I don't meet my goal, I will be offering my backers a fantastic assortment of the products that I've listed above, as well as my professional services as a music producer and DJ. For those who are musicians themselves, there is potential to book time with me in my amazing studio. I have a vocal booth, a broad array of digital and physical instruments, and the passion and knowledge to help you achieve YOUR OWN MUSICAL DREAMS.</p>
<p>Beyond the perks, I'm offering you a chance to experience the magic of healing through music in a way you have never experienced before! This is extremely exciting for me, and I look forward with great anticipation to completing this project and seeing my vision realized with your support.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

What I created is a unique blend of healing beats and rhythms that invites dancing and celebration.
And, who doesn't want to dance and celebrate?
The years of experience that are hiding behind Planes of Consciousness are fun to recount. It’s not often that I give myself a chance to look back at where I’ve been. Let’s see…
I have released two full-length albums and two EPs under the Planewalker name, as well as four full-length albums and over ten EPs and singles under my collaborative side projects: Chaos Control and Mister Chill’R.  
In the last several years, I have had the great privilege of remixing songs by and sharing the stage with some of the most recognized electronic music producers in the world, including Phutureprimitive, The Polish Ambassador, Kalya Scintilla, Desert Dwellers, Ott, Rabbit in the Moon, Bluetech, Random Rab, Bird of Prey, Kaminanda and Govinda.
Currently, I tour and perform across the United States both as an electronic music artist (Planewalker) and as a Celtic harpist with my father, Michael Martin Murphey, as one of his band members. I recently performed with the Kansas City Orchestra for a crowd of over 7,000 people at the 10th Annual Symphony in the Flint Hills. I definitely could not have done all this had it not been for the support of my friends, family, and loyal fans.
 
My Vision and Why I Need Your Help
It’s taken me decades to get to where I am today, but I’m finally to the point where a successful crowdfunding campaign is possible.
My vision for Planes of Consciousness goes far beyond the music itself.
What I see:
*  A full stage show, with fire performances (by me!) and belly dancing (thankfully, not by me!)
*  Vinyl albums. I promise, they’re not just for hipsters.
*  Album flash drives. These days, even grandma knows what these are.
*  Only the finest t-shirts, sweatshirts, and tank tops featuring my album art.
To kick off the project, I have organized an album release party on July 21 at Taos Mesa Brewing that features the debut performance of our full stage show with my dance troupe along with performances by five other talented music producers and DJs including Ecometric, Adem Joel, Kanizzle, Tasstik and Trillwax. This show is being produced to high standards, and will cost over $2,000 on its own to promote and execute. High quality flyers, a large sound system, several high-powered video projectors, an intelligent lighting system, and the cost of bringing other talented performers in from far away and paying them to perform isn't going to be cheap!
What's in It for YOU:
I think one of the greatest gifts of finding success in life is being able to share more fully with others. 
Even if I don't meet my goal, I will be offering my backers a fantastic assortment of the products that I've listed above, as well as my professional services as a music producer and DJ. For those who are musicians themselves, there is potential to book time with me in my amazing studio. I have a vocal booth, a broad array of digital and physical instruments, and the passion and knowledge to help you achieve YOUR OWN MUSICAL DREAMS.
Beyond the perks, I'm offering you a chance to experience the magic of healing through music in a way you have never experienced before! This is extremely exciting for me, and I look forward with great anticipation to completing this project and seeing my vision realized with your support.
Thank you!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Drop the Bone</strong></p>
<p><i>Drop the Bone</i> is a phase I learned from my late business manager and spiritual advisor, Carolyn “Goldie” Rush – to whom this record is dedicated. It was great advice: “Stop gnawing on your troubles all the time. Get your shit together and get on with it.”</p>
<p>I met Goldie in the late ‘70s, when she was a partner in a management business called Organizational Common Sense. Bob Weir was one of her clients, and Jon McIntire was one of her closest friends as well as the manager of the Bob Weir Band at the time. We became friends over the course of a few years.</p>
<p>When a series of accidents led me to incorporate (as Truth and Fun, Inc.) in order to enter a contract with Grateful Dead Productions to produce and distribute the Grateful Dead Hour, GDP required that I hire Goldie to manage the business (and keep an eye on me for them). I was happy to oblige, and Goldie ran my business until her death in the spring of 2005.</p>
<p>Dealing with the Grateful Dead wasn’t always easy nor pleasant, and Goldie talked me down from a number of rages and/or depressions over the course of our collaboration. I have always referred to her as “my business manager and spiritual advisor.” She protected my business and my heart, and I still think about her every day.</p>
<p>Our mutual friend Vi©kisa made a painting titled “Goldie says Drop the Bone,” which I bought from her with the idea of eventually using it to illustrate a song called “Drop the Bone.”</p>
<p>A few years ago I proposed to Peter Rowan - who also was a good friend of Goldie’s – that we write “Drop the Bone” together. I’ve been a huge fan of his songwriting for decades, and I figured his spirituality and our shared love of our late friend would lead to a satisfying result. We worked on it in a hotel room in Ohio, and we had a couple more sessions at Pete’s house, and then our separate travels prevented more in-person collaboration.</p>
<p>Some time later, I got a message from Peter’s manager asking for my publishing info. Peter had finished “Drop the Bone” and had recorded it and was planning to release it on an album titled The Old School.</p>
<p>This version of the song was not at all what I had in mind – </p>
<p><i>I'm wanderin' around all day long / I’m a little stray dog honey when you're gone / And every evenin' when you come home / You throw your little puppy dog a bone</i></p>
<p>– but I like it just fine and I am honored to have a collaboration with Peter Rowan on my resume (along with two songs co-written with Robert Hunter).</p>
<p>I still haven’t managed to write a song that does justice to Goldie’s profound advice, but I worked the phrase “Drop the Bone” into another song – “Summer By the Bay” –  which is on this new record I’m working on.</p>
<p>Now, to the work in progress: It’s a studio record that covers the various corners of my weird musical universe: acoustic, electric; solo, trio, full-band; originals and interpretations.</p>
<p>These are the songs I have already started work on. I’ve got a few more songs under consideration; budgeting issues may help determine what gets recorded.</p>
<p><strong>Summer By the Bay, River and Drown, Life Is a Jam</strong> - full electric band</p>
<p><strong>Be Like Earl</strong> - acoustic quartet</p>
<p><strong>Your Movie</strong> - acoustic, with trombone</p>
<p><strong>Norwegian Wood</strong> (Lennon-McCartney) - “solo electric” with looping</p>
<p><strong>Rainbow Fox-&gt; Box of Rain</strong> (Hunter-Lesh) - “solo electric” with looping, beginning with an improvised piece.</p>
<p><strong>Pancho and Lefty</strong> (Townes Van Zandt) - acoustic trio</p>
<p>And these are the great players I’ve been working with:</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Hobbs</strong> – violin, cello, trumpet, saxophones,</p>
<p><strong>Robin Sylvester</strong>, <strong>Joe Kyle, Jr.</strong>, <strong>Dave Jess</strong>, and <strong>Allegra Thompson</strong> – bass</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Feinstein</strong>,<strong> Holly Bowling</strong>, and<strong> Bob Bralove</strong> – keyboards</p>
<p><strong>Neil Hampton</strong> and <strong>John Hanes</strong> – drums</p>
<p><strong>Greg Stephens</strong> – trombone</p>
<p><strong>Eric Thompson</strong> – mandolin</p>
<p><strong>Suzy Thompson</strong> – fiddle</p>
<p>As with my last couple of records, I have the great privilege and pleasure of working with two amazing engineers who are also good friends: <strong>Jeremy Goody</strong> at Megasonic Sound and <strong>Jim LeBrecht</strong> at Berkeley Sound Artists. <strong>Dave Glasser</strong> (Airshow) will master the record in HDCD™.</p>
<p>I’m looking for the funds to finish the record and get it mastered, packaged, pressed, and promoted.</p>

<h3>Representation Matters</h3>
<p>Nat Harvie Trio is an all-queer, post-glam, group that has been playing together since the summer of 2016. Nat Harvie (guitar, vocals) has been playing and writing music since the mid 2000s. They released two full-length albums with their first project, Vivielle, before the age of 20. They recorded and mixed Vivielle's second album (<i>Something That Isn't There</i>) as well as Nat's first solo EP (<i>Snow Is A Gift To My Fear</i>). They have spent the past few years honing their skills as a recording engineer and songwriter to craft their first full-length solo album, <i>Nat Harvie's Broken Record</i>.</p>
<p>In 2014, Nat began playing their solo music live with drummer Sam Williams (Chase Down Blue, Brain Bugs, Cabbage) after a short stint with her in the band, Paloma, Paloma. Nat recorded their first EP, <i>Snow Is A Gift To My Fear</i>, and taught Becca DeBoer (Red Mountain) bass for the release show in July, 2016. After a few shows, they decided to start officially playing as the Nat Harvie Trio. </p>
<p>Nat Harvie Trio creates a visceral sonic experience, exploring themes of queerness, identity, love, and death. They<strong> </strong>provide a queer, trans, and non-binary representation that is in short supply in the Duluth music community. Nat Harvie Trio provides a voice for experiences of queer folx through song-writing, passionate vocals, and genre-bending, dynamic instrumentation. Their presence is important to increase queer/trans visibility in Duluth's art community, and the music industry at-large, in order to create a diverse representation of queer voices and queer music.</p>

I am an artist based in the UAE, trying to make good music for the people. This campaign would be really all I need and what's left to get this album done and out there, after its been in the works for almost three years. I couldn't afford paying my audio engineer and designers and merch suppliers and album producers (physical copies) and artists collaborating and and and and ... </p><p>Long story short, I set it to a minimum because hopefully with the album launch, i'll have a little bit more money to carry on and give back to the community and everyone that helped. But for now, I need that first engine ignition push from you :)</p><p> </p><h3><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3><p><strong>What  I Need:</strong></p><p>Here is a breakdown of where the money is going:-</p><ul>
<li>200$ Audio Engineer for mixing and mastering</li>
<li>100$ Advertisement and Publishing it online (to ITunes, Deezer, Spotify and Anghami)</li>
<li>200$ creating my first batch of albums to sell.</li>
<li>150$ To rent venues for Launch parties and funding a small tour</li>
</ul><p>If the money never comes through, the most important of all of these is the first 200$, because without it, there is no album really. However, If I end up at least with 200$, the rest will fall into place.</p><p>If I end up with extra donations (I doubt), I'll be going on tour with it. It'll pay for my traveling expenses and stay in the countries I'll go to.</p><p><strong>What <i>You</i> Get:</strong></p><p>Now, what <i><strong>You</strong></i> beautiful people get in return. I've set up as many perks as possible and please check them out before you donate. Everyone that donates anything gets a personal thank you from me, and a hug (mandatory and non negotiable.) As well as many other things, such as your name goes on the contributors on the album, merch, soft and hard copy of the album, maybe executive producer, maybe even some original lyrics from my notebook (I don't usually show that to anyone, I have a terrible handwriting), outtakes that no one ever saw, some demos that never made it to the album, some songs that never saw the sun too. (depends on what you pay accordingly, check perks, pretty please.)</p><p> </p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>I was asked to write what difference would it make if you contribute in this section. To be honest, the album really depends on you. As I’m typing this I’m halfway through the album. My deadline to finish it is before the end of the campaign by 15 days. If I’m done with the album and I don’t have the money, I probably won’t release it till further notice. So again, what difference does it make ? All the difference.</p><p> </p><h3>Challenges</h3><p>I can’t emphasize on how draining it is to be producing and recording 10 tracks when you’re only 18 with no audio engineering degree and no producers on board. If there is anything I do to make sure I am making good music, I share the new songs in open mic nights and play some of my friends the demos to see what they think. Being self taught in everything can really turn around and bite you when you're the artist and you start doubting your own self. </p><p>It’s been hell of an exhausting ride for the last 5 years, specially that starting off and up until this day, I am getting 0 support from my family, if anything asking me to stop playing music. Continuous discouragement from high school friends about changing directions from beatbox to singing/songwriting and playing guitar. I’ve had my share of obstacles, so to avoid turning this into a drama blog. There has been alot of drama along the way, but this is it. ’SongsFromADarkRoom’ is in the oven, and I can’t wait to share it with you. </p><p> </p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Ofcourse! Some of us don’t have the bling bling (example: me). You can still help with no money! share this campaign with your friends. Spread the word, help me promote the album when its out. If you’re an artist of any sort reach out for me and maybe you can help with the album itself.</p><p> </p><p>Much love and appreciation If you read till here,</p><p>I am G-Beat, and you’re Awesome,</p><p>Peace.</p></div>","Debut Album Funding'SongsFromADarkRoom'My stage name is G-Beat, my real name is Jamal.

200$ creating my first batch of albums to sell.
150$ To rent venues for Launch parties and funding a small tour
If the money never comes through, the most important of all of these is the first 200$, because without it, there is no album really. However, If I end up at least with 200$, the rest will fall into place.If I end up with extra donations (I doubt), I'll be going on tour with it. It'll pay for my traveling expenses and stay in the countries I'll go to.What You Get:Now, what You beautiful people get in return. I've set up as many perks as possible and please check them out before you donate. Everyone that donates anything gets a personal thank you from me, and a hug (mandatory and non negotiable.) As well as many other things, such as your name goes on the contributors on the album, merch, soft and hard copy of the album, maybe executive producer, maybe even some original lyrics from my notebook (I don't usually show that to anyone, I have a terrible handwriting), outtakes that no one ever saw, some demos that never made it to the album, some songs that never saw the sun too. (depends on what you pay accordingly, check perks, pretty please.) The ImpactI was asked to write what difference would it make if you contribute in this section. To be honest, the album really depends on you. As I’m typing this I’m halfway through the album. My deadline to finish it is before the end of the campaign by 15 days. If I’m done with the album and I don’t have the money, I probably won’t release it till further notice. So again, what difference does it make ? All the difference. ChallengesI can’t emphasize on how draining it is to be producing and recording 10 tracks when you’re only 18 with no audio engineering degree and no producers on board. If there is anything I do to make sure I am making good music, I share the new songs in open mic nights and play some of my friends the demos to see what they think. Being self taught in everything can really turn around and bite you when you're the artist and you start doubting your own self. It’s been hell of an exhausting ride for the last 5 years, specially that starting off and up until this day, I am getting 0 support from my family, if anything asking me to stop playing music. Continuous discouragement from high school friends about changing directions from beatbox to singing/songwriting and playing guitar. I’ve had my share of obstacles, so to avoid turning this into a drama blog. There has been alot of drama along the way, but this is it. ’SongsFromADarkRoom’ is in the oven, and I can’t wait to share it with you.  Other Ways You Can HelpOfcourse! Some of us don’t have the bling bling (example: me). You can still help with no money! share this campaign with your friends. Spread the word, help me promote the album when its out. If you’re an artist of any sort reach out for me and maybe you can help with the album itself. Much love and appreciation If you read till here,I am G-Beat, and you’re Awesome,Peace.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What is The Alaska Music Show?</h3>
<p>The Alaska Music Show is an independent Alaskan Music Show which plays Alaskan-made music on the air eight hours every day. It's currently on KONR 106.1 FM in Anchorage weekdays from 10 am to 6 pm. It's been an incredible undertaking with a great response from listeners. We play hundreds of Alaskan artists who have recorded thousands of songs made right here in Alaska. We're dedicated to representing each of them through The Alaska Music Show.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Here's where you come in</h3>
<p>By supporting The Alaska Music Show, you're helping deliver great Alaskan Music to an audience of hundreds of thousands of interested listeners via the airwaves. </p>
<p>To keep creating the show, we need production support. It takes time and effort to find new music and put it into rotation. It takes a studio to record announcements and create every show. It's a professional undertaking and labor of love.</p>
<p>Your contribution also forwards our efforts in creating the future 24/7 online version of the show. We've come this far on our own, but there is more work ahead. So to keep new shows coming, we need your support.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What's in it for you?</h3>
<p>What do you get for supporting The Alaska Music Show? We're glad you asked. You will be appropriately acknowledged and fawned over on the air as a full-fledged supporter of The Alaska Music Show and recognized as an all-around advocate of music and art in Alaska.  Depending on the level of support, we'll also send you some cool Alaskan CDs we've discovered deep in the vaults.</p>
<p>Remember, this is an ALASKAN Music Show. We're not programmed by someone in Los Angeles. Everything you hear on the air was recorded right here in Alaska. If you can drive a dog team there, we probably have an album from that town or village. This is YOUR music show because you live here (or love Alaska from a distance.) The chances are excellent that you even personally know someone on our playlist - they probably told you about this fundraiser. Alaskan musicians have been making friends and uniquely independent music for a long time and now is their chance for everyone to hear it.</p>
<p>We've worked for years building this music collection and creating a platform to bring this music to our listeners. Thus far the expense has been out of our own pockets because we wanted to prove we could deliver a full-fledged show before we asked for anything. And now the Proof is on the radio. Literally, actually, because there's an Alaskan band called ""Proof"".</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other cool things about the show...</h3>
<p>RURAL ALASKA - Your contribution also helps us produce segments for outlying and rural Alaskan areas that wouldn't receive the show otherwise. It's available for stations outside Anchorage in Southeast, Interior and Rural Alaska to download and air for FREE. How cool is that?<br/><br/>We appreciate that maybe you can't support this financially, but CAN support the show through your personal contacts and by making your own special noise about it with the Indiegogo share tools.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Caught somewhere between a gig, an exhibition and a cabaret night, <strong>STOP ALL THE CLOCKS</strong> brings together <strong>Shadow Opera’s incredible artists</strong>, some of London’s finest young <strong>film-makers</strong>, cabaret superstar <strong>Frieda Love</strong> and some brilliant music. Our film-makers have all made short films inspired by the music our singers will be <strong>performing live</strong>, creating immersive, engaging vignettes. Featuring music by Weill, Schoenberg, Berg, Britten, Satie and Poulenc (don’t know who they are? doesn't matter, they’re dead anyway…), the evening promises to delight, inspire and thoroughly seduce you with delicious musical oddities! And to top it all, the <strong>bar’s open throughout </strong>the performance (gin’s not just for intervals)!</p>
<p>We’re doing 3 nights at the Copeland Gallery, Peckham (one of those cripplingly cool, warehouse spaces – stop rolling your eyes, you know you love them). Dates are <strong>November 9th, 10th and 11th</strong>. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>Shadow Opera needs your help</strong>! We are fundraising for some of our production costs (projectors and lights don’t come cheap!). Your donations will help us  give this event a spectacular setting and get people to leave those pesky preconceptions at the door. </p>
<ul><li>We need to raise £5000 to cover lighting, projection hire and some other technical trickery.</li></ul>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>What if we fall short? Whatever happens, the show must go on! Thrifty things that we are,  we will stage a great show in November no matter what. But these funds will help us make this event really special and we need special concerts if classical music is going to reach new, young audiences.</li>
<li>We know it's not enough for the musical world to lament it's aging and shrinking audiences. We know artists need to take risks and find new ways of reaching people with this brilliant music. Besides, the risks of not experimenting are far greater!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>What’s our objective? To make classical music cool, man (yeah I heard too). No, we want to show there are ways to engage with classical music which don’t involve sitting in silence in a room for 2 hours whilst strangers cough on you.</p>
<p>There’s a huge appetite for immersive, unusual cultural happenings (think Punchdrunk, Secret Cinema etc.) and yet the classical music world is doing little to harvest this potential. So your money will help us create a space where curious peeps can come and experience classical music in a way that engages and entertains them</p>
</div><div> </div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Strapped for cash? Even if you can’t donate anything you can still help us by <strong>getting the word out there.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Please share this campaign</strong>, like us on Facebook, share our posts and tweets, shout about what we’re doing to your nearest and dearest and it will really help us not only promote this event, but also our mission to give people a way of enjoying classical music who would otherwise run the other way. </p>

<h3>Why Sing Louder?</h3>
<p>Music is the most potent tool I know to break down walls, slip through barricades, and connect with each other. And when we authentically connect, we can change the world. Now more than ever we need to be courageous enough to transcend emotional, intellectual, and political barriers, and raise our voices…together.</p>
<p>For the past 6 months I’ve been in the studio tracking a new record to be released this Fall. The songs I've chosen to include on this record give voice to my story, and hopefully resonate with others in a way that inspires them to give voice to their own. When we share our stories, we not only heal ourselves, but empower others to do the same.</p>
<p>I’ve seen the songs on this record move people to raise their voices together, and speak their own truths in a way that makes a difference to them, to others, and to the world. Singing is empowering. Singing together even more so. When we raise our voices in community, they resonate, are amplified, and we are heard. That's why I've chosen songs for this record that feature voices raised together, whether two voices in harmony, a gospel choir, or a community of voices.</p>
<p>I hope people hear this record and understand that they too, can join in, express themselves in community, speak their truth, tell their story, and make a difference. Every voice matters.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Live what you love</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Love what you do</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Laugh with your friends</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Cry with them, too</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Sing every day</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Sing out loud sing out clear</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">If you don’t know the words…</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Sing Louder!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>So, what next?</h3>
<p>We've finished tracking the record, We brought in a local gospel choir, players from all sorts of fabulous bands, and a chorus of voices from our community. Now it's time to share the record with communities around the world.</p>
<p>In 1971 the world was asked to sing in perfect harmony; now we're asking you to ""Sing Louder"" and be heard above the noise.</p>
<ul>
<li>With $12,000 we can mix, master, design, press and release the record</li>

<h3>What else?</h3>
<p><strong>The Sing Louder Singers</strong></p>
<p>I've played shows in bars and coffee houses, in living rooms and auditoriums, on festival stages in fields and on farms, and the most empowering part of every show is hearing all of the voices singing back at me. People join in, maybe tentatively at first, but always growing louder and stronger and finally releasing into the bliss that is a chorus of voices raised together.</p>
<p>I've tried to capture that glorious sound coming back at me on the title track of “Sing Louder”. Forty-six souls gathered at MorningStar Studios on July 8th to raise their voices, and share their intentions with the world. Many of them stepped way out of their comfort zones to don headphones and sing into a mic. They held signs and shared dreams, they sang with passion, joy and abandon. The energy was indescribable, and that's why I'm so glad we captured it on tape and on video and we'll be sharing it with the world on this new record!!</p>

Music is the most potent tool I know to break down walls, slip through barricades, and connect with each other. And when we authentically connect, we can change the world. Now more than ever we need to be courageous enough to transcend emotional, intellectual, and political barriers, and raise our voices…together.
For the past 6 months I’ve been in the studio tracking a new record to be released this Fall. The songs I've chosen to include on this record give voice to my story, and hopefully resonate with others in a way that inspires them to give voice to their own. When we share our stories, we not only heal ourselves, but empower others to do the same.
I’ve seen the songs on this record move people to raise their voices together, and speak their own truths in a way that makes a difference to them, to others, and to the world. Singing is empowering. Singing together even more so. When we raise our voices in community, they resonate, are amplified, and we are heard. That's why I've chosen songs for this record that feature voices raised together, whether two voices in harmony, a gospel choir, or a community of voices.
I hope people hear this record and understand that they too, can join in, express themselves in community, speak their truth, tell their story, and make a difference. Every voice matters.
Live what you love
Love what you do
Laugh with your friends
Cry with them, too
Sing every day
Sing out loud sing out clear
If you don’t know the words…
Sing Louder!

So, what next?
We've finished tracking the record, We brought in a local gospel choir, players from all sorts of fabulous bands, and a chorus of voices from our community. Now it's time to share the record with communities around the world.
In 1971 the world was asked to sing in perfect harmony; now we're asking you to ""Sing Louder"" and be heard above the noise.

With $12,000 we can mix, master, design, press and release the record
With $15,000 we can make a powerful music video of the song ""Sing Louder"" to promote and share the message behind ""Sing Louder""
With $20,000 we can run a full scale radio and video promo campaign to have ""Sing Louder"" heard by the world

Every contribution makes a difference and is rewarded with, at the very least, my sincere gratitude. We also have some fun perks like house concerts, workshops and personalized songs, as well as pre-release signed copies of the CD, a limited edition ""Sing Louder Singers"" T-shirt with the names of all of the voices from our community choir listed on the back!

Why is “Sounds of Revolution” important? What impact do we wish to have with the music?

“Reggae should be a force for change. I wrote this album for the freedom of all of the innocent people of the world who are still fighting for their rights. African Americans, Jews, Syrians, North Koreans to name a few. The citizens are innocent, but what can we do to stop those who want to take advantage or enslave the souls of these people. This album is a call to unity. Bob Marley predicted reggae would return to Africa, I wish to speak in his spirit and call out to everyone to sing and dance “ONE LOVE” again. As long as we are separate, none among us is free. Let us all the downtrodden peoples of the world unite and fight for our rights. Fight for the rights of our brothers and sisters who can’t fight for themselves.” -Peace Bambo

I am Leah Prout Bambo, band manager of Jah Tribe Band and wife of lead: Habib Peace Bambo. I fell in love with the man and the message, and if you listen, I think you will too. As an artist, Peace Bambo is doing something which is now relatively rare in Rwanda. That is producing live, original music. Many of the country’s artists perished in the genocide. Since that time a new wave of low quality popular music has taken over. It is not uncommon to attend a “popular” concert here, where the “performer” puts on a CD and lip syncs over the track. The challenge is that live music is much more costly and time consuming both to perform and produce.

Peace Bambo and his musicians have produced an original work unlike anything being done in East Africa today. In addition to the integrity of the music itself, the music contains important and relevant messages. Messages include: uniting people no matter what color, ethnicity or religion; encouraging people to read and find information for themselves; and speaking against corruption, terrorism, racism.

The album is 90% done, but we need your help to complete the work, and bring it to market. 
We are asking for $6,000. This will go toward the following:
Studio and production payment
Payment of musicians (back up singer, saxophone and solo guitar artists are receiving $30 per song)
Payment of transport for musicians (more than half of the musicians are volunteering, receiving only a reimbursement for transportation cost.)
CD printing
Payment of practice room
Musician transport for practices
*In the event that we do not receive full funding, we will use what we get toward completing the album itself and seek other sponsorship for practices.

Contributors will receive perks, including: 
Two songs (digital copy) (Under $25)
A pre-release digital copy of the complete album ($25)
A pre-release with a bonus track from the second album ($50)
Album, bonus track and personal video thank you message from band members ($75)
Album, bonus track, video message and named thank you in album cover ($100 +)
Album, bonus track, video message, thank you and life-time ½ price tickets with back stage pass (Over $100)

Your contribution will help to release this album, but also to provide a livelihood for the talented, dedicated and struggling musicians of Jah Tribe Band. Many of the artists have been working for free or at reduced payment because they believe in the project. Helping us to launch this album will also help to provide work for more than ten people.

<h3>Resumen</h3> <p>Estudio Choralia es un proyecto en crecimiento dirigido de la mano de nuestro joven director, <strong>Fabián Vargas</strong>: quien con 23 años ya cuenta con una amplia trayectoria musical como director coral y cantante. Es él quien le da vida a este sueño en una época de constante auge en la disciplina coral.</p>
<p><strong>Estudio Choralia</strong> ha logrado codearse con grandes exponentes de la música coral tales como  <i>T. J. Harper</i> profesor asociado de música y director de actividades corales del Providence College, en Rhode Island, Estados Unidos; la visita del Maestro <i>Masahiko Shimizu</i>, profesor de la Universidad de Bellas Artes de Tokio y la Universidad de Tsuru quien actualmente funge como vicepresidente de la Federeración Coral Japonesa. Así como el <i>Dr. Paul Hondorp,</i> quien preside  la  Kentucky American Choral Directors Association (KACDA), y es el actual director de actividades corales de la Western Kentucky University, con quienes <strong>Estudio Choralia </strong>tendrá el honor de compartir el escenario durante su gira a Costa Rica, el 18 de mayo del presente año en el Teatro de Alajuela.</p>
<p>Ha sido el coro anfitrión del Festival Costa Rica Canta además de ser coro afiliado a la ACDA Costa Rica (única sede externa a los Estados Unidos de la asociación coral más importante del mundo).</p>
<p>En Agosto del 2018, conquistaremos una meta más: ¡Viajar a México como únicos representantes costarricenses al<strong> Festival Mundial de Coros</strong>! Este festival tiene su sede en Puebla, México y se llevará a cabo del 24 de Agosto al 1 de Setiembre.</p>
<p>La gira por México representa, para nuestro coro, la consolidación como colectivo artístico con calidad de exportación,  que tiene el objetivo primario de ser representación del joven talento costarricense a nivel mundial. El coro cuenta con 40 integrantes en total, de los cuales 32 formarán parte de la gira a México. Todos hemos hecho un gran esfuerzo personal para cubrir los gastos básicos del festival como lo son los tiquetes de avión y la inscripción al evento . <strong>¡Ahora te necesitamos!</strong></p>
<p>Un festival mundial exige que cada coro sea una representación de la idiosincrasia de cada país. Por ello, es de vital importancia la adquisición de un uniforme de gala que nos represente a todos nosotros como costarricenses.</p> <strong>¿Serás parte de nuestro sueño? </strong>

<h3>About the Album</h3>
<p>This is the beginning of the creation of my first full album, Human Nature. The songs of this album were inspired by the whole spectrum of experiences of being human, the Dark and the Light. The potential for great beauty and acts of selflessness, working for the greater good, and the ability to be cold-hearted, prejudiced and abusive to any part of the amazing creation, the Natural World, to fellow Earthlings. In each song, I express different aspects of this experience that I feel is both personal to my own life, as well as touching upon truths and feelings that are more universal; the confrontation of the imminence of Death and mortality, the falling away and returning to connection and intimacy with Nature, and the current state of personal and societal shadows that are desperately needing to be made conscious. These songs are deeply vulnerable for me to share, and I feel ready and willing to express these parts of my heart with you all in hopes that they touch similar places in your heart as well.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Call For Support</h3>
<p>I have roughly calculated as best as I can how much the totality of this project will cost, but I can not know right now what it will come out to at the end... It seems like it will be around $2000-$2500 for the recording, mixing, mastering of the album, the printing of CD's, custom made sweatshop-free T-shirts, hiring of artist for the album art, hiring of any musicians that I may feature on the album, etc... </p>
</div><div>
<h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<p>So, I have listed these perks for donations, all of which I feel have value and I have equated with donation amounts as to how I honestly feel they are worth. Any donations are greatly appreciated, but I absolutely understand that money is tight for a lot of you even if you want to support the album! You can always help out by sharing the link of the fundraiser on Social Media or privately with friends and family, or just send out some good vibes and love for this project! I appreciate it all and truly do not have any expectations from any of you... Thank you SO much for all your support for my music and our friendships. I feel so blessed to have such amazing friends, family and community in my life...</p>
<p>With Love and Gratitude,</p>

So, I have listed these perks for donations, all of which I feel have value and I have equated with donation amounts as to how I honestly feel they are worth. Any donations are greatly appreciated, but I absolutely understand that money is tight for a lot of you even if you want to support the album! You can always help out by sharing the link of the fundraiser on Social Media or privately with friends and family, or just send out some good vibes and love for this project! I appreciate it all and truly do not have any expectations from any of you... Thank you SO much for all your support for my music and our friendships. I feel so blessed to have such amazing friends, family and community in my life...

<p>The whole idea for the project began at my agent's 50th birthday party in Vienna, when I surprised him by putting on a dress and singing Mary Sunshine's song from ""Chicago."" All the guests at the party erupted and screamed with thunderous applause. The very next day, the idea for a full-length broadway CD was born. After all, when I was a child and before I even know what opera was, I was singing tons of broadway musicals. It's in my blood!</p>
<p>Recording a CD of this music with the countertenor voice I have developed and trained for many years is a dream for me, and I have something totally unique and special planned for you. In my career as an opera singer, I have a specialty in performing women's roles, so the idea came about quite naturally that I should bring this element to my CD. This is why I will be recording songs combining both male and female personas! Once the CD has been recorded and released, I have big ambitions for a special and unique concert tour with the repertoire from the CD.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>I will be recording a full-length CD. I need to cover all the expenses related to the production and release of a new album, which means payments for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-Production</li>
<li>Recording, mixing, and mastering</li>
<li>Our amazing pianist</li>
<li>Cover Artwork and Booklet design</li>
<li>Photos</li>
<li>Videos</li>
<li>Publicity</li>
</ul>
<p>BUT! My ambitions go beyond the CD. I want to spread BroadRAY! far and wide!My agency and myself are planning a LIVE tour of BroadRAY! Contributions beyond our initial goal will go toward publicity for the CD and concert tour.</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>Creating a masterpiece takes time, and I don't want to keep you waiting for the final CD! That's why I have already made a preview recording just for you with 4 songs! This Preview CD is available immediately and will be available EXCLUSIVELY to campaign contributors. </p>
<p>Some other fun things I have for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Photos</li>
<li>Autographs</li>

<h3>Why I'm doing this</h3>
<p>I want to create something special and wonderful for the world to enjoy. This idea has guided my career each step of the way. I have always accepted my voice and talents as gifts to nourish, protect, and share. That's why I work so hard. Quite simply, I want to make people happy!</p>

<p><strong>Opera on Tap - Wisconsin (formerly Opera on Tap - Milwaukee, or OOT-MKE)</strong>, an opera group who performs mostly in bars and restaurants, is bringing new things to the area.

<p>Other shows/operas our local chapter has produced include:</p>

<p>In order to make the show a success, the team is making decisions to keep the production affordable, WHICH IS WHERE YOU ALL COME IN!</p>

<p><strong>The amount mentioned in this campaign will help cover costume rental fees (cheerleader and football-player-influenced), minimal props, minimal set pieces, and cast and production team stipends.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>Let's Make Some Music</strong></h2>
<p>It's time to head back into the studio and recording some new music and we're excited to include you all in the process! We started this campaign to create a fun way for you, our fans, to be part of the action and to get some cool stuff in the process! Without all of you coming to our shows and spinning our records and wearing our hats and shirts - we simply wouldn't exist - so we want to say a very sincere thank you for being a fan. Check out how to get in on the action below...</p>
<h2><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h2>
<p>We know it might seem like magic how we just end up with music online and cds for sale and show up on stages around the country... but there's a lot of time and money that goes into the process! For example, there's renting the studio time, hiring a great engineer to capture all the sounds, getting the music mixed and mastered, gas, lodging, etc.</p>
<p>But what's in it for you?? Glad you asked... When you donate to this project, you get cool stuff back! Check out all the perks listed on this campaign and dive in at the level you're comfortable with!</p>
<h2><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h2>
<p>If you're not able to contribute with your bank account, there are definitely still some ways you can help us out. Simply sharing this on your Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter account helps us get the word out and helps us reach more fans.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">'I think you're really, really going to enjoy... the fantastic sound of Galileo's Fan' - Matt Graveling, <i><strong>Best of British Unsigned</strong></i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">'I think you'll agree, that's absolutely gorgeous... I'll look forward to hearing a lot more from them' - Diana Schad, <strong><i>BBC Radio Scotland</i></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">'I can't get this out of my head!' - <strong><i>Future Music Songwriting</i></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>Hello everyone and thank you very much for taking the time to look at our page.</p>
<p>We are siblings, Martin and Fi Vass, from Nairn in the Scottish highlands. We have been gigging for a number of years now and writing songs habitually for the entirety of our adult lives. Our music is our catharsis and comes from a place of sincere ardour.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">'This lady's voice just blew me away' - Elaine Lamb, <strong><i>Oban FM</i></strong></p>
<p>We began writing separately and would share our musings with one another whenever we had the chance to meet up and we soon discovered our mutual love for each others' songs. As close pals and allies (as well as brother and sister), we have supported each other through life's trials and tribulations and we feel very lucky to be able to now support one another in the story-telling of it. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">'Carefully crafted songs' - Toby Stainton, <strong><i>Inverness Gigs</i></strong></p>
<p>When we play for an audience, the thing that people comment on most is the strength of the familial/musical connection, especially in the vocal harmonies. When we perform as a trio with our brother, Mike Vass, the response is always the same. I suppose it is because we feel as connected to each others' songs as we do our own and that is clearly appreciated by listeners.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">'What a joy it is to hear siblings harmonise' - Neil McFadyen, <strong><i>Folk Radio UK</i></strong></p>
<p>We grew up playing and singing Scottish traditional music and songs (which provided a rich tapestry of stories and melodies to draw influence from) while listening to everything besides (We enjoyed a combination of Indie, pop, rock, electronic and everything in-between). </p>
<p>Moving with the rapid development of production techniques, our music has evolved into a full-bodied Indie-band sound, incorporating big, melody-rich choruses, with contrasting subtle electronic themes and textures. Fans have likened it to CHVRCHES, The Cranberries, Idlewild, Jimmy Eat World, London Grammar, Stereophonics and The Frames, to name a few.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">'Awesome. Simply awesome. Please! Please! Upload more tunes to <br/>XRP Radio. I personally love your music. Magic!' - David Campbell, <strong><i>XRP Radio</i></strong></p>
<p>We are lucky to have a strong team of professionals behind us, bringing our music to another level. Iain Hutchison is our producer at GloWorm Recording Studios in Glasgow, we have Louis Abbott (Admiral Fallow) on drums, Graeme Smillie (Chemikal Underground) on bass and Mike Vass on fiddle.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>What we need</strong></p>

'I think you're really, really going to enjoy... the fantastic sound of Galileo's Fan' - Matt Graveling, Best of British Unsigned
'I think you'll agree, that's absolutely gorgeous... I'll look forward to hearing a lot more from them' - Diana Schad, BBC Radio Scotland
'I can't get this out of my head!' - Future Music Songwriting
 
Hello everyone and thank you very much for taking the time to look at our page.
We are siblings, Martin and Fi Vass, from Nairn in the Scottish highlands. We have been gigging for a number of years now and writing songs habitually for the entirety of our adult lives. Our music is our catharsis and comes from a place of sincere ardour.
'This lady's voice just blew me away' - Elaine Lamb, Oban FM
We began writing separately and would share our musings with one another whenever we had the chance to meet up and we soon discovered our mutual love for each others' songs. As close pals and allies (as well as brother and sister), we have supported each other through life's trials and tribulations and we feel very lucky to be able to now support one another in the story-telling of it. 
'Carefully crafted songs' - Toby Stainton, Inverness Gigs
When we play for an audience, the thing that people comment on most is the strength of the familial/musical connection, especially in the vocal harmonies. When we perform as a trio with our brother, Mike Vass, the response is always the same. I suppose it is because we feel as connected to each others' songs as we do our own and that is clearly appreciated by listeners.
'What a joy it is to hear siblings harmonise' - Neil McFadyen, Folk Radio UK
We grew up playing and singing Scottish traditional music and songs (which provided a rich tapestry of stories and melodies to draw influence from) while listening to everything besides (We enjoyed a combination of Indie, pop, rock, electronic and everything in-between). 
Moving with the rapid development of production techniques, our music has evolved into a full-bodied Indie-band sound, incorporating big, melody-rich choruses, with contrasting subtle electronic themes and textures. Fans have likened it to CHVRCHES, The Cranberries, Idlewild, Jimmy Eat World, London Grammar, Stereophonics and The Frames, to name a few.
'Awesome. Simply awesome. Please! Please! Upload more tunes to XRP Radio. I personally love your music. Magic!' - David Campbell, XRP Radio
We are lucky to have a strong team of professionals behind us, bringing our music to another level. Iain Hutchison is our producer at GloWorm Recording Studios in Glasgow, we have Louis Abbott (Admiral Fallow) on drums, Graeme Smillie (Chemikal Underground) on bass and Mike Vass on fiddle.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey! Tim Carman here, </p>
<p>Some of you may know me as the drummer for the award winning soul singer <strong>Julie Rhodes</strong>, recently declared ""Female Vocalist of the Year,” and “Americana Artist of the Year"" in Boston. Others might know me as a drum teacher in Boston and Los Angeles, and author of the drum instruction book <strong>Shape Beats For Kids</strong>. You may have also seen me perform as the drummer for various artists like <strong>Christy Calabro</strong> (Brett Michaels, Poison), <strong>The Tokyo Tramps, All Talk, Sheldon and Cunnane</strong>, <strong>Violet Wine</strong>, <strong>Valley Shine</strong>, <strong>The Potluck Quartet, </strong><strong>Mother Jones</strong>, <strong>Roberto Hermosillo</strong>, <strong>Eric and the French Quarter,</strong> <strong>Nick Camillo, </strong><strong>Jake and the Infernal Machine, Tom's Folly</strong> and <strong>The Elizabeth Kill</strong>. But I’m hoping you’ll soon know me as the creator of the funk band Tim Carman and The Street 45s and composer of an original funk album. To step into this new role as composer and tackle this challenge of recording an original album, I am looking for support from amazing family and friends. I am hoping you can help me realize this dream and am confident you will be dancing to the finished product! After hundreds of hours of writing and tinkering, I currently have ten demos, have met with the producer, and am preparing to record this album…which is where you come in!</p>
<h3>Why I Need Your Help</h3>
</div><div>
<p>These ten demos have been years in the making and I want to give them the release they deserve, properly recorded in a state of the art studio and performed by some of Boston's most talented session musicians. </p>
<p><strong><u>Cost Breakdown</u></strong></p>
<p><u>Recording Fees</u>: Studio Time + Producer + Recording Engineer + Musicians  = $8,000</p>
<p><u>Post Production Fees</u>: Mixing/Mastering + Album Artwork + Manufacturing + Donation to ""Music and Youth"" + Indiegogo Fees = $4,000</p>
<p>Recording an album is an expensive endeavor and as an independent artist, you are my record label! With this campaign, I am asking you to be directly involved with the creation of Tim Carman &amp; The Street 45s<strong> </strong>and in turn you will receive some cool perks!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As a kid, I was extremely lucky to have the positive force of music in my life. That is why I want to use this fundraiser to also help support music development for kids in low-income areas in Boston. Five percent of all contributions that are $100 and above will go to the <strong>""Music and Youth""</strong> initiative! Find more here: <a href=""https://www.musicandyouth.org/music-and-youth-mission/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.musicandyouth.org/music-and-youth-m...</a></p>
<p>Additionally,Tim Carman &amp; The Street 45s  will highlight some of the incredible musical talent that already exists in the Boston area. For me, this is a family project.  Many songs will have guest artists on them such as <strong>Matthew Stubbs </strong> (Charlie Musselwhite, Matthew Stubbs and the Antiguas) and <strong>Justin Lopes </strong>(Barely Dead, Matthew Stubbs and the Antiguas). As a contributor, you can help spread this Boston based musical talent to more listeners across the country and the globe!</p>
<p>This project has been a dream of mine for well over a decade and I have finally gathered the courage to set the project in motion. I can't express how much your support means to me!</p>

<h3>About Our Project</h3>
<p>Music has always had a way of touching people in the most interesting of ways. For me, at the age of 15, I will always remember the feelings that came over me while watching a live concert on TV, and it was in that moment that I found my passion for music. I knew from that moment on that I wanted others to feel the same emotions I had felt while watching that concert, and I knew I wanted to do it with the music I would one day write. We all have similar stories and passions, but music happens to be ours.</p>
<p>Being first generation Iranian-American, I (Ashkan) have always felt strongly that I wanted to use my creation of art &amp; music as a means to help people. So, in our recent partnership with Preemptive Love Coalition we will be able to do that very thing as we donate 10% of all our future music sales, streams, merch sales, ticket sales and more as a means to help refugees &amp; asylum seekers get the aid, food, shelter, and surgeries they need so that they can rebuild their lives.</p>
<p>Help us release this album into the wild by joining us in our debut release, and know that by helping us fulfill our dreams, in return you are also helping refugee families in Syria, and Iraq rebuild their lives.</p>
<p>It's been 2 years in the making and we can't wait to share it with you.</p>
<p>Love,</p>
<p>Lone Wild</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Special Note for Early Birds (Before 50% Funding)</h3>
<p>Everyone who gives at the <strong>$10 level or more </strong>will receive:</p>
<ul>
<li>All our previous released music that is no longer available - <strong>15 Songs Total</strong>
</li>
<li>Unreleased Demos ONLY available to backers -<strong> Alternative song versions &amp; songs that didn't make the cut</strong>
</li>
<li>Early Bonus Track Releases as they come - <strong>roughly 4 tracks </strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Vision &amp; Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<i><strong>We will be donating 10% of all income from this campaign, future music sales, future music streams, merch sales and more to help refugees through our partnership with <a href=""http://preemptivelove.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Preemptive Love Coalition</a>.</strong></i> In helping us, we will be able to fulfill our vision of being a catalyst for change in the lives of others, while providing a platform for you to do the same. Preemptive Love Coalition helps bring aid, shelter, food, life-savings surgeries and so much more to refugees &amp; asylum seekers in Syria, Iraq, and the Middle East. <a href=""http://preemptivelove.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Read up more on them here!</a>
</li>
<li>Also, by helping us release this new music into the world you will be helping fulfill a life-long dream of a few musicians who want to create great music.</li>
<li>We intend to continue our partnership with Preemptive Love after this success of this project by continuing to donate a minimum of 10% of all income that comes to the band from live shows, ticket sales, merch sales, music sales &amp; streams and more.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We have spent a lot of time acquiring knowledge, buying studio equipment, recording at home, trading work for studio time, and by paying for the first half of this project out of our own pocket. We feel our decision to do this will set us up for success with future music releases. but we still need help!</li>
<li>We need <i><strong>at least $5,000</strong></i> to help cover the remaining costs of recording, mixing, mastering &amp; duplication costs of the record. This will allow us to release the new music excellently, fulfill our vision to aid our partnership with Preemptive Love (read on that above), and be able to fulfill the rewards we have decided on for you!</li>
<li>We put a ton of thought into the best ways we can reward you other than just getting a CD in the mail. So, outside of the music &amp; t-shirts, we have some really great ways to be apart of the creative process of future productions tied to this project, like being in a music video!</li>
<li>If we don't reach out entire goal, we'll look at what has come in to see if it's still possible to fulfill rewards. In the case that we cannot fund this project in its entirety, we'll get in touch with you as soon as possible to either refund your money or see how we can reward you if you decide you'd still like to be invested in this project!</li>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Releasing an album into the wild can often times be very financially taxing on a band, and recording music well requires the right equipment and sometimes hiring professionals that have spent their lives crafting the sonic qualities that make recorded music sound so pleasing.</p>
<p>To lower the number of costs that went into creating this new music &amp; future music, we purchased our own studio equipment for recording what we can at home without sacrificing quality. We have spent a lot of time acquiring knowledge, recording at home, trading work for studio time, and by paying for the first half of this project out of our own pocket. We feel our decision to do this will set us up for success with future music releases</p>
<p>In doing so we were able to get everything that WE could do on our own done, but now we just need your help to get the little bit that is left taken care of.</p>
<p>At this time, music is valued less and less due to streaming services like Spotify, Apple Music, and Youtube. Though they are great tools with getting your music around the world and into the ears of listeners who may have otherwise not known about you, these services are infamous for paying content creators (like musicians) historically low amounts of income for their hard work, making it very hard to continue to create art &amp; music of high quality.</p>
<p>Once we've completed this fundraiser we will be able to release our new music into the wild. We'll devote our efforts to delivering our rewards and begin the process of touring these songs we've worked so hard to create!</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Sometimes you just can't give financially, but you still want to help? GREAT! Here are a few ways to do that!</p>

Once we've completed this fundraiser we will be able to release our new music into the wild. We'll devote our efforts to delivering our rewards and begin the process of touring these songs we've worked so hard to create!

 
Other Ways You Can Help
Sometimes you just can't give financially, but you still want to help? GREAT! Here are a few ways to do that!
Share These Few Important Keys With Your Friends on Social Media!

Share what we're doing on your blog, vlog, or radio show
Share this campaign page & tag your friends that you think would be interested!
Share our mission of donating 10% of all that comes into this campaign, future music sales, future music streams and more to Preemptive Love Coalition, a non-profit providing aid, food, shelter, and life-saving surgeries to refugees in Syria & Iraq.
Share our weekly video updates about the success of the project with your friends & family.
Donate your skills or services that would help us fulfill our rewards: printing, screen printing, video making etc...

After it's funded, Help us in these ways as we release new music: 

Stream our songs to build a buzz & to build revenue for us to give to Preemptive Love. Every stream produces something, even if it's a little bit, a lot of streams can add up for some major impact and allow us to continue doing what we love while helping others along the way.
Take Videos of you listening to the music & we'll share it on our feed!
Share the music on your social avenues like Instagram stories, Facebook, Twitter, & Snapchat.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Pete Seeger’s image should be carved into Mount Rushmore.  That’s what Harry Belafonte once said, and he has a point.  Pete not only sang songs about our shared landscape, history, values and struggles, but he was the embodiment of the principles he sang about.  He was a mentor to thousands of musicians, activists and other citizens of Mother Earth.  Pete Seeger was the soul of American folk music and the conscience of the American ideal.</p>
<p>In recognition of Pete’s 100<sup>th</sup> birthday this May, 2019, I have recorded a collection of songs that profoundly impacted me over the ten years I knew Pete and the hundred or so times we met, performed together or talked on the phone.  Pete was a collector of wisdom.  His wisdom and philosophy are evident in his music and the way he lived his life.  And that is what this album will share with the world.</p>
<p>I didn’t know much about Pete before I met him in 2003.  But what happened the night before we met and the first two things Pete said to me made all the difference.   I will tell more about that in one of the “updates” on this site.</p>
<p>Now, 16 years later, having seen Pete's mission from the inside, I am touring throughout the United States and Canada sharing concerts with thousands of people who are helping to keep his tradition alive.  This new album is the next big step.  I think it will cast Pete in an even greater light than that in which many people already see him.  He was a beacon of hope and a spring of wisdom that we can continue to look to for guidance and sanity for many generations to come.</p>
<p>But I need your help.  It will take about $30,000 to get this CD into the hands of DJs, music media and music lover around the world.  We’ve already been in a state-of-the-art studio.  We’ve already done the graphics.  And we already have a limited number of advance copies printed and in our hands.  Most are going to DJs and music media, but some are available to you, today. </p>
<p>Now, we need get the CD into the hands of DJ’s all over the U.S. and Canada; get the rest of the CDs manufactured so they can be available for sale at concerts; pay for the studio time;  pay the musicians what they deserve, and take care of other expenses.  It’s a lot to ask, but if I we can raise half of the total cost in this campaign, we will be able to celebrate one more victory and continue doing our part to keep Pete’s music and legacy alive.</p>
<p>Every contribution moves us closer to our goal.  And we have some wonderful gifts for everyone that helps.  It's a way to thank you and to give you a piece of this worthy project so you can say, “I helped keep the flame alive.”  Please join us in honoring and celebrating Pete Seeger, his music and his gift to us all.  Thanks you!</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Hey everyone! My name is Sam Graham from Boston and I'm finally recording my debut EP of original music. </strong></p>
<p>I started my song-writing journey 4 years ago on the heels of my New England Conservatory education (the first time). After jumping from department to department, genre to genre, writing my own music was the first time I finally felt like I knew where I wanted to be as an artist. It was also an amazing coping mechanism when dealing with my first major heartbreak and first existential crisis. This collection of songs will bring the listener from the loss to new love that I've found.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The project is underway, but we still need your help reaching the finish line!</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>This campaign is to raise the rest of the funds I need to finish my professionally recorded EP with producer Alex Yen, a graduate of Berklee's Production and Engineering Master's Program. Together we are breathing new life into my music and shaping my own arrangements to bring out the best for the project.</strong></p>
<p>So far, we've begun recording and finished the rhythm section session. They sound amazing! While I've managed to begin the process through my own means, the cost of recording adds up quickly and I need <strong>YOUR </strong>help to finish. Your donations will help fund the following:</p>
<ul><li>
<strong>PRE-PRODUCTION: </strong>Magic happens before we even hit the studio. Pre-production covers rehearsals with musicians and producers to make sure everything sounds amazing and is ready for recording. This is where all the new and exciting ideas in the process come from.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<strong>RECORDING</strong>: We've already finished one piece of the puzzle, but still need to record horns, strings and vocals for the finished product. Studio time and engineering costs are the bulk of the budget and where most of your donations will go.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<strong>MIXING &amp; MASTERING: </strong>Once we have all the parts recorded, it's time to put them all together and begin the <i>long</i> process of making a finished product. We ""mix"" the levels of each instrument so that each one shines through. Mastering is the process where we take a step back and look at the whole product from beginning to end and make the sound as cohesive as possible.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<b>LICENSING AND DISTRIBUTION:</b> This registers my music under copyright and gets the music ready for online and physical distribution.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<strong>ARTISTIC COLLABORATORS: </strong>Producing the product goes beyond just the music. This covers principal photography as well as graphic designers who helped with merchandise and logos.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<strong>THE VIDEO:</strong> Pushing my artistry as far as possible, if I reach my goal of $5000, I will direct and produce a music video for my lead single ""Humming Song"". In a digital age where most media is consumed visually, this video will help tremendously in expanding the reach of my project to a larger audience.</li></ul>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>It might be ""on-brand"" for me to cry and whine about this project...</strong></p>
<p>...but your contribution would truly change my life. I've struggled a lot as a musician and whether I'm ""good"" enough to live up to the reputation of my school and my peers. I've also struggled with romance and put too much of my self-worth into how someone else sees me. This music is very personal to me and reflects a lot of my own demons, but also the joy and love I've found in myself and around me. I finally <i>feel</i> like I'm worth it. Working on this project has not only shown me how capable I am, but <i>who</i> I am as an artist. I hope that my story and music can help someone else feel the same way.</p>

After jumping from department to department, genre to genre, writing my own music was the first time I finally felt like I knew where I wanted to be as an artist. It was also an amazing coping mechanism when dealing with my first major heartbreak and first existential crisis. This collection of songs will bring the listener from the loss to new love that I've found.
The project is underway, but we still need your help reaching the finish line!
 


This campaign is to raise the rest of the funds I need to finish my professionally recorded EP with producer Alex Yen, a graduate of Berklee's Production and Engineering Master's Program. Together we are breathing new life into my music and shaping my own arrangements to bring out the best for the project.
So far, we've begun recording and finished the rhythm section session. They sound amazing! While I've managed to begin the process through my own means, the cost of recording adds up quickly and I need YOUR help to finish. Your donations will help fund the following:

PRE-PRODUCTION: Magic happens before we even hit the studio. Pre-production covers rehearsals with musicians and producers to make sure everything sounds amazing and is ready for recording. This is where all the new and exciting ideas in the process come from.
 

RECORDING: We've already finished one piece of the puzzle, but still need to record horns, strings and vocals for the finished product. Studio time and engineering costs are the bulk of the budget and where most of your donations will go.
 

MIXING & MASTERING: Once we have all the parts recorded, it's time to put them all together and begin the long process of making a finished product. We ""mix"" the levels of each instrument so that each one shines through. Mastering is the process where we take a step back and look at the whole product from beginning to end and make the sound as cohesive as possible.
 

LICENSING AND DISTRIBUTION: This registers my music under copyright and gets the music ready for online and physical distribution.
 

ARTISTIC COLLABORATORS: Producing the product goes beyond just the music. This covers principal photography as well as graphic designers who helped with merchandise and logos.
 

THE VIDEO: Pushing my artistry as far as possible, if I reach my goal of $5000, I will direct and produce a music video for my lead single ""Humming Song"". In a digital age where most media is consumed visually, this video will help tremendously in expanding the reach of my project to a larger audience.
 

DON'T THINK YOU'RE LEAVING HERE EMPTY HANDED!
Perks for the project include:

Pins
Stickers
T-Shirts
Comp Tickets
Custom Cover Songs
Private Live Performances

***Every donation of $25 or more will receive a personalized postcard with a handwritten thank you from Sam. Donations of $10 or less will receive an emailed thank you.***
(My mother will be so proud. We take Thank-You letters very seriously...)
 

It might be ""on-brand"" for me to cry and whine about this project...
...but your contribution would truly change my life. I've struggled a lot as a musician and whether I'm ""good"" enough to live up to the reputation of my school and my peers. I've also struggled with romance and put too much of my self-worth into how someone else sees me. This music is very personal to me and reflects a lot of my own demons, but also the joy and love I've found in myself and around me. I finally feel like I'm worth it. Working on this project has not only shown me how capable I am, but who I am as an artist. I hope that my story and music can help someone else feel the same way.
 
I'm a good horse to bet on having already won two competitive grants while at New England Conservatory: The $500 “Spark” Grant Award to launch this album, as well as NEC’s $1,500 ""Entrepreneurial Musician Grant"" to direct, produce and star in a same-sex rendition of Jason Robert Brown’s “The Last 5 Years”, benefitting the local Boston nonprofit BAGLY to support LGBTQ+ youths.
 

If you're ready to donate, head to the ""BACK IT"" button at the top right. Anything you can contribute will get me one step closer to my goal!
If you want to help more, PLEASE share this campaign on your social media with the share buttons on the page. 
Thank you so much for checking out my IndieGoGo. I'm so excited to share this with you!",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Denarii Grace. I'm a blues singer-songwriter, poet, freelance writer and editor, aspiring screenwriter, public speaker/educator, and long time activist. I'm a brown-skinned, Black, bisexual, multiply disabled, proudly fat, poor, femme woman.</p>
<p>When I was a little girl, before elementary school, I always used to tell people that I wanted to be a singer. At around 11 or 12, I knew that my stage name would be ""Denarii Grace"" - my first and middle names. I even had what I thought was a fancy way of signing autographs: print text my first name and the ""g"" and ""r"" of my middle name, then write ""ace"" in cursive - because some how calling myself an ""ace"" was cool - don't ask.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the way, I gave up that dream. As far as I was concerned, that was all it was - a dream. I grew up poor and I needed to pick a practical, stable, secure career path. So I gave up the thought of living life as an artist and opted to attend college to major in English, with the intention of becoming a high school English teacher (which, for the record, I also really wanted to do). In addition, as I got older, I began to doubt my musical gifts. I started comparing my vocal ability to others and feeling inadequate. Those fears stopped me - for a LONG time.</p>
<p>But I believe that this is what I've been called to do, life has lead me right back to where I once lived - in music, in the arts - and I plan to stay here, with your help and support.</p>
<p>I've been through a lot - experienced a lot, felt a lot, grown a lot, learned and unlearned a lot - and it shows through the work that I create. And I want to share those experiences, those hopes, those dreams, those beautiful, painful, joyful, empowering words, with as many people as possible. And you can help me get there.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Initially, when I decided I'd start a crowdfunding campaign, my goal was going to be $5,000. But then I thought it'd probably be best to really think about what I'll need to get done and who will need to be paid so that I don't underestimate how much I'll need to raise.</p>
<p>There is a lot that goes into making a record, whether it's an EP or a full album - especially one's IDEAL record. Like many artists, I'm a perfectionist - I want to work with good quality studios and engineers, good quality indie musicians, good quality EVERYTHING. At the end of the day, the work I put out reflects on ME. And doing that costs money.</p>
<p>So here's a rough breakdown of what the money I raise will go to, and how I got to a whopping goal of $25,000 (note that that figure factors in the fees that IndieGogo and the payout company charge me). I'm still working out the kinks and, again, some  of these numbers are guesstimates based on past experience but:</p>
<p>$2000 - studio time, including Lyft* transportation to and from studio</p>
<p>$500 - rough estimate to copyright the seven original works that will appear on “POWER” EP via Legal Zoom</p>
<p>$1485 - Txlips quoted fee for recording three of the seven songs with me (includes cost of recording at ATL studio, where they're based)</p>
<p>$X - [unnamed indie rapper] fee for recording</p>
<p>$6,000 - total for all other session musician/background singer fees</p>
<p>$500 - professional mixing costs</p>
<p>$200 - get CDs pressed and made (yes there will be physical copies, not just digital yay!)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>$250 - roundtrip flight to ATL to record with Txlips</p>
<p>$600 - 5 day/4 night stay in ATL</p>
<p>$150 - ATL transportation (Lyft*)</p> <p>$500 to $1,000 - photographer fee for “POWER” EP cover photoshoot at Jones Beach</p>
<p>$10 - roundtrip public transit travel to Jones Beach</p> <p>$400 - roundtrip flight to Bay area to record with [unnamed indie rapper]</p>
<p>$750 - 5 day/4 night stay at Courtyard Marriot Oakland Emeryville</p>
<p>$250 - Oakland transportation (Lyft)</p> <p>$5,000 - promo/ad costs</p>
<p>Those are the basics, plus, since I don't have a ""traditional"" job, I'll also need funds to...yanno, eat and pay bills and take care of my pets during this process. In addition, I wanted a buffer since I don't yet know how much the rapper will charge AND, at the end of the day, I'm new to this process and there may be steps that I'm missing or I may be underestimating the costs of some pieces to this puzzle. Between that and factoring in the IndieGogo fees, that's how I came to the $25,000 goal.</p>
<p>I believe that artists deserve to be compensated FAIRLY for our work, so I took into consideration things like industry standards for session musician rates as well as talking to/knowing people who work in these professions and what their general rates are in order to roughly calculate how much things will cost. In addition, I based things like hotel and flight costs on my past experiences (I fly Delta).</p>
<p>I'm not really sure what you'll get. I have a Patreon and I've found that trying to create ""reward levels"" that make sense and also aren't super taxing when I already have a lot of work to do (the above is just the tip of the iceberg) is hard for me. So, if possible, I'd rather hear what YOU'D like to see. I can certainly do behind-the-scenes and ""first listen"" stuff, but beyond that, I have no earthly idea of what I'm doing, LOL, so please help with that.</p>
<p>My hope is that, more than anything, folks just want to support a proudly fat, Black, multiply disabled, poor, bisexual, femme woman trying to bring something at once both different and familiar to the scene, just trying to make good, powerful, empowering music. My hope is that people care enough about those of us who are less likely to make it in this industry that you'll do what you can to help make my dream come true. And the best part is, because I believe in compensating artists fairly, your contribution would not only help ME, but by extension will also help other multiply marginalized artists with whom I plan to work to get paid so THEY in turn can eat, add to their resumes, and in turn continue with their dreams.</p>
<p>* I am physically disabled with chronic pain and I find that sometimes it's easier for me to travel via Lyft instead of taking public transit, which is usually cheaper (especially with longer distances). I will take public transit when I'm capable of doing so, but it's not always possible, especially in places I'm not familiar with, so I factor that higher cost into my calculations.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In addition to the above, one of the most important impacts - for me - is based on what I've already experienced. Whether it's my poetry, my workshops, my public speaking, or - now - my music, my entire life (but increasingly these days) has been filled with comments from folks talking about how my work has affected their lives for the better. It's mindblowing and humbling and powerful and moving to have people come up to you and ask for an autograph - little old ""nobody"" me - and all I want is to increase that impact, to help folks unlearn, as I have, to help heal, to empower my communities, and to give people strength and love.</p>
<p>And because I don't come from money, because I'm a full-time artist, I don't have the money to do it on my own. So I need to connect with folks who share my values, who want to see more diversity (of both artists and the art that we make) in music, in the hopes that our shared values will move you to contribute. Even if you can't afford to give at the time that you stumble upon this, you can still share the SHIT out of this campaign.</p>
<p>Hey, for all you know, the work I create might just influence and inspire YOU.</p>

<p><strong>God Still Has Soldiers</strong></p>
<p>A soldier is someone who eagerly desires to be the hands and feet of Jesus. A soldier desires to see communities filled with hope, schools revamped with an everlasting truth, and cities unified. With everything that's taken place in our world, the need for soldiers is greater than it's ever been. Our generation needs young world-changers, impacters, and difference makers. Our heartbeat is to be leaders of that movement.</p>
<p>We launched Bold Records in 2014 with a passion for people and a love for Jesus. After assembling a small team, we traveled from state to state proclaiming truth through music and we witnessed God do immeasurably more. </p>
<p>Our organization has grown and so has our needs. With your help we are able to continue to create and distribute high quality resources, hire extra help to facilitate and execute campaigns, fund outreach opportunities, tours, and album releases. </p>
<p>We are excited to continue in our mission of taking the message of hope to new cities and states all throughout the nation. We are passionate about engaging youth. <strong>Engaged youth take action. </strong>Help us continue to reach this generation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Without God everything else is meaningless, therefore:</p>

A soldier is someone who eagerly desires to be the hands and feet of Jesus. A soldier desires to see communities filled with hope, schools revamped with an everlasting truth, and cities unified. With everything that's taken place in our world, the need for soldiers is greater than it's ever been. Our generation needs young world-changers, impacters, and difference makers. Our heartbeat is to be leaders of that movement.
We launched Bold Records in 2014 with a passion for people and a love for Jesus. After assembling a small team, we traveled from state to state proclaiming truth through music and we witnessed God do immeasurably more. 
Our organization has grown and so has our needs. With your help we are able to continue to create and distribute high quality resources, hire extra help to facilitate and execute campaigns, fund outreach opportunities, tours, and album releases. 
We are excited to continue in our mission of taking the message of hope to new cities and states all throughout the nation. We are passionate about engaging youth. Engaged youth take action. Help us continue to reach this generation.
 
Other Ways You Can Help
Without God everything else is meaningless, therefore:
Pray that God works through this process, and that His grace covers us as we move forward to taking the necessary steps towards reaching His people.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Hi, we are Red Convertible Recording (producers/engineers, Ricky Berotti and Kieran O'Leary), and we have recently taken over the original Studio G in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. We're so excited to bring fresh creativity and mind-bending sonics to musicians and listeners alike, but in order to do that, we need to revitalize the space and return the studio to its original glory and then some!</p>
<p>The original Studio G, founded by Tony Maimone and Joel Hamilton, is rich with musical history and significance.  From its early days, the studio has seen iconic artists and bands including, The Black Keys, Mos Def, Jim Jones, Q-Tip, Sparklehorse, and Black Francis from The Pixies. Our mission is to revive the space and restore it to its former preeminence. We’re asking for your support in raising $20,000 to both enliven the studio and build a space for artists to grow and create.  </p>
<p>To give you a little background, we began producing bands in 2016 in a tiny cement box studio on Meserole Street in Brooklyn. We worked full time jobs tirelessly in order to fund our musical careers and afford all of the essential gear that we used to record our own music and others. Ten-hour workdays followed by six-hour recording sessions became the staple of our existence for years and allowed us to share our creativity with those who worked with us. However, now that our early twenties have come and gone, we feel it is time to devote our entire lives to what we’re most passionate about.</p>
<p>Running a studio is no joke. Luckily, we have taken the advice of those who have come before us and want to ensure we have enough operating capital, gear, and experience to become one of Brooklyn’s hippest and most sought after studios.</p>
<p>Our dedication to recording and mixing is like no other.  As musicians, currently creating work in our own band, The Post Nobles, we know what it’s like to have a less than stellar studio experience.  We also know what it’s like to have an obsessive drive to make music that feels absolutely perfect.  Considering the sheer volume of new music being released, we know it’s not easy to stand out in the crowd.  Our mission is to create sounds and sonic landscapes that no one has ever heard before and to give our clients the attention to detail and professional experience that they wouldn’t necessarily receive in a larger scale environment. If the artist isn’t happy with how their song sounds, then neither are we. We will continue to work with an artist until their vision is met; nothing less will come from RCR.</p>
<p>In order to provide this kind of experience for musicians, we need to revamp the original Studio G and breathe new life into the space. Our goal is to offer artists a unique experience without the high price tag of typical NYC studios. Though our space is almost complete with an incredible live room, control room, echo chamber, and amp booth, we are looking to renovate the majority of the control room, build a vocal booth, and procure more gear to ensure that nothing is more than a chair-swivel away! In order to accomplish this, we need YOUR help!</p>
<p>Donating to our campaign will allow you to buy exclusive merch, give you access to live acoustic concerts from some of Brooklyn’s hottest bands, half priced studio days, and other sweet perks that you will love! What’s more important though, is that your donation will be a stepping-stone in providing a space in which creative energy can build on itself. Artists who may not ordinarily have the opportunity will be able to thrive in our studio, a space in which they have the freedom to completely express themselves and grow creatively.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Tambores del Pueblo is a Puerto Rican folkloric music ensemble based in Austin, TX. Its members come from diverse backgrounds but all have strong ties to the island. Playing together consistently for the past year, Tambores del Pueblo has developed a large repertoire of bombas, plenas, seises, and aguinaldos, and it is now time to record some of that material. <strong>The goal is to record an EP of 5 original songs</strong> in order to get our music out to the world. The funds raised from this campaign will go directly to the costs of producing a professional quality recording.  Although Tambores del Pueblo is rooted in traditions, the group is also hoping to push this music forward into the 21st century.  </li>

<p><strong>About Puerto Rican music</strong></p>

Tambores del Pueblo is a Puerto Rican folkloric music ensemble based in Austin, TX. Its members come from diverse backgrounds but all have strong ties to the island. Playing together consistently for the past year, Tambores del Pueblo has developed a large repertoire of bombas, plenas, seises, and aguinaldos, and it is now time to record some of that material. The goal is to record an EP of 5 original songs in order to get our music out to the world. The funds raised from this campaign will go directly to the costs of producing a professional quality recording.  Although Tambores del Pueblo is rooted in traditions, the group is also hoping to push this music forward into the 21st century.

About Puerto Rican music
You may ask, what is bomba?
Bomba is an Afro-Puerto Rican style of dance music that originated in areas along the coast. It is characterized by the interplay between vocalists, percussionists, and dancers. The ensemble consists of 2+ large barrel drums (known as barriles), the cuá (a special type of barril that is played on the shell of the drum with sticks), and a large maraca. There are several rhythms found in bomba music including the sicá, yubá, and holandés.
What is plena?
Plena is another Afro-Puerto Rican style that developed initially in Ponce over a century ago. Plena is typically played with panderetas (frame drums), güiro, and possibly cuatro, guitar, and/or bass.
Seis and aguinaldo?
Seises and aguinaldos form the core of the música jibara or música típica repertoire. This music comes from the mountains of Puerto Rico and is associated with Christmas, even though it is played all year round. Each town in Puerto Rico is said to have its own version style of seis or aguinaldo (i.e. seis bayamonés, aguinaldo orocoveño). The ensemble often includes cuatros, guitars, and güiro.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Lauren Teel. I am 19 years old and an Audio Production major at Middle Tennesse State University. I grew up in North Texas and am a country singer/songwriter and musician. I play guitar, piano, ukulele, and am trying to learn the banjo. I am currently unsigned and have decided to release my first album which includes 14 self-written tracks. This campaign is to launch my merchandise for my brand. I have poured almost all of the extra money I had after paying for food, gas, and other college necessities, on creating my album and still have more to pay in order to get it out there. This campaign is so that I can produce my first album and start selling merchandise after my music is released which will give me a huge boost in starting up my country music career.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>There are 14 songs in total on the album. Since tracking/recording is $65 an hour, mixing is $125 per song, and mastering is $100 per song, it adds up to about $6K, not to mention paying the session musicians (drummer, bassist, banjoist), which all comes out to about another $6K since professional musicians charge around $40-50 an hour. When it comes to the merchandise, since it is much cheaper to buy things in bulk, the remainder of the money after hitting $12K will go to buying the actual custom-designed products that I will be selling on my website. Each person who donates at least $50 will get discount codes to use during checkout at <a href=""http://www.laurenteel.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.laurenteel.com</a>.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Ever since I was a little girl, I've always wanted to make an impact with my music and to write songs that people can relate to. Taking the next step with the production of my first album and merchandise will help me build and grow my fan-base. Your contributions, no matter how small will make a huge difference in my life and the lives of those who just might hear my music one day.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There could be price changes when it comes to the websites that I will be using to create my merchandise. If that happens I will be glad to cover the difference.</p>

<p>Hello my friends,</p>
<p>I’m <a href=""https://www.leonaxrocks.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Leona X.</a>  I’m a songwriter, singer, and lead guitarist based in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>My greatest passion is songwriting, and through it, I want to spread a message of love, compassion, and equality for all species, and for our beautiful planet.</p>
<p>Recently , I experienced something incredible.  A spiritual awakening that changed my life and made me look at things so differently, right when I needed it the most.</p>
<p>Over the last year I lost my mother, my beloved cat, and couple years ago I found my biological father, only to find that I was too late. He passed away in 2013, never knowing about me, and I was his only child.  It broke my heart. I had looked for him for a big part of my life, and I finally found him,  too late.  I experienced so much loss all at once. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1580283728/vguuhnleuwedjw0jq86e.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>But the silver lining is that, out of all of that came an amazing song.  I really feel like it’s my best work ever.  It really came from my heart, more than any other song I have ever written.  I’ve never done or felt anything like this.  I poured all my heart and soul into this song.  Everything I was going through, including finally starting to love myself for the first time. It’s all in there. </p>
<p>“I’m Alive” came to me all at once, on a very magical night, 3 days before my beloved cat, Ebby, crossed over.  The veterinarian gave me the grim news that she wouldn’t make it through the week.  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1580283489/lybnn7rie6u8utotqzqw.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>That night, on November 12th, 2019, it was a Full Taurus Moon. I went into my music room, and everything I was feeling and going through just flowed out of me so easily.  I could actually feel the power of the moon and the universe working through me.  It was indescribable. I just let the feeling overtake me. </p>
<p>Three days later Ebby crossed over.  I then wrote the intro to the song and called it”’Til We Meet Again”. </p>
<p>“I’m Alive” was recorded during the Full Lunar Eclipse, also know as the Full Wolf Moon, on January 10th 2020.  I’ll never forget walking outside of the studio and looking up at the sky, and it was absolutely amazing, you guys!  And there was magic flowing through that room!</p>
<p>This song means more to me than any other one I’ve written. It's everything I imagined and more.  The release date will be March 9th 2020, on the day of the Super Full Worm Moon.  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1580284043/jjkipyhrs7ku2hyvmark.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>

<p>Now, I want, so much, to make a video to go with it.  I have such a huge vision, with a sincere message of hope. </p>
<p>This song gives hope to all that have loved and lost, and, to me, personally, it’s a testament to the incredible power of Mother Nature, and the oneness between us and the universe.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1580284125/w0ntedy2shhok7vmzinz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>All I want, more than anything, is to make this creation in my head become a reality to share with the whole world!</p>
<p>You can be a part of making it happen, my friends.  It’s all up to us.  There is no record label.</p>
<p>With your contribution we can make it happen.</p>
<p>Let’s come together and spread a rocking message of love and compassion for all.</p>
<p>Friends, please know how grateful I am for your continued love and support.  </p>
<p>It’s people like you who make a difference.  </p>
<p>Together, we can do this…</p>
<p>Love always, Leona XOXO</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Friends, I need at least $2,000 to make a quality music video.  </p>
<p>To make a video there's a cost for everything.  Some of these things are;</p>
<p>Location Costs - Some places require a permit.  My dream is to film at either Mount Charleston, where I had the video shoot, or at Spirit Mountain.  Since this song is about the power of Mother Nature, it has to be at one of these places.</p>
<p>Travel - We need to rent a U Haul truck to transport all off our equipment to the location.</p>
<p>Videographers - We need at least three crew members to film.</p>
<p>Musicians - I have to pay them to work for the day.</p>
<p>Dancers - I need at least 4 dancers.</p>
<p>Costumes - For me, I need at least three different ones, and for the dancers as well.  They are very expensive.</p>
<p>Props - I haven't decided which ones to use, I'm still figuring that out.</p>
<p>B Role Footage - Stock video, and special effects.</p>
<p>Editing &amp; Post Production - This is where the big money and time is spent.</p>
<p>Advertising - No one will watch or buy anything they don't know about, so there will always be promotional and marketing expenses for everything.</p>
<p>PERKS:</p>
<p>Since I will be putting this out before the release date, YOU will be one of the first to hear it, and receive a digital download of the song (with a donation) before it goes public.  </p>
<p>I will also make personal, behind the scenes, in the making, video footage, special, just for you.</p>
<p>Plus signed photos and posters of the cover art for ""I'm Alive"", and of the pictures that are taken at the shoot.</p>
<p>Signed copies of my last EP, ""The Woman In Me"", and many more personalized perks!</p>
<p>The biggest perk of all will be joining me , as a guest, to the video shoot!!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>""I'm Alive"" gives hope to all that have loved and lost.  I want to spread a message that the world needs to hear.  We all lose people and pets that we love, and it hurts so much.  Life and death happens.  Like I explained above, I lost so much, but being able to channel all of my feelings into this song was such great therapy for me.  It really helped me to grieve and heal.  It is my hope that it will do the same for others.  Anyone who has experienced loss will feel transcended with this song, and somehow be able to relate, realizing that we are all ONE with the universe.  We are all worthy of love.  ALL lives matter.  We are all connected to everything, the sky, the heavens, the water, and the earth.  Because of this, when someone you love crosses over, you can literally feel them ""everywhere, all around"". </p>
<p>This song will uplift you and make you feel Alive!  The light is within ourselves!</p>
<p>My last Ep, ""The Woman in Me"", was made possible by all of YOU, and I am eternally grateful.</p>
<p>Since then, I have grown so much, as a person, as a singer, a guitarist, and in every way.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>$2,000 will make filming a video happen.  Bottom line is, the more we raise, the better quality, more intense, and more visual it will become.</p>
<p>If we don't meet the goal, I'll still make a video the best I can.  If we go above the goal it means we won't need to cut so many corners.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute, monetarily, here are some of the ways you can still help:</p>
<p>1.)  SHARE, SHARE, SHARE! On Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, email, text, phone, etc.</p>
<p>       Use the Indiegogo share tools!</p>
</div><p>2.)  VOLUNTEER - On the day of the shoot we will need:</p><p>        Photographers - to document the day with photos and for the special perks.</p><p>        Transportation - We can save money by not having to rent a truck</p><p>        Loading - Help loading equipment is super helpful!</p><p>        Hair and Makeup - I could really use assistance with this, because I will need fresh ups and   someone to always be checking for out of place hair and messed up makeup, especially since we are dealing with the outdoors and Mother Nature.  Also assist with wardrobe, changing, insure against malfunctions, etc.</p><p>        Food and Drinks - We will need nourishment , someone to bring portable snacks and make sure we are all well hydrated.</p><p>        Help with emails - Sharing this campaign with your friends will help us to reach our goal.  Also, sharing the release Press to bloggers, vloggers, YouTubers, newspapers, magazines, etc., will make such a HUGE impact on the success of the single!!</p><p>       Props - If you have anything we can use, like swords, medieval costumes, anything magical looking, or that's to do with nature etc., that's what we're doing!</p><p>       Media - If you have any skills like, photoshopping, editing, graphic design, B roll footage, special effects, etc., THAT would be AMAZING!!</p><p> </p><p>Okay!  So I think that is it for now.  I will be sure to post updates on our progress.</p><p>Let's make a badass rock video!!  XOXO</p></div>","Hello my friends,

This song gives hope to all that have loved and lost, and, to me, personally, it’s a testament to the incredible power of Mother Nature, and the oneness between us and the universe.  

All I want, more than anything, is to make this creation in my head become a reality to share with the whole world!
You can be a part of making it happen, my friends.  It’s all up to us.  There is no record label.
With your contribution we can make it happen.
Let’s come together and spread a rocking message of love and compassion for all.
Friends, please know how grateful I am for your continued love and support.  
It’s people like you who make a difference.  
Together, we can do this…
Love always, Leona XOXO

What We Need & What You Get
 
Friends, I need at least $2,000 to make a quality music video.  
To make a video there's a cost for everything.  Some of these things are;
Location Costs - Some places require a permit.  My dream is to film at either Mount Charleston, where I had the video shoot, or at Spirit Mountain.  Since this song is about the power of Mother Nature, it has to be at one of these places.
Travel - We need to rent a U Haul truck to transport all off our equipment to the location.
Videographers - We need at least three crew members to film.
Musicians - I have to pay them to work for the day.
Dancers - I need at least 4 dancers.
Costumes - For me, I need at least three different ones, and for the dancers as well.  They are very expensive.
Props - I haven't decided which ones to use, I'm still figuring that out.
B Role Footage - Stock video, and special effects.
Editing & Post Production - This is where the big money and time is spent.
Advertising - No one will watch or buy anything they don't know about, so there will always be promotional and marketing expenses for everything.
PERKS:
Since I will be putting this out before the release date, YOU will be one of the first to hear it, and receive a digital download of the song (with a donation) before it goes public.  
I will also make personal, behind the scenes, in the making, video footage, special, just for you.
Plus signed photos and posters of the cover art for ""I'm Alive"", and of the pictures that are taken at the shoot.
Signed copies of my last EP, ""The Woman In Me"", and many more personalized perks!
The biggest perk of all will be joining me , as a guest, to the video shoot!!
 

The Impact
""I'm Alive"" gives hope to all that have loved and lost.  I want to spread a message that the world needs to hear.  We all lose people and pets that we love, and it hurts so much.  Life and death happens.  Like I explained above, I lost so much, but being able to channel all of my feelings into this song was such great therapy for me.  It really helped me to grieve and heal.  It is my hope that it will do the same for others.  Anyone who has experienced loss will feel transcended with this song, and somehow be able to relate, realizing that we are all ONE with the universe.  We are all worthy of love.  ALL lives matter.  We are all connected to everything, the sky, the heavens, the water, and the earth.  Because of this, when someone you love crosses over, you can literally feel them ""everywhere, all around"". 
This song will uplift you and make you feel Alive!  The light is within ourselves!
My last Ep, ""The Woman in Me"", was made possible by all of YOU, and I am eternally grateful.
Since then, I have grown so much, as a person, as a singer, a guitarist, and in every way.
 

Risks & Challenges
$2,000 will make filming a video happen.  Bottom line is, the more we raise, the better quality, more intense, and more visual it will become.
If we don't meet the goal, I'll still make a video the best I can.  If we go above the goal it means we won't need to cut so many corners.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't contribute, monetarily, here are some of the ways you can still help:
1.)  SHARE, SHARE, SHARE! On Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, email, text, phone, etc.
       Use the Indiegogo share tools!
2.)  VOLUNTEER - On the day of the shoot we will need:        Photographers - to document the day with photos and for the special perks.        Transportation - We can save money by not having to rent a truck        Loading - Help loading equipment is super helpful!        Hair and Makeup - I could really use assistance with this, because I will need fresh ups and   someone to always be checking for out of place hair and messed up makeup, especially since we are dealing with the outdoors and Mother Nature.  Also assist with wardrobe, changing, insure against malfunctions, etc.        Food and Drinks - We will need nourishment , someone to bring portable snacks and make sure we are all well hydrated.        Help with emails - Sharing this campaign with your friends will help us to reach our goal.  Also, sharing the release Press to bloggers, vloggers, YouTubers, newspapers, magazines, etc., will make such a HUGE impact on the success of the single!!       Props - If you have anything we can use, like swords, medieval costumes, anything magical looking, or that's to do with nature etc., that's what we're doing!       Media - If you have any skills like, photoshopping, editing, graphic design, B roll footage, special effects, etc., THAT would be AMAZING!! Okay!  So I think that is it for now.  I will be sure to post updates on our progress.Let's make a badass rock video!!  XOXO",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><i>For eight years (2012), at the <strong>Sanctuary</strong>, the in-house band <strong>AMBO</strong> has offered every friday, saturday and sunday evenings, Rock and Blues concerts to the beninese public.

<p><i><strong>AMBO </strong>is composed of young artists brought together and trained by its founding artistic director who can count on the input of many guest-musicians. So far, the <strong>Sanctuary </strong><i>has coached</i> three young bands, more than twenty musicians, allowing them to master over 500 titles. Their constantly evolving repertoire ranges from Blues (Robert Johnson, John Lee Hooker, Muddy Waters, B.B. King …), Rhythm &amp;  Blues/Soul (Ray Charles, James Brown, Stevie Wonder, Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding...),  Rock/Pop (Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, Michael Jackson, Prince, Deep Purple, Eric Clapton, the Eagles…)  without forgetting Afropop (Angelique Kidjo, Salif Keita, Khadja Nin, Myriam Makeba…), Reggae and Zouk (Bob Marley, Alpha Blondy, Kassav...), and french artists (Nougaro, Jonasz, Patricia Kaas, Edith Piaf, Johnny Halliday...). </i></p>

Le <strong>Sanctuary</strong> est avant tout une académie!</p>
<p>Le groupe <strong>AMBO</strong> est composé de musiciens assemblés et formés par le directeur artistique qui l'a créé, en s'appuyant souvent sur des musiciens invités. À ce jour, le <strong>Sanctuary</strong> a coaché 3 groupes, soit plus d'une vingtaine de musiciens,  ce qui leur a permis de maîtriser un vaste répertoire (plus de 500 titres !!!). Ce répertoire, en constante évolution, va du Blues (Robert Johnson, John Lee Hooker, Muddy Waters, BB King…), Rhythm &amp; Blues / Soul (Ray Charles, James Brown, Stevie Wonder, Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding ... ) au Rock et à la Pop (Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, Michael Jackson, Prince, Deep Purple, Eric Clapton, the Eagles…) sans oublier l’Afropop (Angelique Kidjo, Salif Keita, Khadja Nin, Myriam Makeba…), le Reggae et le Zouk ( Bob Marley, Alpha Blondy, Kassav ...) et les artistes français (Nougaro, Jonasz, Patricia Kaas, Edith Piaf, Johnny Halliday...).</p>

<h3>THIS PROJECT MUST BE POSTPONED DUE TO UNFORESEE CIRCUMSTANCES. PLEASE LOOK FOR RELAUNCH SPRING OF 2021.</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>About ""The Death and Life of Aida Hernandez"" Commission</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Aida Hernandez was an undocumented teenage mother who was deported to Mexico and had to combat a militarized U.S. immigration system if she was to have any hope of reuniting with her son. Her story, told in the book, “The Death and Life of Aida Hernandez,” challenges us to confront our laws and practices and the impacts they have on the lives of our neighbors.</p>
<p>I invite you to join me in telling Aida’s story through song in a new choral work for SSAA choir. Together, we can amplify her voice and help others (and ourselves) better understand the struggles of undocumented women and children and take action to change our world for the better.</p>
<p>My name is Michael. I am a composer of choral music. I love collaborating with others and seeing the light within them shine. My passion is to elevate the stories that I believe, when heard, can make our world a better place. It’s my way of fixing things, both in the world around me and within me.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>To do Aida’s story justice, I am writing a 15-minute, multi-movement work for SSAA choir. Composing a brand-new work is exciting, but it takes many hours of work.</p>
<p>My goal is to raise $10,000, which will allow me to set aside the time to write, edit, and engrave the piece, to hire a pianist to record rehearsal tracks for each part, and to create movement videos that demonstrate the phrasing of the piece. This will also allow me to edit footage from virtual choir members (you!) to create the final product that will be shared and delivered to you.</p>
<p>Finally, 10% of the funds raised will be donated to the nonprofit organization No More Deaths, whose mission is to end death and suffering in the Mexico-US borderlands through civil initiative: people of conscience working openly and in community to uphold fundamental human rights. </p>
<p>So I need your help.</p>
<p>You can join me as a major commissioning choir, an individual singer, or as a non-singing book club partner. At each of these levels, you can amplify Aida’s story, bring a new piece of music to life, and make a difference in your community, our nation, and the world.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>As we look around at our country and our world, it is clear that there are many challenges we must address. It can be hard to know where to begin, or if our efforts will really make a difference.</p>
<p>What I’ve learned from my years of writing choral music with a social justice focus is that we truly can change the world through music. Choral music is the perfect medium to raise awareness, engage ourselves and our community in dialogue, inspire compassion, and incite meaningful change. Music speaks directly to the heart, and choral music can share stories and experiences through lyrics.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, many of us are cut off from our usual outlets of community and expression. But we still need community, a purpose to channel our artistic talents, a way to use our energies for good. This project will have an immense impact on our lives and on the world as we come together in the Book Club, Q&amp;A Sessions and more, and as we combine our voices in song and let them resound across the world.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I am committed to writing this piece, hosting the Book Club and Q&amp;A sessions, and creating the virtual choir video. If my financial goal is not reached, all commitments listed in the “perks” will be honored. In this way, I and my business are absorbing the risk of this project. There is no risk to donors. The risk to myself is that if we do not reach our goal, I will have to write, edit, and engrave the piece and produce the rehearsal materials at a lower rate of compensation.</p>
<p>I am an experienced composer with an extensive catalog of choral music and many published works. I have successfully completed over a dozen professional commissions, and I have successfully administered and completed three commissioning consortiums.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Testimonials</h3>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">""Michael is an excellent musician with a clear, engaging musical voice. She has the ability to work quickly and flexibly with collaborating musicians and composes music that is both topical and accessible, while never vapid. Being a conductor herself she understands the learning process, the abilities of singers, and the need to write music that fits the voice. I highly recommending collaborating with this excellent musician and person.""</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">-Dr. Allan Friedman, Director, Women’s Voices Chorus of Chapel Hill</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">""My treble chorus commissioned Michael as part of the “Radium Girl” consortium. The experience was an incredibly rewarding one. I was in contact with Michael throughout the process, and they were able to use information about my singers and our abilities to inform their piece. They were very flexible and open to new ideas when I suggested using “singing bells” since my singers were struggling with overtone singing. The piece itself was lovely and powerful, yet accessible for my young (15-16 year old) singers. The poetic text and expressive text-setting led to fruitful discussions of social justice issues with my singers, and how art can shed light on these issues. The most rewarding component of the whole experience, however, was our two Skype sessions with Michael. Michael asked for a recording of my choir prior to the sessions so they could give us some feedback, and they really made my singers feel proud of our work on the piece. They were very open and answered questions from my singers about their creative process, their inspiration, and their life as a composer. They asked my singers questions that made them think deeply about the music and the subject matter. For my singers to have this kind of personal interaction with a composer throughout the commission process was incredibly valuable. The consortium made this commission affordable for my public school ensemble. We will certainly be participating in another project soon.""</p>

<p>Back in 2018 I had the amazing opportunity to record my first project, an EP album of worship songs that I had been leading at my church. Since then I've been blessed to be able to share those songs throughout southern New England. Along the way I've been slowly writing more songs. And then this year, like so many others, I found myself with a lot more time on my hands. </p>
<p>During the spring and early summer I spent time writing and soon realized that I was feeling called towards recording again. I reached out to Old Bear Studios to see about some options and was able to secure a week in the studio for January 2021.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1600600681/xv01efglgvzepirfkzdj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Old Bear Studio, Batavia, NY</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The plan for this album is to record several original songs along with a few contemporary arrangements of service music that we sing at my home church in Brookfield, CT. The goal is to record 10 tracks, making this my first full length album. It's an aggressive goal to accomplish with just 6 days in the studio, but work has already begun to make that happen. I'll be working ahead of the studio time to get things started and there will be many long days in the studio getting tracks recorded. </p>
<p>Along the way I'll be sharing bits and pieces of the process and the music itself. If you want even more insider access, be sure to check out the Backstage Pass and All Access level perks. Like and follow my Facebook page for more information about when I'm in the studio.</p>

<p>Recording a full length album involves a lot of planning and a lot of people. Along with that comes a lot of expenses. The goal this time around is higher, and I believe the perks for this campaign are aligned to match. I'm once again offering CD's, T-shirts, concert tickets, album artwork, and public recognition for your contribution within the album liner notes. There are also some cool new perks, like custom snapback hats, an album poster, behind the scenes access to the recording process, early access to the final tracks, and more. </p>
<p>You'll find all the perks listed on this page. When you see the perk you like, click on that perk to insure you're signed up for the right amount. The money donated goes towards studio time, which includes musicians for the sessions, post-production/mix-down, mastering, distribution, CD production, and the cost of the perks themselves.</p>

<p>This campaign is set up with flexible funding, meaning that all money donated towards the project will be used. Should the amount raised fall under the goal, the project will still move forward. From making another EP this time around, to recording all the tracks and releasing them at different times as funds are available for post-production and distribution; this project is 100% led by the Spirit and I firmly believe the funding needed will be available at the right time. </p>
<p>Of course we can't seem to do anything in 2020 without addressing the corona sized elephant in the room. I am planning a release concert to launch the music when it's ready. The goal is to hold that in late May/June 2021 at my home church. If in the event that guideline/restrictions delay either the studio or post-production timing, or the release itself, I will have the concert as soon as it is safe and feasible to do. This may include delaying several weeks or adjusting the concert location to a larger venue. </p>

</div><div>
<p>Of course this campaign is setup to generate funds for the project. But more importantly than that, I covet your prayers throughout the campaign and the entire process of making this album. It's a massive undertaking on so many fronts. I ask for prayer for guidance on making smart, timely decisions as needed. For good health and safety for all involved. For inspiration for myself, the producers and musicians as we finalize and record the songs. And for my family as they go on this journey with me. </p>
<p>Another huge way to help is to share this with others. That can be done directly by sending it to a friend or family member, or simply liking, commenting, and sharing on social media. The social media machine is massive and filters out so much, any interaction with campaign posts or updates helps others who might be interested see it as well.</p>
<p>Thanks again for taking a few minutes to check this out. God Bless! </p>

</div></div>","Back in 2018 I had the amazing opportunity to record my first project, an EP album of worship songs that I had been leading at my church. Since then I've been blessed to be able to share those songs throughout southern New England. Along the way I've been slowly writing more songs. And then this year, like so many others, I found myself with a lot more time on my hands. 
During the spring and early summer I spent time writing and soon realized that I was feeling called towards recording again. I reached out to Old Bear Studios to see about some options and was able to secure a week in the studio for January 2021.

Old Bear Studio, Batavia, NY
 
The plan for this album is to record several original songs along with a few contemporary arrangements of service music that we sing at my home church in Brookfield, CT. The goal is to record 10 tracks, making this my first full length album. It's an aggressive goal to accomplish with just 6 days in the studio, but work has already begun to make that happen. I'll be working ahead of the studio time to get things started and there will be many long days in the studio getting tracks recorded. 
Along the way I'll be sharing bits and pieces of the process and the music itself. If you want even more insider access, be sure to check out the Backstage Pass and All Access level perks. Like and follow my Facebook page for more information about when I'm in the studio.

Recording a full length album involves a lot of planning and a lot of people. Along with that comes a lot of expenses. The goal this time around is higher, and I believe the perks for this campaign are aligned to match. I'm once again offering CD's, T-shirts, concert tickets, album artwork, and public recognition for your contribution within the album liner notes. There are also some cool new perks, like custom snapback hats, an album poster, behind the scenes access to the recording process, early access to the final tracks, and more. 
You'll find all the perks listed on this page. When you see the perk you like, click on that perk to insure you're signed up for the right amount. The money donated goes towards studio time, which includes musicians for the sessions, post-production/mix-down, mastering, distribution, CD production, and the cost of the perks themselves.

This campaign is set up with flexible funding, meaning that all money donated towards the project will be used. Should the amount raised fall under the goal, the project will still move forward. From making another EP this time around, to recording all the tracks and releasing them at different times as funds are available for post-production and distribution; this project is 100% led by the Spirit and I firmly believe the funding needed will be available at the right time. 
Of course we can't seem to do anything in 2020 without addressing the corona sized elephant in the room. I am planning a release concert to launch the music when it's ready. The goal is to hold that in late May/June 2021 at my home church. If in the event that guideline/restrictions delay either the studio or post-production timing, or the release itself, I will have the concert as soon as it is safe and feasible to do. This may include delaying several weeks or adjusting the concert location to a larger venue.

Of course this campaign is setup to generate funds for the project. But more importantly than that, I covet your prayers throughout the campaign and the entire process of making this album. It's a massive undertaking on so many fronts. I ask for prayer for guidance on making smart, timely decisions as needed. For good health and safety for all involved. For inspiration for myself, the producers and musicians as we finalize and record the songs. And for my family as they go on this journey with me. 
Another huge way to help is to share this with others. That can be done directly by sending it to a friend or family member, or simply liking, commenting, and sharing on social media. The social media machine is massive and filters out so much, any interaction with campaign posts or updates helps others who might be interested see it as well.
Thanks again for taking a few minutes to check this out. God Bless!

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Hi! My name is Martin Motnik. I’m a professional bass guitarist who works as a freelance musician for live concerts and studio recordings. I’m also a member of the German pioneers of Heavy Metal <strong>ACCEPT</strong>, and a solo artist on bass guitars.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">When the pandemic hit and we couldn't go on the road, I decided to use the time to record a new full-length solo album. Following the tradition of my first album <i>Bass Invader</i> with renowned session drummer <strong>Gregg Bissonette</strong>, it was my goal to create complete and enjoyable instrumental songs while playing everything with bass guitars, on top of world-class drum tracks. To add variety, I’ve had the amazing Swedish guitar wizard <strong>Mattias IA Eklundh</strong> featured on two songs (one of them a <strong>Neil Peart-approved</strong> version of <strong>Rush’s YYZ</strong>). You can <strong>listen to the album</strong> on your preferred streaming service here: <strong><a href=""https://motnik.hearnow.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://motnik.hearnow.com</a> </strong></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/>On my new album I thought that every song should feature a guest solo, ideally each one played by a different guest. That artist should also be someone who was influential to my musical development or who meant a lot to me on a musical or personal level. Basically, I wanted to have an album where I’m playing with my heroes.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>""I always dreamed of playing with my heroes, and now the dream has become true.""</strong></h2>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>AND WHO T.F. IS MARTIN MOTNIK??</strong></h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I’m a passionate disciple of heavy strings, a slave to low frequencies, a person dedicated to being the foundation of a song and the glue within a band. My job is done well when I make others sound great. I’ve played over 5,000 shows; in 4,500 of them no one probably noticed me, and that’s a good thing. The bass should be felt; you should only notice it when it drops.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Born and raised in Ludwigshafen, Germany, I found my calling at age 13 when my brother brought home our first bass guitar. After that I spent my teenage years practicing and dreaming about becoming a professional bass player. After graduating high school I became a banker, quit that job, and went to college for an MBA diploma – the most fancy wall art I now own. But all those years I’ve dreamed about and worked on making music my profession. In 2008 I decided to go all in, bought a ticket to L.A. and took a chance with the savings from a music store job. I got lucky and ended up getting a tour with The Scorpions’ Uli Jon Roth, got a visa, got a Green Card, and was able to stay in the land of my dreams.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It hasn’t been easy, but it was worth it. The struggle of a musician jumping from gig to gig, always worrying if enough jobs would come through to pay the bills, is real. But the moments on stage, in the studio, and any other musical interaction are worth the efforts. I’ve recorded with legends like Hal Blaine and Don Randy, members of the Wrecking Crew who have played on more songs that some people have heard in their lives. I’ve performed and recorded with musicians who have provided the foundation for Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Carlos Santana, Ringo Starr, AC/DC, KISS, The Beach Boys, or The Eagles. I’ve played on 5 continents and traveled around the world and across the equator, all because of some big strings. Others want to pull them, I’m happy if I can pluck them.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I love hearing a song on which I helped make the artist in the front sound better, give them the foundation and the confidence to shine. This album is just my little step into the limelight. And still I hope I won’t bother you with mindless exercises or show-off techniques. They are fine, but they are tools to achieve something greater: actual music you can listen to and enjoy. If I can get you to do that, then I have done my job well. </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Some final remarks</strong></h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I tried to be as accurate in my perk descriptions as possible, however some fields had limitations set by Indiegogo. For clarification:</p>
<ul>
<li>If we reach 50% of the goal, every contribution of $100 and bigger will additionally receive the album as a vinyl record, autographed by me.</li>
<li>If we reach 75% of the goal, every contribution of $75 and bigger will additionally receive the album as a vinyl record, autographed by me.</li>
<li>If we reach 100% of the goal, every contribution of $50 and bigger will additionally receive the album as a vinyl record, autographed by me.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Also, I was limited to list a maximum of 10 perks per contribution. However, the higher-end perks will definitely include all of the before-mentioned perks, even if they're not listed in the drop-down fields. If you're interested in one of those perks, feel free to contact me for clarification and confirmation.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Lastly, I will eventually publish play-through videos for each song. If you become the owner of the NFT original file of the song (check the last two perks for explanation) I will add your name to the credits of the corresponding video; unless you prefer not to.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Can't contribute? No problem!</strong></h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">If you can’t help me directly through a contribution, no problem! These are tough times for many. Help me spread the words by sharing this campaign with your friends, colleagues, and everyone else who you think loves music! And who doesn’t love music?</p>

Here are some of the amazing people I had the honor to work with:

Some final remarks
I tried to be as accurate in my perk descriptions as possible, however some fields had limitations set by Indiegogo. For clarification:

If we reach 50% of the goal, every contribution of $100 and bigger will additionally receive the album as a vinyl record, autographed by me.
If we reach 75% of the goal, every contribution of $75 and bigger will additionally receive the album as a vinyl record, autographed by me.
If we reach 100% of the goal, every contribution of $50 and bigger will additionally receive the album as a vinyl record, autographed by me.

Also, I was limited to list a maximum of 10 perks per contribution. However, the higher-end perks will definitely include all of the before-mentioned perks, even if they're not listed in the drop-down fields. If you're interested in one of those perks, feel free to contact me for clarification and confirmation.
Lastly, I will eventually publish play-through videos for each song. If you become the owner of the NFT original file of the song (check the last two perks for explanation) I will add your name to the credits of the corresponding video; unless you prefer not to.
Can't contribute? No problem!
If you can’t help me directly through a contribution, no problem! These are tough times for many. Help me spread the words by sharing this campaign with your friends, colleagues, and everyone else who you think loves music! And who doesn’t love music?

<h3>Summary - Help us Make Music</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I am singer and co-writer for Toronto Experimental eco-Punk band RPNA (Real People Not Actors), and we would love to release a VINYL RECORD from our upcoming sessions at Chalet. As RPNA is on hiatus due to a member having other pro obligations, we are creating a reunion project and will record as The Rulers, a tribute to our original punk band from 1980. As of late-August, the proposed Rulers lineup for these sessions will be Mr. Mad (Ken),  and myself (Joe) from the original Rulers, plus three young players: guitarists Connor and Garrett from RPNA, plus new Ruler, Guitarist / Bassist, Scott.</p>
<p>We want to make a vinyl record, a Limited Edition Vinyl Record release!!! My start in music with Joe College and The Rulers produced a 7"" 45rpm single (incl a cover of Working Class Hero) that is still highly sought-after today, 40 years later. Now I want to produce and release a 12"" EP with members of Real People Not Actors plus guests whom I have played with over the years.</p>
<p>We will now record as The Rulers:</p>
<p>Wakin Up in the 2020s - original rocker</p>
<p>Home from Parade - Rulers version of the Ray Materick gem, a First Nations freedom song.</p>
<p>My Pledge of Love - Rockin cover of the Joe Jeffries R&amp;B gem</p>
<p>Dirty - Punky version of contemporary alt-rock song.</p>
<p>Hallucinogenics - Psychedelic version of the Matt Maeson ditty.</p>
<p>+ Gimme Shelter!!! - tribute version in planning</p>
<p>We have been rehearsing and recording for 3 years, though the past 18 months have been hampered by the pandemic. In addition to core members, we have had the pleasure of having Wild T sit in with us for some recording sessions. We have some time booked at an excellent professional studio (Chalet) in early October, and would LOVE to release our output as a vinyl EP.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here's us covering Hercules:</p>

<p> </p>
<p>You too can be passionate about this project, support us and get involved! It's hard for me to express the magnitude of what contributors like you will help us achieve. This may be my final recording session, so I want to make it something special. Can you contribute $15 to help us make a special recording?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>We are seeking to raise CDN$1,500, to use for releasing a vinyl record of our upcoming recording sessions. If we can exceed that, we will include a couple of special guests on the recordings, and be able to issue more copies. Even if we do not reach our goal, we will utilize the funds toward the recording and mixing and still try to produce, at minimum, a 7"" vinyl single. </p>
<p>1500 seems like a reasonable, humble amount and it will allow us to press a 7"" single. If we get to 2500 we can press a 12"" EP, and if we go higher, we can improve the quality of the recording and the pressing, and initiate a wider, record-store release, so THANK YOU ALL in advance!!!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Perks!!!</strong></p>
<p>We are offering a range of perks including digital downloads, outtakes, opportunities to attend a rehearsal or recording session, or a chance to sing or play on this record.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Your Impact</h3>
<p>People, please KNOW know the difference your contribution will make! The boys in The Rulers / RPNA will be super happy to be releasing a new vinyl record that will also be distributed digitally. We are an eco-conscious, antiwar Experimental Punk band hoping to raise consciousness via music, and YOU can be an ally and supporter!!!</p>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute at this time, but that doesn't mean YOU can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please get the word out and make some noise about this campaign, as that WILL be a meaningful contribution. Please share this page on your facebook, twitter and LinkedIn profiles, thank you!!!</li>
<li>Also, please feel free to click on and utilize the Indiegogo share tools!</li>

<h3>The Gist: </h3>
<p>Sings &amp; Plays is my second release as a leader and my first album as a singer. It is both exciting and a bit scary to debut this side of my artistic endeavors. </p>
<p>In collaboration with Mike Clement, Alex Dyring, Ryan Hanseler, Alexander Geddes and Gerald Watkins Jr. this album was recorded in New Orleans, LA at both Butcher Studios and the Music Shed. We are very proud of this release.  </p>
<p>The recording of ""Sings &amp; Plays"" began just before the onset of the COVID pandemic. As with many, many in our community and beyond, the past year and a half took a financial toll on me. So here I am appealing to you all. If you were hoping to purchase this album or support my career financially, please consider pre-ordering a copy here. This is the best way to directly support me as artists see very little to no revenue from iTunes and other streaming services. </p>
<p>Sings &amp; Plays is fully mixed, mastered, and ready to be released on August 13. My hope is to use this peer-to-peer campaign to recoup some of my costs. </p>
<h2>TLDR: </h2>
<p>Buy my album from me on this site. If you don't have $$ show some love by sharing this campaign on your facebook, insta, finsta, dating profile, etc.. </p>

<p>We are not talking about free money here. We have outlined everything you will get back from your donation (see the list of perks for the amount you donate), big or small. These perks will come in the form of food and beverages, VIP parties, private concerts, private meet and greets etc.  </p>
<p>Even if we do not reach our goal, all the money collected will help with bringing back one more much needed dining spot, live performance venue and safe space for many communities in Toronto.</p>

<p>We have put together some different options available to celebrate this project. Along side this we shall keep you updated with tour extras, photos and videos as the project unfolds.</p>
<p>After being together for only a year we have already amassed a big collection of songs and arrangements. We wanted to make a record that captures the energy of our live performances, so recorded it as much as we could simultaneously, adding extras but keeping the feel and dynamic of us performing live as best we could.</p>
<p>The album is coming out on CD and download with some lovely extras including badges, posters, a double bass lesson and some T-Shirts too!</p>
<p>Thanks so much for checking us out and being part of making of this record. We are very excited to be putting it out and we really hope people enjoy it :)</p>

<p>Hi guys, It's your boy K to the O</p>
<p>If you landed on this page, i just want to let you know you are an amazing person. I started doing music in the latter parts of 2019/beginning of 2020 and I so far, the journey has been a very epic one. I have received so much love from so many supporters and i will forever be grateful to everyone who has supported me.<br/><br/><strong>My first album - Highly Confidential</strong> was phenomenal. It brought so much joy to people all across the globe that I would have never thought would listen to my music. The album is being played on radio stations in countries like China, Panama, France, Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, United States, Iceland and many other countries and all of this has been possible through the support of God and everyone who has played my music<br/><br/>So, yeah, by the grace of God, my music journey has been very successful but what next? Do I just stop there? <strong>The answer is 'definitely not.'</strong> I am a strong believer in striving for excellence and I believe that with your help, we can get to greater heights. <br/><br/>Saying this, I am pleased to announce that my next body of work will be an EP of 6 songs called <strong>'Keep Your Head Above Water'</strong>. This EP will make you smile, dance and even cry (tears of joy I hope). It will help people mentally and spiritual through these trailing period and hopefully put a little bit of sunshine in the atmosphere.<br/><br/>Wow, you're still here. If you’re still reading, I am going to assume you have liked what you have read. And, if you’re still on the fence, check out my previous album 'Highly Confidential' which is out on all platforms: <a href=""https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/kofi8/highly-confidential"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/kofi8/highly-...</a> <br/><br/>God bless you,<br/>K.O.F.I</p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Making an international body of work is not a walk in the park as many may think. We have to think of many costs. This is a breakdown of the cost involved in the full production of 'Keep your Head Above Water' EP. I will try to keep it simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Purchasing Beats - £400.00</strong> (This will cover the cost for licensing each song so I can have full rights to it when it is played anywhere)</li>
<li>
<strong>Recording &amp; Mixing - £300.00</strong> (Cost for Recording, Engineering Cost &amp; Mastering for 6 songs)</li>
<li>
<strong>Marketing Cost - £500</strong> (Paid Ads, Promotion on different channels and platforms)</li>
<li>
<b>Music Video - £300</b> (This will cover the cost of 1 music video for the EP)</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot contribute to this project, that is totally fine. I am certain that if you could, you would not hesitate to help out. You can still do something to go a long way.</p>
<p>- Firstly, I would like you to <strong>personally share this campaign with 7 people</strong>. That means tell your family &amp;  your friends and hopefully, they can contribute. Remember, nothing is too little.</p>
<p>-  Secondly, I would like you to share this campaign on your social media platforms using the Indiegogo Sharing tool. It could also go a long way to achieve my goal. </p>

<h3>This Me</h3>
<p>My name is Lauren Leigh. I like to sing. I am a singer.</p>
<p>I come from a super musical family. Eve Selis is my auntie and Claudio Martin is my father, both musical legends in San Diego. </p>
<p> (I used to hate name-dropping but now I don't so whatever.) </p>
<p> I've always done other people's music but have been writing my own songs. And you know what? I'm over not having a little piece of creativity that I can call mine. I've been on the San Diego music scene professionally for five years and have grown to love the excitement of being a background vocalist, as well as a front-woman for several cover bands. I've worked hard, hustled and struggled to get by as a working musician. But this year my hard work has paid off and I got my first tour with The Pink Floyd Experience opening up for Foreigner in Canada.   </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1563396784/vjdxf7yaf9npnxf0zx7w.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>This tour reinforced the idea that I'm doing what I <i>should </i>be doing.  I've been close to giving up, but what artist hasn't? It takes courage to write your own stuff and bitch, I'm courageous.  So let's do this, yeah? </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need </h3>
<p>Okay, it takes a lot of mulah to make a record, but luckily we are only making an EP. HA!</p>
<p>I am estimating that it will take a minimum of $6,000 to make a bare bones EP for release.  However, I am setting a goal of $10,000.  Let me break down how that money will be spent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paying for production and mixing.  Duh. I am working with Fernando Perdomo at Reseda Ranch Studios! A dream come true!  </li>
<li>Guest Musicians-- Pay the talent. I can't do it on my own and honestly gross, who does that? My band will consist of local legends Sam Hunt, Joshua Taylor, Joshua Weinstein, Tony Econom, Harley Magsino, Carissa Schroeder, Sandi King and probably a few more because I have VISIONS. </li>
<li>Mastering.  I want to work with the one and only Fernando Perdomo (Echo in the Canyon) and his ears on this.  I trust him more than anyone to get it right. </li>
<li>Distribution.  iTunes, Spotify, Pandora, and all the digital things, as well as good, old-fashioned hard copy CD's for me to sell at shows. I want to use Groove House and their Eco-sleeves to provide an eco-friendly case with album art. </li>
<li>Promotions.  I need to create a promo kit and get it into professional promoters hands for the best chance at getting heard by the right people. I want to use Borerro Visuals for the kit, promoters TBD. </li>
<li>Extra money (anything over $6000) goes toward making everything BETTER. Album art, music video, any extra stuff I couldn't do to make the EP better because it's expensive (extra tracks, musicians, guest vocalists). Anything over that will allow me to not have to grind and hustle so hard every week to make ends meet, and I'll be able to take an extra day in the studio and work on this. </li>
</ul>

<h3>What You Get</h3>

</ul>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I mean, music is my life.  I want to have something to show my son when he's older. Your ears will like it. It could be a game changer for my career. BOOM. Impact.  </p>

I am most passionate about engaging with the parts of us that are fragile and vulnerable and if art has nothing to do with investigating these areas, then what is it truly for?

They brought so much creative energy to these songs - adding new sections, intensifying harmonies and yes, finding the perfect grooves.

I had the honor of recording the strings on my last album<i> Fear Not</i> with Drew and was blown away by his skill as well as the facilities at Hope. These sessions were also unique in that a group of Drew's students in the recording arts program were in attendance for hands on training.

I believe I have something important to say and the message has always been my focus. Fear Not (2017) and Alone On The World Stage (2015) garnered praise in publications such as the Huffington Post, American Songwriter, Paste, Folk Radio UK and have made numerous 'Best of the Year' lists. Both of these records were crowdsourced and the money raised enabled them to be heard without the support of a major label. I see <i>Walking Into The Black</i> completing a trilogy of strong albums that have already produced fruit.</p><p> </p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><p>In the past, I've used Kickstarter, a platform that uses an 'all or nothing' approach' (i.e. If you raise your goal then you receive the money. If not, then you don't get a cent). In those cases, I hadn't started production. This record is different because as soon as I finished writing the final song, I felt an urgency to capture the feeling and share it. I wanted to hold on to my experience at the Monastery and let go of the pain of those eight months. I wanted to express my current thoughts on the world around me. So, I jumped right into recording and its expense.</p><p>It is a risk to create independent art. There is no insurance when things go haywire. I am hopeful I can raise the funds to finish this piece of art. As it is nearing the finish line, I don't fear its completion artistically, but financial support is crucial to get these songs to you.</p><p> </p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Please help us get the word out and make some noise about this campaign. We have 35 days to make it happen and even though I have a loud voice, my reach is only so far! </p><p>Please share, post and spread the word! It will also help to build the excitement for release day.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1572824639/psehjamdwrdpovaiulnk.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Photo by Derek Ketchum</p></div>","Walking Into The Black Thank you so much for checking out my Indiegogo page.

We recorded the rhythm tracks over a weekend in October with Ian Gorman at La Luna Studio in Kalamazoo. The band absolutely nailed it in these sessions and truly gave us the definitive performances of these songs.   Then, on to overdubs with the wonderful Drew Elliot at Hope College. I had the honor of recording the strings on my last album Fear Not with Drew and was blown away by his skill as well as the facilities at Hope. These sessions were also unique in that a group of Drew's students in the recording arts program were in attendance for hands on training. In this sessions, we recorded the incredible Debra Perry & Majestic Praise (previously featured on Queen Bee), Jen Fortosis (previously featured on After Sally), Patty Pierzchala, additional guitar, Rhodes/Hammond B3, and my vocals. All in all, the tracking is now complete! We have mixing and mastering left to go. Photo by Josh Kaufman The PartyYou are probably reading this because my music has communicated to you in the past and that is incredibly powerful and meaningful to me! My aim is to create an album that will touch you personally. What this means is a product that is recorded and packaged beautifully and professionally. It also means working with a wonderful team of artists; many of whom freelance full-time. It takes a community to sustain the arts and I am grateful to be both a receiver and a benefactor.   PRODUCTION COSTS (Estimated):$3,350 - Room rentals, engineering, mixing & mastering$1,000 - Short-run vinyl pressing. Vinyl is back! How cool would it be to hear this music on a record player?$1,500- Album Packaging/Printing$300 - Rewards Shipping$300 - Marketing/Digital Release Setup$1,850 - Artists$400 - Indiegogo platform Fees___________________TOTAL: $8,700 The Impact “Blake’s breathtaking eye for significant detail and his skill for getting inside of characters to reveal flesh and blood human lives is nearly unparalleled among modern songwriters, no matter if they are mainstream or indie.”    -No Depression I have been an independent musician for ten years now and have slowly built a following; particularly in the US, Netherlands and Italy. I have done this from the quality of my songwriting and performance, rather than a popular social media platform. I believe I have something important to say and the message has always been my focus. Fear Not (2017) and Alone On The World Stage (2015) garnered praise in publications such as the Huffington Post, American Songwriter, Paste, Folk Radio UK and have made numerous 'Best of the Year' lists. Both of these records were crowdsourced and the money raised enabled them to be heard without the support of a major label. I see Walking Into The Black completing a trilogy of strong albums that have already produced fruit. Risks & ChallengesIn the past, I've used Kickstarter, a platform that uses an 'all or nothing' approach' (i.e. If you raise your goal then you receive the money. If not, then you don't get a cent). In those cases, I hadn't started production. This record is different because as soon as I finished writing the final song, I felt an urgency to capture the feeling and share it. I wanted to hold on to my experience at the Monastery and let go of the pain of those eight months. I wanted to express my current thoughts on the world around me. So, I jumped right into recording and its expense.It is a risk to create independent art. There is no insurance when things go haywire. I am hopeful I can raise the funds to finish this piece of art. As it is nearing the finish line, I don't fear its completion artistically, but financial support is crucial to get these songs to you. Other Ways You Can HelpPlease help us get the word out and make some noise about this campaign. We have 35 days to make it happen and even though I have a loud voice, my reach is only so far! Please share, post and spread the word! It will also help to build the excitement for release day. Photo by Derek Ketchum",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Story:</h3>
<p>Hi! We're Joe and Beau. We play music as Gold Light and Snakemusk respectively. We teamed up last year over a love of Hank Williams and The Everly Brothers et al., and started a little duo project that evolved into an all out 5 piece band. We wrote a bunch of original songs and recorded them over the course of last year. We now have together a full-length album of these songs that we would love to release as a vinyl record.. BUT WE NEED YOUR HELP TO DO SO!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Releasing a record is fairly expensive, and we are not all that rich. We are aiming to raise funds to help with the cost of pressing vinyl. It's always been a dream to release an album on vinyl and we feel we have the perfect one to do so with, and by contributing even the smallest amount you will help us achieve this dream!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>It's pretty simple. We're only looking for help with the actual vinyl pressing. For 300 units from United Pressing, it is $2,001 + Shipping. That's where the money is going. If we don't reach our entire goal, we will pay the rest out of our own pockets. But like we said, we are not all that rich.</p>
<p>So think of this as basically a pre-order. We're also keeping what you get really simple: You get the record. Or you get a cassette, or you get a CD, or you get a digital download. (We're paying for the CDs and Cassettes out of our pockets.)</p>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Every little bit helps! Seriously, it all adds up! I did one other Kickstarter project years back that was successful for an indie film, and the whole reason things like this are able to get funded, is to get A LOT of people to contribute just SMALL AMOUNTS. If you're reading this and you were able to give just $5 bucks, we would be well on our way! </p>
<p>Also, simply spreading the word helps IMMENSELY. Indiegogo even has really simple to use share tools, so help us get the word out and help our dreams come true!</p>

<p><strong>Short Summary​</strong></p>
<p>New Boom CD &amp; Tour</p>
<p>Drummer, guitarist, composer, band leader &amp; teacher from New York. Son &amp; nephew of professional drummers in NYC &amp; Westchester County. I have been playing professionally since the age of 14. Sideman on many recordings of Jazz, Funk, Rock, Pop, Latin &amp; World Music. In addition to concerts,recordings, touring &amp; teaching, I have composed music for &amp; played in musical theatre in New York &amp; Vienna. 2 previous cds received critical acclaim in the USA,UK,Canada, Austria, Germany &amp; Belgium.</p>
<p>This will be my 3rd CD and 10th tour. I financed everything myself in the past but I'm coming off of several years of deaths, divorce and economic destruction so I need help. Frankly, I was wary about asking for money but after everything that's happenend I NEED to do this more than ever!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need to raise €5,000 to record, master, produce  &amp; package the cds. This includes artwork &amp; pics in &amp; on the cd as well as setting up downloadable tracks. After that it's travel costs and believe me, it all adds up very quickly. I know people who've spent more than this on recording alone.</p>
<p>The first thing you get is the satisfaction of helping an independent artist. Think of salmon swimming up stream or David &amp; Goliath!</p>
<p>Ofcourse you get the new cd or any combination of previous cds plus the new one. There's an instructional dvd for drummers and band performance for your event or venue. There will be co-producer credits for the generous contributors.</p>
<p>I will do my best to reach the goal in 60 days but if I don't I will just keep going privtely until I reach it. That means that everything will happen later than planned but IT WILL HAPPEN. I never give up.</p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Music is the one true language and even religion because it reaches EVERYONE! It breaks down all barriers; age,socio-economic, political, religious and cultural. EVERYTHING! I really feel blessed to be a musician because no matter where I play or what kind of music, people experience Joy. That is a blessing. It's also a responsibility. So not only will you experience your own joy, you'll be helping to spread joy. And we need that.</p>
<p>As I said before I've done this alone in the past so with your help I KNOW I can do it again.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>In another life in New York I had an investment broker's license and I invested people's money. I believe that makes me uniquely qualified to raise and handle these funds.

<p>Kate Lucid is my musical identity, which was born almost as soon as my regular identity. Family archives attest the first singing on camera at the age of exactly 2 years and 3 months. And it was nothing less than a love song. (Watch out for a video of this coming soon on my social pages!)</p>
<p>I started writing songs when I was 9 (however, you'd laugh if you heard my first creations imitating Britney Spears). Since then I've developed a unique style, which some describe as lyrical, deep, sophisticated, soulful. I accompany myself on the piano, which I've been playing since the age of 6 (I have classical music background). </p>
<p>Looking back at all the years of performances, music contests and songwriting, sometimes I feel abashed that I still haven't recorded a professional album. All I can say is that it has been long time coming. I feel that I owe it to my music and, more importantly, to all the people who have expressed their admiration over the years to make a high-quality record that all of us would be able to enjoy. </p>
<p>All the songs are ready to be recorded (although I still have to make some choices, since I have many more than I could possible include in one album). The recording will take place here in Cambridge, UK, where I currently reside. All I need is to raise enough funds to make this happen. And this is were you can become part of this fascinating story!</p>

<p>I have been truly blessed to work with some remarkabe musicians throughout my musical lifetime. Here's what they have to say about me. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>""Kate is a first-rate musician - Excellent pitch and a rich and luscious quality to her voice that makes you want to hear more and more!

<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>""Kate and I shared the same venue, for some musical event in Brussels, a few years ago. My first impression of her was that she was quite attentive to details, checking carefully the piano of the jazz bar, when my own request was ways simpler: if that machine could produce any sound, it was fine for me. (laugh)</i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>Later, Kate’s performance caught my attention: her songs were sophisticated, delicate and full of emotions. There was something happening, as if every note was was carrying its own load of beauty. It was complex, almost like classical music in a pop world.</i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>My biggest surprise was when, after finishing my own set of songs, peacefully sipping a beer, Kate came to me, commenting on one of my songs, giving a kind appreciation of it, spontaneously. It was a nice and generous attitude from her, and the beginning of a mutual interest in our respective music.</i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>I discovered more of her work, as stunning as I could expect, and asked her to be part of my song “Eleganto Ni”, on which she played a smooth, rich and inspired part of synthesised piano. The recording session was all matching Kate’s image: professional, attentive, inspired and kind.</i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>Knowing that Kate would finally record her own solo album is a wonderful news, not only for me and her fans, but also for those who didn’t have yet the chance to listen to her delightful music"".</i></p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>""I know Kate Lucid as Kate Sukmanyuk as we were classmates at the lyceum. Since 2005 till 2009 we sang together at the chorus. And already at that time I found how great a musician she is, as she is not only a singer, but also an excellent pianist and songwriter. When I heard her first song “A dream”(Mriya) I realized that she is a gifted one! While studying me and Kate were a part of the quartet and worked closely at the Lyceum ensemble. I guess it was quite a good contribution to her musical future. As a multifunctional musician Kate has a great future!

Family archives attest the first singing on camera at the age of exactly 2 years and 3 months. And it was nothing less than a love song. (Watch out for a video of this coming soon on my social pages!)
I started writing songs when I was 9 (however, you'd laugh if you heard my first creations imitating Britney Spears). Since then I've developed a unique style, which some describe as lyrical, deep, sophisticated, soulful. I accompany myself on the piano, which I've been playing since the age of 6 (I have classical music background). 
Looking back at all the years of performances, music contests and songwriting, sometimes I feel abashed that I still haven't recorded a professional album. All I can say is that it has been long time coming. I feel that I owe it to my music and, more importantly, to all the people who have expressed their admiration over the years to make a high-quality record that all of us would be able to enjoy. 
All the songs are ready to be recorded (although I still have to make some choices, since I have many more than I could possible include in one album). The recording will take place here in Cambridge, UK, where I currently reside. All I need is to raise enough funds to make this happen. And this is were you can become part of this fascinating story!

If you haven't heard any of my songs yet (or would just like to enjoy them once more ;), here are a few videos for you to start with. For more please visit the social media links below.

I have been truly blessed to work with some remarkabe musicians throughout my musical lifetime. Here's what they have to say about me. 
""Kate is a first-rate musician - Excellent pitch and a rich and luscious quality to her voice that makes you want to hear more and more! One hears the bottom end of the voice and thinks - wow! and then she surprises you by carrying the same stunning quality all the way up! What a talent!""  
Eric Delson, Conductor and composer, Musical Director of the Brussels Choral Society, Head of Performing Arts Department at the International School of Brussels
 
www.brusselschoralsociety.com
""Kate and I shared the same venue, for some musical event in Brussels, a few years ago. My first impression of her was that she was quite attentive to details, checking carefully the piano of the jazz bar, when my own request was ways simpler: if that machine could produce any sound, it was fine for me. (laugh)
Later, Kate’s performance caught my attention: her songs were sophisticated, delicate and full of emotions. There was something happening, as if every note was was carrying its own load of beauty. It was complex, almost like classical music in a pop world.
My biggest surprise was when, after finishing my own set of songs, peacefully sipping a beer, Kate came to me, commenting on one of my songs, giving a kind appreciation of it, spontaneously. It was a nice and generous attitude from her, and the beginning of a mutual interest in our respective music.
I discovered more of her work, as stunning as I could expect, and asked her to be part of my song “Eleganto Ni”, on which she played a smooth, rich and inspired part of synthesised piano. The recording session was all matching Kate’s image: professional, attentive, inspired and kind.
Knowing that Kate would finally record her own solo album is a wonderful news, not only for me and her fans, but also for those who didn’t have yet the chance to listen to her delightful music"".
Gilles Snowcat sings love songs after dark since 1988, and is more recently involved in massage and hypnosis music, after finishing writing an ebook, ""The Rock Star Paradox"". He never left the rock scene though, and is currently recording a new album, that he already humbly depicts as 'an event that will make the baby-boom look like a joke'.

""Kate and I met up for a jam session in Brussels couple of years ago. Her voice carries a conviction that reflects any lyric she delivers. Her writing abilities is in a league of it's own and I deeply feel the music industry needs more of a talent like Kate's, as she can definitely contribute to the world at large"". 
Tomi Temidara, singer-songwriter, Live show finalist on The Voice, Flanders, Belgium

www.facebook.com/TomiTVVV/
""I know Kate Lucid as Kate Sukmanyuk as we were classmates at the lyceum. Since 2005 till 2009 we sang together at the chorus. And already at that time I found how great a musician she is, as she is not only a singer, but also an excellent pianist and songwriter. When I heard her first song “A dream”(Mriya) I realized that she is a gifted one! While studying me and Kate were a part of the quartet and worked closely at the Lyceum ensemble. I guess it was quite a good contribution to her musical future. As a multifunctional musician Kate has a great future! I believe that her first album will definitely burst the music industry!""

<p>I’m Kris Schultz, a Singer-Songwriter from Austin, TX.</p>
<p>I took the long way to songwriting, and arrived later than most. For much of my adult life, I worked for other musicians and bands on the road, helping them out in any way that was needed. I slung merch, I drove vans, I lugged heavy gear, I even did some road managing. But it never crossed my mind to try playing music, myself. </p>
<p>Until May 2017, that is, when  I found myself with some extra time, and on a whim, I bought a cheap guitar. Around the same time, my longtime friend Kacy Crowley (who I’d assisted on the road) had started her business as a songwriting mentor and artist development consultant.  On yet another whim (and surprising myself as I said it) I mentioned that maybe I would be a client. She seemed just as surprised as I was, and asked me if I could sing.  I said, “I have no idea. I might be tone deaf, for all I know.” She came over. I dusted off the three chords I had learned from a drummer friend sixteen years before (but had never practiced).  I played Stevie Nicks’ “After the Glitter Fades” with the two of those chords that didn’t scare me. And I think we were both pleasantly surprised I wasn’t tone deaf.</p>
<br/><p>Kacy knew I’d written stories and poems all my life, and gave me an assignment to try to write a song.  I surprised myself yet again when I committed to it, and wrote my very first song all by myself - music, melody and lyrics.  Once I discovered I could write songs, and sing, this whole new sense of hope and optimism overtook me. I went from being a person who woke up at the very last minute each morning, to a person who woke up two hours early to practice and write.  Each night, I couldn’t wait to wake up the next day with the possibility of a new song or some other new musical discovery waiting for me. That feeling continues today.</p> <p>I’ve spent the last couple years playing as many shows as I possibly can. I’ve stuck to the routine of waking up early and writing and practicing every single day. I’m not exaggerating at all when I say discovering songwriting has changed my life.  It’s given me a new life where I feel like I am finally completely the person I am meant to be.</p> <p>The last few months, I’ve had the opportunity to play a few times with a full band (Brian Mendes on drums, Palli on bass, Charlie Richards on guitar, baritone guitar, and lap steel, and the aforementioned Kacy Crowley on background vocals!)  I’ve known everyone in the band for years, and have always admired their work.  I still geek out over the fact that they are playing the songs I wrote on my couch.  And right from the start, everything they played just sounded like I imagined it in my mind.  We went into Ron D’Argenio’s studio recently and recorded two songs, and I’m so proud of what we did, and so ridiculously happy with the results, I decided there was no way around it…. we needed to record eight more songs, for a full length album.  And Ron was so welcoming, with such a kind presence, and is such a talented engineer, I’m confident his studio is the perfect place to record the whole thing.</p>
<p>There have been so many people who have been such an amazing part of this whole journey with me, right from the very first show I played in November of 2017. From people coming out to the shows, sending me encouragement, just generally being amazing to me when I decided to take this crazy leap of faith and throw myself into writing and playing music.  I appreciate that so much, and I hope you will all consider being a part of this segment of the journey, too.  Obviously, contributing monetarily is a big help, but so is sharing this link with friends, talking about this campaign, inviting your friends to check out the music or join you at a show.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>My name is Gwendolyn Collins.  I am a soul singer/songwriter and storyteller out of MD (USA). I am producing my third project, Storytelling Side III and I would love if you would partner with me to make this vision come true.  I'm very excited to share these storytelling moments with you.  Your contributions are key to helping me make this happen.  As many of you know creating an album is very expensive yet the feeling of completion leaves me feeling amazingly amazing.  By investing in myself, I've previously self-funded two albums, self-produced and funded both national and international shows highlighting myself and other talented indie artists, written and produced for other indie artists all through my movement #TheVirgoLounge but I want to take this album to the next level.  </p>
<p>With your partnership/pledge, I'll be able to do that by hiring session musicians so you can feel the live experience, utilizing recording studios outside of my home, work with top producers and engineers, as well as bringing in some top notch artists as features. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>This campaign is the sole vehicle to complete my third storytelling series.  This album is a window into my soul where I get to describe everything I've learned about love, loss and the beauty of music.  In order to professionally record and produce this album, I need the financial support of my music community and that's where you come in:)</p>
<h3>What's in it for YOU!</h3>
<p>Your contributions to this campaign will be rewarded!! </p>
<p>I have some really cool partner perks you can choose from depending on the amount you decide to give.  These partner perks are offered to you in exchange for your support.  The rewards vary from downloads of the newest album, signed cds, t-shirts, and really cool goodie bags packed with so many musical delights. </p>If I don't reach my goal of $14,000 the money that IS raised below the goal will still be used toward the album while the remainder will come from me.  This could slow down the process however the rewards that are promised will still be distributed once the album is complete.</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As an independent artist, I receive no funds from a big label.  I have no big marketing machine behind me, yet I have done all I can to continually put out quality music as well as support other independent artists thru having them on LIVE shows around the world, showcasing their music on my radio show and sharing their music to my amazing listening audience.  I understand how it takes a collaborative and sharing mindset to make this music work and to spread the music worldwide.  </p>
<p>Often it takes the help of my listeners (new and old) to continue to create music for the soul and those things motivate me to keep making that type of music.</p>
<p>I only have 60 days to reach my $18,000 goal!!  and I believe it can be done.  During this entire process I will share with you how I am allocating the funds giving you sneak peaks into the recording process, studio time, makings of merchandise, photo-shoots and rehearsals.</p>
<p>Every single penny will go towards the completion and marketing of this album.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help.  Help me get the word out and make some noise about this campaign by SHARING, SHARING and SHARING:) This is the most important thing you can do if you can or can't contribute.  </p>

<h3>Why we are going to Bristol, TN</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3> </h3>
<p>The Lucky 5 is a hot swing jazz band inspired by the jazz manouche sound of Django Reinhardt. We've been playing music together for 10 years.We have the opportunity to record a reel to reel album with Bigtone Records in Bristol, TN, and to do some gigs along the way. We have not recorded an album for a while, and in the past 2 years we have some exciting new additions to our band, and have been working on fresh traditional and  original compositions. Bigtone is known for their live true analog reel to reel recording process. Our music is particularly perfect for this type of recording. </p>
<p>Making the trip will be Kip Beacco (guitar), Matt Downing (upright bass), Jonathan Talbott (fiddle), Carolyn Dufraine (trombone), Will Carroll (drums) and Emily Herder (clarinet). </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Cost of the trip/recording, and your perks</h3>
<p>The cost for the week long trip to Bigtone Records in Bristol, TN, will be $10,000, and includes the following:</p> <p>Road transportation for the band  of six (rental van, gas, driver)</p>
<p>Expenses (meals on the road) for the band</p>
<p>Housing/hotels when needed on the road </p>
<p>Studio time and editing for final product from Bigtone Records</p>
<p>Production of vinyl album, CD, and downloadable digital files</p> <p>Premiums: </p> <p>This is such a great opportunity for us - we are over the moon with the possibility of sharing our latest music with our friends. Your support comes with our thanks and the following percs:</p> <p>$5 - Lucky 5 sticker</p>
<p>$15 - Digital Download of LP</p>
<p>$20 -  signed CD</p>
<p>$25 - Lucky 5 T-shirt</p>
<p>$40 - signed Vinyl </p>
<p>$50  - signed Vinyl and CD</p>
<p>$100 - t shirt, album, CD</p>
<p>$500 - favorite  song recorded (10 available)</p>
<p>$1000 - Venue Appearance</p>
<p>$1500 - Private house concert</p>
<p>$3000 - Producer credit on album</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Your contribution will make it possible for us to take our band to the next level. Recording is expensive, and while we play as much music as we can, we all have day jobs. We love live music, and think that is the best way to experience what we do, but the true analog recording we will do at Bigtone Records is the next best thing. Bands need to record. For spotify, for festival applications, for new venues, and for our friends. We are so excited about our work in the past year we want to be  able to preserve  and share it with  you.</p>
<p>This is totally doable, and we are doing it.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are doing this, the studio is booked,  and we will get to Tennessee one way or the other. Your support will make this venture manageable for us (this is  not a luxurious budget).  It will allow us to press the recording to vinyl and CD, cover the costs of printing.</p>

<p>Family/friends/fans/strangers -</p>
<p><strong>HELLO + THANK YOU </strong>for being here and supporting my music. It means THE WORLD! I wish I could personally hug you all... but #COVID-19 (ugh)..</p>
<p>My name is Emily Bea and I’m a singer-songwriter from Salt Lake City, Utah! I have been writing, recording and releasing music independently for the past 10 years. It has been so fun to share my songs with you and to build a following/fan base over the past several years. And I just want to <strong><u>THANK YOU</u></strong> from bottom of my heart for your continued love and support in my music. It truly means so much and I honestly could not do what I do without you.</p>
<p>It has been a minute since I have released an album… And mostly that is due to growing up, getting married and having just a few (a lot... hehe) of grown up expenses to pay for. <strong>BUT</strong> I am so excited to announce the release of a brand new album titled, ""Coming Back Home"" to be released fall/winter 2020. </p>
<p><strong><u>ABOUT THE ALBUM:</u></strong></p>
<p>As a songwriter, a lot of my inspiration comes from my relationships and the people I hold close to my heart. That sparked from a young age and more specifically when I was 16 years old visiting with my darling great-grandmother, Lila. While visiting with her with asked her to share the story of how she met my great grandpa (which we recorded on video! See my insta for the video) and after hearing that cutest love story a desire was ignited to write a special song in honor of them... which is now known as “Forever With You” – a song I released in 2018 which will also be included on this album... AND a special piano version as well!</p>
<p>This new album is so special to me, probably my favorite yet, because it is a <strong>HOME</strong> themed album where every single song is about my home and the people I’ve shared it with. It is filled with songs about love, childhood, growing up, family, loss… all things I feel we experience in life. And I hope that as you listen to this album you will feel a bit of nostalgia and a piece of your personal home too.</p>
</div><div>
<p><u><strong>COSTS:</strong></u></p>
<p>One thing a lot of people don’t realize is that independent artists don’t have the financial backing of major labels. So all of the expenses that come with releasing music come out of our own pocket.</p>
<p>I am doing this campaign in hopes to receive some help with the expenses of making/releasing this album and in return I have created some fun perks for you to receive as you donate/contribute to this campaign!</p>
<p><u><strong>GAME PLAN:</strong></u></p>
<p>In order to fund this album I have a budget of $12,000+. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recording costs - roughly $1,000/song</li>
<li>Distribution/physical CD costs</li>
<li>Marketing/promotion costs</li>
<li>Album photography and videography</li>
<li>Merchandise</li>
<li>INDIEGOGO + Payment/Processing Fees</li>
<li>SO MUCH MORE!</li>
</ul>
<p>If we do exceed the $12,000 (or if I don't end up using the funds raised!) I will, of course, save for future music releases or use additional funds towards more perks for YOU!</p>
</div><div><p><u><strong>HOW CAN YOU HELP?</strong></u></p></div><div>
