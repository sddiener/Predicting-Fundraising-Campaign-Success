<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are Farewell, Dreamer. We're a band from Boston, Massachusetts, and for the past three and a half years, we have given everything to this band to make things happen, and it's finally paying off. After funding three independent releases, three independent tours and spending countless days playing, writing, practicing, and booking shows, we're ready to put out our third release, <em>Adapt &amp; Overcome</em>. This record encompasses all of our hard work and struggles both metaphorically and literally, and we're ready to take the next step. It is imperative that our fans and our potential fans hear this album in any way they can, the most important of which would be our getting on the road and playing it in front of them so they can see the raw emotion and intensity we put into writing every song. The bottom line: we need to tour so people can know about us. After exhausting all of our resources, and paying every cent for recordings, merchandise, a van, a trailer, and all our gear out of pocket, we have nobody to turn to except our fans to help us take this next step. The purpose of this campaign is to reach out to our fans and ask them to help us in any way they can, because our van and trailer are on their last legs, and we need to replace them, as well as replenish our merchandise supply, print cd's, and pay countless other miscellaneous expenses that come with being in a band day-to-day.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here is what we need, completely broken down.</p>
<p>With $6000, we will be able to pay for:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new van, or repairs to keep our current van on the road</li>
<li>A new trailer so we can fit all our equipment, luggage, and merchandise</li>
<li>A new stock of merchandise to sell at shows to make sure we have gas</li>
<li>Pressing more copies of our new album and paying for online distribution</li>
</ul>
<p>With your donations , depending on the amount, you can receive perks such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>A digital download of our new album</li>
<li>A signed copy of our new album</li>
<li>Signed thank you letters/Personal phone calls</li>
<li>Merch bundles that include CD's, bracelets, and T-shirts</li>
<li>Handwritten lyrics</li>
<li>A signed guitar</li>
<li>An all-expenses paid plane trip to come hang out with us</li>
<li>A band member will get your name tattooed on him</li>
<li>A personal concert</li>
<li>Inclusion in the thank you section of our next album</li>
</ul>
If we dont reach our full goal, anything close will be one step closer to making sure we're safe, and our van and trailer will hold up to the harsh demands of the road.</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our fans are everything to us. We need them so much, and we never take them for granted. We have fans that ask us to come to different parts of the country- even different parts of the world to come play for them so they ca hear our music live and meet us; and as much as we would love to do so, it just isnt feasible with what little we have right now. As a contributor, your donation, be it $5 or $6000, will be one more thing that will keep this band alive and ready to see the world and meet all of our fans. We aren't signed, we dont have funding, we're 5 kids that want to make music and see the world; and that goal is easily within reach with the help of our fans and generous donors.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cant help out with a monetary donation, you can help us by shooting us an email just to say hey, by sharing the link to our fundraiser so others can see it, and hopefully help out, or just by sharing our music and videos with everyone you know. Every little bit counts.</p>

<h3>Hey Folks!</h3>
<p>I'm a muscian named Bubbles Brown. Currently living in Chicago but a Flordia native.</p>
<p>I traveled up here 5 years ago to persue my dream of playing music, and what better place than Chicago, right? Its been a great 5 years. I've met so many interesting people and musicians who have greatly impacted my craft. </p>
<p>Unfortunately with recording limitations I have yet to be able to market my talent. I make a point to perform at least once a week in bars across Chicago. But without a product to hand out, I can't stay in peoples minds the way some other recorded musicians might.</p>
<p>I've recorded here and there, but never in a professional studio. That is why I come to you. With your contribution I can finally sit down and record a full length album that I believe will definitely benefit my career as a muscian. Not only would I be recording an album, I would be adding to my portfolio. Something concrete to share with people.</p>

<h2>Who is Michi?</h2>
<p>Michi is an upcoming singer from Japan, who loves singing, acting, and performing on stage since she was little.  She has been in a number of musicals, and has even won a performance contest with a live dance group.  Michi has a real passion for bringing fun and joy to her audiences.  People naturally warm to her bubbly personality and infectious smile.  She's just fun to be around!</p>
<h2>The project:</h2>
<p>While she was taking vocal training in New York and in Vancouver, Michi started this project with other musicians who had the same passion and dreams as she had.  Together, they wrote and recorded 7 J-pop songs, ranging from uptempo, dance grooves to melodic ballads.  With these songs, they want to make and distribute a CD. </p>
<h2>The passion:</h2>
<p>Michi has a strong passion for bringing enjoyment and positivity to others through her music and performances.  In the culture of Japan, there are many pressures on the people, and the younger generation are no exception. There is a need for people to hear uplifting words and music, to encourage them through everyday life.</p>
<p>You may also have seen Japan in the news the past while, with events such as the tsunami and the nuclear disasters.  This has added to the pressures that many people feel, and Michi wants to do her part to encourage the people of Japan, and also around the world.  Michi is excited to share her music with you!</p>
<h2>The project so far:</h2>
<p>Much of the work for Michi's cd has already been done. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>recording all the tracks for each song</li>
<li>all the photography is completed</li>
<li>the graphics/layout for the cd packaging</li>
<li>rough pre-mixes and arrangments of the songs</li>
</ul>
<h2>Still to do:</h2>

<li>mastering [the final preparation for manufacturing</li>
<li>manufacturing the physical CD's</li>
<li>distributing and marketing - getting the music out there!</li>
</ul>
<h2> Your support:</h2>
<p>       This is the part where you can get involved!  There are 2 ways you can be a real part to help make this cd the best it can be.</p>
<h3>   1]  You can help financially.</h3>
<p>Michi needs to raise $7,500 to complete the cd.  Here is a breakdown of how the money will be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>mixing = $5,500</li>
<li>mastering = $1,000</li>
<li>manufacturing = $1,000</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the amount needed for the production of the cd.  If more than $7,500 is raised, which would be fantastic, it will be used to market/promote the cd!   </p>
<p>Michi is offering some special THANK YOU gifts for your participation in this project.</p>
<p>For $10 - you will receive a digital download of the cd</p>
<p>For $20 - get a physical cd and the digital download</p>

<p> </p>
<h2>Michiってどんな人？</h2>
<p>日本で活動する歌手。幼少の頃から歌や演技が大好きだった彼女はミュージカルにも出演しダンスグループではコンテストで賞をもらった経歴もあります。彼女は観客の方に楽しんでもらい喜びをもたらす事に情熱を持っています。Michiの明るい性格と相手がつい微笑んでしまうような笑顔に人は自然と惹かれてしまいます。とにかく一緒にいて楽しい人なのです！</p>
<h2>プロジェクトについて：</h2>
<p>Michiがニューヨークそしてバンクーバーに滞在しボーカルトレーニングを受けている時に彼女と同じ情熱や想いを持つミュージシャン達と巡り会い、このプロジェクトを共に始動させました。彼らはアップテンポな曲からダンスソングそしてバラードなどさまざまな曲が盛り込まれた７曲のJ-popソングを作りレコーディングしました。そしてこれらの曲をCDにしたいと考えています。</p>
<h2>情熱：</h2>
<p>音楽やパフォーマンスを通して観客の人達に楽しく前向きになってもらえる事が彼女の喜びです。日本人は社会の中で沢山のプレッシャーを背負っていますそれは若い世代にも例外ではありません。ですから希望の言葉や音楽を聴き励まされる事が日本の人達の日々の生活にとって必要だと思っています。</p>
<p>東日本を襲った津波や原発災害の後、日本のニュースが引き続き取り上げられみなさんもそれはご存知だと思います。この災害後、更なるプレッシャーが日本の人達に圧し掛かりました。Michiはそんな日本の人達そして世界中の人達を少しでも励ましたいと願っています。</p>
<h2>これまでの進行状況：</h2>
<p>作業の大半は終わっています。終了している作業：</p>
<ul>
<li>全ての曲のレコーディング</li>
<li>写真撮影</li>
<li>CDジャケットのグラフィックデザイン</li>
<li>大まかなミキシング、編曲作業</li>
</ul>
<h2>これからの作業：</h2>

<li>ミキシング</li>
<li>マスタリング</li>
<li>CDプレス、製造</li>
<li>流通、マーケティング-　楽曲を広める事！</li>
</ul>
<h2>サポートに関して：</h2>
<p>みなさんが実際どのようにこのプロジェクトにご協力して頂けるのかをご紹介します。それには２つの方法があります。</p>
<h3>   1]  資金的な援助</h3>
<p>MichiがCDを完成させる為には＄7,500 の資金を募らなければなりません。</p>

Michiってどんな人？
日本で活動する歌手。幼少の頃から歌や演技が大好きだった彼女はミュージカルにも出演しダンスグループではコンテストで賞をもらった経歴もあります。彼女は観客の方に楽しんでもらい喜びをもたらす事に情熱を持っています。Michiの明るい性格と相手がつい微笑んでしまうような笑顔に人は自然と惹かれてしまいます。とにかく一緒にいて楽しい人なのです！
プロジェクトについて：
Michiがニューヨークそしてバンクーバーに滞在しボーカルトレーニングを受けている時に彼女と同じ情熱や想いを持つミュージシャン達と巡り会い、このプロジェクトを共に始動させました。彼らはアップテンポな曲からダンスソングそしてバラードなどさまざまな曲が盛り込まれた７曲のJ-popソングを作りレコーディングしました。そしてこれらの曲をCDにしたいと考えています。
情熱：
音楽やパフォーマンスを通して観客の人達に楽しく前向きになってもらえる事が彼女の喜びです。日本人は社会の中で沢山のプレッシャーを背負っていますそれは若い世代にも例外ではありません。ですから希望の言葉や音楽を聴き励まされる事が日本の人達の日々の生活にとって必要だと思っています。
東日本を襲った津波や原発災害の後、日本のニュースが引き続き取り上げられみなさんもそれはご存知だと思います。この災害後、更なるプレッシャーが日本の人達に圧し掛かりました。Michiはそんな日本の人達そして世界中の人達を少しでも励ましたいと願っています。
これまでの進行状況：
作業の大半は終わっています。終了している作業：

全ての曲のレコーディング
写真撮影
CDジャケットのグラフィックデザイン
大まかなミキシング、編曲作業

これからの作業：

ミキシング
マスタリング
CDプレス、製造
流通、マーケティング-　楽曲を広める事！

サポートに関して：
みなさんが実際どのようにこのプロジェクトにご協力して頂けるのかをご紹介します。それには２つの方法があります。
   1]  資金的な援助
MichiがCDを完成させる為には＄7,500 の資金を募らなければなりません。
こちらがその内訳です。

ミキシング = $5,500
マスタリング = $1,000
CDプレス = $1,000

これは音源及びCD製作に必要な費用ですがもし目標額である$7,500以上の資金を募る事ができた場合にはマーケティング、プロモーション費用の為にあてられます。

<h3>RF SHANNON, COMMUNITAS RNB</h3>
<p>RF SHANNON's music gets to the Spirit of a people, a place, a thing, and an idea that has happened, is happening, and will happen again.</p>
<p>We have been playing together in this incarnation since February 2013, and we believe that good things happen very quickly. Help us move it up and shake it down.</p>
<p>'Communitas' is the nitty gritty feeling of what it is like to live here with other people, and we want to create a feeling through music that engages an exchange of real things and true senses. We have been told that our songs conjure images of the southwest and the deep south, which is the crossroads of where we're from. We know this place and want to tell its story. The deserts, the dustbowls, the woods, the water... the streets.</p>

<p><strong>Hello Everyone!!!</strong></p>
<p>My name is Miguel Atwood-Ferguson and I am a multi-instrumentalist, composer, arranger, music director, producer, DJ, and educator.  I am raising money to finish recording my first solo album (working title: <em>Les Jardins Mystiques</em>) as well as a string quartet record of cinematic improvisations with my string quartet, <em>Quartetto Fantastico</em>. I am unbelievably excited to share the love in my heart with the world through music! I appreciate your help in bringing this dream and vision to life!</p>
<p><strong><em>Les Jardins Mystiques </em>Special Guests<em>: </em></strong></p>
<p>Austin Peralta, Bilal, Chris 'Daddy' Dave, Coco (Quadron), Deantoni Parks, Georgia Anne Muldrow, Herbie Hancock, James Gadson, JRocc, Karriem Riggins, Leon Ware, Madlib, Marie Daulne (Zap Mama), Mia Doi Todd, Nai Palm (Hiatus Kaiyote), and Seu Jorge to name a few.</p>
<p><strong>Quartetto Fantastico:</strong></p>
<p>Chris Woods (violin)</p>
<p>Paul Cartwright (violin)</p>
<p>Miguel Atwood-Ferguson (viola)</p>
<p>Peter Jacobson (cello)</p>
<p><strong>Backstory:</strong></p>
<p>I grew up in beautiful Topanga Canyon, tucked away in the hills of Los Angeles County, to a diverse and artistic family of musicians and educators. Despite playing music my entire life, performing thousands of concerts and recording on well over 500 records, films/tv shows and commercials, I have not been able to afford the time and money needed to record my own albums. Even though my path as a musician has been an awesome and emotionally fulfilling journey, most of my gigs don’t pay enough for me to make ends meet, let alone build a sustainable foundation to one day raise my own family.</p>
<p>Currently, as a freelance artist between unpaid gigs, I have no money and have not even been able to pay my own rent the last two months… In my experience, in most cases, the gigs that pay the best are often the least creatively fulfilling, and the most fulfilling gigs from a creative and emotional perspective pay either nothing, or an extremely small amount.</p>
<p>This is the most critical time so far in my entire life and with your help, I will be able to seriously break through with the production of my own recorded work!!!</p>
<p><strong>Surviving as a Creative artist:</strong></p>
<p>The one thing I love most in life is creating and performing music that touches people’s souls. As a musician focused on making incredibly well-crafted, soulful, diverse and inspiring music, I’ve given my life towards this cause by working on average 12-20 hrs everyday. I absolutely LOVE what I do, but would like to finally focus on and be able to sustainably create my own music with your help!</p>
<p>As human beings, we all love music so much! But, unfortunately, it is very difficult for many creative musicians like myself to survive in the world. I have done my very best to utilize as much heart and wisdom possible as I continue to grow as a human being and artist, and have now come to a place where I’m humbly looking to the support of you- new and old friends around the world who will join me in launching the next step of my music.</p>
<p>This all is what has led me to being here with you now!</p>
<p><strong>This Indie Gogo campaign will allow me to:</strong></p>
<p>*Finish my first solo album (a double album on the LA-based indie record label Brainfeeder). The working title is ‘Les Jardins Mystiques’ (The Mystical Gardens).</p>
<p>*Finish my first record with my string quartet Quartetto Fantastico (this will also be a double album and will be released independently by us and is 100% comprised of sublime and diverse cinematic improvisations).</p>
<p>*Have living expenses needed to complete these albums.</p>
<p>*Hire a small documentation crew that will document aspects of the making of both of these historic albums. This will be a huge help towards creating more future opportunities for myself and my string quartet.</p>
<p>*Pay for food at my Brainfeeder recording sessions to feed the multitude of musicians that I will be hiring to record with me.</p>
<p>*Purchase/fix gear that is needed to complete these albums and tour around the world.</p>
<p>*Emerge as the solo musician doing the work that I feel I was born to do.</p>
<p>*Be used as an example to other creative musicians that are also struggling to manifest their dreams.</p>
<p>*Donate 10% of my earnings from my solo Brainfeeder album as well as donate 10% of Quartetto Fantastico’s earnings to worthy charities for the rest of our lives.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some of the charities that we will be donating to initially are:</p>

</div></div>","Hello Everyone!!!
My name is Miguel Atwood-Ferguson and I am a multi-instrumentalist, composer, arranger, music director, producer, DJ, and educator.  I am raising money to finish recording my first solo album (working title: Les Jardins Mystiques) as well as a string quartet record of cinematic improvisations with my string quartet, Quartetto Fantastico. I am unbelievably excited to share the love in my heart with the world through music! I appreciate your help in bringing this dream and vision to life!
Les Jardins Mystiques Special Guests: 
Austin Peralta, Bilal, Chris 'Daddy' Dave, Coco (Quadron), Deantoni Parks, Georgia Anne Muldrow, Herbie Hancock, James Gadson, JRocc, Karriem Riggins, Leon Ware, Madlib, Marie Daulne (Zap Mama), Mia Doi Todd, Nai Palm (Hiatus Kaiyote), and Seu Jorge to name a few.
Quartetto Fantastico:
Chris Woods (violin)
Paul Cartwright (violin)
Miguel Atwood-Ferguson (viola)
Peter Jacobson (cello)
Backstory:
I grew up in beautiful Topanga Canyon, tucked away in the hills of Los Angeles County, to a diverse and artistic family of musicians and educators. Despite playing music my entire life, performing thousands of concerts and recording on well over 500 records, films/tv shows and commercials, I have not been able to afford the time and money needed to record my own albums. Even though my path as a musician has been an awesome and emotionally fulfilling journey, most of my gigs don’t pay enough for me to make ends meet, let alone build a sustainable foundation to one day raise my own family.
Currently, as a freelance artist between unpaid gigs, I have no money and have not even been able to pay my own rent the last two months… In my experience, in most cases, the gigs that pay the best are often the least creatively fulfilling, and the most fulfilling gigs from a creative and emotional perspective pay either nothing, or an extremely small amount.
This is the most critical time so far in my entire life and with your help, I will be able to seriously break through with the production of my own recorded work!!!
Surviving as a Creative artist:
The one thing I love most in life is creating and performing music that touches people’s souls. As a musician focused on making incredibly well-crafted, soulful, diverse and inspiring music, I’ve given my life towards this cause by working on average 12-20 hrs everyday. I absolutely LOVE what I do, but would like to finally focus on and be able to sustainably create my own music with your help!
As human beings, we all love music so much! But, unfortunately, it is very difficult for many creative musicians like myself to survive in the world. I have done my very best to utilize as much heart and wisdom possible as I continue to grow as a human being and artist, and have now come to a place where I’m humbly looking to the support of you- new and old friends around the world who will join me in launching the next step of my music.
This all is what has led me to being here with you now!
This Indie Gogo campaign will allow me to:
*Finish my first solo album (a double album on the LA-based indie record label Brainfeeder). The working title is ‘Les Jardins Mystiques’ (The Mystical Gardens).
*Finish my first record with my string quartet Quartetto Fantastico (this will also be a double album and will be released independently by us and is 100% comprised of sublime and diverse cinematic improvisations).
*Have living expenses needed to complete these albums.
*Hire a small documentation crew that will document aspects of the making of both of these historic albums. This will be a huge help towards creating more future opportunities for myself and my string quartet.
*Pay for food at my Brainfeeder recording sessions to feed the multitude of musicians that I will be hiring to record with me.
*Purchase/fix gear that is needed to complete these albums and tour around the world.
*Emerge as the solo musician doing the work that I feel I was born to do.
*Be used as an example to other creative musicians that are also struggling to manifest their dreams.
*Donate 10% of my earnings from my solo Brainfeeder album as well as donate 10% of Quartetto Fantastico’s earnings to worthy charities for the rest of our lives.
 
Some of the charities that we will be donating to initially are:
http://www.hearmehub.com/

http://www.donorschoose.org/
http://www.cff.org/

<p><b>             REMEMBERING FRANK SINATRA: THE CAPITOL YEARS</b></p>
<p><b>                                       STARRING TIMOTHY O'KEEFE</b></p>
<p><b>         TV PERSONALITY AND INTERNATIONAL RECORDING ARTIST</b></p>
<p>Hi, my name is Timothy O'Keefe.  <b>I need
your help</b>.  I have had this dream of
doing this show for more than 15 years.  It's
time!  <b>But I can't do it without your help.</b></p>
<p><b>I fell in love with this music</b> when I was young like
many of you.  Nobody does this music
better than Frank Sinatra.  I chose this
period while at <b>Capitol Records</b> <b>from 1953 to 1961</b> because this was the <b>most powerful</b> time in his career.  Full of <b>great stories and magnificent music
</b>with the help of iconic music men like Nelson Riddle, Rodgers and Hart, Cole Porter, Sammy Cahn and many more.</p>
<p>I will be accompanied by a <b>17 piece BIG BAND</b> and lots of images to tell the story.</p>
<p>We will design, stage and premier the production in my
home town of <b>Asheville, NC</b> before we
take it <b>across the country</b>.  <b>With your help</b> we will be coming to a
<b>Performing Arts Theatre near you.</b></p>
<p>And we are currently in the studio working on a
<b>companion CD</b> for the show with the same title.</p>
<p>Thank you for your support and God Bless you.</p>
<p>Timothy</p>
<p><b>                                                                BIO </b></p>
<p>From Alan Sewell on<b><i> The
Young and the Restless</i></b> and Doctor Erickson on  <b><i>Days Of Our Lives</i></b>, <b><i>Timothy</i></b>
<b>O’Keefe’s</b> varied and exciting career
has led him down a trail as Television and Film actor, recording artist,
musical entertainer, director, stage actor and cruise ship headliner. </p>
<p>Along with his soap opera
roles, he was seen as Foster Wolfe with Chad Everett on ABC’s <b><i>McKenna.</i></b>
He has guest-starred in numerous TV series such as <b><i>Fantasy Island, Quincy, Battle
Star Galactica, CHiPS, Buck Rogers, McClain’s Law</i></b><b></b><i>with James Arness</i><b><i>,</i></b> and numerous others<i>.  </i></p>
<p>As a singer and entertainer,
his nightclub dates include Las Vegas and Reno.  <b>O’Keefe</b>
was a frequent guest on the <b><i>Tonight Show </i></b>and the popular <b><i>Merv
Griffin Show</i></b>.  He received rave
reviews for his <b>CD</b>, ""<i>The
Best Is Yet To Come"".</i></p>
<p><b>                                        </b></p>
<p><b>                                          DESCRIPTION OF SHOW</b></p>
<h1>Here, in a special
tribute, Timothy O’Keefe offers a fascinating and entertaining look at the life
of Frank Sinatra - the
singer, the actor, and the man. </h1>
<p>You’ll take a voyage
through Frank’s life; his fall from grace --- his amazing recovery in <b>FROM HERE TO ETERNITY</b> --- the beginning
of <b>Las Vegas</b> --- the birth of an
artistic union with <b>Nelson Riddle</b>
that survived over four decades --- the making of a major film star --- the <b>Rat Pack </b>--- superstardom and, of
course, we can’t forget <b>Ava.</b></p>
<p>This is <b>not an impersonator or lookalike show</b>,
but an affectionate musical and biographical tribute to one of the greatest
entertainers of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century by what the <b>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</b> labeled, <b>“…<u>A
WORLD CLASS SINGER</u>.”</b></p>
<p>The <b>LA TIMES</b> had this to say about Mr. O’Keefe
, ""... follows in the footsteps of great singers like Tony Bennett.""</p>
<p>The <b>SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE</b> said,
""O'Keefe has the ability to connect with his audience in a way that
escapes many singers...not  just a great
voice.""</p>
<h1>Timothy will take you
through works of Cole Porter, the Gershwins, Sammy Cahn, Rodgers and Hart, Jimmy Van Huesen and many others --- Musical giants who helped shape the body of work
that made Francis Albert Sinatra so popular.</h1>

                                       STARRING TIMOTHY O'KEEFE
         TV PERSONALITY AND INTERNATIONAL RECORDING ARTIST
Hi, my name is Timothy O'Keefe.  I need
your help.  I have had this dream of
doing this show for more than 15 years.  It's
time!  But I can't do it without your help.
I fell in love with this music when I was young like
many of you.  Nobody does this music
better than Frank Sinatra.  I chose this
period while at Capitol Records from 1953 to 1961 because this was the most powerful time in his career.  Full of great stories and magnificent music
with the help of iconic music men like Nelson Riddle, Rodgers and Hart, Cole Porter, Sammy Cahn and many more.
I will be accompanied by a 17 piece BIG BAND and lots of images to tell the story.
We will design, stage and premier the production in my
home town of Asheville, NC before we
take it across the country.  With your help we will be coming to a
Performing Arts Theatre near you.
And we are currently in the studio working on a
companion CD for the show with the same title.
Thank you for your support and God Bless you.
Timothy
                                                                BIO 
From Alan Sewell on The
Young and the Restless and Doctor Erickson on  Days Of Our Lives, Timothy
O’Keefe’s varied and exciting career
has led him down a trail as Television and Film actor, recording artist,
musical entertainer, director, stage actor and cruise ship headliner. 
Along with his soap opera
roles, he was seen as Foster Wolfe with Chad Everett on ABC’s McKenna.
He has guest-starred in numerous TV series such as Fantasy Island, Quincy, Battle
Star Galactica, CHiPS, Buck Rogers, McClain’s Lawwith James Arness, and numerous others.  
As a singer and entertainer,
his nightclub dates include Las Vegas and Reno.  O’Keefe
was a frequent guest on the Tonight Show and the popular Merv
Griffin Show.  He received rave
reviews for his CD, ""The
Best Is Yet To Come"".
                                        
                                          DESCRIPTION OF SHOW
Here, in a special
tribute, Timothy O’Keefe offers a fascinating and entertaining look at the life
of Frank Sinatra - the
singer, the actor, and the man. 
You’ll take a voyage
through Frank’s life; his fall from grace --- his amazing recovery in FROM HERE TO ETERNITY --- the beginning
of Las Vegas --- the birth of an
artistic union with Nelson Riddle
that survived over four decades --- the making of a major film star --- the Rat Pack --- superstardom and, of
course, we can’t forget Ava.
This is not an impersonator or lookalike show,
but an affectionate musical and biographical tribute to one of the greatest
entertainers of the 20th Century by what the CHICAGO TRIBUNE labeled, “…A
WORLD CLASS SINGER.”
The LA TIMES had this to say about Mr. O’Keefe
, ""... follows in the footsteps of great singers like Tony Bennett.""
The SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE said,
""O'Keefe has the ability to connect with his audience in a way that
escapes many singers...not  just a great
voice.""
Timothy will take you
through works of Cole Porter, the Gershwins, Sammy Cahn, Rodgers and Hart, Jimmy Van Huesen and many others --- Musical giants who helped shape the body of work
that made Francis Albert Sinatra so popular.

</h3><p><b><i></i><b><i>CRISTY KESSLER is alive because she became an effective patient 
advocate for herself. Her 5 STEPS Principles* along with the strategies 
she developed can make a difference for you or your loved ones.</i></b><i> Inspired by her personal medical journey, our mission is to empower others to speak and act for themselves and loved ones when medical needs arise. </i></b></p>
<p></p><p>She is alive only because on March 21, 2011,  after years of pain, fatigue, frustration, and a steadfast fight for a cure that had been denied by her insurance and which was prohibited in the United States by the FDA, she was the recipient of an autologous stem cell transplant. This treatment eliminated three concurrent autoimmune diseases which she had been told would end her life within months. <br/></p><p>Through her own self-advocacy strategies and the support of a powerful team of physicians, she found the treatment that could save her life. But because it was extremely expensive and had to be done outside of the United States, fund-raising efforts by her family and friends helped make it possible.  Cristy determined that the best way to thank those who 
helped her was to pay it forward by sharing her successful strategies with others 
who face difficult medical challenges. <br/></p><p>As a first step in meeting that goal, Cristy published <i><a href=""http://bit.ly/1aRaudc%20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">5 S.T.E.P.S. to Being Your Own Patient Advocate</a></i>, a book that tells the powerful story of her medical journey—a journey 
which took her from certain death to recovery and restoration, from 
waiting to die to learning to live. <br/></p><p>Whether you, someone you love, or a perfect stranger is struggling with medical challenges and finding no answers, Cristy's Five STEPS can provide the strategies to build an effective team to <i>find and fund</i> needed diagnoses and treatment.  With your support, she will make a difference for those who find themselves navigating a complex and often confusing medical maze for themselves or for someone they love. <br/></p><p>In pursuing her passion for paying it forward, Cristy urges everyone, whether healthy or ill, to adopt this mantra, <b>My Health. My Body. My Voice</b>. <i>You</i> are the expert on <i>you</i>, and you owe it to yourself to take charge of your health care.  <br/></p><p>In the gallery are videos and pictures that not only chronicle Cristy's story, but there are video interviews with a young couple who are just beginning their medical journey together with Cristy's guidance and the strategies described in the book. <br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p></p><p>This campaign will fund a book tour from July 4-July 16 in four states (Confirmed for Illinois, Tennessee, South Carolina and Georgia.)

It was a little difficult to relax during the period that followed the first album, but now we are eager to start the next one. The search for new ideas and new sounds begin to sparkle and rekindle the sacred fire within us :) After this first Album experience, we have refined our references and choice in the color we want to give to this new album, we really believe in it and we want to share with you. While labels are increasingly lost in the world of music, we have decided to no longer be constrained by the blinders of a record. And we always wanted to make music for clubbing fans. Our philosophy is a free music reaching as many people as possible through clubs and festivals. Make people dance and dream has always been our motivation. Fundraising with INDIEGOGO allow us to fully invest ourselves in this new album without any constraints or other artistic director or producer. We can work on our own productions as we understand it, work with people we want, reserve the studio we love and entirety supervise the work: from composition, mixing, mastering, graphic, manufacturing, to promoting and communication. You have the chance to create with us a memorable album reflecting our electro-house universe.

Who are we?
We are both passionate about music since our childhood. Growing up, we had many influences such as Hip-Hop U.S., Rock, Reggae, House music, Electro and everything that make people dance . Our experiences of our eclectic DJ and producer led us to work with people prestigious world music.

<h3>My Idea &amp; Dream</h3>
<p>I am 29 years old from Manchester, UK. My story isn't exactly a straightforward one. I am a Struggling Musician who has so much to say and do with my material if only had the kickstart to do so. Obviously to ask you guys to fund my project it is only fair you recieve my upmost honesty so although this might hinder my chances of a great kickstart I will tell you about my self, for anymore details please don't hesitate to contact me. Here goes, In August 2012 I was released from prison after serving an 8 year sentence for possessing a firearm and supplying drugs. Whilst in prison I made huge changes to my life, I educated myself and built up a great relationship again with all my family which continues to flourish. Whilst in prison I found the real music in me. I have always played guitar and sang but was unaware unitill I had the time to practise, that I could write. After years of proving I had turned my life in a completely different direction, I was sent to an open prison where I formed a band with other musicians, we played gigs in the prison and all around the surrounding community to raise funds for local charities, mainly drug rehabilitation charities etc, connected to anti-reoffending. </p>
<p>At Present I (for obvious reasons) am struggling more than most in this economy to find a job. Music is my passion and something I don't just want to do for a living but feel that I 'have to' do. I am currently playing small venues all over Manchester but struggling to get together enough money for a demo recording. I have arranged a studio, promotion, suport gigs and much larger venues and publicity, all of which cannot go ahead without a demo (promo) recording of my material.</p>
<p>With the funding I am asking for, there is no two ways about it, A fantastic career will be kickstarted, I can put the promo out to the powers who can get me into the music world and I can finally put my dream into reality. I don't want it handed to me on a plate, I work very very hard at it and just need a kickstart, With this promo I will 100% get the gigs and recognition I need to Fund an Album which will be a major major shot at a fantastic career.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Funding &amp; its use</h3>
<p>I need £500. There is no complex explanation. The studio in Manchester I intend to use are ready for me, It will cost me £300 for the 2 days I need to record, edit and produce a 3 track CD with £200 to make copies for promotion. It really is as simple as that. I'll even be getting a buss with my guitars etc to the studio to save money. :)</p>
<p>Perks, As you can see, At this moment I have nothing Major to offer, However, I promise this, Every funder for my project will get full mention in My promo sleeve, They will also get a hard copy of the CD mailed to them. And I My main sleeve in the upcoming Album will consist of the funders own projects and details. And the person I am, I will never EVER forget you. Even if I make it to the top which I intend to, My amateur recording of my demo received over 12,000 views in the first 24 hours. :) My material is good enough and being recognised in the songwriting circles.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>The Future Plan</strong></h2>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Regardless, I WILL end up recording my Album and Coming from the life experiences I've had, I 100% will always dedicate a lot of time to anti-drug and gun crime charities. Percentages of my earnings from my music will ALWAYS go to these causes as it really does help with youth projects and many more intervention and aftercare projects and It also is a way for me to give back to the communities I once let down.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>If you can't donate, please at least have a look at my music and pages. They are in their infancy but WILL amount to something. I work too hard for it not too. Bless anyone who is or is even thinking of contributing. I have only just been introduced to this sort of funding method and I fully intend in the future to give a lot back on here myself. Please feel free to contact me all call me regarding any queries you may have 07432084745. I am just an average guy from an average family persuing his dream, please be the person to help me. :)</p>

Back by patriotic demand, “Letters Home: A Memorial Day Remembrance Concert” was uniquely created in 2011 for the community to remember soldiers of the past, present and future by reciting actual letters written home from local servicemen and women of the Fox Valley area. With beautiful musical tapestry by select members of the Fox Valley Concert Band, Fox Valley Rep actors will weave in soldier’s letters written to friends and family during their time of service in two performances over Memorial day weekend.
 
Last year’s concert featured World War II love letters from the parents of Sarah Giachino, co-founder of Fox Valley Troop Support Inc. Sarah's father, Purple Heart recipient Charles Hardman, was a Lieutenant in the Army, 117th Infantry, 30th Division.  The reciting of these letters, together with music, formed a powerful event of remembrance and celebration.
“This year, we’ve already been in contact with a contract officer named Luke, First Lieutenant in Chaos Troop of the First Squadron of the 40th Cavalry Regiment. Luke’s letters home to wife Ariel, a Naperville native, will be featured in this memorable concert,”says Fox Valley Rep Artistic Director John Gawlik. “This year’s program will also include letters representing Vietnam and the Korean conflicts.”

What We Need & How Your Support Helps!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are a legitimate 501(c)(3) nonprofit and run the Marching Cobras as an open after school program for pre-teens and teens to have constructive to do  after school/</p>
<p><em>Our band director 's passion for kids and music helped him start the Marching Cobras in 2009 and he runs a structured and disciplined program where kids have expectations and learn a skill. We partner with parents so that they have a 2nd set of eyes making sure their kids stay on the right track and keep their grades up.</em></p>
<p>This campaign is so very important for us because our equipment is old and worn.  At one of our parades in March, a leg rest fell off, but our kids never miss a beat and just kept on drumming while a staff member scooped up the piece. Another one has no more cushion in his leg rest so it is bothersome on his thigh, but he does his job and keeps up with the band. <strong>THESE KIDS ARE EXTREMELY DEDICATED TO THE BAND!</strong>  In another parade in March, a doctor noticed that the skin on one of our bass drums was broken but he loved our sound. He offered to puchase for us a new bass drum and told us to order it and send him the invoice! We are so grateful to him! Thanks Dr. Sullivan!</p>
<p>By donors offering even $1, every dollar goes directly to the purchase of quality equipment for our bandmembers so that they can deliver great a great sound to the crowds.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>We need about $3500 as a start to get a few new snares and bass drums for the kids that don't hurt their legs to play. We always have to carry bandaids to parades.  : (</p>
<p>Even if we don't meet our goal, which we hope we will, every penny collected will buy whatever drum(s) we can afford.</p>
</div>
<div>

</div></div>","Short Summary
We are a legitimate 501(c)(3) nonprofit and run the Marching Cobras as an open after school program for pre-teens and teens to have constructive to do  after school/
Our band director 's passion for kids and music helped him start the Marching Cobras in 2009 and he runs a structured and disciplined program where kids have expectations and learn a skill. We partner with parents so that they have a 2nd set of eyes making sure their kids stay on the right track and keep their grades up.
This campaign is so very important for us because our equipment is old and worn.  At one of our parades in March, a leg rest fell off, but our kids never miss a beat and just kept on drumming while a staff member scooped up the piece. Another one has no more cushion in his leg rest so it is bothersome on his thigh, but he does his job and keeps up with the band. THESE KIDS ARE EXTREMELY DEDICATED TO THE BAND!  In another parade in March, a doctor noticed that the skin on one of our bass drums was broken but he loved our sound. He offered to puchase for us a new bass drum and told us to order it and send him the invoice! We are so grateful to him! Thanks Dr. Sullivan!
By donors offering even $1, every dollar goes directly to the purchase of quality equipment for our bandmembers so that they can deliver great a great sound to the crowds.


What We Need 
We need about $3500 as a start to get a few new snares and bass drums for the kids that don't hurt their legs to play. We always have to carry bandaids to parades.  : (
Even if we don't meet our goal, which we hope we will, every penny collected will buy whatever drum(s) we can afford.


The Impact On The Kids
No amount is too little to contribute. We appreciate EVERY donation big and small because it puts us one step closer to purchasing decent equipment where the kids will be more comfortable walking those long parades, playing and doing the choreography without discomfort.

<p><b>Welcome!</b></p>
<p>Hello everyone! Thanks for visiting my
campaign.  My name is Cluny Macpherson.  I am a singer, songwriter and
multi-instrumentalist based in Victoria, BC, Canada.  In the last ten years, I’ve been involved in
numerous projects and I’m a well-known figure in the Victoria music scene.  My current project is a band called the
Mighty Moonshiners.  Our repertoire draws
heavily from bluegrass, blues, jazz and folk traditions.  We’re in the fourth year of our residency at
Swans Brewpub in Victoria.  Please take a
minute to visit our website at: <a href=""http://www.moonshinersbluegrass.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.moonshinersbluegrass.ca</a></p>
<p>Now, I’m poised to begin a recording
project with award winning producer, Adrian Dolan (Ruth Moody Band, The Wailin’
Jennys, The Bills, Outlaw Social, Jenny Ritter Band, The Sweet Lowdown).  I’m so excited! The project will consist of
seven songs composed by myself and feature Adrian’s instrumental and producing
talents as well as those of Oliver Swain (Outlaw Social, Red Stick Ramblers,
The Bills) on bass and Mick Baker (The Fairmonts) on mandolin.  It will be recorded at Baker Studios in
Victoria, which has been the venue for numerous award-winning albums.  This project is the culmination of all of my
efforts thus far as a musician.  It
represents my life’s work up to this point and its success depends in part on
your support.</p>
<p><b>Let me
break it down:</b></p>
<p>The approximate projected cost of this
recording is as follows as per the budget drafted by my producer:</p>
<p>3000.00 for engineering and mixing</p>
<p>2100.00 for studio rental</p>
<p>420.00 for mastering</p>
<p>450.00 for equipment rental</p>
<p>I’ve also budgeted 1200.00 for graphic design of the album cover and
manufacture of the album.</p>
<p>I’ve managed to put together enough for a
deposit of 1200.00 in order to secure my time in the studio and secure the
services of my producer.  I will
personally cover some additional costs such as paying the musicians for their
work on the sessions and am applying for a recording grant in order to help
fund the project.  </p>
<p>The rewards for your contribution are
varied.  Like most other crowdfunding
campaigns for recording projects, I’m offering pre-sales of the album.  This is a good, low commitment way to help it
along.  I also want to mention, however,
that cooking is one of my stronger suits. 
Think how great it would be to have me come and make you brunch.  Mmmm. 
Hollandaise.</p>
<p><b>One
final note</b></p>
<p>The material I’m recording is very dear to
me and also holds some meaning for the folks in the Victoria area who have
heard it.  People seem to think it’s
pretty good! I’m hoping that this recording will find its way to a wider
audience and you can help make that happen! Who knows, maybe one of my songs is
your favourite song and you just don’t know it yet. Probably.</p>
<p>We live in tough times and I recognize that some of you are keen to help,
yet unable to make a financial contribution. 
That’s okay! I appreciate all forms of support including sharing the
campaign with your friends.  Kind words
are also nice.</p><p>Please stay tuned for updates! I'll be releasing a video of one of my songs before the campaign ends so you can check in on our progress.  I think this whole
endeavour is going to be pretty great and I’d be really grateful for your
participation.  Thanks again for visiting!</p>

Almost 6 years ago on July 6th 2008, I was in a diving accident that rendered me a C5 Quadriplegic, meaning I've spent that time in a wheelchair. Before the accident, I was a Pianist with the hopes of making music for the rest of my days. My injury put those dreams on hold, because I lost the ability to use my hands. So for the first 3 years out of my injury I figured I wouldn't be able to make music my career since I had lost the most essential part of my ability to create music. </p><p>It wasn't until December 2011 that I discovered a new instrument, my voice. I've always sang, even after my accident. But I never felt attached to the sound that came out of my mouth. On the day I found my voice I was singing along to Ray LaMontagne and Tom Waits, and I found a sound that I loved and felt a connection to. So I started writing a song, our first track on the album, ""This"". Once I finished the song I hit up some friends of mine who I knew not only played instruments, but played them well. </p><p><b></b></p><p><b><b>The Project</b></b></p><p>After almost 2 years of working 
together, we are working on our debut full-length album called Beautiful
 Gone Wrong. Most of these songs started out on my computer. Some of the
 songs were entirely written by me, and some of the songs I came up with
 a simple structure and chord progression then brought it to the band 
who put their own flavor on it. Like butter or hot sauce or something 
like that.</p><p>Personally, this is my dream. It's my dream to 
write music with some cool people for the rest of my days. Maybe along 
the way do some traveling and play my music for the people who need to 
hear it. But this isn't just my dream anymore, this is 6 other people's 
dream who are as much a part of this as I am. But we can't do it on our 
own.</p><p><b><b>The Money</b></b></p><p>This is where you guys come in. If you love us give us  money! <br/>No,
 but in all seriousness if you have even a dollar to spare that can 
help. If we get 100 of those 1 dollar donations, that's enough for us to
 get 1 song recorded! So literally anything you can spare, we will be 
eternally grateful!<br/></p><p>The money we're raising will go to a few different things.</p><p>First,
 to the actual recording process. Laying down tracks, the mixing of 
those tracks to make everything sound all sparkly and fun and then to 
the mastering of the tracks, which will make everything radio ready!<br/></p><p>Second, to the production of CDs and band 
merchandise. If you've ever been to a Treading North show, we never have
 anything to give our fans. No music, no shirts, nothing for you guys to
 remember us by. And we don't want you to be sad!</p><p>Third, 
whatever is left will go to one of three things. More merch, band 
equipment, or we're gonna convert it all into dollar bills and throw it 
off the Lightrail bridge that goes over Lake St. We probably won't do 
the latter, but we will definitely do one of the first 2. I'm just 
trying to be interesting.</p><p>So, if you have some money to spare 
and you didn't become bored or offended by my ramblings about my band 
and our project, we will gushingly welcome your donations. If you have 
no money to spare and are excited about our project, please share the 
link to this page on your Facebook, Twitter, Email or any other weird 
Social Network you're a part of. Like Tumblr, what is that? If you hate 
the idea of giving us money because I offended you or you just hate me

But then one day we walked in on them doing something and they frantically started covering their bodies trying to hide something from us. Then it hit me, they're superheroes!

Tyler is probably the most normal person in the band.

He plays guitar on the same level that Miles does. Though Miles has always had his rare musical talent because of where he came from, we believe Doug's talent was actually given to him. He's only able to describe it in small detail, but Doug believes he was abducted by aliens a few years ago and thinks aliens programmed his brain with insane musical abilities. It would also explain why he's so nervous at shows.

But then one day we walked in on them doing something and they frantically started covering their bodies trying to hide something from us. Then it hit me, they're superheroes! They were trying to cover their costumes! Which also explains their outlandish musical abilities.Fifth is Tyler ""Frosty"" Croat. Tyler is probably the most normal person in the band. Sure he's had his run ins with the law (ask him about the Octopus and the Canine Unit at the Red Lobster sometime, it's a great story), the occasional ""trip up north to visit the fam"" and despite being regularly dipped in bleach throughout his childhood. He somehow, despite all of his normalities, PLAYS SOME OF THE SEXIEST SAXOPHONE YOU WILL EVER HEAR.Last but the furthest thing from the least, is ""Licker/Liqour"" Doug Loll, the BBQ Sauce, the sugar on top, the whipped cream of our music. He plays guitar on the same level that Miles does. Though Miles has always had his rare musical talent because of where he came from, we believe Doug's talent was actually given to him. He's only able to describe it in small detail, but Doug believes he was abducted by aliens a few years ago and thinks aliens programmed his brain with insane musical abilities. It would also explain why he's so nervous at shows. All those lights!And here is me. That's all.Shout-out to Tony Schurbon and Adam Paulus.They recorded us, and would be done mixing us but we are being extremely picky and probably driving them crazy...we love them for putting up with us and making our music possible!!! If you ever see them, please give them a hug.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

Bear’s been traveling the world as Burning Man’s roving Social Alchemist, working to connect communities in new and novel ways... but as much as he loves organizing through network and hands-on “pitching,” he’s also been deeply honing his craft as a musician -- and for him, this album is the essence of the storytelling that has permeated from his global experiences.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Music has always been a huge part of Bear’s life -- he sung opera as a child, was bugle boy at camp, and picked up the guitar at 13 on a childhood expedition from Scarsdale, New York to the Utah Desert.

<p dir=""ltr""><span>And now his traveling has brought him to the point of making this album. In June of 2012, Bear reconnected with Doce Luna (the producer of ""Radio Beartopia,"") a bass player from an Obama benefit he had played in New York City four years earlier, at an Obama benefit . Luna reached out to Bear via Facebook to join him at the Bold Academy - a personal accelerator, “real life school for superheroes,” in Boulder, Colorado. Luna is a deeply steeped and studied musician, having gotten a degree in jazz performance at the Manhattan School of Music, where he performed an eclectic mix of jazz, classical, rock and electronic music, which culminated in a Latin Grammy nomination for his work with the Manhattan School of Music Afro-Cuban Jazz Orchestra. After spending years as a professional bassist - his calling - he tragically, in a freak accident, paralyzed his left hand, a condition that doctors said was likely permanent. This accident put a sudden stop to his performing career, and he reached out to Bear in need of life recalibration.  </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Not a day later, Luna arrived in Boulder, and him and Bear began a deep, inventive collaboration, blending analog and digital, melody and production, in unique and novel ways.

Since his paralysis left him, somewhat paradoxically, with more freedom of movement, Luna happily obliged. And while at the Burning Man event his hand had finally recovered to the point where he was able to pick up the bass once again.

It was in the context of philosophical strategy mixed with the ancient ruins and amphitheatres of the Greeks, Mycenaeans, and others, that he rediscovered his muse, writing a “boatload” of new songs, and producing a rough EP of the material, using nothing more than GarageBand and his MacBook Air’s laptop mic.

<p>I am excited to announce that this project has reached its goal 40 days ahead of schedule! That means the drum production can move forward as scheduled and a very special drum will be donated to the Ability Garden program at the Wilmington, NC arboretum. <br/></p>
<p>But why should we stop there? <br/></p>
<p>This project has the potential to reach 200% funding and I've been tipped off to a program here in Asheville called the Dragonfly Forest. These cats do some really cool things like hosting summer camp and after school programs for special needs children FREE OF CHARGE!. Yeah, that's awesome. And they have a rockin music program, so it sounds like we should kick them a drum right?   <br/></p>

<p><b>The story</b><br/><span class=""notranlsate""><span></span></span></p>
<p><span class=""notranlsate""><span>As many of you know I have a passion to build things, and over the past six years I have been building and designing drums made from recycled propane tanks.These drums have come a long way from the first one I built nearly six years ago...</span></span><br/><span class=""notranlsate""><span></span></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/113133/files/20131004120108-first_drums.jpg?1380913268"" src="""" style=""width: 332.331px; height: 249px;""/></p></span></span><p><span class=""notranlsate""><span>Since my move to Asheville, North Carolina I have been contacting local machine shops in order to create a small production of drums which are precision cut to my design. After months of visiting machine shops and gathering estimates for their services I have found a shop that is up to the challenge and has supplied me with my first Laser-cut Flow Drum prototypes...</span></span><br/><span class=""notranlsate""><span></span></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/113135/files/20131004120226-Lasercut_double_in_Dminor-Cegyptian_for_DR_Z.jpg?1380913346"" src="""" style=""width: 311.387px; height: 415px;""/></p>
<span class=""notranlsate""><span>Each Flow drum is made of 211 steel from recycled propane tanks, lap-sized, cut with laser precision for optimal tone, and tunable over the years by the use of high powered magnets installed. Each drum can be tuned to the pentatonic scale of your choice.<br/><br/>The funds raised from this campaign will contribute to the cost of having these drums Laser cut, and will provide the consumables necessary (Blades, sandpaper etc) to make this production a success.<br/><p><br/><strong><em></em></strong></p>

<p></p></span><b>Previous works</b><br/><br/><p>In the spring of 2012, after seeing some of my drums, The Arboretum at Wilmington, NC commissioned me to create an musical art installation to be featured in their new butterfly garden. After much thought, I designed a sculpture of a butterfly made entirely out of propane tanks incorporating Flow drums into the piece...</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/113182/files/20131004122053-butterfly_for_arboretum.jpg?1380914453"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The arboretum hosts a program called the <a href=""http://www.nhcgov.com/Arboretum/Pages/AbilityGarden.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ability Garden</a> which teaches horticultural therapy for group homes, nursing homes, and people with special needs. While this piece was being installed one of the Ability groups full of children walked by and couldn't resist playing the butterfly drums. There's no greater feeling to me than seeing an art piece fully enjoyed.  <br/></p>
<p>If this project reaches full funding, I will personally donate a Flow Drum to the Ability Garden for all to enjoy.<br/></p>

That means the drum production can move forward as scheduled and a very special drum will be donated to the Ability Garden program at the Wilmington, NC arboretum. 
But why should we stop there? 
This project has the potential to reach 200% funding and I've been tipped off to a program here in Asheville called the Dragonfly Forest. These cats do some really cool things like hosting summer camp and after school programs for special needs children FREE OF CHARGE!. Yeah, that's awesome. And they have a rockin music program, so it sounds like we should kick them a drum right?   
check out their website Dragonfly Forest
The story
As many of you know I have a passion to build things, and over the past six years I have been building and designing drums made from recycled propane tanks.These drums have come a long way from the first one I built nearly six years ago...
Since my move to Asheville, North Carolina I have been contacting local machine shops in order to create a small production of drums which are precision cut to my design. After months of visiting machine shops and gathering estimates for their services I have found a shop that is up to the challenge and has supplied me with my first Laser-cut Flow Drum prototypes...

Each Flow drum is made of 211 steel from recycled propane tanks, lap-sized, cut with laser precision for optimal tone, and tunable over the years by the use of high powered magnets installed. Each drum can be tuned to the pentatonic scale of your choice.The funds raised from this campaign will contribute to the cost of having these drums Laser cut, and will provide the consumables necessary (Blades, sandpaper etc) to make this production a success.
The Way It Works:
Indiegogo is a free online platform where anyone can raise money for 
important causes or projects that they are passionate about.  If I reach
 my goal then Indiegogo keeps 4% of my earnings and if I don’t reach my 
goal Indiegogo keeps 9% of my earnings.  All of my earnings will go 
towards funding of this drum production.
The Perks are the detail, which I am most excited about!  When you contribute toward my project you can receive one of the drums from this production, Discounts towards a future purchase of your drum or other percussive goodies available on my Etsy shop Flow Drum Percussion, or even have your drum painted by one of our featured artists on this campaign!
Artists include:
Annie Bennet -   Spectrum Geometry


Casey Dupree - Greyscale art


Zack Weaver -  Art Slab

Rob Fogle  -  Art Slab
Once the laser cutting process is complete you will be contacted personally and offered a variety of scales to choose from. Each scale contains 8 notes and cover one and a half octaves of a pentatonic scale.Currently these are the scales I can offerThere are over 60 scales listed here so if you need help in determining which scale would suit you best feel free to contact mePlease note that all scales are tuned to A 440 Hz which is standard tuning for modern music. Each scale can also be tuned to Pythagorean tuning which is A 432 Hz. This tuning is thought to resonate with the human body better but does not play well with most instruments today due to the standardization of tuning to A 440 Hz.The Major PentatonicsD Major      D E F# A B D E F#C# Major    C# D# F G# A# C# D# FC Major      C D E G A C D EB Major      B C# D# F# G# B C# D#A# Major    A# C D F G A# C DA major     A B C# E F# A B C#G# Major    G# A# C D# F G# A# CG Major      G A B D E G A BF# Major     F# G# A# C# D# F# G# A#The Minor PentatonicsD Minor       D F G A C D F GC# Minor     C# E F# G# B C# E F#C Minor       C D# F G A# C D# FB Minor       B D E F# A B D EA# Minor      A# C# D# F G# A# C# D#A Minor        A C D E G A C DG# Minor     G# B C# D# F# G# B C#G Minor       G A# C D F G A# CF# Minor      F# A B C# E F# A BThe Hijaz (Phygrian) PentatonicsD Hijaz        D F G A# C D F GC# Hijaz      C# E F# A B C# E FC Hijaz        C D# F G# A# C D# FB Hijaz        B D E G A B D EA# Hijaz      A# C# D# F# G# A# C# D#A Hijaz        A C D F G A C DG# Hijaz     G# B C# E F# G# B C#G Hijaz       G A# C D# F G A# CF# Hijaz      F# A B D E F# A BIntegral Scales    (These are Hexatonic or six note scales)D Integral     D E F A A# C D EC# Integral   C# D# E G# A B C# D#C Integral      C D D# G G# A# C DB Integral      B C# D F# G A B C#A# Integral    A# C C# F F# G# A# CA Integral      A B C E F G A BG# Integral    G# A# B D# E F# G# A#G Integral      G A A# D D# F G AF# Integral     F# G# A C# D E F# G#Egyptian Scales D  Egyptian    D E G A B D E G AC# Egyptian   C# D# F# G# A# C# D# F#C Egyptian     C D F G A C D FB Egyptian     B C# E F# G# B C# EA# Egyptian   A# C D# F G A# C D#A Egyptian     A B D E F# A B DG# Egyptian   G# A# C# D# F G# A# C#G Egyptian     G A C D E G A CAkebono Scales    (A Japanese Pentatonic Variation)D Akebono    D E F A A# D D E FC# Akebono  C# D# E G# A C# D# EC Akebono     C D D# G G# C D D#B Akebono     B C# D F# G B C# DA# Akebono   A# C C# F F# A# C C#A Akebono     A B C E F A B CG# Akebono   G# A# B D# E G# A# BG Akebono     G A A# D D# G A A#F# Akebono    F# G# A C# D F# G# APygmy ScalesD Pygmy    D E F A C D E FC# Pygmy  C# D# E G# B C# D# EC Pygmy    C D D# G A# C D D#B Pygmy     B C# D F# A B C# DA# Pygmy   A# C C# F G# A# C C#A Pygmy     A B C E G A B CG# Pygmy  G# A# B D# F# G# A# BG Pygmy     G A A# D F G A A#F# Pygmy    F# G# A C# E F# G# A
 Be sure to add the Shipping Fee if you cannot redeem your drum personally from me in Asheville or Wilmington NC.
Here's a preview of our awesome T-shirts. (actual color of the shirt may vary, This preview is intended to display our logo)


Previous worksIn the spring of 2012, after seeing some of my drums, The Arboretum at Wilmington, NC commissioned me to create an musical art installation to be featured in their new butterfly garden. After much thought, I designed a sculpture of a butterfly made entirely out of propane tanks incorporating Flow drums into the piece...

The arboretum hosts a program called the Ability Garden which teaches horticultural therapy for group homes, nursing homes, and people with special needs. While this piece was being installed one of the Ability groups full of children walked by and couldn't resist playing the butterfly drums. There's no greater feeling to me than seeing an art piece fully enjoyed.  
If this project reaches full funding, I will personally donate a Flow Drum to the Ability Garden for all to enjoy.

<p> </p>
<p>Art Aguilera, un joven mexicano-americano nacido en California es salmista, compositor, productor y poseedor de un instrumento vocal privilegiado, que brinda a la escena de la música cristiana un nuevo horizonte.</p>
<p>Art es parte del nuevo mover de esta generación que no se conforma con el status quo, sino que se camina hacia una nueva dirección, característica que le distingue en la creciente industria de la música.

<p>Su primer álbum ""Te Entrego Mi Vida"" le abrió las puertas a la industria de la música cristiana y ha impactado las vidas de aquellos que lo han escuchado. Art ha expandido sus horizontes desde entonces y esto se ve reflejado en su nuevo álbum titulado ""Asombroso Dios"". Las canciones de este nuevo álbum demuestran mayor conocimiento de diferentes técnicas, un aumento en la creatividad, y lo que es más importante, una mayor revelación de quién es Dios.</p>
<p>En este tiempo Dios lo ha levantado con un manto profético para traer el Espíritu de avivamiento a una nueva generación de adoradores, y para trabajar en la unidad que provocará la manifestación de la Gloria de Dios en las naciones.

<h3>ABOUT DAYS N' DAZE</h3>
""The band's sound has been described as ""crust punk"", ""crack rock folk"", ""folk punk"", ""riot folk"",..and does have an edge that many folk punk acts suppress. Song themes run the gamut from social (gang violence, consumerism/terrorism, annihilation of the environment for corporate pocket-lining, the mundane and unavoidable anxieties of modern life, et al) to recreational (how the fuck did we end up in jail?).<br/><br/>What DnD is best known for is its live shows, which are energetic to the point of audience members stripping their clothes off in ecstatic, music-induced jubilation (or, too much PBR). Its played a variety of venues, from Houston's Walter's, Warehouse Live, Fitzgerald's, Mango's, Dan Electro's and others, to house shows at stalwarts like Ghetto Blaster, Ponderosa and House of Creeps. Out of town, its played two years on Brootal Sun Fest, at Skatopia's Bowl Bash and in Tompkins Square Park in NYC's Alphabet City. The band was honored to open the second day of performances at the 2011 Houston Free Press Summerfest, which featured headliner Weezer later that night. <br/><br/>Like any band of this millenia, DnD has employed the Internet to reach a broader audience. As of this writing, it has a following of over 2,100 on its Facebook page. A lot from Texas, Louisiana and the southwest, but also many on the west coast and the north east and west. On Reverbnation, the band's songs have been played more than 14,000 times as of this date. DnD lists over 3,400 fans on Reverb, many in the male 25-34 demographic, including abroad in places like Canada, Japan, the Ukraine, Kuala Lampur, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom.""

<li>Most importantly a van! Our last tour we had to forfeit all of our merch money we had been saving to rent a vehicle , that meant we had no shirts, stickers, or patches to sell while we we're out on the road (it sucked!)<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>A New CD!! We are releasing our sixth full length album intitled ""Rogue Taxidermy"" We will still be recording all of our music ourselves but need help getting prepared for our upcoming East Coast tour this fall. <br/><br/>

I release what I like -- as a lifetime blues and jazz fan -- and what I think others will also like. But, as the corny old joke goes, ""this business is non-profit, it's not supposed to be, but it is.""  I'm running things on a frayed shoe string and the economics of the music business provides a desolate environment. So, for this special project, I'm asking for help.<br/>As far as my label goes, the words ""Random Chance"" comes into play because I started this label by accident. In the late 1990s I wrote a biography of blues mandolin player, James ""Yank"" Rachell (published in 2001 by University Press of Mississippi). In the course of interviewing Yank and some of his blues collaborators (including Honeyboy Edwards, Charlie Musslewhite, Ry Cooder, Howard Armstrong and Bob Koester) I thought about some of the old out-of-print LPs of Yank I tracked down doing the discography for the book. <br/>I looked up who owned the rights and ended up licensing a couple of LPs and inadvertently started a record label.<br/><br/>Martin Lang is a great blues harmonica player. He has that wailing and urgent Chicago blues sound I've always loved. I first heard him when Chicago bluesman Dave Myers produced an album for me, Harmonica Blues Orgy. Four of the 16 tracks of that compilation cd were by Martin Lang.<br/>Martin has been backing up Taildragger in his band for many years and has played and recorded with other notable bluesmakers.<br/>The proposed album I'm trying to fund will, along with Martin, include vocalists Taildragger and Willie Buck; guitarists Rusty Zinn and Billy Flynn; bassist Jimmy Upstairs; and drummer Steve Cushing.<br/><br/>Three thousand dollars is not a lot of money to record, master, pay for studio time, with mixing and mastering, pay musicians, press cds and digitally release an album to web portals.We all know we are doing a low-budget project and my label will also have to put in funds above the $3,000 goal. If we can exceed the goal then we can put some of it into more pay for musicians and/or more sales promotion. All of the production will be done in Chicago.<br/><br/>Your donation can help make this happen. The harp-centered Chicago blues band sound must be nurtured and perpetuated. The great lineup that will be on this album are certain to produce some seriously righteous blues.<br/><br/>We can't offer paid vacations to Tahiti as a dividend for your contribution, but you will certainly get a free copy of the CD.<br/><br/>If you are financially tight, and aren't we all? -- you can help get the word out through email, facebook, your web site or whatever else you can think of.<br/><br/>You can also use the Indigogo share tools to send out information about this project.<br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br/></div>","I started Random Chance Records (www.randomchancerecords.com) 15 years ago as a venue for real blues and jazz .

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<div>The LADY GOT CHOPS WOMEN'S MONTH JAZZ FESTIVAL (aka Music and Arts Festival) was conceived in 2003 by mother and daughter new cafe owners Lillithe Meyers Tiecha Merritt and bassist /fledgeling web designer Kim Clarke. The fest original two fold purpose- to draw customers and celebrate women  in jazz.</div>
<div>Although the cafe, The Jazz Spot, was a lovely venue its locale was in a challenging locale in a two-fare zone.The address itself was erroneous as the entrance was around the corner from the legal address.</div>
<div>The cafe closed in 2009 .<a href=""http://theglobaljazznetwork.ning.com/video/1982065:Video:14027"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://theglobaljazznetwork.ning.com/video/1982065:Video:14027</a>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div> Kim designed their website,promoted and booked 99% of the women musicians many of whom she had worked with in Kit McClure Big Band.</div>
<div>Without  a home base  in 2010 ,Kim applied for a Chase grant  and a few other grants.Friends came her assistance with booking opportunites in several locations and the festival continued under the Music and Arts name. </div>
<div>The 8th festival had 25 performances in 15 venues around NY and included musicians from other idioms and 1 dance troupe.Festival T-shirts were auctioned to raise money for Doctors Without Borders as were banners and large posters.</div>

Each event has been surprisingly successful in making new friends or just good music for the moment.We hope to extend the festival to reflect the beauty of art as is celebrated in so many professional festivals around the world.</span></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We have lost many of the giants of jazz.Some of us have known and been in their presence as women performers.Few of the women instrumentalists names have survived the test of time.I have been told of a woman bassist who played with Charlie Parker -no name was given.There are many lessons which can be garnered for young women today studying and understanding the struggles and achievements of those in times past. Before their story is completely forgotten we would also like to capture bright moments on film of those who are performing locally on a global scale .</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>My ultimate vision for the festival is to 1 rent a large easily accessed Manhattan venue for 2 days .</div>
<div>2 hire a crew  for security, box office,lighting and sound crew with equipment</div>

</div></div>","Our Story
The LADY GOT CHOPS WOMEN'S MONTH JAZZ FESTIVAL (aka Music and Arts Festival) was conceived in 2003 by mother and daughter new cafe owners Lillithe Meyers Tiecha Merritt and bassist /fledgeling web designer Kim Clarke. The fest original two fold purpose- to draw customers and celebrate women  in jazz.
Although the cafe, The Jazz Spot, was a lovely venue its locale was in a challenging locale in a two-fare zone.The address itself was erroneous as the entrance was around the corner from the legal address.
The cafe closed in 2009 .http://theglobaljazznetwork.ning.com/video/1982065:Video:14027


 Kim designed their website,promoted and booked 99% of the women musicians many of whom she had worked with in Kit McClure Big Band.
Without  a home base  in 2010 ,Kim applied for a Chase grant  and a few other grants.Friends came her assistance with booking opportunites in several locations and the festival continued under the Music and Arts name. 
The 8th festival had 25 performances in 15 venues around NY and included musicians from other idioms and 1 dance troupe.Festival T-shirts were auctioned to raise money for Doctors Without Borders as were banners and large posters.

Information on all prior fests can be found 

http://thejazz.8m.com/fest.html The festival archive.
CURRENT CALENDAR http://kimclarke.8m.com/ladyfest9.html


This festival is designed to give women musicians ,writers,band leaders and composers the light that is lost namely THEIR NAMES .It was also designed for women to give other women work-mentor to girls considering musical performance and spread the history of women who preceeded them ..In a time when art, cultural achievements
 as well as the struggle of humanity is slated to be erased from the history books its the least we can do in the digital age- to acknowledge and honor each other .It is extremely difficult for women to feel confident outside of their comfort zone. It has been the history of the LGCWMJF
to break this chain by combining folk who may or may not have ever worked with each other due to social barriers in even an ethnically as diverse a locale as NY. Each event has been surprisingly successful in making new friends or just good music for the moment.We hope to extend the festival to reflect the beauty of art as is celebrated in so many professional festivals around the world.

The Impact
We have lost many of the giants of jazz.Some of us have known and been in their presence as women performers.Few of the women instrumentalists names have survived the test of time.I have been told of a woman bassist who played with Charlie Parker -no name was given.There are many lessons which can be garnered for young women today studying and understanding the struggles and achievements of those in times past. Before their story is completely forgotten we would also like to capture bright moments on film of those who are performing locally on a global scale .


What We Need & What You Get
My ultimate vision for the festival is to 1 rent a large easily accessed Manhattan venue for 2 days .
2 hire a crew  for security, box office,lighting and sound crew with equipment
hardcopy press- flyers banners-posters-
handbill with bios,tickets- 
3hire some of the more well known women in jazz at the fee that they command
and introduce them to the up and coming ladies who will also be paid for performance.

My immediate vision is to be able to
1 pay musicians whose bands are working off the door- (paying the band out of the funds collected or supplementing them with their own income) 40 musicians (10 bands with 4 members)x $100=$4000
 2 hire videographers to attend and film 3 minutes of each festival date 25 dates x $50=1250
to hire a person to handle the DOOR ,Tickets, and /orsale of artist merchandise  25dates x$30= 750
3 I would also like to have some ""patch fund"" money to give to the club owners who have assisted in the festival and may not have outstanding turnouts.

(Last year i received a grant of $300. from the Jazz Foundation for the making of flyers,posters banners etc.
We auctioned the posters and festival t-shirt and artist donated items and raised $1428 for Doctors Without Borders Haiti crisis.)

I have an amazing group of musicians currently playing with me, and we have put together a new cd, “Little Flowers”! We are so excited about this project! After a 2 month tour of writing and playing new music, we’ve gotten into the studio and have recorded a new project that we are all in love with! This music is really our hearts, and we want to share it with the world!<br/>
I heard the final mixes last night, and I’m <span class=""caps"">SOOO</span> <span class=""caps"">EXCITED</span>!!<br/>
   After an bit of a fundraiser flop, I’ve personally used up all of my savings and band money for the studio (though we still owe $800), and now need money for mastering ($1000) and for printing ($2000). We’d love to partner with our friends, family, and fans to make this record possible and get it out into the world!<br/>
  For only $8 you can essentially pre-order the record, and we’ll mail it out the second we get it in, even if that’s before the cd release show.<br/>
We have a lot of other great rewards, including one-of-a-kind art and jewelry from members of the band, a hand decorated mix cd from me, free admission to shows, a harp lesson, and much more!</p>

<p><em> </em>We have a dream, an <em>English Dream</em>!</p>
<p>What do you get when an Englishman with a New York band makes a record about England in New York? A whole new genre!</p>
<p><em>English Dream </em>will be the 6<sup>th</sup> record of Spottiswoode &amp; His Enemies’ 15-year career. So far we’ve made a rock record, a gospel record, a Euro-cabaret record, an Americana record and most recently, <em>Wild Goosechase Expedition, </em>a record that was so hard to categorize that it won the Vox Populi Independent Music Award for Best Eclectic Release of 2011.</p>
<p><em>English Dream</em> will be a new form of music entirely: ANGLICANA!</p>
<p>Yes, you’ve heard it here first. Like Americana, Anglicana is an organic form that combines doses of folk and electric music. However, unlike Americana, Anglicana’s themes are English! English songs performed by an American band. It also helps that Spottiswoode’s father became an Anglican minister when his youngest child was a teenager. (No, it’s not a religious record!) Some of the 14 songs on <em>English Dream</em> evoke the haunting English countryside. Others touch on Spottiswoode’s childhood in London. All reflect the bandleader’s distinct lyrical and storytelling style.</p>
<p>Add to that the unique musicianship of a critically acclaimed and award-winning New York septet! We really think this will be our most beautiful recording yet.</p>
<p>It’s being produced once again by our own Riley McMahon. We recently laid down the basic tracks at the Bunker Studio in Brooklyn. We plan to finish it off at Riley’s New Warsaw Studio in East Williamsburg where we will add the vital element of our horn and backing vocal section: Candace DeBartolo and Kevin Cordt!</p>
<p>Once overdubs are completed we shall mix and master the record, complete artwork and duplicate one thousand CDs. All of this takes money! Studio, engineering, production and post-production costs will reach close to $16,000.</p>
<p>However, the record doesn’t stop there. A major frustration we have faced in the past is that, despite fantastic reviews for all our recordings, we haven’t been able to get the word out. It’s vital that we have money left over this time to orchestrate a real publicity campaign, something that can truly spread the word and allow the band to keep going. So an extra $10,000 to cover the cost of press, blog and radio promotion would make a HUGE difference. We also hope to make at least one music video, a vital on-line tool these days.</p>
<p>In the past, that was the role of “the music industry.” But these days more and more artists are depending on their audience. We have been extremely fortunate with former projects to have received the backing of friends and fans from all corners of the globe. If you have given before, we hope you’re glad you did! Please consider supporting us again. Thanks to you we have won awards and plaudits from all over the world! If you’ve only recently discovered us please come on board!</p>
<p>There are a slew of rewards to choose from: pre-sales, album credits, bonus tracks, house concerts, artwork, commissioned songs etc. We hope there’s one that appeals to you.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or want to hear some of the nearly-completed tracks please contact us directly at <a href=""mailto:spode@spottiswoode.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">spode@spottiswoode.com</a></p>

Your donation will be helping both us and plenty of small business owners, aspiring bands, musicians and artists get their hard work noticed and appreciated by the public and a thriving region to continue it's cultural growth.
Your donated funds will allow us to continue publishing a free Velvet Rope magazine, and maximize our potential to expand our pages, and our distribution.

--------------------------

It would be much appreciated if you could spread the word of our campaign with everyone any way you can. Facebook, Twitter, Indiegogo Share Tools, or good old fashioned word of mouth.

<h2>A CREBER CHRISTMAS ALBUM</h2>
<h2>Holiday classics by a versatile musical family</h2>
<h3> </h3>
<p>If you know us (Michelle, Monique and Michael) at all, chances are you know that we really, REALLY love Christmas. We love everything about it: snow, evergreen trees, decorations, big family dinners, the celebration of light in the darkness of winter, the spirit of love and generosity...and, of course, the music. All three of us are professional entertainers with busy careers as actor, singer and dancer (Michelle), vocalist, teacher and producer (Monique), and composer, producer and pianist (Michael) - but when the idea of recording a family Christmas album came up recently, we were immediately ready to drop everything to make it happen.<br/><br/> Okay, maybe not ready to drop EVERYTHING. But definitely ready to put ""produce new CD in time for Christmas"" at the top of the family To Do list!<br/><br/> We wondered, though: would anyone besides us so much as notice yet another holiday-themed album, even a beautifully-produced one featuring A-list musicians and fantastic pop/jazz repertoire? Michelle, who has a large and enthusiastic fan following on social media, put the question out on Facebook and Twitter: if my parents and I were to release a Christmas CD...would anyone be interested? The response was an immediate and resounding YES!!<br/><br/> So be it! We have already actively started work on it but the main challenge is coming up with the funds while we are still in the process of recouping expenses from Michelle’s debut CD. (Producing high quality recordings is very costly to do as indie artists without record label support.) That's where YOU come in. We need to raise the necessary funds with CD presales by early November.</p>

<p>Why should you invest in our project?</p>
<p>1. The music! If you are familiar with Michelle's debut album, you know that when she covers a song, she does something amazing and different with it. Imagine what she could do with all the great Christmas repertoire out there! If you've seen any shows from Monique &amp; Michael’s Magic of Christmas concert series or heard their compilation CD, you will know that their extensive experience with Christmas repertoire and recordings is going to shine through on this project. The trio are also thrilled to be having Andrew Stein, a super talented singer/musician/arranger, working on the project as well. Plus, more special guests and contributors will be announced!</p>
<p>2. We know what we're doing. Monique is an experienced producer whose most recent project was Michelle’s debut CD. Monique is also a session singer who has done featured vocals for film, TV, animation, jingles and many recording projects. Michael has produced albums for countless clients and has recorded &amp; performed with the likes of k.d.lang, David Foster, Martin Short and Raffi. Michael won a Juno Award and was nominated for a Grammy for his work with Raffi on “Bananaphone”, a song he co-wrote). Michelle has also contributed her singing and acting skills to numerous high-profile film &amp; tv projects such as ""My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic"", ""Smart Cookies"" and ""The Search for Santa Paws"".</p>

<p>3. We work with top notch musicians, engineers, designers and recording studios, and are committed to a final product that has excellent production values. Your pledge will go towards every step of this process, from recording &amp; mastering to artwork &amp; manufacturing, and all the magic in between.</p>
<p>4. Support an important cause. As with Michelle’s Timeless album, a portion of the proceeds will be donated to PLAN International's ""<a href=""http://becauseiamagirl.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Because I Am A Girl</a>"" campaign, which addresses the issue of gender inequality in developing countries and promotes women's rights.

<p>We're really excited about making this a collective community project, full of the best kind of Christmas spirit and involving as many of YOU as possible; our fans, friends and family from near and far.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>A sentence of life without the possibility of parole (LWOP) is a death sentence.  Worse, it is a long, slow, dissipating death sentence without any of the legal or administrative safeguards rightly awarded to those condemned to traditional forms of execution.  It exposes and caters to that segment of our society that believes redemption and personal transformation are not possible for all human beings, and that it is reasonable and just to forever define an individual by his or her worst act.  LWOP is wrong and should be abolished.</p>
<p>The Other Death Penalty Project (TODPP) is a true grassroots organizing campaign comprised wholly of men and women sentenced to life without the possibility of parole, the purpose of which is to end this practice of sentencing tens of thousands to a slow and painful execution in this nation’s maximum-security prisons through a peaceful, well-orchestrated and thought-out plan to change hearts and minds. TODPP’s ultimate goal is to see the permanent end to the use of this form of state-sanctioned execution (along with all other forms), resulting in all life term prisoners having, at least, the possibility of earning parole. </p>
<p>A generous grant from the Peace Development Fund has paid for the production costs of TODPP’s forthcoming book, “Too Cruel, Not Unusual Enough,” a unique and extraordinary anthology of writings by LWOP prisoners and others.  Funds raised through this campaign will allow us to print copies of this remarkable book to be placed on the desks of at least 1,000 death penalty abolitionist groups (who support LWOP as a “reasonable alternative” to lethal injection), policymakers, thought leaders, and others of influence nationwide.  Monies raised will also be used to place targeted ads to raise awareness of our cause and raise even more funds for project related activities through increased book sales and donations.</p>
<p>Your contribution is vital in helping to create a more just, humane, and compassionate society through the abolition of all forms of the death penalty, including LWOP.</p>

</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>We need $10,000 to pay for printing, postage, and mailing costs for 1,000 books, as well as for targeted advertisements and book contest entry fees.  It costs $4 to print each book ($4,000), an average of $3 per book in postage ($3,000), and approximately $800 in office supply costs (mailing envelopes, paper, tape, etc.).  The remaining $2,200 will be used to place targeted ads in print and other media and enter “Too Cruel, Not Unusual Enough” in writing contests which will garner additional publicity for our cause. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Every human being has inherent worth and value, including those who owe a debt to society.  As well, every human being possesses the capacity for transformation and redemption.  By contributing to our campaign, you are helping to spread awareness of these profound truths, while creating a system of justice based on healing and restoration rather than retribution and revenge.</p>
<p>TODPP is a project of The Steering Committee for the Honor Program, which was founded in 2001 by Kenneth E. Hartman, a prisoner serving LWOP at California State Prison-Los Angeles County (CSP-LAC).  Ken wrote the original proposal that helped to start the Honor Program (please see <a href=""http://www.prisonhonorprogram.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.prisonhonorprogram.org</a>), and went on in late 2008 to found TODPP, serving since as its Executive Director.  The purpose of The Steering Committee is to provide a platform for motivated prisoners, most of whom are serving LWOP sentences, to actively shape the agenda of the prison system to one in which rehabilitation is possible.  The Steering Committee has had enormous success in this regard.  Working with California Senate Majority Leader Gloria Romero, The Steering Committee was the catalyst for her 2007 prison reform legislation, SB 299, which sought to expand Honor Programs to all Level III and Level IV prisons throughout the state.  In 2008, nominated by Senator Romero for its remarkable work in prison reform, The Steering Committee was selected as one of twelve prize-winning finalists (out of over 250 applications) in the James Irvine Foundation Leadership Awards. </p>
<p>When we launched The Other Death Penalty Project, there was virtually no awareness or discussion of LWOP as a death sentence.  The recent Supreme Court rulings limiting the use of life without parole sentences for juveniles; California Senator Leland Yee’s bill, SB9, recently signed into law by Governor Brown, now permits prisoners serving LWOP for crimes committed as juveniles to appeal their sentences; and Proposition 34, on the ballot last November, which sought to abolish execution by lethal injection and replace it with LWOP (death by incarceration), have all served to heighten the level of visibility about the true meaning, cruelty, and inhumanity of life without parole sentences.  </p>
<p>TODPP has been at the forefront of these developments since our inception, and especially in the past year.  The highlight of 2012 was when Ken Hartman addressed the July meeting of the California Democratic Party’s Progressive Caucus.  Ken, who spoke by phone from prison, participated in “Dead Men Walking,” a panel discussion arranged by Christine Thomas of The Campaign to End the Death Penalty (one of the few death penalty abolitionist groups that publicly opposes life without parole sentences as a “reasonable” alternative to lethal injection).  Ken’s comments on LWOP as the other death penalty opened the eyes of many at the meeting who automatically assumed prisoners on death row would be happy to receive LWOP, rather than the truth that they are merely being given a different death sentence.  (You can hear Ken’s presentation at the “Dead Men Walking” panel discussion here:  <a href=""http://dir.groups.yahoo.com/group/JudgedMenAllianceForTomorrow/message/17748"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://dir.groups.yahoo.com/group/JudgedMenAllianceForTomorrow/message/17748</a>.)</p>
<p>TODPP's work has also been embraced by the academic criminal justice community.  We are quoted in the new book, “Life Without Parole: America’s New Death Penalty,” edited by Charles Ogletree Jr., Jesse Climenko Professor of Law at Harvard Law School and Austin Sarat, William Nelson Cromwell Professor of Law at Amherst College. Professor Sarat wrote a short positive commentary for “Too Cruel, Not Unusual Enough,"" as did Professor Michelle Alexander (author of “The New Jim Crow”) and Dr. Robert Johnson, Professor of Justice, Law, and Society at American University.   </p>

A short rhythmic musical phrase that the Spanish speaking kitchen staff seemed to appreciate, they started laughing and singing the phrase back to me. The song was born!

<p> </p></div>","After performing to sold-out audiences throughout New York City, we're ready to present our first annual Opera Hispánica Festival in March of 2013! 
 
As the nation's first and only Spanish-language and Hispanic opera company, Opera Hispánica offers audiences a unique and relevant form of cultural entertainment at a time when many traditional opera companies throughout the country are closing their doors. Now more than ever is it important to support innovative organizations like Opera Hispánica that are changing the performing arts. 
 
As part of this year's festival, OH will be presenting two performances of María de Buenos Aires, a tango-opera by Astor Piazzolla at the acclaimed Le Poisson Rouge in Manhattan's west village. This production will be streamed LIVE from New York City. Help bring our production of Maria de Buenos Aires to life by supporting our IndieGoGo Campaign!
 


 
PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
 
María de Buenos Aires
A tango-opera by Astor Piazzolla
(le) poisson rouge

March 15 & 17 at 7:30pm

 
Conducted by Jorge Parodi
Directed by Beth Greenberg
Solange Merdinian as Maria
Marcelo Guzzo as El Payador
Juan Pablo Jofre, Bandoneon
 
You'll lose all sense of boundaries as you experience María de Buenos Aires, the famous tango-opera by Astor Piazzolla. Who is this woman of the night that wanders the streets without fear or reason? Is she a mother, a child, or a ghost? Saint or whore? She is María, the most common name, and the name of the Most Exalted. She will not be confined by categorizations, she absorbs all assumptions. Join Opera Hispánica as it turns (le) poisson rouge into sultry Buenos Aires for 3 nights of tango, seduction and mystery!
 
OUR GOAL THROUGH THIS CAMPAIGN:
 



Opera Hispánica is trying to raise $15,000 for our production of María de Buenos Aires. 
 
Your tax-deductible gift will help make this production possible and go directly towards production costs such as: artist fees, costumes, scenery, and administrative costs. OH is a tax-exempt non-profit organization which means that when you donate to OH through our IndieGoGo campaign, your gift is tax-deductible. 
 

THE IMPACT & HOW  YOU PLAY A VALUABLE PART:

 
A pioneering non-profit organization in every sense of the word, Opera Hispánica was created to serve as a platform to promote operas inspired by the Latino and Hispanic cultures. 
 
Our new production of María de Buenos Aires gives OH the opportunity to engage new opera audiences by promoting a musical genre, that is rarely explored and often neglected by traditional opera companies. Join us by becoming a contributor to an opera company that is truly different! Every donation in every denomination is appreciated and valued to the growth of our organization and our Festival.  Can't be in NYC for the production? No worries! We will stream the production live from (le) poisson rouge. Be a part of this amazing production no matter where you live. 

 
The BEST support comes through your word:
Help us spread the word!  YOUR support helps Opera Hispánica!

<h3>We're shooting a sci-fi music video!</h3>
<p>Hi, we're Modern Vintage, a Los Angeles classic rock-inspired band.  Our upcoming album is a science-fiction concept about a washed-up musician and an earth-bound alien learning about friendship and power of music.  In the first single, Friend's Ship, we find Wood and Zado, the protagonists of the album, transporting from location to location as they establish trust between each other. </p>
<p>In this music video, we decided to depict this journey of developing friendship through the imaginative eyes of children playing the 'close-to-home' game of hide and seek.  The video begins in the boy's room, and as he plays with his toys he teleports to a far-away site where he meets his new alien friend Zado.  The two kids begin the game of hide and seek, their realities coming together as they teleport across LA. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>We need a little help.</h3>
<p>We're not asking for much; just $800 to cover the cost of the camera, lights, and equipment rentals, costumes, masks, props, gas, and food.</p>
<h3>As a token of our gratitude... </h3>
<p>We have rewards, all right - everything from special thanks, t-shirts, digital download of the song, admission to upcoming live shows, even your name as producer !</p>

<p><strong>NOTE: All perks (other than the digital album download) are COMPLETELY EXCLUSIVE to this campaign. They will be available only to people who donate, and will never be available again once the campaign ends.</strong></p>
<h3><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i39.tinypic.com/racd2b.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""The Story So Far""/></h3>
<p><strong>At the age of eighteen, I signed a record deal with Universal Republic and released my major label debut, </strong><em><strong>Picturesque.</strong> </em>I recorded a duet with Colbie Caillat. I toured the country, made more than a handful of friends that I treasure to this day, and had the amazing opportunity to work with a team of people who honestly believed in my music.<br/><br/><strong>Just a short six months later, it was all gone.</strong> My label dropped me, and I was discouraged. More than that, I had lost that artistic spark that fueled my songwriting. The whole experience left me nursing my wounds and feeling sorry for myself, <strong>but sometimes experiences like these can leave us stronger and more determined than ever if we can learn from them and use them to grow.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recently, I felt something that I thought might have been lost to me forever...</strong> That burning desire, a need to create again. The more I thought about it, the more insistent the idea became. I spent the past three years nursing my wounds, but I had also been growing as a person, as a musician, and as a songwriter.<strong> I've been waiting three years for this moment: I am finally ready to make an album again.</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i41.tinypic.com/2zs2phx.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Where You Come In""/></h3>
<p>There is no such thing as a DIY artist. When I first started making music, the support people showed me was incredible and I will never forget the impact that it made on me. <strong>Everything I have accomplished has been because of people who have poured out overwhelming support and love.</strong></p>

At the age of eighteen, I signed a record deal with Universal Republic and released my major label debut, Picturesque. I recorded a duet with Colbie Caillat. I toured the country, made more than a handful of friends that I treasure to this day, and had the amazing opportunity to work with a team of people who honestly believed in my music.Just a short six months later, it was all gone. My label dropped me, and I was discouraged. More than that, I had lost that artistic spark that fueled my songwriting. The whole experience left me nursing my wounds and feeling sorry for myself, but sometimes experiences like these can leave us stronger and more determined than ever if we can learn from them and use them to grow.
Recently, I felt something that I thought might have been lost to me forever... That burning desire, a need to create again. The more I thought about it, the more insistent the idea became. I spent the past three years nursing my wounds, but I had also been growing as a person, as a musician, and as a songwriter. I've been waiting three years for this moment: I am finally ready to make an album again.



There is no such thing as a DIY artist. When I first started making music, the support people showed me was incredible and I will never forget the impact that it made on me. Everything I have accomplished has been because of people who have poured out overwhelming support and love.
So when I began to plan who I would partner with to record and release this album, it was clear to me that the best choice was to collaborate with the people who have been beside me all along, investing in me and my music. I cannot tell you how much your belief in what I'm doing means to me, and the time has come for me to put my trust in you.
I need your help. I am going into the studio and will have to pay for studio time, a producer, mixer, and more. I am creating a 15-20 mini-documentary to be released along with the album, and I also hope to tour the US in support of this album.
The money will be used to directly fund the recording of the music, as well as to market and promote the album, and allow me to release the album independently. My only goal with this album is to share it with as many people as possible, and I can't do it on my own. I'm placing my faith in you, and I'm asking you to place yours in me.



I know some of you won't be able to make a contribution to my project, and that's perfectly okay!
No matter what, know that I appreciate every donation, every download, and every encouraging word that I have received throughout the years. It has been more support than I could have ever hoped for, and I can't thank you enough for everything you've done for me.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

This year we're looking to take it to the next level, launching a new improved App and 4 new radio streams! By adding new streams we'll essentially become the ""Pandora of Reggae"", you'll be able to flip around, change songs, and get all the best music in one place. And with the new App you'll have improved streaming quality (less drops & smoother buffering) and more advanced features including a renovated design tailored to iOS7 and new Android operation systems + social network connectivity with Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. And with your help we can keep out all corporate commercials. The 4 new streams include:  
REGGAE NATION - Playing the best of from Jamaica & international, with today's hits and classics from artists such as Bob Marley, Steel Pulse, Tarrus Riley, Alborosie, Chronixx, Buju Banton, Capleton, Burning Spear, Barrington Levy, Sizzla, Gyptian, Morgan Hertiage...
ISLAND MIX - Best from Hawaii, New Zealand & more such as Katchafire, The Green, Rebel Souljahz, J Boog, House of Shem, Anuhea, Maoli, Irie Love, Kimie, Kolohe Kai, Natural Vibrations, Sudden Rush, Spawnbreezie, HIRIE, The Steppas, Ooklah the Moc... 
ON THE RISE - Breaking new bands 24 hours a day! Up & comers like Arise Roots, Wheeland Brothers, Sono Vero, Ease Up, Tribal Theory, Reeform, Iya Terra, The Originalites, Natural Heights, The Hip Abduction, HI Roots, Rian Basilio & the Roosters, Special C, Aloha Radio, Mikey Reyes, Ikaika Beamer, Tatanka, Wakane, Kings & Comrads, Ezzrah, Coral Thief, Arden Park Roots, Just Chill...SURF ROOTS CLASSICS - The artists who paved the way including Sublime, Jack Johnson, 311, No Doubt, Pato Banton, Eek-A-Mouse, Half Pint, Don Carlos, Mishka, Fishbone, English Beat, The Samples, Reel Big Fish, OPM, Too Rude, Common Sense... 
And we still have the original Surf Roots station playing today's hottest reggae-rock artists including Slightly Stoopid, Rebelution, Iration, Pepper, the Marleys, Tribal Seeds, Dirty Heads & more..Surf Roots has been ranked the #1 Reggae station online for 3 years straight (according to iTunes Radio & Live 365) with thousands of listeners per day and millions of stream launches. So we know you love the music! But we've gotten feedback from you that the App cuts out too much, and not enough variety in the playlist. With this campaign we can change that. With your help we can continue having NO corporate commercials. The only breaks in the music are your favorite artists telling you when their new album drops, a tour you should check out, or a great festival coming up. When you turn on most stations you hear commercials constantly. When you come to Surf Roots you get strictly the music you love. Another difference with Pandora is that we are real reggae fans! This isn't some computer generated playlist. We support the artists, we sponsor festivals and tours, we are there at events hanging out with you at the booth, chillin with you daily on social media. Our radio staff works directly with the bands so we can debut new songs for you, do live chats, and give hot emerging bands their break.We are also paying publishing royalties for every song we play, so Surf Roots is making money for your favorite artists. It's important for us to always be giving back to this scene, and helping out these bands we all love. Paying royalties and not ripping off the music is crucial. 
LAUNCHING THE NEW SURF ROOTS 2014 APP The Surf Roots App V4 version will include: *Better connectivity with less drops & smoother buffering*A new and improved Player*Advanced social network connectivity with Instagram, Facebook, Twitter*A renovated design tailored to iOS7 and new Android operation systems

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>About Me  </strong></p>
<p>My name is Derina Harvey and I'm the lead singer for the Derina Harvey Band<strong> (</strong>dHb). I've been on stage since age 5 and began performing professionally at age 16. I've performed with many different groups and worked as a sound and lighting technician's assistant. I even have air play on CBC for a song I wrote back in 1999 called ""Rotten"".  </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Band</strong></p>
<p>Throughout my life I have been very fortunate to be surrounded by, and continue to surround myself with, experienced and accomplished musicians who just happen to be my very best friends. They are Steve Pinsent, Scott Greene and Ed Smith.</p>
<p>We have diplomas from the Music Industry and Performance Program and Recording Arts Program, both from the College of the North Atlantic, Newfoundland and Labrador, and a Bachelor of Music from Saint Francis Xavier University, Nova Scotia. We're all early-thirty-something and have over 110 years of combined experience on stage.  </p>
<p>We entertain people from all over the world. I am very humbled to hear them say that our music has ""brought them home"" and relieved their homesickness for even a short while. Entertaining is in our blood, passed down from our musical, comical, and artistic families. </p>
<p><strong>The Derina Harvey Band or dHb have been performing together for years and have been asked on countless occasions by a fantastic and growing group of fans<em> if we had an album to sell.</em>   </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Our Project</strong></p>
<p>This full length album is relevant and among the next generation of music that is honest and heartfelt. We are currently nearing the end of our recording project, a self titled album of the crowd's favourites. The covers we've chosen are Traditional, Celtic, and Eastern Canadian, however, we have branded them with our creative and energetic rock and roll flavour.</p>
<p>We've been doing this one by the book - professional gear, top engineers, mixing, mastering, photography, digital designers, mechanical rights, and registering. This album looks great and sounds even better! </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Our Campaign</strong></p>
<p>Which brings me to the funding. I'm a happily married mother of three producing a top quality product from my heart and my hands. My family will always come first and they've alway supported me.</p>
<p><strong> I've paid for everything thus far  - pre-production,  studio sessions,  musicians,  engineering,  and mixing - with performance revenue from approximately 150 solo shows &amp; 40 band shows each year.</strong></p>
<p>I'm very proud of this! This project has been a long time coming, as we began this ride back in 2012.  Now that I'm in the last leg of this amazing journey, <em>I am asking YOU to dance and sing across the finish line with me and my band of merry men!  </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How You Can Help?</strong></p>
<p>This Indiegogo campaign will give you the chance to hear a sample of the music, get your toes tapping, and pre-order the album. Check out the perks too!  </p>
<p>We have digital downloads, signed CDs that we'll mail out to you, high quality t-shirts for men and ladies, and opportunities for you to book me or dHb for your own private party where we'll entertain your friends with our wide range of crowd pleasing tunes.</p>
<p><strong>Your purchase or donation dollars will go directly to the mastering, duplication, and marketing of the Derina Harvey Band album.  </strong></p>
<p>So check out the video clip and have a listen to our version of EXCURSION AROUND THE BAY. Then donate, purchase a CD or t-shirt, or bring us to your garage for a party and be the talk of the town.    </p>

<h3> </h3></div>","Short Summary  
 
About Me  
My name is Derina Harvey and I'm the lead singer for the Derina Harvey Band (dHb). I've been on stage since age 5 and began performing professionally at age 16. I've performed with many different groups and worked as a sound and lighting technician's assistant. I even have air play on CBC for a song I wrote back in 1999 called ""Rotten"".  
 
The Band
Throughout my life I have been very fortunate to be surrounded by, and continue to surround myself with, experienced and accomplished musicians who just happen to be my very best friends. They are Steve Pinsent, Scott Greene and Ed Smith.
We have diplomas from the Music Industry and Performance Program and Recording Arts Program, both from the College of the North Atlantic, Newfoundland and Labrador, and a Bachelor of Music from Saint Francis Xavier University, Nova Scotia. We're all early-thirty-something and have over 110 years of combined experience on stage.  
We entertain people from all over the world. I am very humbled to hear them say that our music has ""brought them home"" and relieved their homesickness for even a short while. Entertaining is in our blood, passed down from our musical, comical, and artistic families. 
The Derina Harvey Band or dHb have been performing together for years and have been asked on countless occasions by a fantastic and growing group of fans if we had an album to sell.   
 
Our Project
This full length album is relevant and among the next generation of music that is honest and heartfelt. We are currently nearing the end of our recording project, a self titled album of the crowd's favourites. The covers we've chosen are Traditional, Celtic, and Eastern Canadian, however, we have branded them with our creative and energetic rock and roll flavour.
We've been doing this one by the book - professional gear, top engineers, mixing, mastering, photography, digital designers, mechanical rights, and registering. This album looks great and sounds even better! 
 
Our Campaign
Which brings me to the funding. I'm a happily married mother of three producing a top quality product from my heart and my hands. My family will always come first and they've alway supported me.
 I've paid for everything thus far  - pre-production,  studio sessions,  musicians,  engineering,  and mixing - with performance revenue from approximately 150 solo shows & 40 band shows each year.
I'm very proud of this! This project has been a long time coming, as we began this ride back in 2012.  Now that I'm in the last leg of this amazing journey, I am asking YOU to dance and sing across the finish line with me and my band of merry men!  
 
How You Can Help?
This Indiegogo campaign will give you the chance to hear a sample of the music, get your toes tapping, and pre-order the album. Check out the perks too!  
We have digital downloads, signed CDs that we'll mail out to you, high quality t-shirts for men and ladies, and opportunities for you to book me or dHb for your own private party where we'll entertain your friends with our wide range of crowd pleasing tunes.
Your purchase or donation dollars will go directly to the mastering, duplication, and marketing of the Derina Harvey Band album.  
So check out the video clip and have a listen to our version of EXCURSION AROUND THE BAY. Then donate, purchase a CD or t-shirt, or bring us to your garage for a party and be the talk of the town.

<p><em>- Harald Galinski | Studio Founder</em></p>
<h3><em>""You really can't underestimate how important a space like this is to making major motion pictures""</em></h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 240px;"">-Marty Bowen, Producer | <em>Dear John</em> &amp; the <em>Twilight Saga</em></p>
<br/><p><strong>SUMMARY  </strong></p>
<p>In May of 2011, I fulfilled a dream and opened Studio Charleston, South Carolina’s first permanent Film/TV production facility with a vision to help bringing back Film/TV productions, creating new jobs and to help stimulate our regions economy!</p>
<p><strong>WHAT HAPPENED </strong></p>
<p>Last summer, <strong>South Carolina lost its competitive Film Incentives</strong>. Film incentives are rebates provided by the state to the movie makers and are one of the main reasons why productions select a specific state. Without them, the chances of large productions coming back to our state are slim, and Studio Charleston and our S.C. film industry will not be able to survive.</p>
<p>The 70,000 SF studio needs big productions to make it. The facility has been the production hub and stages for major studio productions like <strong>""Dear John""</strong>. It quickly attracted a variety of great clients; a <strong>History Channel</strong> <em>TV Show Pilot</em>, an <strong>Atlantic Records</strong> <em>Music-Video</em> productions and independent feature films, like <strong>""Little Red Wagon""</strong> and the locally produced <strong>""Warrior Road""</strong> - all of which employed local crew &amp; talent, using local vendors and services.</p>
<p><strong>OUR STRATEGY</strong></p>
<p>We are fighting for a couple of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Passing New S.C. Film Incentives, which were successfully introduced first thing this year and have already passed the challenging S.C. State Finance Committee.</li>
<li>Keeping Studio Charleston alive until the new incentives are passed</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>YOU CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN</strong></p>
<p><strong>We Need Your Help</strong> <strong>to raise the money needed to pay the basic operating expenses. </strong>More than ever, we are committed to stay focused on recruiting new Film/TV projects to our beautiful state and pushing to swiftly pass the new incentives.</p>
<p>We have <em>great perks</em> for your contributions; for only $10 you are honored with a permanent <em>""Thank You Recognition""</em> on our website, just $25 will put <em>your name permanently on a plaque at our stage-walk</em>, <em>Exclusive Studio T-Shirt</em> for $50 and perks as unique as <em>NAMING A STAGE</em>. Please remember that even the smallest contribution will make a <em>BIG DIFFERENCE</em>. </p>
<p>Right now, <strong>WE NEED YOUR HELP</strong> <strong>TO MAKE IT HAPPEN!!! </strong></p>

<p>With the encouraging support of my wonderful family, friends and business partners, I have stayed strong and loyal to what I believe in.

We are very close, but it will still take some time and <em><strong>we need your help to stay alive!</strong></em> Together, with your involvement and contributions, we will be able to keep the studio doors open until the new incentives pass, which are currently with our State's legislators, pending votes of approval to pass. </p>
<p>Please be a part of this once in a life time opportunity to bring this unique and rewarding industry back to South Carolina. With your contribution, you will become an important part in the foundation of South Carolina's very first production facility!</p>

<p>Films need big production space: Getting the film industry to come to a state without a production facility like Studio Charleston, offering thousands of square feet of stages, offices and construction area, is like trying to get the New York Yankees to come play baseball in your city when you don’t have a stadium and the cities next door do. They are simply more likely to go there and not your city. Make sense?</p>

- Harald Galinski | Studio Founder
""You really can't underestimate how important a space like this is to making major motion pictures""
-Marty Bowen, Producer | Dear John & the Twilight Saga
SUMMARY  
In May of 2011, I fulfilled a dream and opened Studio Charleston, South Carolina’s first permanent Film/TV production facility with a vision to help bringing back Film/TV productions, creating new jobs and to help stimulate our regions economy!
WHAT HAPPENED 
Last summer, South Carolina lost its competitive Film Incentives. Film incentives are rebates provided by the state to the movie makers and are one of the main reasons why productions select a specific state. Without them, the chances of large productions coming back to our state are slim, and Studio Charleston and our S.C. film industry will not be able to survive.
The 70,000 SF studio needs big productions to make it. The facility has been the production hub and stages for major studio productions like ""Dear John"". It quickly attracted a variety of great clients; a History Channel TV Show Pilot, an Atlantic Records Music-Video productions and independent feature films, like ""Little Red Wagon"" and the locally produced ""Warrior Road"" - all of which employed local crew & talent, using local vendors and services.
OUR STRATEGY
We are fighting for a couple of things:

Passing New S.C. Film Incentives, which were successfully introduced first thing this year and have already passed the challenging S.C. State Finance Committee.
Keeping Studio Charleston alive until the new incentives are passed

YOU CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN
We Need Your Help to raise the money needed to pay the basic operating expenses. More than ever, we are committed to stay focused on recruiting new Film/TV projects to our beautiful state and pushing to swiftly pass the new incentives.
We have great perks for your contributions; for only $10 you are honored with a permanent ""Thank You Recognition"" on our website, just $25 will put your name permanently on a plaque at our stage-walk, Exclusive Studio T-Shirt for $50 and perks as unique as NAMING A STAGE. Please remember that even the smallest contribution will make a BIG DIFFERENCE. 
Right now, WE NEED YOUR HELP TO MAKE IT HAPPEN!!! 
PLEASE CONTRIBUTE TODAY by clicking on one of the perks below or select from the full list to the right:

 
THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTION ! ! !
 
THE FULL STORY....

Having competitive state film incentives in combination with a production facility is key to recruiting new productions to South Carolina. The studio complex now offers a total of 70,000 SF of Creative Production Space - it instantly made South Carolina competitive with our neighboring states.
The facility really is amazing, offering Studio & Stages ranging from 780 SF to 19,500 SF with 40' high ceilings, Equipment Rental, 14,000 SF of Production Offices, Copy Center, plus technical and production management solutions for every scale of production; from one hour Photo Shoots at our turn-key STUDIO A, to month's long Film/TV productions.
 
""Having these massive stage settings in the same space as production offices, conference rooms, construction department and everything else you need to run a project smoothly is perfect"", said Marty Bowen, producer of the successful Twilight Saga, about our facility, which he used as production hub and for soundstages on the production of Nicola’s Sparks “DEAR JOHN”, which employed over 250 crew members in South Carolina.

 
Studio Charleston and its many wonderful supporters have given me the dignity of being uncompromisingly loyal to something I believe in...and to hold on to it. And, above all else, believe, without question, that it will carry on!
With the encouraging support of my wonderful family, friends and business partners, I have stayed strong and loyal to what I believe in. We have focused our energy on what is most important, getting new film incentives passed - the key to our success. We are very close, but it will still take some time and we need your help to stay alive! Together, with your involvement and contributions, we will be able to keep the studio doors open until the new incentives pass, which are currently with our State's legislators, pending votes of approval to pass. 
Please be a part of this once in a life time opportunity to bring this unique and rewarding industry back to South Carolina. With your contribution, you will become an important part in the foundation of South Carolina's very first production facility!
Your contribution will help keep the studio alive while directly influencing our local economy.  Film and TV creates hundreds of everyday jobs for South Carolinians while bringing millions in income to local businesses – and irreplaceable promotional value to our state. Even independent productions, such as the locally produced ""Warrior Road"" feature film, produced by visionary, Charleston based Charliewood Pictures, hire many full-time local Crew Members, Cast & Extras.
By contributing today, you can be the reason why Films & TV shows are made in your neighborhood, our historic streets and throughout this beautiful state! 
>> WHY KEEP STUDIO CHARLESTON OPEN?
Films need big production space: Getting the film industry to come to a state without a production facility like Studio Charleston, offering thousands of square feet of stages, offices and construction area, is like trying to get the New York Yankees to come play baseball in your city when you don’t have a stadium and the cities next door do. They are simply more likely to go there and not your city. Make sense?
Famous film producers,like Marty Bowen, would love to come back with new projects and all it will take is your help.  
>> THE IMPACT
Just one medium size budget film produced in our facility created:


258 High Paying Jobs

4,780 Local Hotel Night Bookings for Cast & Crew alone

$13 Million Spent with South Carolina Businesses

The jobs that the film industry brings are not exclusive to producers, cast and camera crew, but can create work for people like your neighbors, friends or family members in an array of professions, such as:

Electricians

Carpenters
Framers
Landscapers
Caterers
Seamstresses
Policemen
Hair stylists
Truckers
Mechanics… just to name a few! 

On top of creating more jobs, it also increases the income of local business, such as:

Clothing stores

Hair salons
Car rental companies
Equipment rentals
Supply stores
Furniture stores
Restaurants and bars
Food stores
Coffee shops
Taxi companies
Dry cleaners
Hotels
Tourist attractions and many more!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey! Thanks for checking out my campaign, let me tell you a little bit about myself. I'm a young singer-songwriter based out of Montreal. I'm one half of the band Cabin 9, who you might have seen on YouTube. I have big dreams of writing a great award-winning musical (or several, really!) and in order to get there, I'm studying songwriting at Berklee College of Music's online school. Writing lyrics and scripts is my passion and the education I'm getting at Berklee is massively helpful. The one problem is, it's super expensive, and I have to pay for all my expenses myself. This means that in order to do school, I have to work crazy hours and starve myself a little, and that's not super fun. At the rate I'm going at, it will take me about three years to finish my program if I want to avoid going into debt. With your help, I could be done by next summer!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My total tuition is $12,775. I've already paid for two of my courses, so I only need another $10,000 to finish things up, not including book fees. I've set the goal here at $6,000 because I figure getting even half of my total tuition funded by other people would be amazing. If somehow I raise more than $6,000, the extra money will go toward the Open Door, a homeless drop-in center here in Montreal.</p>
<p>If you donate to this campaign, not only will you have my undying gratitude, but you can get some pretty cool stuff out of it as well! Everyone who donates will get thanked publicly, but the higher-level donations will be able to claim shinier perks ;) I'll write you a song about yourself or about a topic of your choice! I'll offer you a two-hour Skype chat where you can pick my brain about music stuff (or really about whatever else you want!) I'll get you tickets to literally everything that I ever do forever! On top of that, my amazingly talented roommate Tim Blais (who you may know as the Acapella Science guy!) has agreed to help me out with the perks, so we as Cabin 9 will perform covers of whatever song you want dedicated to you or a loved one on our YouTube channel! How great is THAT?! You can also get a private concert, a homecooked meal, and a whole bunch of other things! I'm seriously going all out here.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With your help, I'll be able to finish school a lot quicker and with a lot less stress. This will free up more of my time to create great new stuff. This is a really cool opportunity for you to invest not just in a project, but in a person, in their career, and in their future.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Hey, I'm super broke most of the time, so I totally understand if you can't donate anything. You can still help out by sharing the link to this campaign with all your friends and followers! The more people see this page, the better! :)</p>

Thank you. Seriously, Thank you. Without you guys, we wouldn't be at this point of thinking it would be worth our time to put out this record. Even if you are uninspired by any perks or think we're huge assholes for even doing this, thank you for checking it out, in the very least. If you are interested in helping, every $1 helps out in more ways than you could imagine. If you've happened to stroll across this by chance and have never heard of the band before; you can check out our live video for our song titled 'Line to Line' here; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtR-Sokx_RsHopefully we'll be updating you guys throughout the course of this thing with anything new we happen to throw at you. We'll also probably update you all when tracklisting, artwork, EP title gets announced. :)I Will Define is...Cody Wyrick - VocalsCorey Standifer - GuitarsLandon Ziegler - Guitars/VocalsSam Foster - BassSam Gordon - Drums",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>THE PROJECT</h3>
<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cherrysuede.ca/images/RS_Writing.jpeg"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin: 5px;""/><p>This will be our first full-length studio album in over 5 years. We have spent a lot of time writing the new material and we are really excited.</p>
<p>Cherry Suede have been together for about 13 years and have played over 2000 shows and there's no intention of stopping anytime soon. We hope this campaign can give us a boost so we can play more cities and more venues.</p>
<p class=""p1"">“Between Here and There”, the name of our new album and tour, embraces the core idea of human connection at every level.  Each aspect of this album, from the songs, to the way in which we record them, to the way we tour and share our live shows, is about bridging a gap between us all, through the power of music. And hopefully along this journey, we can make some memories. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET</h3>
<p>Until now, we have always funded our projects privately and through heavy touring, but this time around we are coming to you, the Cherry Suede Brigade, to be a part of the team.</p>
<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cherrysuede.ca/images/hob1.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;""/><p>The first Cherry Suede album cost close to $60 000 just to record, and even more to tour - and as you know, we gave away the download of that album for free.</p>
<p>Luckily, new advancements in recording have helped bring down certain costs, but at the same time, these new technologies have made many traditional income sources obsolete. Not to mention that the cost of touring has increased dramatically. Just the gas prices alone make it very expensive to tour.</p>
<p>So here’s how we plan to proceed.</p>
<h3>Day One - even if we raise only $1</h3>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cherrysuede.ca/images/map-of-us.png"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin: 5px;""/></p>
<p>We will guarantee these cities on the tour:</p>
<ul>
<li>Montreal</li>
<li>Ottawa</li>
<li>Toronto</li>
<li>NYC</li>
<li>Asbury Park</li>
<li>Los Angeles</li>
</ul>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>$15 000 mark (our official IndieGoGo target)</h3>
<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cherrysuede.ca/images/map-of-uk.png"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin: 5px;""/><p>This is our absolute minimum budget. This also releases an additional 5% of the funding back to us as a bonus from IndieGoGo.. At this point we can guarantee these cities:</p>
<ul>
<li>London, UK</li>
<li>Brighton, UK</li>
<li>Manchester, UK</li>
<li>Glasgow, UK</li>
<li>Edinburgh, UK</li>
<li>Aberdeen, UK</li>
<li>Philadelphia, PA</li>
<li>Boston, MA</li>
<li>San Diego, CA</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll do our best to add a few extra cities to this list - but these ones we can GUARANTEE we’ll hit, provided we achieve our goal of $15 000.</p>
<p>But please keep in mind, the TRUE budget to make all this happen is closer to $50 000 before we’ll actually see any sort of profit.</p>
<h3>“Stretch Targets” - THE ROAD TO $50 000</h3>
<p>A stretch target is simply a milestone beyond our minimum goal. At every Stretch Target, we will offer bonuses to the early-bird backers, plus we’ll be able to release more of the limited bundles, so we can work together to get us to $50K.</p>
<p>Every target we reach unlocks a new set of bonuses and possibilities. (20K, 30k, 40K, 50K)</p>
<p>Think of it as a “Beat the Clock” challenge. The longer you wait for a big ticket bundle, the more it may cost - or worse yet- it may be sold out altogether.</p>
<p>So please back early.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cherrysuede.ca/images/map-of-world.png"" src="""" style=""margin: 5px; float: right;""/></p>
<h3>We will add new cities based on demand and proximity.</h3>
<p>This may include additional UK cities, as well as additional US and Canadian cities - we might even be able to look at other countries.</p>
<p>If your city is not yet on a list, we encourage you to buy a ticket and help create awareness for your town. If we see enough backers - your city will jump to the top of the list of considerations. </p>
<p>So you can see how important it is for us to hit our minimum goal early, so we can put the album and tour into motion.</p>

<h2>THE BUDGET</h2>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cherrysuede.ca/images/graph.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>Here’s a rough breakdown on how the money will be spent:</p>
<h3>Service Charges (IndieGoGo and Paypal)</h3>
<p>Roughly about 10- 12% (drops by 5% once we hit $15 000 goal)</p>
<h3>The New Album/Song Book Companion: 30%</h3>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cherrysuede.ca/images/day_lyric_scan.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;""/>This will be a collection of life-inspired songs that we feel are some of our best songs yet. We have some new touching ballads, plus a handful of pure rock and roll tunes to get the blood pumping, not to mention a few that we have yet to write.</p>
<p>The song book is a companion piece for those who yearn for the days of going to the record store, buying an album or CD, getting home and putting it on while flipping through the accompanying booklet. </p>
<h3>The Tour: 50%</h3>
<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cherrysuede.ca/images/capital.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin: 5px;""/><p>The ”Between Here and There” Tour is already off to a great start, having sold out shows in Montreal and Ottawa. We also hit Toronto and New Jersey, and with your support, we’ll just keep adding to our list of cities.</p>
<p>It roughly costs, on average, about $2500 for us to play each city (travel, accommodations, gas, promotion, venue charges etc).  So you can see how it adds up quick and why this is the majority of the budget.</p>
<h3>The Online Experience: 10%</h3>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cherrysuede.ca/images/camera.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin: 5px; float: right;""/>The online experience we’re creating at CherrySuede.com will provide the means to watch the making of the album, and participate in live shows from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>We've tested every system out there - every platform, every streaming option, every indie music service - and decided that we just need to build our own. And that is what we've done.</p>
<p>The new cherrysuede.com is being custom built, from top to bottom, so that every single aspect of the site is geared to a more fun and interactive CSB experience.</p>
<h2>PERKS FOR BACKING US EARLY</h2>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cherrysuede.ca/images/bonus.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin: 5px; float: right;""/></p>
<p>Take a look at the far upper right corner of this page, that's how many days we have left for these perks at these prices.</p>
<p>Each perk level builds upon the previous level. The more you’re able to offer in support, the more we can offer as a reward.</p>
<p><strong>To buy a perk, simply click any red button.</strong></p>
<h3>How much?</h3>
<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cherrysuede.ca/images/Birmingham.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin: 5px;""/><p>That's up to you. Any amount from $5 on up allows you to get the album and become part of the experience. If every one of our 12 000 fans gave only $5, we would easily hit our target.</p>
<p>Realistically only 10% will buy - which means if you each bought a CD/Show ticket ($50)- we'd still be set.</p>
<p>The more you spend, the more perks (limited edition CDs, song book, show tickets, trips, etc...) and you'll be helping us make a better album and bigger tour.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: You will be charged right away via paypal but you DO NOT need a paypal account - you can simply use your credit card like you would anywhere else.</strong></p>
<p>A benefit of PayPal is that it has the ability for people to also use their bank accounts to transfer funds. That way people who do not have a credit card can still participate.</p>
<h3>PLEASE BACK US EARLY</h3>
<p>By backing early, not only we will hit our goals sooner so that we can start offering bonuses, but you'll also encourage other backers to join in and create a momentum that will help us cross the ultimate finish line.</p>
<h3>What if we exceed our goal?</h3>
<p>We’re hoping we do. Like we said, we are only asking for a minimum to get this going, but the true budget is 3 to 5 times that minimum amount of $15 000.  If we exceed our goal, we start aiming for those Stretch Targets which, once attained, will allow us to reward early backers with special bonuses, as well add new cities to the tour.</p>
<p>So, please, become a backer now. It's quick, it's easy! (just like RS :P )</p>
<h2>YOUR IMPACT</h2>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cherrysuede.ca/images/csb.jpeg"" src="""" style=""margin: 5px; float: right;""/>For Cherry Suede, next to the music, the most important thing we hold close to our hearts is our community of fans.  Why? Because we feel very strongly that music is a two-way street; a symbiotic relationship between artist and fan. Throughout history, this relationship could only truly exist in a live environment. </p>
<p>But thanks to today's technologies, this is no longer the case.  It’s now possible for us to include everyone in any and every aspect of our tour and creative process. Just this idea alone makes it one of the most incredible times in history to be an artist. It’s like the beginning of rock and roll all over again, this time with the internet and mobile devices.</p>

<p>We are asking <em>YOU</em> to be a participant in breathing life into Fred Friction’s much anticipated new CD <strong><em>“MURDER BALLADEER”</em></strong>. The songs are written and waiting to be recorded.</p>
<p>We need your help to get Fred into the recording studio. Your contributions will help pay for the recording studio time, the mastering and producing of the recording along with the pressing of the CD, cover/promotional artwork, production of a lyric book illustrated by Fred Friction and promotional merchandise for the CD release. Any monies left over after those costs are met will be put towards media-press promotion of the new CD.</p>
<p>Crowd sourcing seemed the perfect first approach to raising the needed funds and Indiegogo won hands down as the funding platform to use.</p>
<p align=""center""><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p align=""center""><strong><em>JUST WHO IS THIS FRED FRICTION?</em></strong></p>
<p>Those of you who know Fred… ‘<em>KNOW FRED’</em>. He is a character not easily forgotten once met. For those who have never met Fred Friction… it’s time you did. And there is no better way to meet Fred then through his music.</p>
<p>Fred Friction is one of St. Louis, MO’s legendary iconic songwriters, classic spoon player, radio celebrity, poet and musician. Fred first made a name for himself in the St. Louis music scene as producer and frontman of <em>A Night of a 1,000 Spoons</em>, a highlight among the many themed shows in the early St. Louis indie rock scene and as a sideman on spoons with <em>Enormous Richard</em>.  With Mark Stephens, he formed <em>The Highway Matrons</em> in 1994 and began to emerge as a major songwriter. He also is an important tastemaker as volunteer host for the past 13 years of <em>Fishin’ with Dynamite</em> on <em>KDHX 88.1</em>  St. Louis’ independent radio station and former owner of the seminal <em>Frederick’s Music Lounge</em>. His poetry talent has been utilized by <em>Poetry Scores</em>; a non-profit organization that translates poetry into other media. They score long poems as you would a movie, then make silent movies to the scores. He has been featured on two of their international audio projects.</p>

We are asking YOU to be a participant in breathing life into Fred Friction’s much anticipated new CD “MURDER BALLADEER”. The songs are written and waiting to be recorded.
We need your help to get Fred into the recording studio. Your contributions will help pay for the recording studio time, the mastering and producing of the recording along with the pressing of the CD, cover/promotional artwork, production of a lyric book illustrated by Fred Friction and promotional merchandise for the CD release. Any monies left over after those costs are met will be put towards media-press promotion of the new CD.
Crowd sourcing seemed the perfect first approach to raising the needed funds and Indiegogo won hands down as the funding platform to use.
 
JUST WHO IS THIS FRED FRICTION?
Those of you who know Fred… ‘KNOW FRED’. He is a character not easily forgotten once met. For those who have never met Fred Friction… it’s time you did. And there is no better way to meet Fred then through his music.
Fred Friction is one of St. Louis, MO’s legendary iconic songwriters, classic spoon player, radio celebrity, poet and musician. Fred first made a name for himself in the St. Louis music scene as producer and frontman of A Night of a 1,000 Spoons, a highlight among the many themed shows in the early St. Louis indie rock scene and as a sideman on spoons with Enormous Richard.  With Mark Stephens, he formed The Highway Matrons in 1994 and began to emerge as a major songwriter.

<p></p>
<a href=""http://fraserandgirard.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fraser &amp; Girard</a> is an unstoppable combination, and audiences everywhere agree. <br/>You cannot argue with the power of these two lives merging.<br/>Both grew up in the folk revival of the '60's and '70's, and the rock music explosion. Both are born wordsmiths and were destined from the earliest years to be writers and musicians. Each has had a solo career spanning over four decades, with the stories that go with it. <br/>Marianne was raised in the tobacco belt of southwestern Ontario, west of London on old Hwy 2. Her musical training began in the church choir and school choir.<br/>Allan was born in Windsor, Nova Scotia, and raised in Sherbrooke, QC. As early as 12 yrs. of age he appeared on Don Messer's Jubilee, Singalong Jubilee, The Tommy Hunter Show, The Elwood Glover Show..... this is taking you waaaaay back, folks!<br/><h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What We Need And What You Get. <br/>
</h3>
</div><div>
<ul>
<li>We need $15,000. Split three ways: a) album production, b) mastering, album design, manufacturing and, c) promotion/publicity.  <br/>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>We have a lot of innovative perks for you, as you can see on the list. </li>
<li>There
 is a dual purpose here for us: we need your support, and we see this as a great way to highlight and honour <i>your </i>involvement in this project.</li>
<li>We'll
 keep you in the loop, updating regularly with photos and videos from 
the studio, and hope you share our excitement as we bring this work to 
fruition. </li>

<b>And..... we need cat sitters! </b>Meet Jeremiah and Delilah, two newly adopted Bluepoint Siamese. Aren't they beautiful? And so very mellow, friendly, and  cuddly. </li>

<li>They 
came from a very loving home, but Delilah had a harsh past before that.

</li>
<li><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/870804/files/20140920145519-Delilah_web1.jpg?1411250119"" src="""" style=""width: 454px; height: 475px;""/></p></li>
<li>Her rescuers said she never stopped purring, even while the vet was operating on her. She's a 
very small cat, her little left hip shows permanent signs of her injury. She has such a sweet disposition you'd never believe she'd  had this trauma.</li>

<p>Jeremiah (Jerry) and Delilah met in a shelter and are inseparable. Jerry is very protective of Delilah, and of his new home. They came to us no more than 3 months ago.  And, just as quickly as they entered our lives, we became very busy, with many new prospects knocking at 
our door, including this recording. We feel they brought this prosperity and 
happiness to us, and want them to <b>have the best possible care whenever we go on 
the road. </b><br/></p>
</ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact <ul><li>Why this campaign is valuable to you as the contributor:                                   <br/>
</li></ul>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Individually, we have each been recognized</b> as influential and valuable artists. This album brings two lifetimes of song, and more than twice the impact.  We're working with one of the best producers in Canada, <a href=""http://themillstream.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Paul Mills </a>. Bass player, <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/598429-Dennis-Pendrith"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dennis Pendrith</a> (Gordon Lightfoot, Bruce Cockburn, Murray McLaughlin, Raffi, Sylvia Tyson, Fraser &amp; deBolt) will be the first studio musician on Sept. 25, on his double bass. This establishes world class bedtracks and sets the stage for further stellar musical contributions.<br/>
</li> <br/><li>
<b>Many of you are already aware </b>that the music industry is not what it used to be. Most, if not all of the onus of recording, marketing, and booking falls on the artist, while trying to sustain a high level of creativity. A very daunting job, to say the least. Your contribution allows us to work with the best people in Canada, bring our music to you and promote worldwide, and to make time to allow more great songs to emerge. <br/>
</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p> <ul>
<li>
<b>Our ultimate goal</b> is to become self-sustaining in the music industry. We'll do this by touring and performance, t.v. and radio royalties. We've already begun to do this even before we've started recording as a duo. The debut album of Fraser &amp; Girard will propel our intentions even further afield. And it will be you, our music community that helps make this happen.  We have the music, solidly,  and you can help to provide the vehicle to move it forward and be further recognized as viable and significant work.</li>
<li>
<b>Challenges we face</b> are maintaining our health while keeping up the pace required in this business. Touring is physically and mentally wearing: we are spry, but not spring chickens! Remembering to eat and sleep well, and most of all....not worry, is something we all face. <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>How can we overcome this?</b> We are seasoned citizens of the gypsy life of musicians... we know how to do this, under any circumstance, but it sure makes a difference knowing we have a little financial cushion. <br/>
</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <ul>
<li>Not everyone can contribute monetarily. <b>We value your support at every level.</b>  Tell your friends. Share this campaign. Share on Facebook and Twitter and all social media. Like us. Like our music. Enjoy what we bring to you. Somewhere along the line, we'd love to meet you. <br/>
</li> </ul>

You cannot argue with the power of these two lives merging.Both grew up in the folk revival of the '60's and '70's, and the rock music explosion. Both are born wordsmiths and were destined from the earliest years to be writers and musicians. Each has had a solo career spanning over four decades, with the stories that go with it. Marianne was raised in the tobacco belt of southwestern Ontario, west of London on old Hwy 2. Her musical training began in the church choir and school choir.Allan was born in Windsor, Nova Scotia, and raised in Sherbrooke, QC. As early as 12 yrs. of age he appeared on Don Messer's Jubilee, Singalong Jubilee, The Tommy Hunter Show, The Elwood Glover Show..... this is taking you waaaaay back, folks!
What We Need And What You Get. 



We need $15,000. Split three ways: a) album production, b) mastering, album design, manufacturing and, c) promotion/publicity.  



We have a lot of innovative perks for you, as you can see on the list. 
There
 is a dual purpose here for us: we need your support, and we see this as a great way to highlight and honour your involvement in this project.
We'll
 keep you in the loop, updating regularly with photos and videos from 
the studio, and hope you share our excitement as we bring this work to 
fruition. 




And..... we need cat sitters! Meet Jeremiah and Delilah, two newly adopted Bluepoint Siamese. Aren't they beautiful? And so very mellow, friendly, and  cuddly. 

They 
came from a very loving home, but Delilah had a harsh past before that. 
She'd been thrown from a car and was found in a stairwell with a broken hind leg. Who would do this?         


Her rescuers said she never stopped purring, even while the vet was operating on her. She's a 
very small cat, her little left hip shows permanent signs of her injury. She has such a sweet disposition you'd never believe she'd  had this trauma.

Jeremiah (Jerry) and Delilah met in a shelter and are inseparable. Jerry is very protective of Delilah, and of his new home. They came to us no more than 3 months ago.  And, just as quickly as they entered our lives, we became very busy, with many new prospects knocking at 
our door, including this recording. We feel they brought this prosperity and 
happiness to us, and want them to have the best possible care whenever we go on 
the road. 

  The Impact Why this campaign is valuable to you as the contributor:                                   




Individually, we have each been recognized as influential and valuable artists. This album brings two lifetimes of song, and more than twice the impact.  We're working with one of the best producers in Canada, Paul Mills . Bass player, Dennis Pendrith (Gordon Lightfoot, Bruce Cockburn, Murray McLaughlin, Raffi, Sylvia Tyson, Fraser & deBolt) will be the first studio musician on Sept. 25, on his double bass. This establishes world class bedtracks and sets the stage for further stellar musical contributions.
 
Many of you are already aware that the music industry is not what it used to be. Most, if not all of the onus of recording, marketing, and booking falls on the artist, while trying to sustain a high level of creativity. A very daunting job, to say the least. Your contribution allows us to work with the best people in Canada, bring our music to you and promote worldwide, and to make time to allow more great songs to emerge. 
 
  Risks & Challenges   

Our ultimate goal is to become self-sustaining in the music industry. We'll do this by touring and performance, t.v. and radio royalties. We've already begun to do this even before we've started recording as a duo. The debut album of Fraser & Girard will propel our intentions even further afield. And it will be you, our music community that helps make this happen.  We have the music, solidly,  and you can help to provide the vehicle to move it forward and be further recognized as viable and significant work.

Challenges we face are maintaining our health while keeping up the pace required in this business. Touring is physically and mentally wearing: we are spry, but not spring chickens! Remembering to eat and sleep well, and most of all....not worry, is something we all face. 


How can we overcome this? We are seasoned citizens of the gypsy life of musicians... we know how to do this, under any circumstance, but it sure makes a difference knowing we have a little financial cushion.

Anchorage…    is more than a group of five dear-friends coming together to play music. With a tangible passion for creativity and expression, it is the coalescence of like minds and emotions. Constant drive and determination help them to push forward with each day, but above all else it is the music itself that gives meaning to Anchorage.  It is the belief that through passion and hard-work positivity and community can flourish.

For the past seven months…Anchorage has worked diligently in breaking down emotional and mental barriers in order to create a sound that is uniquely their own.  Drawing influences from all walks of musical life – jazz, funk, alternative rock, folk, metal, electronica – the combined creative force has finished what is to be their most daring and proud collection of work to date.  The loss of dear friends and members to the band, looming deadlines, and the difficult decision to embrace a more open musical style has given Anchorage strength through adversity. With patience and a determined passion to accomplish any goal, Anchorage continues to press forward fearlessly.
 All of the money raised…will help fund various expenses that Anchorage believes will truly help them market themselves as a professional and determined small business. The overall fundraising goal of $2500 will finance 33% of the total costs that will be accrued over the next few months.  Of the net total:
• 43% will go toward recording a new full-length album, and will account for all travel expenses.  
• 34% will go toward gas needed touring during the month of February. 
• 10% will help restock merchandise
• 4% will afford the physical pressing of our full-length album.
• 4% will support Karen Du of Klavicoal Media who helped produce our Indiegogo video.
• 2% will help launch the Anchorage website.
 
With your help…Anchorage can become something greater than the five friends could ever hope to achieve on their own.  A financial contribution of any kind is support to the belief that music is about more than living a rock and roll lifestyle -- more than parties, and fame, and superficialities.  Music is about creativity and passion.  It’s about unity and the human collective.  Together we can make a difference, and with your support this shared dream can become a reality.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>""No one can stop me, I won't be bound, I'll fight for love I'll fight it loud... I've got my Iron Fist""</h3>
<p>That is a quote from a song on the album I'm currently working on. My name is Jack Mozie. I'm working on releasing it on April 9th and I need your help! I learned many things from working on my first album. The most important thing I learned is that in order to have a successful album launch you need a lot of support... and a budget. </p>
<p>I am in great need of as much help as I can get. This album is of great importance to me. In these last two years I have learned a lot helping in the community and fighting for Marriage Equality in Washington. I wanted to make an album that told my story; the story of how I found my identity and fight for love and equality every day. </p>
<p>Your contributions will take my album to the next level. There is software needed, promotion costs, distribution costs and more. With your help I can make a great album and not starve for a year. Any amount of great help. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>This is why I need your funding:</h3>
<p>Distribution costs alone add up to $1750. This is including physical and digital distribution. With this money I could easily eat for many many days and with your help I can keep it that way. </p>
<p>Mastering is gonna add another $550 to the cost. The mastering process is needed for an album to be successful and of course, for it to sound good. </p>
<p>I need different pieces of software and hardware that add up to another good $1000+ (and more if I buy the hardware instead of renting... your funding will decide that I guess)</p>
<p>Promotional Costs are at $2200 right now for posters, flyers, wristbands, flyin discs, facebook ads, and more. Before you bail on this one let me tell you that without a proper budget for marketing and promotion the last you will probably hear of this album is well, this fundraiser. This is one of the most important parts. So please help with as much as you can!</p>
<h3>Cool stuff I want to give you:</h3>
<p>I want to give you a copy of my album. I cannot give one to everyone however, so if you donate $25 or more I'll throw you a copy of the album, and why not? A cool wristband.</p>
<p>If you are in a position to give more than that, then I would love to give you more as well! If you can donate $100 or more you get a Flying Disc with the album name on it and my autograph. And while I'm at it I will also give you the album and wristband. </p>
<p>If you can donate $250 or more, not only do I want you to buy me dinner but I will send you 4 tickets to my album release concert, bring you up on stage with me and give you a hug. And yes, you also get the album, wristband and flying disc. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I want to use this record to begin my career as a recording artist, and share my experience with others about social change, LGBT rights, youth empowerment and more. </p>
<p>I want to use the money made by this album to take it on tour with me. I need this album to be successful because a part of the tour proceeds are being donated to Social Outreach Seattle (<a href=""http://www.socialoutreachseattle.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.socialoutreachseattle.com</a>) to bring equality for LGBT people and their allies in Washington. A successful album adds to a successful tour. </p>
<p>Your help can have an impact on an album and tour that fights for LGBT rights and youth empowerment. </p>
<p>Feel free to contact me (<a href=""mailto:jackmozie@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">jackmozie@gmail.com</a>) if you want to ask me anything related to the project. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Money is of great assistance to the success of my album but it isn't the only way you can help. If you share my passion for LGBT rights and pop music but can't donate at the moment then help me get the word out. </p>
<p>Passion is perhaps what will fuel this fundraiser and make it successful. Share it on facebook, text your friend about it, blog about it, tell your local newspaper. Any way you get the word out about it can help bring more funding. </p>
<p>Thank you in advanced and I hope we can be successful,</p>
<p>Jack</p>

<h4 style=""text-align: center;"">Hello Stranger!</h4>
<p><br/></p>
<p>       My name is Krzysztof Mickiewicz, I'm 22 and I'm a student at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland in Glasgow, Scotland. I've been studying double bass at the conservatoire for the last three years, but before that I was attending two different music schools in Poland. Oh, I'm Polish, I forgot to add.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">       I was born in Szczecin, Poland, and spent most of my life there, but then I moved to Scotland seeking</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> luck - and I believe I found it. I have an amazing teacher, Nicholas Bayley, who's also one of the greatest musicians I've ever met, many good friends and I feel motivated to work by the great artistic atmosphere of the place.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">       I put a lot of passion into my work as a musician. Every hour spent on practice makes me feel even more enthusiastic about what I do. Well...okay, not every hour, because there are some hard times as well - but at the end of the day I'm always glad and feel very proud of what I do. I love playing my instrument.</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4 style=""text-align: center;""><b>The problem</b></h4>
<p><br/></p>
<p>       The only problem is... that I don't have an instrument. I have never had one. I come from a family with a lower middle income and my parents have never been able to help me to purchase a bass. Throughout all those years I have been using so many different double basses that I couldn't even count them all, but none of them was ever mine. When I came to Glasgow I was very lucky to get support from the conservatoire and be let to borrow and instrument from it, but as it happens it is my last year of the Bachelor degree and soon (hopefully) I'll be starting the postgraduate studies and soon after I'll have to start working as well if I want to be able to afford the course. However, as I mentioned before, I am not allowed to use the academic instrument for professional work. And so the problem persists...</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4 style=""text-align: center;""><b>The solution</b></h4>
<p><br/></p>
<p>       In order to become a professional musician I need all the help I can get. When I found Indiegogo I decided that I should give it a try definitely. I believe this is the place which will finally help my dreams to come true.</p>
<p>       I need about 5000 pounds, because this is an average price of a good standard double bass in the United Kingdom. However, what bass I will get depends on how much money I'll be able to collect. I also consider buying an instrument in a different country, if I find an appropriate one within a reasonable price range.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4 style=""text-align: center;"">The outcome</h4>
<p><br/></p>
<p>      Once I have a proper instrument, I will be able to start working professionally as an orchestral musician, while widening my solo repertoire and improving my skills during the Master of Music course at the conservatoire.</p>
<p>      I am asking you today to help my cause in any way you can - not everyone can afford supporting a stranger with their change, I totally understand it! Just share this campaign with your friends on Facebook, Twitter, anywhere and I'll be just as grateful as if you contributed with cash.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">     Right now I can't give you much in return, but you will have my gratitude for life. And after that too.</span></p>

big band for the Jersey Jazz Society's jazz week series at a library in New
Jersey.  She wanted Mike to give her some idea of what it would cost to
book that band.  Mike told her he didn't know the answer to that question
since he was not the leader.  All he could tell her was that he was
receiving $1,000 per concert and there were 17 members, plus the leader's fee
which would probably be higher.  She called back a half hour later with
the news that the fees were way too high for their budget and asked if he had
any other ideas.  Mike told her that over the past 10 years or so he had
been commissioned by saxophonist James Moody to write several big band charts
for Moody to use in performances with college bands on tours he was doing in
conjunction with master classes.  Also Mike stated he had the scores from
some of the big band music he had written for Dizzy Gillespie during his tenure
with that group.  The only thing he didn't have was the musicians to play
it.  Fortunately the agent's call had interrupted a private lesson Mike
was giving to Bob Magnuson, one of the most sought after musicians in the New
York scene at the time.  Bob, upon overhearing the conversation, became
quite agitated and began whispering and gesturing to Mike, ""Take the gig!
 I will get you the musicians!"".  Needless to say, Bob put
together an aggregation of 17 of the top musicians based in New York and in the
world for that matter. </span></p><p></p></span><p></p>

<p></p></div>","How You Can Become Part Of A History-Making Recording Event
On July 23rd of this year a new event was recorded that has been bringing joy and lifting the spirits of everyone who has heard it.
If you have ever attended a concert by The New
York State of the Art Jazz Ensemble at the Gillespie Auditorium and
experienced the overwhelming feelings of joy and excitement that accompany such
an event, you and countless others will now be able to relive this experience
every time you play this fabulous CD.
Not
everyone can afford an expensive trip to New York to have the type of New York
experience this group provides. 
You will be saving those who live outside of the Metropolitan New York area
a lot of money, as well as providing them with a unique and wonderful
experience they may never have if this project fails to be released. 
The
fact that an experience like this has been captured LIVE on a recording is
unique in itself, and if released, can give you and others the opportunity of
enjoying this type of experience in the comfort of your own home.
Most
people, like you, are always in hope of experiencing something of this caliber
whenever they go out and are often disappointed by a lackluster or mediocre
performance.  A recording of this
magnitude will give you the kind of experience you crave every time you listen
to it saving you the time of traveling to a concert venue by effortlessly hitting
the on/off switch on your CD player.
The
New York State of the Art Jazz Ensemble can swing you into good
health, so to speak, whenever you hear their powerful music.  This letter sent
by world-renowned author and playwrite Kirpal Gordon, who attended one such
concert says it all.
Dear Dotty,
This is just to say I'm still hearing that beautiful music
Mike's big band played Wednesday evening at the Baha'i Center!  Mike's
charts, the solos each player took, the song selection and the way the band
blended their instruments into a whole and integral sound: in a word, WOW!
In other words: I felt this warm, effusive, wonderful
feeling of love enveloping me and the rest of the audience.  Yes, they
swung, as they say (and what else would one expect with the line-up of players
Mike assembled?), and I couldn’t stop tapping my feet, but that’s  not the
half of it.  I found this music, and the dedication of the musicians
playing it, connecting me to a world inside this world.  This was the kind
of show I would have wanted everyone in my extended family---from  my
immigrant grandparents to my great-niece and nephew---to hear.  Age didn’t
matter ; the concert defied demographics and decades, genres and styles. 
It put the muse back in the word music.  Mike is really carrying on
Dizzie’s legacy, Dotty.  I’m a soul in wonder.
Please call on me if in any way I can help bring this
treasure to more people.
Warmest regards,
Kirpal Gordon
 Most
people would consider it a praiseworthy act to donate to such a deserving
project that will not only bring joy to so many people, but will gain in
popularity once it is released -- thanks to your efforts.
Since
people around the world have seen videos of this band on YouTube it can’t help
but have created curiosity about what this great group would sound like on a
professionally produced recording with the highest quality of stereo
sound. 
One of the reasons we need to release this recording is because
we haven't released a CD on this group since 2004 due to the prohibitive costs
of doing so with a group of this size. 
Helping this gem to be released will enable people in all walks of life
to have a thing of beauty in their possession that will satisfy their appetite
for fine music through the many repeated listenings inspired by this wonderful
musical experience.
By being on the list of contributors that made this happen, you
will undoubtedly be seen as an individual of unique and admirable taste.
Others who are among the more sophisticated appreciators of
quality music will surely notice your reputation as a supporter of deserving
and quality art.

Now here’s the rub.  We need funding to produce a recording of this magnitude. For example:
1)  Union scale for the 17 musicians who performed on the recording.
2)  Cost of producing the recording
3)  Post production costs including mixing and mastering to ensure you the highest quality in sound production
4)  Cover and art work to create the packaging
5)  Manufacturing costs of the CDs themselves
6)  Marketing costs including radio promotion and press promotion.
7)  Distribution costs including retail as well as on line distribution. 
There is no way that we can sustain these costs ourselves.
All in all we need to raise around $16,500 to accomplish this task and we have 30 days in which to do it.  Won’t you take part in bringing this historic event to the public and help stimulate the love and interest in jazz once again?
No contribution is too small!  Please check out the exciting perks on the right  that you can choose at different levels of funding.  We will be forever grateful for the support you give us.
Thanks so much!
Mike and Dottie Longo 
How It All Started:
Back in 1999 an exciting new musical group was formed called the
New York State of the Art Jazz Ensemble.  It was a 17-piece
band started by jazz pianist/composer Mike Longo who had been Dizzy Gillespie's
pianist and musical director for many years.  Mike also had been a private
student of the great Oscar Peterson. 
The big band came about quite by accident in 1999 when Mike got
a call from his agent inquiring about booking the Dizzy Gillespie All Star
Band, which Mike was a member of at that time.  She was trying to engage a
big band for the Jersey Jazz Society's jazz week series at a library in New

book that band.  Mike told her he didn't know the answer to that question
since he was not the leader.  All he could tell her was that he was

which would probably be higher.  She called back a half hour later with
the news that the fees were way too high for their budget and asked if he had
any other ideas.  Mike told her that over the past 10 years or so he had
been commissioned by saxophonist James Moody to write several big band charts
for Moody to use in performances with college bands on tours he was doing in
conjunction with master classes.  Also Mike stated he had the scores from
some of the big band music he had written for Dizzy Gillespie during his tenure

Shortly thereafter, Mike was to leave for the Pori Jazz Festival
in Finland for a 9-day stint.  While there, he had been given a luxurious

 They rehearsed the new music and played their first gig for the Jersey

who were knocked out by their music.
After the concert the musicians kept prodding Mike to keep this
band together on a permanent basis.  When they first began they had 13
arrangements in the book -- just enough to play the concert in New Jersey.
 Fast forward to 2013 . . . . . The New York State of the Art
Jazz Ensemble has over 150 blockbuster arrangements, mostly composed
and arranged by Mike Longo. 
In the beginning, word spread about the quality of this band and
its music which led to bookings at several festivals and New York jazz clubs
like Birdland and others.  Around that time, the band was recorded and 3
CDs were released between 2001 and 2004.  All 3 of these landed in the Top
10 on the national airplay charts.  One was voted in the Top 10 CDs of
the year in the South American Jazz Poll and the latest in 2004, called Oasis
caused them to be voted Band of the Year and Mike came in second behind Dave
Brubeck for Composer of the Year in the same poll. 
This brings us to the point of why we are sharing all of this

environment of the Gillespie Auditorium.  Many of you reading this have
probably experienced this yourselves and many of you also contributed to our
successful 2012 Kickstarter campaign to keep operating in 2013.  As a
result of your generosity we have launched a successful advertising campaign
and have obtained a way for accepting tax-deductable donations.  We are
now in the process of obtaining grants and funding for the operating expenses
of the jazz series. 
 Now to get to the point of this document..  In an article
around the turn of the century, jazz journalist Owen Cordle made reference to
live jazz as being the “salvation of jazz.”  For the past few years now we
have been recording the live concerts at our venue and learning from this how
to refine our recording techniques to the point now that we are able to produce
live recordings of professional quality and high level stereo recordings
capable of being released by professional record labels. 
The concert on July 23rd in which the Ensemble was literally “on fire”  filled the air with electric excitement.  The outstanding solo and ensemble work was
elevating the audience to heights rarely reached in performances of late and
almost never captured on a recording.  Fortunately this one was, and it
reflects all the above-mentioned excitement and energy emanating from both the
stage and throughout the audience. 
We want to bring this marvelous experience to those of you who
missed the concert as well as provide this memorable occasion to those of you
who experienced it by releasing this recording.  And believe me, it is an
experience  you will never forget and one that will have you engaged in
repeated listening for years to come.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</h3><h2 style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Reproduction of
Lui Stories.</h2><p><b><br/></b></p><p>
</p><p>Hi, my name is Lia Luisa Abella-Castillo, more widely known
as Lui, and I’m a singer-songwriter in the Philippines.</p>
<p>I’ve been in the local music industry for about roughly
seven years, in and out, as I’ve gotten married, borne a child, lost one, and
separated.  All throughout, my one
constant thing and lifeline has been music.  </p>
<p>The thing is, I have this one E.P. that I produced myself
two years ago with the help of family and friends called “Lui. Stories.”  It has 4 tracks, 2 in English and 2 in
Tagalog, which is our native tongue. 
Everybody has been really supportive of me being into music.  But all 250 copies of that E.P. is
gone, and most of it I have just given away as a sort of business card to recording
companies, managers, and agents and only about 40 pcs. were bought.  Which is not enough to cover even 1/8

<br/></div>","The Reproduction of
Lui Stories.
Hi, my name is Lia Luisa Abella-Castillo, more widely known
as Lui, and I’m a singer-songwriter in the Philippines.
I’ve been in the local music industry for about roughly
seven years, in and out, as I’ve gotten married, borne a child, lost one, and
separated.  All throughout, my one
constant thing and lifeline has been music.  
The thing is, I have this one E.P. that I produced myself
two years ago with the help of family and friends called “Lui. Stories.”  It has 4 tracks, 2 in English and 2 in
Tagalog, which is our native tongue. 
Everybody has been really supportive of me being into music.  But all 250 copies of that E.P. is
gone, and most of it I have just given away as a sort of business card to recording
companies, managers, and agents and only about 40 pcs. were bought.  Which is not enough to cover even 1/8
of the recording, the mixing, and the making of the E.P.  
I am here because I’d like to have that E.P. reproduced in
500 more copies, which I will sell at a minimal amount (about $3.5) to be able
to fund the recording of hopefully a 5 or 7-song E.P. this time, depending on
how much we are able to raise here together :)  I want to make more copies of these four incredible songs
instead of going right ahead to making the second E.P. because the passion, the work and the time that I've put into it is not even close to equally reaching it’s full potential to get through to the people I know in my heart they’re supposed
to reach.  
(In the video attached atop, the song at the end part is the first song of the E.P. - those are not the original lyrics though hehee)



What We Need & What You Get
The plan is to raise up $700 to reproduce 500 copies (it’s
about $1.5 / CD which includes the mass production of CD with sticker, and the E.P. cover) by February 2014.

<p>My name is Brandon McGuiness and I've been creating music all my life.  I'm a singer/songwriter living in Nashville, TN.  I'm passionate about my music and I believe that I am meant to share it with people.  I've been performing for years with my acoustic guitar, but I'm ready to take my music to the next level.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I'll be going into the studio the first week of October.  We'll probably be in there for about 2 weeks.  I'm working with a producer named Neilson Hubbard.  He's a great Indie Music producer here in Nashville.   He's worked on two of my favorite records by Nashville artist and Ten out of Tenn member Matthew Perryman Jones.  You can check out his more of his work at <a href=""http://www.neilsonhubbard.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.neilsonhubbard.com</a>.  Neilson will play a significant role in establishing my sound as an artist and I have every confidence in him.  I will also have top-notch studio musicians playing on the record. By the time this project is complete, I'm confident that it will impress.  This is bigger than anything I've previously done with my music and it will be well worth it.  </p>
<p>I have been writing with Neilson and he has connected me with other singer/songwriters to write with as well.  I'm planning on a full-length album of 10 songs.  Once the album is complete, I will use it to show off my talent and capabilities as a marketable artist.  This will be a doorway to many opportunities that will help me build a management team and book shows.  I also have a vast network of people in the music industry that I have been gathering during my years here in Music City, USA.  I will be able to get my music to some crucial ears.  Aside from this network of individuals, I have access to several avenues that can help get my music on TV and Radio.</p>
<p>The budget for the record is about $10,000.  This money will go towards studio time, hiring musicians, and mixing and mastering.  Once everything is done, I will still need funds for album artwork and the manufacturing of the CDs.  I have been saving up money, but I will be counting on fans and friends to help fund this album.  Any contribution you can make will be greatly appreciated.  If you can't make a pledge, you can still help promote my campaign on facebook, twitter, and good old-fashioned word of mouth!</p>
<p>All in all this is very exciting and I would be honored if you were a part of making this possible!</p>

<p>Hey! We're making a music video for the amazing song 'All Bets Are Off,' the lead-off single for the upcoming debut album by Toronto-based alternative pop band Suncapades. Click on the video above -- it's pretty sweeeeeeet. </p>
<p>Being the band's debut album, much of its success is going to hinge on us getting the word out via the lead-off video. 'All Bets Are Off' is a really beautiful, powerful tune, one that needs a video of similar quality. Once it's shot and edited, I'm going to use my publicity background (I've been in publicity for 10 years) to push this song and video internationally and help the band get the accolades I really feel it deserves. Your contributions -- of any amount -- would be AMAZING. </p>
<p>All money raised will cover the following costs: </p>
<ul><ul>
<li>Camera, lighting and assorted equipment rentals</li>
<li>Rehearsal costs and honorarium payments to our video's lead, as well as 40 hula hoopers who'll perform a synchronzed routine at the song's climax. </li>
<li>Wardrobe costs for the video's lead. </li>
<li>Craft services costs for the 40 folks in the video. </li>
<li>Post production special effects. </li>
</ul></ul>

<div> </div>
<div>Below is some info on Suncapades: </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Tim Fisher spent years working toward a music career; even switching career paths to pursue it. Unfortunately, a lifetime of labour and bill payments sidelined his efforts. Now at 40 – an age when most recording artists have closed up shop to rest on their laurels – the multi-instrumentalist is releasing his debut album under the band name Suncapades. 'Everything Darker' features a sound one might not expect from a stocky, working class furniture mover. Written, recorded and produced by Fisher, it’s a layered and richly melodic collection of alternative pop songs about life, death, redemption, rebellion and a yearning for the past. The lead-off single is the melodically anthemic 'All Bets Are Off.' </div>
<div>
<p>The album 'Everything Darker' was written and recorded during a tumultuous period over the past year, where Tim faced various personal challenges, including the illness and eventual passing of his sister. “The difficulty of the past few months was pretty transformative, “Fisher says. “I either had to take a big risk and finally pursue this calling of mine, or abandon the idea once and for all and live with that decision.” Despite much being on the line, Fisher’s expectations for the album are modest. ""I poured my life's savings into these songs,” he laughs, “so if I could get even a couple hundred people to pick up a copy, I'd be over the moon."" And beyond that? “If there’s any interest out there,” he says, “I’d love to take Suncapades on the road and tour these songs.”</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Amy Cunningham, and I am a Canadian singer/songwriter. Singing and playing music has been a big part of my life since I first started to walk and talk. It just comes out of me, and I can't go a day without singing or writing down an idea for a song or a line that strikes me as poetic.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I've been writing since I was 13 (now almost 30! gah), and this past year I finally worked up the courage to do what I have always dreamed...I met an amazing producer named Corwin Fox, saved as much money as I could figure how to save, drained my ""downpayment-on-a-house"" fund, and made my first record. Working with some of the best musicians in BC, it was one of the most moving and exciting experiences of my life. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>With a release date of June 30th, 2011 I moved into my 1999 Dodge Caravan and began an extended 7 month tour that took me all over Canada, the US, and ended in Japan (where I am currently writing this). I have met amazing people, played in beautiful venues, on streets, and at festivals, and now find myself exhausted and ready to hibernate in order to finish writing my next album!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They say that once you are finished recording your first album, you're finally ready to start recording your first album. I've found this to be true :) I learned so much during the first round from so many people and experiences, that I couldn't stop myself from dreaming about the next one while the recording of the first was still taking place.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The challenge becomes funding. Once you've put every last penny you have into the making of your first, and then proceed to travel and perform for 7 months straight, dreams of recording the next album begin to seem quite daunting. With so many ideas, style changes, personal growth, and improvement as a musician from all of those shows, coming up with new material that is fresh sounding doesn't seem to be the issue. Finding a way to make the second album come to fruition does.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So that is where I hope some of you may come in. I don't, in any way, want people to feel pressured to donate. I will say that every penny helps (side note: thank you to those who have fed me and housed me during this past tour!!). Independent artists all over the world are trying to work out a way to do what they love, and I know I'm not the only one out there with a starving artist story (I'm not really that hungry Grandma, don't worry :). If you will consider donating to the recording of my second album, I will be forever grateful. If you choose to show your support in other ways, I am forever grateful. And if it's just bad timing, I very much understand. I can't wait to reach these fundraising goals and begin recording this fall!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>If you've listened to my music and its messages, you may have noticed one thing; it is fairly idealistic and often addresses environmental, philosophic, and sociologic issues. I write about what is in my heart and on my mind, and I find music to be a medium for uniting people and creating a platform for people to come together on issues. Or at least help them feel like they are not alone in their struggles/triumphs/fears. Of course some songs are just about good old fashion love relationships. We all have those too. I've matured a lot over the past few years, and I can't wait to deliver an album that is reflective of continuous grounding and shifting, both within myself and reflecting on the lives of others on this Earth during this time of great change. And I hope it makes you smile, cry, and most of all feel comforted.</div>
<p>I have dreams of linking up with some of my favourite non-profits, promoting sustainable lifestyles, health and wellness, and environmental awareness. All of this will be worked into tour details once the album is released.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To be completely honest, making a great album is EXPENSIVE. Studio time is about 40-50 dollars an hour, and each musician you hire (and they deserve it) is worth about $75 PER song. Times that by minimum 4 musicians per track, and things are already adding up. And a good album takes hours and hours to create. And mix. and master. Producer fees can be at least $2,000. HST. Album art. Producing actual copies of the Album. You get the idea.</p>
<p>That all being said, my budget is flexible. Whatever I have to work with monetarily, I will create an album that is reflective; not in quality but perhaps in instrumentation, or track numbers. Either way, I'll make it work. I am setting a goal of raising 8,000. I'm anticipating matching that out of my own pocket. Any sized donation you can spare is wonderful. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>For anyone who donates $25 or over, you will receive a signed copy of the CD mailed to you upon release, as well as a ticket to the CD release party in the city closest to you. As the increments of donation rise, there will be more thank you gifts added to your package (you will be able to see this on the donation page when you choose what you would like to offer).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mostly, you will get a whole lot of thanks from me. And I hope you enjoy the album once it is finished!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please, let others know about this campaign. Share the link on facebook. Tweet about it. Make a T-shirt with a black marker and some sparkles. Burn copies of my last CD and share it with others (orrrr direct them to Itunes so they can buy it) Any way you can get the word out, I appreciate it!</p>

Finding a way to make the second album come to fruition does.
 
So that is where I hope some of you may come in. I don't, in any way, want people to feel pressured to donate. I will say that every penny helps (side note: thank you to those who have fed me and housed me during this past tour!!). Independent artists all over the world are trying to work out a way to do what they love, and I know I'm not the only one out there with a starving artist story (I'm not really that hungry Grandma, don't worry :). If you will consider donating to the recording of my second album, I will be forever grateful. If you choose to show your support in other ways, I am forever grateful. And if it's just bad timing, I very much understand. I can't wait to reach these fundraising goals and begin recording this fall!
 


The Impact
If you've listened to my music and its messages, you may have noticed one thing; it is fairly idealistic and often addresses environmental, philosophic, and sociologic issues. I write about what is in my heart and on my mind, and I find music to be a medium for uniting people and creating a platform for people to come together on issues. Or at least help them feel like they are not alone in their struggles/triumphs/fears. Of course some songs are just about good old fashion love relationships. We all have those too. I've matured a lot over the past few years, and I can't wait to deliver an album that is reflective of continuous grounding and shifting, both within myself and reflecting on the lives of others on this Earth during this time of great change. And I hope it makes you smile, cry, and most of all feel comforted.
I have dreams of linking up with some of my favourite non-profits, promoting sustainable lifestyles, health and wellness, and environmental awareness. All of this will be worked into tour details once the album is released.


What We Need & What You Get
To be completely honest, making a great album is EXPENSIVE. Studio time is about 40-50 dollars an hour, and each musician you hire (and they deserve it) is worth about $75 PER song. Times that by minimum 4 musicians per track, and things are already adding up. And a good album takes hours and hours to create. And mix. and master. Producer fees can be at least $2,000. HST. Album art. Producing actual copies of the Album. You get the idea.
That all being said, my budget is flexible. Whatever I have to work with monetarily, I will create an album that is reflective; not in quality but perhaps in instrumentation, or track numbers. Either way, I'll make it work. I am setting a goal of raising 8,000. I'm anticipating matching that out of my own pocket. Any sized donation you can spare is wonderful. 
 
For anyone who donates $25 or over, you will receive a signed copy of the CD mailed to you upon release, as well as a ticket to the CD release party in the city closest to you. As the increments of donation rise, there will be more thank you gifts added to your package (you will be able to see this on the donation page when you choose what you would like to offer).
 
Mostly, you will get a whole lot of thanks from me. And I hope you enjoy the album once it is finished!

<h3>Never too old to dream...if given the chance :)</h3>
<p>My dad Joe will be 102 in a few weeks.  My dad is still a vibrant man that enjoys people, watching TV, going for walks (when he can) and just being alive.  His hearing has been suffering lately and it was time to see the doctor about a new hearing device.  My nephew informed me that the devices needed will cost a minimum of just under $5000.00.  The doctor has explained that he noticed that my dad is showing some signs of disassociation.  This means that if we don't get the hearing aids, that part of his brain will die.  And it will just get worse from there.  So I have decided to take this out to the world to ask for help.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The first $5000.00 will go directly to giving my dad his hearing back.  All additional money raised will be used for repair on his manufactured home, a trip to see his only living sibling and for general living expenses to help make the rest of his life more comfortable. If by some miracle we raise enough money to replace his mobile home, he would just be thrilled!  My dad has always been one to donate to charities that help children.  His donations have only been $5.00-$15.00 at a time, but over the years, that adds up.  Now I am asking for the love and respect of others to help one our senior citizens of the world.</p>
Being able to give my dad the gift of hearing back will be huge, for all involved.  Being able to communicate with him again and he not feel so frustration and us not feel like we are yelling at him is HUGE!  He still has a lot to share.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Please share this page with everyone you know.  I cannot begin to thank you enough for your support.  The picture is him at his 100th Birthday. </div>

Please come down Sunday, November 2nd @1pm, in Ross Bay Cemetery to enjoy the live music.</p><p>***********************************</p><p><br/></p><div> </div><p></p><div>I am a classical singer from Victoria, British Columbia. I love the avante garde when it comes to music, and so I have started planning my own concerts that are tailored to my musical interests and personal tastes. </div><div><br/></div><div>This year I am organizing a concert in Ross Bay Cemetery (Victoria, BC). It will be an outdoor concert in the beautiful and historic cemetery, on November 1st and 2nd - All Saints &amp; All Souls Day. I have wanted to do this concert for many years and I have finally put together the permits and the people to be able to pull it off. It isn't easy getting permission to sing a concert in a cemetery around Halloween, so I was extremely fortunate to have the City of Victoria on board with my event! </div><div><br/></div><div>The inspiration behind the concert comes from my reverence and respect for the oft forgotten 2 days after Halloween. All three days (Halloween, All Saints Day, and All Souls Day) make up the time of the year where it is said that the veil is the thinnest between the worlds of the living and the dead. It is said that our ancestors are closer to us during these 3 days, and there are many traditions around the world honouring those who have passed. Especially in Europe, this time of year is very special, a time when we hold our loved ones close, whether living or deceased. This time of year also coincides with my birthday, November 1st. For the past few years it has been a personal tradition for me to go down to the Ross Bay Cemetery on my birthday or Nov 2nd and sing a very quiet song titled ""Allerseelen"" or in English, All Souls Day. This German song by Richard Strauss is a gorgeous bittersweet song speaking of love that still lives on in the heart of someone who has lost their partner. I go there to sing amongst the quietude of the cemetery, a song for those who are laid to rest. I have always thought it would be a wonderful idea to sing a concert there for the community, to honour those who can only be there in spirit.  The concerts will be encompassing repertoire from the classical art song genre on the topic of All Souls Day, and will include works by R. Strauss, Brahms, Schubert, and more.</div><div><br/></div><div> I will be accompanied by a small string ensemble, made up of professional musicians from various orchestras on the island. The music will be arranged for strings by a music arranger and will be tailored to the instruments and my voice.  I am employing professional musicians to play for this concert and therefore need to be able to pay them. I believe that musicians should be paid fairly for their art, but there are so many times when this just does not happen. This is why I need YOU to help us out to make this oncert happen!</div><div><br/></div><div>There is also the challenge that the permit I have obtained for the concert restricts the ability to accept donations at the time of this event. I cannot sell tickets nor take cash donations at the site. I love that this concert is free and open to the public, and wouldnt have it any other way, but I also am limited on my own funds, and am having trouble coming up with the money I need to put on this concert. So far I have paid out of my own pocket for the expenses.  I am putting my own time and money into my dream of having this recital, in order to give people the gift of music in such a special and sacred space.</div><div><br/></div><div> This is why I have created this crowdfunding campaign - I need help covering the costs of putting on a fabulous recital for the enjoyment of our community!</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><p></p><div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>What we need: For this concert I will need 4+ instrumentalists for accompanying my voice. I would like to pay each player $300 (for rehearsal time + 2 concerts), totaling in $1200. I also need to hire a music arranger to convert the music to an instrumental accompaniment. I would like to pay him $200. I also need to purchase promotional materials to advertise the concert. This will cost $100. The permit and other costs associated with equipment/rental costs are approx. $100. Luckily I have already secured in-kind support for much of the equipment necessary as well as rehearsal space. In order to just break even, I would need these costs covered as well.</p>
<p>***UPDATE - Through sheer luck I have now arranged my schedule so that I no longer am missing work to perform in the concert, so the amount needed is actually a bit less now! yay! I will be donating my services as a musician and only wish to pay my performers, and pay for the associated costs to organize such an event. Booyah!***</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If we raise over the amount of $2000, the extra will be distributed equally among the performers.</p>
<p>All donations are gratefully accepted and appreciated. This is an opportunity to support the arts and show our community that music is an essential part of our culture and our lives!</p>

Please come down Sunday, November 2nd @1pm, in Ross Bay Cemetery to enjoy the live music.*********************************** I am a classical singer from Victoria, British Columbia. I love the avante garde when it comes to music, and so I have started planning my own concerts that are tailored to my musical interests and personal tastes. This year I am organizing a concert in Ross Bay Cemetery (Victoria, BC). It will be an outdoor concert in the beautiful and historic cemetery, on November 1st and 2nd - All Saints & All Souls Day. I have wanted to do this concert for many years and I have finally put together the permits and the people to be able to pull it off. It isn't easy getting permission to sing a concert in a cemetery around Halloween, so I was extremely fortunate to have the City of Victoria on board with my event! The inspiration behind the concert comes from my reverence and respect for the oft forgotten 2 days after Halloween. All three days (Halloween, All Saints Day, and All Souls Day) make up the time of the year where it is said that the veil is the thinnest between the worlds of the living and the dead. It is said that our ancestors are closer to us during these 3 days, and there are many traditions around the world honouring those who have passed. Especially in Europe, this time of year is very special, a time when we hold our loved ones close, whether living or deceased. This time of year also coincides with my birthday, November 1st. For the past few years it has been a personal tradition for me to go down to the Ross Bay Cemetery on my birthday or Nov 2nd and sing a very quiet song titled ""Allerseelen"" or in English, All Souls Day. This German song by Richard Strauss is a gorgeous bittersweet song speaking of love that still lives on in the heart of someone who has lost their partner. I go there to sing amongst the quietude of the cemetery, a song for those who are laid to rest. I have always thought it would be a wonderful idea to sing a concert there for the community, to honour those who can only be there in spirit.  The concerts will be encompassing repertoire from the classical art song genre on the topic of All Souls Day, and will include works by R. Strauss, Brahms, Schubert, and more. I will be accompanied by a small string ensemble, made up of professional musicians from various orchestras on the island. The music will be arranged for strings by a music arranger and will be tailored to the instruments and my voice.  I am employing professional musicians to play for this concert and therefore need to be able to pay them. I believe that musicians should be paid fairly for their art, but there are so many times when this just does not happen. This is why I need YOU to help us out to make this oncert happen!There is also the challenge that the permit I have obtained for the concert restricts the ability to accept donations at the time of this event. I cannot sell tickets nor take cash donations at the site. I love that this concert is free and open to the public, and wouldnt have it any other way, but I also am limited on my own funds, and am having trouble coming up with the money I need to put on this concert. So far I have paid out of my own pocket for the expenses.  I am putting my own time and money into my dream of having this recital, in order to give people the gift of music in such a special and sacred space. This is why I have created this crowdfunding campaign - I need help covering the costs of putting on a fabulous recital for the enjoyment of our community!   What We Need & What You Get What we need: For this concert I will need 4+ instrumentalists for accompanying my voice. I would like to pay each player $300 (for rehearsal time + 2 concerts), totaling in $1200. I also need to hire a music arranger to convert the music to an instrumental accompaniment. I would like to pay him $200. I also need to purchase promotional materials to advertise the concert. This will cost $100. The permit and other costs associated with equipment/rental costs are approx. $100. Luckily I have already secured in-kind support for much of the equipment necessary as well as rehearsal space. In order to just break even, I would need these costs covered as well.
***UPDATE - Through sheer luck I have now arranged my schedule so that I no longer am missing work to perform in the concert, so the amount needed is actually a bit less now! yay! I will be donating my services as a musician and only wish to pay my performers, and pay for the associated costs to organize such an event. Booyah!***

If we raise over the amount of $2000, the extra will be distributed equally among the performers.
All donations are gratefully accepted and appreciated. This is an opportunity to support the arts and show our community that music is an essential part of our culture and our lives!
What you get: 
1. If you live in Victoria British Columbia, you get to come down to the  concert and enjoy the music! 
***Nov 2nd, 1-2pm, Ross Bay Cemetery (1516 Fairfield Rd), at the main cement path convergence across from the Thrifty Foods Plaza. Bring warm clothes. There will be limited seating for those who need it, and standing room is encouraged.***

2. AND: If you were to help sponsor this event by donating before Oct 21st , your name would be listed in the concert programme as a donor!
Why this is important:


I believe this is
an important concert to have because it will  provide a valuable weekend of music and
culture to the beautiful Fairfield community of Victoria. It is a rarity to even get a permit for Ross Bay Cemetery, and so this
is a real opportunity to produce a truly special concert.

Tournee auf die Beine gestellt zu haben.  Zum ersten Mal werden wir außerhalb
Europas auf Tour gehen. Wir können es kaum erwarten unsere Musik zu teilen,
neue Bekanntschaften zu machen, neue Kollaboration einzugehen und in eine neue
Kultur einzutauchen.


Wir werdem die Schönheit anzapfen um etwas Neues zu erschaffen. Etwas
Einzigartiges soll es sein. Ein Livealbum am Strand aufgenommen um das Gefühl
und die Atmosphäre einzufangen. Die nächsten Monate sind ideal um aus unseren
Gewohnheiten auszutreten und neue Brücken zu nutzen um die Klüfte dieser Welt
zu überwinden.

In der Isolation entstehen keine neuen
Verknüpfungen deswegen sind wir entschlossen unsere Liebe an
allen Orten, die wir anpeilen zu verbreiten. Wir bitten euch daher demütig
uns zu unterstützen und unser Vorhaben Realität werden zu lassen.






Wir sind stolz bis hierher gekommen zu sein und das unabhängig und
eigenbestimmt ohne Label und wir werden auch weiterhin mit all unserer Leidenschaft weiterkämpfen. 

Die Kraft der
Kommunikation bestimmt unseren Glauben und die Liebenden der Musik
zusammenzuführen um ein Album zu schaffen, welches die positiven Energien in
ihrer Vielfalt und Originalität verströmt. 
Nach unseren
zusammenfassenden Berechnungen benötigen   wir zur Realisierung der Aufnahme und Produktion des Albums. Alles was darüber hinaus vorhanden sein sollte, werden wir in die Verbreitung und Veröffentlichung investieren.
In dem Geiste alle zu beteiligen und Spaß zu haben, haben wir uns die folgenden Entschädigungen einfallen lassen. Diese beinhalten einen Beat-Box Unterricht,Sommersaison Festivaltickets, Wohnzimmerkonzerte,  Campingausflüge, eine Dinner Party und viel Andere! Das Album wird außerdem zur Vorbestellung erwerblich sein. Das erste vollständige Album und euch, unsere Freunde, Familie und Fans als Teil davon zu haben, ist unbezahlbar. Ran an die Bouletten!





Zusammen können wir die Kräfte der Kreativität entfesseln!",17.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>The Miles Davis
Memorial Committee of <a href=""http://www.visitalton.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Alton, Illinois</a> invites you to be part of the creation of
a bronze statue of Miles Davis in the town of his birth. Alton is located
on the Mississippi River, just 20 miles north of St. Louis, in a beautiful
tourist area and entertainment district.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>So What’s the Big Deal?</b></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.milesdavis.com/us/home"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Miles Davis</a>
is regarded as one of the most innovative, influential and respected figures in
the history of music.  He has been described as “one of the great
innovators in jazz.”<em>  The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp;
Roll</em> noted ""Miles Davis played a crucial and inevitably controversial
role in every major development in jazz since the mid-'40s, and no other jazz
musician has had such a profound effect on rock. Miles Davis was the most
widely recognized jazz musician of his era, an outspoken social critic and an
arbiter of style—in attitude and fashion—as well as music.”</p>
<p>With his
world renown, you would think there would be a public monument to him in his
own country! Nope. There is a statue in France and also in Poland but nothing
in the United States. In a country full of streets lined with statues and monuments
for the well-known to the little-known, this icon of evolutionary music has
been overlooked. </p>
<p><strong>So What’s the Plan?</strong></p>
<p>A bronze statue
will be commissioned and then created by <a href=""http://www.prestonjacksonart.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Preston Jackson</a>, professor emeritus of
the Art Institute of Chicago . Preston is not only a prolific sculptor<strong> but is a
jazz musician, as well</strong>. Through his talents and skills he will represent Miles
in a way that will not only feature the man but also his music. </p>
<p>The entire
project from the sculpture itself to the site preparation and landscaping will
cost $100,000. The modest goal we have for this indiegogo project is to raise enough to get our

artist, Preston
Jackson, started on the sculpture.
At this time, we are nearly halfway
there. However, we still have a long way to go. It’s time to open up this
opportunity and involve  the greater community of Miles Davis fans. We
want everyone to have the opportunity to pay tribute to the legacy of Miles
Davis in a tangible way. Be part of bringing Miles back to his birthplace.</p>
