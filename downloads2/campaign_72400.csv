<p>The 43
Lions Clubs of central and southern Virginia have formed The Virginia Lions
District 24-B Mobile Health Unit Committee, Inc.  The mission of this
organization is to provide free vision and hearing screenings to children and
adults in our region.</p>
<p><b>Why do we need a Mobile Health Unit?
</b></p>
<ul>
<li>25% of children have some
     type of vision problem</li>
<li>Some eye disorders, if left
     untreated can cause loss of vision in the effected eye</li>
<li>Eye charts that are typically
     used in schools and doctor's offices are best for detecting
     near-sightedness.  They often fail to detect other eye
     disorders.  </li>
<li>70% of juvenile delinquents
     have an undiagnosed vision problem</li>
<li>Undiagnosed vision
     problems cause children to have trouble learning to read, they
     subsequently fall behind in school and this often leads to behavioral
     problems and even criminal activity.  </li>
<li>Central and Southern Virginia
     have a high rate of uninsured people, poverty and unemployment. 
     Therefore families are less likely to visit eye doctors than families in
     other regions.  </li>
<li>There are currently 4 mobile
     health units operated by Lions Clubs in Virginia.  These vehicles are
     on the road approximately 200 days per year and they screen over 30,000
     people annually! </li>
</ul>
<p><b>What does it cost to get this
vehicle on the road?</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The total cost of a brand new
     fully customized bus with all of the vision and hearing testing equipment
     is $120,000.</li>
<li>Our organization has raised
     $15,000 so far and our goal for this campaign is $15,000.</li>
<li>Once we reach our goal, we
     will be apply to get matching grants from the Lions of Virginia
     Foundation, the Lions Clubs International Foundation and other

</div><h3></h3><p><b>Who Are We?</b></p>
<p>My name is
Grahame Russell, for over 20 years director of Rights Action.  As part of this work, I have worked
extensively in Mayan Q’eqchi’ communities of eastern Guatemala that, for
decades, have suffered repression and violent evictions caused by
Canadian mining companies: INCO, Skye Resources and Hudbay Minerals.</p>
<p>This
campaign is to raise funds for the on-going health and wheelchair needs of a
young Q’eqchi’ man, German Chub.</p>
<p><b>German Chub Choc, Victim of
Hudbay Minerals</b></p>
<p>Of all the
victims of Hudbay Minerals’ violent attempt (2008-2011) to operate a nickel
mine in the Q’eqchi’ territories of eastern Guatemala, the on-going
health situation of German Chub – paralyzed from the chest down; loss of use of
one lung; wheel-chair bound; a bullet still in his body, close to his spinal
column – is the most pressing.</p>
<p>On September
27, 2009, German Chub, a young man and father of one, was shot by
Mynor Padilla, a former Colonel in the Guatemalan Army and head of security for
Hudbay Minerals in Guatemala.  That same
day, Mynor Padilla was also responsible for the murder of
Adolfo Ich, a community leader, father of five and teacher.</p>
<p>Since that
time, German – along with other victims – has been involved in struggles for justice, in a criminal case in Guatemala against
Mynor Padilla, and in civil lawsuits in Canada against Hudbay Minerals. (More
information about lawsuits in Canada: <a href=""http://www.chocversushudbay.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.chocversushudbay.com</a>;

German and the Mayan Q’eqchi’ people for their lands and justice. (Trailer: <a href=""http://www.defensorathefilm.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.defensorathefilm.com</a>)
</p>
<p>Since being
shot, and left for dead, German struggles mightily, on a daily-weekly basis, to survive and provide for his child and aging parents.  The bullet that left German paralyzed from
the chest down, also pierced and damaged one of his lungs and
remains lodged precariously close to his spinal column.</p><p>Given his now permanently vulnerable
condition, German regularly falls very ill; he has constant expenses to buy
supplies (catheters, gloves, pills, etc) just to get through a healthy day; he
has regular expenses to buy replacement parts for his wheelchair, living as he
does in an utterly non-wheelchair friendly environment; he needs regular
medical check-ups to xray his spinal column to see if the position
of the bullet is shifting. </p>
<p>As German
continues with his struggle for justice in Canada and Guatemala, and fair
compensation, please help Rights Action raise $7,500 that will provide one
year’s worth of health supplies and spare parts for his wheelchair.</p>
<p>This support
will not resolve German’s underlying life-long challenges, now that he is
wheelchair bound, but it will enable him to get on with his life, with son,
wife and parents, while we continue with the broader struggles for justice and
proper compensation. </p>
<p>For more
information about this, and other mining-related struggles, contact
Grahame at Rights Action.  We are
involved in half-a-dozen mining related struggles, and there have been many
killings, gang-rapes, forced evictions, and other repression.  I would gladly send you more information
about all this.</p><p>At this point in time,
because of the nature of his injuries and condition, German’s needs are the
most pressing.</p>

That dream takes baby steps and I've already begun that journey. I am currently renting a spa space from a friend in an office building with 5 other people. I would love to expand this dream and rent out the space caddy corner to this current location. It would be absolutely perfect for estheticians. My own space to come and go as I please around my own schedule. The rent for the place is $450/month and if I can raise enough funds to rent for the next year, then I can worry only about income for my home and building clientele. I can't currently afford my home + bills with my career needing rent as well. I have been an esthetician for 8 years and after the sudden and unexpected loss of my job, I feel like now is the perfect time to branch out on my own. As a single mother raising a little girl, it is very important to me to have a flexible schedule. I love being able to work my job around my family life and not family life around my job. I have dreams bigger than this space but I need to begin somewhere. I have already invested in new waxing supplies, facial product for my back bar, among other things needed to run a spa. I am looking at getting a better facial machine, hot towel cabby, table, and more product for a better variety. This all takes money and at the moment, that is running thin. If given this financial help, I'll be able to get Flawless Skin Care up and running, providing another small business to my community, and helping other estheticians to branch out on their own as well. This would secure the future of my business for the next year. No fear in not coming up with the rent to continue as it will be paid in full. The best thing about this campaign is that you're donating and getting something in return. The majority of the options here provide you with a relaxing service of your own. Come and see what we're all about! Tell your friends. Spread the word. Donate to a great cause and enjoy an awesome spa service.</p>
<p><b>How Much I Need</b></p>
<p>I am looking to raise $5,000. I want the lease to match that of the massage space that is currently paid through October. So, $4,950 is needed to pay the rent in full and the other $50 would be used to put a door up to divide the space. If I don't reach that goal than any money received will go directly into the spa. Whether it be providing more product or updating our machinery. It will all go towards making the space that much better for you; our client and supporter. </p>

<b>Kristof</b>. I am a Hungarian <b>student</b>. I study <b>economics</b>. 
<p>To cover my
living expenses I started to work as a <b>rickshaw driver</b>. I like doing it.
Anyway my hobby is cycling. </p>
<p>But what I
like the most in it, is that I make people happy. They get on the rickshaw and
smile. </p>
<p>Budapest is
a lovely city in the heart of Europe. Very rich in history, architecture and
culture. And people make it live, they shop in the market halls, sit around in cafes and restaurants, and go out to pubs and nightclubs. I like sharing this spirit with my clients. I tell them about the places, not
only basic things, but stories that make the city what it is. And I'm happy
they enjoy it.</p>
<p><b>At the
moment I rent the rickshaw weekly. A weekly rental fee is about 80-100 USD</b>
(depends on season) that takes great part of what I earn away from me. <br/>
<b>I wish I had my own rickshaw</b> and did not have to pay these high expenses just to be
able to work what I like.<br/>
<br/>
<b>I would politely ask you to contribute to my own rickshaw.</b> With this generous
deed you would not only help me to get rid of the disproportionately high
rental expenses, but you would also make my dream come true.<br/>
To have my own rickshaw a thing that its owner can love as a cyclist loves
his/her bike.<br/>
And with this, which is the <b>most important</b>, I would become <b>independent and
free</b>.<br/>I would be able to make
a living by an activity</p><ul>
<li> I <b>like</b>
</li>
<li>the <b>clients enjoy</b>
</li>
<li>fully
<b>flexible</b> and <b>compatible</b> with my studies.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>In return</b> I
offer free <b>rickshaw rides</b>, <b>sightseeing tours</b>, <b>shopping afternoons</b> and <b>pub
crawls</b>.<br/>
Those, who cannot come to Budapest will receive a special rickshaw <b>sightseeing video</b>
recorded in first person mode very similar to a real rickshaw experience.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Please support and enjoy the perks!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.</b><br/></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><div> <p>1500$ is an approximate market price of a used, working rickshaw.<br/>The funding is flexible.

Kristof. I am a Hungarian student. I study economics. 
To cover my
living expenses I started to work as a rickshaw driver. I like doing it.
Anyway my hobby is cycling. 
But what I
like the most in it, is that I make people happy. They get on the rickshaw and
smile. 
Budapest is
a lovely city in the heart of Europe. Very rich in history, architecture and
culture. And people make it live, they shop in the market halls, sit around in cafes and restaurants, and go out to pubs and nightclubs. I like sharing this spirit with my clients. I tell them about the places, not
only basic things, but stories that make the city what it is. And I'm happy
they enjoy it.
At the
moment I rent the rickshaw weekly. A weekly rental fee is about 80-100 USD
(depends on season) that takes great part of what I earn away from me. 
I wish I had my own rickshaw and did not have to pay these high expenses just to be
able to work what I like.

I would politely ask you to contribute to my own rickshaw. With this generous
deed you would not only help me to get rid of the disproportionately high
rental expenses, but you would also make my dream come true.
To have my own rickshaw a thing that its owner can love as a cyclist loves
his/her bike.
And with this, which is the most important, I would become independent and
free.I would be able to make
a living by an activity
 I like

the clients enjoy

fully
flexible and compatible with my studies.

In return I
offer free rickshaw rides, sightseeing tours, shopping afternoons and pub
crawls.
Those, who cannot come to Budapest will receive a special rickshaw sightseeing video
recorded in first person mode very similar to a real rickshaw experience.

Please support and enjoy the perks!

Thank you.
What We Need & What You Get 1500$ is an approximate market price of a used, working rickshaw.The funding is flexible. The quality of my own rickshaw depends on how much I receive.I will keep you up to date with the process of buying and refurbishing or building my own rickshaw.The perks are fully feasible without reaching the target, as I can take you on a ride with the current rented rickshaw as well. I hope I will with my own! :D
All my backers will receive a thank you letter.Those, who contribute 10$ or more will receive the first person sightseeing video we will shoot in spring.Do not hesitate to contribute more even if you cannot come to Budapest in the near future or at all. You will receive the video and the perk you buy is valid for years, any time you decide to come. You can also assign your perk to anyone. Even to local children or families. They will enjoy it! And you will receive a short video about their experience. We'll get in contact and discuss everything. :D

<h2>South African Wine Farms</h2>
<p>Did you know there's a difference between wineries in the United States and wine farms in South Africa? While wineries in America tend to be mass-mechanized production businesses, wine farms in South Africa are communities in which most employees and their families live and work together. Wine farm owners care for the well-being of those in their communities and often provide or contribute towards housing and education for the workers and their families. The wines they produce through traditional, hands-on methods, such as hand-picking and hand-sorting, are literally the production of a community. South African wines are some of the finest in the world, as proven by the many top awards given each year by international wine competitions.<br/></p>

<p>La Peña has thrived for 40 years serving youth and adults in Berkeley, Oakland, and surrounding cities, with roots arts and social justice programing.  La Peña was started by a group of Latin and
North Americans as a response to the military coup in Chile that overthrew the
elected government of Salvador Allende on September 11, 1973. We opened our
doors in June 1975 and have been developing ever since. Today our focus is on
supporting new 21<sup>st</sup> century cohorts of leaders in arts
activism and social justice projects in one of the most diverse metropolitan
areas in the United States. Our goals are to encourage creativity, promote community
dialogue, share knowledge, and build capacity for social transformation. La
Peña’s educational philosophy stems from the cultural and political traditions
of its founding: interconnectedness among cultures, cooperative efforts,
innovation of new arts expressions, and solidarity for the creation of a just
society.  Our distinctive programming brings
together community leaders, activists, and educators, as well as teaching
artists, and professional and student musicians, dancers, poets and muralists
to participate in indigenous roots art forms from the Americas and the African
diaspora.  All of our work promotes egalitarian
and collective practices.

environmental justice, militarization, women’s movements, and labor issues. We
are intergenerational, often relying on accounts of historical witnesses to

Loren est une gestionnaire accomplie avec plus de 10 ans d'expérience dans le commerce du détail. Elle raffole des interactions sociales et de l'entrepreneuriat. C'est donc avec confiance qu'elle réussit à mener les gens à atteindre leur potentiel dans leur milieu de travail et ce, en travaillant ensemble afin de rejoindre les objectifs de l'entreprise. Elle est passionnée par sa communauté et s'y investit régulièrement. Les valeurs de Loren listées ci-dessous sont la fondation du concept:
responsabilité écologique
promouvoir l'estime de soi
promouvoir des habitudes saines
soutenir des entreprises localEd
collaborer avec des organismes communautaires
Loren is an accomplished retail director with over 10 years experience in the industry. She craves social interaction and entrepreneurship, and is passionate about her community-- regularly investing her skills and ideas in various community-based projects. It is with confidence that she leads people to reach their potential in the workplace, working together to achieve business objectives. The businesses' values listed below form the foundation of the concept:


ecological responsibility

promotion of self-esteem

promotion of healthy habits

support of local businesses

collaboration with community organizations

LA/THE MISSION
Cette campagne de financement vous permet de faire partie de la phase d'agrandissement du magasin. Le nouveau local permet un espace pour les ateliers créatifs, un plus grand espace pour manger sur place, dans un voisinage plus accessible, et d'autres belles surprises qui seront dévoilées sous peu.

This fundraising campaign lets you be part of the stores' expansion phase. The new location provides space for creative workshops, a larger space to eat in, is situated in a more accessible neighborhood, and other exciting surprises to be unveiled shortly.
             
           LES BESOINS ET LES RÉCOMPENSES/ THE NEEDS AND THE PERKS 
Il nous faut 7500$ divisé comme suit:



Nouveaux permis MAPAQ et d'occupation 

Écocertifcation de l'entreprise

Des rénovations (on continue avec l'esprit éco!)

Le déménagement

L'acquisition de nouveautés  (The Itsy-Bitsy Yarn Store, Gabriel cosmetics, Zuzu, Brow Gal, Lippy Girl, Zen, Rawesome et des cupcakes véganes!)



 $ 7,500 is divided as follows:



 New permits MAPAQ and occupancy


Renovations (continue with the eco spirit!)


The big move


The acquisition of new products (The Itsy Bitsy - Yarn Store, Gabriel cosmetics, Zuzu, Brow Gal, Lippy Girl Zen Rawesome and vegan cupcakes!)






L'idée est de faire une pré-vente de bons d'achats qui seront échangeables en magasin. Par exemple, si vous achetez pour 50$, vous recevrez un bon d'achat de 50$ applicable sur n'importe quel produit en boutique. Ainsi que des forfaits méli-mélos. Par exemple, si vous achetez pour 50$, vous recevez un bon d'achat de 25$ applicable sur n'importe quel produit en magasin et un laissez-passez pour un atelier créatif.

The idea is to pre-sell  gift card vouchers to be redeemed in store. For example, if you buy $50, you will receive a gift card voucher for $50 applicable on any item in store. And the mix'n'match packages would work like the following example: if you buy $50, you receive a gift card voucher for $25 applicable on any product in the store and a ticket for a creative workshop.

**LES ATELIERS CRÉATIFS/ THE CREATIVE WORKSHOPS:



Fabrication de masque capillaire, d' exfoliant pour le corps et de baume à lèvres. 


Creation of hair masks, body scrubs and lip balms.


Atelier inspiré Pintesrest (DIY)


Pinterest inspired workshop (DIY)


Séance d'intro au tricot (The Itsy-Bitsy Yarn Store)


Intro knitting class (The Itsy-Bitsy Yarn Store)


Session d'intro à l'aromathérapie


Intro to aromatherapy session 


Session d'intro aux huiles essentiellles


Essential oils intro session


Fabrication de savon


Soap making workshop


ET BEAUCOUP D'AUTRES!!!
AND MANY MORE!!!

Nous communiquerons la date de notre ouverture officielle et notre emplacement dans le quartier Notre-Dame-de-Grâce sur notre page Facebook et par courriel. Vous serez donc informés de tous les détails.
We will communicate the date of our Grand Opening and our new location in the Notre -Dame-de -Grâce neighbourhood  on our Facebook page and through email. You will be informed of all the details as we proceed.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Chris Ross and I'm building Macomb County's first axe-throwing range, Total Axe. Axe-throwing has become increasingly popular lately and I want to bring this new sport to Clinton Township. I have nearly 10 years experience throwing axes and teaching others to throw. I want to make this activity more accessible, fun, innovative and safe for everyone involved. Total Axe will offer new games, new targets and a more dynamic experience.</p>
<h3>About Total Axe</h3>
<p>Total Axe is an indoor axe throwing facility. We have leased a 3,000 square-foot facility in Clinton Township. Doors will open by November 1 and <a href=""https://totalaxe.checkfront.com/reserve/?D=20181101"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the booking page is already open</a> to reserve your party. During your 2-hour reservation, axe coaches will teach everyone about safety, teach everyone how to throw an axe, then facilitate a tournament for bragging rights! </p>
<p><a href=""https://totalaxe.checkfront.com/reserve/?category_id=4&amp;D=20181107"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">League nights are available</a> Sunday-Thursday. Each league runs 8 weeks, culminating in a championship tournament. During the first 7 weeks, each player will get to warm up, then play 4 matches against other participants.</p>
<p>We don't serve food, but you are allowed to bring your own. You can even have catering brought in for your event.</p>
<h3>Safety</h3>
<p>At Total Axe, safety is the primary goal. For this reason, you must be over 18 to enter (with closed-toe shoes) and we do not serve alcohol. Anyone who appears intoxicated or acts in an unsafe manner will be asked to leave.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>All of the funding received will be put to use in the facility. We are building a batting-cage layout so that each thrower is enclosed by fencing, isolating axes from spectators as well as other participants to make the experience as safe as possible.</p>
<p>We need some additional funding for seating for spectators. Depending on your support, we would like to add other throwing games like darts and cornhole. Beyond that, additional supplies will be used to design new targets for games like Tic-Tac-Toe, Cricket, other dart games, and Sequence.</p>
<p>Small donations will receive a t-shirt or gift card on opening day. Larger donations will receive their donation plus a bonus as a gift card on opening day.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Total Axe wants to bring this game to as many people as possible. We plan to be open six days a week, offering leagues four of those nights. We will offer team-building events tailored specifically to your group. When there is open space, walk-in throwing will be available to everyone over 18. Our goal is to offer more fun and more safety at a lower cost than other facilities.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Bia Don Dia is Gaelic for 'Food for the God'. We are a postpartum meal delivery and placenta encapsulation service. Serving families in San Francisco and the surrounding Bay Area.</p>
<p>'Bia Don Dia was created for all birthing folk. It is here to play an important role in our community, supporting the birthing person &amp; their family during the early weeks of postpartum, a time so magical yet very challenging.'</p>
<p>Once the baby is born the mother is extremely hypersensitive to the environment around them. Whilst your body heals, it is vital that you are properly nourished with warm healing foods, elixirs, and herbs to aid in your recovery. The level of care you receive during this time will impact your health and wellbeing for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>We have carefully put together traditional postpartum meals, elixirs and herbal teas packed with the nourishment &amp; nutrition your body needs to heal during this period. The ingredients serve to replenish lost nutrients, aid in milk production, calm the nervous system, and restore energy and warmth to the body after your labour &amp; delivery. We source organic, non-GMO and locally sourced fresh food. Prepared from the day you give birth and delivered right to your door. </p>
<p>We simply wish to care for the new parent so they can care for their baby and enjoy the magical first weeks welcoming them into the world. Help us bring this vision to fruition.

</div><div>
<p>For many families today in modern society, they no longer live with or close by to extended family members. This can be challenging especially when you are welcoming a new baby into the world. In many cultures traditionally the mother was kept indoors and catered to intently for this sacred time. Allowing her to heal, recover, bond, and welcome her new child. Sadly today this level of support is viewed as a complete luxury. Bia Don Dia is here to plan an important role in our community. Supporting the person &amp; their family during the early weeks of postpartum.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>If we don't meet our goal things could take a little longer to complete as we will have to get the funding elsewhere. ie August could become September. Either way, this is happening and we are very excited!</p>

<li>My name is Darius Smith. I am an engineer by education and an IT consultant by trade because I love dealing with people and business. I have worked for startups and I have done other entrepreneurial ventures previous to the Bark Park, but this is by far the most beneficial work I’ve done for a community.</li>
<li>I recently moved to Indianapolis from Las Vegas in late 2017. My doberman ‘King’ was used to warm weather 75% of the year and our cold months had no snow. As my wife and I got used to changes in the climate we had to help King adjust. We searched for a way to allow him to play and run in the winter time, but nothing fit our needs exactly how we expected. We made it through that winter, but this year I’ve dedicated time to finding a solution for our new city. We plan to have the first Indoor location for dogs all over Indy to come this winter and to continue to come all year around.</li>
<li>There are over 2 million people living in metro Indianapolis and surrounding areas and it is estimated that over 35% of us have dogs as pets. That means out of the 700,000 dog owners in town I am probably not the only one who has come across this problem. Based on the response I’ve gotten in the short amount of time, there are a lot of locals who are extremely excited to see us open our doors to the Indy pet community. We are going to be a place that makes a difference this year.</li>
</ul><h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3><ul>
<li>The benefit of supporting us early is that you will get to come and play but at a discounted price. Prices during the crowdfunding will be 20%-50% less than post launch prices.</li>
<li>Certain perks will also be come with other dog product gifts from other local business partners. For example some of our partners include: Paws and Play Dog Resort, Pet Wants Indy, Three Dog Bakery Indy, City Dog Grocery and many more. With each membership option,  you get at least one or more free gifts from of our local partners.</li>
<li>Lastly we plan to invite many of our backers to our VIP Grand Opening Party where you will be able to experience The Bark Park first before it is open with all of the other backers in the community.</li>
<li>We need $15,000 in upfront funding and here is why. We have found the perfect location! It is right across the street from the Castleton Square Mall at 5601 E. 82nd Street. The building is mostly ready for us, but the two things we have to upgrade:</li>
</ul><ol>
<li>Clean and texturize the floors indoor to ensure that we all have a safe and sanitary place to play.</li>
<li>We need to build a restroom inside so that the only potty mistakes are made by our four-legged friends.</li>
<li>In addition to fixing up our building, we have:</li>
</ol><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">- a downpayment for our lease.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">- Insurance to make sure any accident is covered</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">- Decorations to make your new hangout look impressive</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">- And of course the equipment and toys! We plan to have a lot of activities available</p><h3>The Difference</h3><ul>
<li>When I tell the story of why Indy’s Indoor Bark Park came to me, a lot of people tell me this business already exists and go on to mention the doggy daycare they take their dog to. This is the biggest hurdle people have when it comes to understanding our Indoor Bark Park. It is NOT a daycare where you drop off your dog and come back at a later time. We are a community-like destination for you come in and play along with your dog and everyone else’s dog as well. We are a place you can go and find great products and information dog lovers love to share. We are a place to go to enjoy and afternoon, evening or weekend. And we are the place you go to throw your dog a birthday party!</li>
<li>We already have the stamp of approval from many of the local businesses you already know and love. We have a location that is accessible for so many Indy dog parents. We have the logistics worked out for you to be able to come and enjoy more than just our dog park services but also the community of dog loving people.</li>
</ul><h3>Challenges</h3><ul><li>Challenge 1: We know people will come to visit the Bark Park in the peak of the summer and winter but we think attendance will be less incentivized in the spring and fall when there is less extreme weather.</li></ul><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Our solution for this challenge is to continue to grow year around and bring more and more value so that the Bark Park is not just a seasonal destination but a part of the community that people go to because your dogs don’t want to be anywhere else. When it is nice out, we will bring other human amenities such as craft beer, food trucks, TV's with live sports etc...  In other words you will have a list of reasons to come in addition to it being your dog's favorite place.</p><ul><li>Challenge 2: Location.</li></ul><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We know people from all over Indianapolis and all of its suburbs will want the Bark Park to be in the neighborhood. Our main goal was to make sure we are located inside of the circle. We did the best we could to try to put it near many of the people who have been early supporters with the thought that they are a small sample size of who will eventually be our clientele. The location is near many highly populated areas of the city people enjoy. It is also near a 465 freeway exit so it is accessible to the entire town.</p><ul><li>Challenge 3: Size of building.</li></ul><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We want there to be unlimited space for dogs to run as they have at an outdoor dog park. While that would be ideal, inside is a bit more challenging. Right now we are going to be leasing about 4,000sf of a facility. If we grow at the rate we expect, we should be able to max out the entire facility which will be more than double the space. This is solely dependent on how many dogs we continuously have visiting. There is a conjoined space next to our space that we plan to hopefully occupy because we've grown so large so fast. If we have enough dogs we will be able to rent both spaces and have an abundance of running and playing room. While we are still a small and new business we will rent what we can afford which is still a lot of space.</p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><ul>
<li>Spread the word! We are new to Indianapolis so only a small percentage of people know we are starting this so far. We want every dog parent in town to know our name. You can tell a friend to tell a friend. You can invite people to visit us. You can come yourself and take pictures and post to your social media page.</li>

<p>Matt here! <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/toomanyrecords"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Too Many Records</a>, formerly known as Damnit Sandy, has been a YouTube channel since 2015. The content was mostly me sharing my growing and morphing collection of records in the form of rarities, recommendations and oddities across all genres and eras. I also try to make videos showing off record stores as often as possible, because they are cultural institutions that don't get enough love. </p>
<p>Since the inception of “Too Many Records,” the channel has steadily grown to over 40,000 subscribers, and I have continued to branch out in many exciting ways. I started a record label, where I was able to help artists I love and believe in get their music on vinyl whereas they may not have been able to otherwise. We've sold out 12 releases in the span of two years. I also threw “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVb8u5t-2Ek"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Too Many Records Fest</a>” (highlight reel linked) in March of 2019 in Los Angeles where I had 3 bands play, a live podcast, and ran a pop up shop selling 1000 highly curated records from my own collection to my fans. Over 300 people showed up, and it was an unforgettable day. It was that moment where I thought, ""Man, I'd really love to own a record store one day"" - and ideally one that would have a space for artists to perfom; like TMR Fest, but as a constant fixture. </p>
<p>I’ve been thinking about the end game of Too Many Records. What is my ultimate goal? What have I worked towards over all these years, putting out content consistently and building these communities within our larger community. The record label is amazing, but that’s just the start of it. I’ve been inspired by stores big, and small, and how they can be cornerstones of their communities. I want to be a part of my community, and this is a way to use my passion and expertise to be a worthy addition. I'm doing this in partnership with my friend Roland, who has been a member of the TMR community for many years now, and is a Portland local. He's proven himself to be a great friend over the years, and I have full confidence that our partnership will give birth to a store that will fit right in with the legendary and admirable ones that currently exist in the area. </p>
<p>Roland and I would be honored if you would help us get our dream off the ground. Below, we will explain the ethos behind the store, and our philosophy about how to make it awesome, as well as tell you about the perks you can get for supporting us!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1629156416/io3rshjymvlg1i3ulwfr.png"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p>We have enough funding to get the store going, but it will certainly be a bumpy ride. We're hoping that, with these rad perks, we'll be able to generate enough support from the community to assist us in polishing the rocketship in prep for take off, and unleash this beast into the world as beautiful as it can be.</p>
<p>We're asking for $25,000, which will help provide a runway for our monthly rent that will be coming in hot as soon as we open, as well as allow us to bolster the store's stock with a few more collection buys before we open the gate to a digger's paradise. </p>
<p>The video on this page explains all the perks available to you, and you can also click through them on the side to get more information. If you have questions about any of them, please don't hesitate to reach out to us!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1629263442/omqqfqoudyexnct1fzuz.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The world is moving further and further away from tactile things and in person experiences. The reason that so many of us love vinyl records is that they temporarily transport us into another world that's enhanced by the ritual of putting a record on, allow us to admire the art and liner notes, and appreciate owning a physical manifestation of a cherished album.</p>
<p>It's easy to buy a record on the internet. It's more fun to buy one in real life. We've spent the better part of our 20's and 30's going in and out of record stores around the world: they've become a second home. Becoming a part of the vibrant music community in Portland, OR is something we are elated and honored to have a chance to do.</p>
<p>If you're a local, you will have another home away from home. A welcoming and warm place to chat music, listen to some good tunes, and dig for your next uncovered treasure.</p>
<p>If you're not local, you will still be able to benefit from the store. Through Too Many Records, I spent 7 years building a community around my passion, knowledge, and taste in the music world. That level of dedication and respect will be a cornerstone of the store's operations, for both digital and in person efforts.</p>
<p>Another important factor as to why we decided on a brick and mortar versus a digital experience is that we are planning on putting a stage in the store. Local artists can sometimes struggle to find a place to showcase their music, and Too Many Records strives to be a destination for them to workshop things they're still figuring out, or play things that they're already proud of and have put into the world. This resource for the community, we hope, will be invaluable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1629156472/ignzsod1tnng1jetsluy.png"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p>Starting a small business is daunting at any point in life, but especially at a time like this. With pandemic related uncertainties looming, the early stage of the store has potential to be a bit dicey. While we have a robust and desirable collection of records (across all genres and eras) to start off with, the longevity of the store depends on finding new and interesting collections to buy, and having the funds to do so.</p>
<p>What provides us with comfort is that many stores pivoted to online sales during the chaos of last year, and found a lot of success with those strategies. We plan to utilize the online community that Too Many Records has built as much as we can in conjunction with marketing efforts in the local community.</p>
<p>Any support you can provide us with will help reduce some of these fears and let our excitement take the wheel, which is the only way this endeavor can be as amazing as we anticipate it being. </p>

We've sold out 12 releases in the span of two years. I also threw “Too Many Records Fest” (highlight reel linked) in March of 2019 in Los Angeles where I had 3 bands play, a live podcast, and ran a pop up shop selling 1000 highly curated records from my own collection to my fans. Over 300 people showed up, and it was an unforgettable day. It was that moment where I thought, ""Man, I'd really love to own a record store one day"" - and ideally one that would have a space for artists to perfom; like TMR Fest, but as a constant fixture. 
I’ve been thinking about the end game of Too Many Records. What is my ultimate goal? What have I worked towards over all these years, putting out content consistently and building these communities within our larger community. The record label is amazing, but that’s just the start of it. I’ve been inspired by stores big, and small, and how they can be cornerstones of their communities. I want to be a part of my community, and this is a way to use my passion and expertise to be a worthy addition. I'm doing this in partnership with my friend Roland, who has been a member of the TMR community for many years now, and is a Portland local. He's proven himself to be a great friend over the years, and I have full confidence that our partnership will give birth to a store that will fit right in with the legendary and admirable ones that currently exist in the area. 
Roland and I would be honored if you would help us get our dream off the ground. Below, we will explain the ethos behind the store, and our philosophy about how to make it awesome, as well as tell you about the perks you can get for supporting us!
 


We have enough funding to get the store going, but it will certainly be a bumpy ride. We're hoping that, with these rad perks, we'll be able to generate enough support from the community to assist us in polishing the rocketship in prep for take off, and unleash this beast into the world as beautiful as it can be.
We're asking for $25,000, which will help provide a runway for our monthly rent that will be coming in hot as soon as we open, as well as allow us to bolster the store's stock with a few more collection buys before we open the gate to a digger's paradise. 
The video on this page explains all the perks available to you, and you can also click through them on the side to get more information. If you have questions about any of them, please don't hesitate to reach out to us!
 


The world is moving further and further away from tactile things and in person experiences. The reason that so many of us love vinyl records is that they temporarily transport us into another world that's enhanced by the ritual of putting a record on, allow us to admire the art and liner notes, and appreciate owning a physical manifestation of a cherished album.
It's easy to buy a record on the internet. It's more fun to buy one in real life. We've spent the better part of our 20's and 30's going in and out of record stores around the world: they've become a second home. Becoming a part of the vibrant music community in Portland, OR is something we are elated and honored to have a chance to do.
If you're a local, you will have another home away from home. A welcoming and warm place to chat music, listen to some good tunes, and dig for your next uncovered treasure.
If you're not local, you will still be able to benefit from the store. Through Too Many Records, I spent 7 years building a community around my passion, knowledge, and taste in the music world. That level of dedication and respect will be a cornerstone of the store's operations, for both digital and in person efforts.
Another important factor as to why we decided on a brick and mortar versus a digital experience is that we are planning on putting a stage in the store. Local artists can sometimes struggle to find a place to showcase their music, and Too Many Records strives to be a destination for them to workshop things they're still figuring out, or play things that they're already proud of and have put into the world. This resource for the community, we hope, will be invaluable.
 


Starting a small business is daunting at any point in life, but especially at a time like this. With pandemic related uncertainties looming, the early stage of the store has potential to be a bit dicey. While we have a robust and desirable collection of records (across all genres and eras) to start off with, the longevity of the store depends on finding new and interesting collections to buy, and having the funds to do so.
What provides us with comfort is that many stores pivoted to online sales during the chaos of last year, and found a lot of success with those strategies. We plan to utilize the online community that Too Many Records has built as much as we can in conjunction with marketing efforts in the local community.
Any support you can provide us with will help reduce some of these fears and let our excitement take the wheel, which is the only way this endeavor can be as amazing as we anticipate it being. 
 


If you don't have the funds to help, that's okay! You can help by spreading the word about the store. Any shares of this crowdfund on socials or forums that you go to would mean the world in helping get the word out. 
Let's make the next great record store, together.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

Why we're asking for your help

Hi there, my name is Gina Lujan and I was 21 when I first started my own business out of necessity. I was a young mom, Latina and had to hustle. I know the struggle facing women-owned business owners because I am one. So when the pandemic hit, my heart went to the mothers (and women) called home from the workplace who wanted to start or had to close their own business but were hampered by the global pandemic facing all of us.

Many small business owners have closed down due to the coronavirus. Women entrepreneurs, in particular, have faced an economic disaster. 
Individuals also lost their pre-pandemic jobs. Micro-businesses are popping up as an alternative to a 9-5, with many earning a living making at home or reselling on Etsy and Facebook Marketplace. 
It was an answer and a solution to find a side-hustle. Now we need to help those intrepid entrepreneurs flourish and survive through this crisis.
By supporting small business, invest in yourself by receiving access to our exclusive perks and partnerships. Donate to women and take classes, or give a membership to a friend.

In addition, small businesses owners have had to pivot due to the crisis. This program also serves them: Supporting women in their business venture, or supporting women who have been forced to reinvent themselves. 

What We Need & What You Get

We need $15,000 for need-based incidentals (from bus passes to laptops) that are roadblocks for women entrepreneurs to support women entrepreneurs fully and holistically.
The MAKEHERS first cohort is already funded to serve 15 people with a $1,000 no strings seed investment for successful participants.
Supporters of the MAKEHERS program will be investing in rebuilding our economy. They will support local small businesses and help re-solidify the American dream for many and come back from one of worst recessions in our country's history equitably and fairly.
In addition, supporters will receive access to:

This program is already partially funded, so future funds will go to supporting the women, a larger emergency relief fund and future cohorts.

The Impact
3 million women have left the workforce due to the coronavirus.  (since COVID)
Over the past 9 years, at Hacker Lab we've served many of the people facing this crisis. As a community makerspace and workforce development incubator, we've personally mentored thousands of startups in the Sacramento region. 
During the pandemic, our team has helped hundreds of entrepreneurs through direct mentorship with the Sacramento Inclusive Economic Development Center.
Over the past year, we've built capacity through our Pathways program, which offers 8-months of access to our space to ambitious entrepreneurs from underserved communities. In our first pilot program, we helped 43 of 57 participants towards their goals of entering a new field, starting a new business or furthering an existing one, or attending higher education.

However, through giving them access to our tools, as well as our extensive network of government, education and job-industry partners and experts, we are confident we can provide significant support — the seed and soil these entrepreneurs need, today.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi friends,</p>
<p>This campaign is about supporting the growth and connection of community. In January 2020, I bought a piece of land in Bastrop, TX with the vision of building a hub for health and family connection – named Bastrop Fitness Project. We are in the homestretch of developing this project and preparing to move three local businesses in to serve the community. In fitness, as in life, I have learned that asking for help makes the push across the finish line that much more possible and enjoyable. By supporting this indiegogo campaign, you would be contributing to the success of small business in Bastrop and providing fuel for us to serve the community where we live, work, and play. </p>
<h3>The Back Story</h3>
<p>When the world was put on pause in March of 2020, I took it as a gift and an opportunity to locate and convene with existing and emerging business owners that shared my values and vision for transforming a building into a community destination – a place where friends and family would meet to pursue health goals and nurture their self-care practices.  </p>
<p>As 2020 went on, I had to come to grips with the realities of permitting, construction, and the rising cost of materials. Many small business owners will tell you that 2020 pushed us to the edge. For me, this meant navigating restrictions as a gym owner, asking for the partnership and patience of our tenants, and praying that all of our businesses could pivot and provide value long enough to outlast the pandemic.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How Your Invest Helps</h3>
<p>The funds raised will support all of the businesses under the Bastrop Fitness Project and will be used in three main areas:</p>
<p><u><i><strong>1. Expedite the Move</strong></i></u></p>
<p>Here are some mock-ups of our new building! We will be located at 303 Martin Luther King Dr, Bastrop, TX, 78602. </p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1621537550/dw5yxlkm6eqbwum1dnz9.png"" src=""""/><p><br/>I’m THRILLED to be moving our gym to our own building, but what is even more exciting to me is that doing so will allow us to serve the Bastrop community in a more HOLISTIC way! We are experts in our modality, but we firmly believe that complete health must include restorative practices (like yoga) and work with your life (like childcare).<br/><br/>Over the past year, each small business in our collective has shouldered a number of additional and unforeseen costs as a result of COVID-19. On top of this – moving is stressful and expensive!</p>
<p>If we reach the $25,000 milestone, we will provide each tenant with a moving allowance that would allow them to hire additional hands or purchase additional resources to support their move and build out.</p>
<p><u><i><strong>2. Offset Rent Increases</strong></i></u></p>
<p>At the start of this endeavor, I worked hard to develop and design a building that could not only meet the needs of our small-businesses but also offered organic opportunities for the community to meet, connect and rejuvenate in our space. The pandemic not only extended our build-time but put us in a difficult position of figuring out how to finish the building during a time when material costs were rising at an unforeseen rate.<br/><br/>I have worked diligently to make decisions that don’t compromise the space for our partners and yet, the result of all of this meant marginal increases to all of our rent.<br/><br/>One of my highest priorities in this campaign to raise enough money to offset any rent increase for our small business partners (tenants) and be able to honor the original rent that they were offered.</p>
<p>The goal of $100,000 would allow us small business owners to move in September 2021 without passing on any additional costs which were incurred because of the COVID-19 pandemic and delays. </p>
<p><u><i><strong>3. Fund Community Scholarships</strong></i></u></p>
<p>We are eager to grow roots, give back, and enhance the health of our neighbors. The last area of investment where we are seeking support is to start a fund which would allow us to underwrite community scholarships in each of our businesses.<br/><br/>With your help, for each $10,000 we raise, we will fully fund a community scholarship to one of our businesses to a neighbor within our own community!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Meet the Businesses</h3>
<p>Bastrop Fitness Project will be home to 3 locally-grown businesses:</p>
<p><u><i><strong>Strive Strength &amp; Conditioning </strong></i></u></p>
<p>Our mission is to empower people to be happier, healthier, and more successful in life. We’re veteran-owned and community powered. <a href=""https://strivebastrop.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Strive</a> is a family first, a gym second. We coach you how to achieve your goals inside the gym so you can smash your goals outside of the gym. Whatever your health and fitness goals are, our professional coaches and supportive community will help you get there. We teach you, hold you accountable, and cheer you every step of the way. There are the people I'm proud to serve...</p>

<p>As we expand into the Bastrop Fitness Project, we will also be expanding our business model. Welcome <i><strong>Strive Human Optimization</strong></i>! Training hard means that you need to recover even harder. Training breaks you down and the only way to really achieve your goals is to allow your body to recover and adapt to the stress the training places on it. That’s why we are now adding a full recovery center that features hot saunas, cold plunge baths, and compression therapy. Progress in your goals just got easier! </p>
<p><u><i><strong>Body + Shine Wellness</strong></i></u></p>
<p>At <a href=""https://www.bodyandshinewellness.com/home"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Body + Shine Wellness</a> (BSW), we aim to make yoga (and related practices) approachable for everyone interested regardless of age, gender, or experience level. We create a fun, friendly, and supportive environment where everyone feels safe, welcome, and never judged. Our practice is light hearted and can fit any student willing to come to their mat. We acknowledge that yoga is a seriously life changing practice, but we remove common stigma and stereotypes and encourage people to enjoy the process.  </p>
<p>Our first location opened in Elgin in 2016, and we are excited to expand our community with our second location in Bastrop. We will be offering many types of yoga--including Power/Flow, Slow/Beginner Stretch, Restorative, cYoga, and even heated classes--along with meditation, Pilates, specialized workshops, teacher training programs, and more. We also offer classes online on demand and a virtual retail boutique so you can connect with us anytime, anywhere. </p>
<p>Meet the Owner: </p>
<p>My name is Katy Gassaway. After years of practicing yoga and meditation, in 2014, I decided to take a teacher training course while I waited to take the Texas Bar Exam. I quickly realized that sharing the practice of yoga with others made me happier and more fulfilled than practicing law or anything else ever had. As a serial small business owner for over a decade, it was inevitable I’d want to expand from our original Elgin studio, and I couldn’t have picked a better place than Bastrop. I am so excited to continue growing with this community!</p>
<p><u><i><strong>Wild Child</strong></i></u></p>
<p>At <a href=""http://wildchildbastrop.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Wild Child</a>, our mission is to prioritize fitness for local families. We provide a safe, fun, and healthy environment where kids ages 3 to 10 are encouraged to get their wiggles out through active play while parents work out. We combine fitness and fun for children by encouraging movement and energetic play on our giant indoor playground- no screens or TV’s! At Wild Child, we put the Wild back in the Child!</p>
<p>Meet the Owner:</p>
<p>My name is Lexi Grose. I am a young entrepreneur with a passion for fitness, health, and working with children. I have worked as a certified CrossFit coach/trainer at Strive Strength and Conditioning in Bastrop from 2019 through 2021. During my time coaching, I recognized that child care is often a barrier for parents trying to prioritize their own health and fitness. Working with children has always been a passion of mine, and I felt called to pursue this further. Wild child was born as an opportunity to serve the community while encouraging kids and adults to prioritize fitness, healthy living, and fun!</p>

Hi friends,
This campaign is about supporting the growth and connection of community. In January 2020, I bought a piece of land in Bastrop, TX with the vision of building a hub for health and family connection – named Bastrop Fitness Project. We are in the homestretch of developing this project and preparing to move three local businesses in to serve the community. In fitness, as in life, I have learned that asking for help makes the push across the finish line that much more possible and enjoyable. By supporting this indiegogo campaign, you would be contributing to the success of small business in Bastrop and providing fuel for us to serve the community where we live, work, and play. 
The Back Story
When the world was put on pause in March of 2020, I took it as a gift and an opportunity to locate and convene with existing and emerging business owners that shared my values and vision for transforming a building into a community destination – a place where friends and family would meet to pursue health goals and nurture their self-care practices.  
As 2020 went on, I had to come to grips with the realities of permitting, construction, and the rising cost of materials. Many small business owners will tell you that 2020 pushed us to the edge. For me, this meant navigating restrictions as a gym owner, asking for the partnership and patience of our tenants, and praying that all of our businesses could pivot and provide value long enough to outlast the pandemic.

How Your Invest Helps
The funds raised will support all of the businesses under the Bastrop Fitness Project and will be used in three main areas:
1. Expedite the Move
Here are some mock-ups of our new building! We will be located at 303 Martin Luther King Dr, Bastrop, TX, 78602. 
I’m THRILLED to be moving our gym to our own building, but what is even more exciting to me is that doing so will allow us to serve the Bastrop community in a more HOLISTIC way! We are experts in our modality, but we firmly believe that complete health must include restorative practices (like yoga) and work with your life (like childcare).Over the past year, each small business in our collective has shouldered a number of additional and unforeseen costs as a result of COVID-19. On top of this – moving is stressful and expensive!
If we reach the $25,000 milestone, we will provide each tenant with a moving allowance that would allow them to hire additional hands or purchase additional resources to support their move and build out.
2. Offset Rent Increases
At the start of this endeavor, I worked hard to develop and design a building that could not only meet the needs of our small-businesses but also offered organic opportunities for the community to meet, connect and rejuvenate in our space. The pandemic not only extended our build-time but put us in a difficult position of figuring out how to finish the building during a time when material costs were rising at an unforeseen rate.I have worked diligently to make decisions that don’t compromise the space for our partners and yet, the result of all of this meant marginal increases to all of our rent.One of my highest priorities in this campaign to raise enough money to offset any rent increase for our small business partners (tenants) and be able to honor the original rent that they were offered.
The goal of $100,000 would allow us small business owners to move in September 2021 without passing on any additional costs which were incurred because of the COVID-19 pandemic and delays. 
3. Fund Community Scholarships
We are eager to grow roots, give back, and enhance the health of our neighbors. The last area of investment where we are seeking support is to start a fund which would allow us to underwrite community scholarships in each of our businesses.With your help, for each $10,000 we raise, we will fully fund a community scholarship to one of our businesses to a neighbor within our own community!

Meet the Businesses
Bastrop Fitness Project will be home to 3 locally-grown businesses:
Strive Strength & Conditioning 
Our mission is to empower people to be happier, healthier, and more successful in life. We’re veteran-owned and community powered. Strive is a family first, a gym second. We coach you how to achieve your goals inside the gym so you can smash your goals outside of the gym. Whatever your health and fitness goals are, our professional coaches and supportive community will help you get there. We teach you, hold you accountable, and cheer you every step of the way. There are the people I'm proud to serve...

As we expand into the Bastrop Fitness Project, we will also be expanding our business model. Welcome Strive Human Optimization! Training hard means that you need to recover even harder. Training breaks you down and the only way to really achieve your goals is to allow your body to recover and adapt to the stress the training places on it. That’s why we are now adding a full recovery center that features hot saunas, cold plunge baths, and compression therapy. Progress in your goals just got easier! 
Body + Shine Wellness
At Body + Shine Wellness (BSW), we aim to make yoga (and related practices) approachable for everyone interested regardless of age, gender, or experience level. We create a fun, friendly, and supportive environment where everyone feels safe, welcome, and never judged. Our practice is light hearted and can fit any student willing to come to their mat. We acknowledge that yoga is a seriously life changing practice, but we remove common stigma and stereotypes and encourage people to enjoy the process.  
Our first location opened in Elgin in 2016, and we are excited to expand our community with our second location in Bastrop. We will be offering many types of yoga--including Power/Flow, Slow/Beginner Stretch, Restorative, cYoga, and even heated classes--along with meditation, Pilates, specialized workshops, teacher training programs, and more. We also offer classes online on demand and a virtual retail boutique so you can connect with us anytime, anywhere. 
Meet the Owner: 
My name is Katy Gassaway. After years of practicing yoga and meditation, in 2014, I decided to take a teacher training course while I waited to take the Texas Bar Exam. I quickly realized that sharing the practice of yoga with others made me happier and more fulfilled than practicing law or anything else ever had. As a serial small business owner for over a decade, it was inevitable I’d want to expand from our original Elgin studio, and I couldn’t have picked a better place than Bastrop. I am so excited to continue growing with this community!
Wild Child
At Wild Child, our mission is to prioritize fitness for local families. We provide a safe, fun, and healthy environment where kids ages 3 to 10 are encouraged to get their wiggles out through active play while parents work out. We combine fitness and fun for children by encouraging movement and energetic play on our giant indoor playground- no screens or TV’s! At Wild Child, we put the Wild back in the Child!
Meet the Owner:
My name is Lexi Grose. I am a young entrepreneur with a passion for fitness, health, and working with children. I have worked as a certified CrossFit coach/trainer at Strive Strength and Conditioning in Bastrop from 2019 through 2021. During my time coaching, I recognized that child care is often a barrier for parents trying to prioritize their own health and fitness. Working with children has always been a passion of mine, and I felt called to pursue this further. Wild child was born as an opportunity to serve the community while encouraging kids and adults to prioritize fitness, healthy living, and fun!

These will be sold at an affordable cost in impoverished nations. We plan on creating jobs in this lacking industry, by training workers and furthering their education through books, mentoring and affordable modern courses. Within the next 5-10 years, we plan on providing significantly in west African countries with Ikiké’s Farms produce.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518673338/hxg20kvaa0qmx9x2cfjk.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>We are to begin achieving this goal by working on land that is already available to us, which is close to 70, 000 square meters now (to be expanded). The first country where this will start is the one where we possess the most land, Guinea Conakry. It is a place with a population most recently reported as 14,000, 000 out of which over 2,000,000 are unsure of where their next meal will come from.</p><p>At some point, we all complained about world hunger. Some issues are complicated, we know. This is one of them. Yet the solution is quite easy. To eradicate famine, modern agricultural theories are way ahead of the current practices.

Although the growth of crops is cyclical we can speed the process up by using more land we can grow large quantities of food suited to certain areas, and by building storage facilities, we can effectively contribute to the already present sources of sustenance.</p><p>There are many industries that are indispensable; this is the one that needs the most attention. For a hungry person cannot tend to any higher pursuits.</p><p>In our business plan, we’ve accommodated a 20 percent donation margin.

We’re hoping that somewhere in the hearts of those who understand this campaign a little support will be found. We believe that the saying “we are stronger together”, is a fact, regardless of all else that is portrayed.</p><p>The next phase of Ikiké’s Farms’ vision is to produce staple food on an ongoing basis. This may seem ludicrous but hear us out. Our founding member, Cheick Ahmed Touré, a writer of 5 books, a final year business student and an autodidact who is fond of playing around with ideas, concocted one that is a viable solution, he calls it the Artificial Plantation TM. It is an environment that will produce staple food during the seasons in which nature does not facilitate their growth. It will mimic the season best suited to the growth of plants, regulated by software that is currently in design associated with a mechanism that will administer temperature, quality, and quantity of light and reproduce the effect of air, while duly irrigating the earth.</p><p>Now you may be thinking, “Oh don’t tell me about GMO’s?”. Well, we hope you aren’t because It’s part of the solution. Genetically modified food is a viable way of producing higher quantities of highly nutritious food and faster.

Our founders are Latinx NYC natives fighting for our home.</p><p>While we are solidifying programming and resources for the community for the next year, unforeseen financial hurdles have severely limited our funding, jeopardizing its long term viability. Buildout came in $10,000 over budget, while only one of two SBA loans applied for came through, $10,000 below the requested amount. Nevertheless, we are committed to giving Mil Mundos a fighting chance.</p><p>So, our strategy is to generate revenue, reduce monthly overhead, and create sustainable revenue streams that will fortify the project going forward. Last week, <strong>we decided as a group to become an all-volunteer run space to help cut costs while it becomes more sustainable.</strong> This brings monthly overhead from roughly $8000 a month down to $3800 a month. Now, we are fundraising to generate capital for the space.</p><h3>....<br/> </h3><p><strong>We are raising $50,000 to help us with the following:</strong></p><ul>
<li>$14,000 - remaining contractor balance owed from buildout</li>
<li>$6,000 - event equipment, shelving, office equipment to provide printing services to the community</li>
<li>$30,000 - six to seven months of overhead costs to give the project time to become sustainable</li>
</ul><p> </p><p><strong>Our Impact</strong></p><p>It has been several decades since there has been a general purpose bookstore that folks in eastern Bushwick can talk about having any sort of regular presence in their lives growing up, let alone a bookstore that also carries titles in the predominant language of the neighborhood. In a neighborhood where gentrification and displacement run rampant, a community resource by and for those who already call Bushwick home is invaluable. Mil Mundos tells our story, speaks our language, and provides for our needs. </p><p>We want to partner with the 30+ schools in the Bushwick area to organize class trips to students' local bookstore. We want to host book fairs at local educational institutions that highlight narratives that community members can identify with. We want to host events that delve into unique and diverse experiences within Black and Latinx culture. We want to unite like-minded writers and publishers, and serve as a network point for folks to meet as they share their stories and the stories of others. With your help, we can do all of this, and so much more.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Our Mission Statement</strong></p><p>Mil Mundos Books’ primary mission is to remain dedicated to larger-scale anti-gentrification work in eastern Bushwick and beyond, and to maintain a curation and space that celebrates Black and Latinx heritage and supports the narratives of these cultures. Our two strategies toward this end are:</p><p>1. Proactively engage with the community - especially with Black and Latinx communities adversely affected by incoming commerce - to maintain a two-way conversation about how best to encourage and support their autonomy and agency in their own neighborhood and lives.</p><p>2. Maintain a culture of acceptance, inclusivity, and healthy communication both within the store and as an organization overall, serving as a model of our commitment to our values in any work environment.</p><p>While we are currently organized as an LLC, it is our goal to eventually transition over to either a worker-owned business model or to a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation. Any profits made after paying off debts and ensuring fair wages for those working the storefront on a daily basis will be reinvested into the community and furthering the mission of the space.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p><p>There are other MAJOR ways you can help!</p><p>VOLUNTEER! If you over 18, live in the NYC area, and speak both English and Spanish, you can make a direct and immediate impact by helping make spaces like these more accessible to the neighborhood. Get involved in our collective process and fill out this form to get started: <a href=""https://tinyurl.com/volunteeratmm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://tinyurl.com/volunteeratmm</a>.</p><p>EDUCATORS: we want to work with you directly. Interested in writing curriculums for schools based on the literature we prioritize? Or maybe you would like to work with us to organize a class trip to the shop, or a book fair at your school? We would love to hear from you! Email info@milmundosbooks.com to get the conversation started.</p><p>LEADERS: we are currently looking for folks who would like to get involved in our broader collective process. Our team right now is small but committed to our mission, and we are always open to working with others who share our passion for this project as well. If you are interested, you can also email info@milmundosbooks.com to schedule a time for us to all meet up!</p><p>SPREAD THE WORD! Share our campaign on social media, talk about it with your friends and neighbors, come by the store for a visit or a workshop! Planned upcoming workshops include:</p><ul>
<li>soap making: learn how to make soap from ingredients in your kitchen that you love</li>
<li>candle making: learn how to make your own delicious candles at home</li>
<li>block carving: learn how to make wooden hand-carved block prints</li>
<li>fermentation lab: learn how to make kimchi, sauerkraut or pickled veggies</li>

With your support, we will keep this vibrant and crucial community resource alive for many years to come.</p></div>","Mil Mundos Books is a bilingual bookstore and community center located in Bushwick, Brooklyn, that curates to celebrate Black and Latinx heritage and culture. Our mission, in brief, is to resist gentrification, empower community members, and to be a resource in a working class community, for the community that’s already here. Our founders are Latinx NYC natives fighting for our home.While we are solidifying programming and resources for the community for the next year, unforeseen financial hurdles have severely limited our funding, jeopardizing its long term viability. Buildout came in $10,000 over budget, while only one of two SBA loans applied for came through, $10,000 below the requested amount. Nevertheless, we are committed to giving Mil Mundos a fighting chance.So, our strategy is to generate revenue, reduce monthly overhead, and create sustainable revenue streams that will fortify the project going forward. Last week, we decided as a group to become an all-volunteer run space to help cut costs while it becomes more sustainable. This brings monthly overhead from roughly $8000 a month down to $3800 a month. Now, we are fundraising to generate capital for the space..... We are raising $50,000 to help us with the following:
$14,000 - remaining contractor balance owed from buildout
$6,000 - event equipment, shelving, office equipment to provide printing services to the community
$30,000 - six to seven months of overhead costs to give the project time to become sustainable
 Our ImpactIt has been several decades since there has been a general purpose bookstore that folks in eastern Bushwick can talk about having any sort of regular presence in their lives growing up, let alone a bookstore that also carries titles in the predominant language of the neighborhood. In a neighborhood where gentrification and displacement run rampant, a community resource by and for those who already call Bushwick home is invaluable. Mil Mundos tells our story, speaks our language, and provides for our needs. We want to partner with the 30+ schools in the Bushwick area to organize class trips to students' local bookstore. We want to host book fairs at local educational institutions that highlight narratives that community members can identify with. We want to host events that delve into unique and diverse experiences within Black and Latinx culture. We want to unite like-minded writers and publishers, and serve as a network point for folks to meet as they share their stories and the stories of others. With your help, we can do all of this, and so much more. Our Mission StatementMil Mundos Books’ primary mission is to remain dedicated to larger-scale anti-gentrification work in eastern Bushwick and beyond, and to maintain a curation and space that celebrates Black and Latinx heritage and supports the narratives of these cultures. Our two strategies toward this end are:1. Proactively engage with the community - especially with Black and Latinx communities adversely affected by incoming commerce - to maintain a two-way conversation about how best to encourage and support their autonomy and agency in their own neighborhood and lives.2. Maintain a culture of acceptance, inclusivity, and healthy communication both within the store and as an organization overall, serving as a model of our commitment to our values in any work environment.While we are currently organized as an LLC, it is our goal to eventually transition over to either a worker-owned business model or to a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation. Any profits made after paying off debts and ensuring fair wages for those working the storefront on a daily basis will be reinvested into the community and furthering the mission of the space. Other Ways You Can HelpThere are other MAJOR ways you can help!VOLUNTEER!

<h3>A Little About Vernalicious</h3>
<p>After feeding thousands of people at hundreds of events throughout Philly, we have decided to park the truck for the very last time and embark on a new adventure... a brick and mortar restaurant. Finally, you'll be able to step inside and sit down to truly enjoy a Vernalicious creation in the comfort of our new home. </p>
<p>Over the years we have learned a lot about preparing simply good food and now, we are hungry to bring that skill to the next level.</p>
<p>We found a location - got the keys in fact! - and are proud to call South Philly our new home. Located just steps away from from the box stores along Columbus Blvd, the only boxes WE'LL have at our quaint Front &amp; Ritner Sts location will be those we use for take away!</p>
<p>Our restaurant will feature a scrumptious menu of roasted chicken, pork and vegetable dishes. We'll offer ready-to-eat take-away meals as well as comfortable table service.  We are working on adding curbside pickup as well, to allow guests to grab meals to take home without having to find parking. Whatever we can do to spread that Vernalicious Love &lt;3</p>
<h3>The Vernalicious Mission</h3>
<p>• To source the most natural, local, no-antibiotics, no growth hormones and no preservatives products available.<br/>• For 25 years we have contributed tens of thousands of dollars (along with volunteer time) to several local non-profit organizations. We pledge to continue community support in our new venture.<br/>• The restaurant will be an incubator and collaborative space to host local culinary talent in achieving their dreams. Look forward to exciting events and pop-ups with established and aspiring chefs, bakers, producers and makers. </p>

<p>We support radical self-acceptance through personal responsibility.</p>
<p>We are creating waves of change, growth, healing and evolution, rippling out into our families and ultimately the entire world around us.</p>
<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>I am Aprilynn Noriega and I imagined the most practical way to create the largest impact in the development of healthy communities; gathering all the resources, direction and healing support that has been an essential part of my own journey to wellness.</p>
<p>Partnering with Sunny Freeman was a divine intervention, amplifying the magnitude of vision we had the potential to tap into. As a life long peace activist and grassroots community organizer, she has spared no expense in the pursuit of creating a better world.

<h3>Overcoming Adversity</h3>
<p>When I left all I had known and fought for as my 15 year marriage collapsed I was faced with utter and complete uncertainty for both myself and my the three children.  I took every step forward in complete faith though it most often felt like a long walk of a short plank. Guided by the gifts afforded me through my own awakening I have challenged the status quo at every turn, following my heart and my heart alone.  Never compromising my internal compass as my only authority has proven a saving grace. I wish to in turn help develop  this in others as they step into the sheer magnificence of the miraculous upon claiming their own spiritual sovereignty. </p>
<p>The leap out of challenge and struggle toward security has been no different. With no guarantee of success and every risk of failure, I have persisted, determined to offer my children the quality of life they can thrive in, determined to show the world that their deepest longing is a heart song the world will match in effort.</p>
<p>Reclaiming our spiritual sovereignty individually and collectively as we learn to once again follow our heart's calling is the only answer to saving both ourselves and the very world around us. We are all already risking everything with in a world desperate for revolution. Everyone of us has to go all in.</p>

<p>Opened in February 2018, <a href=""http://thelev.co"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Lev</a> is a pop-up community bookstore for women and children located in Venice, Los Angeles. I founded The Lev for two main reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>A community space for women</strong>: Without specifically intending to, most businesses are patriarchal. It is more important than ever that women have a community space for comfort and security.</li>
<li>
<strong>Promote women and people of color writers</strong>: Reading other peoples’ stories helps build empathy and understanding.</li>

<p>The Lev has served 600+ customers and processed more than 800 transactions but without the support of you and our community, The Lev will not flourish. Here are three main challenges we’re facing:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Real estate in LA is extremely expensive.</strong> To open, The Lev shared spaces with amazing brands (many thanks to <a href=""http://www.linusbike.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Linus Bike</a> and <a href=""https://www.shopboyandgirl.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">boy+girl</a> for supporting The Lev). However, for The Lev to fulfill its mission of serving as a community bookstore, we need our own space. As such, we’re opening the search for a long term home to include all of LA. Our hope is to still stay in Venice or the surrounding area.</li>
<li>
<strong>Financial solvency.</strong> Since rent will be high, The Lev will have tight sales goals. With The Lev membership program, we hope that our community will be loyal customers. However, The Lev plans to invest in a strategic marketing plan.</li>
<li>
<strong>The unexpected. </strong> A part of the funds being raised is dedicated to having an operations reserve.</li>
</ol>
<p>With your support, I am committed to making The Lev a long-term establishment. My goal is to open a new storefront by September. I already have author events planned for the fall.</p>

<p>“Without specifically intending to, most businesses are patriarchal, and as such, some bookstores are. For me, reading books is a comfort — I wanted to create a bookstore for women so that we have a place for comfort and security.” - Miriam Chan, <a href=""https://idealwoman.us/blogs/crushes/miriam-chan-owner-of-the-lev"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Ideal Woman</i></a></p>
<p>Miriam Chan is the owner and founder of The Lev. She knows what it takes for a business to succeed. Prior to The Lev, Miriam helped grow operations at startup company Civis Analytics from 13 employees to 140+, and led western state operations on President Barack Obama's reelection campaign in 2012.  Miriam’s love for books started at an early age. Her fondest memories are of her parents taking her to the county library and local bookstore as a child.

Opened in February 2018, The Lev is a pop-up community bookstore for women and children located in Venice, Los Angeles. I founded The Lev for two main reasons:


A community space for women: Without specifically intending to, most businesses are patriarchal. It is more important than ever that women have a community space for comfort and security.

Promote women and people of color writers: Reading other peoples’ stories helps build empathy and understanding.

​
The Lev has brought together an amazing community of readers, connected online communities such as Girls at Library (GAL) and Mend by hosting over 20 author readings, talks, storytime & art hours, book swaps, workshops, monthly book clubs and other community events in only four months.
We’ve had the great pleasure of hosting artists, makers and writers such as Roda Ahmed, Mari Andrew, Trish Baden (Flores Lane), Katelynn Bartiromo, Danielle Birrittella (The Intuitive Voice),  Zinzi Clemmons, Lisa Cole (Hungry Right Meow), Yrsa Daley-Ward, Magdalena Edwards, Erin Falconer, The Fullest, Amy Harrison (The Little Studio LA), Aishwarya Iyer (Brightland), Mira T. Lee, Shira Lenchewski, MariNaomi, Laura Rubin (AllSwell), Yumi Sakugawa, Emily Stroia, Dydine Umunyana, Ally Walsh & Casey Wojtalewicz (Canyon Coffee), Jen Wang, Shinay Watts (Ellie and Sass), Stephanie Waxman, Meredith Westgate, Maude White, Women's National Book Association Los Angeles, and Fran Yang (Incandescent Bloom).
See our upcoming events here!

To prepare for opening The Lev pop up, I spoke with many booksellers across the country and even flew to a bookstore in Oklahoma City, Commonplace Books, to shadow owner Ben Nockels (to whom I am incredibly grateful) to learn about the journey of a community-focused bookstore. Many thanks to American Booksellers Association,  Books are Magic, Brazos Bookstore, The Dial Bookshop, Duende District, The Ripped Bodice, and Women & Children First for your generous advice ranging from the mundane to the magic of hosting our favorite writers. 

The Lev has served 600+ customers and processed more than 800 transactions but without the support of you and our community, The Lev will not flourish. Here are three main challenges we’re facing:


Real estate in LA is extremely expensive. To open, The Lev shared spaces with amazing brands (many thanks to Linus Bike and boy+girl for supporting The Lev). However, for The Lev to fulfill its mission of serving as a community bookstore, we need our own space. As such, we’re opening the search for a long term home to include all of LA. Our hope is to still stay in Venice or the surrounding area.

Financial solvency. Since rent will be high, The Lev will have tight sales goals. With The Lev membership program, we hope that our community will be loyal customers. However, The Lev plans to invest in a strategic marketing plan.

The unexpected.  A part of the funds being raised is dedicated to having an operations reserve.

With your support, I am committed to making The Lev a long-term establishment. My goal is to open a new storefront by September. I already have author events planned for the fall.

“Without specifically intending to, most businesses are patriarchal, and as such, some bookstores are. For me, reading books is a comfort — I wanted to create a bookstore for women so that we have a place for comfort and security.” - Miriam Chan, Ideal Woman
Miriam Chan is the owner and founder of The Lev. She knows what it takes for a business to succeed. Prior to The Lev, Miriam helped grow operations at startup company Civis Analytics from 13 employees to 140+, and led western state operations on President Barack Obama's reelection campaign in 2012.  Miriam’s love for books started at an early age. Her fondest memories are of her parents taking her to the county library and local bookstore as a child. Her absolute favorite writers are Maggie Nelson and Jean Rhys but is currently crushing on Elaine Castillo and Lisa Halliday. When not in the bookstore, visiting local bookstores or supporting local LA businesses, Miriam practices yoga and is a certified yoga instructor from her training at Venice's Love Yoga.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Are you a nerd? I am! I grew up watching sci-fi, reading fantasy, and playing table-top and RPG games like Dungeons and Dragons. I love a good super hero movie and I get excited for comic-con or fan-expo every year.</p>
<p>I think we all have an inner nerd hidden in us somewhere just waiting to get out. Some make fun of us for our interests or obsessions, which is why we are making a place for Nerdkind, where no matter what your interests you can find your people and be yourself. Sports fans have sports bars and now nerds have <strong>nerd bars</strong>!</p>
<h3>What We Offer</h3>
<p><strong>Great Food, Epic Fun! </strong><br/><br/>Our Masterful Head Chef, <strong>Myles Hilliard</strong> has been in the industry for over a decade bringing new flavors and concepts to restaurants all over Southern Ontario. Also known as ""<strong>Kodiak</strong>"", he leaped at the chance to start up our restaurant as the only thing he likes more than food is nerd culture. He's cooked up a wonderful menu full of fun, tasty and nerdy items! Using <strong>fresh, local ingredients</strong>,<strong> </strong>you can expect to see things like <strong>The Dragon's Larder Meat Board</strong> (with a rich variety of local meats and cheeses), <strong>Targ Chops and Gagh</strong> (a sci-fi twist on Pork chops and German Spaeztle-noodles), and our mouth watering <strong>Merovingian's Cheesecake</strong>!<br/><br/>And that's not all! We have experienced Dungeon Masters who are hosting a massive <strong>Dungeons and Dragons campaign</strong>, playable by players old and new - your character can go on adventures from month to month, questing with different players as you discover the secrets of The Watchtower, meet the heroes who conquered the keep, and if you distinguish yourself, be recorded in the <strong>Tome of Heroes</strong> and painted into the <strong>Mural of Champions</strong>!<br/><br/>And the best part is - We offer a welcoming, friendly experience for nerds and geeks of all kinds - we love video games, science fiction, fantasy, comics and everything in between. <strong>No nerd cred required</strong> - no matter the depth of your experience, we think you're awesome for all the fun things that you love!

Si no se pudiera recaudar el total por medio del Crowdfounding digital pensamos realizar campañas presenciales para recaudar fondos. Es decir actividades de recaudación a la vieja escuela. 
Las ideas están aquí. Solo ocupamos su apoyo. Yo trabajaré dia y noche para lograr que este projecto se cumpla!
 
Otras formas en las que puedes ayudar Algunas personas no pueden colaborar, pero eso no significa que no puedan ayudar:

 Si tal vez no tenés los fondos para colaborar en la parte del dinero, no es problema!! Es de mucha ayuda que pudieras compartir esta campaña en tus redes sociales, contarle a tus amigos y familiares. Postear en paginas de interés sobre esta propuesta. 
Recordá que Indigogo te ofrece herramientas para compartir.

Todos podemos apoyar!! Y eso es todo.Muchas gracias por haber leido hasta aqui!!! Se que puede ser tedioso... asi que lo agradezco de verdad. Te enviaría un abrazo si se pudiera. Laura",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>My name is Dave Theimer</h3>
<p>The reason I am attempting this is because I am passionate about motorcycles and even more passionate about my sister, but on a fixed income I can't afford the first motorcycle, much less to start a business. I can do in house financing and help people with the same passion ride.  Of course I will demand full insurance, a good down payment, and never let a bike leave before it's paid for itself.  Fortunately I have my son here to help me iron out the details.  He's owned his own business for several years now and been very successful himself.</p>
<p>This also gives me a chance to do something along the way of cerebral palsey.  When I  was a teen, and my sister passed, I told myself that I would do something to help.  What I am doing may not be much but it will be something.  With the help of you good people I can accomplish it.  There are so many things here that ask for money, but I would appreciate whatever you can afford. </p>

In the winter artists will come and retreat to focus and develop their creative work and in the summer travelers will stay over to experience the extreme coziness of the fjord and its beautiful community.   Wether they are travelers or artists we want our guests to experience a cultural immersion. Upstairs the fully equipped apartment floor is designed for cocooning and aims at becoming an artists den, a place to retreat, develop and create. Downstairs, the studio gallery is a lively floor, a melting pot of creation open to the public to stimulate exchange with the visitors and locals of Seyðisfjörður, and to exhibit and retail the artists' works.The curation and open calls for residency at The Old Bookshop will be refined every year as the studio gallery evolves and gets shaped through time. As a traditional place of book we will encourage the artists residents to leave a printed trace of their work and and contribute to develop a collection ""made in Seyðisfjörður"".Currently the studio gallery is hosting work and projects by :- ESUALC- The Scent Bank- Laura Tack- Berglind Águstdóttir The houseIt was built in 1898 and was first a residential house before becoming a book and toy shop in the mid 1950's. It is built on two floors, currently downstairs is a studio gallery and upstairs will be a 2 bedrooms fully furnished residency apartment.In the beginning of the years 2000 the Old Bookshop (Gamla Bókabúðin in Icelandic) became a project space ran by Skaftfell, the Center for Visual Art of East Iceland.An additional part was built in 1989 and will soon open as a coffee house that will offer more possibilities for exhibitions and pop-up events.Despite the major repairs to make the old house has a high potential to thrive anew. There is also 900m² of land that will be transformed by a landscaper in the years to come.Today the house is in a very bad shape and needs major repairs :- the roof is heavily damaged and needs to be replaced and insulated asap - there is no hot water system in the house and the electricity needs to be replaced- the staircase needs to be changed - a drainage system around the house needs to be set up- all the windows upstairs need to be replaced -the corrugated iron walls need to be replaced  they need to be fit the aesthetics standards of the time it was built. - the apartment needs to be fully furnishedEstimated costs for renovation material and labour :- Roof replacement and insulation : 15.000USD- Hot water system and plumbery : 15.000USD- Electricity : 3.000USD- Windows : 8.000USD- Drainage system : 2.000USD- Corrugated iron walls and insulation : 10.000USD- Staircase : 2.000USD- Furnishing : 20.000USDTotal : 75.000USD  Why fundraising?Today, the project needs funds in order to get launched. A solid business plan was elaborated in 2017, the interior has been designed and the construction team ready for action. All the money invested to buy the house came from my wool craft and I have literally ""crocheted ""  the house. Now in order to get another loan from the bank and start renovating I need your support to kick off the project. 20.000USD are needed obtain the loan and start This is a place of creation, it is very much community oriented and its first mission will be to promote the ""made in Seyðisfjörður"". Your rewardsYour support is the key to the success of this project and for that you deserve the best I can offer.Whatever amount you contribute will give you access to the fjord. You will love your reward 100% made in Seyðisfjörður.All the products offered are manufactured in the studio gallery of the Old Bookshop. You can choose to get love crystals, scarves or shawls from my crocheted woolen collection, essential waters made from local plants, two nights stay over in the house, a week of cultural immersion with crochet and olfactive workshops or a month of artist residency in the house.Elsku Seyðisfirðingar! Ég er með sérstak tilbóð fyrir ykkur <3 About SeyðisfjörðurThe house is located in the fjord of Seyðisfjörður in the picturesque Austurland region of Iceland. It is a fishing village of 665 inhabitants with a very vibrant art community including, art festivals (LungA, List í Ljósi), art residencies (Skaftfell, Heima), artists groups (RoShamBo, Skálar), and an art school (LungA School).All the facilities can be found at a 2 minutes walking distance from the house. Seyðisfjörður is accessible by road, air (Egilsstaðir domestic airport 25km) and sea (ferry terminal for Smiryl Line connecting Denmark and the Faroese Islands).During the summer you can enjoy several outdoor activities such as kayaking in the fjord, hiking the seven peaks, playing golf, observing whales and puffins on the cliffs of Skálanes.Seyðisfjörður is also becoming a culinary destination with probably the best sushi restaurant in Iceland. Me, mYself & IMy name is Philippe Clause, I am a French multidisciplinary artist based in Iceland since 2006 with a singing and acting education. Being in Iceland awakened my artistic sensitivity and through the years I taught myself to craft my creativity and I explored different artistic fields such as designing and performing. Today my main activity is my work with wool with my label ESUALC and recently I have started an olfactive venture called the Scent Bank.In 2013 I transformed my previous house as a creative lab with a shop corner. There I welcomed artists with various backgrounds and exhibited or retailed their works whether it was paintings, prints, sculptures, nature art, ceramics. I also welcomed bunch of volunteers and travelers who wanted to have a different type of experience in Iceland.In 2016 I had saved up enough money to get a loan at the bank and get the Old Bookshop on an auction sale. Since March 2017 I have setup my artistic activities on the studio gallery floor of the house and there I work and retail the products I am creating along the artwork of fellow artists, The Old Bookshop will only rise again thanks to you and I will be crafting your rewards with all my heart.FOLLOW THE JOURNEY ON FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM

<h2>What is No Carne?</h2>

<h3><i>No Carne LIFESTYLE – Vegan Lifestyle &amp; Media Company</i></h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.instagram.com/nocarne"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>No Carne LIFESTYLE </strong></a>is a <i>Vegan Lifestyle and Media Company</i> based in <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Bronx,+NY/@40.8517687,-73.9109745,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c28b553a697cb1:0x556e43a78ff15c77!8m2!3d40.8447819!4d-73.8648268"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Bronx, NY</a>. Our mission is to help raise awareness of what it means to be <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veganism"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">vegan</a>, by creating and sharing <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/Bx1ODYtJotR/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">plant-based</a> <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/BxrATW0hGBz/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">lifestyle</a> <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/B4Gg2rChUWf/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">content</a>, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/B64PHxfj6gk/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">experiences</a> and more—for everyone, while building relationships with our vastly growing community. We are first and foremost a digital media company with a focus on plant-based food and lifestyle content. We also create and share animal rights and climate related content to help raise awareness on those issues.</p>
<p>As a media company, we create visual, audio and written content in the form of food photography, lifestyle memes, video content, a soon-to-launch IGTV series &amp; podcast, written articles, blogs and much more. Most of our content is derived from our own No Carne BODEGA food, our No Carne MARKET events and events we vend at or we attend. We also create and share a lot of content like vegan food photos and videos from restaurants and other establishments we visit. Often we'll share climate related content from other creators and platforms as we get ready to launch our own No Carne COMMUNITY project.</p>
<p>With this campaign we hope to establish and grow our Media Team and continue to create even more informative and consumable content to keep raising awareness of all the benefits of a plant-based lifestyle. Together we can fund this project and write the next chapter of what will one day be a globally recognized brand.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><i>No Carne BODEGA – Vegan Deli &amp; Grocery</i></h3>
<p>In early 2019, we launched <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/NoCarneBODEGA/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i><strong>No Carne BODEGA</strong></i></a>, our <i>Online Vegan Deli &amp; Grocery Store</i> on <strong><a href=""https://www.ubereats.com/en-US/new-york/food-delivery/no-carne-bodega/HrXPuaT3SKGmvnHLlzOFtg/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>UberEats</i></a></strong>, <a href=""https://postmates.com/merchant/no-carne-bodega-bronx"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong><i>Postmates</i></strong></a>, <strong><i><a href=""https://www.doordash.com/store/no-carne-bodega-the-bronx-664687/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">DoorDash</a></i></strong>, <a href=""https://www.mercato.com/shop/no-carne-bodega"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i><strong>Mercato</strong></i></a> and on our website <a href=""http://NoCarneBODEGA.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i><strong>NoCarneBODEGA.com</strong></i></a>. We're in the process of renovating our space so that we can open to the public and accept pick-up orders as well. Part of the funds raised in this campaign will go towards growing the No Carne BODEGA brand, and opening up a location in the Belmont section of The Bronx.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><i>No Carne MARKET – Vegan Night Market Series</i></h3>
<p>This past November, on <i>Small Business Saturday</i>, we launched <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/nocarnemarket/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i><strong>No Carne MARKET</strong></i></a>, our <i>Vegan Night Market Series</i> throughout <strong>NYC</strong>. As of now, we have our monthly <strong>Uptown No Carne MARKET</strong> in <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/place/Inwood,+New+York,+NY/@40.8666782,-73.9390905,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c2f3f71ea2a777:0x473fc122f5dd021c!8m2!3d40.8677145!4d-73.9212019"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Inwood, Manhattan</i></a>, and our <strong>Bushwick No Carne MARKET</strong> in <i><a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bushwick,+Brooklyn,+NY/@40.6942535,-73.9389312,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c25c11aa458453:0x8b29c89949c0c67c!8m2!3d40.6957755!4d-73.9170604"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Brooklyn</a>. </i>Part of the funds raised in this campaign will go towards expanding No Carne MARKET and bringing our vegan night market series to The Bronx, Queens, Staten Island and beyond!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><i>No Carne STREET – Ethical Streetwear Brand</i></h3>
<p>One of the first things we've always wanted to do was create an ethical <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streetwear"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">streetwear</a> brand that represented the fashion and culture of our home: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMunCo7_FWc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Bronx</a>. Our first few <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/BvKKLaGg4tO/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">t-shirts</a> and hats were a hit at our <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/BxHuoJClD7z/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">pop-up events</a> and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/B14L2F3lRt3/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">online</a> on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/ByosVp-BSm9/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">social media</a>. People from all over have been asking: ""When will they launch on your website?"" With all the buzz, we decided to step back and plan the relaunch of our apparel division. We've even rebranded it as <i><strong><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/nocarnestreet/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">No Carne STREET</a></strong></i>, and we have a lot of plans for the brand for 2020! Part of the funds raised in this campaign will go towards growing <i>No Carne STREET</i> at scale, and launching our online apparel store and making our apparel available to everyone anywhere.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><i>No Carne COMMUNITY – Non-Profit Community Org.</i></h3>
<p>This year we want to launch the most important project of our lives: <i><strong>No Carne COMMUNITY</strong></i>. This idea for a non-profit community organization is actually what lead to the idea for <i>No Carne LIFESTYLE</i>. We quickly realized the best way for us to eventually launch a non-profit organization was to first build an online community and then establish a business that can lead to ongoing funding for our non-profit.</p>
<p>Why did we take this approach? Because we believe there are many ways to get people engaged for a good cause, and the way we prefer to go about it is to create food, products, content and experiences that people enjoy and would like to buy and consume, and then put a significant part of the proceeds from those sales towards funding <i>No Carne COMMUNITY</i>. The vision for our Indiegogo Campaign is to raise funds to grow the business, to then have the business fund the non-profit. We strongly believe with your help we can make this vision a reality.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><i>#Not62 Campaign – The Bronx, NY</i></h3>
<p>This past year The Bronx has once again been ranked LAST (#62) on the list of unhealthiest counties in New York State. Ironically, just across the river, Manhattan (NY County) is ranked as one of the healthiest in the state. Our fundamental goal with <i>No Carne BODEGA</i> and <i>No Carne MARKET</i> is to make healthy, plant-based food more accessible in our borough and throughout the under-served communities in our city. We hope to contribute to the efforts of the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=12&amp;v=-5gpufKkfL4&amp;feature=emb_title"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">#Not62 Campaign</a>.</p>
<p>Not only do we plan on launching our Bronx No Carne MARKET very soon, but we're also working on a community program that we can implement immediately to help introduce (or reintroduce) people to plant-based foods and create a healthy, supportive network where we can all contribute to the efforts of building a healthier Bronx.</p>
<p>Now all that sounds great, but we need to get the word out. That's where we rely on the media capabilities of <i>No Carne LIFESTYLE</i>. Our job is to do the work we do, help make things better and then document and capture those moments, convert them to consumable digital content to continue to raise awareness. We know this approach will work, and if we can get you onboard to help us make it happen, we guarantee that it will work, it's just a matter of time. Let's make this happen now!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><i>This Is Bigger Than Us</i></h3>
<p>We understand that we're just a small part of a bigger movement. Many people and many organizations in The Bronx, and in the world, have already been doing good in so many ways. This campaign, and essentially our entire company exists just so that we can contribute to the ongoing efforts of so many who are leading the fight for a better future.</p>
<p>Another great benefit from the success of this crowdfunding campaign and our business is the fact that we'll have access to capital that can be contributed and donated to various charities and non-profit organizations, such as climate action groups, community health programs, informational and educational groups, animal sanctuaries and more. We should all support each others movements in some capacity, and we look forward to doing our part in working with or contributing to other organizations who are making a difference.</p>
<p>Although we are currently operating at a loss, we've already committed to donating 15% of No Carne BODEGA's profits. This campaign will help us achieve profitability and be able to make those donations happen. The main reason we haven't turned a profit is because we went all in on marketing and building brand. We gave away free food, snacks, beverages, groceries, everything. We ran Facebook and Instagram ads and they paid off. We made some things happen, we got exposure, and here we are now, ready to take this to the next level!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Although this is a Local Business campaign, this is truly a community project. And although we're looking to help and give back to our local community in The Bronx, we also want to continue to establish ourselves as a reputable brand in the global community.

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We don't believe there's any risk in choosing to contribute to this campaign. We're already a legally established company and we're already in business.

There's virtually no risk in trying to help us help people.</p>
<p>We're essentially already making things happen, just on a smaller scale. The biggest challenge would be to reach enough people to make a huge impact on our world! And that's a challenge we're willing to face. Adversity has been a part of every step in this journey, and we're not going to give up now. What are we going to do if we don't reach our $25,000 goal? <strong>KEEP GOING!</strong></p>

</div></div>","What is No Carne?
 
No Carne LIFESTYLE – Vegan Lifestyle & Media Company
No Carne LIFESTYLE is a Vegan Lifestyle and Media Company based in The Bronx, NY. Our mission is to help raise awareness of what it means to be vegan, by creating and sharing plant-based lifestyle content, experiences and more—for everyone, while building relationships with our vastly growing community. We are first and foremost a digital media company with a focus on plant-based food and lifestyle content. We also create and share animal rights and climate related content to help raise awareness on those issues.
As a media company, we create visual, audio and written content in the form of food photography, lifestyle memes, video content, a soon-to-launch IGTV series & podcast, written articles, blogs and much more. Most of our content is derived from our own No Carne BODEGA food, our No Carne MARKET events and events we vend at or we attend. We also create and share a lot of content like vegan food photos and videos from restaurants and other establishments we visit. Often we'll share climate related content from other creators and platforms as we get ready to launch our own No Carne COMMUNITY project.
With this campaign we hope to establish and grow our Media Team and continue to create even more informative and consumable content to keep raising awareness of all the benefits of a plant-based lifestyle. Together we can fund this project and write the next chapter of what will one day be a globally recognized brand.
 
No Carne BODEGA – Vegan Deli & Grocery
In early 2019, we launched No Carne BODEGA, our Online Vegan Deli & Grocery Store on UberEats, Postmates, DoorDash, Mercato and on our website NoCarneBODEGA.com. We're in the process of renovating our space so that we can open to the public and accept pick-up orders as well. Part of the funds raised in this campaign will go towards growing the No Carne BODEGA brand, and opening up a location in the Belmont section of The Bronx.
 
No Carne MARKET – Vegan Night Market Series
This past November, on Small Business Saturday, we launched No Carne MARKET, our Vegan Night Market Series throughout NYC. As of now, we have our monthly Uptown No Carne MARKET in Inwood, Manhattan, and our Bushwick No Carne MARKET in Brooklyn. Part of the funds raised in this campaign will go towards expanding No Carne MARKET and bringing our vegan night market series to The Bronx, Queens, Staten Island and beyond!
 
No Carne STREET – Ethical Streetwear Brand
One of the first things we've always wanted to do was create an ethical streetwear brand that represented the fashion and culture of our home: The Bronx. Our first few t-shirts and hats were a hit at our pop-up events and online on social media. People from all over have been asking: ""When will they launch on your website?"" With all the buzz, we decided to step back and plan the relaunch of our apparel division. We've even rebranded it as No Carne STREET, and we have a lot of plans for the brand for 2020! Part of the funds raised in this campaign will go towards growing No Carne STREET at scale, and launching our online apparel store and making our apparel available to everyone anywhere.
 
No Carne COMMUNITY – Non-Profit Community Org.
This year we want to launch the most important project of our lives: No Carne COMMUNITY. This idea for a non-profit community organization is actually what lead to the idea for No Carne LIFESTYLE. We quickly realized the best way for us to eventually launch a non-profit organization was to first build an online community and then establish a business that can lead to ongoing funding for our non-profit.
Why did we take this approach? Because we believe there are many ways to get people engaged for a good cause, and the way we prefer to go about it is to create food, products, content and experiences that people enjoy and would like to buy and consume, and then put a significant part of the proceeds from those sales towards funding No Carne COMMUNITY. The vision for our Indiegogo Campaign is to raise funds to grow the business, to then have the business fund the non-profit. We strongly believe with your help we can make this vision a reality.
 
#Not62 Campaign – The Bronx, NY
This past year The Bronx has once again been ranked LAST (#62) on the list of unhealthiest counties in New York State. Ironically, just across the river, Manhattan (NY County) is ranked as one of the healthiest in the state. Our fundamental goal with No Carne BODEGA and No Carne MARKET is to make healthy, plant-based food more accessible in our borough and throughout the under-served communities in our city. We hope to contribute to the efforts of the #Not62 Campaign.
Not only do we plan on launching our Bronx No Carne MARKET very soon, but we're also working on a community program that we can implement immediately to help introduce (or reintroduce) people to plant-based foods and create a healthy, supportive network where we can all contribute to the efforts of building a healthier Bronx.
Now all that sounds great, but we need to get the word out. That's where we rely on the media capabilities of No Carne LIFESTYLE. Our job is to do the work we do, help make things better and then document and capture those moments, convert them to consumable digital content to continue to raise awareness. We know this approach will work, and if we can get you onboard to help us make it happen, we guarantee that it will work, it's just a matter of time. Let's make this happen now!
 
This Is Bigger Than Us
We understand that we're just a small part of a bigger movement. Many people and many organizations in The Bronx, and in the world, have already been doing good in so many ways. This campaign, and essentially our entire company exists just so that we can contribute to the ongoing efforts of so many who are leading the fight for a better future.
Another great benefit from the success of this crowdfunding campaign and our business is the fact that we'll have access to capital that can be contributed and donated to various charities and non-profit organizations, such as climate action groups, community health programs, informational and educational groups, animal sanctuaries and more. We should all support each others movements in some capacity, and we look forward to doing our part in working with or contributing to other organizations who are making a difference.
Although we are currently operating at a loss, we've already committed to donating 15% of No Carne BODEGA's profits. This campaign will help us achieve profitability and be able to make those donations happen. The main reason we haven't turned a profit is because we went all in on marketing and building brand. We gave away free food, snacks, beverages, groceries, everything. We ran Facebook and Instagram ads and they paid off. We made some things happen, we got exposure, and here we are now, ready to take this to the next level!
 

What We Need & What You Get
Here's  the breakdown:
We're looking to raise $25,000 to grow No Carne LIFESTYLE, expand No Carne BODEGA, launch more No Carne MARKETs and relaunch No Carne STREET all of which will lead to No Carne COMMUNITY, our non-profit community organization. The vision for our Indiegogo Campaign is to raise funds to grow the company, to then have these businesses fund the non-profit. We strongly believe with your help we can make this vision a reality!

We have a variety of things available immediately after contributing, such as pins, hats and t-shirts, and groceries/food products for those that live in or near The Bronx, NYC.

Check out our full list of Perks for more info!

<b>1. Improving the quality of pictures</b> : the current resolution level is acceptable, but we still feel the need to improve the quality of product images in the customizing page.</blockquote><blockquote>

<b>3. Adding more brands and product lineup </b>: so far we've managed to create functioning webpage for customizing, but only for 1 brand and 1 category (handbag), while 2 brands are already in line. We need to construct customizing page for more brands and products!</blockquote><blockquote>
<b>4. Interactive functions</b> : CRESTY already has unique features not only from conceptual, but also from functional standpoint. Regardless, we have some great ideas to make CRESTY more enjoyable and user-friendly. These additional functions require extra development.</blockquote><blockquote>
<b>5. Incorporation</b> :  we don't intend to keep CRESTY as project. We want to make CRESTY as legitimate and sustainable business so that we can pursue our vision to spread and stem creative life on a global scale. But the incorporation calls for setting up a necessary team to maintain stable operation on a daily basis.</blockquote><blockquote>

<h4 style=""font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;"">2. Limited and exclusive items</h4>
<div>Monnaluna developed a limited and exclusive collection entitled ""Fiorini Florentia"" only for this campaign!</div>
<h4>""Fiorini Florentia"" -- As a brand heavily laced with Florentine aesthetic, Monnaluna looks into design archive and history of Florence. There, they found numbers of iconic designs but the emblem engraved on the currency (coin) and the angel caught their special attention.  While the emblem symbolizes the flourishing economy and prosperity of Florence during the Renaissance period, the angel symbolizes blessing and profuseness. And these symbols represent, in Monnaluna's vision, what used to be, and still connoted in Florence. </h4>
<h4>The collection boasts antiquated texture with bold use of iconic Florentine symbols. But with the carefully selected and fabricated components, you will see that the total design of each item is contemporary. </h4>

<div>
<blockquote> <b>1. Consistency</b> : we take pride in how the sample-webpage  for customizing turned out. And we are confident that the digital coloration and texture are very close to the  attributes of actual materials. Still, we acknowledge that we can continue to improve the consistency between the two. That being said, we would like you to accept that there may be a minor difference in color and texture between the digital images and the actual items.</blockquote>
<blockquote>As the nature of MTO (made-to-order) and handmade aspect of the manufacturing, there can be very minor inconsistencies between similar products. Again, we would like you to accept and understand that this is NOT manufacturing defect, but the inevitable result of our high value added process.</blockquote>
<blockquote> <b>2. Material</b> : Italian artisans are very particular about the quality. This philosophy and stance result in using the best material possible. But the best material--specifically the best leather are not always wrinkle, stain, or scar free. While our products ensure the use of the best quality leather, you may see a minor wrinkle, stain, or scar. This is the result of the artisans' preference to use the best material as opposed to the ""cleanest"" with lower quality. </blockquote>
<blockquote>Nevertheless, please be minded that our products are fully inspected based on our high quality control standard before the shipment. Therefore, what you are likely to see are limited to very minor wrinkle, stain, or scar.</blockquote>
<blockquote> <b>3. Delivery delay</b>: while we do our very best to deliver the item within 2 months after the completion of this campaign, there can be an occurrence of unavoidable crisis causing the delay. In the face of such case, we will be sure to inform you the delivery status, provide revised delivery date, and complete the delivery.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<b>4. Discount %</b>:  as you can see from the perks, you can get our products at lower price than the estimated retail price in this campaign. However, we still have to consider variable factors (such as exchange rate) for finalizing the retail price. Therefore, please be aware that the articulated discount % in this campaign against the estimated retail price may fluctuate based on the possible change in the final retail price.</blockquote>

</div></div>","Our story

We are facing constraints in everyday
shopping, where we have no other choice but to select from what is available in
the market.



But what if we can create more options for ourselves?
What if we can actively participate in what we buy from creative standpoint? We
are no longer bounded by the limited options, and most of all we are given a
chance to be more creative in our everyday life!





To materialize this idea, we decided to create new online platform named ""CRESTY.""   

About CRESTY

CRESTY = CREate + STYle is the first mall-type online shopping site that carries ONLY CUSTOMIZABLE luxurious goods from all around the world. We believe that CRESTY not only free us from boredom and constrains in everyday shopping, but it also stems and fosters creativity in our daily life. We envision the world where people become more creative on a cultural level, and lead happier life through creating what they want, instead of forcibly purchase what is available.

Features
1. Unique products with a highest quality We only carry relatively UNKNOWN BRANDS, but with the highest quality possible, sophisticated design, and unique background stories.




Our brands boast a manufacturing process that is as close as it gets to handmade (IN ITALY, for our initial lineup). This adds higher value to the products and vastly increase the quality level.2. Intuitive user interface with many customize optionsUI is very straight forward and intuitively playable.


There are 17 variations in leather per customizable parts, 4  colors in metal components, 12 options in jewelry, and 16 colors for crystal. In rough estimation there are 832 to 49,051,392 patterns for the customizing.

(materials are procured from the finest tannery and fabricator in Italy)3. Reasonable pricing
A lot of customizing option, MTO (made-to-order), handmade in Italy; these three factors are what make product luxurious and therefore, very expensive. But in CRESTY, you will see that the price points are very reasonable.
Current status and ongoing challengesWe are international team of business professionals, web designers, creators, brand owners, and manufacturers united under the same vision.


We've come as far as developing 3 brands (manufacturers) from Italy, and constructed functioning sample-webpage for customizing (for 1 brand).But to move forward and complete the platform, there are critical challenges to overcome. It is imperative that we overcome these challenges for starting off the service!




1. Improving the quality of pictures : the current resolution level is acceptable, but we still feel the need to improve the quality of product images in the customizing page.
2. Website development : at this point we only have functioning webpage for customizing. We still need to develop an actual EC site for officially releasing the service.
3. Adding more brands and product lineup : so far we've managed to create functioning webpage for customizing, but only for 1 brand and 1 category (handbag), while 2 brands are already in line. We need to construct customizing page for more brands and products!
4. Interactive functions : CRESTY already has unique features not only from conceptual, but also from functional standpoint. Regardless, we have some great ideas to make CRESTY more enjoyable and user-friendly. These additional functions require extra development.
5. Incorporation :  we don't intend to keep CRESTY as project. We want to make CRESTY as legitimate and sustainable business so that we can pursue our vision to spread and stem creative life on a global scale. But the incorporation calls for setting up a necessary team to maintain stable operation on a daily basis.
6. Setting up a space in the shop : we would like to try out O2O (offline to online) approach using the space in the shop. One of our partnered brands agreed to let us use a part of their shop in Italy with a minor renovation!
7. Boost marketing activities : we are planning to exhibit CRESTY in various fashion & technology related events in different countries. This is to expose the service to wider audience, while conveying our message to change the world for good! Stretch goal




(*any amount less than $30K will be used for keeping the project alive.)
We will unlock more PERKS as the campaign progresses to the next phase!


Development plan
The plan aligns with the stretch goal. Therefore, we will constantly update you with the plan as the campaign progresses!

2. Limited and exclusive items
Monnaluna developed a limited and exclusive collection entitled ""Fiorini Florentia"" only for this campaign!
""Fiorini Florentia"" -- As a brand heavily laced with Florentine aesthetic, Monnaluna looks into design archive and history of Florence. There, they found numbers of iconic designs but the emblem engraved on the currency (coin) and the angel caught their special attention.  While the emblem symbolizes the flourishing economy and prosperity of Florence during the Renaissance period, the angel symbolizes blessing and profuseness. And these symbols represent, in Monnaluna's vision, what used to be, and still connoted in Florence. 
The collection boasts antiquated texture with bold use of iconic Florentine symbols. But with the carefully selected and fabricated components, you will see that the total design of each item is contemporary. 

Necklace

Length: 60cm heart dimension 2cm x 2 cm (all others as above)

Bracelet

Length: 20cm round fiorino coin diameter 2 cm large angel wingspan 18 mm and 25mm tall small angel wingspan approx 18mm and height 15mm



Ring



Fiorino diameter 2 cm and open ended band

    Risks & Challenges

 1. Consistency : we take pride in how the sample-webpage  for customizing turned out. And we are confident that the digital coloration and texture are very close to the  attributes of actual materials. Still, we acknowledge that we can continue to improve the consistency between the two. That being said, we would like you to accept that there may be a minor difference in color and texture between the digital images and the actual items.
As the nature of MTO (made-to-order) and handmade aspect of the manufacturing, there can be very minor inconsistencies between similar products. Again, we would like you to accept and understand that this is NOT manufacturing defect, but the inevitable result of our high value added process.
 2. Material : Italian artisans are very particular about the quality. This philosophy and stance result in using the best material possible. But the best material--specifically the best leather are not always wrinkle, stain, or scar free. While our products ensure the use of the best quality leather, you may see a minor wrinkle, stain, or scar. This is the result of the artisans' preference to use the best material as opposed to the ""cleanest"" with lower quality. 
Nevertheless, please be minded that our products are fully inspected based on our high quality control standard before the shipment. Therefore, what you are likely to see are limited to very minor wrinkle, stain, or scar.
 3. Delivery delay: while we do our very best to deliver the item within 2 months after the completion of this campaign, there can be an occurrence of unavoidable crisis causing the delay. In the face of such case, we will be sure to inform you the delivery status, provide revised delivery date, and complete the delivery.

4. Discount %:  as you can see from the perks, you can get our products at lower price than the estimated retail price in this campaign. However, we still have to consider variable factors (such as exchange rate) for finalizing the retail price. Therefore, please be aware that the articulated discount % in this campaign against the estimated retail price may fluctuate based on the possible change in the final retail price.
   
Other Ways You Can Help Other than claiming the perks, here are some other ways you can help us out!
1. Spread the word!
Feel free to ask us for any pictures or images from CRESTY so that you can spread them through your facebook, twitter, pinterest, etc., for a viral effect.
(With a $ 1 donation, we will engrave your name or preferred alias/title upon our website, as shown in one of the perks!)
2. Write about CRESTY!
If you are a blogger or writer, please write an article about our campaign. If we can measure the referrals and verify that your article brought a lot of people to our campaign, we just might give you a SAMPLE PRODUCT FOR FREE!

<p>It's difficult to find place in Claremont that truly focuses on specialty coffee defined by quality and taste. Not only do I miss well-crafted coffee, I also wish there were more awareness of the many factors, from bean to cup, that influence the taste of what we drink.</p>

<p>The first goal of Espresso Manifesto will to provide my ass-busting Mudd peers with tasty and artful coffee<strong> at no cost.</strong> The second goal is to encourage discussion on what is in the cup, where it comes from, how it is roasted and what makes one coffee different from another.</p>
<p>To get this espresso bar started, I will need a little help from you, my fellow coffee lovers. The funds raised will help cover costs of initial supplies as well as purchasing weekly, freshly roasted coffee beans.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey there, we are Luke Bentley and Lance Linderman founders of Driftwood Coffee Co.  We want to THANK YOU so much for visiting our IndieGoGo page and for supporting us.  Here is our story and what we are all about!</p>
<p>We love everything coffee, the unique brewing methods, different tastes, relaxing or working hard in our favorite coffee shops, but most importantly the way that coffee brings us together.  This is why we want to start Driftwood and we believe there is a unique opportunity to do this in Old Town Peoria. Our desire is to bring the craft style coffee that so many of you enjoy downtown to the west-side. Peoria is our home, it's our roots and yours too!  How awesome would it be to have a place on the west side that we can all be proud of and call our own, a place we can all use to create and dream?  The void for quality craft coffee is real in Peoria and we want to help fill that. Downtown Peoria is an old community with good architecture and is just waiting for someone to do something different. With your help we can easily make this happen and we want you to be involved. This is why we are doing this campaign. Thank you again for considering to be apart of this, we promise every cup will be worth it!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As you can imagine opening a coffee shop is no easy task, especially financially. We are in a unique position because we will be renting a space from Axiom Venue which plans to house everything from a coffee shop (US!) to local and national touring acts, business conferences and a church that will gather there on Sundays.  Having this wide variety of people coming through and a building to call home puts us in a great starting position. However there is still a lot to be done, like building out the space to fit who we are, equipping it with commercial grade equipment, securing an architect, start up product, a website, licensing and so much more. Driftwood wants to be a place that you can meet your friends or coworkers at, see local art and musicians, and most of all deliver a quality cup of coffee that feeds your addiction. In order to do this we need 25,000 dollars. This might seem like a lot however this is just over half of the money we need to be fully operational and just enough to begin. If you look at the brief summary below you can see our desired outcome is $45,000.  The money you give will go straight to the shop, with it we will buy things like tables, espresso machines, lights, and comfy seats that don’t hurt your butt after 15 min of sitting in. If you look at the donation packaging options you will see some really cool stuff too! We are offering things like Cold Brew, t-shirts, Driftwood koozies, and even original artwork by our good friend D. Roy Brubaker! For donating you will also receive an invitation to our soft opening party!! We believe that it is in our best interest to engage you the community and ask for your help. If you believe in Old Town Peoria and the potential it has to bring will you consider helping us?</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution is so valuable to us and will help us get in the building faster. Not only do you get the sweet packages we have prepared but you also get to know that you helped us accomplish something that is so necessary for Peoria. Think about the conversations you’ve had with your friends over a cup of coffee. I know for us there have been amazing positive conversations and even terribly awkward breakups that have happened over a cup of delicious coffee. At Driftwood we would love to be a part of those stories.</p>
<p>We know we are new to the coffee shop ownership world but we have help. Our main source of wisdom comes from Kris Robison who is our primary consultant and has a vast amount of experience and knowledge in this field having managed and consulted some of the best Cartel, Jobots &amp; Morning Moonshine.  Christoph Kaiser our architect has designed Changing Hands at the Newton, Welcome Diner and much more.  Lance has ran his own design and print company for many years and with great success. Although Luke has never run a business he has worked in the coffee industry for years and has successfully campaigned a T-shirt Kickstarter company. We are all in, and we want you to be a part of the history of Driftwood.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Owning any business is a huge risk. Yet there is a great amount of reward that can come with it. Although we are new to this kind of business model and scale, we know we have outside support  who have talented gifts that we can utilize. One risk is the area we are preparing to move into. It is mostly abandoned and it’s a part of town that has been forgotten by most entrepreneurs. Our goal is to bring life into this area but that can only happen if people are willing to venture down and see us. There has been a huge support already, and we aren’t the first business to go into this area. There is a new distillery down there called Lucidis, and we will be right next to the Peoria government buildings. With a strong marketing campaign and a little help from our friends we will be able to make the business profitable. Another challenge we face is the finances of this operation. We don’t personally have the full amount to invest into this operation on our own, but we have invested a lot of time and are working hard to find ways to come up with more. As silly as it sounds we have done things like sell our apple watches just so we can pay for the expenses that come with even starting a business and hiring a consultant. Anything short of our goal we will have to seek through other means via a business loan or through personal investors. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Money isn’t the only way you can help, but every dollar is helpful! Even sharing our project with your friends can increase awareness so that others can know about our desire for a craft coffee shop in Peoria. There are sharing tools on our page so every post to Facebook or Instagram means A LOT! We hope you are just as excited as we are to be open and we are always humbled by our friends and family’s generosity. THANKS!</p>

<p>My name is Randy Vaughn I just turned 60 years old this past spring.</p>
<p>Something you need to know about me right up front is that I am a hardworking, honest and compassionate person. I live in a small town in the Midwest, Henderson, KY, where we still hold true the values that built this country.......where a man’s handshake is his bond.  </p>
<p>    Our community, like many others in small towns throughout this country, has been invaded by the large box stores such as Walmart, Lowes, K-Mart. The result of this influx has been the demise of local mom and pop small business owners. Only a few remain.</p>
<p>   Henderson is a beautiful town that sits on the banks of the Ohio River. The potential to create a thriving downtown district is unlimited. Sadly the local business community and Financial Institutions lack the vision, passion and courage it takes to turn things around.</p>
<p>   I have been a musician for 51 years. I started playing drums at the age of 9 and through the years learned piano, guitar and vocals.   But despite my passion for music I learned early in life that my primary responsibility was to support and care for my family. I was fortunate enough at an early age I learned I had to balance my life between what I loved to do ........and what I had to do.</p>
<p>   In the spring of 2011 I purchased, at an auction, a three story building located  in the downtown business district.  Sadly to say this was a local mom and pop Hardware Store that had been in business for 4 generations. The building originally was a manufacturing facility for John Deer Buggies and Carriages. Later after the introduction of the automobile it was converted into a furniture manufacturing plant by George Delker. Hence the name ……….” Delkers”</p>
<p> My plans were to open a Music Venue/Eatery. A place of retirement where I could meet with friends , play music and enjoy what years I had left when and if  that retirement date came.</p>
<p>    Up to this point in my life I had worked since the age of 13. Yes I started playing drums in local Honky Tonks at an early age. Throughout the next 40 some odd years I was a salesman. Through various changes of employment I sold Audio Video products, Plumbing Supplies, Fasteners and cars. I eventually became a Industrial  Product Support Specialist ……..(fancy name for Salesman) This became my  means of support for my family up until the fall of 2014 when I injured  my  knee on a jobsite while employed with a very large corporation out of New Bremen,OH …….I was 58 at the time. Needless to say after my injury I was viewed by my employer as a liability and , as my attorney put it, it was just a matter of time before they found a way to dispose of me.  One thing you should know about my work history is that prior to my termination I was Salesman of the year in my division for 2012 , 2013 and in 2014 and I was in the running to win it for the third consecutive year. I was the top producer over other territories such as Cincinnati, Indianapolis, Louisville and Lexington that were two to three times the size of my territory. After having knee surgery I returned to work with light duty. I was put on display in the office and was assigned the degrading task of removing staples from documents , scanning them, and then refiling them. I did this for 8 weeks.  I was eventually allowed to return to my original position in outside sales. But with expectations and sales quota’s that the company and I both knew were unattainable.  Little did I know that over the next three months the company was monitoring my emails, text messages, voicemails, phone calls and tracking my location daily with GPS. After those three months I was called into a meeting and was put through a 2-hour inquisition by five different individuals in management and was terminated. I was terminated on small technicalities such as inaccuracies in my call reports and conflicting dates and times. They knew this was my weak point because I have ADHD. Previously I had stated that I was assigned sales quota’s that were looked upon as unreachable. Well the ironic thing about it is that at the time of this inquisition my sales numbers were 25% OVER quota and were on track to be 43% over the assigned goal at the end of the month. I brought this to the attention of my supervisor and I was told very bluntly “ We are not here to discuss your sales numbers.”</p>
<p>  At that point the Music Venue I had been working on went from being a retirement project to my only means of income. My wife had just retired from a position at the local newspaper after 34 years.</p>
<p>    Our personal investment to this point has been well over $250,000.00  I have since sold a custom  Harley Davidson Motorcycle, a Vintage 1963 Volkswagon Bus, rental property, various musical equipment and instruments  and have totally depleted our retirement fund.</p>
<p>    I have somehow survived the first two years but it has financially drained me to the point that I have been forced to seek outside assistance. Believe me when I say .....this is not an easy thing for me to do.  .</p>
<p>For me to have worked so hard and get this far just to have it all slip away would surely leave a permanent scar on me emotionally.</p>

</div></div>","My name is Randy Vaughn I just turned 60 years old this past spring.
Something you need to know about me right up front is that I am a hardworking, honest and compassionate person. I live in a small town in the Midwest, Henderson, KY, where we still hold true the values that built this country.......where a man’s handshake is his bond.  
    Our community, like many others in small towns throughout this country, has been invaded by the large box stores such as Walmart, Lowes, K-Mart. The result of this influx has been the demise of local mom and pop small business owners. Only a few remain.
   Henderson is a beautiful town that sits on the banks of the Ohio River. The potential to create a thriving downtown district is unlimited. Sadly the local business community and Financial Institutions lack the vision, passion and courage it takes to turn things around.
   I have been a musician for 51 years. I started playing drums at the age of 9 and through the years learned piano, guitar and vocals.   But despite my passion for music I learned early in life that my primary responsibility was to support and care for my family. I was fortunate enough at an early age I learned I had to balance my life between what I loved to do ........and what I had to do.

<h1>Summary </h1>
<p>Cider's popularity has been skyrocketing the last few years. While supermarket shelves are overflowing with options for sweet, inexpensive mid- to low-grade cider, real, dry cider made with the right kind of apples is still hard to come by. The most common complaint I still hear about cider is that it's too sweet. Well, we're making fully dry, wild fermented, barrel aged cider. Our emphasis is on the apples. You won't see an array of flavored ciders like cherry, hopped, or whatever coming from Lassen Traditional Cidery. When you use the right kind of apples, you don't have to add other flavors to it! The apples are amazing on their own! You wouldn't adulterate a fine wine by adding other flavors to it, so why do it to quality cider? So what do we mean by the ""right"" apples? Well, true bittersweet and bittersharp cider varieties are grown in France and England, but are extremely rare in the US. Historically, what we call heirloom apples are what were used for cider in the US. These are seedling apples that were discovered and selectively propagated and have a unique history in our country. These old-time varieties were once somewhat common, but apple diversity has slowly faded away and sales of homogeneous, mass produced common dessert apples have long taken over nationwide apples sales. We are focused on finding orchards growing these heirloom varieties for use in our cider. Some examples of the varieties we use include King David, Winesap, Newtown Pippin, Arkansas Black, and Jonathan. These apples don't necessarily have the high tannin levels present in the European cider apples, but they do have amazing aromatic flavors that result in delicious cider. Our cidermaking methods are reminiscent of how cider was made a hundred years ago, thus the reason for the word traditional appearing in our name. We do a wild fermentation in oak barrels, contributing a rustic complexity that is hard to find in most currently available ciders.<br/></p>
<p>Lassen Traditional Cider was founded by Ben Nielsen. Ben's
love of fermentation began when he started brewing beer in college. After
brewing extensively for his adult life, around 2005 he began delving into cider
in an effort to use the free fruit from a neighbor's backyard apples trees in
Corvallis, OR. After a couple years, this morphed into an annual cider pressing
party where all his friends would bring apples to press or just help out. So of
course, the neighbor's apples weren't enough after a while. Unused trees in
yards all over town, unseen apple trees in the ditch on the side of a country
road, and long forgotten pioneer orchards were all sought out and utilized. A
major revelation occurred when a batch of cider was produced from crab apples,
and it ended up being the best he'd ever made. So, some apples that were so
astringent as to be seemingly inedible actually made delicious cider. After
this, an effort was undertaken to seek out varieties of apples that were good
for cider instead of scavenging whatever was available. <span>Finding
 Nick Botner's orchard in Yoncalla, OR, with over 4,000 apple varieties,
 was a godsend, allowing Ben to experiment with single varietal ciders 
made from unusual apples, from European bittersharps and bittersweets to
 an array of American heirlooms. </span>Around 2012, when the
cider craze was beginning to kick into high gear and Ben's satisfaction with
his engineering job was waning in the opposite direction, he began to give more
thought to starting his own cidery. A timely layoff in 2014 pushed him more in
that direction. After spending a winter skiing and soul searching, the decision
was solidified and the plan was put in place in mid 2015. Most of a year was
spent finding a location and undertaking the permit process. Although he's
still learning how to be a businessman, he has a lot of pride in his cider. Now
here we are ready for you to enjoy the fruits of our labor.</p>

</h1>We need your help getting us off the ground! I've already invested $40,000 of my own money establishing the business. I've been going through the permit process for a painstaking 8 months and I'm almost legal. During the harvest season this year I'm planning on being ready to go to make a larger amount of cider to sell to the masses.

<div>
<p>Hi, my name is Matt.  I have spent the last 15 years managing a pizza shop and know the ins and outs of getting what people want to them, how, where, and when they want or need it. </p>
<p>I’m trying to start a food delivery business servicing
Pittsburgh and the surrounding areas. 
This is a much needed business in the Pittsburgh area that I anticipate
will do very well.  Similar services are already
offered in other cities. </p>

You're at home and hungry as hell, but you don’t
have a car, or maybe you just don’t feel like leaving your home. Currently, your
only options for meal delivery are pizza or Chinese food.  Don’t get me wrong, I’m not knocking pizza or
Chinese food, but there are times (many times) when you just want all food options available,
and that’s where my delivery service comes in. I would like to have my service to be like Uber but instead of picking up people from one place to another it will be food and to expand that to groceries and whatever else somebody may need from a store.<br/>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p><br/></p> <ul> <li>I need starting capital for a website website to store every menu in the Pittsburgh and Surrounding Pittsburgh Area and to have that site so the customer can order whatever they want from wherever they want.

</div></div>","Short Summary

Hi, my name is Matt.  I have spent the last 15 years managing a pizza shop and know the ins and outs of getting what people want to them, how, where, and when they want or need it. 
I’m trying to start a food delivery business servicing
Pittsburgh and the surrounding areas. 
This is a much needed business in the Pittsburgh area that I anticipate
will do very well.  Similar services are already
offered in other cities. 

You're at home and hungry as hell, but you don’t
have a car, or maybe you just don’t feel like leaving your home. Currently, your
only options for meal delivery are pizza or Chinese food.  Don’t get me wrong, I’m not knocking pizza or
Chinese food, but there are times (many times) when you just want all food options available,
and that’s where my delivery service comes in. I would like to have my service to be like Uber but instead of picking up people from one place to another it will be food and to expand that to groceries and whatever else somebody may need from a store.
   What We Need & What You Get   I need starting capital for a website website to store every menu in the Pittsburgh and Surrounding Pittsburgh Area and to have that site so the customer can order whatever they want from wherever they want. To do it right I would also need to have apps for all phone and tablet OS's. On top of having the opportunity of helping launch this unique and much needed service to the Pittsburgh Area. I plan on sending investors Bring Me Grub Hoodies, T-Shirts, and Key Chains. Even if funding falls short of our goal I plan on using what I get to go full speed ahead and make due with whatever people are generous enough to give.    The Impact This service can revolutionize the restaurant and food industry.  There is no other service like this in the city so the sky is the limit and possibilities are endless and there is no competition in the area to content with.    Risks & Challenges There are always risks when stepping out of your normal safe day to day life to take a chance on something new and daunting. My idea has very little risk and the biggest challenge will be man power and the interactive app with all the menus.   I have a lot of experience in this industry and know what it takes to pull this off. I am the one on the ground pounding the pavement and talking to the owners to get on board and gathering all of the information and cooperation I can get.    Other Ways You Can Help If you're not in the position to donate any money I only ask that you can spread the word of my service whether it be to get people to that could donate to this project or just to get the word of mouth out once the business launches.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div><p>Hello, my name is Paul McMenemy. I edit a magazine called <i><a href=""http://www.lunarpoetry.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lunar
Poetry</a></i>. I am looking to establish a dedicated poetry bookshop in London
as there currently isn’t one. In fact, as far as I know there is only one
poetry bookshop in the whole of the UK, in <a href=""http://www.poetrybookshop.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hay-on-Wye</a>. [Edit: I have now found out that there is also one in Glasgow: <a href=""https://tellitslantbookshop.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tell It Slant</a> - do check it out.] This is rather out of
the way for most people, and I don’t think that poetry is something you should
have to go on a special pilgrimage to experience, but something that should be
easily accessible to as many people as possible.</p>
<p>Most new poetry in the UK is published by small presses
whose work never makes into most bookshops; often it isn’t even very easy to
find online, only being accessible through the publishers’ own websites. As
there are hundreds of these (the <a href=""http://www.poetrylibrary.org.uk/publishers/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Saison Poetry Library website</a>
lists over a hundred currently active small presses and around the same number
of little magazines in Britain) there is no way, even for someone with an
active interest in modern poetry, to keep track of all this stuff. And for
someone who is looking to find their way into poetry for the first time, this
confusion of tiny presses makes it almost impossible to do so.</p>
<p>I want a bookshop and website which gathers as much of this
poetry together as possible in one place – a comfortable place you don’t feel
like you need to have a special password to get into. The <i><a href=""http://www.poetrybookfair.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Free Verse poetry book fair</a></i> has shown that if
you can do this, people will come, and will buy poetry. But again, I don’t think
poetry is something you should have to set aside a special fund for, in order
to have an annual splurge – I think it ought to be something that, if you have
a spare fiver or so in your pocket come payday, you ought to be able to pop in
somewhere and pick up something on a whim.</p>
<p><a href=""http://iklectikartlab.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">I’klectik Art Lab</a>
in central London have agreed to let us have a space inside their venue in
order to set up a shop of this kind. I’klectik is a gallery, café and
performance space about ten minutes from Waterloo station, the Saison Poetry
Library and the Poetry School. They currently host a monthly Spoken Word night,
<i><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/silencefoundatongue"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Silence Found a Tongue</a></i>,
and have previously held launch nights for <i>Lunar
Poetry</i>.</p>
<p>We are looking for at least £5,000 to cover our initial rent,
wages, furnishing costs and stock – this last item will account for the
majority of the cash. In return, we are offering – as well as the chance to contribute
to something I hope you feel is worthwhile – subscriptions to and copies of <i>Lunar Poetry</i> and various other
forthcoming Lunar publications (including some special limited edition work), the
opportunity to take part in workshops for both adults and children, free
tickets to performances and other chances to be a part of the bookshop in one
way or another. If you can’t help with cash just now, please spread the word
and help us reach as many people as possible.</p>
<p>Poetry is often seen as irrelevant. This is not true. Poetry
is, though, at the moment, invisible. Having a dedicated space where poetry can
be treated, not as a special, delicate flower which has to be sheltered from
the cruel world, but as something which can be bought, sold, experienced, handled,
discussed and enjoyed just like anything else – where poetry is a real thing
interacting with the real world – is a step towards making it visible. If you
already have an interest in poetry, I hope you can see why this is worth doing.
Even if you don’t much care for poetry, hopefully you’ll agree that anything
which makes art in any form more widely available (and other artforms are
currently far more easily accessed than poetry) contributes to the richness of
our cultural life – and, you never know, the Lunar Poetry Bookshop might just be the<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> thing to change your mind.</span></p>

<div>Hi.  My name is Tesea Dawson, ex-member of Tuatha Dea, still active as a promoter/manager for the band and now currently an event coordinator.  I have toured and lived in the festival scene for the last five years.  During that time I have become extremely familiar with the ins and outs of these types of events.  Back in April of 2015 I coordinated BEF Full Moon &amp; Spring Celebration.  A small and intimate outdoor festival with success, i'm currently involved with coordinating and production of several other small fundraisers and events and am now seeking to take on larger endeavors.  Something I have noticed at these events is that they are targeted to one specific audience.  Well, I'm all about the idea of coexisting.  We are all unique in our own way and most of us are just plain weird.  I think we should celebrate that.  As requested I've set a date for April 2016.  Tentatively April 1-3 at The Hotel Preston in Nashville, TN.  </div>
<div>Being that this is a first time event we need a boost to get it off the ground.  I wanna bring everyone together.  No matter your race, creed, religions, sex, age, sexual orientation or status, I want to create a place we can all come together for one weekend and embrace each others differences.</div>
<div>ODD Con... Original, Diverse, Different.  </div>
<div>Given the world's current state it is extremely important to show the world that we can coexist.  It's time to let go of the stigmas placed on us.  In keeping with that ideal... ODD Con is setting the stage for something larger... A future project called The Humanity Experiment.  A documentary about civil rights and the problems humanity faces today.  It is the hope that it will raise awareness and show the world we need to change.  A wake up call.  </div>
<div>As a contributor to this campaign you will make this idea a reality.  Starting a revolution in the hearts and minds so to speak!  Bringing us all together under one roof for two days of acceptance!  And how will we celebrate our differences?  How bout The Weirdo's Ball featuring internationally touring band Tuatha Dea!  Or show us your favorite game, comic or anime character in the Cosplay Contest!  Into the living dead?  Then get all gored up and enter the Zombie Pin-Up Beauty Pageant!  Wanna just shop?  Check out our insane variety at vendors row.  Music freak?  Stick around for all the live acts.  How bout the Artists Spotlight Gallery for local artists and craftsmen?  We should always show support for local art!  Don't forget about many workshops, presenters and fan Q&amp;A Panels with your favorite band, author or community leaders!  So much is being put into this and with the idea in mind of bringing everyone together!  Lastly, your contribution will go toward bringing awareness to the The Humanity Experiment and hopefully gain support and sponsorship for the project.</div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>Truth is it's impossible to know the exact amount we will need.  But we want to be able to bring the best to you.  In order to do that we have to secure the location of the venue and take care of our performers and guests who are there to share their time with all of us.  The money you donate will help pay the travel expenses, boarding, feeding and make sure they don't walk away empty handed.  After all they're all artists too and this is how they make their living.  They are giving us a gift of their talents, knowledge and time to be there.  This ensures we can do that.</div>
<div>But you won't give something for nothing...

My oldest is  Jr. at U of O on a academic scholarship and my son is a Master at Arms in the Navy. I have a sophomore in high school  earning 4.0, playing football, basketball, enrolled in student counsel, and working 25 hours a week washing dishes and babysitting my rambunctious 4 year old. We are diamonds in the rough fighting poverty through education and hard work. I bought a run down food cart 4 years ago and have been trickling cash into it ever since. I started Irie Shave & Crave LLC,  a mobile shave ice/ decadent dessert food trailer specializing in the event market, to help make ends meet.    I am ready to open in a week but my funds are exhausted. We are I pray for any financial help to help secure events in the near future so my business can stay afloat.  Irie is a green company and we also would love some help to add solar panels for energy independence and a small A/C unit for safety. (It get's HOT in there!) I am a fantastic, proud mother. I have worked my fingers to the bone to provide for my family, though it was not always enough. Irie Shave & Crave LLC. is how I plan to rise above poverty and better support my amazing family.

</div></div>","Users will visit the site or the mobile app and see content that includes short videos with a social message, information about charitable organizations and businesses, or other positive, uplifting news from around the world.


By simply visiting and viewing the content, the users will be supporting these organizations through advertising revenue collected and donated.

                                                We’re a team with a plan: to make the world a better place.  We work outside the realm of politics and nationalities in order to create change on a human level, but we realized we can’t do it on our own. 


So we’ve created the “Philanthropy Network Service,” a platform that will include a web service and mobile application, available for everyone on any device, from simply those who want to help to the heads of charitable organizations and businesses pushing social change, aid and philanthropy. 


As more people join our project and use our platform, sharing their successes and their stories, the desire to help and lend a hand will spread, and together we will be able to realize an international society of likeminded people.




Culture of philanthropy will be created using positive and life-affirming social videos:


- good cauntionary movie
- presentations of charities
- projects and campaigns video reports
- announcements of world’s good news and  events
                                        

                     

                         



                        
                          
We believe that in order to develop a culture of philanthropy across the world, we need to change the collective mentality of doom and gloom that hangs over so many.  By creating one platform to bring together those with a heart to help with the organizations and businesses that promote and back positive social movements and charitable projects, we are creating a community of people who are ready to make change.


                                       For many, charity carries a certain stigma or level of doubt.  You worry about where your money is going, you question the motives of those you’re helping, and in the end decide it’s better to keep your time and money to yourself than to put it in the wrong hands.  In many cases, people simply aren’t aware of the real work these organizations and movements do, or even that they exist!  Our service will work to inform.

The goal of our project is to create a society of people who support each other in philanthropic aims. 
                                    You see someone help, you want to help. 
                                    You catch the charity bug, and it spreads.
                               
                                  Users will be able to help not only through donations and deed, but also by simply using the platform.


                      Our platform will operate under the idea of “2 minutes to help.”  

 In countries across the world, people spend an average of over 300 minutes in front of a screen daily.  If everyone put just two of these minutes to charitable use, it would have the potential to bring about real positive change.



                                                                         *  Mary Meeker’s 2014 internet trends report

                        
Research shows that it takes 66 days to form a habit.  To make a habit out of charity, our application will include a reminder feature, which the users can set to any time that is convenient for them!  Standing in line for coffee, riding the bus, waiting for your food, you can make a difference anywhere and everywhere!



                        Users will visit the site or the mobile app and see content that includes short videos with a social message, information about charitable organizations and businesses, or other positive, uplifting news from around the world.



By simply visiting and viewing the content, the users will be supporting these organizations through advertising revenue collected and donated.


                           




                              With social network sharing features included, the Philanthropy Network Service makes it easy to tell your friends about the good work you’re doing.  We also hope that, with the help of our service, charity can become a habit, an important and necessary part of everyday life.
                            
                                           Fostering a habit starts at home, so share it with your family, where every generation can work together to support and spread a growing culture of charity and philanthropy.

                             
                                        
The users decides what to support.  As money is collected, they can choose to what areas of charity they want to send their contributions. 

                            

                                         All are also welcome to quickly, conveniently, and safely contribute to any projects that they would like to personally support. 

                             

                           Organizations will be able to announce events, which users will see and can choose to attend or volunteer.  Businesses will be able to advertise their own events as well; a restaurant owner can spread the word about a special night where proceeds go to charitable projects.
                          

                                  
                                * The supervisory board is intended to provide a monitoring role.A Supervisory Board of invited philanthropists and contributors will help to decide and plan the areas of charity we will work with.


                              
                       

                      
""Social responsibility is an ethical framework which suggests that an entity, be it an organization or individual, has an obligation to act for the benefit of society at large.""


                                                
Social responsibility is a duty every individual has to perform so as to maintain a balance among the economy, society and the ecosystems.


 A trade-off may exist between economic development, in the material sense, and the welfare of the society and environment.
Social responsibility means sustaining the equilibrium between the two.
This responsibility can be passive, by avoiding engaging in socially harmful acts, or active, by performing activities that directly advance social goals.

                        

                                 




     
                    
                     
                       
                     


                             The development of a fully-functional application and all of the factors that go into making it work (testing, running servers, technical support), in addition to the building of a platform of advertisements which will serve as one of the main sources of donation collection, requires a large set of funds. In order to create a worldwide culture of philanthropy, we need to spread the word.  The larger our user base, the more we will be able to help. As the project expands and we develop a complete team, engaging locally in countries around the world, we’re going to need even more support.  This is a project on a global scale, and we need help to make it happen.      




In order to make our project a reality and bring you a simple to use and easy to understand platform, we need to develop a complex set of connections between users, providing them with the information they need regarding local and international charitable opportunities, and to implement a safe and secure method through which users will be able to support projects.



The kind of worldwide change that a platform such as “Philanthropy Network Service” can bring about is the dream of many, our team included, and we want to make this happen together with you.

The response to this tragedy has been overwhelming. However, the needs of Nepal will not fade as quickly as the headlines, and neither should efforts to help. We believe it is critical to begin addressing the need for long-term sustainable, earthquake-resistant housing for the families that have been left homeless. To date over 500,000 homes have been destroyed and another 300,000 are damaged. The most grievous impact has been to village communities - once picturesque, which have now turned into landscapes of suffering. In the near term, the monsoon season is due to start in June, and families will no longer be able to remain in emergency tents. In an effort to beat the monsoon, affected people are hastily rebuilding and support is needed to ensure they build back safer.</p>
<p>As many of you know, Satish and I have committed to building a life in Nepal. After three and a half years we've given birth to our daughter Zoya and have watched our son Manav be embraced and truly thrive in this lovely country. We feel blessed to call this our home. In addition, we are so grateful that our home is intact and all of our loved ones in this large Joshi family remain safe and sheltered. But several people in our lives, such as our driver Purna's village and our lovely Ramila Didi's village are devastated. As a result, it made most sense for us to focus on sustainable reconstruction for these village communities.</p>
<p>SO many of you have asked how you can help, well this is finally it! WE NEED YOUR HELP! We have collected an initial $10,000 that will provide transitional shelters to see families through the monsoon season. And you can help a family in need rebuild a safe, sustainable village home for as less as $1,500!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our priority is to initiate an international fundraising campaign to rebuild 50-100 village homes using the most sustainable eco-friendly and earthquake-resistant methods available in Nepal with local materials and local labor. This will be performed in partnership with Nepal-based organizations with expertise in this type of construction such as:</p>

<p>Our goal is to demonstrate the feasibility and affordability of safe, sustainable and eco-friendly homes using local materials for reconstruction. Communities will be involved throughout the process so that we can utilize local knowledge and expertise, and train members from these villages in the reconstruction process. In addition, families will contribute a nominal percentage towards rebuilding their permanent homes to ensure responsibility and pride of ownership. Our hope is that these village projects will provide successful evidence so that larger international donors and the Government of Nepal will continue funding sustainable reconstruction and scale this up to other impacted communities.</p>

We recognize there is a fine balance between customer engagement and harassment and so we will use our intuitive systems and processes to work very smart with customers.Market Competition:We understand that the online retail space is saturated, however our research tells us that there are key differentiators which will help us to stand out and be set apart in the customers mind. Following extensive research and insight into the online retail market place, we found that a large percentage of failing online retailers, do so because they do not have the correct mix within their business model. We have analysed this and come up with a great solution. Nothing or no company is perfect, but we are pretty close. We understand this to be a huge challenge, but we have an exhaustive strategy and so are confident about stepping into the market place.

Due to our suppliers, sellers and representatives being positioned around the world, we automatically have localized promotion and marketing which adds a great deal of power to our social reach. Understanding the local needs, language and cultural objectives gives us a huge advantage over many retailers, who do not take this into consideration prior to launch.Operational Functionality:Thanks to a highly experienced team, who have worked in the online retail space for many years, we are aware of all of the factors that can present a problem in delivery, shipping, and stocking our business.

<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The total cost of participating in the 8-month social impact strategy program is <b>$7,500</b>. <b>Two thirds ($5,000) of that is tuition</b> and the <b>remainder is the cost of meals, room, and travel</b> to and from Philadelphia for two 3-day workshops in June and December. Since the cohort of 35 students is coming from all over the world, most course instruction and interaction takes place online.</p>
<p> <b>The perks are the best part. </b><br/></p>
<p>For <b>instant gratification</b>, you'll enjoy some perks right along with me as I go through the social impact program. Some examples of the perks you'll enjoy:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Every </i>donor will get an <b>""Impact Point"" in her or his email inbox</b> each week. These will be fascinating lessons or observations I pick up during that week's course work. <br/>
</li>
<li>Some donors will get invitations to <b>private behind-the-scenes meetings and tours</b> with some of the most forward-thinking social impact leaders and projects in Detroitland.</li>
<li>And there will be a <b>big ice cream social</b>, too!<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<b></b><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1181390/files/20150129024428-philadelphia-love-park-aaron-couture.jpg?1422528268"" src="""" style=""width: 238.07px; height: 187px;""/></p>
<br/>The biggest perk is the one where the social impact training pays off for <i>you</i>.  <br/><br/><p>Upon completion of the social impact strategy program, I will commit <b>150 hours of pro bono service</b> to a nonprofit or social impact project <i>you will help choose</i>.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1181391/files/20150129024611-college-photo_8826._445x280-zmm.jpg?1422528371"" src="""" style=""width: 367.125px; height: 231px;""/></p>That's not all. <b>Professors and students from the Rochester College School of Business will join me.</b> That's a lot of hands, hearts, and minds making an impact where you believe it needs to happen most. <br/>
<ul>
<li>Each donor gets to nominate one nonprofit or social impact idea</li>
<li>For every $50 a donor gives to the Impact Social Impact campaign, he or she receives one vote</li>
<li>At the end of the campaign, <b>all donors will vote for the nonprofit or social impact project</b> where the Rochester College School of Business and I will devote hundreds of hours in 2016. <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That's a perk that keeps on perking! <br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>Even if the crowdfunding campaign falls short, I'm committing to this program--even if it means mowing lawns and washing cars to make it happen. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that I'll regret if I let it slip away. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1181385/files/20150129024218-IMG_4343.JPG?1422528138"" src="""" style=""width: 276px; height: 207px;""/></p>
<br/>The biggest challenge besides money is time. As a husband and father and start-up social entrepreneur, time is tight. I'm making some big changes to how I manage time in 2015, starting with the admission that it's not limitless. This is hard for me because I've always wanted to believe that I can do <i>everything</i>. My wife is very good at reminding me of my limits. Now that I'm collaborating with business partners and enjoying the counsel of a business coach and mentors, my expectations and plans are more realistic. Eliminating distractions and pipe dreams from my schedule and listening to the wisdom of those around me is going to make this my best year ever for productivity. That includes the social impact program. <br/><br/>Finally, I'm accountable to you. In addition to the reports I send along the way, you can follow my always-transparent updates on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/btirwin"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/btirwin"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">LinkedIn</a>, <a href=""https://twitter.com/BTIrwin"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a>, and my <a href=""http://btirwin.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website</a>. <br/><br/><b>Any money I raise over the $7,500 fundraising goal will be donated to the nonprofit organization or social impact project that donors choose.</b><br/> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>I'm just like you. That is, organizations and people ask me for money almost every week. If I had a bottomless wallet, I'd give money to every one of them.</p>
<p>So I understand if this is not the right giving opportunity for you right now. <br/></p>
<p>If you believe in what I'm doing and you want to contribute in other ways, would you please consider one of these options? <br/></p> <ul> <li>Book me to share my experience and training in social impact with an audience that you choose.</li>
<li>Contribute money another way: Ask your company, house of worship, nonprofit organization, or school to hire me to assess and develop its community engagement program. I offer one-on-one sessions as short at 20 minutes. <br/>
</li>
<li>Share this campaign with your friends and network (use the convenient Indiegogo sharing tools).</li>

 Thank you for checking out Impact Social Impact. You can be sure that I'll do everything to make every part of this worth your investment.
For my full background, please check out my LinkedIn profile.This ""About Me"" section is really about you. Making the greatest possible difference to as many people and places in the world became my passion when I was still in elementary school. As I grew up and started my career, I struggled to find the one job, organization, or place where I could do my best work to make the world better. While working at Habitat for Humanity a few years ago, it dawned on me: The way to make the greatest possible difference in the world is not about what I do for a job or where I work. It's about helping those around me make the difference they want to make. My personal mission became to educate, equip and empower people to work together to bring to life the promise in the world around them. In 2013, I left my development job at Habitat for Humanity to work full-time helping individuals and organizations do good better. This year, the University of Pennsylvania selected me to join 34 other servant leaders from around the world to participate in an 8-month social impact strategy program. This Ivy League program teaches and trains leaders to educate, equip, and empower communities to transform themselves for the better. Sound familiar? It is a very special honor and privilege to be selected for this program.More important, I believe this program will greatly enhance my knowledge, skills, and wisdom for those trying to make a greater social impact in their communities. This campaign truly is about you (and this guy). 

  What We Need & What You Get The total cost of participating in the 8-month social impact strategy program is $7,500. Two thirds ($5,000) of that is tuition and the remainder is the cost of meals, room, and travel to and from Philadelphia for two 3-day workshops in June and December. Since the cohort of 35 students is coming from all over the world, most course instruction and interaction takes place online.
 The perks are the best part. 
For instant gratification, you'll enjoy some perks right along with me as I go through the social impact program. Some examples of the perks you'll enjoy:


Every donor will get an ""Impact Point"" in her or his email inbox each week. These will be fascinating lessons or observations I pick up during that week's course work. 

Some donors will get invitations to private behind-the-scenes meetings and tours with some of the most forward-thinking social impact leaders and projects in Detroitland.
And there will be a big ice cream social, too!



The biggest perk is the one where the social impact training pays off for you.  Upon completion of the social impact strategy program, I will commit 150 hours of pro bono service to a nonprofit or social impact project you will help choose.

That's not all. Professors and students from the Rochester College School of Business will join me. That's a lot of hands, hearts, and minds making an impact where you believe it needs to happen most. 

Each donor gets to nominate one nonprofit or social impact idea
For every $50 a donor gives to the Impact Social Impact campaign, he or she receives one vote
At the end of the campaign, all donors will vote for the nonprofit or social impact project where the Rochester College School of Business and I will devote hundreds of hours in 2016. 


That's a perk that keeps on perking!    Risks & ChallengesEven if the crowdfunding campaign falls short, I'm committing to this program--even if it means mowing lawns and washing cars to make it happen. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that I'll regret if I let it slip away. 
The biggest challenge besides money is time. As a husband and father and start-up social entrepreneur, time is tight. I'm making some big changes to how I manage time in 2015, starting with the admission that it's not limitless. This is hard for me because I've always wanted to believe that I can do everything. My wife is very good at reminding me of my limits. Now that I'm collaborating with business partners and enjoying the counsel of a business coach and mentors, my expectations and plans are more realistic. Eliminating distractions and pipe dreams from my schedule and listening to the wisdom of those around me is going to make this my best year ever for productivity. That includes the social impact program. Finally, I'm accountable to you. In addition to the reports I send along the way, you can follow my always-transparent updates on Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and my website. Any money I raise over the $7,500 fundraising goal will be donated to the nonprofit organization or social impact project that donors choose.   Other Ways You Can Help I'm just like you. That is, organizations and people ask me for money almost every week. If I had a bottomless wallet, I'd give money to every one of them.
So I understand if this is not the right giving opportunity for you right now. 
If you believe in what I'm doing and you want to contribute in other ways, would you please consider one of these options?   Book me to share my experience and training in social impact with an audience that you choose.
Contribute money another way: Ask your company, house of worship, nonprofit organization, or school to hire me to assess and develop its community engagement program. I offer one-on-one sessions as short at 20 minutes.

The heritage week has become an </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">annual icon in Palestine’s summer cultural

areas in rural Palestine, which upon rehabilitation, can be employed for a sundry

new-fangled functions for the old houses, attics and architectural spaces. The
heritage week promotes a unique diverse experience tailored to valorize the
Palestinian national cultural identity and to disseminate concepts and ideas of
development among rural communities</span><br/></p>
<p>Every year the heritage week involves hundreds of young <b>local men</b> and
<b>women</b> in the organization as well as in designing and implementation of its
different activities, hence, ensuring gender equal opportunities for
participation and subsequently accumulation of <b>leadership skills</b> indispensable
to generate capacities in the fields of <b>art, culture, economy</b> and <b>event
organization.</b></p>
<p>The heritage week remains a platform that seeks to develop opportunities
for exchange with world cultures, expanding, diversifying participation and
completing the cultural mosaic.<b><i> It creates </i></b>a first-hand encounter
with the local community breaking the isolation matrix of control of 47 years
of Israeli occupation. </p>
<p>Needless to say, the heritage week has been instrumental in promoting
local Palestinian music, theatre and art productions as it has given a priority
for limelight.</p>
<p>With kind financial support of contributors, Rozana Association will be
able to protect and promote the available and potential Palestinian cultural
heritage and intercultural gender-aware dialogue locally, regionally, and
internationally consolidating social cohesion within Palestine and cultural
exchange with the rest of the world</p>
<p>Rozana Association is in need of <b><i>80’000 USD</i></b> to conduct Birzeit 8th Heritage week. Funds will be used to establish the heritage week administrative team from young men and women mostly from Birzeit town and surrounding villages in cooperation with partner rural CBOs. The administrative committee will monitor and oversee the work of 10 specialized committees who will manage the daily needs of young volunteers (food and beverages), of exhibitions to be displayed, cultural/Folkloric and Artistic events to be conducted, infrastructure and minor rehabilitation works to install the booths, the theaters…etc., the media and promotional materials needed as well as the Souq exhibitions and cinema corner needs. All the expenses will be managed by the Book keeping/finance committee who ensures transparent financial processes and reporting.<br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The best way to understand a culture is to see its
art so you can understand it far better than a language you cannot speak. Imagine
how Birzeit Heritage Week will provide a first-hand encounter with<b><i> an
actual Palestinian traditional Wedding and Zaffa</i></b> that will roam through
the Souq full of cultural and handcrafts booths not only of Palestinian culture
but also of other nations who come to exhibit their own cultural heritage and
goods. </p>
<p>During Birzeit heritage week, every visitor will be
able to meet and mingle among Palestinian families and international expat
communities who are distributed along several cultural corners watching live
how pottery or glass is being made, how carpets are being knit, or to watch a
Palestinian dabkeh or music show, or a cultural film at the cinema corner.</p>
<p>Birzeit heritage week is a place for every member of
the family, no matter what is his/her age, to find something to enjoy in the
midst of a Town that become glowing with cultural activities.</p>
<p>Crafts people at some corners, food making at other
corners, children cultural activities at another and cultural booths and arts
exhibitions extending along the different allies and spaces of the historic
area of Birzeit town.</p>

Attending the <b><i>Countryside Flower competition</i></b> is another
icon of the Heritage Week, where every Palestinian village sends its young
women representatives, dressed in their village traditional dress, to compete
on best knowledge of Palestinian culture including traditional music, dance,
crafts…etc.</div><div>
<p>
</p>
<p><b><i>Five summers nights in the beautiful outskirt of
rural West Bank (north of Ramallah and Bireh cities) will give a memorable
tourist interaction for each of the 40’000 visitors that reach Birzeit heritage
week annually.</i></b></p>
<p>In case Birzeit Heritage 8th Week does not receive the complete funds needed to conduct it, available funds will be used to build capacities of rural women and youth in 2 rural villages in the West Bank including tourist hospitality skills of 25 women with at least 15 homestays both theoretically and practically, train 25 youth as community guides armed with Community Based Tourism principles and interpretation methods to build community touristic programs and extend network for alternative tourism between the two municipalities/local village councils along Masar Ibrahim and Sufi Trails as explored by Rozana Association<br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Birzeit Heritage Week devises its uniqueness from a variety of elements.
First it employs the rehabilitated old houses and attics in the historic area
of Birzeit as a platform for the cultural and cultural heritage activities
adding a special ambience that is intertwined with the flagged stones of the
Mamluk and Ottoman era houses and attics. This exposes the efforts of
protecting the architectural heritage. Secondly, it offers an unmatched
diversity of <b>cultural life</b> compacted in one event. Thirdly, it connects
and encourages cultural exchange with the international community through the
international “Hosh” providing the space for keen countries to commission
exchange with the Palestinian local community. Fourth, it promotes the<b>
Palestinian cultural identity, creating awareness both locally and
internationally.</b> The peak ventures are the role and involvement of the
local communities that are considered a key factor in the development process as
well as the international exhibitions to strengthen partnerships within the
region and worldwide.</p>
<p>The participation of youth, women and the community at large
will
increase public awareness about the cultural, environmental, historical
process, and the potential values and benefits it may produce to galvanize and
encourage local production through enhancing traditional customs, food, native
dances and ancient handicrafts. The overarching aim is to engage the local
communities in a dynamic process, drawing their attention to planning and
protection requirements to safeguard the outstanding universal values of <b><i>indigenous
cultural heritage</i></b>.</p>
<p>During the past 7 Birzeit Heritage Weeks, <b><i>more than 200’000 people</i></b>
visited the different activities of the heritage weeks giving high exposure and
pride to Birzeit community and surrounding villages. Local Palestinian rural
population gained revenue at both local and national levels where the sale of
their cultural products, traditional food entangled with traditional fashion
revealed various integral aspects of Palestinian social identity and instilled
life in the alleys and streets of Palestinian marginalized rural areas.

<p>At Birzeit 8th heritage Week, Rozana Association and its local partner
CBOs and authorities promise you an unforgettable cultural experience for 5
nights under the summer sky of Palestine where we all take pride in our
heritage culture and its exchange for a better word that respects our

Birzeit Heritage week is part of a process to reconcile with a broken
history; every society heritage constitutes a fundamental factor in plumbing
historical and cultural depths whilst it expresses identity and interacts with
the social, political and environmental reality.<br/><p>
The major challenge for Birzeit Heritage Week
remains the availability of the funds that are necessary to build and then
promote the different cultural corners and booths. However, Rozana Association
had gained high trust among the national private sector as well among
international donor agencies that will hopefully contribute to covering some
financial needs.<br/></p>
<p>
Rozana Association with its high trust in the
local community due to its community-based approaches, several rural
communities are to contribute to safeguard the needed activities and
participations. People of the world who believe in culture as a tool for
positive change in each developed region, impacting positively the lives of
marginalized rural communities, mainly women and youth, will extend us a
helping hand to achieve our goals in this endeavor. <br/></p>
<br/>
</div><div><h3><br/></h3></div></div>","Rozana Association for the Development of
Architectural heritage is a Palestinian registered not for profit organization,
based in Birzeit's old Town that aims to network, consolidate, develop and promote
all available cultural, architectural and heritage resources in rural areas of
the West Bank to instill a process of development based on advancing rural
areas competitive advantage as a potential domestic and international tourist
destinations with positive negative impact.   

Our campaign intends to raise funds to conduct Birzeit 8th
Heritage week that aims to advance Palestinian cultural heritage and identity.
The heritage week has become an annual icon in Palestine’s summer cultural
activities as it provides a sustainable model about the importance of historic
areas in rural Palestine, which upon rehabilitation, can be employed for a sundry
of cultural, income generation and job creation activities that foster
new-fangled functions for the old houses, attics and architectural spaces. The
heritage week promotes a unique diverse experience tailored to valorize the
Palestinian national cultural identity and to disseminate concepts and ideas of
development among rural communities
Every year the heritage week involves hundreds of young local men and
women in the organization as well as in designing and implementation of its
different activities, hence, ensuring gender equal opportunities for
participation and subsequently accumulation of leadership skills indispensable
to generate capacities in the fields of art, culture, economy and event
organization.
The heritage week remains a platform that seeks to develop opportunities
for exchange with world cultures, expanding, diversifying participation and
completing the cultural mosaic. It creates a first-hand encounter
with the local community breaking the isolation matrix of control of 47 years
of Israeli occupation. 
Needless to say, the heritage week has been instrumental in promoting
local Palestinian music, theatre and art productions as it has given a priority
for limelight.
With kind financial support of contributors, Rozana Association will be
able to protect and promote the available and potential Palestinian cultural
heritage and intercultural gender-aware dialogue locally, regionally, and
internationally consolidating social cohesion within Palestine and cultural
exchange with the rest of the world
Rozana Association is in need of 80’000 USD to conduct Birzeit 8th Heritage week. Funds will be used to establish the heritage week administrative team from young men and women mostly from Birzeit town and surrounding villages in cooperation with partner rural CBOs. The administrative committee will monitor and oversee the work of 10 specialized committees who will manage the daily needs of young volunteers (food and beverages), of exhibitions to be displayed, cultural/Folkloric and Artistic events to be conducted, infrastructure and minor rehabilitation works to install the booths, the theaters…etc., the media and promotional materials needed as well as the Souq exhibitions and cinema corner needs. All the expenses will be managed by the Book keeping/finance committee who ensures transparent financial processes and reporting.


The best way to understand a culture is to see its
art so you can understand it far better than a language you cannot speak. Imagine
how Birzeit Heritage Week will provide a first-hand encounter with an
actual Palestinian traditional Wedding and Zaffa that will roam through
the Souq full of cultural and handcrafts booths not only of Palestinian culture
but also of other nations who come to exhibit their own cultural heritage and
goods. 
During Birzeit heritage week, every visitor will be
able to meet and mingle among Palestinian families and international expat
communities who are distributed along several cultural corners watching live
how pottery or glass is being made, how carpets are being knit, or to watch a
Palestinian dabkeh or music show, or a cultural film at the cinema corner.
Birzeit heritage week is a place for every member of
the family, no matter what is his/her age, to find something to enjoy in the
midst of a Town that become glowing with cultural activities.
Crafts people at some corners, food making at other
corners, children cultural activities at another and cultural booths and arts
exhibitions extending along the different allies and spaces of the historic
area of Birzeit town.

Attending the Countryside Flower competition is another
icon of the Heritage Week, where every Palestinian village sends its young
women representatives, dressed in their village traditional dress, to compete
on best knowledge of Palestinian culture including traditional music, dance,
crafts…etc.


Five summers nights in the beautiful outskirt of
rural West Bank (north of Ramallah and Bireh cities) will give a memorable
tourist interaction for each of the 40’000 visitors that reach Birzeit heritage
week annually.
In case Birzeit Heritage 8th Week does not receive the complete funds needed to conduct it, available funds will be used to build capacities of rural women and youth in 2 rural villages in the West Bank including tourist hospitality skills of 25 women with at least 15 homestays both theoretically and practically, train 25 youth as community guides armed with Community Based Tourism principles and interpretation methods to build community touristic programs and extend network for alternative tourism between the two municipalities/local village councils along Masar Ibrahim and Sufi Trails as explored by Rozana Association


Birzeit Heritage Week devises its uniqueness from a variety of elements.
First it employs the rehabilitated old houses and attics in the historic area
of Birzeit as a platform for the cultural and cultural heritage activities
adding a special ambience that is intertwined with the flagged stones of the
Mamluk and Ottoman era houses and attics. This exposes the efforts of
protecting the architectural heritage. Secondly, it offers an unmatched
diversity of cultural life compacted in one event. Thirdly, it connects
and encourages cultural exchange with the international community through the
international “Hosh” providing the space for keen countries to commission
exchange with the Palestinian local community. Fourth, it promotes the
Palestinian cultural identity, creating awareness both locally and
internationally. The peak ventures are the role and involvement of the
local communities that are considered a key factor in the development process as
well as the international exhibitions to strengthen partnerships within the
region and worldwide.
The participation of youth, women and the community at large
will
increase public awareness about the cultural, environmental, historical
process, and the potential values and benefits it may produce to galvanize and
encourage local production through enhancing traditional customs, food, native
dances and ancient handicrafts. The overarching aim is to engage the local
communities in a dynamic process, drawing their attention to planning and
protection requirements to safeguard the outstanding universal values of indigenous
cultural heritage.
During the past 7 Birzeit Heritage Weeks, more than 200’000 people
visited the different activities of the heritage weeks giving high exposure and
pride to Birzeit community and surrounding villages. Local Palestinian rural
population gained revenue at both local and national levels where the sale of
their cultural products, traditional food entangled with traditional fashion
revealed various integral aspects of Palestinian social identity and instilled
life in the alleys and streets of Palestinian marginalized rural areas.
Moreover, local rural producers exhibited their production and gained
financially as well as management wise from these experiences. The
foremost gains were the familiarization of young volunteers with the
terminology and procedures of heritage week including the preparation, planning
and execution of the events. Women organizations got the required exposure to
network locally and regionally to market their products not forgetting the exposure
of local and traditional artifacts and products that were enhanced. Palestinian
folkloric, music, dance and theater productions were promoted including
catering for Children artistic and recreational needs. Exchange with
regional and international cultures were highly fostered.

</div></div>","Hi! My name is Olivia Friedman.
I am a teacher at the Ida Crown Jewish Academy. Since we are a community, I think it would be great for us to acknowledge life-changing events in our community members' lives by providing them with a little something. (This means: faculty, administration, office staff, maintenance crew, cafeteria staff...if you work here, you're part of our crew!) Cynthia Levin used to do this and I would like to take over her role in creating and running The Sunshine Fund here at our school.
   What We Need  We need each member of the ICJA community (faculty/ staff and so forth) to donate so that we can collect funds to purchase items/ gift certificates/ a Yom Limmud to acknowledge: 
The birth of a staff member's child
The bar or bat mitzvah of a staff member's child
The passing of a staff member's immediate family member
An engagement or wedding in the immediate family

Get well soon in the event of an operation or other life event  
We suggest that you donate $10 to this goal. (Obviously, you can donate more or less! Any amount helps and shows your fellow ICJA members that you are thinking of them.) Any money which is not used this year will be saved up and added to The Sunshine Fund to be used in future years. 
   What You Get/ The Impact It's important for the Ida Crown community to care about one another. This is a great way to ensure that you and your life event are acknowledged, to celebrate each person's joy and to share in each other's sorrow. One year you will be on the receiving end of the Sunshine Fund and another year you will be the giver...the wheel keeps on turning! :)

Dungeon Mason is a small game development team in South Korea. Our team consists of mobile/social game veterans from Gameloft, Crytek, Unity, etc.
We want to create a social gambling game which is way more casual than poker, and has some unit collecting factor while not ruining the balance of gambling game play which is determined by luck.

Please help this project and donate £12 (or more)(approx 18.50 USD) and then you'll receivemy 2000 High Quality photos with my Eternal Gratitude :)
If you can't afford to donate then please share  this page on social media. It costs nothing, but might I will find a helping hand through your Facebook or Twitter post :) Thank you so much for your help :)
The goal of this project is that I'd like to bring that small and warm-hearted country into your room. My name is Peter Provics and I'm a Hungarian backpacker from Manchester (UK). In this June I'd like to go to Georgia and show you as many amazing places as it possible and take 2000 High Quality photos in those two weeks. Basically, I'd like to introduce Georgian people and their life, their towns and villages, and most importantly their beautiful country.What's in it for you?
...well, I hope 2000 High Quality photos for only £12 (18.50 USD)is not too bad... :)
Okay,
 now seriously. Please, have a look at the perks, There are many surprises for you. Not only the photos, there are photo albums, LIMITED EDITION albums, you would recieve handwritten postcards from Georgia and you can follow this 
journey online. Most importantly,
 you can get the access to download 2000 High Quality photos about Georgia (or you can receive them on DVDs too), 
including all the names of the places I'll visit and you can read 
about towns, villages, historical buildings, mountains, local 
programmes, food and also you can get tips for your potential journey, 
including museums, guesthouses, hotels and restaurants.I'll ship worldwide.
All of the pictures will be free for use for everyone who helps this tour and 
you'll be able to use them on any public platform as well, because this 
project is not about me, is about Georgia :)
I will need local help to reach my goal and I'm lucky that I've found an experienced Georgian guide called Maiko Papunashvili. She knows everything that we need for this project and with her help we can discover the most important places in Georgia, like Tbilisi, Kutaisi, Vardzia, Gori, Akhalcixe, Mtskheta, Batumi and also the Black Sea and the Caucasus. I know that I won't revolutionize the tourism there, so it might be just a little step for Georgians, but every little step counts and maybe in the future a few more tourists might just like to spend a holiday there.The route.

<p><i>Dance Soul Motion, owner Dominique Mastrototoro and her staff are ready to go BIG: are you ready to help?</i></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi! My name is Dominique Mastrototoro.  I have been teaching movement based fitness for 15 years, starting with a love of dance at age 3.  By the time I was 16, I was teaching, dancing, and looking for ways to incorporate the joy of movement into everyday life: I started dreaming about owning a studio of my own.  </p>
<p>I continued to study dance, as well as public relations, at Boston University.  During this time I discovered yoga and began to deepen my appreciation for the connection between the soul and the body in motion. In 2010, I became a 200-hr Registered Yoga Teacher through Yoga Works. Following my training I continued to work in fitness, managing various yoga studios and gyms in Boston, and expanding my skills by earning certifications and licenses in Pilates, Barre, Zumba and TRX.  </p>
<p>With the knowledge of my teachings, both academic and fitness based, and the support of my family and friends I was ready to make my dream a reality and open a fitness studio; I continue to love what I do and look forward to the opportunity to grow my dream.</p>

Bulgaria - a small country in the Balkans with ancient culture and great
traditions. I have started my career more than 6 years ago when I found my love
for bread. My thirst for learning, exploration and development of  my skills and knowledge of bread making, have
led me to meet great master bakers in France, Austria, South Korea and Sweden
as well as some short visits in few other countries.</span><br/></i></p>
<p><i>In 2013 I have opened a
fermentation and artisan bread making school which shortly gain popularity and
became the only such school in Bulgaria.</i></p>
<p><i>In 2014 we opened a small microbakery to establish our name and experiment with recipes and innovation. We continued the school and teach the people our ways.</i></p>
<p><i>Our aim is to open a
bakery where we can do each and every part of the bread making process-from
grounding the flour in stone mills to baking the hand-made bread in a

<p><i>Здравейте, казвам се
Пресиян от „Братя Хлебари” и съм хлебар и мелничар от малката държава България
на Балканския полуoстров в южна Европа. Макар и малко, ние сме горди и смели
хора, които независимо от трудностите се борят докрай за това, в което вярват.
Така започна и моята кариера като хлебар преди повече от 5 години - с молби да
чиракувам и с тежък труд при различни хлебари. Времето ми показа моя път.
Последваха стажове в чужбина – Франция, Австрия, Южна Корея, Швеция и кратки
визити в други държави. </i><i>Срещите
с хлебари на различни места по света ме обогатяват като хлебар и ми помагат да
разбера колко важно е възраждането на занаятите. </i></p>
<p><i>Сега дойде времето в
България и на Балканите да се надигне една нова вълна, едно ново време, една
промяна от </i><i>красив
характер<span>. Наричаме я кулинарна балканска революция,
но и еволюция. Аз като хлебар се интересувам от мястото на хлебарството в нея. Защо
революция и еволюция - защото дава импулс за нещо ново и донякъде забравено старо, но в
същото време иновативно и  ориентирано към бъдещето. </span></i></p>
<p><i>През изминалата 2014
година създадохме скромна експериментална Хлебарница с  малкото пари, които имахме. </i><i>Продължихме да развиваме стартиралото през
2013 Училище по Хлебарство и Ферментации с идеята да учим хората на
занаятчийските подходи в хлебарството. </i></p>
<p><i>Следващият логичен етап
от нашето развитие е да направим голяма хлебарница, където спокойно да
обучаваме ученици да се потапят в света на живите ферментации и древни похвати,
за да отварят нови хлебарници и в други  градове
и села. Това вярваме, е начина да се възродят Балканите и да станат едно много
по-добро място за живеене. </i><i>За
да осъществим тази наша мечта и да продължим да творим и да вървим напред,
водейки вълната на промяна, имаме нужда от помощта Ви – на Вас, всички наши приятели,
фенове и хора, съпричастни към Делото ни. </i></p>
<p><i>Обръщаме се към Вас с
призива да станете част от нашата Мисия и ЗАЕДНО да станем свидетели на
красивите плодове на нашия отдаден труд.</i></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get / </h3>

София. Вече намерихме мястото, в което се влюбихме. Кандидатствахме за банков
заем и спестяваме всички пари, които изкарваме с работата си към момента. Тъй

<h3>The Impact / Въздействието</h3> <p></p>
<p><i>Our mission to revive all the artisan crafts tied to bread baking - milling, pottery, wood carving and so on will contribute to a whole change in the economic situation in our homeland and the Balkans as a whole.</i></p>
<p><i>It will contribute to a change in the way people think and bring back long forgotten and lost life and moral values from before the industrialization.<br/></i></p>
<p><i>Also it will contribute for revival of the farming as local and smallscale. We work strongly with small farms and if we can only local and all our students who we teach our methods will do the same. This we believe will revive all the regions of Bulgaria and the Balkans.</i></p>
<p><i>Educating our customers and the people of every detail around real Bread, flour and all other products of our Craft will clear the market of all those that misuse the trust customers give us and put high prices on low quality products. From this the people will win the most.</i></p>
<p><i>The continuation of ""The school of Bread Baking and Fermentation"" into a new chapter will helps us extend our teachings for the children and educate a new generation of creators and idealists, that will dream and work for a better and more beautiful world.</i></p>
<p><i>Мисията
ни да възраждаме занаятите обвързани с хлебарството – мелничарство,
грънчарство, дърводелство и прочие ще допринесе за една цялостна промяна на
икономическото състояние на Родината ни и Балканите като цяло. </i></p>
<p><i>Ще
допринесе още за една промяна в начина на мислене на хората и връщане на част
от забравените и изгубени житейски и морални ценности от преди необмислената
индустриализация.</i></p>
<p><i>Също
така ще доведем до съживяване на фермерството като локално и дребно такова.
Работим силно с малки ферми по възможност само локално и всеки един наш ученик
работещ по нашите методи и обучен от нас ще направи същото. Това вярваме
постепенно ще съживи регионите в България, а от там и Балканите.</i></p>
<p><i>Обучаването
на клиентите и информирането на хората за всеки един детайл от истинския Хляб,
брашно и всякакви други продукти на труда ни, постепенно ще изчисти пазара
от всички, които злоупотребяват с доверието на купувача и продават каквото и да
било на високи цени. От това най-много ще спечелят обикновените хора.</i></p>
<p><i>Продължавате
на „Училището по Хлебарство и Ферментации” на един нов етап ще ни помогне да
разгърнем дейността си и към децата и да възпитаме едно ново поколение творци и
идеалисти, които да работят за един по-красив и съвършен свят.</i></p>

<p>Risks when we open:</p>
<p>1.To not fill our production capacity soon enough and to have a lack of clients in the first three months.</p>
<p>Solution - That`s why we put the rent and expenses for the first three months into the investment so we should worry about it.</p>
<p>2.To have difficulty finding the right people for our team fast enough.</p>
<p>Solution - for more than 2 yeras we teach students in ""The School for Bread Baking and Fermentation"" and this makes it much easier to choose and hire people for our team.</p>
<p>3.The risk that our product might not be seen on the market from the rivalry products.</p>
<p>Solution - For more than one year we are on the market and we build our name as unique artisans with a lot of perspective and new approach. People recognize us and we have a lot of customers, that we just have to increase. </p>
<p>Рисковете
при отварянето са:</p>
<p>1.<span> 
</span>Да
не изпълним достатъчно бързо капацитета за производство и да има недостиг от
клиенти в първите 3 месеца</p>
<p>Решение – затова сме сложили наемите за
първите 3 месеца в инвестицията за да не се налага да се тревожим за това още в
самото начало.</p>
<p>2.<span> 
</span>Да
не успеем достатъчно бързо да намерим добри помощници за Хлебарницата като
персонал.</p>
<p>Решение – от почти 2 години обучаваме ученици
в „Училището по Хлебарство” и така подготвихме предварително някой наши кадри,
което улеснява много подбора ни на помощници.</p>
<p>3.<span> 
</span>Риск
продукта ни да не бъде отличен на пазара заради подобни конкурентни продукти.</p>
<p>Решение – вече една година се налагаме на пазара
като уникални занаятчии с много перспективи и нови подходи. Хората ни
разпознават и имаме изграден клиентски поток, който просто трябва да
увеличаваме.</p>

My name is Presiyan, I
am founder and co-owner of a small baking company “Baker Brothers”. I come from
Bulgaria - a small country in the Balkans with ancient culture and great
traditions. I have started my career more than 6 years ago when I found my love
for bread. My thirst for learning, exploration and development of  my skills and knowledge of bread making, have
led me to meet great master bakers in France, Austria, South Korea and Sweden
as well as some short visits in few other countries.
In 2013 I have opened a
fermentation and artisan bread making school which shortly gain popularity and
became the only such school in Bulgaria.
In 2014 we opened a small microbakery to establish our name and experiment with recipes and innovation. We continued the school and teach the people our ways.
Our aim is to open a
bakery where we can do each and every part of the bread making process-from
grounding the flour in stone mills to baking the hand-made bread in a
professional deck oven.
We are aware this is a
huge investment and we are working hard to collect all we need for it.
We will be thankful if
you choose to support us during this process.

От какво имаме нужда &  Какво получавате 
We need a big space, professional
equipment, commercial part and a stone mill. All this in one bakery in Sofia. We already found a location we fell inlove with. We applied for a bank loan and save all the money we earn with our current work. Since we need quite a big investment we started this indiegogo project, to reach for our fans or people interested in what we do.
We will buy a big austrian stone mill, to freshly mill at least 50% of our daily flour. 
One or two french deck ovens from Bongard company. One spiral mixer, one diving arm mixer and several refrigerators. Several wooden tables for dividing, resting and shaping the dough.A wooden style commercial part for customers and visitors to enjoy sandwiches, coffee, enzyme tea, fermented sodas, honey wine and much more. There has to be 4 toilets - 2 for customers and 2 for our team.
Small garden infront of the bakery to bring harmony to everyone and everything.
A good ventilation system and so on.
Everything more that we recieve, gain or so on will be used for the baking school to upgrade with wood, ovens, personal equipment for each future student and uniforms. All spent money will be shown as pictures or videos, and all we do will be documented. 
Имаме нужда от голямо пространство, професионално
оборудване, търговска част и каменна мелница. Всичко това в една хлебарница в
София. Вече намерихме мястото, в което се влюбихме. Кандидатствахме за банков

като имаме нужда от много голяма инвестиция стартирахме този indiegogoпроект,
да достигнем до всички наши фенове и хора заинтригувани от това, което правим.
Ще закупим голяма австрийска каменна мелница, за да мелим
прясно поне 50% от дневното ни брашно.
Една или две френски подови пещи на фирма Бонгард. Един
спирален миксер, един миксер с падаща ръка и няколко хладилника. Няколко
дървени плотове и маси за сечене, преоформяне, почивка и оформяне на тестото.
Дървен шкаф за последна ферментация.
Търговска част в дървен стил за да могат нашите клиенти и
гости да се наслаждават на сандвичи, кафе, ензимен чай, ферментирали сокове,
медовина и още много...
Трябва да има четири тоалетни – две за гости и две за екипа.
Малка градинка пред Хлебарницата за да донесе хармония на всеки
и всичко.
Добра вентилационна система.
Всичко отгоре, което съберем, получим и прочие, ще бъде
използвано за училището по Хлебарство да се преоборудва с пещи, дървени плотове
и мебели, униформи и персонално оборудване за всеки бъдещ ученик.
Всички похарчени пари ще бъдат показани със снимки или
видео, и всичко ще бъде подробно документирано.

The Impact / Въздействието 
Our mission to revive all the artisan crafts tied to bread baking - milling, pottery, wood carving and so on will contribute to a whole change in the economic situation in our homeland and the Balkans as a whole.
It will contribute to a change in the way people think and bring back long forgotten and lost life and moral values from before the industrialization.
Also it will contribute for revival of the farming as local and smallscale. We work strongly with small farms and if we can only local and all our students who we teach our methods will do the same. This we believe will revive all the regions of Bulgaria and the Balkans.
Educating our customers and the people of every detail around real Bread, flour and all other products of our Craft will clear the market of all those that misuse the trust customers give us and put high prices on low quality products. From this the people will win the most.
The continuation of ""The school of Bread Baking and Fermentation"" into a new chapter will helps us extend our teachings for the children and educate a new generation of creators and idealists, that will dream and work for a better and more beautiful world.
Мисията
ни да възраждаме занаятите обвързани с хлебарството – мелничарство,
грънчарство, дърводелство и прочие ще допринесе за една цялостна промяна на
икономическото състояние на Родината ни и Балканите като цяло. 
Ще
допринесе още за една промяна в начина на мислене на хората и връщане на част
от забравените и изгубени житейски и морални ценности от преди необмислената
индустриализация.
Също
така ще доведем до съживяване на фермерството като локално и дребно такова.
Работим силно с малки ферми по възможност само локално и всеки един наш ученик
работещ по нашите методи и обучен от нас ще направи същото. Това вярваме
постепенно ще съживи регионите в България, а от там и Балканите.
Обучаването
на клиентите и информирането на хората за всеки един детайл от истинския Хляб,
брашно и всякакви други продукти на труда ни, постепенно ще изчисти пазара
от всички, които злоупотребяват с доверието на купувача и продават каквото и да
било на високи цени. От това най-много ще спечелят обикновените хора.
Продължавате
на „Училището по Хлебарство и Ферментации” на един нов етап ще ни помогне да
разгърнем дейността си и към децата и да възпитаме едно ново поколение творци и
идеалисти, които да работят за един по-красив и съвършен свят.

    Risks & Challenges / Рискове & Препятствия
 
Risks when we open:
1.To not fill our production capacity soon enough and to have a lack of clients in the first three months.
Solution - That`s why we put the rent and expenses for the first three months into the investment so we should worry about it.
2.To have difficulty finding the right people for our team fast enough.
Solution - for more than 2 yeras we teach students in ""The School for Bread Baking and Fermentation"" and this makes it much easier to choose and hire people for our team.
3.The risk that our product might not be seen on the market from the rivalry products.
Solution - For more than one year we are on the market and we build our name as unique artisans with a lot of perspective and new approach. People recognize us and we have a lot of customers, that we just have to increase. 
Рисковете
при отварянето са:
1. 
Да
не изпълним достатъчно бързо капацитета за производство и да има недостиг от
клиенти в първите 3 месеца
Решение – затова сме сложили наемите за
първите 3 месеца в инвестицията за да не се налага да се тревожим за това още в
самото начало.
2. 
Да
не успеем достатъчно бързо да намерим добри помощници за Хлебарницата като
персонал.
Решение – от почти 2 години обучаваме ученици
в „Училището по Хлебарство” и така подготвихме предварително някой наши кадри,
което улеснява много подбора ни на помощници.
3. 
Риск
продукта ни да не бъде отличен на пазара заради подобни конкурентни продукти.
Решение – вече една година се налагаме на пазара
като уникални занаятчии с много перспективи и нови подходи. Хората ни
разпознават и имаме изграден клиентски поток, който просто трябва да
увеличаваме.

Other Ways You Can Help /

сме част...

I am so humbled and grateful that you've taken the consideration of helping me achieve my dream. I am very excited to be working in my community as Miss Dayton Ohio United States 2015, but I have my eye on the state title for several reasons including: I would like to bring more awareness to my platform (suicide prevention), I would be able to accomplish more professional and personal goals, and this would open the door for me to pursue many new opportunities. </p><p></p><p>I still need a few things before I will be ready for the pageant and funds will go towards my evening gown, the specified clothes for each portion of the pageant, the hotel expenses, travel costs, food for the weekend, all pageant fees, and all expenses related to competing for Miss Ohio United States 2015.</p><p>In 2015, I will be working through my platform (which is a non-profit that I am currently founding) that aims to bring character building among students. My vision is to partner with Miss Ohio United States 2015 to speak in schools about bullying and character development with the underlying goal of suicide prevention. I know I am most certainly tired of turning on the news to find out that, unfortunately, another young person has taken their life.

I am so humbled and grateful that you've taken the consideration of helping me achieve my dream. I am very excited to be working in my community as Miss Dayton Ohio United States 2015, but I have my eye on the state title for several reasons including: I would like to bring more awareness to my platform (suicide prevention), I would be able to accomplish more professional and personal goals, and this would open the door for me to pursue many new opportunities. I still need a few things before I will be ready for the pageant and funds will go towards my evening gown, the specified clothes for each portion of the pageant, the hotel expenses, travel costs, food for the weekend, all pageant fees, and all expenses related to competing for Miss Ohio United States 2015.In 2015, I will be working through my platform (which is a non-profit that I am currently founding) that aims to bring character building among students. My vision is to partner with Miss Ohio United States 2015 to speak in schools about bullying and character development with the underlying goal of suicide prevention. I know I am most certainly tired of turning on the news to find out that, unfortunately, another young person has taken their life. Please join me in getting the word out to students across Ohio that there is hope and let's help our students and communities build character to achieve a life-lasting impact. Besides my platform, I also am looking to make more achievements in 2015. Through this pageant, I will have many opportunities in politics, fashion, and leadership.

</div>Help us to provide life saving support in rural Romania!<br/><br/>We are a Romanian non-profit organization that provides search and rescue<br/>
services in the rural areas of Romania/Moldova. The organization consists<br/>
of skilled volunteers and experienced professionals, which put their free<br/>
time and money in serving the ones in need.<br/>
<br/>
SARS Romania provided their services in case of natural- and other<br/>
disasters like the heavy floods in Moldova (2010), forest fires, mountain<br/>
rescue, collapsed buildings etc. Unfortunately the financial situation in<br/>
Romania doesn't allow for large investments to support life saving<br/>
projects, as government funding is virtually non-existent. Therefore we<br/>
bring in our own capital to provide as much help when we can, where we<br/>
can.<br/>
<br/>
So why do we need help?<br/>
<br/>
We are supported by a lot of experienced personnel from all kinds of fields<br/>
(doctors, search dog trainers, military personnel, mountaineers, etc)<br/>
though we can't afford the purchase of a vehicle that is capable of<br/>
handling the rural roads of the Romanian Carpathians, Retezat and other hard<br/>
to reach locations. We are in desperate need of a vehicle which can get a<br/>
search team into a hit area as soon as possible, as in cases of mud slides<br/>
and avalanches - all seconds count! In the 6 years that we are active we<br/>
already invested all of our personal capital in the purchase of life<br/>
saving first aid equipment, stretchers, climbing and diving<br/>
equipment. As much as it hurts our pride, we are forced to call upon the<br/>
public to make sure we can continue what we are doing.<br/>
<br/>
How are we going to do it?<br/>
<br/>
The plan is to raise €10.000,- to purchase and maintain a 2nd hand pick-up<br/>
truck. We won't invest in a new vehicle as the depreciation of a new<br/>
pick-up would be a giant waste of resources. Instead we choose to invest<br/>
it in maintaining, fueling and repairing a rugged (and proven) Toyota<br/>
Hilux. The parts are easily to come by, which can be tricky with newer<br/>
models and it provides sufficient space to transport supplies and possible<br/>
casualties. The pick-up will be fitted with first aid equipment (including<br/>
a stretcher, neck braces etc), urban search and rescue (USAR) gear, diving<br/>
equipment and climbing gear. All it would take for us to reach that goal is for 100 people donate €100 each.<br/>
<br/>
If we can't raise enough funds to purchase a reliable vehicle, the money<br/>
will be invested in medical supplies and additional search and rescue<br/>
gear. Please lend us a helping hand by sharing this on social media,<br/>
forums, hospital boards and military bases.<br/>
<br/>
We appreciate every penny and will make sure it comes to good use. With<br/>
your help we'll be able to fill the needs in the rural areas, where people<br/>
are still dying every week because help is simply too late. If you are not<br/>
able to spare some money, please feel free to support us by sharing this<br/>
on social media or by providing medical supplies (bandaging material,<br/>
first aid kits, foldable splints, used stretchers etc), rescue gear or<br/>
other things that can support our group.<br/><br/>Vă mulțumim pentru ajutor!<br/></div>","Help us to provide life saving support in rural Romania!We are a Romanian non-profit organization that provides search and rescue

I am employed as a motivational speaker for the Re-Member Organization --a volunteer organization working to improve the living conditions and lives of the Lakota People. I can be found in the staff directory at this url.  http://www.re-member.org/ I'm a dedicated Father, Grandfather, Husband and Co-founder of the Green Party. I've also been active in the peace, social and environmental movements for many decades and have travelled extensively promoting social and world change speaking at many schools and Universities across the country. I also served for a number of years as Chairman of the Head Start Policy Council here in SD. Currently I am the President of the Our Lady of Sorrows Church Council.The cover photo is of Santana Janis, a 12 yrs old girl that committed suicide on Feb. 4th 2015. As the family was preparing for her services there were two other children being buried in other areas of the Reservation. The week this beautiful child ended her own life there were eight suicides across the Lakota tribal homeland. Extreme poverty and 80-90% unemployment renders communities where hopelessness and despair, broken family structures, crime and violence, domestic and child abuse and neglect are permeating.      The incorporation of the United States has had extremely negative consequences on the Lakota people. There's nothing worse than being removed from ones rich culture and traditions then being made to feel like you have absolutely no contribution to the very society that your lands and resources helped create. In our legally authorized Treaty lands, a territory that is defined in an agreement between the United States and the Lakota people (the 1868 Treaty of Ft. Laramie) we are still on the receiving end of racial hate and intolerance. This is affecting our children that often say ""what's the point of living?"" No one likes us! In this third millennium when life itself is imperiled our children feel like they are being denied a loving and positive future because of so much hatred. http://aje.io/bpss The horrible consequences and statistics are staggering. Each year just on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation alone, twenty to thirty children end their lives. Every year there are over five-hundred reported threats with as high as 350 attempts. In a ten-year period that's 2-300 suicides (mostly little girls), 5,000 reported threats, and 3,500 attempts that require hospitalization and intervention!  These statistics should be unacceptable.      Each year for the past six-years our family has taken in twenty to thirty young girls at risk and nurtured them with unconditional love at a summer math camp we host.

</p><p>Siberian pine nuts are completely organic and wild
harvested.  They contain no GMOs and come
from trees that have not been grafted. 
Pine nuts are 100% natural and pure, and may be called the King of Super
Foods.</p>
<p>Siberian pine nuts are the most
valuable product of all known products obtained from various plants.  On average, any product—whether nuts, fruits,
seeds, root vegetables, or berries—takes from three to five months to ripen,
and ripening does not occur during the winter. 
Pine nuts ripen over a period of two years, and are a much more valuable
product for human health.</p>
<p>Pine nuts may completely replace
any product, but there is no single product that can replace pine nuts.</p>
<p>Pine nuts have long been used in various cuisines of the
world; they are held in high regard for their unique taste and medicinal
properties.  With an amazing slightly
sweet taste containing hints of milk, pine nuts have been used both in main
dishes and desserts.  The nuts have
always been a delicacy and a much sought-after ingredient at the tables of
nobles and kings.  Modern science has
studied the chemical composition of pine nuts and explained their usefulness.</p>
<p>Pine nuts are the absolute
record-holders for containing the most vitamins.  For example, in one hundred grams of nuts
there are forty-eight recommended daily doses of high-quality vitamin B2; so,
to make up a deficiency of this vitamin, you only need to eat two grams of pine
nuts a day.  One hundred grams of pine
nuts also contain twenty-two recommended daily doses of natural vitamin B1, and
forty percent of the recommended daily dose of organic folic acid and vitamin PP.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448382660/tq0100euz5tseixn2dqy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>With regard to minerals, pine nuts
are no less amazing.  Two hundred grams
of pine nuts contain the recommended daily dose of magnesium.  These nuts are also rich in potassium,
phosphorus, and copper.</p>
<p>The protein content of pine nuts
is much richer than chicken, pork or ham. 
Pine nuts also contain all amino acids, including the essential amino
acids, as well as those that are important for children, such as arginine and
histidine.  The balanced protein of pine
nuts is so close to the protein compounds of human tissue that 99% of this
protein is capable of being assimilated by the body.</p>
<p>Siberian pine nuts are a concentrated source of vitamins E
and P.  Vitamin E is a powerful
antioxidant, capable of neutralizing the oxidizing processes in the body.  As a result of its action, the level of blood
cholesterol is lowered, and the body is rejuvenated.</p>
<p>Pine nuts contain much more vitamin E than other popular
products, such as olive oil, wheat germ oil, or coconut oil.  Group E vitamins, or tocopherols, are very
important and essential for ensuring full transmission of genetic
material.  Translated from the Greek,
tocopheral means “I bear offspring.”</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448491299/qyvhc97xmxi6rhcdwlya.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>The most important and significant factor in pine nuts is
their content of up to 70% of valuable fats of plant origin of all three types:
saturated, monosaturated, and polyunsaturated, including a high quantity of the
rarest, and therefore the most valuable fatty acid, Omega-3.  Omega-3 and Omega-6 are contained in pine
nuts in an ideal proportion, practically 1:1</p>
<p>Popular scientific literature also points out that the
quality of pine growing in Northern areas is much higher than those in the
South. Back in 1792 academician P. S. Pallas wrote that the Siberian pine nuts
rejuvenate man's power. They also bring back youthfulness, stimulate the immune
system considerably, increasing the physical body's resistance against many
diseases. World history knows a great number of historical phenomena directly
or indirectly connected with pine. Here is one of them. A half literate
countryman, Gregory Rasputin, from a remote Siberian village, was from the
region where Siberian pine grows. He came to Moscow in 1907 when he was already
50 years of age. He startled the royal family, where he was heartily welcomed,
because of his prophecies; He was sexually involved with many distinguished
ladies. Those who were trying to kill him were shocked by the fact that having
been hit by many bullets, he was still alive. His vitality was amazing. The
secret was that he had been brought up in the region where pine grows and he
had been fed on pine nuts. The journalists of that period summarized his
endurance: “At 50 years of age, he could start an orgy at noon, continuing his
drunken ordeals till 4 a. m. After erotic involvement and drinking heavily he
went right to church for morning services where he prayed till 8 a.m. After
returning home, he drank a lot of tea as if nothing had happened before,
Grishka received visitors till 2 p.m. Then accompanied by a group of ladies, he
went to a Russian bathhouse with a steamer and then went directly to a suburban
restaurant. There he repeated the previous night's performance. No ordinary man
could possibly stand up to that kind of routine”. Today, the several times
world and Olympic champion in wrestling Alexander Karelin, is also a Siberian,
again from the region where Siberian pine grows. The strong man has eaten pine
nuts all his life.</p>
<p><b>What we want to do.</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448134273/eo5mkaty9tpvyy958xfm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
A team of brave people <span>from Energy of Life Company, together with
residents of local eco settlement, are organizing an expedition to the
taiga, and will deliver, to your table, wholesome and fresh pine nuts within a
period of two weeks after the nuts have been shelled.</span>
<p>We collect pine cones that have
fallen to the ground by themselves, which ensures a harvest of only ripened
cones.</p>
<p>We take the entire cone out of the
forest.  Nuts in their cones can be kept
for up to three years without any loss of quality.</p>
<p>In the warehouse, we use commercial refrigerators, which
ensure the preservation of all the nutritional substances in the pine nut.</p>
<p>After the nuts have been shelled, they are immediately
vacuum-packed, which protects the pine nuts from the oxidizing effect of the
surrounding air.  In addition, the
packaging we use does not contain chlorine.</p>
<p>We do not wait until we have
processed all the nuts, but ship out pine nuts in small batches to warehouses
in America, Canada, and Germany.</p>
<p>Our warehouses are equipped with commercial freezers, which
ensure the maximum preservation of the pine nuts.</p>
<p>Pine nuts are shipped from Russia to America only by airline
over the course of two days and only in thermally insulated containers.</p>
<p>Mail delivery of orders is by expedited service.</p>
<p>No more than two weeks goes by
from the instant we shell the cones until the time you receive the wholesome
pine nuts!  And in these two weeks the
nuts are refrigerated.</p>
<p>After you receive your pine nuts, they must be kept in a
refrigerator.  For longer storage, the
nuts must be placed in a freezer, where they can be kept for up to twelve
months without any loss of quality.</p>
<p><b>Why we come up with
this idea</b><br/>
<br/>
We are big fans of pine nuts, for extensive period of time we try to find fresh
Siberian pine nuts in stores. We go through different health food stores in every
states which we visit by occasion, we search all internet sites including eBay
and Amazon, the best which we found was Italian pine nuts, all other was from
China (the main difference between Siberian, Chinese and Italian pine nuts you
can find below in FAQ).  All of
them were far away from Siberian nuts by the quality, taste and health effect.<br/>
<br/>
We start to think on an idea how to bring healthy Siberian pine nuts to USA.  Our team strongly believe that the residents
of greatest country of the world, should have the best products from all over
the world, including Siberian pine nuts. <br/>
We decide that healing Siberian pine nut will be our team contribution to the bright
future of our great country.  <br/>
<b><br/>
Our team try to cooperate with grocery and organic stores chains.</b></p>
<p>During the
last year our administrators contacted various grocery chain stores to offer
fresh pine nuts coming directly from Siberia for realization. However, we
received the same reply from the stores: “Chinese suppliers offer cheaper pine
nuts”. All our reasoning about low quality and non-fresh pine nuts which might
be even dangerous for consumption was dismissed on the ground of unmerciful
thesis: “The customers are interested in cheap price first of all, as cheaper
as better. The quality is not that important.”</p>
<p>We will never agree with such statement. We believe
that every person wants to consume only high quality products and obtain health
benefits from them. We’ve decided to address directly to the consumers and
offer high quality, fresh Siberian pine nuts. 

</p><p><span></span></p><p><b>Our
team developed a plan that can radically change the situation.</b></p><p></p>
<p>However, we need your financial support in order to
implement a unique and highly productive distribution system – direct marketing
of Siberian pine nuts in North America.</p>
<p>All initial financing will be applied to organizing
the expedition in Siberian taiga and processing machinery acquisition,
including:</p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>Off-road
vehicle with extra low pressure tires for carrying pine nuts out of taiga which
will not damage topsoil (unfortunately there are not roads inside taiga
forests)</p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>Shelling
machinery for pine cones and pine nuts</p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>Packing
machinery for packaging the pine nuts into vacuum bags</p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>Additional
commercial freezers</p>
<p>Also substantial financing is required for air
transportation of pine nuts to North America. </p>
<p></p><p><b>We've
already accomplished much:</b></p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>We rented
ecologically pure section of taiga for harvesting pine nuts.</p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>We received a
special license which allows to export pine nuts outside of Russia.</p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>We developed a
unique system of direct marketing which allows delivering pine nuts directly to
our customers within 2 weeks from the pine nut processing.  </p>
<p>We apply procedures that protect
the forest; our technologies for processing pine nuts are the best in the
world; the delivery system we have developed is one of the fastest and most
sophisticated; our direct-marketing technology excludes a chain of middle-men,
which makes it possible to offer you the best price.</p><p></p><p>We are making an agreement with American company SIBERIAN PINES - a leading distributor of pine products in North America - to be our guarantor and selling agent.</p><p>SIBERIAN PINES company has been operating in North America since 2003 and has refrigerated warehouses in Detroit, MI, USA; Toronto, ON, Canada; Dusseldorf, Germany.

<h2>Frequently asked questions (FAQ):</h2>
<p><b>Q: Who are they? Are they reliable?</b></p>
<p>We have dedicated a lot of time and effort to study and organise direct marketing system for Siberian pine nuts. We really want to make Siberian pine nuts your local food. We have a clear plan, are making good progress and will continue to do so.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We are making an agreement with American company SIBERIAN PINES - a leading distributor of pine products in North America - to be our guarantor and selling agent.</p>
<p>SIBERIAN PINES company has been operating in North America since 2003 and has refrigerated warehouses in Detroit, MI, USA; Toronto, ON, Canada; Dusseldorf, Germany. SIBERIAN PINES delivers all orders through major postal companies such as USPS, UPS and Canada Post using expedited service. All orders are insured.</p>

<p>All orders will be delivered or money back guarantee.</p>
<p>If you have any concerns or questions we would be happy to answer you in person.</p>
<p><b>Q: What will the funds raised be spent on?</b></p>
<p>We rent 8000 acres of Siberian taiga where we can gather the pine nuts, we have warehouse where we will process and pack pine nuts. However, our production capacities are not enough to maintain stable business. We need additional funds to acquire new and more powerful machinery for processing and carrying out pine nuts from the taiga.</p>
<p>We will spend the funds on making the very highest quality pine nuts and delivery to you.</p>
<p><b>Q: When I should expect my Siberian pine nuts?</b></p>
<p>First butch of packed pine nuts we expect to receive in our US warehouse between beginning of December 2015 and end of January 2016 depending on harvest availability and volume of orders. Orders will be sent on the first-buy-first-sent basis.</p>
<p><b>Q: What about Chinese pine nuts? I saw them in local food store.</b></p>
<p>Pine nuts must be fresh to benefit the body. But what is going on today? Before they reach a satisfied purchaser in the United States or Canada, pine nuts pass through many middlemen over the course of 16 to 19 months.</p>
<p>As soon as the nuts are extracted from the cone, they begin to lose their medicinal qualities. So, to make the harvesting of the nuts easier, the cones are shelled right in the forest, and only the nuts are brought out. The harvesting takes approximately three to four months. Then the nuts are taken to the base, where hundreds of tons of nuts are accumulated for export to China; this process takes another three to four months. Then the nuts are loaded onto rail cars and moved through Russia and China to the maritime regions of China; this procedure takes from one and a half to two months. To minimize expenses during the process of harvesting and transport, the nuts are stored under awnings in bags or in a pile, and so the nuts are subject to mold, the so-called ""blue mold."" Naturally, the nuts continue to lose their medicinal properties. One train can contain up to five hundred tons of pine nuts; each year more than twenty thousand tons of pine nuts are exported from Russia to China.</p>
<p>Then the processing of the pine nuts begins. It takes up to five months to process a large quantity of nuts. Afterwards, the nuts are loaded into ship containers and travel to North America, which usually takes two months. But this is not yet all: once in the warehouse, the nuts are distributed to stores and delivered in trucks, which takes another month. How much time passes before you see nuts on the shelves? No one knows, but let's add one more month for the rotation of stock in the stores. In this case, there is no point in even mentioning the storage temperature or even vacuum packaging—here this would be of no help whatsoever. The instant the shell was removed from the nut, the oxidation of the fats in the nuts begins; these processes accelerate at the high temperatures—up to plus 50 degree Celsius—found in the closed, unventilated containers on the deck of a ship exposed to direct sunlight.</p>
<p>So, 19 months goes by! From the day the nuts are found in the forest to the day you buy them in a store: A year and a half! Any type of freshness is out of the question.</p>
<p>And now, pay particular attention! If you thought that the nuts on store shelves being a year and a half old was the biggest problem, you couldn't be more wrong.</p>
<p>In order to increase their profit from the processing of pine nuts, Chinese producers initially extract the oil from the nuts using a chemical means that does not disturb/destroy the structure of the nut. This is done to derive the greatest profit, because pine nut oil is worth more than 80 dollars a kilogram on the market. So, they have already made money from the oil, and they are now making money from the nuts; here is the Chinese ""miracle.""</p>
<p><b>This is how it happens:</b></p>
<p>Obtaining the oil using extraction. The extraction method of removing oil is the most economical and ensures the maximum yield of the raw oil.</p>
<p>Sunflower seeds, pine nuts, cotton seeds, linen seeds, peanuts and others are processed in the same way.</p>
<p>The basis of the extraction process is the ability of vegetable oils to dissolve in organic solvents. In China and other countries, extractive brand Abenzine and petroleum distillates are used as solvents to extract oil from the raw plant materials. Extractive benzines belong to the aliphatic hydrocarbons, and are a mixture of saturated, unsaturated, and a small quantity of aromatic hydrocarbons. They have a boiling point of 63–95ºC. Benzines that contain aromatic hydrocarbons are good at dissolving not only oil, but also fatty substances (phospholipids, pigments, waxes), which degrade the quality of the oil. Then the nuts are dried, washed, and again dried for the purposes of later sale.</p>
<p>Any dietitian will tell you that products like these should not be consumed: they are hazardous to your health.</p>
<p><b>Here are few facts:</b></p>
<p>In 2006, in Moscow, for the first time in the centuries-old history of Russia, a large number of cases of food poisoning from pine nuts was recorded.</p>
<p>After a careful investigation, it was revealed that the pine nuts had been brought from China after processing.</p>
<p>That same year, the Russian government placed a ban on the import of pine nuts onto the territory of Russia. Thus, Russians discovered just what ""pine mouth"" was.</p>
<p>Many people suffer from this problem in the United States; here is an excerpt from an official FDA web-site<a href=""http://www.fda.gov/Food/RecallsOutbreaksEmergencies/SafetyAlertsAdvisories/ucm247099.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.fda.gov/Food/RecallsOutbreaksEmergencies/SafetyAlertsAdvisories/ucm247099.htm</a>:</p>
<p><i>In the past year FDA has received a number of consumer complaints regarding a bitter metallic taste associated with pine nuts. This taste, known as ""pine mouth,"" typically begins 12 to 48 hours after consuming pine nuts, and lasts on average between a few days and two weeks. It is exacerbated by consumption of any other food during this period and significantly decreases appetite and enjoyment of food.</i></p>
<p>In addition, anyone interested can familiarize themselves with the problem by typing pine mouth into any search engine.</p>
<p>Another problem is the corruption associated with the export of the nuts from Russia to China. Pursuant to Russian legislation, a special licence must be obtained to export nuts outside of Russia. According to official statistics, licences were issued in 2014-2015 for the export of only 100 tons of nuts, including the licence issued to our company. But according to the statistics kept by human rights organizations, including the World Wildlife Federation, more than twenty thousand tons of pine nuts were exported from Russia to China!</p>
<p>If you ask any pine nut harvester in Siberia, where the pine nuts are sold, you will be told that they are sold to China without any licences. This is possible because of certain people who, for a bribe, are prepared to transport any quantity of nuts across the border.</p>
<p>Because of corruption and production technologies that are hazardous to health, which the people processing the nuts fail to mention. Russian companies, including ours, do not even have a chance to deliver quality products when faced with the lowered prices and unscrupulous competition of Chinese producers.</p>
<p><b>Q: What about Italian pine nuts?</b></p>
<p>Italian pine nuts, off course, much better then Chinese ones, but they cannot be considered organic and wild harvested because they are grooving in artificial plantations in Italy and as any cultivated plant goes through fertilisation proses.</p>
<p>Also back in 1792 Academician P. S. Pallas has told us that the healing qualities of pine increase as one moves closer to the border of forest tundra. This means that the Siberian one is more powerful.</p>
<p>Other problem is freshness of Italian pine nuts, in any case it will take several month before you buy them in local store.</p>
<p>The main problem with Italian pine nuts, that they are grafted on fast growing, nutless pine tree. You can find many warnings from different sources about danger of grafted plants.</p>
<br/>
</div></div>","A team of brave people from Energy of Life Company, together with residents of local eco settlement,
are organizing an expedition to the taiga, and will deliver to your
table wholesome and fresh pine nuts within a period of two weeks after the nuts
have been shelled.
With your support we will make FRESH AND HEALING SIBERIAN PINE NUTS
TO BE YOUR LOCAL FOOD! 

Siberian pine nuts are completely organic and wild
harvested.  They contain no GMOs and come
from trees that have not been grafted. 
Pine nuts are 100% natural and pure, and may be called the King of Super
Foods.
Siberian pine nuts are the most
valuable product of all known products obtained from various plants.  On average, any product—whether nuts, fruits,
seeds, root vegetables, or berries—takes from three to five months to ripen,
and ripening does not occur during the winter. 
Pine nuts ripen over a period of two years, and are a much more valuable
product for human health.
Pine nuts may completely replace
any product, but there is no single product that can replace pine nuts.
Pine nuts have long been used in various cuisines of the
world; they are held in high regard for their unique taste and medicinal
properties.  With an amazing slightly
sweet taste containing hints of milk, pine nuts have been used both in main
dishes and desserts.  The nuts have
always been a delicacy and a much sought-after ingredient at the tables of
nobles and kings.  Modern science has
studied the chemical composition of pine nuts and explained their usefulness.
Pine nuts are the absolute
record-holders for containing the most vitamins.  For example, in one hundred grams of nuts
there are forty-eight recommended daily doses of high-quality vitamin B2; so,
to make up a deficiency of this vitamin, you only need to eat two grams of pine
nuts a day.  One hundred grams of pine
nuts also contain twenty-two recommended daily doses of natural vitamin B1, and
forty percent of the recommended daily dose of organic folic acid and vitamin PP.
With regard to minerals, pine nuts
are no less amazing.  Two hundred grams
of pine nuts contain the recommended daily dose of magnesium.  These nuts are also rich in potassium,
phosphorus, and copper.
The protein content of pine nuts
is much richer than chicken, pork or ham. 
Pine nuts also contain all amino acids, including the essential amino
acids, as well as those that are important for children, such as arginine and
histidine.  The balanced protein of pine
nuts is so close to the protein compounds of human tissue that 99% of this
protein is capable of being assimilated by the body.
Siberian pine nuts are a concentrated source of vitamins E
and P.  Vitamin E is a powerful
antioxidant, capable of neutralizing the oxidizing processes in the body.  As a result of its action, the level of blood
cholesterol is lowered, and the body is rejuvenated.
Pine nuts contain much more vitamin E than other popular
products, such as olive oil, wheat germ oil, or coconut oil.  Group E vitamins, or tocopherols, are very
important and essential for ensuring full transmission of genetic
material.  Translated from the Greek,
tocopheral means “I bear offspring.”
The most important and significant factor in pine nuts is
their content of up to 70% of valuable fats of plant origin of all three types:
saturated, monosaturated, and polyunsaturated, including a high quantity of the
rarest, and therefore the most valuable fatty acid, Omega-3.  Omega-3 and Omega-6 are contained in pine
nuts in an ideal proportion, practically 1:1
Popular scientific literature also points out that the
quality of pine growing in Northern areas is much higher than those in the
South. Back in 1792 academician P. S. Pallas wrote that the Siberian pine nuts
rejuvenate man's power. They also bring back youthfulness, stimulate the immune
system considerably, increasing the physical body's resistance against many
diseases. World history knows a great number of historical phenomena directly
or indirectly connected with pine. Here is one of them. A half literate
countryman, Gregory Rasputin, from a remote Siberian village, was from the
region where Siberian pine grows. He came to Moscow in 1907 when he was already
50 years of age. He startled the royal family, where he was heartily welcomed,
because of his prophecies; He was sexually involved with many distinguished
ladies. Those who were trying to kill him were shocked by the fact that having
been hit by many bullets, he was still alive. His vitality was amazing. The
secret was that he had been brought up in the region where pine grows and he
had been fed on pine nuts. The journalists of that period summarized his
endurance: “At 50 years of age, he could start an orgy at noon, continuing his
drunken ordeals till 4 a. m. After erotic involvement and drinking heavily he
went right to church for morning services where he prayed till 8 a.m. After
returning home, he drank a lot of tea as if nothing had happened before,
Grishka received visitors till 2 p.m. Then accompanied by a group of ladies, he
went to a Russian bathhouse with a steamer and then went directly to a suburban
restaurant. There he repeated the previous night's performance. No ordinary man
could possibly stand up to that kind of routine”. Today, the several times
world and Olympic champion in wrestling Alexander Karelin, is also a Siberian,
again from the region where Siberian pine grows. The strong man has eaten pine
nuts all his life.
What we want to do.
A team of brave people from Energy of Life Company, together with
residents of local eco settlement, are organizing an expedition to the
taiga, and will deliver, to your table, wholesome and fresh pine nuts within a
period of two weeks after the nuts have been shelled.
We collect pine cones that have
fallen to the ground by themselves, which ensures a harvest of only ripened
cones.
We take the entire cone out of the
forest.  Nuts in their cones can be kept
for up to three years without any loss of quality.
In the warehouse, we use commercial refrigerators, which
ensure the preservation of all the nutritional substances in the pine nut.
After the nuts have been shelled, they are immediately
vacuum-packed, which protects the pine nuts from the oxidizing effect of the
surrounding air.  In addition, the
packaging we use does not contain chlorine.
We do not wait until we have
processed all the nuts, but ship out pine nuts in small batches to warehouses
in America, Canada, and Germany.
Our warehouses are equipped with commercial freezers, which
ensure the maximum preservation of the pine nuts.
Pine nuts are shipped from Russia to America only by airline
over the course of two days and only in thermally insulated containers.
Mail delivery of orders is by expedited service.
No more than two weeks goes by
from the instant we shell the cones until the time you receive the wholesome
pine nuts!  And in these two weeks the
nuts are refrigerated.
After you receive your pine nuts, they must be kept in a
refrigerator.  For longer storage, the
nuts must be placed in a freezer, where they can be kept for up to twelve
months without any loss of quality.
Why we come up with
this idea

We are big fans of pine nuts, for extensive period of time we try to find fresh
Siberian pine nuts in stores. We go through different health food stores in every
states which we visit by occasion, we search all internet sites including eBay
and Amazon, the best which we found was Italian pine nuts, all other was from
China (the main difference between Siberian, Chinese and Italian pine nuts you
can find below in FAQ).  All of
them were far away from Siberian nuts by the quality, taste and health effect.

We start to think on an idea how to bring healthy Siberian pine nuts to USA.  Our team strongly believe that the residents
of greatest country of the world, should have the best products from all over
the world, including Siberian pine nuts. 
We decide that healing Siberian pine nut will be our team contribution to the bright
future of our great country.  

Our team try to cooperate with grocery and organic stores chains.
During the
last year our administrators contacted various grocery chain stores to offer
fresh pine nuts coming directly from Siberia for realization. However, we
received the same reply from the stores: “Chinese suppliers offer cheaper pine
nuts”. All our reasoning about low quality and non-fresh pine nuts which might
be even dangerous for consumption was dismissed on the ground of unmerciful
thesis: “The customers are interested in cheap price first of all, as cheaper
as better. The quality is not that important.”
We will never agree with such statement. We believe
that every person wants to consume only high quality products and obtain health
benefits from them. We’ve decided to address directly to the consumers and
offer high quality, fresh Siberian pine nuts. 

Our
team developed a plan that can radically change the situation.
However, we need your financial support in order to
implement a unique and highly productive distribution system – direct marketing
of Siberian pine nuts in North America.
All initial financing will be applied to organizing
the expedition in Siberian taiga and processing machinery acquisition,
including:
- 
Off-road
vehicle with extra low pressure tires for carrying pine nuts out of taiga which
will not damage topsoil (unfortunately there are not roads inside taiga
forests)
- 
Shelling
machinery for pine cones and pine nuts
- 
Packing
machinery for packaging the pine nuts into vacuum bags
- 
Additional
commercial freezers
Also substantial financing is required for air
transportation of pine nuts to North America. 
We've
already accomplished much:
- 
We rented
ecologically pure section of taiga for harvesting pine nuts.
- 
We received a
special license which allows to export pine nuts outside of Russia.
- 
We developed a
unique system of direct marketing which allows delivering pine nuts directly to
our customers within 2 weeks from the pine nut processing.  
We apply procedures that protect
the forest; our technologies for processing pine nuts are the best in the
world; the delivery system we have developed is one of the fastest and most
sophisticated; our direct-marketing technology excludes a chain of middle-men,
which makes it possible to offer you the best price.We are making an agreement with American company SIBERIAN PINES - a leading distributor of pine products in North America - to be our guarantor and selling agent.SIBERIAN PINES company has been operating in North America since 2003 and has refrigerated warehouses in Detroit, MI, USA; Toronto, ON, Canada; Dusseldorf, Germany.

We need your support to make fresh
and healing Siberian Pine Nuts to be locally available food!
You will enjoy all the health
benefits from Siberian pine nuts—the King of super foods—as local Siberians
have been doing for a millennium.

If you ask any pine nut harvester in Siberia, where the pine nuts are sold, you will be told that they are sold to China without any licences. This is possible because of certain people who, for a bribe, are prepared to transport any quantity of nuts across the border.
Because of corruption and production technologies that are hazardous to health, which the people processing the nuts fail to mention. Russian companies, including ours, do not even have a chance to deliver quality products when faced with the lowered prices and unscrupulous competition of Chinese producers.
Q: What about Italian pine nuts?
Italian pine nuts, off course, much better then Chinese ones, but they cannot be considered organic and wild harvested because they are grooving in artificial plantations in Italy and as any cultivated plant goes through fertilisation proses.
Also back in 1792 Academician P. S. Pallas has told us that the healing qualities of pine increase as one moves closer to the border of forest tundra. This means that the Siberian one is more powerful.
Other problem is freshness of Italian pine nuts, in any case it will take several month before you buy them in local store.
The main problem with Italian pine nuts, that they are grafted on fast growing, nutless pine tree. You can find many warnings from different sources about danger of grafted plants.",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

Although it had the great potential of being a successful business, she wanted to get back into education, and so closed Romeo's Pizza for good in 2004. That summer, she fell in love with Steven, and he fell in love with her (and her pizza!) Over the next eleven years, they worked together with ""at risk"" teenagers and young adults (five years out of their own home), specializing in life skills. Meal times were always a place to come together, debrief the day, and share great food. Pizza night was especially popular! Although this business also had the great potential of being successful, we never recovered from the financial crisis of 2008 and so, with much dismay, decided to dissolve our transition program in 2013. Pondering ""what's next?"", Steven came up with the idea of running a mobile wood fired pizza business...the seeds were being planted.</p><p>Away from Sandpoint for seven years, we moved back in July of 2015. Every day we would run into various people around town who would continuously ask Elissa if she was going to make pizza again. With so much support from such an awesome community, Elissa began to warm up to Steven's idea. Then one night, after watching the movie ""Chef"" (about a family who works together in a mobile food truck), Elissa turned to Steven and said, ""That looks like fun! Let's do it!"" And so we went to Denver for three days of wood fired pizza university (thank you ""Fire Within"") and drove home with our new pizza trailer! </p><p>For six months, we worked out many kinks through all the elements of North Idaho selling pies to the 1st through 8th grade students at the Sandpoint Waldorf School as a fundraiser for the 8th grade class trip. We opened full time in June at a mobile food court and traveled around A LOT to various events all around town. The result? Many happy locals and tourists, from Sandpoint lifers to grandparents visiting from Spain, enjoying that Olde World flavor, gathering around our fire, and walking away with full bellies and many smiles.</p><p><strong>Why is Mandala Pizza going to be successful?</strong></p><p>Recently we received our highest compliment: ""I feel like I just stepped off the bus in Sicily! This pizza tastes exactly like it does there. You've nailed it!"" We are the only chefs in town that offer wood fired, Napolitana-style, and mobile pizza. We import our flour, tomatoes, prosciutto, and Parmesan from Italy. All of our pies are made fresh on the spot, and are free of GMO's, hormones, antibiotics, nitrates, and pesticides. We support local farmers. But, what really makes our pizza taste oh so good is the amount of love and good intentions we infuse into our food.</p><p>The word ""mandala"" means ""round"" in Sanskrit, but on a deeper level means""offering"". So, we make and serve ""round offerings"" with the intention that they benefit all living beings. Our long term goal is to donate a portion of our profits to help underprivileged Nepali students go to school. How awesome is that? Thank you for considering an offering to us so that we may continue to make offerings to others!</p><p><strong>Where will the money go and what are the risks?</strong></p><p>All the funds raised will go towards paying off the cost of our mobile, wood-fired pizza trailer. Yes, it is one spendy trailer, but the quality cannot be surpassed. The oven frames are made in Italy, designed specifically to be mobile, and then shipped to Fort Collins, CO to be finished and custom mounted on the trailer of your choice. We went for the deluxe version so that we could travel to any event and be completely self-contained. Our trailer has ample storage space under the oven, a space to dolly on and off our prep table with refrigeration, and a triple sink. We can hook up to power and water or run off of our generator. After operating this trailer for the past year, we can honestly say that we are 100% satisfied with our choice!</p><p>The risk of all businesses is that they will fail. Of course, as human beings, this thought has gone through our brains too, but after seeing how great of a summer we had (and nearly every other person asking us, ""Where's your restaurant?""), there's not a doubt in our minds that we will be successful.

<div>Youth unemployment often exceeds 80% among poor communities in South Africa, this making the lure of crime incredibly high. Often it is the responsibility of the youth to look after their direct and indirect family, yet there are few jobs, and certainly even fewer which can pay enough to allow families to support themselves. This means that even tough who are punished for committing crimes often resort back to crime as it is the only sustainable way they see to make money.</div>
<div><h3>BrothersForAll to save the day!!!</h3></div>
<div>While the government may have failed the people of South Africa, <b>BrothersForAll </b>have stepped up to fill the void. They are a small nonprofit organisation making big waves in the community of Langa and around South Africa. </div>
<div>Started and run by Sihle Tshabalala the organisation seeks to change lives by teaching programming and web design skills to anyone who walks into their centre, and to a select group of prisoners at a few prisons in the Western Cape. </div>
<div>The only way to reduce crime and the reoffending rate is through education, and only by educating those people will the correct, real world applicable skills will they be able to help themselves and help each other out of the situations they find themselves in. <b>(<a href=""www.brothersforall.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.brothersforall.org</a>)</b>
</div>
<div><h3>How do I fit in</h3></div> <p>I am an embedded software engineer who has fallen in love with everyone at the <b>BrothersForAll</b> centre. I have a passion for programming and technology and I am a firm believer in teaching a man to fish!</p>
<p>The learners and mentors at the <b>BrothersForAll</b> centre are the most passionate people I have ever met, They spend every conceivable hour there every day, some working tirelessly from 8am - 10pm, 7 days a week to learn and teach each other about programming and life, it is truly inspiring. </p>
<p>I have taken it upon myself to raise funds and awareness for <b>BrothersForAll</b> so they may continue to change lives, and so they do not need to worry about where the next slice of funds will come from. To do this I have chosen to climb <b>Kilimanjaro!!! </b></p>
<p><i>I am all booked and paid up to hike from 25 September until 2 October 2015, and will be tackling the mountain via the Machame route! :)</i></p>
<p></p>
<h2>Why Kilimanjaro?</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Kilimanjaro is the highest freestanding mountain in the World, and is one of Africa's greatest mountaineering challenges! While I climb to raise the <b>BrothersForAll</b> flag from the top of Africa, I will know that men and woman are heard at work at the <b>BrothersForAll</b> to tackle one of Africa's biggest socio-economic challenges!

<p></p><h3>Why Local</h3>

The Specialty Coffee Association of America (SCAA) reports that there are over 29,300 independent coffeehouse retailers in the US.<br/><br/><p>Corporate chains continue to infiltrate communities defacing the character of US towns with cookie-cutter layouts and corporate culture. This may sound dramatic, but it is important to be aware of the fact that mom-n-pops are being pushed out every day. Our app helps local economies thrive by making local business easier to find wherever you are.</p>
<br/>
<h3>Why Coffee and Coffeehouses</h3>
<p>Our founder, Lisa McIntyre, has personally visited hundreds of 
locally-owned and operated coffeehouses and micro-roasters and has had 
many one-on-one discussions with the owners and managers. She learned 
that these entrepreneurs tend to be more involved in their own 
local communities. They participate in community happenings, often 
provide the venue for community gatherings and are always conscious of 
how they can and do give back. Coffeehouses truly are a pinnacle of 
their communities.</p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444340896/pmnvyi0lld1hledxr3mv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Lisa also discovered that the owners express their unique interests and 
passions inside and out of the hand crafted environments they’ve built. 
This offers a unique experience for every customer. Here are just a few 
examples of some of the creativity and passion that breathes in these 
local businesses: <br/></p><ul>
<li>A fabulous coffeehouse in Dubois, WY displays a wall of fallen soldiers from the region,<br/>
</li>
<li>A coffeehouse in Denver, CO changes your oil while you relax over a cappuccino. <br/>
</li>
<li>A coffeehouse and laundromat in Portland, OR provides state-of-the-art washers and dryers amid artistic strings of found socks. <br/>
</li>
</ul><p>Brick and mortar coffeehouses, cafes and roasters bring people 
together, however the coffee itself is also central to American culture. 
We wake 
up to our cup of coffee each morning. Coffee is part of every office 
meeting and social gathering. It also expresses itself (with the help of
 java-obsessed people) creatively when growing, harvesting, roasting and
preparing the perfect cup. <br/>
</p><h3>The Impact: The Local Coffeehouse Guide Benefits Local Business</h3><h3>
</h3>
<p>
</p><p>The App and Website level the
playing field, Little Shop vs. National Chain, by acting as a marketing
department (so to speak) for the independently owned business members in the
directory. This is facilitated by providing them with free listings in the
directory as well as custom tailored robust marketing tools that will
significantly increase their online and mobile visibility in their surrounding
areas and nationally.  Their listings alone, combined with the multi-platform
national marketing of the app and website will allow these small businesses to
compete more effectively as a community of small businesses against corporate
chains. This level of visibility and exposure would typically be unattainable
for most small businesses to achieve on their own.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439448903/qc1veh3y1gwkriw1javg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p></p>
<p>A FREE claimed listing provides a
retail location with the following on both the mobile app and website:</p>
<ul>
<li>A map marker that automatically geo-locates the user.</li>
<li>A listing that displays their information; address
     with a link to directions from the user's current location, a link to the
     retailer's desired URL, a photo of their location and a place to share
     their story or a brief description of their location.</li>
<li>We highly encourage our retailers to share their
     personal story in order to really connect with people even before they
     walk through the door. This feature truly separates us from the rest.</li>
</ul>
<p>The additional tools we offer our
members are push notes to app users in their area, searchable defining
characteristics (gluten free, patio, drive-thru, etc), animated map markers to
draw extra attention to their location, and much more. </p>
<p>In early 2016 we will be offering
three levels of paid membership which include the claimed listing
specifications (above) complimented with the additional tools (i.e. push notes,
categories, and animated markers). Also in early 2016 we will be offering all
of our tools a la carte to members as well. To learn more about our membership
programs and the tools for retailers, please visit our <a href=""http://thelocalcoffeehouse.com/membership-levels/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>membership page. <br/></span></a></p>

<h3>The Local Coffeehouse Guide Benefits Coffee Drinkers</h3><h3>
</h3>

specialty shops nearby - anywhere in the US from the palm of their hand.</p>
<p>The app locates the consumer then
provides an on-map display and list of all the coffeehouses, cafes and
micro-roasters nearest them. It's perfect for travelers exploring a new town or
for local residents interested in pursuing a new local experience in their own
communities.</p>

<h3>Early Achievements</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Local Coffeehouse Guide App

<ul>
<li>Native App Build iOS and Android: The platform we
     currently use to house the mobile app is extremely limited for

     it is crucial for the success of the app that we begin a native build
     immediately before the business outgrows the current platform.</li>
<li>E-Commerce for the App: Development and implementation
     of a store for <b>users </b>to
     purchase The Local Coffeehouse Guide promotional items. (Postcards, coffee
     mugs, micro-roast coffee club, etc.)</li>

</h3>
<p><a href=""http://thelocalcoffeehouse.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style='letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;' target=""_blank"">The Local Coffeehouse Guide</a> is the brainchild of <a href=""https://about.me/lisarmcintyre"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lisa McIntyre</a>. Her passion for local gathering places began as a child in her grandparent's bakery. For thirty years, Ray &amp; Lottie Filer were devoted to their business and the (then) small community of Glendale, Arizona. They worked 15 hours a day to provide handmade breads, pastries and wedding cakes to their neighbors and friends. They lived in the 1 bedroom apartment above their bakery for many years until they could afford a house separate from the business. These small family businesses are part of America's economic and cultural history. Lisa sees these ""mom-and-pops"" as a central part of our future as well, as we seek reprieve from corporate ""sameness"" and relish neighborhood gathering places.</p>
<p>Lisa is a mother, an adventurer, an angler, a writer and entrepreneur who loves to travel and explore the back roads of America. She is a minimalist and currently ""lives small"" in the Mile High City of Denver, Colorado USA, the world headquarters of The Local Coffeehouse Guide.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439444449/jbtvvwqq9lrbedrrq4nr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Coffeehouses are essential gathering places in each community across the map. These little spots give locals an intimate place to share art, conversation, and music; to hold fundraising events, to play board games, to study and to work. </p><p>While on her travels, Lisa discovered that finding these local spots was a huge challenge, even when asking locals where to go. She came up with the idea of The Local Coffeehouse Guide App and Website to make all of them easy to locate, right from the palm of your hand.</p>
<p>Lisa has devoted countless hours over the past several years to developing the App and Website, and worked many part-time and full-time jobs to bootstrap the launch of The Local Coffeehouse Guide. Now, however, it's time to play big.</p>
<br/>
<h3>Co-Founder - Guinivere Stevenson</h3><p>In September of 2013, Guinivere joined Lisa as a contributing partner of
 The Local Coffeehouse Guide. Since then she has worked alongside Lisa 
in the development of a sustainable business model catering to 
independent, locally owned coffeehouses, cafes and micro-roasters 
throughout the United States. Together they have worked tirelessly to 
create, build and fund The Local Coffeehouse Guide App to its present 
state.<br/></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pub/guinivere-stevenson/23/5a2/173"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Guinivere Stevenson</a> began her career in marketing/advertising in 1997 with advertising sales in newspaper, radio and magazine. In 1998 Guinivere was invited to sit on the Marketing Board of the Steamboat Springs Chamber of Commerce, the governing body of the Summer Advertising Campaigns of the town of Steamboat Springs, Colorado. Additionally, throughout '97-'05 Guinivere was contracted/employed for the role of Marketing Director of a non-profit health organization, a retail cooperative, a coal mine training and consulting business, and a historic Denver nightclub.</p>

<p>In 2005, Guinivere began her journey in film-making; in 2007 she 
returned to college to get her Bachelors in Fine Arts with an emphasis 
in Film Writing and Direction at the University of Colorado Denver. 
Since 2005, she has produced/directed a number of short narrative films,
 two documentaries (both short and feature length), a web series, a

Buying Local Just Got a Whole Lot Easier!
The Mobile App and Website (the only local business driven app) provides a dynamic, searchable, mapping platform for users to effortlessly locate unique, independently owned coffeehouses and micro-roasters across the United States. Coffeehouses and micro-roasters are popping up all over America begging to be discovered! 

             

The Local Coffeehouse Guide App and Website offers a nationwide map displaying the location information of coffeehouses, cafes and micro-rosters. This not only provides retailers with local visibility but with national visibility as well. Additionally, consumers can easily find these independent businesses and ultimately support the local economies they live in and visit. Let's give local business a fighting chance by significantly improving the interface of The Local Coffeehouse Guide App and Website!

Why Local

The Specialty Coffee Association of America (SCAA) reports that there are over 29,300 independent coffeehouse retailers in the US.Corporate chains continue to infiltrate communities defacing the character of US towns with cookie-cutter layouts and corporate culture. This may sound dramatic, but it is important to be aware of the fact that mom-n-pops are being pushed out every day.

Lisa also discovered that the owners express their unique interests and 
passions inside and out of the hand crafted environments they’ve built. 
This offers a unique experience for every customer. Here are just a few 
examples of some of the creativity and passion that breathes in these 
local businesses: 
A fabulous coffeehouse in Dubois, WY displays a wall of fallen soldiers from the region,

A coffeehouse in Denver, CO changes your oil while you relax over a cappuccino. 

A coffeehouse and laundromat in Portland, OR provides state-of-the-art washers and dryers amid artistic strings of found socks. 

Brick and mortar coffeehouses, cafes and roasters bring people

     monetization, conversion tracking, advertising and marketing. Therefore,
     it is crucial for the success of the app that we begin a native build
     immediately before the business outgrows the current platform.
E-Commerce for the App: Development and implementation
     of a store for users to
     purchase The Local Coffeehouse Guide promotional items. (Postcards, coffee
     mugs, micro-roast coffee club, etc.)
E-Commerce for the Website: Development and
     implementation of an online store for retailer’s
     only (outside of membership packages) offering marketing tools and
     promotional items. 
Website Overhaul: Acquisition of a professional web
     development team to streamline the website with special attention to
     retailer membership, e-commerce, content, general design and SEO
     maximization.
Advertising & Marketing: Acquisition of agency
     representation for on-going regional and national campaigns.

Native App Build for iOS and Android: $40,000
E-Commerce for App & Website: $3,000

supporting local economies nationwide. 



Founder - Lisa McIntyre

The Local Coffeehouse Guide is the brainchild of Lisa McIntyre. Her passion for local gathering places began as a child in her grandparent's bakery. For thirty years, Ray & Lottie Filer were devoted to their business and the (then) small community of Glendale, Arizona. They worked 15 hours a day to provide handmade breads, pastries and wedding cakes to their neighbors and friends. They lived in the 1 bedroom apartment above their bakery for many years until they could afford a house separate from the business. These small family businesses are part of America's economic and cultural history. Lisa sees these ""mom-and-pops"" as a central part of our future as well, as we seek reprieve from corporate ""sameness"" and relish neighborhood gathering places.
Lisa is a mother, an adventurer, an angler, a writer and entrepreneur who loves to travel and explore the back roads of America. She is a minimalist and currently ""lives small"" in the Mile High City of Denver, Colorado USA, the world headquarters of The Local Coffeehouse Guide.

Coffeehouses are essential gathering places in each community across the map. These little spots give locals an intimate place to share art, conversation, and music; to hold fundraising events, to play board games, to study and to work. While on her travels, Lisa discovered that finding these local spots was a huge challenge, even when asking locals where to go. She came up with the idea of The Local Coffeehouse Guide App and Website to make all of them easy to locate, right from the palm of your hand.
Lisa has devoted countless hours over the past several years to developing the App and Website, and worked many part-time and full-time jobs to bootstrap the launch of The Local Coffeehouse Guide. Now, however, it's time to play big.

Co-Founder - Guinivere StevensonIn September of 2013, Guinivere joined Lisa as a contributing partner of
 The Local Coffeehouse Guide. Since then she has worked alongside Lisa 
in the development of a sustainable business model catering to 
independent, locally owned coffeehouses, cafes and micro-roasters 
throughout the United States. Together they have worked tirelessly to 
create, build and fund The Local Coffeehouse Guide App to its present 
state.
Guinivere Stevenson began her career in marketing/advertising in 1997 with advertising sales in newspaper, radio and magazine. In 1998 Guinivere was invited to sit on the Marketing Board of the Steamboat Springs Chamber of Commerce, the governing body of the Summer Advertising Campaigns of the town of Steamboat Springs, Colorado. Additionally, throughout '97-'05 Guinivere was contracted/employed for the role of Marketing Director of a non-profit health organization, a retail cooperative, a coal mine training and consulting business, and a historic Denver nightclub.

In 2005, Guinivere began her journey in film-making; in 2007 she 
returned to college to get her Bachelors in Fine Arts with an emphasis 
in Film Writing and Direction at the University of Colorado Denver. 
Since 2005, she has produced/directed a number of short narrative films,
 two documentaries (both short and feature length), a web series, a 
music video and roughly one hundred promotional, educational and 
commercial videos. She also owns and operates ArchedBrow Productions, a 
production company in Denver, Colorado that specializes in 
commercial/corporate videos for broadcast and online streaming.
