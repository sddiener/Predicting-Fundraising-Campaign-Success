<h3>Campaign summary</h3> <p></p>
<p>Handmade by Dafne is a Greek brand of unique
handcrafted fashion accessories. Established by myself -Dafne- 6 years ago, with no capital but my own passion for what I do and the support of friends and customers who love my things. It has grown over the years to become our family's sole income source and my products have up to now been sold in shops allover Greece. However, this summer the Greek market has altogether stopped functioning. This is why I need your support to collect the funds that will allow me to participate in an international trade show and put my brand on the global market.</p>

<p>I made my first bag at the age of 5. When I was 10, I borrowed a neighbors sewing machine and saved my weekly allowances to buy a Burda magazine and fabrics and made a dress for my mum and shirt for my dad. That's how I got my first sewing machine! On that same machine I then sewed slings for my babies when I became a mum. I soon had requests from other parents and thus baby slings became my first marketable product and 'Handmade by Dafne' was born. Since then my product range has grown to include bags, backpacks, clutches, purses, earrings, rings pendants, nursing pillows and things for the home as cushions, aprons, bunting and lavender filled hearts.</p>
<p>I screen print my own designs by hand using the most eco friendly inks available – they are Soil Association Certified as Organic Textile Standard and parts of the production are powered by the sun and the wind. Almost all work is done by me – from the design and printing, the actual sewing, packaging and marketing. I have the support of my partner, a skilled graphic designer whose parents once owned a small industry producing athletics apparel.This has given me insights, extensive know how, connections and experiences that have been valuable for the quick development of my business.  </p>
<p>Each product is carefully handcrafted with love in my country studio.</p>

<h3>Why I am crowd funding </h3> <p></p>
<p> The reason I am using crowdfunding is to keep my
business alive. The only viable solution  for me at this point, given the deep rooted crisis in Greece, is to open up to the
global market.  To do this, I need to participate in an
international trade show. The trade show where my products can reach
a global clientele is the Premiere Classe trade show in Paris as it
supports my style and attracts over 50000 visitors from across the globe. My presence at the fair will cost some 9240 euros in total (exhibition space,  basic transport and accommodation) and that's what I am trying to raise
through this campaign. </p>
<p>I have already  been accepted to the Premiere Classe and was planning to participate. My full Spring-Summer 2016 collection has been designed and produced. However, the current state of the Greek market does not allow me to raise the funds  which is why I am crowdfunding.</p>

In response to demand from a growing section of the population who believe their views are routinely ignored, or even ridiculed, by the mainstream media we vowed to create a new high quality publication free from negativity, bias and condescension.


We promised to deliver a platform to showcase the achievements of Scotland and its people, to identify problems and debate the solutions to create a better, fairer and more inclusive society.



Our aim was to produce a monthly, professional publication which would appeal to a wide domestic and international audience; to demonstrate that as a nation we are far from being “too poor, too wee or too stupid”, as elements of the mainstream media would have us believe. Scotland is a dynamic and forward thinking country with a rich heritage worth celebrating.We believe we have delivered on that promise!
Some of the comments and reviews on social media about iScot include:
""A fascinating, uplifting and very informative read""
""Thanks for all you're doing for the people of Scotland""
""Excellent - better than The National"" (sorry guys :-))



iScot magazine is a pro-Scotland publication. As such it appeals to people who would not otherwise engage with purely political websites. Our mix of content has attracted a wide audience and opened the eyes of many to subjects they would previously have been unaware of.

In the last nine months we have covered a huge range of topics. We have highlighted concerns over fracking, nuclear weapons and political intrigue. We have given a voice to families and campaigners fighting for justice. 
We have promoted Scottish businesses; championed inventiveness; celebrated culture and showcased Scotland to the world. 
All of this has been done alongside spectacular photo spreads, celebrity interviews, aspirational features and regular columns from the likes of Wee Ginger Dug, MajorBloodnok and Will Mcleod’s Letter from America.   Even the First Minister has written for iScot.
Our audience has grown organically every month, mostly as a result of word-of-mouth recommendations and a limited amount of social-media promotion.
We are the only independent grassroots pro-Scotland publication available in newsagents. But, if we are to compete against the stranglehold of the mainstream media we need to reach more people and increase our editorial coverage.
It is time to expand and we would like your help to do it!
iScot is looking to raise funds to help improve our services and reach a wider audience. We have two main funding requirements(1) We will use the money raised to invest in more quality content. There are numerous worthy topics and subjects all too often ignored by the MSM which rail against the established view which deserve to be covered, investigated and published. To do this properly we need to recruit the services of more journalists, photographers, video makers, broadcasters and professional experts. The majority of our funding will be allocated to these activities.(2) We need to launch a national advertising campaign to make more people aware of the magazine, and its positive view of Scotland and its people.  Many people don't have access to social media and rely instead on traditional MSM print and broadcast sources for information.  iScot needs to advertise its presence to that audience to offer an alternate view.
If we reach our funding target, we aim to increase the profile of iScot by producing the first ever crowd funded TV advert for an independent pro Scotland publication.  This will be done in advance of the 2016 elections.

</p><p><b>Short Summary</b></p>
<p>My name
is Flavia Ursa, I am 23 years old and I was born in Romania. I completed my
undergraduate degree at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, where I
studied Psychology. During the four years spent there, I discovered the
important part that research plays in the field in order to improve our
understanding of the human mind and to find ways of treating mental disorders.
I have done numerous internships in children's and adult's psychiatric
hospitals in Romania, as well a summer in Ghana in a Psychiatric Hospital. I
worked as a research assistant in the Psychology department at my University,
where I learned the practical side of research. </p>
<p>Throughout
my studies and extracurricular activities I have found that my passion lies in
clinical and forensic research, and applied for a Master's program in research
at Lund University, Sweden. I have been here for a bit over one semester, and
my studies have gone very well. I am very happy with the academic training I am
receiving, and I feel the program provides the stepping stones I need in
reaching my goal of becoming a researcher. I have received top grades for my
Statistics and Methodology class, and already started planning my Master's
thesis that will be conducted in a clinical setting with one of the top
researchers in the department as my supervisors. </p>
<p>The only
negative side of studying in Sweden is the fact that it is a very expensive
country. Even though I don't have to pay tuition fees, being from a European
Union country, the living costs are very high. My home country, Romania,
unfortunately does not provide any kind of financial support to its students,
and I don't qualify for any Swedish scholarships or grants. During my undergraduate
studies in the United Kingdom I have had part-time jobs in bars and restaurants
in order to support myself, but here it has been impossible to get one due to
the fact I don't know Swedish. My family is unable to support me owing to the
large difference in income and spending between Romania and Sweden.</p>
<p>Thus, my
aim is to try to identify ways of funding my living costs for the remaining
four months of the first year of Master's studies. I am very passionate and
driven, and I refuse to believe money issues can hamper my education. Through
your help, I can continue focusing on my studies, getting highly skilled in
research, and acquiring the theoretical and practical knowledge that will
ensure I get the job I've been working towards. </p>
<p><b>What I Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>I have
four months left of this academic year. The Swedish government informs students
the minimum amount of money they need is SEK 7,800 (approx. EUR 850) per month.
This is corroborated by my experience of living here these previous months. This
is what a breakdown of my monthly budget looks like:</p>
<table>

<p>Rent</p>

<p>SEK

<p>Total</p>

<p>SEK

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Thus, I have decided to set a
goal of EUR 3,500, that also covers Indiegogo fees.<br/>
<br/>
With your help, I can get by in the next four months. In return, I shall
update my blog about my life is Sweden weekly. Through it, I'm hoping to
provide some first-hand insight on being an international student in Sweden to
prospective students, as well as information on the course I'm taking, and
psychology in general. For higher contributors, I will write short review
papers on a psychology topic of your choice or send essays on specific
interesting topics I've researched and written about. The information will be
corroborated scientifically and obtained solely from trustworthy research
journals. Even if I don't reach my goal, covering any small part of my living
costs will be of great help.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Psychology
is a relatively new discipline, and a lot of research is still needed in the
field. Mental illness is only now beginning to be recognized and accepted in
the Western world, and many awareness campaigns have improved the public
knowledge on the subject. But there is so much still to be learned about the
brain, and about the best ways of treating mental illness that affect so many
people worldwide. I consider that I can make a difference. My main area of
interest is the effect of childhood abuse on mental well-being, and antisocial
personality disorder.  I have already written review papers on the
subject, and know the imperative need to stop such abuses, but also how vital
it is to find ways of helping such children recover and develop in a healthy
manner, and not perpetuate the circle of abuse.</p>
<p>I
consider education is the most empowering tool that exists, and everybody
should have access to education without having to worry about not being able to
pay the rent, buy books, or food. While at the moment I am the one in need of
help, this experience has opened my eyes to such issues, and I have promised
myself to help others in my situation in the future.</p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>Studying
abroad is a real challenge. Studying abroad with no financial stability is a
lot more taxing on one's mental health and optimism. Even so, I have found I am
strong enough to take each challenge one step at a time, and strive to find
solutions. I do not give up. I realise that even if I reach my goal, my second
year will still not be covered. I plan on working full-time this summer to be
able to cover at least some of the costs for the next academic year. My Swedish
will also improve considerably until then, since I am studying by myself and
will also take a Swedish language course provided by the University. Thus, my
prospects for finding a part-time job will also improve, especially since I
have solid experience in the hospitality business from my time in St Andrews.
Therefore, I consider that although there are some challenges I will most
definitely have to face, I have proved to myself on numerous occasions I will
be able to surpass them.</p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>I
understand not everyone has the financial means to contribute through
donations. You would be doing me a great favour just by sharing my campaign.
Thank you very much! </p>

Like how much more broke can I seem? Okay, I’m not entirely broke, just semi-broke. Like I can splurge on some Chinese food and BBQ here and there after going through some rough nights studying @ the ASU library while listening to Britney Spears. </span></p><p></p><p>So I totally need to figure out how to pay off my tuition approximately by the beginning of May at the latest. I mean, the earlier the better. What’s the cost? I need a grand total of $6,545 for tuition alone. Yikes, I know! The passport is about $200 and maybe some change (cause they like to charge extra money for “handling” it). The plane ticket? Oh golly, that’s like $1,900 separately. Yeah, I know that’s basically a mortgage payment. And then extra spending money to eat because they actually don’t feed you every meal on this trip.

I’m Gandalf (Nichelle).I need to get out of this desert full of dumb roadrunners getting caught in my tires. I rather swim with dolphins and walk around barefoot like a real Hobbit studying Lord of The Rings in New Zealand!So my story is this: I totally can’t receive enough loans, scholarships, and grants to cover this study abroad experience through Arizona State University for this July summer semester. I’m over here eating Ramen noodles and spaghetti all the time. However, I do love me some spaghetti! I’ve been collecting printer cartridges, cans, and plastic bottles too. Like how much more broke can I seem? Okay, I’m not entirely broke, just semi-broke. Like I can splurge on some Chinese food and BBQ here and there after going through some rough nights studying @ the ASU library while listening to Britney Spears. So I totally need to figure out how to pay off my tuition approximately by the beginning of May at the latest. I mean, the earlier the better. What’s the cost? I need a grand total of $6,545 for tuition alone. Yikes, I know! The passport is about $200 and maybe some change (cause they like to charge extra money for “handling” it). The plane ticket? Oh golly, that’s like $1,900 separately. Yeah, I know that’s basically a mortgage payment. And then extra spending money to eat because they actually don’t feed you every meal on this trip. I’m only basically fundraising the tuition portion since I applied for over 20 scholarships and grants thus far. Might have to sell a kidney while I'm at it.Impossible to get these things? Nope. Inconvenient to get them in short times notice? Totally. I don’t know how this fundraising crowdfunding stuff really even works. I feel like it’s simpler than what I make it to be in my mind. I’m old school and don’t really like using technological things. But I’ll be darned if I have to travel in someone’s suitcase illegally to New Zealand if I can’t reach this goal.So here’s what I’m proposing: help a college girl out to become more cultural diverse and educated overseas.

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>TERRA DACICA AETERNA</strong> is the first association in Romania which addresses the reenactment related with the ancient period. Historical reenactment is a way through which the history is literally “re-lived” by manufacturing clothing, weapons, tools, households, which the reenactment enthusiasts (re-enactors) use during some moments more or less directed. Manufacturing the equipment is done by studying historical sources relating to the period of time that needs to be “revived” so that everything is as close to the reality of those times as it can be.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The historical period chosen by us to be presented to the public is the one in which military conflicts took place between the Dacians, Romans and Sarmatians, which approximately accounts for the period between the 1st century BC to the 2nd century AD. As a result, three main groups are present within the association: the Dacians, the Romans and the Sarmatians. Aside from these groups, the equipment of some of the allies of these peoples have been recreated within the association, such as the the Celts, the Burs, the Palmyrens, the Batavians. Moments are re-enacted from the military history of these peoples as well as from the civil or religious life.</p>
<p>Currently, Terra Dacica Aeterna has about 70 members from all over the country. The official seat of the association is in Cluj Napoca, and one subsidiary have been established in Deva and another one will follow this year in Sibiu.</p>

Terra Dacica Aeterna aims at presenting ancient history on the present-territory of Romania. Our methods are unconventional, different from those employed in schools. We believe that history, the way it is taught in schools, is an incompletely adequate way of learning about the past. Thus, our association’s goal is to bring the general public closer to ancient history through experimental archaeology and reenactment. With the aid of experimental archaeology, the members of the association have recreated ancient equipment, tools, and buildings by using, as much as possible, the working methods and tools available during that period.

Through reenactment (an English word lacking an exact equivalent in Romania, the closest term being a synonym of “re-creation”), those objects are used, trying to discover as much data as possible on their functionality. Thus, both us and the public present at our shows, discover pieces of the puzzle that is the ancient history of the Dacians, Romans, and Sarmatians, in a way that stimulates the curiosity and desire to discovery that lies in each of us. 

History learnt from school can be thus completed through lived history. The experience we gained over these years has taught us that many of those present at our events became really interested in ancient history, an interest that history taught in school did not succeed in stirring.
Besides all these, just think about the children that come to events we are invited as well, able to see real-like battles in front of their eyes. They are totally mesmerized by our battles and most of the time, after the battle demonstration ends, we are besieged by them. We are offering them our weapons to feel in their tiny hands and our helmets to try on. There is no bigger joy than to see a child irradiating with happiness and amazement when he is geared with some of our battle equipment and weapons.


This is the difference your help will make. You help us to be able to reach more events and bring happiness in the hearts of more and more children and adults alike.
This is the first project of this kind we are doing and we really hope that your help will make a difference. A good one.


Spread the word, think with your heart and give culture and education a chance.

What we do:

Aid families who are faced with a financial hardship caused by, sudden, and severe medical illness of a family member.
All of our donated clothing, housewares, electronics, and furniture, are given back to people in the community who need them.

Work with at risk teens coming out of the juvenile system to provide jobs, training, mentoring, spiritual healing, guidance, and an opportunity to grow. 
Income tax and accounting services, financial counseling on better ways to budget and manage money.
Credit Enhancement services, and education on the credit system, how it works, why its important, and how to use it responsibly. 
Insurance services and consultation for families to help fill any gaps or liability they may have.
Job coaching and entrepreneurial mentoring.
Real estate and rental services, including education for families who need help with selling, buying, or renting a home, apartment or condominium.
Résumé assistance
Job placement assistance

What We Need & What You Get We are launching a program for the kids called ""Arts & Parts"" 
This program will be a mentored program to teach kids how things work and how to build things.  Kids will have an opportunity to take apart and build computers, and other household electronics.
We will also work with the kids to build things from wood, scrapbooking, and make clothing from fabric and patterns, and much much more.
    The Impact The program is designed to keep the kids engaged in activities that stimulate the mind, and allow them to see how things they use in everyday life are made and how they work.  It will allow them to be creative without having to worry about breaking something at home. 
Risks & Challenges
 The challenges we face are in the communities that we serve.  Kids end up sitting idle and without activities like these, they end up finding things to do that sometimes lead them down the wrong path.  We want to encourage their creativity and hopefully keep them off the streets.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>This project is the cumulative result of months of design thinking, hand-sewn prototyping, drafting and redrafting of patterns, surveying, and countless conversations to improve our products and amplify our mission. More than anything, we want to see this project through and empower you with the ability to be a model for the support of youth empowerment and fashion. We promise to do whatever it takes to make that possible!</div>
<div>
<br/>We believe integrity is the heart and soul of every successful company. Our integrity is defined by how we handle the risks and challenges we face. We will do everything it takes to make sure our customers are happy, not only with the products they receive, but with our service as well.</div>

<p></p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We've spent most of the last year working with our team and partners to mitigate as many risks as possible, however, we know there will still be hurdles along the way. We will always be transparent with our community about challenges, including these:</p>
<p><b>IN THE EVENT OF EPIC DEMAND</b></p>
<p>We have laid out contingency plans in the event of massive support from backers. We’ve confirmed that our manufacturing partners can take on additional units.</p>
<p><b>SUPPLIERS</b></p>
<p>While we do not foresee material supply to be a problem, we do acknowledge the unique set of challenges that arise when collecting raw material from multiple sources rather than ordering yardage from a factory. The most prominent challenge is the potential for delays, but we will try to mitigate this by making sure there is advance notice given to suppliers on the volume we expect from our campaign.</p>
<p><b>SHIPMENT</b></p>
<p>We're shipping our products through the mail. There is general risk in the reliability of shipping companies, but we'll make sure we keep track of your order at all times and communicate its progress openly to you.</p>

Maine energy-smart kids
can and do influence changes that help our environment.

The Maine Energy Education Program (MEEP)
needs your help now, to continue working with school aged children at their home, school or community venue. 
Funding levels have reached a critical low while we're (1) waiting for
grant funding support and (2) transitioning to fee based programming.  We
need your help during this transition.
With
your help we'll be able to continue
to
offer our Electricity & and Environment Classroom Workshops to schools
that request them while we’re transitioning to fee based programming.

These
are community-based renewable energy lessons from
which
kids learn how alternative energy is made and used and how it impacts our lives. 
They get charged up to take action to help ""green"" their
schools and homes by better managing energy choices.  Every family that
makes smarter energy choices helps reduce the impacts of pollution on
the environment.
MEEP reached over 75,000 kids in the
past 8 years and over 4,500 so far this year.  We
have a proven track record of success.
Why do we need your support now?
* We have been highly successful
for many years, but funding for education has dropped dramatically in Maine,
from both state and corporate grants for small non-profit curriculum-based
projects like ours.
* Until now, we've been offering
programming in schools at no charge, but the decline in resources is forcing us
to move to charging a fee for materials and staff time.
* Our Plan is to immediately establish a fund
to help schools transition through that change by initially offsetting some of
the new fee for schools that can't afford the full cost. Any grants we receive
will help us sustain that fund through the transition period.
Here's how your donations will be
used to implement the changes and sustain the program: You can help
us reach over 2,000 kids this fall
by contributing to our
transition fund. Donations will be used to help needy schools offset a portion
of the costs of sponsoring MEEP’s community-based renewable energy
lessons.

<p style=""text-align: justify;""> El corazón de este proyecto escolar es ofrecer
educación y un ambiente seguro para niños en situación de discapacidad física e
intelectual en un contexto donde prima la falta de acceso y mucho
desconocimiento de parte de la población en torno a la discapacidad. Estas
dificultades se suman a otras limitaciones que sufren los niños palestinos
producto de la ocupación militar, tales como restricciones en desplazamiento a
centros de salud y falta de oportunidades laborales para sus padres.  
School of Joy es un foco que permite entregar herramientas a los niños y
orientar a sus familias para lograr mayor inclusión. </p>

receives both boys and girls, however considering the conservative culture and
lack of awareness within certain parts of the community, girls with special

School of
Joy es una escuela para niños con discapacidad física e

escuela inicialmente con 5 profesores y que hoy cuenta con 11
profesores permanentes y estudiantes voluntarios de las universidades locales
que apoyan el trabajo. ¿Por qué necesitamos
tu ayuda?
School of Joy funciona en la casa de tres pisos donde se
instaló originalmente hace 20 años. En estos momentos aspiramos a renovar su
infraestructura con el fin de recibir más estudiantes y ofrecer espacios
adecuados para los estudiantes con discapacidades físicas e intelectuales. La
escuela tiene tres salas en desuso en el primer piso. Salas que si son
reparadas pueden evitarle a los niños el doloroso proceso de subir uno o dos
pisos por las escaleras para asistir a clases. Los espacios existen pero
requieren arduo trabajo para que puedan ser nuevamente utilizados.Los resultados del proyecto 
Acceso
     directo de los niños a las salas de clasesdesde
     la entrada del colegio, sin tener que subir las escaleras
     diariamente.  
Aumentar
     el número de estudiantes de la escuela, disminuyendo su lista de
     espera. 
Comenzar
     un programa pre-escolar para niños más pequeños, una sentida demanda de
     las familias.

¿Qué hace importante a esta escuela?

 El corazón de este proyecto escolar es ofrecer
educación y un ambiente seguro para niños en situación de discapacidad física e
intelectual en un contexto donde prima la falta de acceso y mucho
desconocimiento de parte de la población en torno a la discapacidad. Estas
dificultades se suman a otras limitaciones que sufren los niños palestinos
producto de la ocupación militar, tales como restricciones en desplazamiento a
centros de salud y falta de oportunidades laborales para sus padres.  
School of Joy es un foco que permite entregar herramientas a los niños y
orientar a sus familias para lograr mayor inclusión.

La
escuela actualmente acoge a 50 estudiantes entre las edades de 6 y 18 años. Los
estudiantes además de  educación formal reciben orientación vocacional y
se les enseñan técnicas de tallado en madera de olivo, uno de los oficios más
importantes en Belén, esto con el fin de facilitarles el ingreso al mundo
laboral y por ende alcanzar mayores niveles de autonomía. Estos niños y sus
familias hacen enormes esfuerzos para asistir al colegio, ya que provienen de
diferentes localidades de la provincia de Belén y otros pueblos cercanos en
Palestina. La mayoría de las familias carecen de recursos económicos y muchas
veces no cuentan con conocimientos suficiente para apoyar la integración de sus
hijos como miembros activos de la sociedad. 



¡Tú puedes apoyar este proyecto inclusivo!




¿Quiénes somos?
La Fundación Belén
2000 es una organización sin fines de lucro radicada en Chile que busca mejorar
la calidad de vida de los niños en Palestina, a través de ayuda solidaria. Los
fondos obtenidos nos permiten contribuir en forma permanente en tres ejes:
educación, salud y recreación. Hasta la fecha hemos entregado más de 4.800
becas, enviado 12 misiones médicas de diversas especialidades médicas hemos
aportado a la construcción de 9 parques recreacionales con ayuda de
la Fundación. 


A través de nuestra presencia y el
trabajo que realizamos en Palestina hemos podido evidenciar las necesidades de
la escuela! Si bien ellos reciben donaciones a nivel local y algunos
ingresos propios, estos no son suficientes y deben recurrir permanentemente a
benefactores y organizaciones internacionales para desarrollar su proyecto
escolar. La fundación quiere contribuir a su desarrollo permanente a través de
esta campaña y con un equipo de trabajo tanto en Chile como en Palestina, que
apoyará  la ejecución en terreno del proyecto.







Cuando alcancemos la meta propuesta (gracias a tu ayuda!!!) la campaña continuará abierta para quienes quieran seguir donando. Todo el dinero extra recaudado será destinado para restaurar el patio del colegio para que los niños puedan jugar en un espacio seguro, considerando la escasez de espacios seguros al aire libre en Palestina. 
Otras formas de ayudar
Si no puedes hacer una contribución monetaria existen otras formas de colaborar, ¡ayúdanos a difundir esta campaña!, compártenos en Facebook, twitea sobre nosotros, escribe un correo a tus familiares y amigos. Puedes usar las herramientas disponibles de Indiegogo.  Gracias!

This school for children with disabilities has been serving its   community for the past twenty years, and is now in need of our support!
School of Joy is a
small town school in the Bethlehem area that offers education and a safe
environment for poor children with physical and intellectual disabilities.
Founded by Mrs. Randa Abu Saada, who donated a house and recruited a staff of
five teachers. Now it has eleven teachers and several 

Why do we need your help?
School  of Joy still remains in the three level house originally donated over 20 years ago. It aspires to restore the infrastructure to be able to receive more children, and offer adequate facilities for their current physically and mentally challenged students. 
The school has three abandoned rooms on the ground floor. Rooms that can save the children from the pain to climb one or two floors  using stairs to go to class. The rooms already exist, but are in need a extensive of work to make them active and useful facilities.  

The results of the project 

Allow  first floor access to a facility
     directly connected to the entrance and            the outside yard. Without having to climb
     stairs daily.
Increase the capacity to receive more
     children to the school hence decreasing the number of students on the
     waiting list.
Start a small kindergarten for children with
     special needs. The school already received many requests from families but
     unfortunately does not have the capacity to admit them.








Why is this school
important?
 The heart of School
of Joy is to provide children a space where integration and acceptance is
possible taking into consideration that still there is lack of awareness about
their needs and abilities. In addition to the fact that these children
live under a military occupation that limits their freedom of movement to heath
facilities and restricts work opportunities for their parents.






The school currently takes
care of fifty one students, between the ages of six and eighteen years
old. At  School of Joy students receive vocational
 training and olive wood carving skills; one of the most important
crafts in Bethlehem, in an effort to help them become active in the working
world hence having higher opportunities of autonomy. These children
and their families make enormous efforts to attend school, students come from
all across the greater Bethlehem area and its surrounding villages in
Palestine. They come from poor backgrounds and their families often lack
the needed awareness to help them integrate as active members of society. It
receives both boys and girls, however considering the conservative culture and
lack of awareness within certain parts of the community, girls with special
needs are sometimes considered more of a shame that the family tends to hide,
rather than seek help. 
 A little bit of help goes a long way! We want to give these brave children the  tools to go through their challenges with more confidence!



Once we reach our goal (with your help!!!) we will keep the campaign open so you can still donate, the extra money raised will be used to renovate the outdoor yard  of the school, for the children to play outside considering  that Palestine has  very few safe playgrounds  for children to play in. 
Who are we?

The Bethlehem 2000
Foundation is a Chilean nonprofit NGO committed to provide Palestinian children
with education, health and recreational spaces. 
So far we have provided more that 4,800 scholarships, sent 12 medical missions
from diverse specialties and have contributed in building 9 recreational
parks.  Throughout our work and presence
on the field in Palestine, we have witnessed the additional help this school
needs! While they manage with local contributions and funding, they struggle
with reaching individuals and international societies that will help them
develop. The foundation has a team working 
both in Palestine and Chile to help follow up on the execution of the
project

<p>My beautiful boy was diagnosed with autism at age 2 ½ .<br/>Often appearing as if he’s not quite ‘of this world’, you’ll find him in the garden picking flowers and playing with dirt. His face is always covered with remnants of Nutella – firmly encrusted onto his cheeks with little grains of sand.<br/></p>
<p>So happy in his leafy space, it's easy to forget that he has developmental delays – minimal communication, a lack of social skills and dyspraxia. As his mommy, I worry about his future and need to help him understand people and the world around him so that he can protect himself.<br/></p>
<p>In going through the big learning curve of trying to understand and help my son, I have met the most wonderful people – parents, teachers, therapists – all of whom have helped me solve a little piece of our own autism puzzle.</p>

<p><strong>Along this bumpy ride – I have learnt many things, including:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Alexander has responded positively to children's apps and finds them far easier to relate to than real-life situations. Therefore apps are a great starting point for teaching abstract concepts to children.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>My hope is to teach our children how to engage and react to social situations - through repetitive learning and in their own time.<br/>If there is no pressure on them to perform initially, they will hopefully be more open to learning. The app is not a substitute for the real world, merely a starting point - i.e. role playing in preparation for the real thing.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">The Plan:</span>
</p>
<div>
<p>Up until now, I have funded the app project myself. However, as with all things tech- related, things like development and animation can be rather costly!</p>
<p>The app I refer to is actually a series of apps with different scenes mimicking real life eg. a playground, the shops and a children's birthday party etc.</p>
<p>I have already started with the 'playground' scene, but would also like have to another scene, specifically a 'children's birthday party' when I launch the app so that parents and educators have at least two scenes to start working with.</p>

</div></div>","Alexander's Story                                  
My beautiful boy was diagnosed with autism at age 2 ½ .Often appearing as if he’s not quite ‘of this world’, you’ll find him in the garden picking flowers and playing with dirt. His face is always covered with remnants of Nutella – firmly encrusted onto his cheeks with little grains of sand.
So happy in his leafy space, it's easy to forget that he has developmental delays – minimal communication, a lack of social skills and dyspraxia. As his mommy, I worry about his future and need to help him understand people and the world around him so that he can protect himself.
In going through the big learning curve of trying to understand and help my son, I have met the most wonderful people – parents, teachers, therapists – all of whom have helped me solve a little piece of our own autism puzzle.
My earlier career in IT inspired me to use my knowledge and expertise to start a business that would:


Help children understand social norms through technology.

Create a hugely successful business that would one day be able to employ my son in whatever capacity he is able.
Create a space where I could hire adults with autism - all of whom would bring their own unique set of skills.

This is how Strange Duck came about…



                                   
Along this bumpy ride – I have learnt many things, including:

Alexander has responded positively to children's apps and finds them far easier to relate to than real-life situations. Therefore apps are a great starting point for teaching abstract concepts to children.

My hope is to teach our children how to engage and react to social situations - through repetitive learning and in their own time.If there is no pressure on them to perform initially, they will hopefully be more open to learning. The app is not a substitute for the real world, merely a starting point - i.e. role playing in preparation for the real thing.

The Plan:


Up until now, I have funded the app project myself. However, as with all things tech- related, things like development and animation can be rather costly!
The app I refer to is actually a series of apps with different scenes mimicking real life eg. a playground, the shops and a children's birthday party etc.
I have already started with the 'playground' scene, but would also like have to another scene, specifically a 'children's birthday party' when I launch the app so that parents and educators have at least two scenes to start working with.



The 'Playground Scene':
Features of the app:


The child playing the app - the 'user' - will be encouraged to choose a friend.
Once the user has chosen a friend and a piece of equipment to play on, an animation of the two characters on the equipment will be played. This is fun to watch and further reinforces the joy of playing with a friend.
A bonus animation will play once the user and friend have played together to further reinforce the idea.

Rules - simple visual representations in the form of icons that show you what not to do on the equipment.            




What I'd like the child to learn:
Playing with a friend can be fun!

There is structure and order to playing with a friend, it's a skill that can be learned with practice.


Play equipment has rules which means that play is not the complete chaos a child with autism may perceive it to be.




The 'Children's Party Scene':
In this 'episode' of the series, my vision is to have the user be one of the characters attending a children's birthday party. He/she will learn about the social norms associated with such an event.What I'd like the child to learn:

What is expected of them when attending a birthday party, like handing over the gift and singing happy birthday while cutting the cake.

In this scene, I thought I would use the opportunity to let the user express how he/she is feeling as there is a lot of sensory stimuli at a gathering like this.Some children with autism might find it overwhelming from a sensory perspective.Icons depicting the various sensory issues will be displayed  - 'too loud', 'feeling shy', 'too many people' etc.I want to show the child that it's okay to feel overwhelmed - and that people will help them deal with it. 


There will be a group activity - hitting the pinata - which the app will help the user to play with the other children.

Where we are:

100% of graphic design for the playground scene is complete.

Some of the sound (voice, effects and music) has been recorded for the playground scene.        Voice, music and sound recorded by African Treehouse.                                                                       www.africantreehouse.com


Approximately 10% of the animation for the playground scene is complete.
0% of the code for the playground scene is complete.
The party scene is still in the design phase and needs full funding.


Where we need to be:



Finish sound, code and bonus animations for the playground scene.
Create the next 'scene' - a children's party. This will require additional graphic design, animations, voice recordings and code.
Launch Playground and Children's Party Scene in one app in Google Play Store and Apple App Store.


After investigating market-related prices and getting several quotes, I have learnt that it will cost $40,000 to complete and launch both app scenes, namely the playground and children's party scene.


Money, money, money!

Because my business, Strange Duck, also makes autism aids (flashcards and t-shirts) - I will use the money raised in this campaign to manufacture t-shirts and flashcards for my online store.

<p><b>ESCUELA DE KALASSA EN MALÍ</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>AIPC Pandora trabaja en Mali desde el año 2009 y, concretamente, en Kalassa
desde el 2011, cuando  un grupo de 10  voluntarios nuestros, se
comprometieron con nuestra social local, la asociación “Sourires des Femmes”, a construir una
escuela en la aldea de Kalassa, dónde una población de más de 10.000 personas
no tenía dónde educar a sus niños y niñas.</p>

<p> A su regreso, el grupo de voluntarios se constituyó
en comisión de participación y empezó una campaña de recaudación de fondos para
la construcción de la escuela. Complementariamente desde AIPC Pandora
obtuvimos financiación de las empresas <b>JC DECAUX y BNP PARIBAS</b>, además de
<b>muchos donantes privados</b>. En menos de 6 meses, en febrero 2012, se pudo
comenzar la construcción de la primera fase de la escuela primaria con dos
aulas, baños y despacho para el director, lo que permitió que 112 niños y niñas
pudieran empezar a estudiar en los cuatro cursos de primaria en turnos de
mañana y tarde. </p>
<p>Gracias
a las aportaciones de los <b>ayuntamientos de Torrelodones (Madrid) y
Castellbisbal (Barcelona)</b>, se puso en marcha, en el 2013,  la segunda fase con la construcción de dos
nuevas aulas, además se financió este año escolar. Con esta fase, otros 120
niños comenzaron la escuela secundaria. Además, con el apoyo de una segunda
comisión de voluntarios, se constituyó un grupo de costura, dónde se formó un
grupo de mujeres que a día de hoy cosen todos los uniformes de los niños y
niñas del colegio. </p>

<strong>SUMMER SELF-EMPOWERMENT CAMP BREAKDOWN</strong>
</div><div> </div><div>
<strong>WHO AM I?</strong>
</div><p>I am a retired educator living in Ontario, Canada .  I have a Doctorate<br/>in Education from the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (University of Toronto).  My special areas of expertise are in Curriculum, Teaching and Learning.</p><div>
I have taught at every level of the education system both in Canada and<br/>in Jamaica.  I<em>  </em>have emerged with one basic philosophy about students and learning and that is, that every child can learn regardless of their economic and social<br/>background, given the proper tools to do so.  </div><p>Learning is not reserved for the rich.  Grasping higher level thinking skills is not only for the rich.  It is for everyone, given the opportunity to do so.  But I have also realized that money and parents' financial status can influence a child's academic performance.  However, with your help and the help of the wider community we can make a difference in boosting a child's intellectual capacity.  We can change the trajectory of their lives by engaging them in critical thinking activities.</p><div>
<strong>THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX</strong>
</div><p><br/>I have challenged myself to defend the poor and the disenfranchised in<br/>poor regions of Jamaica to help them get rid of 'stinking thinking'<br/>(Zig Ziglar) and empower themselves to live more productive lives. <br/>Disenfranchised young people can achieve their dreams by thinking<br/>outside the box handed to them and be a part of the change they want<br/>to see in the world (Mahatma Gandhi).</p><p> <strong>ENCOURAGE THEM  TO BE LIFE LONG LEARNERS</strong></p><strong><p> </p></strong><p><b>EMPOWER THESE YOUNG ONES.  PLEASE SELECT A PERK AND DONATE </b></p><div>

<p><strong>STUDENTS AT THE LEADERSHIP TRAINING CAMP (2012)</strong><br/><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>THE TEAM</strong></p>
<p>A team of Servant Leaders have been travelling around the island of Jamaica each summer (on a limited budget).  The team teaches kids strategies to help them address some of the larger issues that face them on a daily basis.  </p>
<p><strong>WHAT IS OUR GOAL?</strong></p>
<p>TEACH YOUNGSTERS HOW TO FISH<br/><br/>Our goal is to equip these children with skills that can empower them<br/>to rise above their circumstances and better their lives.  Most of us<br/>are acquainted with the expression, 'Give a man a fish and you feed<br/>him for a day, teach a man to fish and you feed him for a life<br/>time.'  The origins of this powerful Chinese proverb  has been<br/>attributed to various people but the meaning surpasses even the<br/>author who wrote this famous quote.  </p>
<p>We want to make it real for these young people.  We want to show them that begging, stealing and anything unethical that they may have turned to in the pastwill get them nowhere and can only lead them to a life of despair and regret.<br/></p>
<p><strong>SELF- EMPOWERMENT</strong></p>
<strong></strong><p><strong></strong> The goal of training young people in these qualities is to empower them<br/>to see that they are worth way beyond what we can physically give them. <br/>We want them to learn to be independent from an early age.  We want<br/>to train them to think outside the box of poverty, social instability<br/>and chaos.  We believe that they can take the skills they have been<br/>taught to change the trajectory of their lives and never looking behind.</p>
<p><b>LEADERSHIP TRAINING</b></p>
<p>We want to help them become leaders in their community at various levels,<br/>whether it is at home, school, church or the wider community. <br/>Through the camps that we have been conducting, a major thread that<br/>we have recognized is the deficit in conflict resolution skills among<br/>a vast majority of young people.  We are helping them change that<br/>attitude.  Open your pocket books and help us fight valiantly for<br/>these young ones.  You only go around ONCE.</p>

<p>Being a geographically isolated and tiny town (pop. about 1000), opportunities come hard for young people in Cabot. Funds are sparse and connections are tricky. This spring, a group of community bike enthusiasts and the school principal launched a challenge - during the final week of school, encourage 12 students to plan and execute a bike trip from the Canadian border to the southern edge of Vermont.

</div></div>","Getting out in the world.   Cabot, Vermont can be a great place to grow up. Nestled in Vermont's Green Mountains, it's a veritable paradise of farms, forests and beautiful views. 
It can also be a tough place to get away from. 
Being a geographically isolated and tiny town (pop. about 1000), opportunities come hard for young people in Cabot. Funds are sparse and connections are tricky. This spring, a group of community bike enthusiasts and the school principal launched a challenge - during the final week of school, encourage 12 students to plan and execute a bike trip from the Canadian border to the southern edge of Vermont. Along the way, students would meet Vermont educational proficiencies focusing on local history, physical fitness, leadership and resilience.    Doesn't take much.  We've already started building the trip from the ground up.

<p><i><b>In the beginning ….</b></i></p>
<p>It all
started as a small project in the Pousada dos Duendes guesthouse in 2003 where
we helped 6 local children with their basic education and homework. Over the
next few years it became so popular that it was no longer viable in the
guesthouse.  In 2008 we launched our first fundraising campaign to buy and
dedicate a house to the project to increase the number of children we could
accommodate, and so the <b>Casa Grande Association</b> was set in motion. Since
then we have grown beyond expectation with over 300 children having benefited
from the project. Through further donations we have been able to renovate the
house and make some much needed structural improvements; we built a bathroom
for the children and separated the living area from the classroom. The space
currently serves about sixty children. We have no fixed financial support and therefore
rely solely on donations.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458051933/zo9fxienopicqk6rjgzm.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 613.01px;height: 407px;""/></p><p></p>
<p><i><b>Some
geographical context....</b></i></p>
<p>Lencois lies
in inland North-Eastern Brazil, on the edge of the Chapada Diamantina National
Park.  Historically this is a diamond
mining area with huge economic booms and slumps which finally came to an abrupt
end in the early 1990s with the prohibition of mining.  The formation of the National Park and the ensuing
surge of eco-tourism have given the area a new economic industry but the
community was,  and still is, unprepared for the drastic changes to the local economy
and the opportunities available.  </p>
<p>At Casa
Grande we look to reduce this impact by strengthening the education of children
and adolescents by promoting awareness and respect for the environment.
Training workshops enable new opportunities for employment (and therefore income)
to a region affected by unemployment and low level of formal education after
the mining period.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xaf1/v/t1.0-9/166103_479013258460_4733748_n.jpg?oh=7859f3c21295ba927983054aea238063&amp;oe=578A901F&amp;__gda__=1464644065_b0d9afd7adf5ed2d46a2a8d0b28fd85c"" src="""" style=""width: 582px;height: 437px;""/><br/></p>
<p><i><b>Introducing the children....</b></i></p>
<p>The aim
of Casa Grande is to give local children a place where they can play and learn
in a secure environment and to offer them activities and resources to which
they would not otherwise have access. The children who attend Casa Grande
reside in the Alto da Estrela neighbourhood, an area of low income in which
many families depend on government aid. 
Many children drop out of school and most barely complete the first
grade. The general age range of the children is from 4 to 14, the majority of
whom are very behind in their studies due to lack of support and incentive at
home; most of them do not have toys or books in their homes. Casa Grande aims
to alleviate this deficiency, in the hope that more children remain in school. </p>
<p>Many of
the children come from homes that are emotionally unstable and from as young as
6 years old they are left to spend most of their time unsupervised on the
streets.  It is not unusual to find an
8-year-old looking after a 2-year-old sibling. 
There are high levels of domestic violence, drinking and drug use in the
home which breeds very low self-esteem and blocks their notion of what is right
and wrong. As a result, it is easy for them to be enticed into drugs and
prostitution; there is a lot of unwanted teenage pregnancy and girls as young
as 13 become mothers. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458052177/kyuyyr3ymlqqdffjcln0.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i><b>Entertaining the children....</b></i></p>
<p>At Casa
Grande we aim to find activities and workshops that promote general learning,
teach new skills and entertain the children. 
We look to give children the opportunity to express themselves and be
heard through storytelling. We promote politeness, respect for others and
general hygiene; every day when they children arrive, they brush their teeth
with their own labelled toothbrushes kept in the house. By allowing the
children the opportunity to play in a controlled environment, they can enjoy
their free time in a constructive way which helps them to grow emotionally and
increase self-esteem, whilst teaching them to share and how to interact with
other children without fighting. We also help the children with their homework
which demonstrates to them the importance of a formal education, encourages
them to stay in school and improves their chances of employment in the future. Through
the monitoring, guidance and social-family support which we offer, the Casa Grande Association has developed a greater understanding of the needs of
children who participate in our activities.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458052293/jznkcsfc9y5apdcvmc5v.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We
endeavour to develop activities that promote respect for the artistic and
historical values ​​of the social context of the community through music and
dance workshops, visits to museums and libraries and <i>capoeira</i> classes. We also teach basic computer skills, offer
foreign language classes and exhibit children's films. At Casa Grande, we
encourage the children to learn about their neighbourhood, and have just
started a project in which we clean the streets of <i>Alto da Estrela</i>. The children then draw the street onto a map of
the neighbourhood and vote to choose the name of this street. By cleaning the
streets, the children become more conscientious about dropping litter and the
environment, which is of paramount importance in a National Park as beautiful
(and clean) as the Chapada Diamantina. This also strengthens the community and
promotes citizenship, collective work and the care of public property, whilst
also endearing the volunteers to the locals.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458052456/sf72aidezvjtqqjvs2qk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>

<p><b><i>Introducing the staff....</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The daily
activities are run by volunteers who are generally foreign university students
studying Portuguese. They spend between three and six months living and
breathing the project, and most importantly integrating with the local
community through capoeira classes
and interaction with the children. This promotes tolerance and openness to
cultural, racial and linguistic differences and invites a healthier living
dialogue between people from different walks of life. In the new economy of
international tourism this is essential for the local community. </p>
<p>In 2015,
Casa Grande was awarded a government grant that enabled us to contract one full
time member of staff to coordinate the Casa Grande and funded a program of very
popular workshops.  This coordinator,
Rosa, is responsible for the daily life of the Association, the upkeep of the
classroom and volunteer accommodation. She also organises events and coordinates the volunteers during their stay. During this year we
have seen huge improvements in the day-to-day organisation of Casa Grande and
we have realised the extreme importance of a coordinator to the future of the project.</p>
<p>Rosa has
been involved in the Casa Grande since its birth; she was one of the founding
members of the association and worked as a volunteer before the official
formation of the project. Rosa is a qualified teacher from a local family so,
as well as having many years of teaching experience, she is well known and
respected in Alto da Estrela, which
helps to integrate Casa Grande into the community. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458052875/jfachcmuivatuhofx3iv.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 276.936px;height: 415px;""/></p>
<p><i><b>Let’s talk about money....</b></i></p>
<p>Unfortunately,
the funding for coordinator’s salary and the workshops has now come to an end. We
hope to use this fundraising campaign to continue to reap the benefits of
having a permanent member of staff, to buy essential equipment for our
activities and to continue the workshops which are so gratefully accepted by
the community.  Despite being the most
important cog in the Casa Grande machine and a qualified teacher, Rosa is
prepared to continue to work for the minimum wage, which is well below the kind of
salary someone with her qualifications would expect to earn on the open
market. To put this in context, the minimum wage in Brazil is 880 Reais a month, which is the equivalent to
about 150GBP or 220USD.</p>
<p>Donations
from the international volunteers pay for the daily maintenance of the Casa
Grande, for example the water, electricity and basic material for activities.
We seek donations from visitors to the region in addition to funding from
private companies and government departments. We also uphold a calendar of events
for fundraising, however this is very time consuming and does not guarantee
sufficient income to support and sustain the workshops and the coordinator’s
salary.</p><p>
</p><p><b><i>Fundraising Goals</i></b></p>
<p><i>Our overall target is </i><b><i>£14,795 </i></b><i>to be distributed in the following three stages:</i></p>
<p><b>Stage I:</b></p><p><b>£2,845 </b>will be used for the purchase of <b>necessary</b> <b>classroom</b> and <b>office</b> <b>equipment</b> and <b>electronics </b></p>
<p>We are in need of new
tables and chairs for the classroom, a projector for films and presentations and
a printer and filing cabinet for the administration of Casa Grande. We will
also purchase 4 laptops so the children can learn computer skills and the older
children can do their homework and research within the Casa Grande. In today's world the basic use of
computers is  becoming increasingly essential in the work place.</p>

<p><b>£350 </b>will be
used for a <b>trampoline</b></p>
<p>We would like to buy
a trampoline, not only for the children of <i>Alto
da Estrela, </i>but for all the children of Lencois. Though this might seem
frivolous and extravagant, this would provide entertainment for the children
and act as a tool for fundraising. Currently, on public holidays, a trampoline
is brought into the centre of Lencois and charges 3Reais for 10 minutes. If we
could take the trampoline to other areas, we would be able to continue our
fundraising regularly in the town when this campaign has finished. A permanent
source of fundraising for Casa Grande would be huge for the sustenance and
development of the project.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>£1,800 </b>will be
used for <b>Coordinator’s salary</b> </p>
<p>We cannot stress enough how important a permanent
member of staff is to the project. Everything runs more smoothly with Rosa
working and we want to be able to pay her at least the minimum wage for all her
hard work. She will continue arranging all the activities listed above and
organising more fundraising activities. She also offers essential support and guidance to the volunteers whilst helping with house maintenance and planning; this ensures that they can realise their full potential.</p>

<p><b><b>Stage II:</b><br/></b></p><p>If we manage to complete our fundraising for Stage I,<b> £5,000</b> will be used to <b>develop a plot of land</b> next to the Casa
Grande which was donated to the project.</p>
<p>This area is
overgrown and on a large angle. It is used as a dumping ground for rubbish
and a hangout for drug users. The plot will be cleared and a containing wall
will be constructed to level the land. We will then build a wall to isolate it
from the street and build an outdoor play area for recreational activities,
games and sports so that we can extend Casa Grande activities outside of the
classroom.</p><p></p><p><b>Stage III:  If we manage to surpass our original target all further funds will go towards the following project:</b><br/></p>
<p>We have long term plans to<b> build a new teaching and presentation
area</b> on the Casa Grande plot.</p>
<p>We are looking to
extend the Casa Grande teaching areas by building a new area on the plot of
land. This will serve for workshops and presentations so that we have room to
accommodate more children from the local area and offer more activities. We

In the beginning ….
It all
started as a small project in the Pousada dos Duendes guesthouse in 2003 where
we helped 6 local children with their basic education and homework. Over the
next few years it became so popular that it was no longer viable in the
guesthouse.  In 2008 we launched our first fundraising campaign to buy and
dedicate a house to the project to increase the number of children we could
accommodate, and so the Casa Grande Association was set in motion. Since
then we have grown beyond expectation with over 300 children having benefited
from the project. Through further donations we have been able to renovate the
house and make some much needed structural improvements; we built a bathroom
for the children and separated the living area from the classroom. The space
currently serves about sixty children. We have no fixed financial support and therefore
rely solely on donations.
Some
geographical context....
Lencois lies
in inland North-Eastern Brazil, on the edge of the Chapada Diamantina National
Park.  Historically this is a diamond
mining area with huge economic booms and slumps which finally came to an abrupt
end in the early 1990s with the prohibition of mining.  The formation of the National Park and the ensuing
surge of eco-tourism have given the area a new economic industry but the
community was,  and still is, unprepared for the drastic changes to the local economy
and the opportunities available.  
At Casa
Grande we look to reduce this impact by strengthening the education of children
and adolescents by promoting awareness and respect for the environment.
Training workshops enable new opportunities for employment (and therefore income)
to a region affected by unemployment and low level of formal education after
the mining period.
Introducing the children....
The aim
of Casa Grande is to give local children a place where they can play and learn
in a secure environment and to offer them activities and resources to which
they would not otherwise have access. The children who attend Casa Grande
reside in the Alto da Estrela neighbourhood, an area of low income in which
many families depend on government aid. 
Many children drop out of school and most barely complete the first
grade. The general age range of the children is from 4 to 14, the majority of
whom are very behind in their studies due to lack of support and incentive at
home; most of them do not have toys or books in their homes. Casa Grande aims
to alleviate this deficiency, in the hope that more children remain in school. 
Many of
the children come from homes that are emotionally unstable and from as young as
6 years old they are left to spend most of their time unsupervised on the
streets.  It is not unusual to find an
8-year-old looking after a 2-year-old sibling. 
There are high levels of domestic violence, drinking and drug use in the
home which breeds very low self-esteem and blocks their notion of what is right
and wrong. As a result, it is easy for them to be enticed into drugs and
prostitution; there is a lot of unwanted teenage pregnancy and girls as young
as 13 become mothers. 
Entertaining the children....
At Casa
Grande we aim to find activities and workshops that promote general learning,
teach new skills and entertain the children. 
We look to give children the opportunity to express themselves and be
heard through storytelling. We promote politeness, respect for others and
general hygiene; every day when they children arrive, they brush their teeth
with their own labelled toothbrushes kept in the house. By allowing the
children the opportunity to play in a controlled environment, they can enjoy
their free time in a constructive way which helps them to grow emotionally and
increase self-esteem, whilst teaching them to share and how to interact with
other children without fighting. We also help the children with their homework
which demonstrates to them the importance of a formal education, encourages
them to stay in school and improves their chances of employment in the future. Through
the monitoring, guidance and social-family support which we offer, the Casa Grande Association has developed a greater understanding of the needs of
children who participate in our activities.
We
endeavour to develop activities that promote respect for the artistic and
historical values ​​of the social context of the community through music and
dance workshops, visits to museums and libraries and capoeira classes. We also teach basic computer skills, offer
foreign language classes and exhibit children's films. At Casa Grande, we
encourage the children to learn about their neighbourhood, and have just
started a project in which we clean the streets of Alto da Estrela. The children then draw the street onto a map of
the neighbourhood and vote to choose the name of this street. By cleaning the
streets, the children become more conscientious about dropping litter and the
environment, which is of paramount importance in a National Park as beautiful
(and clean) as the Chapada Diamantina. This also strengthens the community and
promotes citizenship, collective work and the care of public property, whilst
also endearing the volunteers to the locals.

Introducing the staff....
The daily
activities are run by volunteers who are generally foreign university students
studying Portuguese. They spend between three and six months living and
breathing the project, and most importantly integrating with the local
community through capoeira classes
and interaction with the children. This promotes tolerance and openness to
cultural, racial and linguistic differences and invites a healthier living
dialogue between people from different walks of life. In the new economy of
international tourism this is essential for the local community. 
In 2015,
Casa Grande was awarded a government grant that enabled us to contract one full
time member of staff to coordinate the Casa Grande and funded a program of very
popular workshops.  This coordinator,
Rosa, is responsible for the daily life of the Association, the upkeep of the
classroom and volunteer accommodation. She also organises events and coordinates the volunteers during their stay. During this year we
have seen huge improvements in the day-to-day organisation of Casa Grande and
we have realised the extreme importance of a coordinator to the future of the project.
Rosa has
been involved in the Casa Grande since its birth; she was one of the founding
members of the association and worked as a volunteer before the official
formation of the project. Rosa is a qualified teacher from a local family so,
as well as having many years of teaching experience, she is well known and
respected in Alto da Estrela, which
helps to integrate Casa Grande into the community. 
Let’s talk about money....
Unfortunately,
the funding for coordinator’s salary and the workshops has now come to an end. We
hope to use this fundraising campaign to continue to reap the benefits of
having a permanent member of staff, to buy essential equipment for our
activities and to continue the workshops which are so gratefully accepted by
the community.  Despite being the most
important cog in the Casa Grande machine and a qualified teacher, Rosa is
prepared to continue to work for the minimum wage, which is well below the kind of
salary someone with her qualifications would expect to earn on the open
market. To put this in context, the minimum wage in Brazil is 880 Reais a month, which is the equivalent to
about 150GBP or 220USD.
Donations
from the international volunteers pay for the daily maintenance of the Casa
Grande, for example the water, electricity and basic material for activities.
We seek donations from visitors to the region in addition to funding from
private companies and government departments. We also uphold a calendar of events
for fundraising, however this is very time consuming and does not guarantee
sufficient income to support and sustain the workshops and the coordinator’s
salary.
Fundraising Goals
Our overall target is £14,795 to be distributed in the following three stages:
Stage I:£2,845 will be used for the purchase of necessary classroom and office equipment and electronics 
We are in need of new
tables and chairs for the classroom, a projector for films and presentations and
a printer and filing cabinet for the administration of Casa Grande. We will
also purchase 4 laptops so the children can learn computer skills and the older
children can do their homework and research within the Casa Grande. In today's world the basic use of
computers is  becoming increasingly essential in the work place.
· 
4
Tables    @ £35  = £140
· 
24
Chairs    @ £5  = £120
· 
2
White boards    @ £35  = £70
· 
3
Water Filters    @ £15  = £45
· 
4 
Laptops    @ £300   = £1200
· 
1
Camera    @ £120  = £120
· 
1
Projector    @ £400  = £400
· 
1
Speaker    @ £150  = £150
· 
1
Laser Printer    @ £200  = £200
· 
1
Filing Cabinet   @ £150   = £150·  50 Children's Books  @ £5 = £250
£350 will be
used for a trampoline
We would like to buy
a trampoline, not only for the children of Alto
da Estrela, but for all the children of Lencois. Though this might seem
frivolous and extravagant, this would provide entertainment for the children
and act as a tool for fundraising. Currently, on public holidays, a trampoline
is brought into the centre of Lencois and charges 3Reais for 10 minutes. If we
could take the trampoline to other areas, we would be able to continue our
fundraising regularly in the town when this campaign has finished. A permanent
source of fundraising for Casa Grande would be huge for the sustenance and
development of the project.

£1,800 will be
used for Coordinator’s salary 
We cannot stress enough how important a permanent
member of staff is to the project. Everything runs more smoothly with Rosa
working and we want to be able to pay her at least the minimum wage for all her
hard work. She will continue arranging all the activities listed above and
organising more fundraising activities. She also offers essential support and guidance to the volunteers whilst helping with house maintenance and planning; this ensures that they can realise their full potential.
· 
12 Months   @150
  = £1800
£4,800 will be
used for workshops (twice weekly) 
After their
aforementioned success in previous years we aim to continue with the following
workshops. These include the introduction of a new street dance workshop with
the hope of involving older children.
· 
8 months – African Dance                @£120   =
£960
· 
8 months – Percussion                      @£120   =
£960
· 
8 months – Street
Dance                  @£120   =
£960
· 
8 months – Toys from Recycling    @£120   = £960  ·  8 months – Basic Computer Skills @£120   = £960 
Stage II:If we manage to complete our fundraising for Stage I, £5,000 will be used to develop a plot of land next to the Casa
Grande which was donated to the project.
This area is
overgrown and on a large angle. It is used as a dumping ground for rubbish
and a hangout for drug users. The plot will be cleared and a containing wall
will be constructed to level the land. We will then build a wall to isolate it
from the street and build an outdoor play area for recreational activities,
games and sports so that we can extend Casa Grande activities outside of the
classroom.Stage III:  If we manage to surpass our original target all further funds will go towards the following project:
We have long term plans to build a new teaching and presentation
area on the Casa Grande plot.
We are looking to
extend the Casa Grande teaching areas by building a new area on the plot of
land. This will serve for workshops and presentations so that we have room to
accommodate more children from the local area and offer more activities. We
also want to build a small area to be a crèche for the younger siblings of the children
that come to Casa Grande and a new kitchen so that we will be able to serve
food to the children who often have nutritional deficiency.  One of the past volunteers has now qualified
as an architect and has drawn up plans for this area.

She has a Masters degree in teaching, five full length albums of original songs and has toured the globe as a solo singer songwriter. For the last decade she has worked as an educator in a variety of learning communities from Tibetan monasteries in India, to private alternative schools, to at risk populations in public schools. She has now combined her passions and expertise into one career by developing <a href=""www.holisticartventures.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Young Songwriter Programs </a>which coach kids in expressing themselves creatively through songwriting. During the workshops and camps, kids are exposed to a variety of activities including theater games, journaling, collaging, nature walks and urban explorations in order to collect ideas for lyrics and song topics. As inspiration builds, the songwriting process occurs both collectively and independently while mentors make themselves available as needed. All songs are recorded on a basic, high quality recording unit with kids being involved as much as their interest dictates.  Each participant is given a recording of all of the songs in the form of a CD which they design and decorate cover art for. </p>

<p>The response to these programs has been profound with parents and kids alike using words such as ""transformative"" and ""unbelievably fun and creative"" to describe their experience.

<p>Our mission has always been to offer our work to as many people as possible. That's why we do a free outdoor show every year, and that's why we are asking for your help now. </p>
<p>With your help, more students from more walks of life will be able to study this unique theatrical form of cultural heritage.  </p>
<p>The more we raise, the more we can offer to students. This scholarship will help defray the costs of flights, trains, food, and tuition.  </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Ombelico Mask Academy is a joint venture with West Chester University. WCU has already agreed to offer $10,000 in scholarships for this program. We at Ombelico want to match (and maybe exceed!) their offer to help get this program off the ground in its inaugural year. </p>
<p>With tuition, flights, trains, and food , the total cost to attend the Academy is approximately $6,500 per student.  If we reach our goal of $10,000 we will offer 5 students scholarships of $2,000 each. If we raise more, we can offer more! </p>
<p>We have some exciting perks too! From surprise thank you emails and long-winded monikers to Ombelico swag and a custom leather mask, we have something for everyone to say, ""Thanks for helping students study this cultural treasure and have a transformative life experience!"" </p>
<p>If everyone who reads this gave just $10, we would reach our goal. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">And, if we don't reach our goal, whatever money we raise will still go towards defraying costs for students!</span></p>

<p>We've been making free, accessible, family-friendly, outdoor comic theatre for almost 10 years now. Ombelico Mask Academy is the next level of growth for us.

<p>My name is Kathleen Desrosiers, for more
than 20 years I have been working in the animal field as an veterinary technician as well as a consultant in canine behaviour.</p>
<p>Each year, too many animals are abandoned
because of behaviour problems or aggression. In 2008, I founded the Aïkiou
Company whose goal is to invent and produce innovative products which help
prevent eating problems and boredom with household pets.</p>
<p>After many years, my husband Alexandre joined
me at the head of the company in order to continue our mission which is to
provide stimulating activities for household pets in order to fulfill their
natural needs to reduce the number of abandoned animals.</p>
<p>While Alexandre assumed the head of the
company, I decided to go for my dream which was to write a children’s book
about how to better understand the language of dogs.</p>
<p>Like a lot of families we have animals and
we were looking for educational tools to help our daughters learn how to be
safer around our dogs.</p>
<p>Keeping in mind that most dog bites are
caused by the family dog, we needed a tool to help our children learn to
identify the different signals dogs use to communicate with us.</p>
<p>We decided to create our first story book
which facilitates teaching in a playful way how to behave around dogs and
therefore prevent bites.</p>
<p>That is how Fondation Humanimo was born in
2014 with an educational mission towards children and their families. We invite
you to share this book with your children and the people around you to help us
attain our goal.</p>
<p>Together we will succeed to reduce the risk
of animal bites and abandonment.</p>
<p>A very big thank you to all of you for your
help!</p>

than 20 years I have been working in the animal field as an veterinary technician as well as a consultant in canine behaviour.
Each year, too many animals are abandoned
because of behaviour problems or aggression. In 2008, I founded the Aïkiou
Company whose goal is to invent and produce innovative products which help
prevent eating problems and boredom with household pets.
After many years, my husband Alexandre joined
me at the head of the company in order to continue our mission which is to
provide stimulating activities for household pets in order to fulfill their
natural needs to reduce the number of abandoned animals.
While Alexandre assumed the head of the
company, I decided to go for my dream which was to write a children’s book
about how to better understand the language of dogs.
Like a lot of families we have animals and
we were looking for educational tools to help our daughters learn how to be
safer around our dogs.
Keeping in mind that most dog bites are
caused by the family dog, we needed a tool to help our children learn to
identify the different signals dogs use to communicate with us.
We decided to create our first story book
which facilitates teaching in a playful way how to behave around dogs and
therefore prevent bites.
That is how Fondation Humanimo was born in
2014 with an educational mission towards children and their families. We invite
you to share this book with your children and the people around you to help us
attain our goal.
Together we will succeed to reduce the risk
of animal bites and abandonment.
A very big thank you to all of you for your
help!
Humanimo Foundation is a non-profit organization with a mission to promote a healthy relationship between humans and animals while sensitizing children to the animals’ needs; this would permit the establishment of safety prevention strategies. With our multidisciplinary team, we wish to promote the knowledge and awareness of animal language and behaviour through the creation of this book, the educational materials and workshops for youths, all through real and professional information. We also want to extoll the virtues of zootherapy as well as children interaction activities with animals.",11.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<i>""Most people do not listen with the intent to understand; they listen with the intent to reply.” - Stephen R. Covey</i><br/><br/>From an early age I have been passionate about developing the skills to help others resolve conflict. Initially this was through the teachings of a martial art that focuses more on understanding the psychology of conflict, than just the physical aspect. Over the past 25 years I have evolved this art way beyond the boundaries of physical conflict to where it is today. I believe that through the teachings of understanding perception and effective communication styles, most day-to-day conflicts can be resolved peacefully.<br/><br/><p>Being so passionate and experienced at resolving conflict, I now want to spread this knowledge to helping others to become more confident in themselves. My goal is to help others resolve conflicts within them selves, personal relationships, bringing harmony to the workplace and also supporting schools with a variety of anti-bullying and self-esteem programs.</p>
<p>By supporting this campaign you will help to bring essential life skills to many people and help to build understanding and confidence in others; because ""Confidence is Beautiful!""<br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>By supporting this campaign it demonstrates how passionate you also feel about helping others to resolve conflict. Your funding will allow for the programs already started to become reality and the birth of others.</p>
<p>The funding will specifically go to these areas:<br/>• Development and implementation of various Conflict Resolution Workshops<br/>• Financial support to offering anti-bullying programs to schools<br/>• Youth programs for teenagers to understand and develop inner beauty<br/>• Low-Income community programs to encourage young adults to inspire others<br/>• Assisting children with challenging behaviours<br/></p>
<p>What do you get out of donating to this campaign?<br/>• Should you choose; you could be listed on handout materials helping to promote yourself or business.<br/>• You get to become part of a bigger picture towards helping others to resolve conflict.<br/>• Various perks based upon campaign contribution (See perks!)<br/></p>
<p>Our goal is to reach the $10,000 at this time. This will provide the valuable resources and programs needed to reach those that cannot afford them. Even if you are unable to financially contribute but are able to assist in making important connections, you have our deepest appreciations.<br/></p>
<p>We are committed to ""Inspiring Other to Resolve Conflict"".<br/>
</p>
<ul></ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The impact you can make by donating to this campaign is huge. As we know bullying remains in our schools. Children have to deal with confidence issues on a daily bases. Sure! There is much support available through help lines etc. but the true impact comes from what youth do on a daily bases in the school environment. The same applies to teenage girls for example. They are constantly trying to fit in to societies standards while managing their own personal development. The peer pressure to be slim, to wear certain clothing or to simply ""fit in"" is unbearable at times. Add the forever changing hormonal aspects and you start to develop a much bigger picture. Educating teenage girls on how boys perceive them and that ""True self confidence comes from with and not from what others make think say or do"", could make a huge difference in their lives. Can you imagine being in a position where you are able to help just one person to feel beautiful?</p>
<p>I can assure you ""It feels incredible!""<br/></p>
<p>Our goal is to provide people with the understanding and skills to resolve conflict. To inspire them to become great role models; not only to others but more importantly to themselves.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> Our biggest challenge has been cutting through the red tape in attempting to get into schools. This is mainly due to funding. We simply don't have the funding to support the programs we have developed and taught on a smaller scale.</p>
<p>As we know the public school system specifically is low on funding and cannot afford specialized programs. They therefore rely on many free hand outs inclusive of motivational talks. As great as these talks are at the time; as much as they inspire at the time; children forget most of it the second they step out of the door and back into the reality of their daily routine.</p>
<p>With your donations we can start to realistically approach the schools knowing that one of the biggest hurdles has been removed. The same applies to low-income communities that also rely on hand outs. Our passion and commitment to making things happen is unwavering and I'm hoping you will join the cause.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>We fully appreciate and can relate to the fact that there are many that simply cannot afford to contribute. When you know you have programs that can make a big impact in the lives of others, there is nothing more frustrating than knowing you can't afford to do it.</p>
<p>So how can you help in other ways?</p> <ul> <li>Spread the word of our conflict resolution workshops in any way you can!</li>
<li>Help connect us with those that may be willing to contribute.</li>
<li>Help connect us with corporate entities that could benefit from our workshops.<br/>
</li>
<li>The greater success we get with these, the more funding becomes available to run the lesser funded programs.</li>
</ul>
<p>In anticipation of your support, I would like to say Thank You!<br/></p>

<div>Automation, artificial intelligence (AI), and robotics are increasingly common factors in each of our lives. We may not realize it, but we encounter this technology in some way almost every day.</div>
<p>These technological revolutions have made our lives more efficient and productive. There is a consequence that has developed from them as well: the elimination of jobs.</p>
<p>As work becomes more redundant, our professional activities become increasingly unnecessary.</p>
<p>AI has the ability to perform simple tasks faster and cheaper than humans. In time, we will see more than chatbots and automated customer service. Robotics and automation could replace physicians, engineers, attorneys, and manufacturing professionals in the near future.</p>
<p><strong>This is the problem we face.</strong></p>
<p>Thankfully, there is a solution available that is accessible to all of us. Aatos by Nexeraa will empower future generations to take advantage of the technological evolution of AI.</p>

<p><strong>Why We Must Face the Threat of AI Right Now</strong></p>
<p>AI automation <a href=""https://www.experfy.com/blog/how-on-earth-will-artificial-intelligence-add-16-trillion-dollars-to-the-world-s-economy-by-2030"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">could create $14 trillion in disruptive impacts</a> within the manufacturing sector. Some of these impacts, such as lower wages, fewer jobs, and efficiency gains, are already being experienced.</p>
<p>These are benefits that help the corporation instead of the worker.</p>
<p>Famed scientist Stephen Hawking told the BBC in 2014 and in 2017 that the rise of AI would be “either the best or the worst thing ever to happen to humanity – we do not yet know which.”</p>
<p>AI has the potential to eradicate disease. It can eliminate poverty.</p>
<p><strong>It could also lead to full-scale unemployment.</strong></p>
<p>In a worst-case scenario, autonomous systems <a href=""https://autonomousweapons.org/article-36-reviews-and-addressing-lethal-autonomous-weapons-systems/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">could even view humanity as a threat</a> and work to remove us from our planet.</p>
<p>We believe that a positive future, full of potential, is within our reach.</p>
<p>Nexeraa is a socially-conscious software company that acknowledges there are challenges with AI on the horizon. We also know that when it is used to benefit humanity, AI can be a life-changing solution.</p>
<p>We can empower ourselves to create a brighter future.</p>

<p><strong>We Program for People, Not Profits</strong></p>
<p>Aatos is a concept that has generated large-scale interest. It is also something that we feel belongs with everyone. It should not be something that is exclusive to the brand, business, or individual that can pay the most for it.</p>

<p>Our commitment with Aatos is to create a free, open-source, drag-and-drop platform which enables any person with a computer and basic internet knowledge to use the advantages of automation.</p>
<p>There are 5 key benefits that Aatos provides each person who uses it.</p>

<p><strong>Everyone benefits from Aatos.</strong></p>
<p>Diversity shouldn’t be feared. It should be celebrated. That’s what Aatos offers. It empowers each user because it can be understood by virtually everyone. If you know how to use a mouse, then you know how to use Aatos.</p>

<h3>Tổng quan thực trạng ""giỏi"" nhưng ""chưa phù hợp""</h3>
<p>Nhìn vào thực trạng hiện nay, rất nhiều ứng viên dù mang đủ tố chất hay đã đạt được thành tích xuất sắc xứng đáng nhận được học bổng nhưng vẫn không được lựa chọn, bởi lẽ họ thiếu “một vài yếu tố” và bị đánh giá là “chưa phù hợp” đối với các chương trình học bổng lớn. Lẽ tất nhiên, việc chưa phù hợp với các chương trình học bổng mang tính cạnh tranh cao đồng nghĩa với việc ứng viên đó sẽ mất đi cơ hội được nhận học bổng.</p> <p>Ví dụ điển hình cho những sự ""chưa phù hợp"" lại vô tình gây bất công cho những người giỏi thường xuất hiện trong các chương trình học bổng lớn và có tính cạnh tranh cao như Chevening và Fulbright.</p> <p>Giả sử một sinh viên A vừa mới tốt nghiệp loại xuất sắc quyết định ứng tuyển chương trình học bổng Chevening. Sinh viên này cũng đã có kinh nghiệm làm việc bán thời gian ở vị trí quản lý những dự án có tính chất ảnh hưởng lớn và tích cực tới cộng đồng. Ta có thể nhận xét ứng viên A có đủ những phẩm chất lãnh đạo và năng lực học thuật mà học bổng Chevening yêu cầu, nhưng tiếc thay vì mới tốt nghiệp, ứng viên này lại không có ""hai năm kinh nghiệm làm việc sau khi tốt nghiệp"". Như vậy, nếu hội đồng học bổng Chevening xét tuyển một cách cứng nhắc, ứng viên này sẽ bị loại dù cho những ảnh hưởng tích cực và tiềm năng của ứng viên này có tốt đi chăng nữa.</p> <p>Hoặc lấy ví dụ một trường hợp khác, bạn B là một sinh viên xuất sắc có khả năng đại diện Việt Nam tham dự một chương trình giao lưu văn hoá quốc tế ở nước ngoài. Thế nhưng, chương trình mà sinh viên B này tham dự không có quỹ đài thọ chi phí đi lại, sinh hoạt cho đại biểu. Bạn B  muốn tìm một quỹ hỗ trợ để có thể đại diện Việt Nam tham gia chương trình giao lưu quốc tế nhưng hiện nay các quỹ học bổng ở Việt Nam đều chỉ nhắm tới cung cấp các học bổng dài hạn chứ không tài trợ cho các chương trình giao lưu ngắn hạn như đã đề cập.</p> <p>Ngoài ra cũng phải kể đến sự bất công về phân bổ tài trợ học bổng cho các ngành học. Bạn sinh viên C dù được nhận vào học tại một trường đại học danh tiếng, thế nhưng ngành học đã chọn của bạn C lại là một ngành được cộp mác “con nhà giàu"" (ví dụ như Mỹ thuật, Âm nhạc, Kinh doanh, v.v.) với mức học phí cao và chi phí phát sinh nhiều trong quá trình học nên bị rất nhiều quỹ học bổng làm ngơ. Tình trạng này trái ngược với những ngành học được đầu tư và cho nhiều học bổng như Khoa học cơ bản, Giáo dục, Môi trường và Phát triển để khuyến khích người học.</p> <p>Các ví dụ nêu trên đại diện cho rất nhiều trường hợp những cá nhân tài năng nhưng chỉ vì thiếu một vài tiêu chí nhất định (hay nói đúng hơn là vì các quỹ học bổng khác vẫn chưa quan tâm họ đúng mức) mà đành ngậm ngùi từ bỏ ước mơ.</p> <p>Chương trình học bổng Limitless, đúng như tên gọi tiếng Việt là “Không Giới Hạn"", đặt mục tiêu sẽ chắp cánh cho giấc mơ của những bạn trẻ tài năng đã bị các chương trình khác “bỏ sót"". <i><strong>Học bổng Limitless không đặt giới hạn bằng các bộ tiêu chí chung như: tuổi tác, ngành học, nghề nghiệp, hay kinh nghiệm mà sẽ xem xét rất kỹ liệu ứng viên có xứng đáng nhận được nguồn tài trợ hay không theo từng trường hợp riêng biệt (on a case-by-case basis)</strong></i>. Chúng tôi hy vọng những bạn trẻ tài năng sẽ tìm đến chúng tôi khi cần hỗ trợ.</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>Liezer-Legacy Productions is
dedicated to creating and producing quality theatrical works of comedy and
comedic works that explore and celebrate our sense of humanity and history as
Ghanaians. Since 2014, we have produced high quality contemporary works of art
that has inspired and shaped many lives. Driven by the commitment to inspire,
entertain and shape lives, our works paint a picture of life as it should be
and thus engage audiences in an exchange of ideas that makes them think harder,
laugh louder and become more objective. Aside producing stage plays, we organize
an annual 4-week Acting Training School and also run weekly comedy
shows live on two radio stations in Kumasi; <b>The PM Show</b> on Luv 99.5 FM and <b>Agorommre</b> Nhyira 104.3 FM.</p>

Ahead
of Ghana’s 2016 general elections, we are adding on 2 new projects; <b>Street
Theatre</b> and <b>Students Drama Festival</b>, in our quest to train and employ more
youthful talents as well as preach and promote peace, tolerance, unity and
democracy. Though we are not in the financial position to pay the required
minimum wages for services, we have in our own small way offered training and
employment in the arts to many youths over the years. We are committed to
ensuring Ghana comes out of the 2016 polls even stronger. We are also eager to
continue in our efforts to reduce the unemployment rate in the country.<br/><br/><h3>WHY WE ARE HERE</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>We believe society can flourish
only when its members learn to accept and respect one another as well as embrace
our responsibility to make the world a better place. Ghana’s 2016 general
elections may mar the country’s reputation as one of the most relatively
peaceful countries in Africa. The 2008 and 2012 general elections proved
turbulent but if the violence, assassinations, abuse, intimidation, seizure of
large quantity of arms and ammunitions in some parts of the country as well as
the use of vigilante groups by both the ruling NDC and the opposition NPP are
anything to go by then one can only assume and quite justifiably too that this
year’s polls is likely to prove particularly volatile.</p>
<p>As Christians and citizens
desirous of the best for our country, we are conscious of this looming danger
and are committed to using our talents and platforms to educate, admonish and
promote peace ahead of the polls. Our <b>Street
Theatre</b> will complement the efforts of our stage plays and radio shows in
creatively addressing issues. <b>The Street Theatre will see us mount stages in
our streets, lorry parks and market squares across the country to put up
educative and entertaining drama pieces as well as have resource persons address the people gathered on the need for peace, tolerance and democracy during and after the elections.</b></p>
<p>Since politicians usually induce
the youth to start riots, we intend to not only train many youths but also
employ and pay more youthful talents thus giving them purpose and a more
profitable use for their talents. We are thus here to humbly request your assistance to
help us transform our creative ideas into impactful approaches and job creating
opportunities. Your investment will not only help in shaping the lives of many
talented arts-enthusiastic youth but will also contribute immensely to Ghana’s stability
and economic rebuilding.</p>

<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>WHAT WE NEED <br/>
</h3>
<h3></h3>
<p>As a young Theatre company operating in an environment where theatre is not so  lucrative, our dream to make a difference in the lives of many youths as well as help to promote peace during the 2016 Elections seems almost an impossible one. Our current financial standing can only take us through 2 successful Street Theatre projects. Going for a loan like we usually do will be a big set back since we intend to make the Street Theatre a free-for-all project so as to be able to reach the masses with our campaign for peace. <br/></p>
<p>We need funds to take care of production costs such as transportation, welfare, accommodation, renting fee for the stage, fees for sound system, remuneration, facilitation for resource persons, among others. We believe with support from donors like you, we will not only help in shaping the lives of many talented
arts-enthusiastic youth but will also contribute immensely to Ghana’s stability
and economic rebuilding.

</p>
<p>This campaign is very important to us because it will help us stay true to our vision of traveling across the country to preach and promote peace, tolerance, democracy and unity ahead of Ghana's 2016 polls. It will also help us contribute immensely to strengthening of the arts industry by undertaking projects that will seek to train and employ more youth.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>OUR FUTURE<br/>
</h3>The future of our company is full of risks and possibilities. We will continue to build relationships, provide job opportunities and offer cultural education to create and sustain a vibrant Theatre hub in Kumasi. We hope that 
you will support our vision by donating to this campaign.<br/>

promote peace ahead of the polls. Our Street
Theatre will complement the efforts of our stage plays and radio shows in
creatively addressing issues. The Street Theatre will see us mount stages in
our streets, lorry parks and market squares across the country to put up
educative and entertaining drama pieces as well as have resource persons address the people gathered on the need for peace, tolerance and democracy during and after the elections.
Since politicians usually induce
the youth to start riots, we intend to not only train many youths but also
employ and pay more youthful talents thus giving them purpose and a more
profitable use for their talents. We are thus here to humbly request your assistance to
help us transform our creative ideas into impactful approaches and job creating
opportunities. Your investment will not only help in shaping the lives of many
talented arts-enthusiastic youth but will also contribute immensely to Ghana’s stability
and economic rebuilding.



  WHAT WE NEED 


As a young Theatre company operating in an environment where theatre is not so  lucrative, our dream to make a difference in the lives of many youths as well as help to promote peace during the 2016 Elections seems almost an impossible one. Our current financial standing can only take us through 2 successful Street Theatre projects. Going for a loan like we usually do will be a big set back since we intend to make the Street Theatre a free-for-all project so as to be able to reach the masses with our campaign for peace. 
We need funds to take care of production costs such as transportation, welfare, accommodation, renting fee for the stage, fees for sound system, remuneration, facilitation for resource persons, among others. We believe with support from donors like you, we will not only help in shaping the lives of many talented
arts-enthusiastic youth but will also contribute immensely to Ghana’s stability
and economic rebuilding.


This campaign is very important to us because it will help us stay true to our vision of traveling across the country to preach and promote peace, tolerance, democracy and unity ahead of Ghana's 2016 polls. It will also help us contribute immensely to strengthening of the arts industry by undertaking projects that will seek to train and employ more youth.
  OUR FUTURE
The future of our company is full of risks and possibilities. We will continue to build relationships, provide job opportunities and offer cultural education to create and sustain a vibrant Theatre hub in Kumasi. We hope that 
you will support our vision by donating to this campaign.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

The first Center for Early Innovation in Colombia's goal is to promote social development through advances in science and technology, so we need to create an environment that enables creative thinking and be able to sustain and develop entrepreneurs. The initiative was born in Don Diego, Sierra Nevada, Colombia.
Don Diego is a small community of farmers and indigenous people who had to bear the full force of violence and war; still they maintain their hope and want to move on.  It is essential that they rebuild their school, this is a symbol of unity, hope and strength. Currently the school is completely abandoned. When this school is revived it will benefit more than 100 families living in this area by becoming the community center.

Impact

The only real element that has to be transformed in society is the education of its citizens. It is true that we live in a painfully unequal world where the birthplace often determines the fate of people. However, it is always possible to make use of the power of solidarity to turn the tide of those destinations marked by exclusion, war and indifference.
If we can revive this school for a healthy space to provide quality education to children and youth, we can bring advances in science, art, technique and technology to a section of the rural sector.
With the help of committed people symbols of hope and unity can spread across the world. Please contribute to train competent citizens able to manage worthy meeting spaces that encourage meaningful learning; in this way we will be sure to deliver to the world generations of respectful subjects of their environment and their peers, away from crime, prostitution and war.
I've worked in impoverished areas and know closely the pain of poverty. More so, I've seen the ability of regeneration and transformation that we human beings are capable of.
The earth responds to care, human and social fabric respond to partnerships.
This Innovation Center will provide more than 100 families the opportunity to have access to technological tools, advances in science and also a fun and healthy learning environment.



Risks and Challenges
Although we do not condone it, the reality is that some armed groups still operating in the area; This situation is a challenge to any social development initiative. However, we are confident in the strength of the arguments in favor of youth away from violence, that when put in a neutral space that promotes education, art and culture there will be change.
Accompaniment and support of the community and civic associations are also our great shield. They are the people in the population who will ensure the safety and success of this initiative. For the past two years the political and party neutrality has supported what we do.

I want it to be real, and  whoever going to support me to read my story and if they will have faith and believe in me, I'd be very proud of their support and will never let them down. I don't give promises I can't keep, because I don't have to at the first place. And you can always watch me either live on Periscope or Watch my videos on Katch.me links are below.</p><p>My name is Saed, a young man with big dreams. I am 23 years old. 1st scoper at <a href=""https://www.periscope.tv/saed_habib"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Periscope  </a>from Gaza, I scope about love, unity, positiveness, music, food and more. I currently live in the far east of Gaza city ( Shuja'iyya neighborhood, you may need to Google that ) in Palestine. Our house were partly destroyed during the last conflict in June 2014, and I have worked hard and spent all my money on rebuilding it. I have been through many hard times and never asked people to help me out even back in the days when I survived on $2 only for almost a week and lived in schools while I had no home to stay, Because I believe what doesn't kill you, makes you stronger ... </p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I have a dream that I've been chasing for over 5 years now hopefully its time to come true</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">, My dream to study abroad started back in 2010, when I finished my high school. I applied for several international scholarships, with no luck but yet this didn't put me down. I picked myself up and 5 years later, proudly achieved my Bachelors degree in Information Technology - Multimedia and Web Development -</span></span></p><p>Living in Gaza can be tough but every day is a new adventure. As an I.T. student I had to manage my time of work and study with only 6-8 hours of electricity everyday. This was made harder as most of my books were electronic copies, plus my homework was a software deliverable. So trying to learn and live in such circumstances teaches you a lot, and makes you appreciate simple things even more!  </p><p></p><p>The moment I received my degree I started applying for scholarships again to further my education and meanwhile I was also taking a Deutsche ( German ) course, as my Plan A was to study in UK or USA and my  plan B was to go to Germany. Unfortunately once again, my attempts to gain a scholarship were unsuccessful,  but that didn't put me down and I kept on going. I know I can wait for next years and apply once again, But do I have to spend too many years on waiting? One of my friends was very lucky to gain a scholarship but this was after SEVEN years of trying! So I thought I should find another way, and here comes my campaign. </p><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><b></b></span></p><p><b>My Bachelor Degree:</b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456957572/it1lhqvkwgv8bmpev8ru.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><b>My German language Certificate:</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456957964/vpazjqbwcdigxutteiqx.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><div><p><b>A photo from my graduation party in June 2015 - I was also one of the best 10 students among my colleagues I got 91% in one of the semesters, and my overall GPA was 80.58%.</b></p></div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456960720/k6tkmgqkaxinibahroar.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456961536/ngrb9fw7amky1t0huxlr.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><b>Scholarships I applied for but no luck:</b><div>

</div></div>","Hello Wonderful People ! Thank you so much for taking the time to read about my dream! I didn't want to create a video for my campaign as most people do and have an emotionally appealing music in the background to draw an illusion and get to people feelings .. I want it to be real, and  whoever going to support me to read my story and if they will have faith and believe in me, I'd be very proud of their support and will never let them down. I don't give promises I can't keep, because I don't have to at the first place. And you can always watch me either live on Periscope or Watch my videos on Katch.me links are below.My name is Saed, a young man with big dreams. I am 23 years old. 1st scoper at Periscope  from Gaza, I scope about love, unity, positiveness, music, food and more. I currently live in the far east of Gaza city ( Shuja'iyya neighborhood, you may need to Google that ) in Palestine. Our house were partly destroyed during the last conflict in June 2014, and I have worked hard and spent all my money on rebuilding it. I have been through many hard times and never asked people to help me out even back in the days when I survived on $2 only for almost a week and lived in schools while I had no home to stay, Because I believe what doesn't kill you, makes you stronger ... I have a dream that I've been chasing for over 5 years now hopefully its time to come true, My dream to study abroad started back in 2010, when I finished my high school. I applied for several international scholarships, with no luck but yet this didn't put me down. I picked myself up and 5 years later, proudly achieved my Bachelors degree in Information Technology - Multimedia and Web Development -Living in Gaza can be tough but every day is a new adventure. As an I.T. student I had to manage my time of work and study with only 6-8 hours of electricity everyday. This was made harder as most of my books were electronic copies, plus my homework was a software deliverable. So trying to learn and live in such circumstances teaches you a lot, and makes you appreciate simple things even more!  The moment I received my degree I started applying for scholarships again to further my education and meanwhile I was also taking a Deutsche ( German ) course, as my Plan A was to study in UK or USA and my  plan B was to go to Germany. Unfortunately once again, my attempts to gain a scholarship were unsuccessful,  but that didn't put me down and I kept on going. I know I can wait for next years and apply once again, But do I have to spend too many years on waiting? One of my friends was very lucky to gain a scholarship but this was after SEVEN years of trying! So I thought I should find another way, and here comes my campaign. My Bachelor Degree:My German language Certificate:A photo from my graduation party in June 2015 - I was also one of the best 10 students among my colleagues I got 91% in one of the semesters, and my overall GPA was 80.58%.Scholarships I applied for but no luck:
Said Foundation Scholarship:


The Chevening Scholarship:


and many more ..

What I want to study and Why?

I want to study Entrepreneurship and innovation; to combine it with my I.T. knowledge, skills and experience and create things that will help unemployed people, refugees and hopefully the underprivileged to have a better life! 
Unfortunately at this moment, nowhere in Gaza is offering any Entrepreneurship/innovation courses nor are there enough resources in Gaza to innovate. That means when I return home I will be the 1st Gazan ever to hold such a degree!
Why you should support me and How can I help unemployed and refugees? 
Whilst studying my bachelors degree, I worked with an international organization  Mercy Corps  in Gaza as a Freelancers' mentor and my main role was to help, mentor and train other students to become successful freelancers and build up their freelancing career. I mentored 15 graduates while I was studying myself and helped them make it! So I hope after pursuing my master from Germany I will be able to help more and more people, not only in Gaza but worldwide!
Recommendation I received from my previous employer at Mercy Corps - Gaza office. ( It was used for a scholarship I applied for ) 


In Oct 2015, I was selected by World Health Organization HQ in Geneva to do an internship with the Surge and Crisis Support Unit, and I gained a greater experience and skills. I want to volunteer with my free time, to work with humanitarian organizations in Germany as I'm able to speak Arabic, English and German. I love volunteering and I hope with the additional knowledge I learn in a masters degree I can help even more.
Recommendation I received on Linkedin from my supervisor at WHO HQ.

One more thing, I love volunteering! I have spent over 5 years of my life doing voluntary work, because it bought me what money will never do! Feel free to read more about my voluntary work at Linkedin Profile

share the outcome of our story with you!</b></p><p><b><br/></b></p><br/><br/></div>","Why the campaign?On the
evening of January the 20th the I2B Skatepark in Somerset West,
South Africa, caught fire.  We rushed to
the skatepark after receiving the news only to find that our attempts to kill
this raging fire would not nearly be good enough. Minutes later the Fire
Department arrived – unfortunately not in time to save the parts of the large
ramp and shading net that were damaged.The I2B
Skatepark is one of the main projects of our Non-Profit Organisation (NGO),
Inspired2Become. One of the aims of the I2B Skatepark project is to motivate
youth to live a positive, active lifestyle. We run a weekly club at the
skatepark for local Helderberg youth and another club for children from the
Brightlights safe house. We also partner with the NGO, Pebbles Project, where
we run a club for the children from the surrounding farms.
It saddened our
hearts to see all the hard work that went into the project burn to the ground. We
want to raise funds in order to rebuild the I2B Skatepark, expand the park to
make it more family friendly and raise additional funds for our NGO,
Inspired2Become (I2B).What is Inspired2Become (I2B)?
I2B was founded in 2010 by two small town brothers, Chris and
Fanie van der Merwe. Chris is a qualified professional rollerblader and has
competed in competitions around the world, including the Asian x Games and the
Dubai X Games. Fanie, was a gold medalist at the 2008 and 2012 Paralympic
games. These two brothers saw the need of South African youth to rise from the
challenges their communities and their disabilities hold. I2B Action Sports
Chris
focuses on alternative action sport clubs in different areas of the Western
Cape. He runs skateboarding, rollerblading and skimboarding clubs in the
following areas: Cloetesville, Strand, Gordon’s Bay, Somerset West, Kleinvlei,
Macassar, Bonteheuwel and Belhar.Chris also
builds skateparks as part of the organization’s projects. He is currently
focusing on rebuilding/upgrading the I2B Skatepark in Somerset West. He also
gave plans to the municipality of Stellenbosch to rebuild the I2B Cloetesville Skatepark.
The previous skatepark that Chris built in this developing area has been
targeted and vandalized to the point that the only thing left of the park is a
metal rail. Chris now wants to build a cement park once the plans have been
approved.I2B Athletics for youth with disabilities
Fanie
coaches youth with disabilities from the Alta du Toit School as well as from
the Pioneer School for the Blind. Both Fanie and Chris also do life skills
lesson with the youth.I2B Educational
Therapy
During 2016 the I2B focus areas have shifted from developing
youth through sport to developing youth in general. Jami van der Merwe, a
speech therapist (and Chris’s wife!), joined the I2B team. She worked at a special
school in Mitchell’s Plain for 6 years. Jami will function as the administrative
officer of the organization as well as a project manager. Her aim is to start therapeutic
groups at Raithby Primary school with learners from developing areas. She will focus mainly on literacy and language therapy.How can you help?

<p>My passion for understanding people took me to studying DISC behavioral profiles which uncover our innate and descriptive behaviors. I then layered in Emotional Intelligence to understand how our personal energy affects others not only in the workplace but in all walks of life. Early in my career I studied etiquette which discusses self-leadership and diversity. These interests, if you will, drove me to design a tool that could help people at all levels and all walks of life be present and emotionally available to those they serve.</p>
<p> From owning businesses in the US and Europe, in working with diplomats, film stars to college students I began to notice a trend, a kind of common thread that was prevalent in many people (certainly not all, but many). This thread brought about anxiety, frustration, and confusion and in general a dissatisfaction for life no matter how much money or status they had. This common thread was a lack of self-confidence, a lack of self-leadership and emotional awareness which seemed to have a trickle down effect to those around them. I could watch and observe people running down the rabbit hole, making mountains out of mole hills, pointing the finger in the opposite direction. Going nowhere and feeling disillusioned. Generally just not <strong><span>present </span></strong>in their life.</p>

Next place the disc where you can get to it easily throughout the day maybe in a jacket pocket or in your purse, some place easily accessible so that when your day seems to be spiraling out of control or you have gotten off course and need to come back to center you can just reach in your pocket or purse (just like grabbing your security blanket) and pull out the word.</p>

Hi my name is Merry Lynch and I was one of the lucky ones. At a very young age I had the opportunity to meet Zig Ziglar,Wayne Dyer,Charles “Tremendous” Jones,Les Brown and then I began to follow others. The conclusion I drew between my own experiences and of these masterful speakers was the discussion I kept hearing about the same 30 or so words. These 30 words that I would hear over and over again in books, speeches, in what I was learning as well as in what I was training others on were powerful, yet there was something missing. It is too easy to revert back to our old ways of behaving, our old ways of being, that were not serving us. Something deeper needed to change.



My passion for understanding people took me to studying DISC behavioral profiles which uncover our innate and descriptive behaviors. I then layered in Emotional Intelligence to understand how our personal energy affects others not only in the workplace but in all walks of life. Early in my career I studied etiquette which discusses self-leadership and diversity. These interests, if you will, drove me to design a tool that could help people at all levels and all walks of life be present and emotionally available to those they serve.
 From owning businesses in the US and Europe, in working with diplomats, film stars to college students I began to notice a trend, a kind of common thread that was prevalent in many people (certainly not all, but many). This thread brought about anxiety, frustration, and confusion and in general a dissatisfaction for life no matter how much money or status they had. This common thread was a lack of self-confidence, a lack of self-leadership and emotional awareness which seemed to have a trickle down effect to those around them. I could watch and observe people running down the rabbit hole, making mountains out of mole hills, pointing the finger in the opposite direction. Going nowhere and feeling disillusioned. Generally just not present in their life.


It Was An Itch That Wouldn't Go Away




So I went back to these 30 words that I kept hearing from great leaders and philosophers and researched them further to uncover their original meaning through etymology (the study of the existence or beginning of language). I looked at each word and how it was originally used to carry us forward and influence others and joined each word with a poignant and powerful quote that I had collected over the years. 
Words have built, destroyed and aligned great countries, people and ideas. Napoleon Bonaparte renounced “Four hostile newspapers are more to be feared than a thousand bayonets.” The celebrated author and rabbi,Yehuda Berg states that “words are singularly the most powerful force available to humanity.”
With this knowledge in hand I dug deeper and married each word with a select set of questions. The questions are meant for the recipient to take a deep dive into the meaning to develop an emotional bond with the word that will be carried with them throughout the day and beyond.


That is when Confidence in a Can was born. Confidence in a Can – one day, one word, for 30 days. Bring focus, clarity, understanding and confidence back into your life. This game can be played alone, with a team, your family members, in a group, whatever works for you.


Creating confidence and regaining control of your life or having the courage to make some changes is going to require you to do something different, to be someone different. That is where Confidence in a Can comes in.

Change Your Words, Change Your Life




Each day for 30 days you set a daily intention. This might be how you want to show up in an interview, or how you need to be in a disciplinary conversation with an employee, or maybe in overcoming a challenge at home. Your intention might sound as simple as this: Today I will smile more or as challenging as Today I will confront my boss.

Intentions guide us to shape our lives rather than live my default and letting our unconscious and conscious minds influence us. Setting a daily intention brings about deliberate awareness. Intentions are about creating the life experience that you truly want while staying connected to your values and living a life joy.
Then grab the “can” -  give it a good shake  -  open it up and without peaking, pull out a disc  -  just one. Oh…and you can’t put it back if you don’t like it. I know who you are, just don’t do it.

Test Marketing and What We Need From YOU


 In order to get Confidence in a Can to market we need to raise $10,000 and we can't do it without your support. The funds raised will go directly to the manufacturer in the US and then once completed will go to the fulfillment center and into your home or business. 
Having designed, manufactured and sold other products throughout the US and Europe my team and I are anxious for the success of this launch and to see the lives that will change because of this product. 
We have spent the last few years test marketing this product in a luxury department store in California, in networking groups and women's organizations as well as in private Facebook challenges. The kinks are gone and what remains is a transformative product for all ages and all demographics.
    
Risks & Challenges

 We have been working tirelessly to deter any obstacles that might come our way. With experience in manufacturing and product development we believe we have crossed all the t's and dotted all the i's. With that being said the one date we are coming up against is Christmas. At the time of this launch we may run into a problem with Christmas deliveries however to combat that we have designed a special card that will have a Confidence in a Can disc inside stating their gift is on it's way. So although the ideal is to have the actual product in hand, should that not take place we have addressed the issue ahead of time.
    Share the Love There are ways in which everyone can help. In getting Confidence in a Can to market help shows up in all different ways. Here are a few ideas for supporting this product launch:  Click the share button and engage with your followers on Facebook, Twitter, Pintrest, LinkedIn or where ever else you use social media.

<h3>Mindful Beauty is a natural cosmetic company based in Ireland that has now also trained nearly 2500 people through our mindfulness meditation programs through our training company Learning to Exhale. Our social enterprise has completed training in ten HSE hospitals and has been offering mindfulness training to communities at a significantly reduced rate. Our natural and award winning cosmetics are available from over 600 stores.</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>We now wish to send 250 HSE nurses our Mindful Beauty Nurses Gift Box who are working on the COVID frontlines with this crowdfund campaign. We are looking for 250 people to sponsor a Nurses Gift Box and we will send it directly to them for you.</h3>

<h3> </h3>
<p>We have the addresses and contact details of 1000 HSE nurses we have trained, so we could with your support get one thousand of our Nurses Gift Boxes out to them before Christmas with your generosity and with enough backers.</p>
<p>You will make a big difference to a nurse by sponsoring a box.</p>
<h3>You will help her sleep, sooth her feet, relieve her aches and pains and protect her from the flu with our nurses box.</h3>
<p>Some Irish hospitals are beginning to enter crisis points with the strain COVID is placing on medical staff and services. Self-care is very important as a nurse but even more so in this time. This is one way as a nation we can encourage nurses in terms of self-care.</p>
<p>If we exceed the funding goal we will also organise more Mindful Beauty Spa Days which we already sponsor for HSE nurses. If we super exceed the goal we will also run Mindful Beauty Self Esteem &amp; Self Compassion Workshops for vulnerable teens who have been referred to see a psychiatrist and many of whom have been waiting up to two years to see one.</p>
<h3>If you would like to purchase one of our gift boxes for yourself here you will still be contributing to Mindful Beauty Day for HSE nurses and helping teens in crisis and getting yourself, family and friends a treat from our range of gift boxes!</h3>

<p>We can send your box to you, your family of friends anywhere in Europe through our contracted courier company. As soon as you pay for your box on this crowdfunder we will start preparing boxes for dispatch immediately. When the fundraiser closes all the boxes we aim to dispatch all boxes on the 11th of Dec to reach destinations by the 20th of Dec. We cannot ship to anywhere outside of the European Union but can to anywhere within: Ireland, UK, France, Spain, Italy, Germany, The Netherlands and so on.</p>
<p>We have now taken over 160 HSE nurses, for FREE, to Mindful Beauty Spa Day that we sponsor consisting of hot stone massage, reflexology, facials, Indian head massage and manicures. We also sponsor all the products used. How fab is that!? If we surpass the campaign goal, we will try and run as many as we can of these Spa Days throughout the country with a portion of the funds.  Check it out here...</p>

Imagine how much more we could do with some funding from the public?’ So go fund us. Back us to do more of this life changing work with people in Ireland and further afield.</p>

<p>Now more than ever do these nurses need protection from burnout and compassion fatigue; being on the frontlines of COVID and giving quite selfless service while actually putting their own lives at risk.

<h3>The Homeschool Classroom Playground</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Rebecca Cohen, Head Teacher at The Homeschool Classroom in Santa Fe, a small school for children ages 5-14.  We have been serving Homeschool Families in Santa Fe for the past 10 years.  It is a scientific fact that kids learn easier, faster and retain more information, IF they have physical activity during the learning day.  The Homeschool Classroom has a large field for a play area, however it is filled with gravel, goatheads (sharp and dangerous plants) and holes in the ground.  we are in GREAT NEED of a SAFE running space for our kids.  With Covid-19 inspiring many more families to Homeschool their children, our services are greater demand.  We have a great big outdoor tent for moving the lessons outside, however our running space needs improvement.  </p>

Kiri teaches children critical skills through play.Montessori Materials: Inspired by classic wooden blocks, Kiri is made from natural materials providing a calming, environment. Includes 2 tile packsOnce you purchase, you'll be able to choose 2 of the following tile packs as part of your Kiri Starter Pack. We'll send you a survey at the end of the campaign to let us know your choices. Over the past 2 years, we've tested Kiri with hundreds of people and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. Kiri is loved by:
Parents
Kids
Teachers
Guidance counselors
Speech therapists
Parents of special-needs children
Children with autism
 For children of all abilitiesKiri was uniquely created for children of all learning abilities. We spent hours collaborating with parents and children with different abilities in order to help it meet the needs of this unique and special community.Kiri is able to teach children with Autism, Down Syndrome, Developmental Delays, Learning Disabilities, and more. Its approachable look and friendly voice promote speech development, cognitive development, manipulative dexterity and much more! For our nonverbal friends, Kiri can even become the voice to express their needs. Eco-friendlyKiri is made using natural materials, meaning you're not adding to the plastic toy collection.  Kiri is the Japanese name for the fastest growing tree in the world, the paulownia or ""princess tree"". In Japan, it was once customary to plant a Kiri tree when a baby girl was born. The girl and the tree would grow until she reached the age of marriage, at which point the tree would be cut down and used to make a dowry chest for her family.We believe that small childhood investments will have a big impact on the future. From early concepts like color identification and fine motor skills to more advanced concepts like languages, memorization, and mathematics, Kiri will grow with your child. We are Harvard, Stanford, and BYU-trained engineers, designers, teachers & entrepreneurs.When we started building Kiri nearly 2 years ago, we set out to create something that’s versatile, adaptive, grows with your child, and - most importantly - fun.Our goal is to provide the best learning toy your child will ever use and are committed to this promise. This crowdfunding campaign is only the first step in our plan to reach that goal, and we will continue to add more packs and other products to pair with the Kiri block to enhance learning and fun!

  Shipping is a process and has the potential to cause problems if not handled correctly. We aim to provide you with the best prices. The cost of shipping is based on your shipping address and will be added to your order. This is at cost, so we won't make any money from it. We will always keep shipping information transparent and work hard to make the process as easy as possible.For international buyers, you are responsible for any customs fees. We recommend you find out about your customs regulations and fees, so you can receive your Kiri hassle-free. Risks and challengesWe have a high-fidelity prototype and are working with our manufacturer to bring Kiri to life but we need your help in order to fulfill the quantity required. COVID is a risk and may cause disruptions to our global supply chain. Because we have designed a system instead of a one-off product, we will be diligent in overseeing the production of each piece. Environmental commitmentsLong-lasting designUnlike most toys that are only useful for a very short time and for one specific use, Kiri is highly versatile and adaptable, ensuring it can be useful for many years. Kids can start using Kiri at age 1 and continue all the way to age 6+ since lessons gradually increase in difficulty and adapt to the child's development. We ensure Kiri will still be ready to use for years to come by using only high-quality durable materials: real solid wood, durable card stock, and cotton cases.Reusability and recyclabilityWe plan to offer take-back programs and allow users to receive a discount on upgrades if they return the original unit with free return shipping.Sustainable materialsPlastic toys are a major contributor to plastic pollution. We use natural and sustainable materials: our blocks are wood, tiles are durable card stock, and all carrying cases and totes are cotton.Eco-friendly factoriesThe manufacturing partner we contracted with has a detailed plan for how to minimize its impact on the environment, including reducing its carbon footprint and limiting the materials it uses during manufacturing.Sustainable distributionWe plan to use a fulfillment service that has several locations in different geographical regions of the US to ensure individual deliveries travel the least possible distances, minimizing our carbon footprint.Sustainability is built into our coreKiri was built from scratch to be environmentally-friendly and sustainable because of the adverse impact most toys (which are made from plastic) have on the environment. Sustainability is built into its core. Our goal was to build the best toy that is naturally-simple and aesthetically-pleasing to fit within the modern home.",43.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>Introducing a newly invented 3D puzzle: C-Maze</h3>
<p>Want to improve your spatial-thinking skills? Challenge yourself or someone you know? Try C-Maze!</p>
<p>C-Maze is a 3D dynamic maze puzzle. Imagine covering a cube with a maze. Then break the maze into six parts and make each part rotatable independently. Now it becomes C-Maze!</p>
<p>The goal is to move an indicator from a starting position to a finish position by finding a continuous path through six rotatable faces.</p>

hands-on, and experiential learning model to students, Agastya
International Foundation has been bridging the gap in the
conventional, rote-based education system in India since 1999. </p>
<p> So
far, we have directly impacted the lives of over 8 million
underprivileged students and 200,000 teachers across 17+ states in
rural India. This has been a feat that has left several social
innovators, freethinkers, aspiring social entrepreneurs and
development experts from around the world deeply interested to learn
from the approach and methodology used.  </p>
<p>What was the approach taken? How was the approach defined and adapted to changing circumstances? What were the challenges faced? How were they solved? How did Agastya innovate? Can this model be replicated? What will it take to build such a system? <br/></p>
<p>Providing
answers to these questions and beyond, the MurthyNAYAK Foundation,
one of our friends and supporters, chronicled the journey of
our organisation over the last 15 years in the book,
Wisdom of Agastya.

To dream small is to be unrealistic; conditioning your mindset will allow you to leave a legacy one day.

""The End of the Line"" helped force companies and governments to change their policies through screenings at the United Nations, the European Commission, and US House of Representatives. ""Warren W Ryan - Empowering The World"" will change the way society deals with the experiences that hundreds of thousands of people are dealing with - RIGHT NOW. What Will You See In This DocuFilm?Warren will be taking you back to where it all started for him, visiting the locations where he was brought up, put into care and where he dealt with his depression and suicidal tendencies that cover various locations around the UK and America.As well as interviews with the man himself, there will be interviews with the people involved in his life, from his siblings, his mother, his co-workers and friends at the time, as well as an inside look at the events he organises, the lives he's changed and his future ambitions to create a better life for everyone. What Do We Need?We have support from speakers and organisations all around the world for this documentary and it's message - ensuring we have a solid foundation for world wide distribution.Now we need to raise the money to hire a professional film crew to start filming here in the UK and in America.Thankfully, we have access to an award winning director and a team of professional cameramen and editors who resonate with our cause- but they have families to feed too, and the more we can support the teams who are supporting us, the more we can achieve together!The target covers:Hire of Cameras, lighting equipment, sound equipment, cameramen, sound person, lighting person, travel, accommodation when required, editor and editing suite, and marketing materials.Currently, we are budgeting for the minimum amount we can get away with to produce this DocuFilm. If we exceed our goal, every penny raised will go back into the production and distribution of this important film - enabling us to make it even better, and get it seen by even more people.  A Short Message From Warren Inspire Ryan:""Through my life experiences thus far, I have learnt that nothing can hit you as hard as life itself.Through all of my pain, my faith in God has kept me believing through the good and the bad; I’ve found and stayed on a straight and narrow path. I’ve had to make sacrifices from things I can live without to the people I love and mean everything to me.I was born a leader, and to lead by example and show that no matter how bad your start in life may have been, there’s a way out.Its all about your attitude.Some people use their pain mountains and get into a cycle of self pity. To dream small is to be unrealistic; conditioning your mindset will allow you to leave a legacy one day. I found the cure to my depression in helping others. Making someone else’s life better gave my life meaning.I would never want to change my past because it made me who I am today. I wish and plan to reach out to as many people as possible and impart the belief that THEY can truly change their circumstances.Thank you.""Thank you for supporting this cause, you are changing lives.If you would like to know more, please contact us directly and we'll be happy to talk to you!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have many assets and resources in place, including books, websites, two completed shows, Dr. Kather’s clinic and Foxtrail Farms. We need video and editing equipment, research instruments, additional metabolic testing equipment, food processing equipment, money for staff and legal fees.  If we do not reach 100% our fundraising  goals, we  will apply the funds to the most pressing need: making Healthy Skeptics membership an exciting value.</p>
<p>The reward program includes signed books, Healthy Skeptics memberships, advanced health screening tests with consultations, as well as product discounts.</p>
<p><strong>$10 backers</strong> receive one month Healthy Skeptics membership (Value $10)</p>
<p><strong>$25 backers</strong> receive one month Healthy Skeptics membership plus one signed book (The Metabolic Plan)</p>
<p><strong>$50 backers</strong> receive two books: The Metabolic Makeover and The Metabolic Plan, plus 3-month free membership (total value: $65)</p>
<p><strong>$100 backers</strong> receive two books plus 8 months’ free membership (Total value $120)</p>
<p><strong>$500 backers:</strong> receive two books, 2 years’ membership, plus one of the following: ANSHA test with consultation at Advanced Family Wellness in Olympia WA. Or (if travel to WA is inconvenient) advanced blood testing in a lab near you, with consultation by phone. (total value: approximately $750)</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i><i>Description: </i>ANSHA stands for Autonomic Nervous System Health Assessment. All functions of the human body are controlled or influenced by the nervous system. Some movement and sensory functions (vision, touch) are voluntary. Everything else is regulated by the autonomic nervous system (ANS), including circulation (heart and blood vessels) temperature regulation, digestion and metabolism. The ANS is divided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches.</i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">As Stephen explained in The Metabolic Plan, the sympathetic nervous system drives catabolic activity associated with the fight or flight response.Sympathetic output increases heart rate, breathing, liver functions related to energy needs as well as glucose release. Parasympathetic activity is generally anabolic, associated with repair and restore functions. As you can imagine, optimum health requires a balanced coordination of these activities and that can now be measured with a sophisticated technology known as ANSHA. Importantly, ANSHA is FDA-approved and insurance reimbursable. Insurance companies cover this test because it predicts disease and degeneration, which saves them money, and reduces health risks for you.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">You will be instructed to avoid stimulants like caffeine on the day of the test. In our clinic, you will be fitted with EEG leads to evaluate cardiovascular function, a blood pressure cuff and a pulse wave analyzer. All three technologies simultaneously feed information to the ANSHA device which analyzes the interaction (cross talk) between your nervous system, your heart, and blood vessels. At the end of this 20 minute assessment, you will receive a full report, including EEG, blood vessel elasticity, heart rate variability and a calculated biological age associated with the balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity. </p>
<p><strong>$1,000 backers:</strong> receive all the above plus one additional test, lifetime membership and 25% product discount for three years (additional tests include Cardio Coach™ cardiopulmonary testing).</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>Description:  This level of metabolic testing was once reserved for elite athletes looking to create the ultimate strategy for training and competition. But in 2009, Dr. Kather became one of the first Family Practice physicians to understand the critical value of metabolic testing for any health conscious man or woman. In this test, you will obtain baseline oxygen utilization while wearing the CardioCoach mask. This advanced technology measures the exchange rate of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the resting state.</i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Then comes the fun part. You are placed on a bicycle ergometer and asked to pedal against increasing resistance. As your muscles demand more oxygen to fuel this effort, the Cardio Coach measures how well your lungs and blood vessels provide the required oxygen, and precisely when your metabolism shifts from aerobic (using oxygen) to anaerobic (using a different fuel delivery known as glycolysis / pyruvate). This information can help athletes to fine-tune training to optimize muscle fiber conditioning. Runners will have a remarkably different focus compared to weight-lifters.</i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>This information, however, can be life-changing for <strong>anyone</strong> who understands the core truth that “muscle is magic.” The information derived from Cardio Coach testing will help us design an exercise program specific to your current metabolic state, so that you get the most benefit from the least effort. At Advanced Family Wellness, we understand that most people do not want to work out in a gym for 2 hours, three days a week. Our goal is to generate a personalized exercise routine which provides maximum benefit from 10 to 15 minutes of targeted exercise. This performance test provides valuable data on the following metabolic biomarkers:</i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>* VO2 MAX (also maximal oxygen consumption, maximal oxygen uptake or maximal aerobic capacity)</i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>* Anaerobic Threshold (AT) There is tremendous benefit in increasing AT, especially if fat-loss is your goal. Our trainers will help you design an exercise program that promotes fat-burning.</i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>For athletes, increasing AT enhances both endurance and cardiovascular performance.</i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>* Calories burned and Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR)</i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>This is a scientific measurement of how many calories a person is burning during a day, a vital piece of information when designing a weight loss regimen.</i></p>
<p><strong>$5,000 backers:</strong> receive… all the above, lifetime membership, and 30% product discount for 5 years</p>
<p><strong>$10,000 backers:</strong> receive the Platinum reward package called the Comprehensive Evaluation. Prior to your visit, you will have blood drawn at a facility convenient to you for testing. When results are in, you will fly First Class to Seattle, travel by limo to Dr. Kather’s clinic, where you will have additional tests to evaluate cardiopulmonary and metabolic fitness, followed by consultation with Stephen and Natalie to create a treatment plan for you to discuss with your primary care physician. Limo will take you to your hotel, and drive you to the airport the following day. Thereafter, you will enjoy lifetime Healthy  Skeptics membership and a 50% product discount for 5 years.</p>

<ul><li>This paradox is rarely understood because we are too busy to consider how our technology has outstripped our biology; how we are in a very real sense, out of synch with our genes.  The Healthy Skeptics approach is not to harken back to some pre-agricultural paleo panacea, but to look at ways to harmonize this 21st century experience with our ancient genetic programming. Thus, attention to diet, lifestyle, exercise, sleep and stress management are all based on a deep understanding of evolutionary biology, as explained in The Metabolic Makeover and discussed in The Healthy Skeptics interactive forum.</li></ul>

<h3>Our Background</h3>
<p>Stephen Cherniske taught Clinical Nutrition for the UCLA Department of Continuing Education in Health Science. He served on the faculty of the American College of Sports Medicine and directed the nation’s first FDA-licensed clinical lab specializing in nutrition and immunology. He is a patent holder in biotechnology, and also a best-selling author, with over a million copies in print. </p>
<p>His wife, Natalie Kather, is a double board-certified Family Medicine physician who has served as principal investigator for clinical trials in both the pharmaceutical and natural products arena. They have assembled a team of experts for this important endeavor, including individuals with advanced degrees in molecular biology, genetics, bioinformatics and organic chemistry</p>
<p>We have the training, experience and passion to create this important endeavor. Stephen’s training in health science started in 1968, with a course in dietetics for VISTA volunteer service. In the 1970’s he helped to create Integral Health Services in Putnam, Connecticut; considered the first truly integrative medical clinic in North America. Moving to Los Angeles in 1980, he taught university clinical nutrition and directed the nation’s first federally licensed clinical lab specializing in nutrition and immunology. With a passion for sports nutrition, Stephen served on the faculty of the American College of Sports Medicine, and was nutritional consultant to members of the 1984 US Track and Field team.</p>
<p>Three years later, he moved to Santa Barbara to write. His first book, The DHEA Breakthrough (Random House, 1996) became an international best seller in 90 days. That was followed by Caffeine Blues (Warner, 1998) The Metabolic Plan (Random House 2003) and The Metabolic Makeover (Altea Media, 2014).  With more than one million copies in print, Stephen is one of the most widely read authors in the Health and Wellness category.  In 1998, Stephen co-founded Oasis Wellness Network / Univera. Over the next 19 years, serving first as President and then Chief Scientific Officer, his research team published 72 studies in peer-reviewed biomedical journals, created the world’s largest functional medicinal plant library and filed for more than 180 patents.</p>
<p>Dr. Natalie Kather took a less eclectic and more demanding path. Graduating with honors at every stage of her education, she received her Medical Degree in 1996. Natalie was disappointed at the “drugs first” training that she received in Medical School, and hoped that internship and residency would be more prevention oriented. That was not to be the case; nor was there much attention to the inherent ability of the human body to self-repair. “I kept waiting for the unit on how to optimize our regenerative capacity,” she writes, “but it never came. 95% of my training was about dealing with the symptoms of DEgeneration.”</p>
<p>Ultimately, Natalie took it upon herself to explore every facet of preventive care. Believing that was most likely to be found in Family Medicine (the most comprehensive specialty, covering everything from pediatrics to gerontology) she became board certified in 1999 and has maintained that prestigious position.</p>
<p>Even that, however, turned out to be disappointing. So she dove into the emerging science of anti-aging, and after more than 200 hours of research, became board certified in that specialty as well. </p>
<p>Still, she was not fulfilled. It was only by creating her own clinic in 2007 that she was able to finally practice the kind of medicine that she knew was possible. Advanced Family Wellness provides the full scope of primary medical care, with emphasis on prevention and anti-aging.  </p>

Moving to Los Angeles in 1980, he taught university clinical nutrition and directed the nation’s first federally licensed clinical lab specializing in nutrition and immunology. With a passion for sports nutrition, Stephen served on the faculty of the American College of Sports Medicine, and was nutritional consultant to members of the 1984 US Track and Field team.
Three years later, he moved to Santa Barbara to write. His first book, The DHEA Breakthrough (Random House, 1996) became an international best seller in 90 days. That was followed by Caffeine Blues (Warner, 1998) The Metabolic Plan (Random House 2003) and The Metabolic Makeover (Altea Media, 2014).  With more than one million copies in print, Stephen is one of the most widely read authors in the Health and Wellness category.  In 1998, Stephen co-founded Oasis Wellness Network / Univera. Over the next 19 years, serving first as President and then Chief Scientific Officer, his research team published 72 studies in peer-reviewed biomedical journals, created the world’s largest functional medicinal plant library and filed for more than 180 patents.
Dr. Natalie Kather took a less eclectic and more demanding path. Graduating with honors at every stage of her education, she received her Medical Degree in 1996. Natalie was disappointed at the “drugs first” training that she received in Medical School, and hoped that internship and residency would be more prevention oriented. That was not to be the case; nor was there much attention to the inherent ability of the human body to self-repair. “I kept waiting for the unit on how to optimize our regenerative capacity,” she writes, “but it never came. 95% of my training was about dealing with the symptoms of DEgeneration.”
Ultimately, Natalie took it upon herself to explore every facet of preventive care. Believing that was most likely to be found in Family Medicine (the most comprehensive specialty, covering everything from pediatrics to gerontology) she became board certified in 1999 and has maintained that prestigious position.
Even that, however, turned out to be disappointing. So she dove into the emerging science of anti-aging, and after more than 200 hours of research, became board certified in that specialty as well. 
Still, she was not fulfilled. It was only by creating her own clinic in 2007 that she was able to finally practice the kind of medicine that she knew was possible. Advanced Family Wellness provides the full scope of primary medical care, with emphasis on prevention and anti-aging.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>""<i>In its moving indictment of the misery wrought by war <strong>Across the Black Waters</strong> stands with Eric Maria Remarque’s <strong>All Quiet on the Western Front </strong>and Stephen Crane’s <strong>The Red Badge of Courage</strong>, as one of the best anti-war novels of all time.</i>""<br/>-- Professor Rajender Kaur, William Paterson University, New Jersey</p>
<p>We are excited to invite YOU<strong> </strong>to join us on our WWI Centenary Journey of Discovery<strong> </strong>into a world where fiction brings to life the story of over 1 million soldiers from Undivided India, Hindu, Muslim, Sikh and others who left their homes and families over five thousand miles away to fight for Britain with Allied forces in Europe for the first time.  Undivided India under colonial rule included present day Pakistan (1947), Bangladesh (1971) and India (1947).</p>
<p>Our project centres on the WWI Centenary edition of the novel <strong>Across the Black Waters</strong> by Mulk Raj Anand, which includes an Introduction by Dr Alastair Niven, friend of the author and Man Booker Prize Judge 1994 and 2014:</p>
<p><i>“It has taken nearly one hundred years for the contribution of Indian sepoys in the First World War to be properly recognised. Even today, it is less well known than it should be. Yet back in 1939 one of India’s greatest novelists, writing in English but forged by a Panjabi sensibility, described their bravery, suffering and bewilderment as they became cannon fodder in the trenches."" </i></p>
<p><strong>The 1st small print run of the WWI Centenary edition is fast running out.  We need your help to produce a 2nd version in larger numbers, with illustrations, that will help modern readers understand the context of the history behind the story.</strong></p>

<p>This is a story with huge relevance for today’s increasingly divided world.  Soldiers from very different communities and religions, including Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs, fought side by side within a shared culture for a common cause.</p>
<h3>Who We Are</h3>

We met and started to work together in London in 1993 and are now co-directors of Salt of the Sarkar, a project of  MánMelá Promotions Ltd.</p>
<p>We were inspired by the story told in the novel by Mulk Raj Anand (1905-2004) - the son of a soldier - about the very first Indian soldiers who arrived in Marseilles in September 1914 and fought in Flanders and France. From page one the characters come alive as we follow them arriving for the first time in Europe, and as they respond to the horrors of war they encounter.</p>
<p>We became the creative team behind Mán Melá Theatre Company and in 1998 we put on a theatre production of Across the Black Waters in 1998 with the author’s encouragement.  The launch, and also a one-day symposium were held at the Imperial War Museum. Mulk Raj Anand wrote to us that he would love to see his novel published in Britain again.</p>

<p>We were keen to see an edition produced which had Indian and not European soldiers on the front cover and we believed that the time for this to happen was October 2014, the centenary of the events in the novel.  </p>
<p>Against the odds we managed to launch a small printing of the novel together with our project Salt of the Sarkar at the House of Commons, London.</p>

<p><strong>Salt of the Sarkar</strong> is a project designed to promote the novel and the story behind it during the World War One Centenary years 2014-2018 and beyond. </p>
<p>The term 'Salt of the Sarkar' is used by the Indian soldiers in the novel Across the Black Waters as well as in their letters home.</p>
<p>""Sarkar"" means the ruling authority. ""Eating the salt"" refers to the oath that binds one to a political superior through obligations of protection and loyalty.</p>
<p>A key strand of our work is to broaden young people’s knowledge of the First World War and the contribution of  the soldiers from what was a culturally and religiously diverse India, but politically undivided prior to Partition in 1947.</p>
<p>Mulk Raj Anand’s novel and writing is also celebrated as a foundation stone of modern and post colonial writing.</p>
<p>We have no huge infrastructure or funding - just our passion, discoveries over the years. and the encouragement and support of a number of friends and supporters we have made along the way.</p>
<p>Our aim during the centenary years and beyond is to reach a new generation of over a million with the story and contribution of Undivided Indian soldiers in The Great War. We are doing this through the novel, soldiers letters home, events, workshops and sharing through social media.</p>
<h3><strong>Why this project is important to us</strong></h3>
<p>Mulk Raj Anand’s Across the Black Waters was first published simultaneously in London and Toronto in 1940. It is significant this still remains the only major fictional account of over a million soldiers from Undivided India who fought for the British Empire for the first time in Europe.  </p>
<p>We have personally both invested a huge amount of time, energy and resources into promoting this author and novel over more than two decades.  We are continually discovering more hidden depths relating to the author, the fiction and the relevant history that is behind the project.</p>
<p>Since starting our project in 2014 we have received a huge amount of support in kind from amazing friends to enable us to achieve our main objectives in publishing and promoting the novel to the level we have.</p>
<p>At the end of the day though we are basically two individuals working part time on this, based in two different countries - England and Wales - and we need financial support in order to take the project to the next level.</p>
<p>We believe that on many levels, this project has a message that is relevant to today’s divided and war torn world and deserves to be more widely known, especially by young people.</p>

They usually come ready-to-assemble with pre-colored pieces or stickers.</p><p>On the other hand, entertainment activities that a child experiences are mainly digital.

The Nativity Scene activity kit brings together maker principles (being inventive and learning through making) and cultural learning in a single activity.It depicts the birth of baby Jesus in a barn with Mary, Joseph and the three wise men. Made from Baltic birch plywood, this ready-to-paint scene comes with a sturdy base with grooved sidewalls for easy assembly. All the pieces are designed to fit together to create a 3-dimensional display. Paint and embellish the characters, animals and barn to display your artistic skills. Step-by-step instructions with detailed drawing are included in the kits.WHO IS THIS FOR?
Children that are interested in art and craft activities
Homeschooled children
Parents who want to teach children the value of making things with their hands
Parents who are interested in teaching children about significant cultural stories
Grandparents looking for a meaningful gift
WHAT’S IN THE ACTIVITY KIT?

 
WHY DOES YOUR CHILD NEED THIS?The Nativity Scene is based around a powerful cultural story that has universal recognition. Painting the scene gives your child the opportunity to add their personal expression and develop a strong association with the characters and elements.Mass produced play scenes offer very little room for the child’s artistic expression. They usually come ready-to-assemble with pre-colored pieces or stickers.On the other hand, entertainment activities that a child experiences are mainly digital. This does not give them the opportunity to work with tactile materials. Research has shown the act of making touchable, 3 dimensional objects with your own hands gives the child confidence and a sense of accomplishment that cannot be matched by a digital activity.WHAT IS THE MONEY FOR?The money raised through this campaign will go towards the purchase of a dedicated laser cutter. Right now, all the pieces are manufactured using equipment in a shared makerspace. Availability tends to be limited because of high demand forcing split production runs. This is not only inefficient but also increases quality control problems. Additionally, a dedicated laser cutter will assist in rapid prototyping and allow me to bring products to market faster. TIMELINEWeek starting 24 Oct – currently producing and accepting pre-ordersWeek starting 7 Nov – final packaging choicesWeek starting 28 Nov – kits ready to ship HELP SPREAD THE WORDYou are the key in helping change how your child learns.

<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>Hello! I'm Chris Wheeler Ayala, and I'm planning to travel to Korea this summer to join Yonsei University's Summer Abroad program through UCEAP.</p>
<p>I am Mexican American and both through travel and ultimately moving to the United States in 2011, have experienced the culture and day to day life of both of Mexico and the United States from a very young age.</p>
<p>Traveling to Korea would be a dream come true due to a great interest that first started with discovering the pop culture elements of Korean life such as k-pop, dramas, beauty, and of course, Korean food and BBQ! It has been quite a while since then and have developed more reasons and interest beyond that. I have taught myself the Korean Hangul alphabet and am continuously building on my vocabulary, and there is so much more that I'd like to learn, and what better way of doing that than by being in Korea?</p>
<p>I am looking forward to all the adventure that awaits me there - and hoping to see beautiful art and architecture to add to my Art History knowledge!</p>
<p>As a student that depends on Financial Aid to fund my studies, I had thought that studying/traveling abroad was out of my reach.

<h3>Our Mission and Cause</h3>
<p>With fifty-nine percent of the country living in poverty Bolivia stands as one of the poorest countries in Latin America. For the majority of Bolivians, living in such dire conditions restricts their access to educational resources, and in turn has led to low literacy rates through out the country.</p>
<p>Since we began establishing libraries in rural regions of Bolivia - the areas where education is most limited - we have seen an <strong>increase in literacy rates by 27%! </strong>In addition, high school graduation rates have lifted by 2% in areas where BiblioWorks has opened a library. Such outstanding improvements provide us with<strong> proof</strong> that we are <strong>succeeding at changing the face of literacy in rural regions of Bolivia!</strong></p>
<p>However, although we have done <strong>fantastic work </strong>over the years, there is still <strong>room to improve</strong>. This year we want to focus our efforts on updating and improving our first library ever built: La Biblioteca Villa Zamora in Morado K'asa.</p>
<p>Situated in the region of Tarabuco, our library in Morado K'asa has increased literacy rates by 22% since it was first opened it in 2005. While we are proud of its success, we also see areas where extra help could lead to further achievements! La Biblioteca Villa Zamora currently has a limited amount of basic resources such as children's books and educational materials that make promoting literacy very challenging. As the majority of children and families rely on the library in Morado K'asa as their sole provider for literacy tools and resources, it is our goal to ensure that they have access to the most updated and efficient library possible. So help us enable them to become successful learners and readers by making improvements on our library!</p>

<p>Hi! My name is Shirley Bond and I've been a flight attendant for almost thirty years. I'm also a semi-professional photographer and have always enjoyed writing poetry. I decided to put my three passions together and write a children's book to educate children and parents about traveling and safety onboard an airplane.  I took my own pictures to make it more realistic for kids to imagine what they will see up in the air and on their travels.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480024598/aytfpxgnbcydz9j8ypqs.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In the book, Bananas prepares children for their travel journey with tips about passports, packing, going through security and finally boarding an airplane. While onboard, he teaches them about everything from buckling up, to what they can expect when they flush the toilet up in the air :) </p>

<p>Along with reading and learning from the book, kids will be able to join Bananas' Club where there will be fun videos of Bananas' travels to watch, his very own song the kids will be able to sing along to, and so much more. Kids will also be invited to share photos from their own trips with Bananas and leave him messages. This is the first interactive travel &amp; safety book of its kind anywhere in the world and I'm so proud to share it with you. </p>

<h3>Why This Is So Important to Me</h3>
<p>Over the years as a flight attendant, I've seen it all -- nervous flyers, stressed parents, children being afraid to use the bathroom and so much more -- I could write a book just on that :) I want families to come onboard and feel safe and reassured, so there is no fear at all in their travel experiences. Up in the air, we become one family because we are all we have. I want my family to know everything they need to do to feel prepared before they go on a trip. I put together all the things I feel are important, like 20 great tips for parents, a safety demo with Bananas, and some other fun surprises that are in the works.</p>
<p>I also love children and music, so I co-wrote a song about my book called ""Up In The Air With Bananas"" -- the kids are going to love it! Come take this journey with us -- we can't wait to share it with you.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Help us bring the voices of LGBT+ champions into the American civil rights curriculum for middle school and high school classrooms everywhere! </p>
<p>When Eric Marcus created his award-winning book, Making History (1992) and its follow-up, Making Gay History (2002), he created a precious audio archive of the voices of 100 LGBT activists and champions, spanning the 1940s - 1990s. Fortunately, what Eric captured is a record of the sacrifices and championship for one of the greatest American civil rights movements. </p>
<p>Now, Eric Marcus and Sara Burningham have begun the production of ""<a href=""http://makinggayhistory.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Making Gay History: The Podcast</a>,"" with <strong><a href=""https://unerased.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">History UnErased</a></strong> as its education partner. As a team, we are launching the <strong>Give Voice to History </strong>project - an LGBT+ academic content series for middle schools and high schools. The series will be freakin' amazing (details below) and FREE for all teachers and students. Everywhere. </p>

<p>The Arcus Foundation has granted $45,000 to support the first 10 voices of ""Making Gay History: The Podcast."" <strong>We need your donation</strong> to make sure that these voices are heard in middle school and high school classrooms. Each ""voice"" needs:</p>

<p>Including LGBT+ history in K-12 classrooms is an idea that can be frightening and mysterious. Most people have never had the opportunity to engage with LGBT+ topics through an academic lens, so introducing this content with personal stories from Eric’s audio archive has the power to dispel myths and misperceptions and shape a richer, more honest historical narrative.

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">A NEW APPROACH TO EDUCATION</span></h3> <p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We are opening a new school that aims to redefine learning for Louisville students. Stonecote Sudbury School is based on the educational model of the Sudbury Valley School, founded in 1968 in Framingham, Massachusetts. The fundamental difference between learning at Stonecote and being taught at traditional schools is the level of responsibility students have in their own education. The school will be led by a participatory democracy, the School Meeting, consisting of all enrolled students and staff members. The curriculum is student-led, following the philosophy that motivation follows interest. Stonecote will be the first school in Louisville to follow the Sudbury model of education. The facility is located on a landmark estate at 1005 Alta Vista Road in the heart of Louisville.</span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Our Founders have been working diligently to open Stonecote this fall. We have received tremendous support from the community, including the pro bono work of a local real estate attorney, tax attorney, film-maker, photographer, and a leading financial consultant. Now we are asking for the help of family, friends, parents, students, anyone who has ever been involved in Sudbury education, and anyone who supports educational freedom for children. Your donation will help build the foundation of this new school.</span></p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;background-color: initial;"">WHAT MAKES STONECOTE SUDBURY SCHOOL DIFFERENT?</span></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Stonecote Sudbury School’s instructional philosophy is largely based on the Sudbury model of education<span style=""background-color: initial;"">. The fundamental premises, as </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">defined by Sudbury Valley’s publication <i><a href=""http://bookstore.sudburyvalley.org/product/kingdom-childhood"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kingdom of Childhood</a></i>, are as follows: </span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul><li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">“that all people are curious by nature; </span></li></ul>
<ul><li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">that the most efficient, long lasting, and profound learning takes place when started and pursued by the learner; </span></li></ul>
<ul><li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">that all people are creative if they are allowed to develop their unique talents; </span></li></ul>
<ul><li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">that age-mixing among students </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">promotes growth in all members of the group;</span>
</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">and that freedom is essential to the development of personal </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">responsibility.”</span>
</li></ul>
<p>Stonecote Sudbury School is led by the School Meeting; a participatory democracy consisting of all enrolled <span style=""background-color: initial;"">students and staff members. Each School Meeting member has an equal vote on all concerns. The School Meeting </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">occurs weekly and is responsible for all areas of school governance, e.g., instituting school rules, hiring requisite </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">staff, determining annual budget, maintaining the school building and grounds, and establishing Clerkships, </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Committees, and School Corporations.</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">At Stonecote, we begin with the assertion that learning arises from within the student. Passionate interest ignites intrinsic motivation, leading a student to pursue activities, knowledge, skill, and achievements based solely on personal interest and initiative, rather than on the external motivation of earning a reward or avoiding a punishment. The byproducts of such focused pursuits are habits of ingenuity, passion, persistence, and confidence.<br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1467676244/FullSizeRender_lz3b0u.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Because Stonecote is governed by the School Meeting, a broad range of students and staff is essential to life within the school.  The more diversity present in the members of School Meeting, the richer the discussions surrounding each topic of debate. A participatory democracy thrives on a variety of voices and opinions. The School needs all kinds of students and staff members to give voice to the diverse needs of the school community, and the community outside the school as well.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p>The curriculum and instruction at Stonecote Sudbury School are also enriched by an increase in student and staff diversity. Students create their own day and follow their interests toward their desired outcomes. A more diverse student population will increase the potential for student exposure to a broad range of interests.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The School’s chosen curriculum, rather than being a tiny subset of skills and knowledge, is divergent, open-ended, and as infinite in variety as the students are. Through observation and experimentation, students test a variety of ideas and behaviors to discover what works and what doesn’t work for them. Adults and other students provide vital examples and possibilities, offer organic feedback as friends and equals, and allow for opportunities to consolidate growth through sharing information, conversation, and experience.</p>
<p>The main goal for the students is to gather the skills they need to become successful adults. These skills are naturally learned through play, self-selected study, conversation, and practical experience in a participatory democracy.</p>
<p>A secondary goal for the students is to become empowered by the School’s structure, governance, and culture. <span>Students are free to pursue self-chosen challenges and opportunities; and through their experiences, they develop new competence and become increasingly self-reliant within a community of support.</span></p>
<p></p>

Now we are asking for the help of family, friends, parents, students, anyone who has ever been involved in Sudbury education, and anyone who supports educational freedom for children. Your donation will help build the foundation of this new school.
WHAT MAKES STONECOTE SUDBURY SCHOOL DIFFERENT?

Stonecote Sudbury School’s instructional philosophy is largely based on the Sudbury model of education. The fundamental premises, as defined by Sudbury Valley’s publication Kingdom of Childhood, are as follows: 


“that all people are curious by nature; 
that the most efficient, long lasting, and profound learning takes place when started and pursued by the learner; 
that all people are creative if they are allowed to develop their unique talents; 

that age-mixing among students promotes growth in all members of the group;


and that freedom is essential to the development of personal responsibility.”

Stonecote Sudbury School is led by the School Meeting; a participatory democracy consisting of all enrolled students and staff members. Each School Meeting member has an equal vote on all concerns. The School Meeting occurs weekly and is responsible for all areas of school governance, e.g., instituting school rules, hiring requisite staff, determining annual budget, maintaining the school building and grounds, and establishing Clerkships, Committees, and School Corporations.
At Stonecote, we begin with the assertion that learning arises from within the student. Passionate interest ignites intrinsic motivation, leading a student to pursue activities, knowledge, skill, and achievements based solely on personal interest and initiative, rather than on the external motivation of earning a reward or avoiding a punishment. The byproducts of such focused pursuits are habits of ingenuity, passion, persistence, and confidence.



Because Stonecote is governed by the School Meeting, a broad range of students and staff is essential to life within the school.  The more diversity present in the members of School Meeting, the richer the discussions surrounding each topic of debate. A participatory democracy thrives on a variety of voices and opinions. The School needs all kinds of students and staff members to give voice to the diverse needs of the school community, and the community outside the school as well.

The curriculum and instruction at Stonecote Sudbury School are also enriched by an increase in student and staff diversity. Students create their own day and follow their interests toward their desired outcomes. A more diverse student population will increase the potential for student exposure to a broad range of interests.

The School’s chosen curriculum, rather than being a tiny subset of skills and knowledge, is divergent, open-ended, and as infinite in variety as the students are. Through observation and experimentation, students test a variety of ideas and behaviors to discover what works and what doesn’t work for them. Adults and other students provide vital examples and possibilities, offer organic feedback as friends and equals, and allow for opportunities to consolidate growth through sharing information, conversation, and experience.
The main goal for the students is to gather the skills they need to become successful adults. These skills are naturally learned through play, self-selected study, conversation, and practical experience in a participatory democracy.
A secondary goal for the students is to become empowered by the School’s structure, governance, and culture. Students are free to pursue self-chosen challenges and opportunities; and through their experiences, they develop new competence and become increasingly self-reliant within a community of support.


WHAT WE NEED: Our goal of $95,000 will help provide the following:


Financial aid for families in need
Necessary technology and equipment for the students 

Modifications to the property pursuant to code to effectively change the use of the building from residential to educational 

A reserve fund for the school's debt service, unforeseen repairs, and operating expenses 
Redesigning learning spaces according to student interest and Stonecote's unique approach to educational freedom and responsibility

The guarantee that a Stonecote education becomes a reality for the children of Louisville, surrounding counties, and Southern Indiana.

If you want to honor our inaugural year, 2016, a $2,016 gift is the perk level for you! To thank you for your gift, our artists will create a Giving Tree decoration of your choosing! Your name will be emblazoned on your design, and our heartfelt thanks go out to you.


To complement The Stonecote Giving Tree, we will have a page on our website, which will serve as our digital donor tree. To all donors who wish to remain anonymous, your wish will be respected with gratitude. 


Beyond The Giving Tree

For a gift of $5,000, you will be honored by having a room named by you for a period of five years. In order to meet the needs of the students, each room within Stonecote Estate will have redesigned elements. Your gift will make those improvements possible, and the room will bear your name, or the name of a person of your choice, as a monumental Thank You!

At the $10,200 level, your contribution will help a student attend Stonecote Sudbury School who otherwise couldn't. This amount is equivalent to one year's tuition at Stonecote. Donors at this level will receive our tremendous thanks, and will have a scholarship fund named in their honor, or in honor of a person of their choice. 


To all of our supporters, You are helping bring this school into reality! You are creating educational freedom for students in Louisville and beyond, and you have our thanks!



THE IMPACT OF A STONECOTE EDUCATION


Children across the country are giving indicators that their needs are not being met within the world of traditional education. These indicators are becoming more and more pronounced each year. They are evidenced by the dramatic increase in childhood mental health diagnosis. To follow are some staggering statistics as cited in the film, “Schooling the World.” 







16,000,000 U.S. Children suffer from depression and other emotional problems
1,600,000 are currently on 2 or more psychiatric drugs
69,000 girls between 13 and 19 regularly cut themselves
120,000 children have tried to kill themselves in the past 12 months

Additionally, there are many other children who may be thriving academically by common societal measures, but who are exhibiting less obvious, though no less damaging, consequences of a traditional education, e.g., disinterest in learning; general disengagement; loss of wonder; loss of creativity and critical thinking skills; extreme fear of making mistakes; and loss of self. In analysis of conventional education and its present trends, these are profound indicators that signal, culturally, society’s readiness for a change.
The needs and opportunities for learning have changed immensely since the onset of standardized education in the Industrial Age. Critical thinking, creativity, self-initiative, collaboration, effective communication, and technological literacy are absolute necessities in today's world. The adverse effects of our outdated model of education are presenting themselves in greater intensity each day, and educational professionals and psychologists are researching and writing about these issues and what can be done to solve them in abundance. 
The solution Stonecote Sudbury School is offering is to be an educational environment where students are not forced into the box of traditional education, but are free to explore their world and to discover their unique interests, talents, and needs, as well as how to utilize those traits to be successful as adults.
According to extensive studies of Sudbury graduates, alumni excel in customary measures of success; 87% of graduates go on to college, and an astounding 42% are involved in entrepreneurial pursuits. But most importantly, graduates indicate that they see themselves as confident and adept members of society, capable of defining meaningful goals for their lives and finding ways to achieve them.

What Is VIBE

VIBE breaks through the loud environment of a job-site by using a vibration to get a person’s attention.  VIBE is a wireless, compact, and completely self-contained unit which requires no external equipment to make it function.  The entire VIBE unit fits comfortably in or on your hard-hat or helmet, keeping it hidden and out of the way.

 Whether you are using loud equipment, working out of a bucket, running a machine, or working in any indoor or outdoor situation, VIBE gets the immediate attention of your crew allowing them to stop what they are doing and make eye contact, creating a more relaxed work environment. 

VIBE takes into account all of the rigors and potential hazards caused by ineffective communication.


With VIBE there is no longer a need for ineffective yelling, wild hand motions or dangerous situations caused by trying to get your worker’s attention. 



Where We Are Now

VIBE has been in use by us and the crew for two years and has proven to be invaluable in our daily work.  Beta testing has started and the response from our testers has been more than encouraging.  

We have come a long way and have gone through some easy times and rough times but all good times.  
We have our patent, three generations of prototypes, beta tests in place and significant contacts but we still have a long way to go and with your help we can see our units provide a safer and more stress free work environment for anyone who can benefit from better communication.


Our Needs

Since our first prototype was created we have, for the most part, funded VIBE ourselves .  We have also received help from generous friends and family to meet some of our financial needs.  The costs associated with establishing a new product is substantial and we sincerely appreciate any help you can give.
Some of the substantial costs are:

The dollar amount we are requesting will be able to take care of all these costs and allow us to bring VIBE to market.

<h3>Think back to your elementary school days...
</h3>
<p>What did you love about them? What did you hate? What made it great? What could have made it better?</p>
<h3>Now imagine a day as a student at The Little Red Schoolhouse.....</h3>
<p>
</p>You arrive at The Little Red Schoolhouse by bus at 8:00 in the morning.  Upon arrival, you head into the cafeteria to eat a hot breakfast that was made for you by a loving cafeteria lady.  Once you are finished with breakfast, you head down to your classroom.  There in your classroom is your teacher and 3-5 other students ready to learn.  You and your classmates spend the morning learning math, science, social studies, and reading.  You love school and you love learning because you are learning at your own level and at your own pace.  You aren't as good at reading so you are using an iPad to practice some important reading skills you missed from previous grades.  Your classmate is an excellent reader so she is in the reading loft reading a book from her favorite series while petting the classroom cat.  You are above grade level in math so during math class you are working with the teacher to learn skills that are two grade levels ahead.  Some of your classmates are just learning their multiplication facts, but you mastered those over a year ago so you practice 3 digit times 3 digit multiplication.  Before you know it, it's lunchtime!  After your lunch with your teacher and friends, your afternoon at ""school"" is filled with play time and enrichment activities. You can take lessons in dance, piano, karate, violin, cheer, banjo, singing, etc. During recess, you learn how to get along with others while playing.  While participating in an organized sports activity, you learn the rules of the game along with good sportsmanship.  Now your school day is over and it's time to go home.  You can't wait to come back again tomorrow.<br/><h3>Ages 3-4 years...</h3>
<p>Our 3-4 year old preschool program will have no more than 5 kids in it.  The young kids in this class will explore learning thru play, exposure to books and nursery rhymes, and learning games.  We believe if we can create these experiences early on, these lower income kids will start kindergarten ready to go.<br/></p>
<h3>Kindergarten...</h3>
<div>Our kindergarten students will continue to learn thru play.  They will learn their letters and numbers and begin to learn to read and do math.  If they need more than a school year to master kindergarten skills, they may spend more than a year there.  They will not be pushed on just because the school year is up. Our kindergarten class will have approximately 5 students in it.</div>
<h3>Grades 1-8...</h3>
<div>These grades will be multiage grades 1 &amp; 2, 3 &amp; 4, 5 &amp; 6, 7 &amp; 8.  Each multiage classroom would have about 6 students. Teachers in these grades will give students individualized instruction according to what skill level they are on.  As necessary, students may advance or remain in a grade level.  This will be determined based on the child's ability level. </div>
<h3>Beyond 8th Grade....</h3>
<div>Our goal at The Little Red Schoolhouse is to help underprivileged/lower income students have an individualized school experience that will enable them to have a successful future.  We aim to prepare and equip our students to be on a level playing field with their peers by the time they enter their local high school.</div>
<h3>Adult/Parent Education and Support Classroom....</h3>
<div>We feel that the parent to our kids here is the most influential person in their child's life.  Therefore, we understand how important it is to equip those parents with beneficial skills.  At The Little Red Schoolhouse, we will offer help to the parent with an adult classroom.  This classroom will be equipped with a teacher that will provide educational help so the parent can become more able to help their own child.

<h3>This IS a focused private school for select underprivileged/lower income kids.</h3>
<p> I plan to open a very small school for ages 3 years to 8th grade 
that will focus on educating underprivileged kids in my local area. 

Every year I see those students at my school who need a little more 
individualized help.  Students who may not get support at home because 
mom and dad just don't have enough education of their own to feel 
confident to help. Most of these kids don't have someone who can home 
school them and no one is going to send them to private school, or pay 
for a tutor. Students will attend without having to pay tuition.</p>
<h3>This IS NOT anti public school.<br/>
</h3>
<p> I love my job and the school district in which I work. I am frustrated with federal and state government control over programs, teacher evaluations, and testing requirements. These decisions are made by many who have never taught in the classroom or who have been out of the classroom for a long time.  There are many great things that happen in public schools and many fabulous teachers there making it happen.  All 3 of my kids attend their local public school and are thriving there. This school is meant to take a few students from public school who need a little more time, love, and attention and help them thrive.  Our goal is to have them ready to return to their local high school at an equal or higher level than their peers and with the skills and confidence to achieve there.</p>

Think back to your elementary school days...

What did you love about them? What did you hate? What made it great? What could have made it better?
Now imagine a day as a student at The Little Red Schoolhouse.....

You arrive at The Little Red Schoolhouse by bus at 8:00 in the morning.  Upon arrival, you head into the cafeteria to eat a hot breakfast that was made for you by a loving cafeteria lady.  Once you are finished with breakfast, you head down to your classroom.  There in your classroom is your teacher and 3-5 other students ready to learn.  You and your classmates spend the morning learning math, science, social studies, and reading.  You love school and you love learning because you are learning at your own level and at your own pace.  You aren't as good at reading so you are using an iPad to practice some important reading skills you missed from previous grades.  Your classmate is an excellent reader so she is in the reading loft reading a book from her favorite series while petting the classroom cat.  You are above grade level in math so during math class you are working with the teacher to learn skills that are two grade levels ahead.  Some of your classmates are just learning their multiplication facts, but you mastered those over a year ago so you practice 3 digit times 3 digit multiplication.  Before you know it, it's lunchtime!  After your lunch with your teacher and friends, your afternoon at ""school"" is filled with play time and enrichment activities. You can take lessons in dance, piano, karate, violin, cheer, banjo, singing, etc. During recess, you learn how to get along with others while playing.  While participating in an organized sports activity, you learn the rules of the game along with good sportsmanship.  Now your school day is over and it's time to go home.  You can't wait to come back again tomorrow.Ages 3-4 years...
Our 3-4 year old preschool program will have no more than 5 kids in it.  The young kids in this class will explore learning thru play, exposure to books and nursery rhymes, and learning games.  We believe if we can create these experiences early on, these lower income kids will start kindergarten ready to go.
Kindergarten...
Our kindergarten students will continue to learn thru play.  They will learn their letters and numbers and begin to learn to read and do math.  If they need more than a school year to master kindergarten skills, they may spend more than a year there.  They will not be pushed on just because the school year is up. Our kindergarten class will have approximately 5 students in it.
Grades 1-8...
These grades will be multiage grades 1 & 2, 3 & 4, 5 & 6, 7 & 8.  Each multiage classroom would have about 6 students. Teachers in these grades will give students individualized instruction according to what skill level they are on.  As necessary, students may advance or remain in a grade level.  This will be determined based on the child's ability level. 
Beyond 8th Grade....
Our goal at The Little Red Schoolhouse is to help underprivileged/lower income students have an individualized school experience that will enable them to have a successful future.  We aim to prepare and equip our students to be on a level playing field with their peers by the time they enter their local high school.
Adult/Parent Education and Support Classroom....
We feel that the parent to our kids here is the most influential person in their child's life.  Therefore, we understand how important it is to equip those parents with beneficial skills.  At The Little Red Schoolhouse, we will offer help to the parent with an adult classroom.  This classroom will be equipped with a teacher that will provide educational help so the parent can become more able to help their own child. We will offer parenting classes, opportunities for parents to fill in their own educational gaps, time and resources for them to further their own education, and direction on how to help their child at home.  We will also provide social service opportunities to them that will help their family.  

This IS a focused private school for select underprivileged/lower income kids.
 I plan to open a very small school for ages 3 years to 8th grade 
that will focus on educating underprivileged kids in my local area. 

Every year I see those students at my school who need a little more 
individualized help.  Students who may not get support at home because 
mom and dad just don't have enough education of their own to feel 
confident to help. Most of these kids don't have someone who can home 
school them and no one is going to send them to private school, or pay 
for a tutor. Students will attend without having to pay tuition.
This IS NOT anti public school.

 I love my job and the school district in which I work. I am frustrated with federal and state government control over programs, teacher evaluations, and testing requirements. These decisions are made by many who have never taught in the classroom or who have been out of the classroom for a long time.  There are many great things that happen in public schools and many fabulous teachers there making it happen.  All 3 of my kids attend their local public school and are thriving there. This school is meant to take a few students from public school who need a little more time, love, and attention and help them thrive.  Our goal is to have them ready to return to their local high school at an equal or higher level than their peers and with the skills and confidence to achieve there.

The Impact

 With your help, we can make a difference in a child's life.   Giving these kids an advantage like this is priceless.  
Helping our little school focus on these handful of kids will change their lives forever. Wouldn't you have loved attending a school like this as a child?

Scroll down to Perks. You won’t be disappointed.Meet the TeamBrian Magill:  Brian has been playing and teaching guitar for over thirty years. He helped set up the website 3lmusic.com, which is designed to teach complete beginners to play either the Tin whistle or the flute. Having come up with the idea to add a beginner’s course on the guitar for visually impaired students, he is focused on seeing this project through to completion.  Sean Creaven:  Based in Dublin, Sean has a background in health care, having worked as a mental health nurse for 28 years. He is Dad to 2 wannabe musical sons, and sings with his local community gospel choir. He is now in charge of the thankless job of admin for this project.We would also like to give a special thank you to the following people who have freely given their time to help us set up this campaign. Ray Fallon, Mike from Sligeach Films, Ben at bensound.com for the background music, Nikki and Nessa. 2cMusic is the name of this campaign, which is being run by us here at 3lmusic.com.          Although based in Ireland, this is truly an international project with a strong social aspect.Why we are running this CampaignOn a short bus journey this summer in Dublin, Brian, one of the owners of the website 3lmusic.com, sat beside a young lady, they began to talk, and It turned out that she was a tourist from the UK, visiting relatives with a friend for a few days.During the conversation she asked him what he worked at, he explained that he ran a website which teaches people to play musical instruments online, and he jokingly said she should sign up for one of the online courses.She simply answered by saying that she would really love to but couldn’t as she was blind and had never learned “Music Braille”, the equivalent of learning music theory in order to read sheet music. It being a sunny day and with her wearing sunglasses he had never noticed.  Most sighted musicians cannot read sheet music and rely on very simple method of reading chord diagrams and tablature in order to learn to play the guitar, for example. Shown above on the right, tablature or TAB as it is referred to, shows the six strings of the guitar. On these strings are numbers which tell a student which fret to place their finger on. This is not a system which is readily available to visually impaired people.  We can honestly say that when we initially set up our website it had never even crossed our minds about the problems visually impaired people encounter when accessing almost every website site, things the rest of us simply take for granted.Since that chance meeting on the bus, we have spent a lot of time investigating the possibility of producing a course which can be used by any visually impaired person with no previous musical knowledge.Imagine for a moment the way a sighted student learns from a music site at present. They choose a video, for example how to learn the C Chord on the Guitar. This is a simple enough process. They simply follow the information on the video which is a combination of audio, text and images.For a visually impaired person at present who cant read Music Braille, it is only the audio portion of the lesson they have to follow.

<li>  I'm Yusuf Mohamed from Egypt. I'm an artist who graduated from the High Institute of Cinema in 2015 with a bachelor degree in cinematography. I have also had a bachelor degree in educational art since 2010.</li>
<li>  I have a dream to study in one of the most important cinematography schools in the world - until now I have managed to achieve a part of my dream – I want to have a master's degree from Lodz Film School in Poland. It's a five-year-long master’s course. After a year of learning the Polish language in Poland under the care of the school, starting the 1st of October I'll be studying practically.</li>
<li>  I tried to find some fund or scholarship to continue my studies but without success. That’s because most scholarships are for science not art (especially cinema!!)</li>
<li>  The main obstacle is that I have to pay 11,000 euro per year for my studies. This course takes 5 years. For now, I only have 3600 euros and that is due to the economic conditions in Egypt. Especially after the flotation of the Egyptian currency. It decreased from 7300 euro to 3600 euro. If I can’t solve this problem, I won’t be able to continue my studies and I'll be forced to return to my country because I literally sold everything I had (including my car).</li>
<li>  The currency of Egyptian pound in 30th of May 2016 was 1 euro = 9,88 Egyptian pounds and now it's 1 euro = 21,23 Egyptian pounds!!!</li>
<li>  I had around 76000 Egyptian pounds which should make 7700 euro. Because of the floating in the Egyptian pound it decreased to 3600!! I didn't exchange the money before going to Poland to study Polish because no one thought such floating will happen.</li>
<li>  I hope I will be able to follow and achieve my dream. I believe in knowledge and learning. I'm the first Egyptian in the whole history of the school (which was open in 1948!)</li>
<li>  Achieving my goal means that nothing is impossible,</li>
<li>  The main reason I’m asking you to join me on my journey is that I have already taken my steps and I can’t stop now!</li>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Survive the New World</h2>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">I struggled, but you don't have to</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>If you believe me, you will be rewarded. If you don't believe me, I will make it worth your while to change your mind. Let me explain.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When the entire world runs on tech, programming is high in demand. Every business has a website, shops go online, games are popular and smart devices need custom apps to function.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I've been introduced to programming in my early teenage years. I followed many tutorials, but struggled to learn because I kept falling into the same trap; the same one that stops you from learning a foreign language. You can repeat premade sentences many times and understand them well, but when you need to say something else you fall flat. One solution is to start learning everything, eventually connecting the dots and understanding how to read, write and speak. However, you don't have the time for that. And where would you even start?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In programming, I had the same experience. I followed the code-along tutorials on the internet, but I was lost when working on my own. I spent so much time on programming that eventually I learned it and could write my own apps. Entering university, I was well ahead on everyone else so I could just focus on the theory and algorithms. As a bonus, I had a job as a programmer to pay my tuition fees.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I finished my education but it didn’t feel right. The knowledge I gained was mainly from my job and other personal projects. What was learned in school felt almost useless. Some of you who were in university are probably not surprised.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Even if you don't become a programmer, there are hidden benefits. I personally made apps to help me study, avoided a lot of manual work, calculated complex probabilities and made many tools for myself. Not to mention that programming teaches you how to deconstruct problems and organize your thoughts. Do it for your brain!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So how do you learn programming efficiently? From my experience as both a self-learner and student, you need to learn three things: the fundamentals of programming, the ability to search online, and the techniques to find bugs in your code because you will waste several hours on them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am making a course that is effective for both adults and teenagers. A course divided in small chunks for busy people but also fun and interactive for better understanding. The goal is to get you from a total beginner to a university level coder.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I will show you how to tackle problems and think on your own. How to learn what you need for your own projects and how to find those annoying bugs quickly. And on top of that, I will teach you the fundamental algorithms of Computer Science.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But instead of telling you how great it will be, I would rather show you. You can try my first demo lesson. My hope is that you will see how far this project can go. Follow the link and give it a try: <a href=""https://codefarmonline.com/lessons/intro/lesson1/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://codefarmonline.com/lessons/intro/lesson1/</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>As I build the course, I am asking for a $50 or more donation to get complete access for life. When the first version is completed, I will release it, but I will keep improving every lesson until I am satisfied with the result.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When completed, this course will be sold for up to $500, so get in now for $50! I will even give you the option to change your mind. When this campaign ends, there will be a 30-day grace period to get your money back if you are unhappy with your investment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For a course that aims to replace university, I am comfortable with this project.</p>

So how do you learn programming efficiently? From my experience as both a self-learner and student, you need to learn three things: the fundamentals of programming, the ability to search online, and the techniques to find bugs in your code because you will waste several hours on them.
 
I am making a course that is effective for both adults and teenagers. A course divided in small chunks for busy people but also fun and interactive for better understanding. The goal is to get you from a total beginner to a university level coder.
 
I will show you how to tackle problems and think on your own. How to learn what you need for your own projects and how to find those annoying bugs quickly. And on top of that, I will teach you the fundamental algorithms of Computer Science.
 
But instead of telling you how great it will be, I would rather show you. You can try my first demo lesson. My hope is that you will see how far this project can go. Follow the link and give it a try: https://codefarmonline.com/lessons/intro/lesson1/
 
As I build the course, I am asking for a $50 or more donation to get complete access for life. When the first version is completed, I will release it, but I will keep improving every lesson until I am satisfied with the result.
 
When completed, this course will be sold for up to $500, so get in now for $50! I will even give you the option to change your mind. When this campaign ends, there will be a 30-day grace period to get your money back if you are unhappy with your investment.
 
For a course that aims to replace university, I am comfortable with this project.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“Jumped” means beat-up by 25 other
peers. The youths said, “They deserved to be kicked in their face and head,” cause
they always in people’s business. Read more below... Oh, what a
frightening world we live in!</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Solid
Rock Enterprise, Inc. passion to “EMPOWER &amp; EQUIP THE CHILDREN &amp;
YOUTH became more vivid after I, Arnetha Thomas/CEO, made the decision to
retired in 2005 to devote full-time work in making a difference in the
lives of student victims; teaching students about the juvenile justice
system; and how to avoid becoming entangled. This work began without funding of
any source, serving in Brownsville Middle urban school. The project later
received a small grant and more grants that expanded services in
helping to date over 1500 victim, delinquent, and disadvantage students
and families. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We intervene
in bullying situations, peacefully resolve school &amp; community
fights, rumors, disruptive classroom behaviors, stealing, graffiti, academic
failure, and more. Currently, we provide limited program services, due to the
lack of funding. Project utilizes graduate and undergraduate Social
Work Interns. My background includes expertise in conflict resolution and
reconciliation, program management, training, crisis intervention, and more. Administration and supported staff are trained experts in conflict resolution and reconciliation. Their experience also includes serving student victims, disadvantage youths, and families. The Board of Directors is comprised of professional to youth advocate of
diverse disciplines.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The
ability to empower and equip the children and youth is very
important to Solid Rock, the team, collaborative partners, and other stakeholders.  Unfortunately, fighting has become a way of life,  escalating to little and no empathy for their peers; “Jumped” by 25 other youths. The teens said,
“They deserved to be kicked in their face and head, cause they always in
people’s business."" The question was asked, “even if they died?’ The response
was “Yes.” Oh, what a frightening world we live in! So, this is the driving force motivating us to help rid the violence. These youngsters
must internalize and understand life has more to offer in positive ways.<br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">To
help Solid Rock in this initiative, I, Arnetha Thomas/CEO have published a
children’s and Christian book titled: Beautiful As A Butterfly (hardcover), for
young and elementary age children. This book teaches responsibility, decision
making, and tells the child why they are beautiful as a butterfly. Beautiful As
A Butterfly retails for $24.99, but sale price $19.00. This includes shipping and tax. The Power of the Blood
at Work-Broken Veil (paperback) is for young to seasoned adults; and provides
spiritual, professional, and self-help development. Workbook included in the
back. This book retails for $14.95, but sale price $9.00. This includes shipping and tax. Other ways to support this
campaign is through personal contributions of any amount, such as $1 -
$5. We will accept more. We’re also asking that you share this campaign
with your family, friends, associates, business partners, social media friends,
and church members/affiliates. At the end of this campaign from March 15-31, 2015, Beautiful As A Butterfly ebook and Power of the Blood at Work Broken Veil ebook will be available for $1.00 each.

</div><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><div>
</div><h3>
</h3><div>
</div><p style=""text-align: justify;"">
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">To
introduce and sustain empathy, children/youth must learn how to get along. They
must understand “TRADING PLACES” means pretending to be their peer and their
peer pretending to be them to understand each others feelings; then to respect
themselves and others. The empathy curriculum is based on Restorative Justice,
Kingian Nonviolence, and mediation all evidence based models or best practices.
The participant’s real life, day to day experiences that include rumors,
ranking, bullying, fighting, and not being soft will be used to successfully
engage their participation and internalize the importance of empathy. This
initiative also helps to build and mend relationships. The targeted 200 participants
will initially receive 12 hours of training by April 2015; and an additional 8 training hours throughout the 10-12 month period. During the initial phase they
will be certified as Peer Circle Gatekeepers (Facilitators). They will be responsible for facilitating circles with their peers to help them understand the importance of empathy and to put what they learned into practice. The Gatekeepers will participate in empathy  projects and benefit from cultural/educational field trips. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
</p><p>We need $120,000 to support the “Trading Places” Kids
Helping Kids-Empathy Project. As the founder/CEO, my credentials include
Master’s in Social Work, National Restorative Justice, Kingian Nonviolence, and
Peer Mediation Trainer; and Family Mediator. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>The CEO will receive $50,000 to continue
overseeing and serving victim and disadvantage students and families in the
Restorative Justice Academy; oversee the Empathy Project; train and serve as
the lead facilitator in the workshops/training; provide the curriculum that’s
evidence based or best practices; and help publish the “Optimal Peer
Mediation"" book. </p></li>
<li><p>$46, 000 will support two (2) 30 hours per/week staff that will preferably have a Bachelor’s degree in Social Work or related field. This staff will work with the training initiative, serving the targeted 200 disadvantage children and youth for a period of 10-12 months; along with support from the board, team, collaborative partners, other stakeholders, and trained volunteers. </p></li>
<li><p>$20,000 will be used for advertisement that
includes social networks, radio, television, and flyer dissemination for
sustainability and expansion of Solid Rock’s initiatives that include the Empathy project. </p></li>
<li><p>$4,000 will support cultural and educational
field trips.</p></li>
</ol>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Again for helping us, at the end of this campaign from March 15-31, 2015, Beautiful As A Butterfly ebook and Power of the Blood at Work Broken Veil ebook will be available for $1.00 each.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In
case we fail to receive all of the funding requested, Solid Rock is in the
process of requesting financial contributions and sponsorship from the
Children’s Trust, Miami Dade County, Longshoreman’s Association, Florida
Department of Juvenile Justice, Publix’s, Pizza Hut, churches and more. The
Empathy Project will continue as our primary focus. If we must, the number of
trained participants may be reduced by 25-100 participants. The CEO is
expected to receive approximately 25% of these funds to support the training,
curriculum, and curriculum tools. Instead of hiring 2 staff may hire only one. Will have to rely more on volunteers. The youth will continue to participate in projects, but field trips maybe reduced.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Never-the-less, we believe the Empathy Project Campaign will exceed our funding expectations. If so, we look forward to expanding this initiative.

</div><h3>The Impact</h3><div> </div><p>
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">""Bullying is everyone’s concern,"" says the Center for Disease Control (2009). Everyone
should care about the Empathy Project, because we all have been hurt directly
or indirectly by the epidemic in youth violence to include: homicide, injuries,
bullying, and fighting behaviors among our school age children/youth.  Research
shows crime and violence tend to be high in areas in which at least 20% of the
residents are poor. See the poverty and economic chart below.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1127466/files/20150102101740-povertyeconomicstatua.png?1420222660"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/02/civil-rights-act-anniversary-racism-charts_n_5521104.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a></p>
<p align=""justify"">
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">This Empathy Project will primarily
target the Brownsville and surrounding communities. Brownsville
(33142) ranks as one of the poorest neighborhoods in the nation (U.S.
Census, 2010). Poverty is associated to violence. According to Goldstein and
Glick (1987), children and youth are de-sensitized to the daily community
violence of fighting and deaths resulting from drive by shootings and stray
bullets. Further indicated, “results of deficiencies in emotional
self-regulation caused by excessive exposure to social, family, and individual
risks lead to participation in delinquency activities, verbal, physical
aggression, victimization, and the internalization of antisocial value system. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">On
a national level, gun violence is the second leading cause of death for children
ages 1-19, but the leading cause of death for black American children
(Children’s Defense Fund, 2010). Black children and teens are twice as likely
to be killed by guns as by cars; the report notes, while white children and
teens are nearly three times more likely to die in car accidents instead of gun
violence. Then 30% of U.S. students in grades 6<sup>th</sup> -10<sup>th</sup>
are involved in moderate or frequent bullying as the bully, victim, or both. 8%
of students miss 1 day of class per month for fear of bullies (Department of
Health &amp; Human Services; Center for Disease Control &amp; Prevention; Safe
&amp; Drug Free Schools; the Secret Service; and Bureau of Justice Statistics
&amp; School Crime &amp; Safety). </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In
regard to Cyberbullying, 1,000,000 children reported being harassed, threatened
or victims of internet bullying on Facebook alone-over the past year. Bullying
is increasingly viewed as an important contributor to youth violence, including
homicide and suicide. Cyberbullying gets worse as the internet grows (Consumer
Reports Survey, The American Justice Department &amp; wherepeacelives.org).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Not
only is youth violence a national problem, but a global public health problem.
It includes a range of acts from bullying and physical fighting, through more
severe sexual and physical assault to homicide. Worldwide some 250, 000 homicides
occur among youth 10–29 years of age each year, which is 43% of the total
number of homicides globally each year. For each young person killed, 20–40
more sustain injuries requiring hospital treatment. Youth violence has a
serious, often lifelong, impact on a person's psychological and social
functioning. Youth violence greatly increases the costs of health, welfare and
criminal justice services; reduces productivity; decreases the value of
property; and generally undermines the fabric of society (World Health Youth
Violence Fact Sheet, 2014).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Solid
Rock’s record of success includes a 98% “win/win” resolutions in Peer
Mediation; 96% success in the disputants completing togetherness projects to
build and mend relationships; and over 90% success rate in achieving caring and
cooperative behavior among program participants. Testimonies from the students,
parents, and administration are: “The program has kept me out of plenty of

</div> <p>And that's all there is to it!</p></div>","“Jumped” means beat-up by 25 other
peers. The youths said, “They deserved to be kicked in their face and head,” cause
they always in people’s business. Read more below... Oh, what a
frightening world we live in!
Solid
Rock Enterprise, Inc. passion to “EMPOWER & EQUIP THE CHILDREN &
YOUTH became more vivid after I, Arnetha Thomas/CEO, made the decision to
retired in 2005 to devote full-time work in making a difference in the
lives of student victims; teaching students about the juvenile justice
system; and how to avoid becoming entangled. This work began without funding of
any source, serving in Brownsville Middle urban school. The project later
received a small grant and more grants that expanded services in
helping to date over 1500 victim, delinquent, and disadvantage students
and families. 
We intervene
in bullying situations, peacefully resolve school & community
fights, rumors, disruptive classroom behaviors, stealing, graffiti, academic
failure, and more. Currently, we provide limited program services, due to the
lack of funding. Project utilizes graduate and undergraduate Social
Work Interns. My background includes expertise in conflict resolution and
reconciliation, program management, training, crisis intervention, and more. Administration and supported staff are trained experts in conflict resolution and reconciliation. Their experience also includes serving student victims, disadvantage youths, and families. The Board of Directors is comprised of professional to youth advocate of
diverse disciplines.
The
ability to empower and equip the children and youth is very
important to Solid Rock, the team, collaborative partners, and other stakeholders.  Unfortunately, fighting has become a way of life,  escalating to little and no empathy for their peers; “Jumped” by 25 other youths. The teens said,
“They deserved to be kicked in their face and head, cause they always in
people’s business."" The question was asked, “even if they died?’ The response
was “Yes.” Oh, what a frightening world we live in! So, this is the driving force motivating us to help rid the violence. These youngsters
must internalize and understand life has more to offer in positive ways.
To
help Solid Rock in this initiative, I, Arnetha Thomas/CEO have published a
children’s and Christian book titled: Beautiful As A Butterfly (hardcover), for
young and elementary age children. This book teaches responsibility, decision
making, and tells the child why they are beautiful as a butterfly. Beautiful As
A Butterfly retails for $24.99, but sale price $19.00. This includes shipping and tax. The Power of the Blood
at Work-Broken Veil (paperback) is for young to seasoned adults; and provides
spiritual, professional, and self-help development. Workbook included in the
back. This book retails for $14.95, but sale price $9.00. This includes shipping and tax. Other ways to support this
campaign is through personal contributions of any amount, such as $1 -
$5. We will accept more. We’re also asking that you share this campaign
with your family, friends, associates, business partners, social media friends,
and church members/affiliates. At the end of this campaign from March 15-31, 2015, Beautiful As A Butterfly ebook and Power of the Blood at Work Broken Veil ebook will be available for $1.00 each. Visit http:// www.arnethathomas.com and purchase your Ebook for $1.00 dollar.   


What We Need & What You Get



To
introduce and sustain empathy, children/youth must learn how to get along. They
must understand “TRADING PLACES” means pretending to be their peer and their
peer pretending to be them to understand each others feelings; then to respect
themselves and others. The empathy curriculum is based on Restorative Justice,
Kingian Nonviolence, and mediation all evidence based models or best practices.
The participant’s real life, day to day experiences that include rumors,
ranking, bullying, fighting, and not being soft will be used to successfully
engage their participation and internalize the importance of empathy. This
initiative also helps to build and mend relationships. The targeted 200 participants
will initially receive 12 hours of training by April 2015; and an additional 8 training hours throughout the 10-12 month period. During the initial phase they
will be certified as Peer Circle Gatekeepers (Facilitators). They will be responsible for facilitating circles with their peers to help them understand the importance of empathy and to put what they learned into practice. The Gatekeepers will participate in empathy  projects and benefit from cultural/educational field trips. 

We need $120,000 to support the “Trading Places” Kids
Helping Kids-Empathy Project. As the founder/CEO, my credentials include
Master’s in Social Work, National Restorative Justice, Kingian Nonviolence, and
Peer Mediation Trainer; and Family Mediator. 

The CEO will receive $50,000 to continue
overseeing and serving victim and disadvantage students and families in the
Restorative Justice Academy; oversee the Empathy Project; train and serve as
the lead facilitator in the workshops/training; provide the curriculum that’s
evidence based or best practices; and help publish the “Optimal Peer
Mediation"" book. 
$46, 000 will support two (2) 30 hours per/week staff that will preferably have a Bachelor’s degree in Social Work or related field. This staff will work with the training initiative, serving the targeted 200 disadvantage children and youth for a period of 10-12 months; along with support from the board, team, collaborative partners, other stakeholders, and trained volunteers. 
$20,000 will be used for advertisement that
includes social networks, radio, television, and flyer dissemination for
sustainability and expansion of Solid Rock’s initiatives that include the Empathy project. 
$4,000 will support cultural and educational
field trips.

Again for helping us, at the end of this campaign from March 15-31, 2015, Beautiful As A Butterfly ebook and Power of the Blood at Work Broken Veil ebook will be available for $1.00 each. Visit http:// www.arnethathomas.com and purchase your Ebook for $1.00 dollar.  
In
case we fail to receive all of the funding requested, Solid Rock is in the
process of requesting financial contributions and sponsorship from the
Children’s Trust, Miami Dade County, Longshoreman’s Association, Florida
Department of Juvenile Justice, Publix’s, Pizza Hut, churches and more. The
Empathy Project will continue as our primary focus. If we must, the number of
trained participants may be reduced by 25-100 participants. The CEO is
expected to receive approximately 25% of these funds to support the training,
curriculum, and curriculum tools. Instead of hiring 2 staff may hire only one. Will have to rely more on volunteers. The youth will continue to participate in projects, but field trips maybe reduced.
Never-the-less, we believe the Empathy Project Campaign will exceed our funding expectations. If so, we look forward to expanding this initiative. Please contact us at restorativejusticetraining@yahoo.com if interested in participating in the Empathy Project. 
The Impact 

""Bullying is everyone’s concern,"" says the Center for Disease Control (2009). Everyone
should care about the Empathy Project, because we all have been hurt directly
or indirectly by the epidemic in youth violence to include: homicide, injuries,
bullying, and fighting behaviors among our school age children/youth.  Research
shows crime and violence tend to be high in areas in which at least 20% of the
residents are poor. See the poverty and economic chart below.



This Empathy Project will primarily
target the Brownsville and surrounding communities. Brownsville
(33142) ranks as one of the poorest neighborhoods in the nation (U.S.
Census, 2010). Poverty is associated to violence. According to Goldstein and
Glick (1987), children and youth are de-sensitized to the daily community
violence of fighting and deaths resulting from drive by shootings and stray
bullets. Further indicated, “results of deficiencies in emotional
self-regulation caused by excessive exposure to social, family, and individual
risks lead to participation in delinquency activities, verbal, physical
aggression, victimization, and the internalization of antisocial value system. 
On
a national level, gun violence is the second leading cause of death for children
ages 1-19, but the leading cause of death for black American children
(Children’s Defense Fund, 2010). Black children and teens are twice as likely
to be killed by guns as by cars; the report notes, while white children and
teens are nearly three times more likely to die in car accidents instead of gun
violence. Then 30% of U.S. students in grades 6th -10th
are involved in moderate or frequent bullying as the bully, victim, or both. 8%
of students miss 1 day of class per month for fear of bullies (Department of
Health & Human Services; Center for Disease Control & Prevention; Safe
& Drug Free Schools; the Secret Service; and Bureau of Justice Statistics
& School Crime & Safety). 
In
regard to Cyberbullying, 1,000,000 children reported being harassed, threatened
or victims of internet bullying on Facebook alone-over the past year. Bullying
is increasingly viewed as an important contributor to youth violence, including
homicide and suicide. Cyberbullying gets worse as the internet grows (Consumer
Reports Survey, The American Justice Department & wherepeacelives.org).
Not
only is youth violence a national problem, but a global public health problem.
It includes a range of acts from bullying and physical fighting, through more
severe sexual and physical assault to homicide. Worldwide some 250, 000 homicides
occur among youth 10–29 years of age each year, which is 43% of the total
number of homicides globally each year. For each young person killed, 20–40
more sustain injuries requiring hospital treatment. Youth violence has a
serious, often lifelong, impact on a person's psychological and social
functioning. Youth violence greatly increases the costs of health, welfare and
criminal justice services; reduces productivity; decreases the value of
property; and generally undermines the fabric of society (World Health Youth
Violence Fact Sheet, 2014).
Solid
Rock’s record of success includes a 98% “win/win” resolutions in Peer
Mediation; 96% success in the disputants completing togetherness projects to
build and mend relationships; and over 90% success rate in achieving caring and
cooperative behavior among program participants. Testimonies from the students,
parents, and administration are: “The program has kept me out of plenty of
fights; I was ready to fight after peer mediation, but I didn’t have to; the program
really helped my daughter last year and I want her back in this year; and if it
wasn’t for the program, I don’t know what we would do.”  Risks & Challenges  


The
risks and challenges are: to sustain change requires more than 10-12 months of
serving the targeted population. Once the project ends and without
support, especially in a community tormented with violence the children and
youth will normally return to the lack of empathy for their peers.
The
plan to overcome this hurdle consists of training other organizations, schools,
and churches on the empathy curriculum. As a result, those trained will
duplicate and continue to work with the disadvantage children and youth to
increase empathy among their peers. Also, Solid Rock will organize a network to
facilitate the importance of this project and sustainability. This campaign includes 20% or we will dedicate a reduced amount toward sustainability to increase funding and expansion. Solid Rock and its
support systems are committed and will continue to seek grants, foundations, and private contributions; as well as, sponsorships to increase empathy among our children and youth. Finally, once the 45 day campaign has ended those interested can continue to purchase the sale products for a limited period of time, but can always make monetary contributions.

the CEO and trained in the areas of conflict resolution and

girls' education in Rwanda. Through Startoday Ltd, a registered consultancy
firm , Visit  https://twitter.com/startodayltd or https://www.facebook.com/StartodayLtd or http://www.ikaziwacu.blogspot.com  in collaboration with schools, NGOs and Parents , we identified 200 poor
young ladies who dropped out before they finish high school education due to
poverty or inability of their families to meet the cost of education. The
living conditions of these girls are very critical. Some of them have got
children before they got married, others are domestic workers while others are
underemployed. 
These girls are aged between
14 and 24 years from poor backgrounds that are more brilliants and want to join
existing Vocational Training Centers in Networking, Multimedia and Software.

We are now coming to you to seek your donation of any
amount. We need to raise  $124,200 USD. These funds will cover fees
for vocational training per 1 year, school materials and basic living
conditions of selected 200 young ladies. The following is the break down for fees for vocational training per trainee per year.

<h3>Bringing Chris Hedges to Montana's Capital<br/>
</h3>
<p></p>We have a great opportunity to bring Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and author Chris Hedges to Helena, Montana for a speaking engagement on March 11. His talk will be titled ""Wages of Rebellion: The Moral Imperative of Revolt."" <br/><br/>Hedges is widely seen as a thorn in the side of both political parties and the American elite, a deeply moral writer and activist whose works consistently peel back the veil of popular myth and illusion and expose our nation and culture for what they really are. Many see him as an iconoclast, a luminary. It is a great honor to bring such a speaker to Montana's capital and we don't aim to let the opportunity slip through our fingers. <br/><br/>He is a senior fellow at the Nation Institute and a regular columnist for the website <a href=""http://www.truthdig.com/staff/chris_hedges"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Truthdig.com</a>.

<b>Short Summary</b><br/><p></p> <p>Hi there! My name is Josh Blake <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1213263/files/20150210221414-168810_487546836871_3748603_n.jpg?1423635254"" src="""" style=""width: 185.95020746887968px; height: 231px;""/></p>
<p>and I'm the Show Manager of a singing &amp; dancing group called The New Dawn Singers Inc. We're a non-profit organization that was started in the 1960's by my father, John S. Blake, Jr. He had a vision to create a singing group made of young adults that could use their talents to reach the world. Over the years, the group has evolved into creating shows with costumes, dances, and lights/special effects. We have the opportunity of going into the elementary and middle schools across the country, bringing the students a 55-minute show that teaches them all about how to better themselves. The shows include high energy routines, colorful costumes and characters, skits, audience participation, and a fantastic message teaching them topics such as how important they are, how to become the best that they can be, and how to work together to achieve their goals. </p>
<p>This year, we're creating an assembly on the subject of bullying. These students need someone there in front of them letting them know it's going to be okay and that they are able to make it!  As I search the topic online, I've noticed that there's a need for a school assembly like this that gives them role models to look up to. It's an assembly they can relax and feel safe at and have fun while learning as well.</p>
<p>We need support in order to create the script, costumes, soundtrack, room and board for performers, and travel costs. The show is entitled, ""Exploring the C's"" and we'll be taking the students across the sea through the songs and skits, while trying to make it fun for them and still learn at the same time!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1213268/files/20150210221830-exploring_the_cs.jpg?1423635510"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>There are three ""C's"" that will divide the show into sections....Challenge, Connect, and Contribute. In which we'll relate the topics to their every day lives!</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We need to create the soundtrack for this show, so we'll be needing to hire a song writer/sound engineer to create quality audio tracks and performance rights. That is not a cheap process. We'll also be needing to create new costumes for the cast as well as rent a towing van to drive the trailer and equipment to the schools. </p>
<p>Most of these kids have never seen a live show before usually because they can't afford to go to anything like this outside of what their school provides for them as an assembly. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1213276/files/20150210222427-black_white.jpg?1423635867"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>It's an eye opening, jaw dropping, and loud cheering experience for them! I can attest to it, having experienced their reactions to it personally. It really DOES change their lives. I remember coming back into town years after the kids grew up and they saw us at Walmart and the cashier noticed us and said she remembered us from 8 years earlier and that it was her favorite day of the year. She said the kids in her class looked forward to the ""New Dawn Singers' Day"" all year!!! So I know that we're making a positive impact on them. That's why I'm excited about this! We had taken a couple years off because we couldn't afford to keep backing ourselves like we had been trying to, so we decided to take a break, but the schools are calling us and asking for another show. That's why we've decided to tour again. We knew it was the <b>right thing to do.</b> They need positive influence and encouragement. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1213280/files/20150210223015-tshirts4.jpg?1423636215"" src="""" style=""""/></p>We LOVE performing for these kids and getting to play a part in their lives. Please help us make this show the right way! If we reach the goal or even beyond it, I'll personally add a section into the show promoting this and letting the kids know that YOU helped make this show a reality and how it was all of you, working together to make something great happen! I think it would be a super way to show them how the world can all do something together! 
<p>Even if we don't reach the full goal, whatever funds are raised will still go towards the show and to the rental of the vehicle to bring the equipment to the performances because that's very necessary. </p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Like I said previously, the proof of impact is in how it shows in the students afterwards. They send us thank you letters in the mail, ask for autographs, want hugs or a high five, they walk through the halls singing the songs from the show, some go on the website and become fans, and they write us years later and tell us that they still remember the message and lessons that we taught and how they've applied it to their lives. Like I mentioned in the video, it just amazes me that we only perform 55 minutes out of the whole year.....yet they remember every minute of it. THAT says something to me and makes me proud to be a part of, not only the show itself, but the making and creation of it as well! :) </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The challenge that we'll be facing is creating the script  that'll deliver a strong enough message in dealing with bullying and how to overcome it.  I think that's the hardest part of the show each year when we create it. It's not only got to teach the students a good life lesson, but it's got to be fun and creative at the same time in order to keep their attention and allow them to remember it. We're doing this so that kids' lives can be changed.....so of course we're up for the challenge! :)</p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 30px;"">Other Ways You Can Help</span></p>
</div><div> <p>There are TONS of ways you can help. If you know anyone who is college age, can sing and dance really well, works well with others on the team, and has a positive personality that enjoys kids, please tell them about us and have them audition. (<a href=""http://www.newdawnsingers.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.newdawnsingers.com</a>) We'll be casting for the tour very soon. </p>
<p>I feel like some people might even be able to help by: </p>
<p>• If you have hotel chain connections, we need to house up to 10 performers/tech on tour for 2 months. You can guess how much that costs. We could use a discount or even donation just for that!</p>
<p>• If you are involved in audio sound equipment or even stage lighting companies, we are always in need of wireless headset microphones and LED stage lighting..all types. The kids LOVE anything that moves and looks cool. It's an instant ""Wow!"" reaction from the entire audience!!!</p>
<p>• If you have fabric connections, we go through theatrical fabrics like crazy. Sequins and heavy duty fabric doesn't come cheap, but is needed for the amount of wear and ""tear"" throughout the shows.</p>
<p>• Like I mentioned above, we need a quality van that tows. We've been using a family owned vehicle to pull the trailer but it's on its last wheel. (see what I did there!?) :) It'll drive the cast members to the show as well as tow our trailer.</p>
<p>• We wear through dance sneakers like crazy if any of you have any connections there as well. </p>
<p>• We always thought it would be neat for the students' sake if we could give a free poster to every student that comes to the performance as a momento.  I'm not sure if anyone has a way of printing large productions of posters that maybe they could donate the printing of? We can't afford it ourselves.</p>
<p>• Bulk bottled water and/or powerade would be appreciated as well for the performers. There is a lot of dancing involved and they work hard. </p>
<p>I'm just trying to think of ways people could help that's not exactly ""money"" involved. We could definitely use word of mouth to get the name out there and help book future tours. We also perform regular entertainment shows as well for amusement parks and a few other styles of performances like Holiday shows and Gospel concerts in churches. We go where ever we are needed and try to make people happy at each place we perform. </p>

<p><b>Thank you</b> for your time and all your consideration for this event! :) Let's change some lives! <br/></p>
</div></div>","Short Summary Hi there! My name is Josh Blake 
and I'm the Show Manager of a singing & dancing group called The New Dawn Singers Inc. We're a non-profit organization that was started in the 1960's by my father, John S. Blake, Jr. He had a vision to create a singing group made of young adults that could use their talents to reach the world. Over the years, the group has evolved into creating shows with costumes, dances, and lights/special effects. We have the opportunity of going into the elementary and middle schools across the country, bringing the students a 55-minute show that teaches them all about how to better themselves. The shows include high energy routines, colorful costumes and characters, skits, audience participation, and a fantastic message teaching them topics such as how important they are, how to become the best that they can be, and how to work together to achieve their goals. 
This year, we're creating an assembly on the subject of bullying. These students need someone there in front of them letting them know it's going to be okay and that they are able to make it!  As I search the topic online, I've noticed that there's a need for a school assembly like this that gives them role models to look up to. It's an assembly they can relax and feel safe at and have fun while learning as well.
We need support in order to create the script, costumes, soundtrack, room and board for performers, and travel costs. The show is entitled, ""Exploring the C's"" and we'll be taking the students across the sea through the songs and skits, while trying to make it fun for them and still learn at the same time!

There are three ""C's"" that will divide the show into sections....Challenge, Connect, and Contribute. In which we'll relate the topics to their every day lives!   What We Need & What You Get We need to create the soundtrack for this show, so we'll be needing to hire a song writer/sound engineer to create quality audio tracks and performance rights. That is not a cheap process. We'll also be needing to create new costumes for the cast as well as rent a towing van to drive the trailer and equipment to the schools. 
Most of these kids have never seen a live show before usually because they can't afford to go to anything like this outside of what their school provides for them as an assembly. 

It's an eye opening, jaw dropping, and loud cheering experience for them! I can attest to it, having experienced their reactions to it personally. It really DOES change their lives. I remember coming back into town years after the kids grew up and they saw us at Walmart and the cashier noticed us and said she remembered us from 8 years earlier and that it was her favorite day of the year. She said the kids in her class looked forward to the ""New Dawn Singers' Day"" all year!!! So I know that we're making a positive impact on them. That's why I'm excited about this! We had taken a couple years off because we couldn't afford to keep backing ourselves like we had been trying to, so we decided to take a break, but the schools are calling us and asking for another show. That's why we've decided to tour again. We knew it was the right thing to do. They need positive influence and encouragement. 

We LOVE performing for these kids and getting to play a part in their lives. Please help us make this show the right way! If we reach the goal or even beyond it, I'll personally add a section into the show promoting this and letting the kids know that YOU helped make this show a reality and how it was all of you, working together to make something great happen! I think it would be a super way to show them how the world can all do something together! 
Even if we don't reach the full goal, whatever funds are raised will still go towards the show and to the rental of the vehicle to bring the equipment to the performances because that's very necessary.    The Impact Like I said previously, the proof of impact is in how it shows in the students afterwards. They send us thank you letters in the mail, ask for autographs, want hugs or a high five, they walk through the halls singing the songs from the show, some go on the website and become fans, and they write us years later and tell us that they still remember the message and lessons that we taught and how they've applied it to their lives. Like I mentioned in the video, it just amazes me that we only perform 55 minutes out of the whole year.....yet they remember every minute of it. THAT says something to me and makes me proud to be a part of, not only the show itself, but the making and creation of it as well! :) 
    Risks & Challenges The challenge that we'll be facing is creating the script  that'll deliver a strong enough message in dealing with bullying and how to overcome it.  I think that's the hardest part of the show each year when we create it. It's not only got to teach the students a good life lesson, but it's got to be fun and creative at the same time in order to keep their attention and allow them to remember it. We're doing this so that kids' lives can be changed.....so of course we're up for the challenge! :)
Other Ways You Can Help
 There are TONS of ways you can help. If you know anyone who is college age, can sing and dance really well, works well with others on the team, and has a positive personality that enjoys kids, please tell them about us and have them audition. (www.newdawnsingers.com) We'll be casting for the tour very soon. 
I feel like some people might even be able to help by: 
• If you have hotel chain connections, we need to house up to 10 performers/tech on tour for 2 months. You can guess how much that costs. We could use a discount or even donation just for that!
• If you are involved in audio sound equipment or even stage lighting companies, we are always in need of wireless headset microphones and LED stage lighting..all types. The kids LOVE anything that moves and looks cool. It's an instant ""Wow!"" reaction from the entire audience!!!
• If you have fabric connections, we go through theatrical fabrics like crazy. Sequins and heavy duty fabric doesn't come cheap, but is needed for the amount of wear and ""tear"" throughout the shows.
• Like I mentioned above, we need a quality van that tows. We've been using a family owned vehicle to pull the trailer but it's on its last wheel. (see what I did there!?) :) It'll drive the cast members to the show as well as tow our trailer.
• We wear through dance sneakers like crazy if any of you have any connections there as well. 
• We always thought it would be neat for the students' sake if we could give a free poster to every student that comes to the performance as a momento.  I'm not sure if anyone has a way of printing large productions of posters that maybe they could donate the printing of? We can't afford it ourselves.
• Bulk bottled water and/or powerade would be appreciated as well for the performers. There is a lot of dancing involved and they work hard. 
I'm just trying to think of ways people could help that's not exactly ""money"" involved. We could definitely use word of mouth to get the name out there and help book future tours. We also perform regular entertainment shows as well for amusement parks and a few other styles of performances like Holiday shows and Gospel concerts in churches. We go where ever we are needed and try to make people happy at each place we perform.

This beautiful book is the most comprehensive and authoritative source of information about ayahuasca, the extraordinary vine from the Amazon that is finding more widespread use for healing, spiritual awakening and a new ecological awareness. Edited by two renowned experts in the field, Luis Eduardo Luna and Steven F. White, this book provides a vital and timely transmission of knowledge, including contributions from Amazonian shamans, scientific researchers, visionary artists, primary historical sources, and other experts who have had significant experience of the wisdom of ayahuasca. Given the importance of this knowledge, we have committed to spreading this message far beyond standard publishing scenarios.""The Ayahuasca Reader explains the necessity of integrating ayahuasca into Western culture, and educated its readers to do their part to facilitate that process."" - Rick Doblin, Founder, Executive Director, MAPSSynergetic Press is mounting a global publishing and educational outreach campaign about ayahuasca. With growing interest in this plant medicine, more people are discovering the many health benefits of this potent brew, including the treatment of conditions ranging from Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s to PTSD and depression.But at the same time that Western doctors and researchers are taking note of its potential for humanity, the very cultures and rainforest environment where it came from continue to be threatened and we risk losing irreplaceable knowledge, as well as the healing plants themselves. The Ayahuasca Reader Campaign aims to shine a bright light on this relatively unknown plant and the cultures who have used ayahuasca for thousands of years. Our goal is to inform people across all sectors – from environmentalists to psychologists, from entertainers to philanthropists, from anthropologists to corporate leaders – about the healing benefits of ayahuasca, the ""vine of the soul,"" its transformative powers and potential to promote well-being for people and planet. ""... An interdisciplinary cornucopia, a comprehensive volume overflowing with valuable insights, paradigm-shifting discoveries, and a bounty of rare knowledge. A wide variety of perspectives are expressed, and a broad range of disciplines are utilized, in this extraordinary collection of essays, written by a stellar cast of contributors.  David Jay Brown, author of Dreaming Wide Awake Why Is The Information In This Book So Important Now?The Ayahuasca Reader tells the story of ayahuasca from many perspectives. The book explores the many aspects of this healing brew, providing cultural context from Amazonian shamans, offering a wealth of scientific and medical understanding, detailing its spiritual and religious use, as well as illustrating its role in both literary and artistic expression.The book includes contributions from over forty of the most respected authorities such as Richard Spruce, Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff, Ralph Metzner, Dennis McKenna, Wade Davis, Graham Hancock, Susana Bustos, Luis Eduardo Luna, Alex Grey, Allyson Grey, Martina Hoffmann and many others, whose work, when taken as a whole, is indeed potent medicine itself.Why We Are Launching This Campaign & Use of Raised FundsSynergetic Press does more than just publish books. We promote evolutionary ideas through books, both print and digital, as well as holding symposiums and salons, producing webinars and podcasts. The money generated through this campaign helps us to pay for costs of printing and permission fees for this quality anthology, international marketing efforts, educational outreach and distribution to non-traditional outlets. As a small, independent publisher, our team is composed of a few passionate individuals who are dedicated to spreading these ideas at this vital moment in time.The funds raised will get enable us to get the book to leaders of influential organizations around the world, developing partnerships with groups working in both consciousness and environmentalism, extending the book’s content through social media channels, and organizing interdisciplinary symposiums (with three initial events already planned for New York, London and San Francisco). It will help us to launch an online quarterly Synergy Journal to circulate news, events and informative content related to this and our other titles.Earth Consciousness event in Santa Fe, April 2016Thanks in Advance for Your Support!We can’t do it alone.

Regenerative medicine holds the promise of that life by revolutionizing how we practice medicine. <span>I want to learn how to work in regenerative medicine to bring these innovations to patients who need it. I want to bring this skill set back to Canada, and to Saskatchewan especially. </span>In order to do this, I am taking a year to do research in regenerative medicine. I have two offers from leading researchers at world-renowned research institutes, but I need your help to pay for these opportunities. Please join with me so that together we can work to help bring regenerative medicine to people who need it.<br/><br/><b>What is regenerative medicine?</b><br/>Regenerative medicine is a fascinating field that makes use of stem 
cells, tissue engineering, gene therapy, cellular communication, and 
even bionic devices to develop new medical treatments, and has the 
potential to revolutionize the practice of medicine. Two researchers in Canada, Doctors James Till and Ernest McCulloch, were the first to demonstrate the existence of stem cells in 1961  (Dr. Till was born in Lloydminster and attended the University of Saskatchewan). Since that time, there have been many advances in the field, and there have already been several examples of treatment successes with regenerative medicine. <br/><br/>As the research continues to push forward, the successes grow every year. In centres around the world, research continues to develop many other 
treatments, including cartilage to treat arthritis, blood vessels for 
by-pass surgeries, growing heart valves, repairing the heart after a 
heart attack, repairing spinal cord injuries to allow paraplegics and 
quadriplegics to walk again, stem cell transplants to treat blindness, 
therapies to treat genetic diseases, new ways to test pharmaceuticals, and even printing and growing complex organs. 
The revolutionary potential of regenerative medicine is awe
 inspiring.<br/><br/>Some of this research has already begun to be used to treat patients. In 2006, researchers at the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine reported on their success in creating new bladders for patients with a severe form of spina bifida that also affects the bladder. Last year (2014), using a combination of off-the-shelf biological scaffold materials and targeted physiotherapy, researchers at the McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine were able to help trauma victims and veterans wounded in combat to regrow new muscle and tendon tissue, and gain a much-improved quality of life. In April 2013, a 2 ½-year-old girl from Korea was given a trachea grown using stem cells and a plastic scaffold after she was born without a trachea, and this technique has also been used in cancer treatments. Scientists and doctors have developed technology to treat burn patients, including growing skin for skin grafts and spray guns to deposit skin stem cells on burns. Researchers here in Canada, including physician scientists here in Saskatchewan, have played a pioneering role in the use of stem cell transplants for treatment of Parkinson's Disease. There are many others therapies that have been and are being proven in clinical trials. People are already benefiting from regenerative medicine treatments, and there is potential for so much more.<br/><br/><b>Why am I doing this?</b><br/>I recently graduated from the University 
of Saskatchewan College of Medicine in Saskatoon, SK, Canada, and I have
 decided to take a year off between medical school and residency 
training to do research in regenerative medicine. Regenerative 
medicine has been an interest of mine since I was 12 when saw the tissue
 engineering proof-of-concept Vacanti mouse on a TV show. Seeing how 
they grew this surgically-implanted ear using tissue engineering, I was inspired, and I knew
 there was so many more possibilities in this area. When I decided
 to become a medical doctor, I knew regenerative medicine was an area 
that I wanted to work in; there is so much potential to help people  by providing better treatments than what we have now. I have made efforts
 to learn about regenerative medicine during my education: I 
participated in a tissue engineering 
research project trying to develop a way to repair damaged nerves using 
stem cells, and I attended two week-long courses in the US on 
regenerative medicine. But there are few physicians working in 
regenerative medicine, so I have not had experience with regenerative 
medicine in a clinical setting. My career goal is to focus on 
regenerative 
medicine so I can help bring this exciting field to the bedside. Some day, I would like to see a centre for regenerative medicine research here in Saskatoon. However,
 regenerative medicine is not a clinical specialty, meaning that I will 
need to find my own way into this field from the clinical side. From my 
experiences over the next year, I hope to learn more about my career 
options, and I will use that to guide my training towards a medical 
career in regenerative medicine.<br/><br/><b>What am I going to be doing?</b><br/>Over the next year, I have two offers from researchers at world-leading research institutes to come do research under their guidance. I have an offer for three months at the Medical Research Council Centre for Regenerative Medicine in Edinburgh, UK with Dr. Pierre Bagnaninchi and Dr. Leonard Nelson. In the new year, I have another offer for four months at the University of Pittsburgh McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine with Dr. Stephen Badylak. For the purpose of these two research observerships, I will be considered a visiting scholar.<br/><br/>There are also a series of major conferences that have been organized in the next academic year that I am going to attend. I attended the TERMIS World Congress 2015 in Boston, MA; this was the Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine International Society's major conference that is held every three years. The World Conference on Regenerative Medicine being held in Leipzig, DE is a major interdisciplinary conference held in Europe. The Till &amp; McCulloch Meetings are being held in Toronto, ON this year, and feature the major players in regenerative medicine here in Canada. These conferences are holding panels to discuss career prospects and planning in regenerative medicine that would really help me to decide on a career path for medical specialty training.<br/><br/><b>Why am I doing crowdfunding?</b><br/>I am very excited to take part in these learning opportunities, and to find my career in regenerative medicine, but I have hit a few roadblocks. I need to come up with enough funding to cover minimum wage in these countries before they will officially offer me the positions. However, there are also a lot of other expenses that I will encounter over the next year, including travel expenses, conference fees, work visas, etc. Unfortunately, I am falling between the cracks for funding. I am no longer a student and I have not started residency, which means that I do not qualify for scholarships and student loans. I am also not an employed faculty member, researcher, nor licenced physician, meaning I do not have a salary nor can I apply for research grants that would normally fund my research work. There appears to be no funding for endeavours like what I am doing, so I have to go this alone. I have been trying to find funding for several months, but everything has come up empty, which is why I have decided to try crowdfunding. <br/><br/>I need your help to do this, so please contribute to my fund, and please share my request with everyone you know. Together we can make this amazing learning opportunity happen.

need to find my own way into this field from the clinical side. From my 
experiences over the next year, I hope to learn more about my career 
options, and I will use that to guide my training towards a medical 
career in regenerative medicine.What am I going to be doing?Over the next year, I have two offers from researchers at world-leading research institutes to come do research under their guidance. I have an offer for three months at the Medical Research Council Centre for Regenerative Medicine in Edinburgh, UK with Dr. Pierre Bagnaninchi and Dr. Leonard Nelson. In the new year, I have another offer for four months at the University of Pittsburgh McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine with Dr. Stephen Badylak. For the purpose of these two research observerships, I will be considered a visiting scholar.There are also a series of major conferences that have been organized in the next academic year that I am going to attend. I attended the TERMIS World Congress 2015 in Boston, MA; this was the Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine International Society's major conference that is held every three years. The World Conference on Regenerative Medicine being held in Leipzig, DE is a major interdisciplinary conference held in Europe. The Till & McCulloch Meetings are being held in Toronto, ON this year, and feature the major players in regenerative medicine here in Canada. These conferences are holding panels to discuss career prospects and planning in regenerative medicine that would really help me to decide on a career path for medical specialty training.Why am I doing crowdfunding?I am very excited to take part in these learning opportunities, and to find my career in regenerative medicine, but I have hit a few roadblocks. I need to come up with enough funding to cover minimum wage in these countries before they will officially offer me the positions. However, there are also a lot of other expenses that I will encounter over the next year, including travel expenses, conference fees, work visas, etc. Unfortunately, I am falling between the cracks for funding. I am no longer a student and I have not started residency, which means that I do not qualify for scholarships and student loans. I am also not an employed faculty member, researcher, nor licenced physician, meaning I do not have a salary nor can I apply for research grants that would normally fund my research work. There appears to be no funding for endeavours like what I am doing, so I have to go this alone. I have been trying to find funding for several months, but everything has come up empty, which is why I have decided to try crowdfunding. I need your help to do this, so please contribute to my fund, and please share my request with everyone you know. Together we can make this amazing learning opportunity happen. Thank you for your support!If you would like more information about either research institutions, here are the links to their websites:MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine http://www.crm.ed.ac.uk/McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine http://www.mirm.pitt.edu/P.S.

What we need to do is raise funds for venue, travel costs, and his modest honorarium request. If you've heard him speak or read his blog, you know that Aron Ra is a well-reasoned freethinker with a nearly encyclopedic knowledge on a number of issues.</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Aron Ra has asked for a very modest honorarium of $250 and some assistance with travel expenses. Additionally, we would like to host this at a venue that will allow for folks from Chattanooga and the surrounding area to sit comfortably, hear him clearly, and have an opportunity to easily interact with him. In total, we think we can provide all this at a cost of about $2,000.</p>
<p>There will be guaranteed admission for those who contribute $10 or more towards  the campaign. <br/></p>
<p>By contributing $50 or more, you will have an additional opportunity to join Aron Ra at a dinner following the lecture for a more intimate discussion. (Food and beverage costs not included)
</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Chattanooga rarely hosts such high profile speakers on the subject of freethought/non-religion. This is an amazing opportunity to have one of the leading thinkers on this subject in this traditionally bible-minded region of the country. We realistically think we have the opportunity to reach as many as 200 people in the region.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>We know there's a lot of interest in the IDEA of Aron Ra speaking, but we need YOUR support to make it a REALITY. If we can't get close to our goal, the entire event will suffer from lack of comfort, ability to host a good crowd, and difficulty in hearing the lecture. Let's make sure we show Aron that freethought is alive and well in Chattanooga!</div>

   What We Need & What You Get Aron Ra has asked for a very modest honorarium of $250 and some assistance with travel expenses. Additionally, we would like to host this at a venue that will allow for folks from Chattanooga and the surrounding area to sit comfortably, hear him clearly, and have an opportunity to easily interact with him. In total, we think we can provide all this at a cost of about $2,000.
There will be guaranteed admission for those who contribute $10 or more towards  the campaign. 
By contributing $50 or more, you will have an additional opportunity to join Aron Ra at a dinner following the lecture for a more intimate discussion. (Food and beverage costs not included)



    The Impact Chattanooga rarely hosts such high profile speakers on the subject of freethought/non-religion. This is an amazing opportunity to have one of the leading thinkers on this subject in this traditionally bible-minded region of the country. We realistically think we have the opportunity to reach as many as 200 people in the region.

    Risks & Challenges
We know there's a lot of interest in the IDEA of Aron Ra speaking, but we need YOUR support to make it a REALITY. If we can't get close to our goal, the entire event will suffer from lack of comfort, ability to host a good crowd, and difficulty in hearing the lecture. Let's make sure we show Aron that freethought is alive and well in Chattanooga!

<br/><p>Hey everyone! My name is Joy and I am the founder of the sustainable non-profit organization Pendo Kenia e. V. I started in 2011 with a vision to create safe spaces for Kenyan children to gain education while contributing to the surrounding community. In partnership with Forum for Orphans in Malindi (FOM), my father’s organization, we set out to build a better future by building schools for orphans and needy children in the rural area, and giving sustainable knowledge to the surrounding community. Fast forward 4 years, 9 schools, and nearly 1,000 students later, it is safe to say that we are headed in the right direction. <br/></p>

Currently students are using the surrounding grounds of the school as a restroom, which results in many illnesses among the children.

The children do not have shoes, so when walking in the sand, the parasites penetrate through the skin on their feet. We are doing a health-care prog ram with each school that provides a nurse on a monthly basis to take care of the health of the children, but without a sanitation system it is hard to tackle this problem.
